 do you think they will even enforce this? you're not allowed to smoke at bus stops either but people still do it 









 will never happen in a million years in this country they'll run a scare campaign about people who have died from it and it will never get off the ground

they would much rather continue fighting the failed drug war 




 at least he did it in practice and not the race 




 For me in my region most servers on the browers are the surf maps and what not for some reason there are no normal map servers 




 I think that speaks volumes about the quality of other maps...  They all should be balanced well instead of favouring one team over the other  




 i highly doubt they'll keep him they are already eying other drivers like bottas

will be a shame but his performance hasn't been great

if he goes we'll need a new driver for hilarious radio messages 




 should this be something a school teaches or something parents/friends should help people with if they don't know how to do it?

personally i always used an accountant because i found a cheap one and he was able to find a lot more savings then i would of. 

though doing taxes isn't that hard 









 the issue is casual doesn't let you exclude maps and the other maps in that group are good 




 i really don't get how people can play it so much especially the people who've been playing CS since it came out 




 i would rather some variety playing the same map over and over gets boring even if it's a good map

besides if you know nothing about a map you learn it by playing it 




 its like some people just can't get enough of it that they have to constantly vote for it a gazillion times

just played a few rounds of casual for fun and dust2 was voted for 3 times (twice in a row) happens every day

maps been out for like (15 years?) you would think people wouldn't want to play it every 5 seconds  




 it's still awesome as well so much better than diablo 3 




 of course they knew they just didn't care

they know gamers will pre order/buy it anyway 




 they could of used any respectful Muslim (community leaders or just your average joe) instead of using this dickhead

they used him because they knew it would cause a stir and that's good for ratings.
 




 it's good that they got the warning the dickhead should never of been on the show in the first place

 




 bank transfer paypal or bitcoins dealers will always find a way if we go cashless 




 considering how much money they spend on a race you would think they could get better trophies 




 the thing that annoys me the most is when people put unpitted olives on pizzas and in salads

 




 this entire situation is beyond pathetic now it's obviously brought up now to get the Aussies to buy the book 




 used to work at maccas don't see how this will work at all stores especially those with only 1 or 2 grills

eggs need their own grill (different temperature can't cook them on a meat one etc) so that would take a half of a grill out all day long that could be used during busy periods for meat

 




 so what business model is a local hardware shop that employs a few people going to implement when a Bunnings opens down the road?

many small shops are in similar situations 

 




 McDonald's is like that everywhere both franchise and company owned

however they won't raise the regular crew pay much higher than the minimum as they are unskilled if they get into the manager positions the pay is actually pretty decent 




 lot of people think pay rises are always good they don't think of the people who will lose their jobs/have shifts cut or the fact that businesses will hire less people

 




 it was criminals he killed people don't tend to care about criminals which is why the movie and what not was so popular

a extremist muslim threatening terrorist attacks is much different to that even if he didn't carry it out

 




 many businesses might not hire as much staff now or they will reduce the casual staffs shifts (over 18's mostly) to the bare minimum 




 many small businesses struggle to stay open as it is you got to remember they have competition with other small business and the big businesses that come in and screw them all over

lots of cafe's and what not  don't open on sundays because they just can't pay the increased rate 




 doesn't matter that mallah didn't kill he's a Muslim terrorist that threatened Australians 




 How much are businesses going to raise prices now they are paying employees more?  




 Big business yes small businesses might not be able to afford to pay If they have a few employees 




 Wasn't it criminals that chopper killed? If so that's why people see him as a hero you don't see other killers that killed innocent people lifted to that status

In regards to the Muslim terrorist once you make threats you'll never lose the status of a terrorist  




 considering the book is about making bombs etc it's not a good idea to try and import it giving the current situation with all the terrorism laws etc

you're just asking for trouble 




 yep consumer advice, the usual dodgy tradie bit, something on binge drinking and hoons 




 lots of people grew to hate them because of it the next election greens got far less seats 




 should we hand out cotton wool as well.. entire generations of kids played on those just fine 




 who didn't see this coming terrible idea banning smoking in a jail

won't be surprised if violence rises substantially even after these riots  









 i don't even own a home it's the reality of the situation and many people are starting to move away from the city to get a affordable house

areas like gosford etc are cheaper than sydney and it's only an hour and a half by train to the city 




 I know it's a beta but it really needs more content it's still fun but playing the same maps and modes is getting boring 




 Too bad you either find a house that's affordable or you rent closer to the city the house prices are not coming down any time soon 




 They can if they move out of the city but many are not willing too as their job is likely in the city and they don't want to make the long commute 









 people standing on both sides of the escalator.. ffs stay on one side to allow people to walk up/down them 




 only walked out of one and it was because it was a commission only shitty sales job where you are supposed to sell some waterless car wash crap in a can to people in a car park

part of the interview was to follow one of the workers around to see them in action i just walked off and went home

no where on the application did it state that was the job and i needed stable work not a commission only sales job 




 never found either Amy Poehler or tina fay funny 




 not surprising given how many Americans believe in creationism 




 41% of Americans are stupid 




 as long as he is at williams i doubt he'll ever get another shot at a WDC

williams won't win as a customer team 




 i think many companies would jump at the opportunity to buy one of these if they can get a house done in 2 or so days they will be able to take more jobs on

builders now take a few jobs and spend time at each over the course of a few weeks

besides it's still going to need people to load and maintain it 




 apparently the average age of bricklayers is going up as well not as many young people taking the job 




 many people have lost jobs over the years when something better has been invented

if this robot can do it quicker and cheaper it will replace brickies in the long run 




 what Australian company would have a distribution network like coke though? 




 Coca-Cola already uses its distribution networks to deliver drugs for HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria in a number of African nations, in partnership with the Global Fund, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

coke would have good distribution networks i don't see any issue with this if it helps aid
