 Was she in a car when she told him that? He told her to swerve. I assume she's in a car then. 




 So he has one cart on there at that moment, and that makes him lazy? 




 Fuck off with this 9gag shit. 




 Sick of seeing him. Like someone said before me, stop giving him attention please. 




 In a deleted scene, Rose and Jack tried to both get on but the combined weight was too much for the door. James Cameron also teamed up with the Mythbusters and tested it out. They confirmed that only one person was able to be on the door and have it be able to stay afloat. 




 I thought that too. 




 That's true. 




 My fucking life right here... 




 It was way to easy to take it another way. 




 Congrats on getting it fixed! My father has the same situation. 




 I knew I saw a famous queen perform it! It skipped my mind all throughout the lipsync. I just love Lady Bunny. 




 After site #3 I've stopped bothering and deleted my profiles.  




 He calls his dad "son"? 




 Exactly. 




 He's cute too but I don't think this goes here 




 Oh how I can count the times this exactly happened.. 




 Both maybe. I would certainly feel like this a lot but never express it to someone. I would lean towards pity perhaps. 




 That face ;) 









 Looks like bees who have left their nest and have gone out to find a new nest. 




 Cleft pallet 




 What is wtf about it 




 Gtfo repost 




 I just love how hairy Josh is. 




 Goddamn repost. 




 I have never seen a religious billboard in my part of Texas. 




 Texas isn't an easy place to live when you're LGBT. I love Texas, but people who do this thing is what makes me the most uncomfortable. Keep your head up. If you're that desperate to get out though, Austin is a good place to visit. Mind if I ask where in Texas you are? 




 Don't know what it is, but it's definitely not maggots. 




 Where are her ankles?? 









 I would use something else than hippie but that's just me 




 I found it in like 5 seconds.. Bottom to top second to last row 




 Kirsten Stewart look-alike? 




 Ooo source please 




 The second picture was taken at a different angle 




 Hey, it's his cunt. Dont fuk wit him 




 Prepare ur anus 




 I've seen this posted months ago. 




 I second that 




 Yeah it is. 




 Yeah it's an actual gang tactic now. 




 I shouldn't say just Americans. Just any country that views animals the same way. 




 It's a taboo in a lot of countries and I don't agree with it but if you put it in their perspective, it's no different from other animals. Americans view dogs and cats differently than people in the East. In their culture it's completely ok to do this. Yes it's fucked up, but you have to look at it their way: in a lot of cases it's either eat or starve. 




 I didn't know that. That's pretty smart. I used to smoke and never heard of doing that. 




 This was posted already today, 6 minutes before you, but that one is a repost already. Repost of a repost. 




 Cigarettes in the freezer? 




 There is nothing wrong here... 




 It's already one of the top posts of all time on there

 The things I would do to him.. 




 Oh Farm Boy! My field needs plowing. 




 He showers in his tears 




 Dee and the Waitress from It's Always Sunny in Philidelphia. 




 Lamprey mouth photoshopped onto someone's eye? Am I right? 




 That's a guy? Huh. 




 All it really is, is a cry for attention. She calls herself names so someone will tell her otherwise. I tire of seeing it and dealing with people who act like this.  




 I thought he had downs at first.. 




 lol 




 But it is funny. Where the rest though? There more to this photo that didn't get posted I guess. 




 Calm down. It was just a suggestion.  




 Anyone have names? 




 That would make it Christmas for me. I have the hots for him and the other two off of Workaholics. 




 If they don't find out who it is through security footage, you can always save a sample and send it off to a lab for DNA testing, which you can do with shit. People don't realize that their DNA is nearly everywhere. Locard's Principle: "Every contact leaves a trace." 




 It's just the flavor 




 Where is this from? 




 Isn't the one in the white a pornstar? 




 Isn't the one in the white a pornstar? 




 My thought exactly 




 A pretty popular South Park joke where Chef's parents were always being tricked out of $3.50 by the lochness monster.  




 Gawd damn lochness monster tricked me again! 




 Drag.  He could do drag.
