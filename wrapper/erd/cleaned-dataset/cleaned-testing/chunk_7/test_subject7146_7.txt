They are every bit as nutty as the bible-thumpers.

edit: Thinking back on it, nutty is the wrong word. I should have said they are as quick to attack others who don't believe as they do as the bible-thumpers. God, tons of that crap was just plain vicious. 




 Ooooh, good one. I wonder if we can get "antfucker" mainstream. 




 I have to disagree. I'm reasonably sure they aren't plants, and pretty damn sure they aren't minerals. They think and move on their own accord. Pretty sure that falls under the animal umbrella. 




  It was taken in a friend's backyard about 8 years ago when he thought it was just fog.

He was right. 




 You wouldn't need string, just something to tap the tops of the DVDs while hiding on the other sides of the shelves. Far too easy to stage. 




 Well, odds greatly favor other life. There is, of course, doubt until it's proven. 




 THANK YOU! This is exactly how I feel. I mean, come on, did anyone see anything in the example video that didn't look like debris, or floating particles, or water droplet (really? you could see the image behind it refracted upside-down), or a glare? And crop circles have been debunked over and over, and yet people still believe aliens are coming to earth to draw pictures in fields. The simplest way to quickly produce a giant image, by knocking down wheat. How easy is that? No way a human can do it? How about a group of friends looking to have fun and having the time to plan it all out? Jesus christ. 




 lol Same here. I click a post on Reddit News, click to open in browser, click the little Imgur link underneath, then can watch on the Imgur site in my browser. It's ridiculous, and anymore I just skip those videos on my phone. 




 Mine does this on ICS. It only does it on the lockscreen or pull down because the time is automatically shown elsewhere, and since having 2 times shown on the phone is a bit redundant, it's making room at the top for more notifications. 




 Why would you have multiple tvs playing different videos? Who likes to listen to multiple songs at once?  




 Don't use rokus for what you want, it will not work right,they'll never show the same thing at the same time, so you definitely can't have sound on them both.  
Look for a hdmi transmitter instead. Read reviews, google a bit, and look to see if they can use multiple receivers. Much simpler option as well.  




 Wouldn't work at all, there are 2 rokus. They wouldn't be in sync. He needs something wireless that is controlled by the computer, not the receiver (roku).  




 Can confirm? Why, because her legs are missing? You, sir, must be an expert in your field.  




 When Tia Leoni turns to her father right before the wave gets them and says "Daddy" in Deep Impact always hits me. Not a great movie, but I'm a single dad raising my daughter and it destroys me if I think about us in a terrible situation like that.  




 It's my cake day? Huh.  
And I'm a dog man, but haven't had one for many years. No particular reason, but my dogs I've had over the years have always found me. I don't go looking for a pet, it just happens.  




 Oh, well if everyone else was fucked up, it's perfectly fine to drive high. Nice logic. 




 Fuck dumb-ass kids who want to drive stoned. Of course you should have been reported. 




 This is exactly how I think I would be if I was an officer. 




 What's wrong with normal Titanium Backup backups? You can just save only the apps you want to reinstall in a separate folder, and batch install them.  




 Noticing foreigners is racism?  
I hate overseas support myself. I have a terrible time making out what they're saying. I don't hate others for their nationality, I just want to talk to someone without asking them to repeat themselves the entire discussion,and still not catching everything they say.  




 I drive a car.  




 Because guys will sometimes spend their limited cash on lift kits, roll bars, brush guards, huge mud tires, etc. 




 Exactly speaking, you're talking power, not size. I've seen some big ass trucks with a straight six in it.  




 That would be more power, not bigger.  
edit: though a certain amount of size would be needed, it doesn't mean bigger is better. 




 Yeah, if you need to accessorize your mullet.  




 I've met guys with huge shlongs (usually hear about them from someone else, btw.) They almost always say that they have problems with getting laid. Women generally don't like painful sex. 




 Gotta disagree there, depends on what aspect you're considering. Heating costs, cleaning, repairs, etc. 




 Why's that? 




 I always give 0 tours a chance. When I see their set up and/or upgrades and they're terrible, I'll say something. Let them know what they're doing wrong. If they're willing to listen to others, and try to get things right, then awesome. I'll help carry them as much as possible. But the ones who won't listen (I always ask if they speak English first, just to make sure), and refuse to turn on voice to hear us (really?), yeah, I have no problem with a kick. This tour is costing me time and money, I really don't want to waste either on a fucktard.

edit: I have 41 tours, just started in Dec, have 4 aussies, and heavy like a champ. The first thing I did before playing was READ THE FORUMS. Saved me a lot of hassle, and I've only been kicked once (for AFK, but I deserved it.) 




 Neat, but it's only built for the sake of making something cool. You can put a grate on the ground with 4 or 5 inch gaps and the cows won't walk on it. We have plenty of them here in Illinois.  




 Helium - App Sync and Backup will do that, I believe. If not, just search through the slough of backup apps on the market. I use Titanium Backup for that myself, but it's for rooted phones.  




 A large group of individuals are currently in talks to get the rights to it. It's a slow process with no promise of fruitful results, but it's ongoing. Look through some previous posts for more info, as well as spiritual successors in the works.  




 City of Heroes. It'll be years before anything overtakes that.  




 I've had sex in a pool, didn't bother us at all. It was actually very freeing, position wise. We did decline swimming invites for a while afterwards.

 Facebook is a massive power-hungry app when everything is working correctly anyway. I think it's got the top spot, in fact. There are alternatives that are much more friendly to your cpu. Fast for Facebook is what I use.  
I realize this really doesn't answer your question, but I wanted to put that out there.  




 This one always seemed like it had a bunch of content in it, but I found it insanely boring. The only enjoyment I ever found was in seeing how fast I could spin the spinner.  




 TV system, not TV.  




 The little guy who dives into the bathtub? I took him with me to see King Kong in '76 and lost him. I loved that guy.  :( 




 I was looking for the dumbest, gayest board game ever, but it seems I've been beaten to it.  




 Ugh, could a more boring game exist?  









 Yup, Google stopped letting other apps like GrooveIP use their voice numbers for wifi calls. Which means you have to have Hangouts. Which means older phones can no longer make wifi calls from their Voice numbers that they've had and used for years over wifi.  
Sucks. 




 Wait, that isn't a joke pic? 




 I've always heard the word "duvet" but for whatever reason never had the occasion to learn what it was, or the curiosity to find out. So it's just a blanket you can put different coverings on to change the look of it? It's purpose is to save money by owning one blanket with multiple coverings instead of owning multiple blankets? Or is the main reason for having one the ease of cleaning it? I'm assuming both. 




 And onions. I've never seen this without yellow onion rings as well. 




 What, all at once? 




 Whelp, with my prime membership I'll have my Joy Bidet C-1 (I chose a different model after reading reviews for a bit) on Saturday. I had no idea these types of bidets ever existed. 




 Apples and oranges. I would consider sand castles as art because you're molding and sculpting. This is really just squirting colors in and getting random results. You could say that paint splatters on a canvas is art, but that would only be worth anything (if it is) because of the name of the artist, not because of the result. Kinda like  a cd of Beyonce screaming random words for an hour. Abstract, perhaps, but worthless standing on it's own merit.  




 So now I know that kids think 30's and 40's is old. 




 The radio stations do it, too. It's weird when you listen to lots of radio, then hear the same songs from a different source. They sound slow as hell. 




 You can always just uninstall the keyboard you don't like. 




 Congratulations, you are the first person on reddit I hate.  
So here's an upvote, I guess. 




 AT T and T-Mobile GSM phones use a SIM card. Verizon CMDA phones can't have the SIM slot, so those phones are limited to pretty old models on 3G only. I'm using my old Droid X2, and from what I've gathered it's probably the best Verizon phone you can use.  
Now, I've heard more than once that some folks can get 4G Verizon phones to work, but every discussion I've had with someone from Straight Talk says otherwise.

edit: Talking Android BYOP here. 




 Well, the softer the material, the easier the drilling mostly. Fine silt that's highly micaceous though puffs up to the point where it seems like twice as much comes up out of the ground that what there should be. When you have to shovel spoils out of your way, it's a bit tiring. Running sands are probably the trickiest. Sand can have so much water in it that it flows. When you're drilling with hollow stem augers, it wants to flow up into them. Took a lot of headaches to figure out how to drill that. When I'm coring rock, I think limestone is the easiest. It pinnacles, so you can go in and out of it as you go down and you have to exercise extreme caution, but when coring with wireline I have the barrel spinning as fast as it can go, and can hear the rock sing. Excellent moneymaker there.  
But the easiest drilling is moist coarse silt. It isn't packed too hard in the ground, it's so soft I can almost push augers into it, and backfilling is quick and easy.

 Ugh, that gamey, liver-like taste. Can't get past it. 




 You have no idea. Soil is so extremely varied, that different professions have different ways to classify it. Drillers tend to follow the examples of the geologists and engineers they're drilling for. 




 On a flight that was stuck on the tarmac for a couple hours I found that they let you listen in on one of the radio frequencies on the headphones. Dulles was packed with planes, and everyone was held up everywhere. This controller I was listening to was amazing. He was talking to god-knows how many pilots and just rattling off instructions for a half-hour straight. It was art. He finally said he was done, and a crap-ton of pilots were giving him praises and thanks. I couldn't even imagine trying to wrap my head around what he was dealing with. 




 A geotechnical driller's perspective...

Very generally speaking, soil, outside of rock, is really just gravel (crushed/weathered rock), sand (crushed/weathered rock and minerals), silt (crushed/weathered minerals) and clay (minerals mixed with organics).  
If you look at the particles of each type, you'll see gravels are much larger than sands, which are much larger than silts, which are much larger than clays, though silt and clay can and often do appear the same. Silt particles are generally roundish, where clay particles are flatter. If you add water to both, the soil will fall apart to nothing, but the clay adheres to itself and becomes sticky.  
Organics/peats are almost always part of the topsoil (the nutrient rich top 15 inches or so of the earth which contains the root systems of the plants in any given area.) Below this you'll really only find more than traceable amounts if there are tree roots or the earth has been disturbed or something like that.  
And then you have loam, which is really just an almost even mixture of sand, silt, and clay.  
That's most of it. What you're walking on and looking at is the topsoil. It can vary greatly, but it's pretty much gravel, sand, silt, or clay, or a mixture in whatever proportion. 




  Why would someone downvote a comment offering a suggestion?

Because Reddit. 




 Yeah, the old ones didn't have the copy protection signal screwing up the copy back then.  




 Kinda true, depends on the settings. I had mine set on the highest quality, and 2 rokus would lag. I run it off a nice gaming tower.
