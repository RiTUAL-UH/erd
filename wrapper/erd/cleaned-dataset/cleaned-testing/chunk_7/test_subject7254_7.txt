 This is what happens when you bring murder charges against police officers for political reasons. 









 Except society isn't all in one boat together.  Everyone has the freedom to make their own boat, no matter how big or small.  Or swim if they want to. 




 Ahh the Democrat Party's favorite word: **free** 




 More intellectual midgetry.  You can't refute the content, so you attack the source. 









 Pee sitting down. 




 But let's get back to those horrible Christians.  /s 




 Obama has been 'cleaning up someone else's mess' for the last 7 years?

World War 2 was won by the Allied forces in less time.

How many years until Obama is responsible for the forces under his command?  




 The left is conveniently forgetting that Hillary Clinton supported the Iraq war 100%. 




 If the left really cared about US troops dying in combat they would be critiquing the current President.

75% of all casualities and **92%** of Marine casualties in Afghanistan have been under Barack Hussein Obama. 




 You only had to go back 70+ years to find an iota of evidence supporting your anti-white racism? 









 The idealogues of Reddit who drink the honey of capitalism yet deride it have no interest in hearing accounts of those who have actually lived in a controlled, socialist environment. 




 Democrat tactics to undermine American institutions and gain power are working. 

Democrats want only one entity to have power: The Federal Government.

Just listen to the daily Reddit clamor for more subservience. 




 Everything was surprisingly realistic until this. 














 In 2009 Iraq was more peaceful than Baltimore. 









 He's also the Republican pick by the Democrats.

The left cannot beat a truly conservative candidate.  The media knows this so they push middle of the road softies. 




 Do you care to read the article and provide anything meaningful? 









 But...it was a video!! /s 









 Savage animal slashes and burns a 10 year old boy to death in his bed after killing his family.

#WhiteLivesMatter 









 The most disciplined and regulated department of the federal branch is rife with waste and bureaucracy.

HHS will be 10x worse. 




 Democrat Motto: "Make someone else pay for it."  




 Why in God's name would this be down voted?  He is making a stand.
Are the pro-Hillary algorithms in place already? 









 Great idea! Let's ban opposing viewpoints!

More Stalinism from the oh so intelligent Reddit left. 




 What an amazing analysis with world-class geopolitical insight!

Hundreds of Redditors are on the edge of their seats, waiting for further words from your lips. 














 Can't refute the content so you attack the source.

Weak. 




 But....it was a video!!    /s 




 You have a lot to learn in life.  Good luck to you. 




 Not **one** out of 19,000?

This is still your belief after officials in Philly have been caught committing vote fraud? 




 In case you forgot, Obama received 100% of the votes in 59 Philly districts. 









 In America money can be earned through hard work.  
You have obviously never done this. 




 Why did some random mining company in Russia donate $1 million to the Clinton Foundation?

The State Dept. granted uranium rights in Wyoming to that exact same company.

Draw your own conclusions. 




 The law doesn't apply to Queen Hillary. 




 Can anyone tell me why a random mining company in Russia would give $1 Million to the Clinton Foundation? 




 "No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State."

Edit: TIL Hillary supporters will downvote the raw text of the Constitution. 









 No one cares. 




 Curt, no one cares. 




 Still blaming things on Bush and Reagan after seven years of Obama being in the Whitehouse?

 




 The same way you save the dodo.  

You don't.  Go worry about something else. 




 The Patriot Act requires a warrant.  What is happening now is far beyond what is law. 




 The state-loving Obamabots will take their Dear Leader over the Constitution any day. 









 Yes, our people in Benghazi were delivering weapons to Obama's freedom fighters in Syria.

Sending American TOW Missiles to terrorists?  Yes we can!

 I've gone to all black schools and lived in all black neighborhoods.

You? 




 Please name the inner city private Catholic school where your classroom is out of control. 




 I highly doubt it. 




 Aren't government-run schools great? 




  I think this would be a wonderful opportunity to pause for a moment and give thanks for the many great contributions of the Democratic-voting black community and their culture to our society.

Their peaceful and generous nature make them ideal neighbors, lending testimony to their exceptional family values and parenting skills unrivaled by any other culture.
Their commitment to academic excellence enriches our schools and serves as an example to all who hope to achieve prominence as a people.

Real estate values are fueled by the influx of African Americans into an area due to their caring and respectful nurturing of these communities, an example of all they have achieved by their enthusiasm for self improvement through hard work and a self-reliant can-do nature.

Without their industrious and creative drive, we would be poorer as a nationpresently enriching the cities of Spokane WA, Chicago IL, Philadelphia PA, Washington D.C., St. Louis MO, New Orleans LA, Los Angeles CA, Flint MI, Baltimore MD, Pontiac MI, Newark NJ, Cleveland OH, Atlanta GA, Richmond VA, Memphis TN, Birmingham AL, Camden NJ; and lets not forget Detroit, MI, the tourism capital of the world!

 Another day of intolerance from the left.

Silence and destroy those they disagree with. 









 Brave of you to admit that, but kids are going to do what you do, not what you say. 




 "America favors the rich."

Biggest lie of the decade, meant to divide us and destroy our republic. 




 Israelis deserve to not have their neighborhoods rocketed.

Israeli should yield nothing, because it will not stop the terrorism.  

The intolerant Palestinians won't stop until Israel doesn't exist.

 









 George Zimmerman was "white Hispanic".

She's "white ethnic". 




 I am a scientist and absolutely do not believe people are causing the earth to warm. 




 Now the petulant boy king wants to control the press.  









 Sure, Democrats save the crippled puppies and Republicans kick old people down a flight of stairs.

"Today's heresy is tomorrow's orthodoxy."

As half or /r/politics Redditors will be conservatives when you gain more life experience, this saying rings true.  Think about this whenever someone of conservative persuasion is shouted down, ridiculed and mocked on this sub.

Always question the mob.
