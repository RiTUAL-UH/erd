 Liechtenstein thanks you for your support. 




 Wait, wait, wait, wait. You are putting a "police force" in my borders without my permission... And this *isn't* a declaration of war? 




 Currently, Liechtenstein is in a state of war, but as soon as the conflict ends, we would gladly sell you equipment. 




 Yep. I'll have my wiki updated by the end of the day. 




 Liechtenstein is asking the EMU for help/intervention since this declaration of war by Poland, another EMU member, is unjust. Tuva ceded Kaliningrad to Liechtenstein fairly. If Poland had indeed been in negotiations with both the former NSF and Tuva (which Liechtenstein was unaware of) they obviously saw the nation as unfit to lead the territory and chose not to cede it to them or else they would already have it. Liechtenstein tried to make agreements with Poland upon hearing about their interest in Kaliningrad and they took the first deal. I request that Poland be removed from the EMU and other member nations help Liechtenstein in this conflict.

[meta] And let's be realistic. I have one of the smallest countries in Europe. I really can't win this on my own. He has at least two people blindly following him without question. 




 [meta] Actually, Sealand got claimed around a week after I annexed it. I think the claimer is inactive, but i never re-annexed it, so I only have Kaliningrad. Sorry I haven't updated my wiki. I have to research a little more on my military now since its grown a lot with Kaliningrad and I have work in an hour.

Edit: in fact, I just checked the unclaimed countries list and Sealand is on it.  




 And the acid rain. 




 As leader of Liechtenstein, I am taking this moment to formally announce the conclusion of negotiations for the joining together of our two regions! Kaliningrad will remain the name of the Capitol, but the exclave itself will be Knigsberg. In recent years, the economy and population of Knigsberg have been falling, but Liechtenstein is hoping to boost its economy by making it Liechtenstein's center for overseas trade. On top of that, we will also be taking advantage of its amber deposits, fishing, boat, and auto industry, and tourism to boost the economy as well.

Liechtenstein has also made a deal with Poland to insure safe passage of goods to and from our ports in exchange for a percentage of goods that enter and leave the area. 




 I guess I'm just thinking in US terms. There are so many more automatic cars in the US, even older ones. 




 Maybe because they're making more cars automatic or with paddle shifters?  




 We understand and thank you! 




 Liechtenstein would like to invest in the hologram projects. We feel this is a great step forward in communication technology and would like to see it become the norm. 




 Liechtenstein would like to negotiate the annexation of Kaliningrad Oblast since it is an exclave and not connected to the main land of Russia.

Its name will most likely become the previous name of its capital, Knigsberg while the capital will remain Kaliningrad. 

Its population sits at just over 940,000 at the moment and its GDP is about US$14,000 per capita. Unfortunately, both have been falling. Liechtenstein hopes to reverse this buy boosting investors and helping with overall quality of life.

The population is currently 86% Russian with the rest being made up of various Eastern European demographics. 

We hope to make use of its ice-less ports and make it Liechtenstein's center for sea trade. We also hope to utilize its tourism, amber deposits, fishing industry, and boat and auto manufacturing to continue to boost its own economy and help our own. 




 The Kaiser gladly accepts the Freefold's huggies. 




 Liechtenstein is formally offering SHIT squads and other aid to all affected countries that request it and is joining in the search to end this terrible group.

Anyone who needs assistance need only ask.

Edit: I misspelled my title and am sad. 




 Liechtenstein is willing to send SHIT squads to all who request it. 




 Yeah, I'm struggling for ideas as well. 




 They'll arrive ready for operations in approximately one month. 




 Liechtenstein and France jointly developed an off-road reconnaissance and transport vehicle, the AT-23 Spectre.  (http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/25mxbk/event_liechtenstein_and_france_reveal_at23/).  The base price is US$600,000 per vehicle and they will arrive ready for use. 




 Hey, now. Don't start this. 




 Despite all efforts put into monthly searches for Bogeymen, we have come up with nothing.  This is a sad failure on my own part and I apologize.  However, simply finding nothing does not disprove the existence of the Bogeyman.  He is a wily beast and Liechtenstein will immediately begin researching new ways to catch him as our previous ways are archaic and outdated.  Do not worry, citizens, this beast will be caught. 




 The aircraft will take off and land vertically, but the rotors will be able to turn to allow the aircraft to maneuver and move quickly.  When the rotors have been turned a full 90 degrees the aircraft is predicted to be able to reach speeds of over 100 knots, however, the horizontal speed isn't the main goal. The main goal is to have a veihicle that can hover and provide air support and recon in combat zones and be able to arrive and leave the combat zone quickly along with being stealthier than current VTOLs (Sort of a get in, get out type vehicle). The aircraft will be piloted by two men and be armed with a 20 mm Gatling gun at the nose and hold eight MIRV-style rockets for anti-armor and building attacks. More information will be released as research continues. So far the research is expected to take between eighteen months and two years. 









 We can only hope. 




 All beds are to be overturned quickly in attempts to surprise the Bogeymen and all closets are to be prodded around in with a stick or stick-like object. When asked about this strange mandate, Hchste Kaiser would only explain that he was afraid and that this menace needed to be stopped. This procedure is to be performed on the 2nd of every month beginning next year. 




 I'm here and I'll be trying to be more active than the past few weeks. 




 Not much has happened in the past year. Our great leader's only public declaration was to make vaccines mandatory for all citizens. However, he has promised to be a much more active leader in the coming years.  




 Liechtenstein would like 10,000 for US$800 million. 




 Sorry, guys. Not her.

 The Hchste Kaiser was unavailable when this was posted.

~Signed Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429 




 We understand. We'd still be happy to provide a donation to speed research up. This is a technology that we're very interested in. 




 [meta] Haha! [/meta] 




 From here and onward, all citizens of Liechtenstein are required to receive  vaccines. Those who refuse will be quarantined until they agree to be vaccinated. People wishing to immigrate to Liechtenstein are now required to show proof of vaccination. If they have not been vaccinated, they will be given one week to be vaccinated or risk deportation. 




 Liechtenstein would love to help finance and research this project in exchange for rights to continue research and manufacture upon the project's completion. We're prepared to offer US$10 billion and a team of researchers. This combined with Liechtenstein's current personnel armor would be a great step in military advancement. 




 Welcome back, man! 




 Liechtenstein: Present

**Resolution #0004:** Nay

**Membership:** Aye 




 Liechtenstein and France are proud to announce the completion of their newest advancement in military technology! After some setbacks, the fully customizable Titan Infantry Armor is being mass produced and used by France and Liechtenstein and is for sale for approximately US$5,000 per suit.

Quick description: The armor is made of a weave of spectra fiber and Kevlar, is made up of paintable panels on a suit that can be added or removed for added mobility/protection, and the armor is fully customizable to the wearer's ability. The second part of the armor is the helmet. It is made of the same materials, covers the entire head, features an HUD that displays location, weapon, and other information, an eye piece with zooming, night vision, and other abilities, and can be fitted with a gas mask and oxygen supply.

Once again, each suit is also available for export to any country under any specification and will arrive combat-ready for US$5,000 or more depending on specs.

 France said he'd be a little inactive this week. That's probably why you haven't seen him much. 




 Sweet 




 Sorry I've been so inactive. I should be able to start posting regularly again within the week. 




 I get it. I completely agree. 




 Is that partly because of Beartooth's last few tours? Because the last two times I saw them they were with ABR and BTF, and then MMF. 




 Liechtenstein relinquishes power to you.

Meta: I didn't see this yesterday. Welcome to the game :) 




 I'm still here. 




 YEESSSS 




 [Meta] Hah, it's no problem. [/meta]  




 We apologize for the inconvenience. If we ever decide to dominate the Earth and more space becomes available, we'll inform you first. 




 Considering that's over 800% of our population, I'm not entirely sure of that's possible. 




 O ja 




 It's good to be back. However, the influx of new people makes me nervous. 




 Over 6 years ago, due to threats to the nation and the world, Hchste Kaiser closed the country's borders and only allowed those on important business to enter, and even then, only after extensive security precautions were taken. Today, though, the great leader of Liechtenstein reopened the borders for public travel and immigration! Hchste Kaiser was asked what made him finally decide to reopen and was quoted saying, "I forgot to open them after a few months..." 

Well, today anyone with a passport may now enter Liechtenstein for whatever reason they please, be it the scenery, our famous jam covered women, or simply to worship our wonderful leader!

**Disclaimer:** Not all women in Liechtenstein are covered in jam. 









 Everyone is job in Liechtenstein. 




 ~ Signed, Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein /u/test_subject7429 




 Alright, I'll admit I was wrong in the way I reacted. 




 I didn't say I didn't know. 




 I was upset because he wasn't backing it up, he just denied what the others were saying. Not because I wanted to actually know. 




 There. That's all I wanted. You're right. Thank you. 




 I did? 




 Why don't you actually back it up instead of arguing the same way my 12 year old brother does? 




 You can put your flair on yourself in the sidebar. Just so people know your title and what country you represent. 




 Liechtenstein's 6+ year effort, the former subway station turned bunker is finally complete! This bunker is, for now, to be used for research and storage of government rations, weapons, vehicles, etc., but its true purpose is in fact a shelter in the event of a nuclear holocaust/meteor strike/other threat to all life on earth. Due to Liechtenstein's small population, the bunker is equipped to sustain a good portion of Liechtenstein's citizens for years. 

Guarded by a large blast-proof gate, it is equipped with living quarters, water purifiers, air filters, environment suits, research and medical facilities, a command center, and more. Despite Liechtenstein's readiness, we truly hope that this bunker's true purpose is never actually needed. The bunker is also equipped with office space and storage facilities for Mann Co. Liechtenstein will always be willing to expand the bunker to make space for any country that is willing to pay and aide in the development. 

The bunker is also home to a large meeting room and living quarters to allow for lengthy meetings between multiple world leaders to discuss business in a much safer and more private setting. 




 What about Liam Neeson simply as Dad 




 I couldn't stop laughing when he started talking. 




 Perfect. 




 If you help fund, we would be willing to send you part of the first batch of suits when they're finished. 




 Liechtenstein has been working on a bunker for years. We may be willing to negotiate expanding to allow for a small amount of space for Mann Co. 




 Liechtenstein and France have begun planning a new type of lightweight armor for military personnel. The armor will be made of a light plating sections attached to a suit. The material being used is a weave of spectra fiber and Kevlar. The plates will be separated along the suit to allow for easy mobility, but it'll be possible to add plates for situations where less mobility and more armor are necessary.  If this is successful, the armor ahould be able to resist a moderate amount of small arms fire and withstand anything less. The plates will also be camouflaged to allow for tactical use in any environment. The armor itself will be able to be upgraded and customized as the wearer sees fit.

Along with the suit, we will also be developing a helmet made of the same materials that covers the entire head and face of the soldier. These helmets will be fitted with a radio, a heads up display displaying information on the location (elevation, coordinates, temperature, etc.), an eye piece that allows for night vision, thermal, telescopic, etc., and in some cases, the helmets will be fitted with an oxygen supply. More information will be released if more research is deemed necessary.

This research is expected to take, if all goes according to plan, around 18 months.

As usual, this technology will be available for export upon completion and beginning of mass production.

Edit: some more stuff 




 We forgive you. 




 DO NOT QUESTION THE MOTIVES OF LIECHTENSTEIN! 




 Liechtenstein requests that this rail system goes through our nation. We are prepared to offer labor in return. 




 Liechtenstein's delegates have succeeded in negotiating the annexation of the micro nation known as Sealand. For the time being, Sealand will serve as an Atlantic watch post, small boat rest area, and marine study facility until future plans are complete. 




 Establishing a better relationship with our close neighbors is definitely in Liechtenstein's best interests. We will consider this. 




 Liechtenstein feels that a more permanent relationship between itself and France would definitely be beneficial. Especially after already experiencing working with France. 




 Liechtenstein is looking for a more permanent partner (or partners) to continue helping with military equipment research. This would also open a permanent free trade agreement between Liechtenstein and the country in question and Liechtenstein promises to help that country in its own endeavors. The first project will most likely be Light Personell Armor. 




 ~Signed, Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429 




 Hchste Kaiser is happy to attend 




 You're not alone. That movie is the shit. 




 As we said before, Liechtenstein fears no one. However, this expansion isn't militaristic. At least not at this moment. 




 Liechtenstein fears no one. 




 Liechtenstein has sent a diplomat to the teeny tiny nation of Sealand to discuss joining together our two great nations.  




 We'll send all available workers to aide in the construction immediately. 




 Liechtenstein could help you in planning and building this barrier. We have a lot of experience in wall building. 




 It's the Great North Land I think. 




 Though I fully trust my citizens, I agree. BACKGROUND CHECKS: REAPPLIED! 




 Liechtenstein is a fully militarized country. All citizens are trained soldiers and I trust them to the fullest. 




 [Meta] I'm pretty sure news posts aren't to be used unless its Sunday. 




 Hchste Kaiser has hereby made all firearms legal to privately own. Citizens no longer need background checks or any form of identification to own different types of firearms. All firearms minus government weaponry are now available to the public. Hchste Kaiser has also proclaimed April 12th to be national Go Shoot Things Day. All citizens are required by law to participate in this holiday. All of these rules have been implemented in the newly passed You Get a Gun, You Get a Gun, Everyone Gets a Gun! Act of 2023.

Edit: HCHSTE KAISER RETRACTS THE NO BACKGROUND CHECKS PART 




 I'm active! 




 Thanks!
