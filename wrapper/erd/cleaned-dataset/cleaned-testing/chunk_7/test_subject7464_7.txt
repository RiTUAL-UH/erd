 I work in HR (maybe it's because of my job nature but I am really enjoying reading everyone's responses here, so felt like I had to jump in to say something)

The good: when my staff are happy, are committed to the job and perform well, especially those that I've personally recruited. It's immensely satisfying! I brought in one staff who had a splotchy resume filled with career gaps, earning quite low for his age   qualifications...but we gave him a chance and now he's excelling in his job, has a bright future with the company and progression in his career to look forward to. 

The bad: when my staff aren't happy in their jobs, for whatever reason. Cliched, but true. Mostly, the reasons people are unhappy are beyond the HR function's capacity, but some staff seem to think that HR should be able to magically solve all their issues for them....quite often it's due to horrible bosses and I secretly think many of the management level staff in my company are incompetent.
