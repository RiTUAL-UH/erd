 Not yet. I plan on working on one and have it out by the end of July. I need the money (poor college student with minimum wage job), but it will be on the Apple Bookstore.  




 Hey Redditors! Just started writing a new story set in a new setting. It's set in a alternative version of 14 century Europe, where America is being colonized. Some people are born with a gift- the ability to become one animal at will. However, they keep their ability hidden due to the Inquisition happening at the time. Dinosaurs are also alive in this universe, and are used as beasts of burden and pets, (yes, T-Rexes can be sweet pookies too). That's all I have for now, please feel free to ask questions! 




 Alternate 14th century Europe and is suddenly a epicenter for magic and creatures of myth. 




 I have a feeling this little one will be safe. 




 I want to have mythical creatures as characters. Like a griffin or chimera be able to use magic to become human to blend in. Dijin, fauns, dryads and other beings that can't look human can do this too. 




 Hey Redditors,

I'm working on a new series about wizards, sorcerers and mythical creatures in the modern day Big Easy and I've come across a problem. Most urban fantasy stories nowdays have some sort of 'hub', school, summer camp or institution set up for the fantastic in the setting. Any ideas on what I can do to make the idea of a 'hub' interesting? 




 Solids- Ores, patches of dirt that have odd properties, extreme mutagentic abilties that won't kill the affected being. 
Liquids- Ooze found underground and floating in water around lakes and oceans.
Gas- Found in caves primarily.  
 




 Hey Redditors! Whilst in vaction, I thought of a new idea for a hard fantasy series. It takes place in a fictional world named Crerth, where magic can be studied like science. Mages and wizards don't exist and magic is physically present in various states of matter. For hundreds of years the states of magic were studied and applied in various conservatories across the world. The researchers messed up on an blacklisted experiment to open a gateway into a world where magic naturally existed. This explosion of raw magic not only infused part of the population with magical properties, it also sent magical creatures like Grpyphons, dragons and various other monsters into Crerth. The story takes place fifty years after the accident, and revolves around an orphan boy who has magically enhanced senses. Not sure where to go, but I kinda like the idea. Any help would be appreciated!    




 Hey Redditors,

I've been working on a new world for superhero fiction and I need some help. I've been working on a Arrow-type archer named Quiver, a hero with no powers. I want to introduce powers and magic, but I'm not sure how I can do it. Should it be like a particle accelerator explosion like in the Flash tv show? 




 A Gifted's power is random. In rare cases, a two Gifted parents might have a child with both powers, but the chances are incredibly rare, like albino rare. Pooka's do need training to fluidly change into their animal form, but after about a year of training they can change without a problem. There is a myth that Pookas powers come from the God of the Hunt, Kartan, but in reality no one knows why they can change.   




 In Pantaria, sex and gender isn't a major issue, unless it's between a witch and a wizard. If that happens, a reality warper (sorcerer) is born and that isn't good.  Hetero and Homosexual pairings are the norm and bisexuality is applied to almost everyone. Contraceptives are mundane condoms, but inventive mages have created novelty types that enhance pleasure or can literally make sparks fly between the couple (yes, test subjects have died testing that last one). Sex can effect politics, especially when it's around election day. Marriage is a special affair that is celebrated with the throwing of 'glitter rice' and shredded Cunsack, a special fish at the peneical of festivities.  




 Thanks for the input! Any ideas or questions about the world? I need all the help I can get.

 Is the game Scion an option? 




 Please Lewis, play Scion! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scion_(role-playing_game) 




 I like that. It's easy to produce and should be easy to cast spells while wearing it. Any ideas on species of dragons? I know we plan on having a feathered species and possibly and aquatic species, but we need more input. 




 Nice! You think it might be unisex? We've got female riders too. 




 It's Medieval fantasy. Plate armour isn't viable because of the weight. I meant along the lines of uniforms, like the clothes that Riders wear outside of battle when on patrol or during missions.  




 We have plans for a sequal series, so the possibility of a series for kids isn't off the table. Since your interested, any ideas on Rider uniforms? 




 It's more aimed at older audiences, as sex, booze and blood are shown. We're either going to make it a graphic novel series or a book series, we're undecided.   




 It's an action/adventure series about three adopted brothers who are raised by a veteran Rider and use their powers to combat threats in a rapidly changing world. They deal with magicly enhanced super soldiers, demons, anarchists and a hyper intelligent dragon who hates humanoid races. 




 Nice, I like that idea. It's like a flamethrower that needs to be recharged. 




 He overthinks things and at the start, he doesn't feel like he's confident to face his foes on his own. He has an intense love of learning and literature, leading to him eventually becoming a Librarian in the Library of Reality(think L-Space from Discworld). He sees the book theft as his fault because he was too outgoing with a girl at the counter to notice it was stolen. 




 Like Team Arrow or Flash. I like it. Any suggestions on teammates abilities? 




 He doesn't get superpowers, but relies on his wits and magic items to fight. In terms of personality, he's quite and has social anxiety disorder. He's not really a fighter, but his parents bookshop needs that book back, so he puts aside his fear and forms the second identity to find it.  




 He goes in search of the book. By superhero, I mean he puts on a costume and  




 Hey Redditors,

I've been working on a new character to add to my shared world of Pantaria. He's the child of two bookshop owners who becomes a 'superhero' when a rare magical book is stolen by a guild of mysterious thieves. I need everyone's help because I don't know if he should have any powers, a team or what kind of gear he should use; aside from a gliding cloak. 

Thanks!  




 Hugh Jackman. I can say I spent time with Wolverine! 




 The snow nymph? Interesting. Any resentment you have towards her has to be let go. 




 Nailed it. The intercourse would happen between the Doritos crumbs and the sticky Mountain Dew patch on the couch. Sexy.  




 There's the Greek goddess Aergia, the goddess of inactivity who guards Hypnoses court.  




 I meant, if you were the kid of any god or godess, but based on your parent (mom or dad), what god would you be the kid of? 




 Hey Redditors,

Today's question. If you were a demigod, from any pantheon, but based on what attracted the god/godess to your human parent, what would you be and why?
