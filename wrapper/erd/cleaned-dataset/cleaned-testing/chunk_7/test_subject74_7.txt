 These are absolutely gorgeous, the level of contrast between the colorful patterns and the black calligraphy. It's just beautiful, the flow of along with the contrast makes them really pop! Is there any inspiration references between the collab or similarities/inspiration in the artists' previous works? 




 It looks as though you've elongated the fingers too much and made the palm of the hand too small it should really be a bit bigger and maybe even extend past the wrist slightly...I could give a better critique if the original photo was also included for reference. 


Also, consider blending the color of the hand's skin tone with the rest of the person's skin tone...Having it all lighter makes it look a bit superimposed... 




 Hey, thanks! I looked on kijiji and managed to not find these. Haha. Thanks! :) 




 I'm located in Halifax, Canada. And I'm looking for someone to dread or help me dread my hair...I have fine hair, naturally pretty straight.


But, I've been residue free for the past 8 months or so...Maybe even longer, I use Knotty Boy and Dollylocks bar shampoos. So, my hair shouldn't be too difficult to dread and I am hoping to use the back combing method and palm rolling. 




 Synthetics can be real hair and can be braided in not glued... 




 Thank you, wishing you a speedy recovery as well!!  




 I did it, and I'm very glad I did... Despite how I'm feeling right now and yesterday... My doctor found two spots of endo. I officially have a diagnosis and some relieve. 
One of the spots was quite deep on the right side. 


Also for anyone who can help it's random but how do you check a merina? I have no idea and can't bend enough to get one currently.  




 Thanks so much for the recommendations! :)  




 It's not the first show to keep the awful parts, I'm not saying its a good thing but shows have been way worse about the exact same issue...And if it was all rainbows and butterflies in these people's lives it wouldn't be worth watching...And the male characters have struggles too...One of the male characters is a closeted homosexual and they show realistic issues about that too...It's not like writers are out to get women. It's not every 3 minutes and in some of the cultures depicted in the show its a really relevant issue...Such as in Korea where Sun the business woman is located...And in the second episode she kicks major ass and continues to in the entire season and even prevails over the assumptions made about her because she is a woman in Korea


Honestly the female characters in this show end up being the most important characters in it. But again, if you want to judge it on the first episode and completely condemn it because its realistic in a way you don't like then by all means.  




 The thing is though...if you think about it the show is realistic in this sense...Women in the world do struggle with that kind of thing, how is it lazy writing to show those issues and then show the very same characters thriving and empowered...I think if you didn't judge the show so harshly in the first episode and gave it a real chance you wouldn't feel this way.


I get that feminism is important and as a woman especially but its a show and its a show that's realistic to how the world is. Especially when it comes to trans women. The issues its depicting here are actually why we need feminism and its not really encouraging the behaviours its depicting...But obviously you're a logical person and you get that...

For example Dexter is about a serial killer but its not telling people they should go out and do that but it gives a realistic depiction of that scenario in most cases... 




 Thank you so much! These look like awesome suggestions! :)  




 Reasonably priced, so probably under 20 to 30... I am currently using all drug store brands except my brow pencil is laura mercier...I'd prefer not to pay $58 for one thing...


But, I mostly just want recommendations of what's good and what works for others 




 Okay, so can someone that is good at make up help me pick out brushes, and good quality make up... I still don't want to go full on glam but right now I'm a noob that only knows how to do brows and basic things like eye shadow. 


Also advice on contouring would be appreciated as well but subtle is best







Edit: my eyes are hazel, my skin tone is pale/milky white, my hair is a light copper color, my brows are light like my hair, and my price range is reasonable...I can't afford to pay $200 to have a a starting amount of make up...
And I do actually have a bit like brow pencil, blush, white shadow, mascara, and one foundation brush...I have foundation but it needs work...I do like to combine liquid(bb cream) and powder foundations. 




 Thank you so much for replying, I will definitely treat myself beforehand...Tuesday is coming so fast I can't believe it.

I've arranged for my boyfriend to look after me afterwards so I'm pretty fortunate to know I won't have to do too much with a week off...But, it was still a worry for sure...

Its good to hear the drugging happens quickly, I'm going to be a ball of nerves at the hospital. But, I definitely realize that you're right...My pain is too bad to prolong this and getting a diagnosis is worth it.

I'm so glad to have gotten supportive and encouraging feedback, it means so much to me.  




 hahaha why in the hell are you looking at this sub then? Don't be a dick bud. 









 Thank you! I'll likely update this post once its done 




 I really really appreciate your input...Your experience makes me feel a lot better...Especially to hear about the energy 3 weeks in because I've been exhausted for the past year and a half since my pain got really bad...It was always there but has intensified to almost constant...


Its even better to hear good things about the Mirena because I'm supposed to be getting one and I already picked it up and that was another source of anxiety for me. 

I'm very thankful that you commented on my post, thank you so so much. It means a lot to hear so much insight. 




 My first lap is this coming Tuesday and I'm really really scared about it. I've cried. I've worried. I've become terrified based on what others have said...

I just really need to hear words of why it was worth it, and positive experiences...I get that its surgery and its going to hurt. I basically just need some comfort from people who can understand my situation. 




 Thank you so much for the response, I called and the lady told me this possibility and then said she couldn't promise anything and hung up on me so this is reassuring.
