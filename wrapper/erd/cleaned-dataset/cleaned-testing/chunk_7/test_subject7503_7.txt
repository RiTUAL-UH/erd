 School officials wont comment on this case, but say that police in schools are crucial to providing a safe atmosphere and protecting against outside threats.

Picking up a kid, slamming him down, cuffing him, and then filing charges all for kicking a trash can is not a safe atmosphere. Seems that a threat to the kids body and future is already there.

 Said it before and I will say it again. 

Good. Public servants should be known to the public, especially when they murder someone of the public.  




 She should get a door stopper.  




 Gmilf. CONFIRMED.  




 Until we overturn citizens united/make this type of shit illegal or off the Koch brothers nothing will change. The United states government is not a democracy anymore its more of a bidding war for rich fucks to become more of a rich fuck. 




 I know exactly why I have this erection.  




 You can not be serious. 




 Congrats police of Pasadena. 

Thank you for spending our tax money on all those resources for a raid on a lab that runs tests on marijuana. Thank god for these officers for doing everything they can to stop those evil scientist from running test on that horrible devil's lettuce. 

Thank God for these heros and the war on drugs.

 I want everyone to stop right now and look at the tag on their clothing. 

If that tag says you are wearing more than type of fabric, you are sinning and openly defying the word of God and for it you will be sent into endless hellfire.

 What the fuck is wrong with these people? Better yet what kind of institution caves and gives into this safe space bullshit? 

As far as I can tell its nothing but a bunch of privileged white people (who feel bad about being privileged and white) bitching and throwing bitch fits over shit that doesn't matter.

 Good. Public Servants should be known to the public when they murder someone of the public.  




 It's pretty simple.

1. Find a fuck.
2. Start suckin. 
3. ???
4. Profit. 




 I hope you get buried in a mountain of dicks and have to eat your way to freedom.

 Hope it gets into their eyes and dicks. 




 YALL MOTHERFUCKAS THINK THIS IS A GAME WOOF WOOF

 Plot-twist. OP gave her the peenie weenie.  




 So if she was arrested for resisting arrest then that means the cop arrested her before he even stopped her. And as far I know cops dont normally arrest people for speeding unless it is causing danger to the public.

 SODOMITE SUPPRESSION ACT 

Penal Code section 39 

a) The abominable crime against nature known as buggery, called also sodomy, is a monstrous evil that Almighty God, giver of freedom and liberty, 
commands us to suppress on pain of our utter destruction even as he overthrew Sodom and Gomorrha.

b) Seeing that it is better that offenders should die rather than that 
all of us should be killed by God's just wrath against us for the folly 
of tolerating-wickedness in our midst, the People of California wisely 
command, in the fear of God, that any person who willingly touches another 
person of the same gender for purposes of sexual gratification be put to 
death by bullets to the head or by any other convenient method.

What in the fuck. Using a book from 2000 years ago to kill people because the book said it is ok, is fucked by any standards. 




 Chairman Rafael Moure-Eraso has been accused by members of Congress of malfeasance, hostility towards his staff and retaliation against whistleblowers.
hostility towards his staff and retaliation against whistleblowers.
retaliation against whistleblowers.

Are you fucking telling me Obama's Administration (which is charging Snowden with some 1917 a Espionage Act shit for whistle blowing) wants to punish someone for punishing whistle blowers?  




 For fucks sake.  




 OP is a bundle of sticks. Confirmed.  




 HAHAHAHHHAAAHAHAHAHAHA.

 Basically the Christan Right and the Koch bros. needed someone to ~~control~~ support.  




 Using stolen US info to give to congress members, so they can vote agenst US interest and instead vote for a foren nations interest.

Seems a bit like treason if you ask me.

 They would probably be able to get you for inducing panic.  




 Ive been sent the report by him and Ive seen the time stamp of when the video was taken, lets just say given what I know of that department (and time travel) I seriously have my doubts about the report. 

I could be mistaken about everything but end of the day im always going to be a bit biased in the favor of my friend. 

And you and I both know I cant answer that. 




 Quick question here.

Would the Obama administration be able to use executive order (or something along those lines) to stop the pictures from getting out? 




 18 felony counts

7 years

That doesn't seem right to me.

 Safe sex.

If you are going too drugs, do them responsibly (it can be done).

Save money.

Never stop asking questions.

Read.

Take care of your body.

Highschool means nothing in the long run.

Stay out of legal trouble.

You will make mistakes and you will fail at times.

Dont be an asshole.

Get to know the older people in your family and learn from them.

Be considerate.

Be humble.

Think of how you want your life to be and work for it. 

Be active.

Be respectful to those who deserve it.

Follow your dreams. 

You can reach your goals.

 I'm living proof. 

Beefcake. 

BEEFCAKE! 




 You are a pretty lucky guy, thats a really nice lookin pussy. 




 So I was down in the womb and I was stabbing the shit outta stuff with moms knife. When out of no where I found Goat's Head so I had to pick it up, Then by some luck I found a Dead Cat in the chest. Needlesss to say after all the excitement I forgot that I had Dead Bird with me. 




 Should of got 39 million. But still glad he is free. 




 Purfect.  




 What in the fuck is wrong with this guy? 

Besides all the money getting thrown at him to say climate change is not real. 




 ITT Cucks. 




 So are the UK's governments going full PC/SJW? And any and all talk about non-white people makes you a racist? The fuck?

 If Jesus owned his mansion I'm pretty sure it would be full of poor/homeless people. Jesus kinda had a thing about helping the poor. 




 I have a feeling that it will go something like this. "After an investigation the DA has decided not to prosecute based on lack of evidence." Or "DA has made a plea deal the officer will be allowed to retire with a full pention and back pay." 




 That's outrageous my ex-girlfriend has been giving away cooch for years. I mean yeah its a little worn, smells kinda funky and its not as nice as that cooch but still. 




 Keep going I believe in you.

 Money  you. 




 Nothing will change until we take away the money used to buy politicans. You can keep taking about climate all you want but the public doesn't mean shit compared to money. 




 Lets go ahead and see who gives him money.

 Because on every question she would have to ask Jonathan what to say. 




 Yes. 




 Continue reading on ITT, I've said my whole thoughts on this. Also I agree with your "Greater Israel" statement completely. 




 Nah im just done with this. You are super pro Netanyahu and to you Israel's government can do no wrong so this whole things is pointless.

Have a nice night. 




 Nice try JIDF. :) 




 I think the real question is why are you so adamantly defending it. Everything Ive said Ive posted a source for, and all you keep throwing at me is hypotheticals and deflections.   




 Oh look it is the old "anti-Semite defense". Even though I said nothing bad about the Jews, and all im doing is criticizing Netanyahu/his government. Im an anti-Semite. 




 You do know Governments the world over have (and still to this day) covered up evidence of their wrong doings right?

According to [this](http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/08/04/gaza-israeli-soldiers-shoot-and-kill-fleeing-civilians), [this](http://levantreport.com/2014/07/21/video-israeli-sniper-attacks-civilians-idf-ordered-to-kill-anything-that-moves/) and [this](http://countercurrentnews.com/2014/08/idf-whistleblower-who-posted-israeli-troops-killed-gaza-civilians-in-revenge-now-under-arrest/) the Israeli military has no problem killing civilians. As for who knows its a sham id go ahead and say most of them.
 




 Yes and yes. 

A ongoing killing spree is easier to do if everyone thinks you are not doing it. 




 To save face. That's it. If he was to drop the big one the international community including the US would have to condemn him. Which would fuck up all his plans. But if he dropped a few leaflets he could say (and did) "Hey we warned them."

Plus that school I linked, he and his military knew well in advance that people where taking shelter in it. Then bombed it anyway and put the spin of "Hamas put weapons in there so its alright."
