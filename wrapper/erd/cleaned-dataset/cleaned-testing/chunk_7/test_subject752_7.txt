 Is it really bashing a news website just to point out writing or grammatical errors any year 9 English student would be rapped over the knuckles for? 




 I'm *not* arguing about their website, I'm not arguing about their content, I'm arguing (or rather pointing out) that the standards of their reporters' headlines has plummeted.

For starters, "missus" is a really colloquial term I would not have thought any decent editor would be happy to present to the public on a national news website. 

The sentence as a whole is something I would expect an 15 year old to write on his Facebook! 

I mean can you look me in the eye and tell me that it doesn't come across as rather childish and unfitting of a national news provider? 




 I could argue I don't "not like" the website. I hate the level of unprofessional journalism. 

They do post done good stuff every now and again, I loved their recent repost of a Washington post article about the birth of the internet for instance. But article titles like the one I highlighted are uncalled for. 














 It's also so damn unprofessional. They do do some good stories every now and again, but Jesus, that's appalling wording announcing a pregnancy from a seriously big news conglomerate.  




 Interesting it doesn't mention the monopoly over our international traffic in the form of the southern cross cable, or is that not a consequential part of our monthly bills? 




 Frustratingly they are also my sole source of local news (The Press) as nzherald and other free news sites simply don't cover the smaller chch stories. 
 









 I like the design, clean. 




 "A better camera" isn't bad. But stock is better. (Gs5) 




 Yes, they carefully used different types of explosions to perform a controlled descent. 

The point of an implosion isn't to remove any material as people seem to think, it's merely a tool (when used correctly) to make it easier to deconstruct the building further. 

From a demolition point if view that implosion was fantastic! 

* minimal dust, 
* no injuries, 
* the building fell in the correct detection. 



















 This after Australia spent $100,000 on [lobbying UNESCO parties to not have it listed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/35kys6/australian_government_lobbying_against_unesco/) Despite coral reefs rapidly disappearing due to acidification and pollution!  









 The police auctions at turners are really good I've been told. Sorry don't know any other details, but Google it?

 To be fair: "we have to compete against cheap supermarket beer, let's look at reducing our prices" said no beer owner ever. 

You're not the first person to suggest bar owners shouldn't charge so fucking much for a drink, to be fair they're utterly the victims of their own demise, uni students etc just can't afford $15 for a 1.3 standard drink Smirnoff or whatever (and that was prequake prices..) So seriously, instead of changing with the times (more low alcohol beer, more food options, cheaper/better priced alcohol) they just whine, and bitch and complain how the world's against them. 

The other argument I get told is "well there wasn't a reduction in bad behavior when the closing times were changed a while back" and it's like you diving kidding me?

You stupid cunts that should have led to a change in behavior before shit got worse. 

Utterly no sympathy. 




 Disappointed he didn't even have a photo...... 









 Itt: everyone looks up their own country.  




 Try using sports mode more often. 
If in doubt, use the flash. 
Always turn on your lights in the room (if indoors)

Your device will default to around 1/33 second (a third of a second) to take the lowest possible iso photograph. Sports mode speeds this up to around half a second, which is better than nothing. 
Source of my info: s4 owner for a year, s5 current owner. 

Both have no OIS (optical image stabilization) which means your hand has to stay dead still for around half a second! So you learn to make to do without it. 

If you legitimately have trouble holding your camera still for a third of a second then I would strongly advise you look at OIS for your next device.  




 Ok was very clever with wording, it "plays" at 2100fps, but you're right, it's very misleading, hell my 100Hz tv fails to accurately insert frames to upscale, I really don't think this would be very accurate.  




 Oh Jesus. What the actual Fuck? Look up ignorant cunt in the dictionary, expect to find most of the commenters on that post. 




 Thanks, not implemented in touchwiz gallery, works in maps but is honestly a but useless, whereas a spiral motion can be indefinite zoom, up and down was shit even on a 5.1" screen.  




 So as the header suggests, what would it need to employ a system wide spiral motion to zoom in and out of everything from websites to documents etc. 

I had this functionality on my Nokia N900, it made one handed usage unlike anything else since. 

This would replace/supplement "pinch to zoom" as that inherently requires 2 hands, which (with today's 5 inch plus devices) is not always possible! 

Anyway, any idea how this could be implemented, or is it a pipe dream to every see it back?  




 What's are the most ridiculous reoccurring questions you have to moderate out?  




 I really would not trust some randoms working at a gas station, especially if they were going to just "pop it into the till" where it would be forgotten about and become beer money when till was counted. All it would take if they forgot to tell the next shift about it, it would have been quickly and easily forgotten. 

This way he turned a forgettable event "oh, didn't that guy hand in 50 bucks last night?" Into "oh that wanker the other day, yeah he took the money"

Ironically this probably helped the staff recall the event, also ensured other shift workers knew about the money and ensure it got back to the old lady.

 Thanks op, hopefully they do get the message. In all seriousness though, what a gc you all were! Good job. 




 Actually screw the store, when I worked for bond and bond head office would totally override us in a complaints situation.

Read up: www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz/for-consumers/law/consumer-guarantees-act

Let them know from the outset what your expectations are, whether it be a new phone, refund or what. You have given then their "chance" to remedy the situation, now it's your turn to say "I want x." 

Follow up, agree on a time frame, ask for the escalation path as to who you should talk to, e.g. 
"if this isn't sorted I a week, please let me know the name of your regional manager or other such person I can escalate this to."

If you get your matter resolved, follow up, thank them for helping you (if they did..).

Do NOT bad them on social media, just keep it offline. If this goes as far as the small claims they will dig dirt on you if they can.

There is plain stupid, then there's just **don't reproduce** stupid. This is the latter. 














 No. As per my comment it's not the media, it's the local residents who aren't waking up to a simple fact they have a severe problem.

However swearing at, and making presumptuous comments at people who aren't blaming the media seem at odds with your angry anti media sentiment. 

As proven time after time this kind of violence needs to addressed by very citizens it affects the most, the sons, daughters, husbands and wives if those murdered need to tackle the problem head on, and bring the crime rate down together. The culture of blaming others needs to stop if they're ever to reach a satisfactory outcome (of a more peaceful crime free neighbourhood). 




 It was a generic statement you arrogant cunt.

 It's all shits and giggles until someone giggles and shits.. 




 Why is that ageist? No benefits for people my age are not means tested, in fact many are stonkingly hard to acquire, and aren't worth it.

For the record, here's the table for the amount of money you get [for being being on the pension](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/nz-superannuation-and-veterans-pension-tables/new-zealand-superannuation-and-veterans-pension-ra.html)

We pay more to our old people than we do to a [single parent](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/main-benefits-rates/sole-parent-support-current.html)

[Or to people looking for a job.](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/main-benefits-rates/jobseeker-support-current.htm)

And if you do work until you're 65, even on a meagre salary you don't get any support at all.

So yes, it's absolutely ageist, we pay our old people regardless of..

* How much they've worked,
* How little they've worked, 
* Whether they're still working, 
* How much money they own or have in the bank, 
* What assets they have, 
* How many dependents they have..
* Whether they're in the country
*Or ANY of the prerequisites required of the younger generations.

So yes, applying no rules for 1 age bracket, and every rule under the sun for every other age bracket is extremely ageist. 









 That's fucked up, 1 "white on black" killing everyone is up in arms. 211/216 people killed were black, fucking no-one says anything. 

Fuck, how does anyone do anything in that backwards fucking town if they all walk around with their eyes closed?  




 Honestly, I'm not going to get a pension until I'm 80 (seriously if ever at all), and I can't even apply for a cheap doctors visit due to the government means testing everything for anyone my age, so really not the best person to ask. 

As I said, Fuck this ageist culture. 




 Going to unleash a shit storm here, but seriously: Means test superannuation.

No seriously, let's look at the biggest 'arguments' and show why it's a fucking cop-out.


**"They've paid tax their entire life."**

* For starters, this doesn't apply to immigrants.
* Paying tax isn't a fucking retirement nest egg plan, it's called playing life.

**"Why should you punish those who have saved for their retirement?"**

* You're not punishing them, they're punishing the future generation by taking from their future retirement who can't afford it, because you fucked the economy.
* Why? Seriously, they listened, they saved, they were never guaranteed a wee bonus for living a long time.

**Let look at a few facts:**

* **We can't afford to keep paying Superannuation at the current rate.**
* As a 27 year old who's the sole breadwinner for their family the government has decided I can't get any assistance or even the fucking community services card, despite the fact we're barely holding our head above water by eating into savings.
* My generation basically cannot hope to have superannuation. Certainly not at 65, probably not even 70 years old. 

So there, fuck your guaranteed money for being old. I'm sick of this ageist culture.

 Don't count me in that basket. I was an angry cynical fuck before my son was even a twinkle in my eye. 




 I think you just summarised most of America there McCyn. 




 Actually not. If you factored in our average wage vs cost of living we are actually comparative to everywhere else.

 [As usual, XKCD hits the nail on the head.](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cell_phones.png) 




 So let's get this straight..
They're fucking over his learning and friends over actually parenting their son and telling him to grow the fuck up and shave?

Yeah, what a life lesson this is. 









 Indeed. But increasing the price without offering any incentive should be business suicide.

However they made $137M profit 2013, and $165M profit in 2014. and $92.5M profit in the 6 months up til December 2014, so this year is expected again bumper profits.

I'm not saying a company can't make profits, obviously that's ultimately what they're there for. But in the same breath a consumer only has appetite for a certain amount of cost, and Sky are pushing that further and further every year to see how far they can go before it blows up in their face. 

That to me seems like an obscenely arrogant way to push up profit at the cost of losing customers. 

Seems like someone has analyzed the NZ public, and has done the math as to what they think Sky can get away with at each incremental charge increase.

Given their profit's only going up and up in substantial amounts it appears that this is done purely for greed sake, as they haven't released anything recently to justify the price increase..

I don't know, I'm not a business analyst, but I'm not stupid, so I can see why, (Profit) I just think it's wrong. (Greed.)

How the fuck do they see logic in this!? 









 Yes, the mods are a bit slow on this one. 




 Yeah, it is to me, but probably not really to anyone else. 









 there's a fucken webpage highlighting how many cuntbags decline to show NZ on a map: http://worldmapswithout.nz/ So yes, it's a fucking big deal with someone actually does take the time to make a fucking accurate map, actually showing NZ.  




 That is a rant worthy of the very title. Well done. 




 Very: Reserve Bank considering new regional lending rules to target Auckland investors... Making it easier for speculators to drive house prices up. 




 Ah ok, in which case the thermal envelope argument is as invalid as with with the 810. 














 Actually this makes sense. Here's why:

* Smaller die fabrication could result in less power consumption, thus less heat production, and increased thermal envelope.
* The average useage scenario for most people is short bursts of activity, so having 4x high performance cores that are available for short bursts makes sense for ensuring UI responsiveness, quick camera processing.
* The 2x medium performance cores which are available for sustained constant useage (think gaming etc.)
* And your 4x low power cores for your fitness tracking, background thumbnail and media processing etc.

As the 810 works for short periods, having something use 50milliwatt for 10milliseconds is preferable than something that uses 40milliwatts for 20milliseconds.  




 And there's another side to that as well, having your dualcore use 20mW at 150ms to get the same result as your octocore using 20mW at 10ms, so it uses more power, but it's significantly faster, so using less power over-all in a 'burst' environment 




 Actually it makes sense, all phones have a thermal envelope to play with. 
Either you can have a 1ghz dual core that can operate at 100% constantly and never hit it..

Or..

You can have a 4ghz Octocore which hits it in 15 seconds.

Now, as you've pointed out, most people don't need their processor working all the time at 100% However most people do want NO LAG, and INSTANTANEOUS response time. This needs immediate grunt on tap.

So where as your dualcore can respond within 150ms at all times
Your Octocore can respond with 10ms for your 15 seconds until you hit your thermal envelope.

Obviously people want a faster response time, over sustained performance, so will go for your Octocore.


 




 Oh noes! You can't sell alcohol for 2 hours! And OH MY GOD! They want you to stop selling near schools!?!? How DARE THEY!?

It's not like you encourage excess drinking by heavily discounting wine and beer, that's silly talk.

And hey, unlike pubs and bars, you supermarkets have ZERO responsibility when it comes to dealing with your 'patrons' once they've consumed your product. That's pretty mint ay?

So that's cool. Let em come, and let them buy to get shit faced at home, cause hey, that's not your problem.

 Australia spend $100,000 sending delegates to UNESCO countries to lobby them against voting the reef as "In Danger" which would severely limit the amount of dredging, dumping and otherwise systematic destruction of the Reef by the government.

This was hidden within the "politics" section, despite the severe implications should they succeed.  









 Yeah, it wouldn't be so bad if the cost was borne by the ultimate winner from those dollars - government, instead of weighing heavily against an already underfunded health department. But I see your point. 




 Did not know this!  




 Exactly, you can't turn someone away from healthcare just cause they don't have insurance. However the current system *appears* to not be working in the best fashion as being owed almost $100M is quite shit. 




 I know people think this is just tourist bashing, but it's just this simple:

Hospitals should be hospitals and help sick people. 
They shouldn't be debt collectors. 
























 Yes, watching it for a third time myself!  














 I understand OP answered your question long term, but shortterm, what does it mean to you? 
Not a lot, the biggest impact will be to farmers.

To your average Jo Bloggs in NZ it will mean bigger more noticable storms, more dry, warm drought ridden spells, coupled with higher winds. (Think Christchurch norwesters.)

To your farmers? It will spell bankruptcy for many, especially dairy farmers, which is typically quite water intensive.

We'll also see produce prices rise, as more foul weather will result in bad crops. 




 I don't know, hence the question mark.
I can tell you year ending 2013 $6.67 billion was spent by tourist.
However you're missing the point. [Source](http://www.med.govt.nz/sectors-industries/tourism/pdf-docs-library/key-tourism-statistics/key-tourism-statistics.pdf)

Tourists pay for conservation.  




 I am. 

We've fucked the weather up, fossil fuel use coupled with deforestation means we're fucked hard.  




 Actually small towns like the Franz Joseph makes hundreds (millions?) of thousands of dollars from tourists, some of which is pumped back into conservation. 

So ironically by saying "it's bad for the environment" it's quite the opposite 




 It's fucking tragic. One of my best family trip memories is going to Franz Joseph glacier, and seeing the actual foot of the glacier.

It's depressing to think I can never repeat that same trip with my son. 




 Fuck you cunts, I was right.

 Hahaha, good point! 




 Yeah, fair call. .. I don't have a leg to stand on here. Out of respect  to his family I've removed my comment. 




 Yeah, but more the ability to add rules to it - "only for Wifi" for instance. (On unrooted phones as I figure this would be possible via an exposed module?)

I know there's a restrict background data option for 3G, but for people on limited data plans it still doesn't help if you're conserving your data and you accident open Snapchat, and it starts to load all the featured stories!

But yes, I also miss AppOps. 




 Far more useful I would think is giving access to like a Firewall of sorts, allowing us to ban certain apps from communicating with the internet, or access to 3g/Wifi? 




 We're not celebrating his death, we're celebrating the fact he didn't kill anyone else. 




 What would you rather? "Oh the police shouldn't have chased him"?
 




 Very awesome, amazes me our skies our clear enough to see that much! 














 Oh good lord. Right, so it's really sounding like they may have been the makers of their demise. 









 Ah ok, I presume then I didn't see any social/media backlash due to being in Chch, not Rangiora. Makes sense. 




 Jesus. Thanks Bruska, that's excellent legwork.
I wonder what the stats are for Chch? (I've tried looking them up but couldn't find anything as detailed as that!) 




 No, you're completely right. It's just funny, there was such a community backlash when they proposed similar rules here in chch, but they've just simple implemented it in Rangiora.

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy about it - I'm too old and ugly to go bars and pubs but I'm just wondering why/how they were able to swiftly put it in place without public backlash akin to that of Chch. 




 Touch. But I'm curious to know how they weighed this up vs the livelihood of the affected establishments?  









 thank you Fogeater132, I haven't configured external access yet, as it's going through a Vodafone branded router with no UPNP/port forward configuration options so it keeps failing. Thank you very much for your kind offer!

 Haha, thanks for the laugh. No this is a 350MB rip of Stargate.
I was up to S05 E11. It glitched and lagged, no refuses to play any stargate episodes whatsoever. (Yes, even stuff it's played just yesterday.) No changes to my machine, no updates to Plex.

2.4ghz Good signal to chromecast.

I can stream other content (720p Family guy) no worries. It just refuses to play all my Stargate episodes.
 




 Thanks, I did google and researched before I came here, but nothing stood out as being as useful.  




 Thank you I'll check it out.  




 It stuttered and crashed half way through playing stargate now it refuses to play content it's played in the past, changed the transcoder quality settings. 

Restarted phone, factory reset chromecast, rebooted computer, refuses to play them.

I'll change content type to home movies, about the only thing I can try, or else I'll give kodi a go, thanks!

 No, revenge doesn't even come into the equation.


My very rough understanding of the law is take into account all the actions, all the facts, without prejudice or feelings.
Heavily coming into this is it's the child's mother. We wouldn't be having this discussion if it were another relative.

As I keep saying, as far as the law's concerned, this baby was killed by a mothers negligence. 

There's an entirely innocent victim here, and while it's beyond heartbreaking for the mother I feel the weight of the act that was carried out needs to conveyed with a different sentence than discharged without conviction.  




 It would recognise that there was a victim here. A baby who paid the ultimate price for someone else's negligent actions. 
This woman is a victim of her own incredibly tragic making, the baby is an entirely innocent victim here. 
 




 No, I would imagine to the mother, no pain is enough as no pain will bring back their child.

I'm not wishing any further punishment on the mother, who as I said will suffer every single day, for the rest of her life.

I just do not believe it's fair to reflect the way this poor child died with a discharge without conviction.  




 I am. 
I put myself into her shoes. 
If this were to happen to my son, I would feel like the worst human being out there. 
The guilt alone would cause immense palpable pain every day. 
Whatever the justice system could do to me would be mere pittance to the unbridled passion with which I would hate myself every single day I lived.

However we must let the law run its course, the police speak for the baby who lost their life, they want justice for her not just split second, but ongoing negligence for hours which caused the baby to suffer. 




 I'm going to be downvoted here, but this woman isn't a victim, her child is.

For everyone asking for a discharge without conviction can we at least recognise the severe and extreme pain that poor child would have been in before they died?

The simple fact here is a baby, whose entire existence is dependent upon their family, died due to her mothers inattention. 
Regardless of culpability this victim suffered before she died horribly, and her sentence needs to reflect that.

To allow her to get away with this with a discharge without conviction is not recognising the extreme pain this baby suffered due to her negligence.
