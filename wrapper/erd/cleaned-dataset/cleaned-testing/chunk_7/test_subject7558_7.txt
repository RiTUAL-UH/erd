 Can we get a confirmation on where you got it from or what? Jesus. I need it in my life. 




 Sometimes out of nowhere I'll go through a nausea kick, no matter which strain I use. Just had one recently, about 3 weeks ago. Lasted about a week. IDK where they come from but I'm glad they leave lol. 




 There's no way of knowing whether it will help the worst of your withdrawals, because we don't know how much morphine will be in your tea. It has the potential to get you higher than kratom ever could if it's a good batch, so obviously that would obliterate withdrawals. There's just no way to know without either doing it or doing some fancy pants lab magic and finding out how much morphine is in it. And yeah, definitely a cross tolerance. I mean, maybe if you sip tiny amounts every day, don't even catch any sort of buzz, and just not get sick... I suppose kratom may work again after a while of that. But I don't really know, there's just no telling with PST.  




 Yep. Nope. Bad idea. Since poppy seed tea is essentially morphine, it would make much more sense to use kratom to get off poppy seed tea, rather than the other way around. Heh. Not to mention, poppy seed tea is a huge crap shoot. You could get 6 mg of morphine, or you could get 600 and fucking die.  




 Super sketch son. 




 Same here. It would be cool if the KGs were about 50 bucks cheaper... there's a lot of places that are definitely cheaper than HS... but with HS, I know what I'm getting, and you can't put a price on that. 




 Never been there, but I've been to Texas. The first time I ever tried ice was in Texas, I forgot to drink water for 3 days and ended up in the hospital. I've been careful to hydrate very well ever since then, especially on meth... not that I do meth anymore. 




 Probably dippin into OP's kratom sacks. 




 Somebody in Austin be fuckin up. 




 Get a tracheotomy done and just scoop the kratom directly into your neck hole. 




 Why you stirring the pot, son? 




 Here you go. http://www.freeflys.com/ 




 Sick prices bro. 

You misspelled "speciosa" up near the top of the page. 

You misspelled "difference" in your motto "Smell the difference". I see you "copyrighted" it, you'll probably want to fix that quick cuz a copyright symbol after a blundered phrase looks sort of unprofessional. 

Under "The Truth" page, you have "comeback" instead of "come back", the latter being correct the correct version. 

You also have "headyherb@outlook.com" as your email, which could very well be your email, I just wanted to let you know just in case it's supposed to say "headyherbs@outlook.com".

I'll keep an eye out for reviews on your shit. Interested to see what's up. 




 Me too 




 I've only ordered from MS twice, both times it was Bali and for some reason I was having a negative reaction to it... never had their red veins. I'm sure MS's other stuff is good or whatever but I haven't tried anything else from them. Some people say the quality is the same, some say HS's quality is lower, some say it's higher, but the one thing I do know is that it's just a better deal. I'm not trying to plug for HS or anything, just sharing my experience. There are vendors out there who are cheaper than HS and supposedly have just as good or better quality but I haven't tried them so I can't recommend any of them personally. 




 http://www.herbal-salvation.com/cat/Ingredients.cfm/id/RVTPWDR boom. There's a second page with more products on it. That's where the Thai hides. Red vein Borneo is great too but the red vein Sumatran is my favorite. The quality is great. The shipping label says Viable Solutions, LLC. The bags of kratom have strain name, company name, and not meant for human consumption. Not sure which you meant by labeling. 




 5g when you get up, 5g between 3-5 pm, 5g around 9. Keep doing it even if it doesn't seem to satisfy your urge, because you're not satisfied the way you're doing it now anyway. If you stick to that, each day you'll start to feel it a little more, and eventually you'll get back to feeling good from it again. I've done it in this rhythm for six months and it works perfectly for me. Sometimes I took too much for a couple days and screwed up my tolerance, I just stuck to my usual dose and it went right back down. I have one of those nifty 2 and 6 gram scoops from HS, and a scale, although I don't use either because I know what 2g looks like now.  EDIT: I get up at 6 AM. The timing of your second and third dose are obviously relative compared to the time your first dose of the day is. Second dose should be between 9-11 hours after your first dose, and then your third dose would be 15 hours after you wake up, roughly. Might take some tweaking but I think it would work. 




 Lol you're on this shit every day, how did it take you 17 days to see it? You must be in a fierce kratom fog. I want. 




 He surely was. 




 RVS. RVT. RVB.  




 Don't ever apologize for taking the test_subject7558's side, son. 




 Yep, I referred to it in this thread the other day: http://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/2zv9w1/been_ordering_from_same_vendor/

I thought I was the only one who felt that way. 

A lot of people say the differences between vein colors are all in your head, but they don't know what it's like to be sensitive to certain veins. It's pretty fuckin blatantly obvious to me. 




 I just wanted to show you what a healthy log looks like. Why must you hate? I did it for you, man... I did it for you. 




 As if "Leslie" is a better name for a dude.  




 IF YOU LOVE IT SO MUCH, WHY DON'T YOU MARRY IT 




 No, it's a person who sells toilets... sort of like a soda jerk sells sodas. You don't want to take kratom before them because they're notoriously selfish, you should always offer them the first dose. You can't blame them, you would be selfish too if you spent your days trying to talk people into buying something to shit in. 




 Don't act like you're not impressed. 




 Relevant: http://imgur.com/i4KwIc9         (NSFW) 




 Precisely. My grandfather was Phallus Tickler, Esq. Surely you've heard of him. 




 I suppose that depends who you ask. 




 If there's one thing I know about redosing, it's that you don't do it right before a toilet jerk, or you're gonna have a bad time. 




 My middle name is Redose. Boner Redose Tickler. 




 What. 




 I always had a crush on Bea Arthur. I'd eat her shit if she needed me to.  




 Sometimes I run out of spring water and I have to use ginger ale (that I usually chase with as an anti-nausea tool) and I'm always surprised at how easy it is. It's like it fizzes up when it mixes with the kratom and makes it so I can't really feel the powder I'm swallowing, just soda fizz.  




 Gotta be. 




 You ever try to taper off the tram? I can't even imagine how tram has you by the balls like that. Kratom does way more for me effects-wise than tram ever has. I don't even feel tram, I think I must be what they call a non-responder.  




 Why don't you quit being a dickface  




 YMMV, my nuggah. 




 I've used it several times for other things and I never received it the next day. It was 2 days every time. 




 I hear that loud and clear man. It's a pain right in the nutsack. 




 I'm envious of you then lol. Last time I took a half g of Maeng Da, my skull felt like it was caving in. Weird shit man. 




 So the only angle they must have is a plan to reveal the strain names after so long then right? That would be the only thing that makes sense. It's still not right to leave people clueless about whether they're uppers or downers or inbetweeners though. Granted, people don't have to take them, but it just seems like a foolish move on MS's part. But then again, they must be doing something right lol. 




 Unbiased? Why do they need it unbiased? Are they taking surveys from them to find out which ones they like? This is a serious question, I do not know. And I'm not mad, I just don't get it. I am a touch jelly of their sick loot sacks and notoriety though. 




 Yeah man, I cannot believe that MS hands out samples and doesn't even clue people in on whether it's an upper or a downer strain. Upper strains seriously make me feel like I'm going to have a seizure. Idk what kind of slick bullshit MS thinks they're up to, they could at least inform people of the vein color or up/down effect. You would think they would at least do that for their loyal customers that pay $50 for 100 grams like it's the only god damn kratom source on Earth. But no, it's all a secret fuck fuck game, as if they have secret formulas they don't want other vendors to steal or some shit. I just don't understand what people see in them. I don't get it, and I'm actually really jelly of MS, cuz those mother fuckers are ballin big dog style. Tons of customers paying that kind of money, I can't even imagine what their profits are like. I hope someday I run a legal racket half as profitable as they do. 




 I have a penis and not a vagina so I toss and wash. 




 Smoking black tar heroin can stop your shitter right up. A lot of people here seem to believe that the reason your shitter gets stopped up is because we're consuming all that powder. I personally believe it's the effect of the drug and its alkaloids on your body that cause the constipation, not because of the powder physically stopping you up. I can take Bali from any vendor at 18 grams a day and shit like a pro. But if I throw red vein Sumatran into the mix, as I always do, my shitter jams right up and stops working. You could start taking a tiny 8 mg Suboxone pill once a day and you might not shit for a week, and it's certainly not because the pill is causing some sort of obstruction. It's just what opioid(ish) substances do. Am I saying consuming 50 grams a day isn't going to physically obstruct your bowels to a degree? No, it could certainly contribute, but the primary reason your shitter doesn't shit is because of the alkaloids within the leaf, not the leaf itself.  




 I changed the blade halfway through the shave, no difference. I tried all angles. I might cop some feather blades and give it a shot, but if that doesn't work, I don't know that I want to drop however  much money on a nicer one if it's not going to do the deed. 




 Some cheap ass piece of shit from eBay. That's why I'm wondering if it just doesn't hold the razor at the correct angle or some shit. 




 I haven't tried a different blade yet, just the Astra ones that came with it. I planned on trying some feather blades I guess? What blades do you use? 




 Show him your reddit username, or else. 




 14 years old and you own a tea company? I need to reevaluate my life. 




 Ohhhh so you and I just blew their cover? Dang. How could we be so stupid?  




 What is this burn you guys keep talking about? Do you mean you're smoking it? You're probably constipated cuz you're smoking it bro. Cut that shit out. 




 Nope, it's on correctly. Thanks though. 




 Alright, I got a safety razor off eBay for 10 bucks, it came with 5 Astra blades. Sometimes i get a halfway decent shave with it (never as good as with a disposable), other times (like tonight) I can't get close at all. I tried getting these same hairs for 20 minutes, couldn't get them, then grabbed a double blade disposable and immediately eradicated them with one swipe. I changed the blade on the safety razor, did not help at all. I also tried all angles of holding it. I shaved with the grain, against the grain, and sideways. I really want to like this razor. I really do. I feel like a big dog when I shave with it but I don't look like a big dog without a big dog smooth shave. Does it just not bend the blade to the correct angle? Would a Gillette Fatboy really make a difference? Or should I just call it quits and go back to disposables? Thanks in advance. 




 I took it maybe 6 or 7 times back in the day, and I always took 300 mg. I stopped taking it because it's just fuckin retarded, but I was never sensitive to it like this back then. I dunno but you're right, no DXM ever again. 




 I took kratom at 8 pm tonight, a full 24 hours after I took the 15 mg of DXM. I can still feel the DXM more than the kratom. I just hope tomorrow morning the shit is finally fuckin gone because I can't deal with this dex glow anymore. The fact that I can still feel it so much is blowing my fucking mind apart. 




 Go on the darknet and find somebody who will relay and ship the kratom to you in Indiana for a fee. 




 Why don't you just get a PO box in Ohio? Boom. Problem solved. How you wanna do this? Money order? I got Paypal too. 




 I have anxiety problems as well. Maeng Da and white veins do it to me too, along with a slew of other symptoms.  I just don't take upper strains and I don't have those problems.  




 Yeah. I should have heeded your warning.  




 Yeah they're a bunch of old mother fuckers. Early bird style 




 Thank Jesus I didn't take thirty mg like I kept reading. I'm really sensitive to some things. I gotta go to dinner with my family at 3 today, I would usually eat kratom right before but now I'm beginning to think I should skip it and maybe tonight's dose too. 




 I went ahead and tried the DXM potentiation method. I took one 15 mg coughgel thirty minutes before my dose last night. All it did was space me the fuck out and make me feel really uncomfortable and shaky. Sleep was fitful. I got up this morning feeling pretty normal again, I go drop my morning dose and fuckin bam... That bullshit feeling hits me like a ton of bricks again. Now I'm at fuckin work feeling like shit and I'm pissed. I took it last night specifically because I didn't have to work at that time. Am I going to feel it like this at my afternoon dose too? When does it go away? I took it at 8 pm last night. I feel a lot of regret for this decision. It doesn't feel like kratom potentiation at all, I don't even feel the kratom. It's more like DXM potentiation. I feel like I took 150 mg of DXM.
