 typical reddit user. wrong again. seen many, many movies, and i like these ones.  




 agreed 




 I partially agree they're not perfect films but i dont take them small criticisms and use them to say they're terrible like everyone else. I THINK they're very good films.  




 not fact 




 no, your wrong, completely wrong 




 The Hurt Locker  




 thanks! 




 I read that they did but no on the Newswire. 
Is it officially coming to PS4? I'd love it if it did.  




 i need someone to give me $$$$s 




 just because a movie you dont like has a high % on RT doesnt mean RT should go. get a grip pls, thanks.  




 I like The Hobbit, Quantum of Solace, Man of Steel, Indiana Jones 4 (what I remember of it) - Dark knight Rises is one of my all time favorites. 

Hipster reddit pricks, Hate me all you want - I like these films.  




 I'd do a Toy Story and Monsters Inc crossover. It's the only one i could think of that wouldn't need any convenient plot points to get the characters together. Say Mike or Sulley goes into Bonnie's bedroom one night, the toys wake and "the adventure begins" so to speak. what would you do? (no hate)
