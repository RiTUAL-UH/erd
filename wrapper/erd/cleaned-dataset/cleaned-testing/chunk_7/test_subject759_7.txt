 I'm not sure what was happening here: someone in the comments said it was a black protest march. So the gun guys decided to make it an open carry march? I can see how that's a bit presumptive maybe but the gun dudes didn't seem to be bothering anyone; was is considered racist to bring guns to a black march? He seemed to be marching in support with the black people, just with guns.. So that's racist? I don't get it. I'm not even into guns or open carry laws etc but why did the gun dude seem like the most reasonable person there? I was confused by it. I was confused by the whole thing.  




 oh calamari thats another one i love! clams are pretty good too, and mussels and especially scallops! I'll add conch to the list of strange seafood i gotta try! 




 you are VERY welcome. i can relate to feeling guilty over just about anything; i dont know why but guilt has always been a huge part of my anxiety issues. its like, i KNOW im trying to do the right thing and be a good person but somehow it often FEELS like im just a douche, if that makes sense? one of the hardest things sometimes is taking care of yourself and being kind to yourself. i think because we worry we are just being selfish or narcissistic ourselves, but not wanting to take on someone elses issues because you know how much it will hurt you actually shows empathy, in my opinion, which is the opposite of narcissism. especially if they only want you to hurt anyway.

its like; if you can pull a drowning person out of the water, you can try to help them and give them mouth to mouth and bring them back to you. but if you cant pull them out, if they are fighting you and dont want your help, you have to recognize that before they drag you under with them. 

sorry that got a bit dramatic at the end there but i think its still relevant :/ i think knowing you are doing the right thing and dealing with your own guilt issues is a far more manageable task than dealing with other people abusing and shaming you because of THEIR issues. its not worth it, you do not deserve it, you are better than that and although it may not feel like it, there is NO SHAME in saving your own life (literally or metaphorically) if and when it comes to that.

 i can definitely appreciate that. i actually generally like those kinds of "niche" foods (another one thats a super overrated thing i really like is escargot with garlic butter) but now i dont know if ive ever tried cavier. i'm gunna have to do it sometime. 




 like, im not even saying cavier is gross, but talk about overrated; crazy expensive, tiny portions, status symbol (at least the "good stuff") fish eggs... its pretty weird if you think about it for too long.. 




 haters gonna hate, you just do you, bro. 




 learn to say the alphabet backwards: whenever people hear thats a sobriety test they are like WHAT i cant even do that sober! then you could be like oh yea? check THIS out ;)
