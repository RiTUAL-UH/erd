 Some people aren't really into the whole "you just need to get past this first boring thousand page setup book then it gets good" thing 




 It's intellectually dishonest to group every woman's issue - most very pressing and relevant - with this cowardly act of giving in to censorship 




 science fiction

noun

fiction based on imagined future scientific or technological advances and *major social or environmental changes*, frequently portraying space or time travel and life on other planets. 




 do you get points for killing unarmed black people in this game 




 Never heard of Spatterjay before. Looked it up and it sounds good, added to the TBR list 




 * *Dune* by Frank Herbert
* *The Road* by Cormac McCarthy
* *1984* by George Orwell
* *A Clockwork Orange* by Anthony Burgess
* *Cat's Cradle* by Kurt Vonnegut

cliched list but whatever
 




 Because kicking the crap out of people and burying your emotions are clearly qualities to hold in high esteem 




 Mainly wondering if there are daily deals within the weekend sale 




 Any chance any of these titles gets cheaper throughout the weekend? 




 *A Good Man is Hard to Find* or *Everything that Rises Must Converge* by Flannery O'Connor 









 Try Jesse Ball 









 Intent is the key here - it's clearly an act of satire. It's a joke that's meant to be a little bit shocking/offensive. I don't think it's something we should be stringing up the mother over. 




 What "behavior" is actually so offensive here? It's not like he's reading passages from the book to the class 









 You aren't alone 




 Is that what we're basing this on, not quality? You're right that it isn't close, but the movie is better. 









 Go watch the nutty professor 




 It's a dumb idea that won't inspire voracious reading regardless of what the kids dress up as - that is created at home over years of encouraging reading as a parent. Let the kids have their fun. 




 Drive, A Clockwork Orange, No Country for Old Men, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, There Will Be Blood 




 Jesse Ball's work - *Samedi the Deafness*, *The Way Through Doors*, *The Curfew*, *Silence Once Begun*...beautiful dreamlike writing 









 also High Rise 




 harry crews is the best 









 I like your list. Films I'd put on:

Drive, A Clockwork Orange, No Country for Old Men, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, There Will Be Blood 





























 Except it sort of did. ..

 *All the Light We Cannot See* by Anthony Doerr


From this [interview](http://www.powells.com/blog/interviews/anthony-doerr-the-powells-com-interview-by-jill/) -

DOERR: Good, good! Certainly even though the book looks thick, I think the pages are friendly to readers because there's a lot of white space. I think you can actually turn the pages quickly. My prose can be dense. I love to pile on detail. I love to describe. I'm much more reluctant to give the reader entrance into a character's feeling than describe what's around him or her and have the reader intuit the internal life of a character. I know that's demanding, so this was a gesture of friendliness, maybe. It's like I'm saying to the reader, "I know this is going to be more lyrical than maybe 70 percent of American readers want to see, but here's a bunch of white space for you to recover from that lyricism." 




 great use of irony, you will go far as a writer! 




 I love how half of this sub takes being stubborn enough to realize that they only read white men and rather than think "hmm maybe I'm inadvertently missing a large portion of literature that I could enjoy" they just wear it like a badge of honor instead 




 He's not for everyone. Skip 




 Mentions is one thing, claiming 99 percent of a book devoted sub hasn't heard of him is another 




 Anyone with a small familiarity with Lovecraft knows who he is - I think you're overshooting it a bit buddy 




 The original comment  that is now deleted people were talking about linked to a different review of the same book. I am pretty excited to pick it up as well.  









  Yes blacks in America had it rough. But with the passing of each year it falls deeper into the past and becomes less relevant.

Did you watch the news at all in the past year? What you are saying is patently wrong.

 I used to like NPR but their daily hour of skin color talk and articles is sickening.

Imagine being black and having to deal with it all the time?

 No one is stopping black people from writing books. And patting those who do on the head is patronizing and segregatory. When I read a book the author's skin color has nothing to do with how I feel about the book.

Not the point, and handwaving away actual issues that black authors have to deal with. From the article:
 Nearly twenty years later, that prejudice abounds: Whitewashed covers, hostile dismissals of "identity politics" and "political correctness" as a barely-veiled attempt to silence us, all-white panels on diversity, all-white anthologies of "the best" science fiction, and continual institutional barriers to traditional publication based on appeals to marketability that really reflect the publishing houses' disbelief in the power and appeal of black storytelling. 




 There is a huge difference. With black writers, as in this article, the discussion is centered around the push for equality and fair treatment. If you singled out white science fiction writers and wrote an article, what would be the purpose besides a feeling of superiority? 




 amazingly, you can do both 




 shit, guess i am a trendsetter 


































 nice humblebrag post 














 Reading to babies is something you should definitely start now. It feels useless but pays off huge. 

That said you have plenty of time to save up fifty bucks for harry potter  




 I don't know, I disagree and sort of agree with the author. There are degrees of failure, and I'll always prefer the interesting but flawed over the contemporary. I guess that's the point of the article though, I don't think either of us are wrong.  





























 Not being aware of what's going on in the world is nothing to be proud of.  




 Start reading 




 *A Cure for Suicide* by Jesse Ball 




 Yes, I'm pretty sure they were in high school 




 Yes. Sometimes I even do them at the same time 









 I can't wait to read it, just waiting on the library 









 *The Devil All the Time* by Donald Ray Pollock 









 what a rough life 









 First Law trilogy by Joe Abercrombie 




 Seconded, a great resource for keeping track of the series. 














 Doctor Sleep was pretty boring.  



















 Not so much the ideas, but the impact. When I finished reading the book, my initial thoughts of the book were very lukewarm. An OK read, not sure it was worth the hype. Despite my initial reaction, I found myself fondly thinking of it often the next few weeks. Ended up rereading The Airborne toxic event chapters and enjoyed it a lot more the second time 




 Sam pink, Scott mcclanahan, Steve roggenbuck, juliet escoria, Chloe caldwell, Chelsea Martin, jesse ball, Tao Lin, Ellen Kennedy, michael seidlinger, Catherine Lacey, Amelia grey, Megan boyle, Alissa nutting...

Not sure exactly what you're looking for but something in there probably fits the bill 




 This is how it initially works, the reason they aren't the same throughout is because teams trade their picks 




 White Noise by Don Delillo. Took a while for it to sink in for whatever reason 




 Stick to children's books 




 While it's true, he does have some novels where he's clearly showing his King influence - *Sunburnt* and *The Sorrow King* for example 




 That one  is *Off Season* 




 Yes same guy 




 Lovecraft,  Laird Barron, Andersen Prunty, Brian Evenson, Jeremy Johnson, Jack Ketchum 




 Depends on the series. I did it with *Dune* and *Ender's Game* since I read beforehand you can easily stop at the first - they are both more or less self contained novels. 




 Unpopular opinion here, but I really hated this book. Found it vaguely interesting at first, but as the book progressed there are just a ton of infodumps, and I started getting very bored. I didn't find it funny at all either, just totally didn't mesh with my sort of humor. Also has one of the worst sex scenes ever written 




 Cool, that rarely happens and that made me smile.

I can see how he could come off as obnoxious, but stuff like directing As I Lay Dying and Child of God made me respect him, and I've seen him supporting lesser known works like *Scarecrone* by Melissa Broder and *Black Cloud* by Juliet Escoria on his social media. Plus I like his stoner movies :)

 




 I'd argue that even though Franco is a shitty writer, he does a lot more to promote poetry and literature than to dissuade people from it. Franco is the man 














 5 star - *Eat Pray Love* by Elizabeth Gilbert 

1 star - *The Easter Parade* by Richard Yates 









 Not sure about Freakonomics (I thought it was entertaining enough), but for Malcolm Gladwell, it's because he uses a lot of anecdotal evidence over actual research, and uses his writing to dress up what ends up being a lot of fluff 





























 They are nowhere near Dan Brown/Patterson level of that's what you're asking. Don't be afraid of the series' popularity and the backlash anything popular brings with it. The books are entertaining and intelligent page turners.Give them a try, you might end up really liking it 



























































 And yet this sub loves other, worse authors. Ender's Game is constantly recommended despite the author being a raging hatred filed homophobe. Wool is constantly recommended despite Hugh Howey being a huge scammer and fraud. They both fit the type of books reddit likes though so they're kosher, unlike fifty shades 




 This sub is funny. "Who cares what people read as long as they are reading" is practically the slogan here, but only if it applies to an acceptable YA series. 

I have no interest in fifty shades but I don't waste my time worrying about how many people read/see it 




 It is incredibly popular  




 Who's the clown that brought star fox adventures  




 Final fantasy tsw is terrible 














 You're giving him the rub-ins. You can act like you're just being a nice guy, but you're just giving him a subtle "fuck you, i smashed you" even if you're unaware of it. 




 he's clearly a douche but you also instigated it bigtime 




 *The Third Bear*, a collection of Vandermeer's short stories, is criminally underrated, it's so good. Check it out 














 Reading to your kids is so important. There's really zero excuse not to do it. Start the day you bring them home from the hospital. Even something like *Goodnight Moon* or *Hop on Pop* teaches them so much - letter recognition, memorization, vocabulary, phrases, and more. Make sure you interact with them while reading too! Don't just drone on. Ask them questions, have them point things out to you, make it even more fun for them.
