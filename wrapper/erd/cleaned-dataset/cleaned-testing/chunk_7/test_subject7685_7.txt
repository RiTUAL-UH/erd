 What do you mean "shitty on purpose"? Why? 




  totally worth it

What was the benefit of pre-ordering it? I've always seen it as a waste of time. It's not like not pre-ordering makes you not get the game. 




 You must get tired of saying that, lol. 




 Or maybe the kid was taught to be nice to people. 




 Looks to me like he does have a leg. Explain yourself, OP. 




 Yes. Yes we have.

This ending was part of the reason some people believed Reiko to be Shao Khan. This has since been dismissed as false. 




 So when BAE (whatever the fuck that's meant to mean, I'm assuming it's girlfriend) is home a random guy runs over two other random guys with a golf buggy? 




 Not me. I always make sure my character specialises in either destruction or archery, for this exact reason.

I thought everyone did that. 




 Is it just me, or is Uwe Boll known for making fucking terrible films? I mean really fucking bad movies. 




 Quite lucky. Also, awesome grandad for having a HDPVR.  









 Wow. You must have been rich. Now at could I afford to buy anything over 100 when I was in school.  




 He didn't get his finger bit off. His finger was bitten off.  




 These guys have been through some shit. Sorry they're not ugly bags of steroids as seems to be your preference. 




 What would you say is a good game? 




 Considering each character is 3.99 I was expecting at the very least 2 costumes per character. Very disappoint.  




 Is the guy who voiced that bad guy the same guy who voiced Fatman in Metal Gear Solid 2? Sounded like him at times.  




 Hackers can be funny sometimes. Take this fella for example. http://youtu.be/zWV5CcR2EY0 




 No I never mixed my substances. Maybe it did dilate the pupils as you say, but because I was doing pills around the same time period that made my pupils really dilate the coke dilation wasn't as noticeable. 




 Yeah. Either him or Freeman. I've never thought much of Gordon Freeman he has no character. All he does is kill things with guns (mostly) just like the rest do, except they've got character.

Well, I'm not sure if MC has any character. But at least MC wasn't partly responsible for the crisis he has to stop like Gordon was, lol.  




 Cocaine never caused my eyes to dilate back when I dabbled with it, ecstasy did though. Jesus Christ. 

Left all that shit in the past.  




 Daedric armour is awesome looking and I'll not hear otherwise!

**places fingers in ears**

Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalallal 




 I don't believe this. I've never seen a leaderboard in a mobile game that wasn't topped by blatant cheaters with impossible scores.  




 Then that kid needs glasses.  




 At the start of the game it's accurate, if you're not wearing iron armour and bulging with muscles.

At the end Of the game it's just fucking dumb. But then again every time a kid in skyrim opens their mouth it pisses me off. Little shits.  




 Maybe only humans can be an expendable. Yes I know chief isn't entirely human but whatever.  




 You'd rather see Marcus than who? I think Marcus is awesome too.  




 It sounds like he's taking issue with the fact that I mentioned I'd seen it before. Like I was saying it to get some sort of false sense of superiority or some shit.  




 Depends on how much he ingested and how strong it was.  




 I have no idea. I'm. Not involved in the project.  




 On consoles? Unlikely.  




 That's just like, your opinion man.  




 In fairness daedric armour looks awesome and badass.

Different opinions eh? 




 In real life yeah, but in the land of Tamriel seeing someone running at you wearing that is usually the last thing you do. 




 console.modless 




 That sounds awesome. Bethesda should implement that into console versions. 




 Skyrim is a fairly racist land. I doubt other races have kids there. 




 Doesn't work on console though does it? 




 If I was out in the wilds of skyrim and someone started running at me in daedric armour I'd be scared. My character wouldn't, but I would.  




 Then they're wrong. My high elf was bulging with muscles and powerful magical energies. He looks tough no matter what he's wearing.  




 Thanks. Glad I could make you smile.  




 It was either him or be ruled by the Scots. We chose the lesser of two evils.  




 Disregard my previous comment. I just realised the use of the word flaming could cause some confusion/jokes.  




 Just like the expendables.  




  It he died having the time of his life.  




 I know! I've always been sure that they wouldn't be such cocky little shits if they knew they weren't indestructible.  




 I just wanted to let him know that I have enjoyed that gif in the past, and now he allowed me to enjoy it again today.

And that makes me a weirdo? 




 Exactly.  




 Skyrim is always relevant.



Until Elsweyr comes out of course.  




 It's so you can't fuck up quests. They should give you an option to turn off mission specific NPC's invincibility.  




 I've never seen an edgy teenage look anything like someone wearing daedric armour. I'm glad I don't have your vision.  




 I wasn't swinging it around, I walked past her and she felt compelled to comment. Is swinging a flaming sword now associated with homosexuality? I have trouble keeping with kid's mentalities these days.  




 RIP Uncle Buck. 




 People still associate the word coloured with race? Seriously though my parents sometimes still say coloured when referring to black people. I always make a point to them about how old that makes them sound. 




 Not on console :( 




 Cool! 




 Leon? 




 Feel the rhyme! 




 Does it? What makes you say that? It's an edited version of the box art. 




 No worries mate. 




 I was 8 when it came out, I guess that may have coloured my opinion of the film forever. 




 Shhshshh!! Get out of here with your lies!

Seriously though I was pretty certain that although I made that up on the spot I wasn't the first person to say it. It sounded to good to be something I was the first to say. 




 "Ya mon." 




 You think Titanic is far better than Cool Runnings? Get out! 




 Differing opinions then. I don't care for war films, especially WW2 films. 




  I'm going to go to my parents house and see if I can dig up the old VHS and a player. My girlfriend is not going to be pleased on our next "date night".

That's cool but... why not just watch a digital version? 




 when my friend showed me how to kick with both feet at the same time in Duke Nukem 3D it blew my mind. One of the few memories I have of Duke. 




 I think you're simply reading too much into what is at the very least a bad joke. 




   they need the contrasting personality

I disagree. They just need to be able to kick an insane amount of ass and look great doing it. I think these guys qualify. 




 Truthfully? 




 No I don't want to kiss your egg! 




 Haven't seen that in a while. Thanks for the laugh. 




 Was Arnie expendable in Predator?

Was Stallone expendable in Rambo?

Was Statham expendable in Mean Machine?

It's not a post made to ahdere to the strict definition of the word expendable. It's merely a reference to the recent action films starring people who've seen a ton of action in their films, as these characters have seen a ton of action in their games. If you were to enter battle, I'm pretty sure you'd be happy to have these guys in there with you. 




 I guess they only included people known for being in good games. I know a couple of Duke game are good but he is kinda known for being in shitty games at this point. Forever was the final nail in the coffin. 




 Hard times make hard people.

Just made that up, copyright Alex Harper! 




 You've seen what before. The gif? My post? The comment I made? I'm assuming it's the comment I made since you quoted it. Are you upset that you've seen those words arranged in that order previously in your life? 




 Yeah man, it certainly wasn't a comedy.

Jk. I actually quite like that film. 









 Agreed. 




 I haven't seen it for many years. 




  but is actually quite loosely based on the true events

So like pretty much every other film that's based on true events. 




 Perhaps I should have included the word "truthfully" in the title. 




 I did, except nearly half of them are unkillable. I had to reload. 




 Enjoy ;) 




 No I don't want to kiss your lucky egg! 




 I work in the Thom Building. 




 I see a man who won't take no crap, from no-one! 




 Apology accepted. I only hope the rampant aggression and rudeness displayed in this comment doesn't become a regular thing.

Nobody needs that. 




 Love that gif. Always have. I imagine the two scenarios being incredibly similar. 




 Playing on console you can't kill kids :(

I tried of course, once. I had to reload when the only NPCs left in Whiterun were the invincible ones. 




 It's Cool Runnings. 




 Cool Runnings. 







































 For quick clips I'll use the share button on the PS4. For actual produced videos I'll use my Hauppauge HDPRV Gaming 2. 




 Mudcrabs, confirmed! 




 Hey, I'm a millennial (if by millenial you mean someone born between 10980 and 2000), and I had to remember my friend's phone numbers as a kid.

Edit: I meant "1980 and 2000". Not "10980 and 2000". Lol. 




 If that's the case then we can safely ignore it forever. I can't think of anything more useless than an endless countdown clock. 




 Didn't look like any sea I've seen. 




 It's called a househusband. 




 Not exist. It's pretty weird that she does that. 




 ...aaaaaand committed to memory. 




 Exactly. Fuck all the trolls saying "Fallout 4 looks last gen!"

Bitch, have you played Fallout 3 on PS3? Compare that to the Fallout 4 trailer and shut the hell up. 




 144p

Now there's a resolution I've not seen in a long time. 




 Because they like meat, but they don't want to be involved with the process of slaughtering them, down to the consumer level. 




 I'm not involved with the project so I don't know the details I'm afraid. It seems pretty quick to be real time, I assume it's sped up a little, but it might not be. This is just displayed on one of the monitors in reception. 




 And the textures set to "Almost existing, but not quite." 




 That was awesome. 




 This is cool. The fact I can tell who they're meant to represent without any real facial features is a testament to your skill.

But who's the blue guy? James with a bit of chin fluff? 














 They'd definitely tell if there was a prize 

If you knew what the prize was you'd realise how dumb that sounds. 




 I don't know how well the characters in Mortal Kombat are balanced, they seem pretty balanced to me.

Putting in characters with one variation would surely mess all that up? 




 I was thinking maybe the 111 meant a November the 11th release date perhaps why not.  




 Not better people, just people that can do their job without resorting childish insults. I don't know, it just looks like something you'd find happening on a primary school playground.  




 )

Found it. 




 This is why I stay out of politics. They're all so childish. It's crazy to see how juvenile the people who run the country are in the house of commons. 




 Here you go, friend.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/388f2p/in_paypals_new_terms_of_service_effective_july_1/crtygac?context=3 




 Sorry! Fixed.  




 Then they can stop asking for it.  




 But the terms of the contract are that they can spam you, if you close your account you're ending the contract so it should void their ability to spam, right? 




 I'd be willing to bet that if you close your account and therefore end any contract between you and them they can't legally spam you. 




 Good job I made mine years ago then. 




 I'll use an xray at the end of a combo if I can. 




 I agree. With Tanya she has a fatality where she stomps through their midsection and creates a hole just like the one Scorpion's fireball fatality does. Then she stomps through their face and leaves a hole identical to the one Jacqui leaves when she punches through. When Jacqui does that you can see some embers on the inside of the enemy's head, presumably because she used some kind of shot to boost the attack (gunpowder scorches?).

But when Tanya stomps through their face you can also see embers/orange glowing. Just makes it feel a little lazy when you see so many repeated gore effects. 




  but I think everyone goes "How would that not kill you?!"

Yeah I hear that a lot. I have to remind them that 75% of ALL moves in MKX would probably kill you. 




 I prefer the current one he employs. It's the most cinematic one by far, the way they fly up the camera, the clouds, the crazy electrical discharge coming from Raiden, it's so badass. 




 And the second I start getting that shit form them I'm shutting my account down. 




 Good point well presented. 




 You'd think so. I imagine very specific lighting is required for the illusion to work. 




 How little we've actually advanced. 




 What makes you think it's anything like Bordrlands? Other than it being first person with guns of course.

I think it'll play a lot like Fallout 3. I like to look at it like this. Skyrim made improvements over Oblivion in almost every aspect but sill retained the essence (IMO), I think Fallout 4 will be to Fallout 3 what Skyrim was to Oblivion. 




 [This one](http://static2.uk.businessinsider.com/image/556df97edd089502528b45d2-800-600/illusion-2.jpg) is simple yet effective.

But [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORoTCBrCKIQ) remains a mind fuck to this day. Wow the human senses are so easily fooled. 




 The Catholic Church. They can do whatever the fuck they want, including facilitating child rape, and get away with it. 




 They just have no fucking concept of health and safety laws over there. 




 This is one remaster collection I'm willing to buy.

I bought the first game (just before the third one was released) and it was better than I thought. I initially thought it looked kind of shitty to be honest, like a poor man's Tomb Raider.

Never got around to playing the others, this would be good to have before the release of the 4th one, which I plan on buying. 




 I remember this happening a while back. People were saying she was drunk or high on her meds or something, and that the guy shouldn't be goading on. he's fishing for a reaction. Sure she's the crazy bitch, but he wasn't helping the situation.

I think everyone's favourite part was when she called him an atheist muslim. 




 As long as I can still somehow connect to the internet I'd show them my phone.

And I'd be burned at the stake.

 Fine I'll say it!! Awwwwwwwww 




 I thought the default response to this image was "I ain't got no panties on!" 




 The ability to not be cuntish to one another. 




 I read the title as "Capybara Enjoying Butt Snakes in the Park".

I was expecting something... different. 




 I think the default respsone to these questions is to mix it in with bowls of muesli. 




 This advert was the first time I heard this song, and I like it. It just keeps elevating as it goes on.

 I figured you'd have known from the stereotype. It's a stereotype of British people, I'm English.

 "Let nobody stand in your way! Just..." **pushes closed fingers into the middle of the palm of the opposite hand, like reverse picking a pear** "...do it!" 




 When I clicked and read the text in the image it was like looking into my own mind from a third person perspective.

I... my...

**Critical hit. Head crippled** 




 There's a really fine line between bravery and stupidity. The only distinguishing factor between the two is success. 




 If you're terrified of death you should probably not be in the army lol. Seriously. It would be like being an arachnologist while have arachnophpbia.

I think you either need to come to terms with the notion of death or change career. 




 Tipping isn't weird, expecting a tip is weird. We understand that American employers like to (and are allowed to) pay their staff fuck-all under the premise that the tips will make their wage fair.

Over here our waiters/waitresses are paid properly so tips are literally nothing more than a bonus. For this reason most people (myself included) only tip when they feel they received service that went above and beyond merely taking my order and bringing me my food. if the waiter/waitress goes out of their way to make my dining experience as enjoyable as reasonably possible I'll leave a tip. Fuck up my order? Any chance of a tip goes out the window.

I should clarify, if I'm in America I'll tip because I understand that it's expected over there. On the flip side, Americans are always welcomed by waiting staff over here because their tipping habits make them seem extremely generous :) 




 We all have terrible teeth.

To be fair, I kind of support this stereotype. Due to years of eating too much junk food, drinking too many fizzy drinks, and smoking, my teeth aren't yellow, but they're far form bright white.

Also when I was much younger I nearly got braces but complained my way out of it. I wish I'd had braces, my teeth aren't all sorts of fucked up, but they could be more aligned. 




 Didn't you know? Outdoor Hoga is all the rage right now. 




 Acting seriously is relatively easier than being funny. 




 This was on the front page all day yesterday.

I checked out my paypal account (I hardly use it but it's good for the occasional online purchase). Luckily I never gave them my mobile number, for reasons just like this. This is why google and youtube will also never receive my phone number.

Edit: closed off that pesky parenthesis.  




 So... basically " Make your dreams come true! DO IT!!!" 




 Because it's 08:10am and I have a job. 




 I brushed my teeth this morning.

Entirely believable, but a lie nonetheless. 




 So the marketing worked on you. Money well spent. 




 Uh... I think you took a wrong turn at Albuquerque, we're not Imgur. 




 I'm on reddit daily and I can say today was the first time I've seen it. You should take the Stan Lee approach to reddit posts.

Every post is someone's first time seeing it. 




 I don't think it's unreasonable to get at least 1 alternate costume for characters you have to pay extra for. The fact that Goro, Jason, and Tanya only have one costume each has disappointed me. 




 I think you may be right lol.  




 To all the people saying it looks last gen. Go play fallout 3 on a console and then realise how foolish those words are.  




 So... there's a vault dweller... and he has a dog.

Could this be a true sequel? Playing as your character from last gen with dog meat in tow? Probably not, but the end of the trailer was too similar to the end of Fallout 3 to be coincidence right?

RIGHT? 




 All I can see is the please stand by message. 




  a play through with no commentary on youtube.

I actually made that for the main game a couple of years back. Yeah, I guess the story is the main draw, might as well watch it. 




 Depends on how much weight you want to lose, how quickly your body produces sperm, and how often you can offload it.

So 39. 




 Oh shit, I don't think  ican top this.

Pack it up guys, /u/ButtwadsMcGee94 just won. 




 If you were replying to someone called Vulpes Inculta I'm pretty sure they'd be just as excited as you for this news. 




 But Ronald McDonald killing something with a shotgun, so it balances out. 




 Women are required to wear a hijab, men are not. What's that if not sexist? 




 Long story short I have 8 in my PSN wallet and Left Behind is 7.99. I loved playing The Last Of Us on PS3 once, tried a second playthrough but didn't really feel it. How does Left Behind stack up against the full game?

Is it horse armour or The Ballad of Gay Tony? 




 Saw it yesterday on reddit. 




 This is as bad as my friend when he said the reason sunsets are orange is BECAUSE THE SUN LITERALLY GOES ORANGE AS IT SETS.

It was incredibly easy to explain to him that this cannot be the case, and then gave him the real explanation. 




 When I dabbled with reptile I just used L1 instead of pressing 1+3. Worked every time. 




 So I was right to say yes? 




 Not the most American thing I've seen, but it's too awesome to not post here. And I'm English.

 Unfortunately the real reason she wears it is probably more sinister i.e. Sexism

Edit: disregard, it was a stupid thing to say.  




 Sub-Zero: Started with Unbreakable (love that ice mask) but soon realised Grand Master is simply a better Unbreakable. So I ues Grand master, because that's the one  perform the best with.

Takeda: Shirai Ryu. Because that's the one  perform the best with.

Jacqui Briggs: Full-auto. Because that's the one  perform the best with.

Goro: Shokan Warrior. Because that's the one  perform the best with.

Tanya: Kobu Justsu. Beca... you get the idea. 




 You said exactly what I was about to say. Thanks for saving me the time. 




 Nope. My atheism is the result of simply not being convinced that a god exists. 




 I feel it applies everywhere, lol. 




 You sound like you know more about this subject than I do, so I'm just going to say yes. 




 I understand there's an audience that loves screaming in videos, but it gives me insta-rage sometimes. It's like "THE LOUDER I BE THE FUNNIER I IS!" 




 My head is crippled. 




 Got to throw those pesky file diggers off the trail somehow! 




 Fallout was never Skyrim with guns, it was Oblivion with guns. At this stage I wouldn't even want Skyrim with guns. Skyrim is my favourite game but man does it fucking look old now.

On newer, more powerful consoles we should get a game built from the ground up, not just some high res PS3 game. 




  I'm going to admit that it could potentially work if done right. But I'd rather have co-op.

I think this is what every Elder Scrolls/Fallout fan wants. 




 Are there planets in the sky in Skyrim? I thought it was just the moons, Masser and Secunda. 




  Eventually, someone made it through.

Master of exposition right here. 




 I said it 3 years ago and I'll say it now. I think TESVI will be in Elsweyr. We've had games set in the land of men and elves, but I don't think we've had one in a beastfolk land. Plus Elsweyr is mentioned in Skyrim in much more detail than any other province.
