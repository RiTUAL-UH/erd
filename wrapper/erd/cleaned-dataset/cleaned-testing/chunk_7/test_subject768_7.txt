 Yep :C

 Yeah 




 I really want to play JC2, so I downloaded it again, and fired it up, max settings, max resolution, decals off, 122FPS, but it crashes randomly?! Any fixes for this? I have AMD A10 7700K CPU, with a Sapphire R9 270X OC edition 4GB  




 I was thinking about getting a Assassins Creed game, since iv'e never played one before, anyone here with any experience? Is it good or bad? Is it capped at 30? What is all this hype about? What game should I play first? 




 Give me a clue! Give me a clue! Give me a clue, or we will butcher you! :)
