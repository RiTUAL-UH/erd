 Probably because they were told to by their parents, or the insurance company told them that they can get a discount if they do. 




 I haven't driven distracted since I was 19, and drove my car into a 12 foot deep ditch because I was trying to read my mail while driving down the road.  My car was undamaged, but a 2 ton truck Avista had to pull me out.  Good thing I knew Gravy or that would have been a hell of a tow bill.  I don't text and drive, or use my phone and drive.  The most I'll "read" while driving down the road is printed off instructions on how to get where I'm going.  And I do that at red lights.  (what's going to happen there?  They'll honk at me to tell me the light's green now?) 

















































 I grew up, and I don't want a speeding ticket, excessive display of horsepower, racing, and reckless driving charges.  Also, speed kills.  Want to race?  Go to the track. 




 Don't forget Fahrenheit 451. 




 One Second After really highlighted how dependent we are on electrical services for modern society, and just how fragile it is.

A History of God showed how all religion is a sham, and how I've been lied to all of my life. about it. 














 For the same reason I don't believe in underpants gnomes, god, or leprechauns. 



















 Pullman is a pretty safe city.  Break-ins and HIR's are very rare here.  I accidently left my keys in the ignition, and all 4 windows down in my truck yesterday at Sunnyside park, and my truck was still there exactly how I left it when I returned 5 hours later. 




 A religiidiot would say something on the order o*f "They haven't reached the age of accountability yet, so they get a free pass"*, or something like *"But it's a metaphor, as we're all God's children!"* 




 So an archaic of "to".  That's almost as bad; Jesus wants to watch kids jack off. 




 Jesus was a paedophile into bukakke, and he promised that kids who ejaculate upon him eternal life in the kingdom of god.

" But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven."

--Matthew 19:14 (KJV) 



















 Well, I wasn't really allowwed to as a youth, so when I became an adult, I just got used to being alone.  I only really go 3 places.  the store, work, and home.  If I'm not at one place, I'm likely at home.  Also 32 years old is too old to start to get into the social scene, (especially when I really have no interest in meatspace interaction)

Another thing, I've never been searched for drugs.  Besides MJ is legal here in WA. 




 how the hell can you tell that by internet?  Yeah, it's plainly obvious when I go to the park and can do a duck call well enough to get ducks over to my area without even a duck call just using my mouth, or when I bark back at dogs, and get into a barking competition with them, and I greet random cats on the street by trilling at them and slowly blinking at them, but how the hell can you tell that by text?

And I doubt 20% of any group is corrupt.  Unless you're in Mexico, that is.  Or basically ALL of the national media in the USA, (and most local sources). 














 Funny gross shit like Jackass 1 and 2, not disgusting for the sake of being disgusting. a dude taking a shit in a toilet store is gross and funny.  Drinking a whole bottle of Syrup of ipecac and puking to the screen is just disgusting. 




 LOL @ that.  They already are. :D They are a NFA Destructive Device. :)  But probably.  The media doesn't know shit from shinola about weaponry and the laws governing it.  Hell, they call a 10/22 with an extended magazine an "assault weapon with a banana clip". 




 No shit, but how would the news media react?  How would the american population react if somebody pulled up to them, and fired light artillery at the WBC and drove off? 




 I didn't they said "less than $10".  Purchased?  lighters.  I can't live wthout fire.  I always have one on me (or 4). 




 Jackass 3D.  It was so bad, that even though I pirated it, it wasn't worth my time.  I lasted 45 minutes, turned it off, and deleted it from my HDD.  I'm never watching it again.  It wasn't funny, it was just disgusting. 




 Air.  Price $0  Value:  Priceless. 




 Because "being who I am" really has succeeded so far in getting me dates, right?  It's not like I'm going to make strange sex jokes in public places, say "hey watch this", and deep throat a foot long hotdog just to freak people out, and randomly blurb out "Kitty hat, kitty hat, Kitty hat hat!" in public.  The men in the white coats would come, and haul me off to the looney bin. 




 Changing out an alternator in the dark sucks along with new wires because they fried, and a new battery because you drained it dead, and are now driving home with parking lights for 30 miles SUCKS ASS! 




 If that was considered a felony, I would get the chair.  Yes, I'm guilty of that. 




 Done. :)  Thanks for the unofficial warning. :) 




 With what?  My "environmental hazard" known as my truck.  I already know I need a new radiator, and coolant hoses, and a new front bumper, and a new WWF resivoir.  Yes, I drive a rolling superfund site.  (I got into a collisoin in 2011, and I've been driving it). 




 ..... Give them a gay parade...... :) 




 OK, what if the lady offered a BJ or whatever, and the dude said, "What are you, some kind of pervert?  I just want a date with a movie and dinner, pretend to enjoy my company is all I ask, not a blowjob or a handjob.  Does this look like the plot of FMJ?!  $150/hr lady.  Take it or leave it!"

**edit:**  For that much money, I would pretend to be gay, but the most "sexual contact" that would ever ever happen is holding hands, and even then I'm wearing sun glasses so I can't easily be IDed as a "queer"  (word spreads fast around town, and I don't want to be known as a "queer".  Oh god, dudes hitting on me, no thanks shudders.  There's a VERY significant difference between tolerance, (I tolerate whining kids on the aeroplane); acceptance, ( I accept the fact that global climate change may be influenced by mankind), and celebration, I celebrate the 4th of july with explosives that are legal only only 3 days out of the year).

I accept homosexuals, (just like you and me), but am I going to ever applaud butt-fucking as the superbowl sunday show [if it ever happened], NO!  I don't care if it was a dude-dude, chick-dude, or chick-chick.  I'd rather watch a literal monkey fucking a football than that, (and I would still change the channel) 




 OK, I'm starting to think that these escort services like I treat "designer drugs".  Yeah, they're legal, but can fuck your life up?  I won't touch "designer drugs" with a 12 foot pole, (and I have one), because I had to sit through my neighbor pounding on my door at 0200 because he thought he was going to die.  That was enough to scare me off of that idea.  Fuck "designer drugs".  He refused the ambulance several times even though he was scared shitless.  I went to sleep before he did, but when I woke up the next "day", (all of 1.5 hrs later)  I rolled him over with my foot and said "hey, still alive?"  He grumbled and asked "where am I?"  I told him the address and said "you're alive.  Go home.  Whatever you did, don't do it again"  

You can stay here until 1200, then I expect you to make the journey back home of all of 20 feet"  He said "20 feet?"  can you help me to my couch?  I said "not a problem.  Where's your keys?"  He said  "I have keys?"  I said, "Umm let me check your house".  it was unlocked, so I just opened up the door as wide as it would go, and went and got him.  I lied and told him, "you left them in the lock, your house is open, I'll take you home."  He agreed, so I plopped him on his couch, locked the door behind me, and went to work. Dumbass high guy from Lithuania.  I should have called an ambulance.

Still, he refused medical treatment, so from my understanding there's nothing I can do.  I must have asked him 15 or 16 times if he wanted to go to the hospital.  He kept on refusing treatment, so from what I remembered from first aid training, I couldn't do anything until he went unconscious, (but I did first because of being tired).

**TL;DR;**  Fuck designer drugs.  I had one scare with that shit, that's enough for me.. 




 "no mommy, I'll be good girl and lay on the bed with daddy!" 









 Rich dudes that are lonely, and people on craigslist? 



















 So, I guess it takes a ELI:Sociologist, not ELI5?  Can't say for the cat, but for the dog, I think you got it. 




 OK, what led person A to be like a dog with his former HS bully, and even a look could send person A cowering and curling up in the corner of the bus seat because she had a beef that wasn't with him because she might see him? And if she happened to sit next to him, he was shaking uncontrollably and try to make himself as small as possible, (fuc getting hit, she hits hard), (almost deathly afraid of a chick none the less), but other cats she tried that with fought back, even though it was futile? 




 Only after I get it from a choice of prime cuts at the local cannibal shop. :D 




 OK, among the beaten, why are some people like a dog being punished, (lowered head and make it obvious that they're sorry, trying not go get hit again), but others are like a scared cat, (they know they can't win, but they call names and such, and threaten to fight even though the older and bigger cat can obviously win)?  Is it just because they go with they know what works and will give them the least harm?   




 There is danger in either circumstance.  It's either "Hit me as much as you want, just please don't kill me" or "fine, kill me.  Just end it".

**DO NOT SHOW KIDS THESE MOVIES!!** 














 I don't mean the fireworks. 




 Sweet!  If I ever be rich, I'm hiring one.   Hey, maybe if I hire the same chick enough, she might begin to like me, and will date without pay?  THat would be awesome.  Like jumping off of Granite point, or going fishing, or camping for a night (in separate tents), or shooting, or eating lunch down by the river.  Hell if I know. 




 "Can you smile like a donut?"

"Yes"

"Show me"

guy does it

"You're hired!" 




 god damn it.  I aint rich, so I guess I'll piss that idea off. 




 Where does one find them? 




 I've tried.  It didn't work.  Now I just go to the bar once or twice a year because I miss people to argue football with, not for chicks.  I gave that up in 2004, (the year I turned 21).  I'm too old to hit on chicks at a bar.  City-data.com backs me up.  Look up Pullman WA. 




 I honestly don't know how.  I've tried bars, I've tried work, I've tried old FB friends that I used to know 20 years ago.  Got shot down at every one of them.  I know of "why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free", but I can't seem to find any cattle around here, and this steer, (i've had a vasectomy, so keeping with the analogy), still misses the company of a cow.  (and I don't mean fat chicks either). 




 My dad cut me off in 1999 because I was using too much of his internet time and hogging the phone line, so I ran my own line, and blueboxed an open frequency, and slam dialed every ISP in the Union to get a connection, and started dialing.  I eventually got through to an ISP in Topeka, KS, and I was caught in 2 hours because I only wanted free internet access without tying up my dads phone line.  (I stopped blue boxing, but I kept the phone line).   Everything about what I did was completely illegal, but I was  16 at the time, (I think that's the only reason they let it go, and I convinced them that I had no clue what was going on.)  My dad knew exactly what was going on.  He opened up the camper and said "XXXXXX, you need to take this call NOW.  It's the FBI!"  I knew exactly why I was getting the call.  Not doing that again.  (OK, I was cracking, not hacking).  But I didn't do it for commercial purposes, just "I want free internet".  (defrauding a public utility).  Yes, I kept the phone line, and now my home ranch has 2 lines. :) ) 




 Sweet. :)  Now to get rich enough to actually do it.  Doing it the old fashioned way doesn't seem to work.  ( I mean actually getting them interested in you, not handjobs).  I tried to get somebody on a date from my FB contacts that I haven't seen for over 20 years, and I think I got shot down).  She's a good internet friend, and lives less than 2 miles away from me, but I just want to go have a picnic in the park, (and I don't mean oral sex), not bang her, and still I get shot down). 




 I doubt it, other than my DUI, the most "criminal" charges, I've ever had is a sheriff rolled up on me laying on the ground looking up at the moon.  He just told me to go home, and I can't lay down in public in parking lots, the street, or sidewalks..  (and he thought I was odd because I was looking at the moon in binoculars.  I think he thought I was a peeping tom or something.) 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TShlMkQnc

That's country. 




 I've never picked up a whore, and I don't intend to, the most I've thrown "caution to the wind", is seeing cleavage and a camel toe, and while driving almost lose control because I was "busy gawking at the chick in lingerie on the street".  it made me look twice.    Yes, I got stopped because they wondered why I was swerving.  They asked why I wasn't looking at the road, and I said "because an almost naked lady".  They just told me "In the future, watch where you're actually going, and don't oogle women.  You're free to go." 




 What's so hard to understand?  He broke down, and was trying to flag somebody down to take him to a petrol station, and I happened to walk out my door at the time, and saw he neded help, so I approached, and it turns out he ran out of gas.  I towed him back to work with my Blazer.  We've been hanging out at each other's houses and watching TV together, and we drink each other's beer. :)  He wants to take me fishing this summer, (if I tow, he doesn't have a hitch), and he's willing to pay for the gas to get to the river.  I got a job contact through him too. :) 




 Yeah, I guess what I'm asking is are escorts legal, (so long as no sex acts are even considered, they just want a "girlfriend" for the night, and nothing more.)  Somebody to pretend they like the dude, and go see a movie and dinner afterwards, then drop them off back at home, (or wherever). 




 Ah, that explains it, (I think), so if some dude just wanted a "date" without sexual contact, and was willing to pay for the time, they would tell the "john" to get lost? 




 Oh, I think Argentina is in the ATL TZ. :)  Would the undercover go for it, or shoot him down, (metaphorically)?
Im in PST, (but we still use DST).  So, you're 4 hours ahead of me. :) 




 Good point, in GMT, it's 0258.  You must be in Sydney or Brisbane. 




 Umm, I just want somebody else with the dude that I made friends with because I towed him back to work in the Avista truck because he broke down, (out of gas), and I've been over to his house several times, and he's came here several times.  I'm obviously not gay, I just want somebody to hang out with at home.  I sort of am since my wife and SIL left me.  I like having a clean house though. :) 




 Would a regular whore do it?  (after all, they just want money; and they don't care if the dude paid them $150/hr to watch TV, or give them a BJ).  (No, I'm not going to pick up a whore to watch TV with me, [or do anything else, I kind of like not being HIV positive); I have a dude friend I can do that with). 




 Myself?  What type of question is this? 




 Yes, it did. 




 Uhh, the last time I tried that, I got a call from some local ISP and ATT because I was getting free internet access out of Tepoka, Kansas.  They told me to check my phone lines.  I'm not doing that again. O.o  That was embarrassing to get called in from the camper to the house from my dad. O.o  They almost made it a federal investigation.  I've stopped doing that. 




 No. 




 Don't want to.  Social interaction IRL is draining. 




 Maybe 1 or 2 friends, (and I made one the other day), but beyond that, nope.  I don't like going out.  "hanging out" without purpose is a waste of time. 




 How so?  Yes, you can trip out to classical music, (on salvia), but not on bluegrass.   Classic rock is the best, IMHO, but I have nothing against most genres of music, (except pop teeny bopper shit). 




 Around here, my best chances for a decent paying job are working the family ranch, and working harvest when it comes up.  Short of that, it's PRH, WSU, or SEL.  Other than that, everybody pays minimum wage.

(yay pullman...) 




 Would the undercover go for it, or shoot him down, (metaphorically)?  $150/hr of pay to pretend to enjoy an evening isn't a crime. (at least as far as I know).
 




 Would the undercover go for it, or shoot him down, (metaphorically)?

**EDIT:**  Shit, I meant an evening, not one hour.  That wouldn't even be enough time for dinner. 




 Breakfast at 1914hrs?  Do you work a night shift? 




 I've only been to one party in my life, and I didn't have fun. 




 My 3 bdrm 2 bath house with 2 designated parking spots is a basement now?  What's the main level?  That $650000 house across town? 




 I have no interest in gaming, and there's no LUG around here for adults. 




 Temporarily, nope.  I do work back home on the family ranch for money, and it's the best money I've eber made at $11.77/hr.  I wish I could get hired full time, I'd make about 1975/mo, and I would be living with no problems. 




 Pretty much! :D 




 I agree with the fans, most are a bunch of rhinestone cowboys, (or all hat and not cattle), but the music itself is decent.  And it's not like country has a monopoly on monotonous themes.  

Ever heard a rap song?  It's about how much life in the ghetto sucks, (to get down to it), pimps, drugs, "hoes", or shooting cops, or other black people, and the N-word is used a lot, or shooting up who knows what.  

Rock is "drugs, sex, and rock and roll"

Classic Music is mostly about God and Nature, and war stories.

Country is about pickup trucks, God, TV, 9/11, America Is Best, Hard Working men, Urbanization, etc.

Death metal is about being pissed off.

Classic rock (like pink floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon, or "The Wall"), is mostly a life story, but also drugs, sex, and rock and roll.

Blues is how much life sucks, regardless of where you are from

Bluegrass?  I haven't figured out that one yet.

Pop music?  I love a dude, and he doesn't love me back.  I just want to dance, etc. 









 Being a bully up until the 7th grade, calming down for 2 years, then having the tables reversed on my by the females in my class.  Yes, I deserved it, but I wish I wouldn't have done it in the first place.

 I don't think they do think it out, just pulling something out of my ass, but if I wanted to kill EMS workers, I'd report a false fire, (or start one in a skip), report it, and have trip wires on pipe bombs, and shoot mortars (the fireworks ones) at them.  That would actually cause a fire, and severely maim (or kill) whoever tripped the wire.

No, I have no intention of doing that.  I don't have a beef with anybody.  So burning your own house down and sitting there with an AK makes no sense at all. 




 That's fucked up.  O.o  They don't think this shit out, do they? 




 That's fucked up.  People wire their house to blow up?  What the hell?  And what the fuck is wrong with the dude that stayed in his house after it got torched.  Fire = get the hell out.  I don't care whether it's the cops, or the neighbor pounding on my door in that circumstance.  I'll go investigate, then get the fuck out.  I was in a house fire in 2001, and ran outside with no pants on to see how bad it was.  Wasn't too bad, so I went back inside and put pants on.  By the time I got out again (maybe 30 seconds), the entire upstairs was engulfed. 




 OK, that explains doors that are solid, but why for doors that have a viewing window?  Couldn't the person just look out and fire in that direction? (like the house that got the door knocked on)? 




 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement#Theories

Legislated to give the freed black slaves after the Civil War rights comparable to the unalienable constitutional rights of white state citizens. The benefits of U.S. citizenship are received by consent in exchange for freedom. State citizens consequently take steps to revoke and rescind their U.S. citizenship and reassert their de jure common-law state Feucitizen status. This involves removing one's self from federal jurisdiction and relinquishing any evidence of consent to U.S. citizenship, such as a Social Security number, driver's license, car registration, use of ZIP codes, marriage license, voter registration, and birth certificate. Also included is refusal to pay state and federal income taxes because citizens not under U.S. jurisdiction are not required to pay them. Only residents (resident aliens) of the states, not its citizens, are income-taxable, state citizens argue. And as a state citizen land owner, one can bring forward the original land patent and file it with the county for absolute or allodial property rights. Such allodial ownership is held "without recognizing any superior to whom any duty is due on account thereof" (Black's Law Dictionary). Superiors include those who levy property taxes or who hold mortgages or liens against the property.[14]

Yep, it sounds like they think they are their own nation state.  That's fucked up man. 




 Wouldn't the door actually be better?  After all, I can punch through the wall, (if it's sheetrock), but there's no way in hell I could punch through a metal door. 




 WTF is a sovereign citizen?  People think they are their own nation-states? 




 I was having a beer in my front lawn looking around to "see what I can see", and I saw an officer go up to a neighbor's house, and stand to the side of the door and knock, and then wait.  Why? 




 Most shootings occur with gang-on-gang violence, and they're not supposed to have them in the first place.  It's already illegal to either supply felons with weapons, be a felon in a possession of a weapon, or do straw man purchases, or modify firearms to be automatic, or to alter the serial number, or import without a VERY thorough investigation, or a whole lot of other shit. (See 18 USC Section 922 for further details.  Yes, subsection (r), is pumb fucking stupid, but the law is the law.) 




 No, people shouldn't be forced to carry a weapon if they don't want to, (or don't know how to use it, then they shouldn't).  I'm just saying that "GUN FREE" = "Victim disarmament".  Gun control only disarms the people who are willing to stay within the law, not the criminal element.  When is the last time you heard of somebody holding a gun to somebody's head with the express intent of killing them, only to say "wait, murder is illegal, I better not do it or I'll go to prison"?  Never.

But if people had a chance to shoot back, these mass murders wouldn't happen.  I agree with you completely on the lack of professional journalism in the USA.  That's why I watch BBC, and listen to France24.  The only time I even am exposed to American "Journalism" is in my truck, and I keep it tuned to KQQQ and KQZB. 




 Yes, and he got a $6.1M "reward" in civil court for it.  IMHO, Janet Reno should be locked up in ADX Florence for the crimes she allowed to perpetuate under her leadership.  Also, The government has this thing called "sovereign immunity".  You can't criminally prosecute the government, {or even sue them}, (except under extreme situations). 




 I think it's Putin.  He wants to reestablish the USSR, and the dude is on a power trip wanting to destroy the world. 




 Who said anything about race?  If I hire somebody to go kill person XXX, that's organized crime, but if I just go shoot up a house because I suspect person XXX might be there, (or I want to intimidate his family, [or his neighbors, etc]), then I would be a thug. 




 Ruby Ridge.  They shot his pregnant wife, and even killed his dog. 




 Kazakhstan?  




 You're right and wrong.  I have no clue about military history with bands, (why I'm asking), but do want to learn why using such tactics that could get your ass blown to hell and back were employed at all, (why I'm asking). 




 Every state in the union "right to carry", and "shall-issue".  Just think, what if in that church, What if one person was armed and could shoot back?

For the sake of argument, let's say he's not combat trained, and hits 2 or 3 people firing blindly in the dark before stopping the intruder?

How many people would have been saved? 23. (discounting the assailant). 




 Given the choice of being governed by the baboons in WDC, or the local mafia, I choose the mafia.  Protection money is cheaper than taxes.  If the government burns your house down because you won't pay, it's "tax collection".  If the mafia does, it's arson.  The government is lauded, the mafia is despised. 




 The government is legal. 




 I guess they didn't get much mail then.  I wouldn't bother either.  I do like Maxim magazine while on the john though, so I'd go in once a month at least. 




 You mean like the government?

What's the difference between the mafia and the government?

The government is legal. 




 90 




 holy shit!  Did they have an entire mail bag waiting for them? O.o 




 OK, hopefully we never get nuked so I don't have to use it.  That would really suck. 




 That explains how it works!  Thanks!  But how do they know if they got mail or not?  Do they have to ride into town once a week or something? 




 Nah, thugs shoot up anybody they can.  The mafia only targets men that have a beef with them.  They're a racketeering organization, and a criminal influence, not a thug. 




 The only reason I know about it is from NWSS.  If your nation gets nuked, the mail won't operate like it has since the mid 1800's.  You have to collect your mail at the post office, and stand in a queue to get it.  But how do you know if you even got mail that day, and you didn't walk to the post office for no reason? (or hitch up your horse and ride into town for no reason)?

 Thinking about that mule eating on a literal pile of shit, and my dad's reaction to seeing it driving down the road. He almost vomited in the truck, and I had to steer because he was busy puking out the window. :D 









 Actually, yes. I'm playing off of Jesus/Hey-Zeus. :) 




 Do the triple S. I didn't see anything. 




 Mormon knocks at the door of somebody harboring an illegal alien.

Mormon asks the landholder: "Have you found Jesus?"

Landholder says: "Do you have a warrant?" 




 OK, I know it's hollywood, but why in the movies, is there a drum roll right before firing off the cannon?  I could see that working **ONCE** as a signal, but then the enemy will figure out what it means, and just shoot at the drummers.  (no music, no commands). 




 No, "Limies" refer to the UK soldiers.  And yes, limes are an excellent solution to Scurvy, (high in acidity, so don't need to keep chilled, and they don't rot for a long time if kept in the bellows of the ship where it's reasonably cool enough like a cellar). 




 Because "find title" didn't work, and it's still basically the same title. 
























 Just nab it in the first year. After that, you can use it until the sun blows up if you want to.  

**EDIT:**  (Please don't use it for the next 5 billion years). 




 Fuck shooting my 590 indoors, I've already experienced that when I was 8 when my dad had an ND.  I thought he offed himself and ran to his bedroom crying because I thought he killed himself with a 7MM magnum).

But why music instead of the sergeant with a bullhorn? 




 No shit it didn't exist, but why a band instead of a bullhorn with the sergeant?  Bullhorns have existed since forever.  It's called a large funnel with the end chopped off.  Or cup your hands around your mouth and yell.

**EDIT:**  FFS, I could use a traffic cone as a bullhorn if I really wanted to. 




 I think I prefer radios. and APCs, and air support.  Fuck the band.

**EDIT** Wait, is that why watching old movies about the civil war or the war of independence, the music changes when actively engaged in combat? 




 We still do here in Pullman.  We play the Marine corps, the air force, and the army hymns.  This is basically our play list in Pullman:

I'm just glad that that song "put a boot in your ass" finally died.  It's broadcast live on KHTR. :)

 




 Yes, they do make noise no matter how much they are trying to be quiet.  So I guess thank god for automobiles, hovercraft, the SEALS, and air support with helo lift? 




 Before the 1700's?  America was too busy being a British colony. 




 *cough* different frequencies between a 10M radio and a walkie-talkie *cough* 




 That explains it! :)  Thanks. :) 









 So they used music like I use a radio?  I think I'll stick with the radio, thanks. 




 America:  We invented "guerrilla warfare"  While you dumbass limies were lined up making an easy target for us, we had trees. :)  Shoot and move. :) 



















 *cough* Windows ME *cough* 




 Why do you target NA?  And have you **really** met anybody in NA that hasn't heard of Jesus?  Where did you find them?  Living in a tree?   




 I'm a dude. 




 Where your driver's license says you're from, and if an immigrant, where you are authorized to stay on a permanent basis. 




 I actually can, and no, I don't (much).

Also, /r/autofellatio 




 I think Ill remain a lone wolf watching CNN having should be in bed about 8 hours ago.
