 how many minuets? 




 Im 16 but I think I start watching around 12 or 13. 




 She her manager or rather manager for FPS Russia and she just lives with him. She's more of a friend really. 




 Did the same thing except I said "Attention Walmart shoppers. All items will be 90% percent off for the next 10 minutes. Thank you." And I watched the store turn from a place where civilians buy goods to a trackmeet of sorts in which people rushed through every isle half-jogging, grabbing what they could and sprinting to the cash register as the workers looked at each other in complete confusion. Some middle-aged man had watched me walk up, and me not wearing the typical walmart get-up...ya know the blue shirt with the khakis, and when I had finished my 'announcement' he looked me dead in the eyes while shaking his head and said "Some people just want to watch the world burn." And then he just walked away. 




 Margot Robbie 




 Mad Max. I don't want to watch 2 hours of nonsense with no story and if I wanted that then I'd go watch Transformers. 




 Fake it 'til you make it. Been my life motto. 




 Producing Music (Mainly hiphop and rnb instrumentals) 




 Every rendition of Mystique has been very unattractive IMHO. Margot Robbie would be good in the role but I like her as Harley Quinn more.  




 Filled the parking lot with sand and had a beach party...in the parking lot.

 Metta-World Peace 




 That I am a terrorist because I am indian and indians look muslim while obviously inferring that all muslim are terrorists. Nothing in this world is infinite except for human stupidity. 




 The Last Airbender. Did you see those CGI effects and that terrible plot. That shit was atrocious. 




 Ric Flair by Tory Lanez. I get hyped up.  




 Tootiesee Rolls. The brown little turds. Hate when that shit makes its way in to my basket on Halloween. 




 Having to to take the piss of a thousand gods when there is still 45 mintues left of a movie when you're at the theaters. (I was watching Ant-Man. Great Movie!) 




 12 year olds with iphone 6's when I damn near 17 with an ipod touch 




 Luckily, Denzel was there. 




 1984 and Lord of the Flies 




 No, no he IS talking about ballet. 




 Where you raised on a farm...cause you sure know how to raise this cock. 




 Simple...when you can fart openly in front of them. 




 Shawshank redemption, all terminators,all of the Lord of the Rings, shrek, harry potter, toy story, The Godfather, Schindler's List, Rambo, Rocky, Citizen Kane, inception, Titanic, Forrest Gump, ET, Silence of the lambs, Gladiator, Saving Private Ryan, Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, All indiana jones, Jaws, braveheart, Goodfellas, rain man, Good Will Hunting, etc. I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THESE BECAUSE NETFLIX'S SELECTION IS SHIT.

TL;DR: Never watched any classic/mainstream movie you can fathom that came out before before 2013. 




 Any classic movie because blockbuster is gone ;(  




 The Million Dollar Arm. 




 You might die before the two-weeks are up. 




 OoOok Charles 




 Kevin Hart's stand-up isn't that funny. Movies are funny af, but his stand up relies on yelling profusely and making funny faces. Didn't laugh once while watching a whole special. 




 I don't think she's hot. 




 I hated Mad Max: Fury Road. 




 I'm not a freak but how large of a volume is your load? Can we get a measurement in mili-liters. 




 Wyoming is irrelavent. 




 Scarystories to tell in the Dark. 




 How the universe could have been created. Whether it was God or the Big Bang (which I heard was disproven but idk) since you have to keep asking yourself how that God or the particle even came into existence and it just becomes a vicious loop. 




 The Dark Knight.
