 How do you feel about the current shit storm happening on /r/all? 




 The saxophone dear god, my girlfriend said she used to play saxophone and I made it very clear the benefits she'd receive if she played this for me. She still hasn't learned it so I guess my benefits aren't all that great.... Wait a minute. 




 LOLWUT 














 Blatt, slippin the ref $100 




 I was thinkin about taking it that route, but I didn't. I've wanted to shake Locke so many times during that show. 




 Rattle that lock. Not to be confused with Rattle that Locke (a goofy miniseries where the main character, John Locke, can't help but get in hilarious philosophical conundrums). I made that up, don't hurt me. 




 Roger has been waiting to release his album after David, waiting for the perfect opportunity to be slick 




 Yep I love the same things about it. Sober too. 




 Really? I've never heard anything off TFC, and of all songs why that one? TFC isn't very radio friendly, but theres a couple I'd pick before that haha 




 Oh geez, absolutely this. Impossible to listen to a Spotify/Pandora Pink Floyd radio station for this reason. 




 Definitely fits, is seems like it's just Part IV? If I'm not mistaken, I sometimes blur the parts together. 




 It wasn't preceded or followed with anything else off DSotM. It just felt awkard, but I was pumped when I heard it because I thought Time was gonna follow directly after, but never did. What other songs by PF just seem out of place or awkward when played out of context of the album? 




 Annie Wants A Baby 




 Their new album, I love Coldplay but their new album doesn't do anything for me. 




 As a Huge Pink Floyd fan, I'll have to admit that I really don't care for Money. 




 Their new album kinda grinds my gears. Their first two were immaculate albums, even though I didn't really like Truce as a closer. However, with blurryface, its just mehhhh at most of the times. 




 Holy shit man, Eddie Vedder was made to sing that rendition! 




 5 years ago, probably Phobia by Breaking Benjamin. To be honest my music listening has grown so exponentially over the past 5 years that Breaking Benjamin is just my best guess.

Today, probably Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd. Just an immaculate album.

 




 If Taylor Swift can see it, we can all see it. 




 Google "Band member name poster" I didn't have any issues. 




 21 and WYWH

WYWH was my first favorite "song" by them, and then gradually I got into the album that made me love the band in the first place.

Anyone ever see Lord's of Dogtown? 




 That's awesome! Love hearing PF stories across generations. 




 On An Island! And Amused To Death by Roger Waters is monumental 




 Be a chick with a rack and post a picture of you hugging a cute pet 




 Feynman 




 I would be shocked by Stephen Colbert's death. I wouldn't be shocked by David Hasselhoff's. 




 Pink Floyd. Bands can be a product, and I will forever throw money at whatever they do. Even their solo acts. 




 Great Gig In The Sky by Pink Floyd... shittt that'd be so dramatic 














 The most recent being deflategate. Watergate was name because it was the name of the hotel! The scandal wasn't Watergategate! 




 Christopher Walken lives in a WYWH style 




 Relax, lesbian. 




 Took me until your comment 




 Debatably the best instrumental they ever produced. Debatable, yes, but I think it's my favorite. Even though any colour you like is a great track as well. 




 I'm still a History Teacher fan boy! Can't wait to see him on stage next week! 




 Is there any public outcry about removing Le Graet in France? I'd genuinely like to know. 




 What about referees?  




 But a horse that is allergic to needles, obviously 




 New skin is Aerodactyl. Ya' know, the POKEMANS. Not really with how it looks, but you get the gist. Still missing Zapdos and Moltres. Guess we won't get Moltres until Riot finishes that Lava map that has been thrown away for ever. And Zapdos, here's where it gets real. Maybe if Kennen electricutes a prehistoric Anivia and it kills her, making her go into eggnivia, it will hatch as a beautiful Zapdos.

TL;DR People still think dreamily of Pokemon first generation 




 Two sentences, disqualified. Top notch banter though lad 




 You would be maxcheater if ya didn't haha 




 Awesome! I'll pass the message along to his brother (the way I actually know Chad) and I remember that story about your club! That's awesome! Have a great day. 




 I'm honored to say that I know this glorious man irl, and I've never really devoted my allegiances to any team except for now. Go get 'em Chadders! 




 I thought it was funny how the story has been around for about half the day, and it wasn't posted anywhere on reddit 









 An absolutely beautiful moment from TFC, such a good narrative and story telling 




 Yay someone who holds the title as "first player dismissed by coach K" and refused to be a team player as he pissed and moaned every practice. Take that and all your preseason hype and wait for that shit to crash and burn. 




 Rick Wright was responsible for so much of the Pink Floyd sound. Keyboardists do count! 




 Underwear? Men's or women's? 




 A lot of people on this sub spell his name wrong, so by the misspelling on "More" it seems like they're the same people. It's okay bud, we don't blame ya. 




 I think around the 18 minute mark in AHM 




 I'm not really into Wiz anymore, but a lot of my friends are since I go to school about an hour from Pittsburgh and I have some friends from Pittsburgh. Pitt is where Wiz is from, and this is more of an older Wiz song that I could actually enjoy, I consider this a pretty good Wiz song, but anything he's put out on the past 5 years or so, I won't listen to. 




 Twenty one pilots!! 




 All the conspiracy theorists coming up with theories about how Osama Bin Laden did coordinate 9/11 and not the US government. 









 along with Where Is the Love by Black Eyed Peas 




 I think it's barely about roger at all 




 Yep thats the one I watched! 




 Okayyyyyyyy surprised the nads off of me 




 Thanks! This seems incredible, I'm gonna give it a listen the next chance I get. 




 And I thought it was very well done. Can you guys recommend any other pink Floyd documentaries? Preferably free ones I can access on YouTube or elsewhere. 




 *ADDED: Besides Gold of course, you rascals. And also would you take the trade the item for the gold? 




 just in time 









 Take into account how elections are won these days. You gotta be likeable, good looking, and good social skills etc. the obvious answer is Not Blitzcrank ;p who would be in the presidential cabinet? Sona b/c boobs. 




 Doggerpillar 




 /r/politics 




 Yep! That's the song I recommend to people if they never heard of him 




 Badass enough to make women bystanders wet to their knees 




 Sooooo many Sage Francis lines could be posted in this thread, he's amazing 




 "Raped a pregnant bitch and told my friends we had a threesome" - Tyler, the Creator 




 "The virginity scarf" - twitch chat 2k15 




 One of the best PF instrumentals ever 




 Sage Francis, he used to be a slam poet and now is a killing it as a rapper with very angry lyrics. I recommend Slow Down Gandhi. 




 One of the best songs off the album  




 Currently my favorite track off Animals, used to be Dogs, but lately I've really enjoyed singing alongside Roger Waters as Rick so beautifully merges Rogers voice with synthesizers. Such a fun song. 




 Way to represent WVU, you fucko 




 What the fuck is hip hopera, people are just makin shit up anymore 




 You're right, I think while the Final Cut is unfavorable among most PF fans, I think it definitely has some great moments. Post-War Dream, Gunner's Dream, Southampton Dock, Final Cut, and Two Suns in the Sunset are my favorite from the album 




 * Atlantic City by Bruce Springsteen
* Old Man Time and Mr. Moon by O.A.R.
* Gunner's Dream by Pink Floyd
* Air Catcher by Twenty One Pilots
* Dead Sea by The Lumineers
* My Blood by Ellie Goulding
* Bankrupt on Selling by Modest Mouse
 




 That first guitar solo, I think it's around 3:45? Is my favorite solo off Animals 




 I've never listened to it while going to bed. I think that that's is most apt time 




 It's just never been my jam, David Gilmour was still learning how to make a cohesive Pink Floyd album without Roger. On The Turning Away is definitely the highlight off the album for me 




 No problem homie, echoes, fearless, and one of these days are the highlights for sure. I think on vinyl, echoes is the entire second half 




 All Pink Floyd albums except Ummagumma and A momentary lapse of reason 




 Echoes is a song off Meddle :p sorry I couldn't help myself, I'm on /r/pinkfloyd almost daily  




 Echoes is a song off of Meddle 




 Echoes is a song off of Meddle
