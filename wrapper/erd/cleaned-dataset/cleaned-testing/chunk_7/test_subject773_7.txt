 *sigh*...want. 




 Sadly I think he's too old.  I think they have an age limit for interns.  What I think I really need to find is someone who owns one privately, in a car collection or something.  Where to find that, I do not know. 




 Oh, hold me! 




 What glorious moss!!! 




 This professor is my adviser for my Master's thesis.  Today he told me that his lifelong dream was to drive the Oscar Meyer Wienermobile.  At the end of the semester, it is typical to give your adviser some sort of thank you gift (bottle of whine, gift card for a dinner out, etc). I say, screw the bottle of wine, I want him to be able to drive the Weinermobile!

Anyone know someone who has driven one, works for Oscar Meyer, etc?  Any leads would be great. 




 That's a pair of winners right there, sir. 




 I...love. 




 Why does it need to be a board game?  Isn't Apples to Apples just a card game as well? 




 It's only my best guess, but someone had to try it. 




 YO DE LAY HE, YO DE LAY HE, YO DE LAY HE YOOOOOOOOOO... 




 Who is it?  I want one!
 









 Hello fellow gardeners!  My boyfriend and I have a Minnesota garden, so while you're probably a bit colder than us, things are similar.  

1) This article is short and has a nice graphic showing which things to rotate from year to year, and how to make a rotational schedule.  As for things to plant next to each other, we don't have a ton of space, so we do things like grow beans up our sunflowers, and grow lettuce under our bean trellis.  We stage a lot of things such that by the time the larger plant leafs out and shades the smaller, earlier growing plan, the smaller plant is done producing.  As for things to plant, Charentais melons were small, and FANTASTICALLY tasty (seeds can be hard to find, but PM me and could mail you some we saved), and we had an amazing crop of tomatillos last year, which is great if you want to make a green salsa.  Another fun one that I haven't personally tried, but is good for our climate is the arctic kiwi.

2) We start tomatoes, peppers, zucchini, basil, and some greens indoors, though we start the greens indoors so we can have lettuce and kale early.  We also start another round of greens outdoors.  As for timing, SproutRobot is a nice tool.  You simply enter your zip code and it makes up a schedule for you, and can even send you email reminders and ship you seed, if you so choose.  http://sproutrobot.com/

3) We have gotten all our seeds from Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds and Seed Savers Exchange.  Now we don't buy seeds unless we want to try something new, because we have gotten good at seed saving, and our stock gives us more than enough seed.

4) We have raspberries that were in the yard when we bought the house.  Again, see the arctic kiwi.  As for fruit trees, you could graft some or buy some, but you're looking at about 5 years for them to start producing, so if you plan on moving, you may want to just wait.  Also, while it isn't really a "fruit" per se, we do a lot with rhubarb.

5)  Straw for mulch can be good, but we tried it one year and it seeded everywhere, which was super annoying.  We collect leaves from parts of our yard (and mulch the rest into the grass) and dump it all over the garden in fall.  Then in spring, we turn the leaves into the soil.  We also empty two compost bins full into the garden each year.  Our soil is very sandy, so we are working hard to get organic matter into the soil, and I'm not a soil amendment expert yet.  As for mulching to control weeds, when you mow your lawn, collect some of the clippings and use them as mulch in the garden.  We've had good luck with that.

6) If you have (or can find) an old window, it's easy to build a cold frame, and that can extend your season on either end by a few weeks.  Habitat for Humanity has ReStores where you can buy used and salvaged construction materials, and that might be a good place to look.  If you're looking for a good book that covers a lot of this stuff, The Backyard Homestead is fantastic.  

Hope this helps!!!  PM me if you need melon seeds! 




 More like DAT ALL OF HIM.  *grrrrrowlllll* 




 Cool!  What program(s) did you use for this? 




 I think a TC book club is wonderful!  I can't guarantee I'll be very available until May (I'm in the middle of my master's thesis), but I'm very interested in being involved.  I could plan meetings and find locations too.

I drive a lot, so I mostly listen to audiobooks these days.  Any books I sit down and read are for my thesis.  I work my way though a lot of young adult fiction, mostly because it's easy to follow while driving around the city.  I'm just working my way through N.D. Wilson's 100 Cupboards trilogy.  As far as adult fiction, I was an undergraduate English lit major, so I have a solid handle on that too. :)

I'll join this sub so I can stay connected.  I'd love to be a part of it.   




 The blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up...with the forearms...oh my. 




 What do you think about climate change?  Have you noticed changes in your lifetime that have shocked you?  How things looked when you grew up vs. now?  I'm doing my thesis on climate change and its impact on sense of place. 




 This was the stuff of nightmares in gym class.  The racquets were terrible. 




 I show in the Morgan circuit.  I started with Morgans as a kid, when I became interested in horses and a girl at school invited me over to her house to meet her horses, which were all Morgans.  From there, her mother directed my family to a nearby Morgan farm that gave lessons.  15 years later I'm still at the same barn!  I've also shown Saddlebred and Hackneys, but Morgans will always be my first love.  

It's hard to explain why I love Morgans so much more, but I feel like they have a certain spark to them.  So many of them have undeniable heart, and HUGE motors!  With both of my horses, you only have to say "whoa", never "go"!  They bring 110% to every ride.  Also, Morgans are smart -- sometimes too smart!  And of course they are beautiful!  As long as you don't need a big horse, they are the total package.   




 I'm so happy to know this is a thing!  I've tried to describe it to others as "being able to vibrate my eardrums", but now I really know what is going on in there! 




 Am I the only one attracted to OP?  Maybe minus the colander.   




 I miss Albert Heijn on a daily basis. 




 Can we clone him?
 




 There is a couple down the street that has horses on their property and regularly rides them around the neighborhood and adjacent parks. I would love to get to know them, and their horses, and see if they ever need help around their small barn when they are out of town, etc. What is the best way to go about introducing yourself? I don't want to just show up on their property -- that might be seen as trespassing. What do you suggest? Have you had people approach you on your land about your horses? How did they do it? And how did it make you feel?  I board my horses, so I don't have a good feel for what its like when someone approaches you about your horses on your own land. 




 For me it all began when a new girl came to my school in 4th grade.  She and I hit it off and she invited me to her horse show that weekend to meet her horse and watch her ride.  I'd never been to a horse show before, and was only familiar with western and jumping when it came to riding, but she had a Saddlebred and showed saddleseat, and I was instantly in love.  The following year, another girl joined our class who rode huntseat and had Morgans.  I really fell in love with her Morgan, and when I figured out that Morgans could do saddleseat, I pursued it.  My parents contacted a local trainer, and I'm still with him and his team of trainers 15 years later.  

I got my first horse when I was 14 and showed her as a saddleseat horse, but it turned out she wasn't really built for saddleseat and didn't enjoy it.  Not wanting to push her, we retired and bred her.  After she had her foal (my current show horse) we put her back to work and discovered she made a gorgeous hunter pleasure horse, so back to the show ring we went!  After a few years she retired for good and her son stepped up as my show partner.

In short, I've ridden and shown saddleseat, huntseat, and done driving with Morgans, Saddlebreds, and Hackney ponies for the past 15 years, and dabbled in bits of Dressage and Western.  At some point I would like to learn to jump!  Pictures here of my early saddleseat days (http://i.imgur.com/TQgw8.jpg), my mare as a hunter (http://i.imgur.com/jFVcm.jpg), her son as my current hunter (http://i.imgur.com/TVTI0.jpg) and one of the Hackneys I have shown in harness (http://i.imgur.com/Bl7yc.jpg)  Enjoy! 




 This week I am showing at the Grand National and World Championship Morgan Horse Show, and you can watch it live online!  This is a great opportunity to see some of the best Morgan horses in the world, and also to see some great saddleseat horses along with incredible hunter pleasure Morgans, and gorgeous western horses.  Comment if you have any questions about what you are watching!  

The show goes until this Saturday night and most of the "big" action will be happening in the Coliseum, so choose that feed from the options to the right of the video window.  Happy viewing! 









 Well I shouted it to the heavens on FB so that my Minneapolis friends will keep an eye out too.  I've been on your side of the music business before, and can't imagine losing everything you've had stolen. 




 I'll keep my eyes out as I'm around the neighborhood.  That seriously sucks, Ari.  I hope you can recover at least part of it.  Does your MacBook have any identifying marks on it?  Stickers/decals?  It would be easier to tell if someone using a suspicious MacBook. 




 I live in Minneapolis.  Not sure if you're coming anywhere near me, but if you are, my yard is your yard. 




 I had a Sudan Plated Lizard.  He lived for a long time, for a Sudan Plated, about 15 years.  He was always getting into trouble, like the time he got into the heating ducts. :) 




 I still have mine! 




 I want to hug him SO HARD. 




 Where are you located?  Are you able to grow all year, or does this merely extend your season.  I'm in MN, and our season is painfully short.  Cold frames only get us so far. 




 The amount of talent on Reddit (and in the world in general) never ceases to amaze me. 




 Really an amazing transformation.  You look fantastic! 




 He is everything I love in a man!  
 




 You went from poofy to ladyboner! 




 I'm looking for one extra ticket to the Sept. 29th Minneapolis Ben Folds Five show. Does anyone have one they can't use? There are some tickets left, but they are way in the back and I am a short, short person. PM me if you can help me out. Been a BFF fan since I was 15, and it would mean a lot to see these guys when they come to town. Many thanks!

 Can't see past the typo. 




 He's a keeper alright! 




 Where is it going to be located?  This is the first I've heard about it! 




 Now it's perfect.  And so dapper! 




 PIZZA-CORN! 




 Now he needs a monocle. 




 WANT!  Dammit and I was at the MN state fair too and didn't see these. 




 That will be an interesting look if she gets fat... 




 Nose Nachos is my personal favorite.  They should get rid of these hilarious names.  Hilarious names MAKE me want to try them.   




 I love this.  Now every time I use one of these I will imagine it saying "oooooeeeeeeeEEEEEE!!!!!" 




 Awesome! 




 Ohhhh...I had to come back to this one.  BAD TIME!  Riiiight... 




 SCIENCE!!! 




 It's a sugar rectangle, what's not to love? 




 You link doesn't work. :(  Just sends me to Google.
