 i'm really concerned about your mom hitting you. Do you have any other family members you can talk to that could help? Also, you should post this on /r/asktransgender, you'll most likely get more replies 







































 oh we're all pretty skanky 




 there, you now have 1000 




 you paged? 




 Going beyond the findings would be pure conjecture I would posit  that whatever they had previously experience gave them certain expectations of how a situation would unfold. So presented with a situation that would seem "normal" to us, say a trash bag lying beside the road, would be seen in a context that would be "normal" to them based on THEIR experiences, i.e. a concealed IED that would explode as their convoy drove past.  What would be non-threatening to you, a civilian, would be seen thru the lens of a soldier who has had multiple encounters in combat. 




 no, the study just confirms that the PTSD sufferers' perceptions of reality is different than those of people without the condition.  





































































 honestly viv, i dont have a clue, which is why i'm asking. 









 look, you're obviously angry about something, so i'm more than happy to hear you out, which is why i offered to take it to PM 




 that's what they said about gay marriage.... 




 actually i'm trying to use humor to defuse a situation.  
























 we talk to cedar all the time, and they're the nicest person. and besides, we like to save our mod abuse for when nobody is looking, then we bring out the sacrificial lamb and do the incantations to stay young forever more

MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

i have said too much.... 




 no, you didnt say it, i just find it's harder to stay mad when you say "poopyhead" in any context.

 









 discussions are always open, we just ask you to please refrain from personal attacks. we can have a grown up convo without having to resort to calling each other "poopyheads" 









 viv, please refrain from personal attacks. if you have any issues, please PM us and we'll have a discussion about your concerns. 










































































































































































































































 yeah, all they do for their headlines is to quote verbatim what was said..... and most of the time, it's batshit cray cray 









 they're actually pretty decent reporters on batshit insane positions that the bigots take 










































































 almost ALL my queer friends are in love with the show, all my straight friends are kinda "meh" about it.

just an observation. 





























 please be civil 











































































































































 i'm glad i posted it yesterday, if i had read that today from work, i'd be bawling 




 yeah, i know, all the feely feels 









 3 you dani! 



















 yeah, i know, i used to be an officer in 7BTS, so i used to do the intake interviews. 




 lmao, i'm trans and lesbian, and i still went thru NS fine, even became an officer.  




 i was a crazy person the first 6 months. then i was an emotional wreck for the next 6. i'm amazed that any of my friends stuck around. 2nd puberty is a royal bitch and a half. there were times i was so uncomfortable with my image in the  mirror that i spent days avoiding my reflection. without my therapist, i would have gone stark raving bonkers. it didnt help that i went fulltime 2 months into hrt. hell, i didnt start hrt til two months after i got my script. 

seriously, your reaction is pretty much well within the bounds of transition. keep a record for your timeline, you'll see the diff. 

 HUG 

hold on, i know it's rough, but you can do this.

 




 let's take it from the top, shall we?

someone's sexuality is literally none of your goddamn business. if they want to serve their country by joining up, then more power to them. YOU  do not get a say. 

end of story. there's no big discussion to be had. sexuality has nothing to do with how well you do your job. the only problem arises when OTHER people go out of their way to make it a problem.

get over it, people are gay. people have been gay since the dawn of time. people will continue to be gay, wanna know why? because they're born that way.

seriously, join the 21st century already, we're moving on, so come along or get out the way. no one is stopping for you. 




 i know what you're asking, but i would be remiss if i didnt first start out by saying that we always recommend going thru a therapist/endo/GP first. that's because there is no such thing as a "standard dose" when it comes to HRT. everyone's body reacts differently, so it's always advisable to have a medical professional oversee your hormone therapy, especially since it's relatively easy to get to an informed consent clinic.

that being said, a great many people here, for one reason or another, do NOT have access to hrt with a prescription, and so choose to self-med. there are no judgments from any of us. 




 please be civil, i know it's a touchy subject for some of us. 




 have to preface this with the usual "I AM NOT A DOCTOR"

First off, your body is adjusting to running off new hormones, it's going to feel uncomfortable for a bit. and because everyone's body is different, we all adjust to it differently.

So here's what my endo told me about the first few doses, that your body will see the influx of estrogen as a sign that the testicles are failing, and it will signal your gonads to kick into overdrive, i.e. to produce MORE testosterone. after a few more shots, your body will interpret that as the new normal, and send a signal to shut down the production of T.

some people also go on an emotional rollercoaster, i had one time where i had to pull over to the side of the road and bawl my eyes out, for no reason.

and as for looks? yeah, that inbetweeny stage is a royal bitch, i aint gonna lie. but you HAVE to ride it out, trust me on this one. it gets WAY better on the other side.

tl;dr: it's normal, it will pass, hold on, it'll get better 




 yes, but does it bacon at midnight? 




 no, equality is never a problem. bigotry is. once you stop operating from a position that heterosexuality is the only option, the better off we will all be. 

there have been no issues with gay people serving in the US army regarding their sexuality. 

i'll go one step further, there are no issues with gay people in general, regarding their sexuality. 

the only problems arise when other people go out of their way to be bigots and make other people's sexuality their problem.

who people sleep with behind closed doors is none of your business. 

thank you for your time.

 meanwhile gay men and women serve openly with no issues in other countries' armed forces. i think it's safe to join the 21st century with the rest of the civilized world 




 i'm leaving their comment up because you have an excellent reply, even tho their account was a throwaway. it's not the first time it was brought up, and it wont be the last, so the more often we reply to it, the more little bits and pieces of a rational repudiation of that position gets added to the narrative. 














 *sigh* i see we've still got a long way to go before singapore gets gay rights. 



















 and if you want to ask the community itself, come hop on /r/genderqueer. you'll see gender expressions that run the gamut.

it boils down to a very simple premise, find out where on the spectrum you feel most comfortable. simple in theory, complex to achieve. you just have to keep trying to see what works for you. 




 live and let live, the less hung up people are over gender expression, the better of we'll all be. 









 please be civil
