 brb, brushing my teeth 




 Personally, I dislike cowls and two tone paint and chrome wheels, but it's a 66 and isn't the worst thing I see.

We all have our different tastes and in the end, we all like cars, so.
As long as you enjoy it and like it, thats all that matters. 




 Damn, we just went through Cali too. Went to CC and the saleen show. 




 Your friend is me. lol 




 Arizona? Are you part of DSAZ? 




 no gtx 980, 0/10

but seriously, nice. :) 




 Always get breakfast because they have to make it right then and it's always hot. The other stuff can sit in a heated tray for 30-45 minutes depending on what it is, you never want 40 minute old popcorn chicken. It's just hard and blah. 




 Yeah, we just put on tight gloves so they don't fall off. It's close! 




 Yeah we should have blue band aids, since that's what I was thought, but I don't get them, I just wear the ones we've got and put a glove on. Better then nothing. 




 We're not that awesome with our bandaids, we just get any bandaid that will stand out, so sometimes we have hello kitty, other times we have super heros.

I go for the kitty though. 




 I work at Sonic and we're not allowed to use those bandaids since they blend in. That's fucking gross though, and the lady who refunded you should be fired. Shit wouldn't last where I am. 




 Don't play online then. Or play a closed game. Easy. 




 Miles are high, but it looks good. Headlights are iffy, looks like he home did it.
Definitely drive it yourself and have someone you trust inspect it.

I got my '95 v6 for 1.7k, Sure its a POS but its my POS. 




 I watched a video with a lot of those in there, and what's sad is the video with the yellow car, they passed in really early in the video and about 10 minutes later after shooting up multiple car, they chase it and it's just full of college age kids. Super sad. 




 Damn man, that's rough. I hope you're doing/feeling better. One day, you'll get her again.

I hope this get fixed, is this happening to anyone else?? 




 Heer_, everytime you post, I feel like I have to just say that you own the car I dream of.

This is seriously the highest thing on my list of wants, fuck it, NEEDS.

TR 10th, so sexy.. 




 I got one year to get a Termi. Alright. Let's do this. 




 So there's hope?! Edit:I meant to reply, not add a new thread.. 




 That's a sick idea! 




 I envy you. 




 Pls OP. 




 ouch! 




 Saw one at PAVS last night! Really cool! 




 :) 




 I'd go with the Mach 1 set up, but thats me. 




 Every year this happens. When will people learn.. 




 I was a minor and my parents paid, from what I know, it was kinda expensive, even ambulance rides.. 




 I went to a place, food was decent, had groups, had gym time, meds, a room with a roommate.
I never went to groups the 2nd and 3rd time. I just slept, ate, went to gym, and socialized while they played movies.

They're not bad. 




 can I have an invite? test_subject7776 :) thanks 




 Still wouldn't watch again. 




 Personally no, but I see a Mach 1 with an eaton on it all the time at PAVS. 




 If they call it Terminator, I'm done. 




 bruh..
:( That hurts. 




 'cause turbo 









 Correct. 




 So it was a real Shelby GT? 




 Live in Arizona, never heard of it. 




 Best I could find was yellow on black.. http://www.cafepress.com/mf/87038842/ford-mustang-silhouettehistory_tshirt?productId=1275511089

or go for red on white.. http://www.cafepress.com/mf/87038840/ford-mustang-silhouettehistory_tshirt?productId=1252026288 




 I know that the black stripe widening to the hood scoop is the [Mach look](https://www.google.com/search?q=mach+1+lookespv=2source=lnmstbm=ischsa=Xei=tw29U7mKMtaeyASpwIDICQved=0CAYQ_AUoAQbiw=1920bih=1019), but that's it. 




 WOOO! AZ reppin'!
We're not so boring! 




 Quick question, how do I know the appearance difference between the v6 and the 4 banger? 




 He does what he wants, cause he can. 




 god... no.. 




 True, True... 




 Nothing like a Subaru.... 




 Favorite body style. 




 Yeah! 




 No problem man! 




 He had a neon mustang logo on a stand that sits in his car. Hard to see the stand, but it's there! 









 My god, I want it... 




 Wheres your front end pony? 




 You alive buddy? I hope so, you still have so much time left.
