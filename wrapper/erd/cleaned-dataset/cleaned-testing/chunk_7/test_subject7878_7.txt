 Interesting points of view.  Interesting in deed. 




 I remember reading Arya's story in the books and thinking, "What the hell is going on with her story?!" 




 Bran mentioned the story in the show.

 It's an American-style "biscuit" made by folding the dough over onto itself over and over instead of punching out the dough with a cutter.  The result is an American-style biscuit with the layers of a croissant.

 God, I loved my Alphie! 



















 Two hours, California.  Be ready just in case!  Can't hurt to stock up on water--oh, wait... 




 I remember when Wal-Mart had Sam's Choice machines with 25 drinks.  Damn, I miss those days. 









 Did he say he had kids in the trunk of his truck?  Did he mean the bed of trunk... that had a trunk cover on it...?

WTF?!

Also, having kids in the car doesn't mean you get to drive on the wrong side of the road.  Drunk-ass hick.

 Two great actors; two great characters! 




 The video thumbnail looks like I'm being robbed by Tom Green.  WTF? 




 I can't believe I spent the time to do that.

SPOILER:  It makes a ball-sack, and part of a penis. 




 Hard to tell... if only there was a banana for scale. 




 iOS only... poo... 




 Guess what--people with kids or cats don't care, and never will care. 




 I hate that one can't edit the title/original post of threads. 




 Yep, I love not having to dirty a measuring cup now. 




 Misleading title... they are oil-painting-rendered, not actual oil-paintings. 




 Yep.  Been like this for a while now.  It was a genius move. 




 Because like every single thing Apple makes: they want you to buy a new one. 




 No, I'm not... ***interested***. 




 YAY!  ...so... what do I win? 




 A tent...? 




 I normally use asterisks, but Reddit doesn't like them. 




 They REALLY don't care about closed sets at ALL for this movie, do they? 




 Dunno why, but I was expecting the Queen of England for some odd reason. 




 Welcome to the club, nerrrrrd. 




 I've seen this video, and it **still** amazes me that this many people will just pee on the side of a building in the middle of town.  Go inside and pee, ya lazy bastard. 




 Boy, his back is going to hate him in a few years. 




 Television and the internet raised most of the millennials. 




 Holy shit! 




 Yeah, because we all know that an 89-year-old man with health issues doesn't just die on his own while in hospice care....  ***#eyeroll*** 




 ...yep... you are correct... 




 Huh--I always thought it was CGI as well. 




 I have no problem with that game.

Since I don't know your username, give me a challenge sometime.  My username is: **stephen.nesbit** 




 You have inoperable cancer. 




 I was thinking the same thing. This brought back dial-up AOL days. Hahaha! 




 That's a way of looking at it, but he says DWW's name, and uses pronouns like "you".  I'd say he's talking directly.

 Wind In His Hair: "Dances with Wolves! I am Wind In His Hair. Do ***you*** see that I am ***your*** friend? Can ***you*** see that ***you*** will always be my friend?"

He also ends with a question... Although it could be read as rhetorical.  




 At the end of the movie, Wind In His Hair is yelling to Dances With Wolves about how they are friends, and always will be.  Dances With Wolves never replies or even acknowledges his friend's words.  This always bothers me.  Why?  Was it a Lakota thing? 









 If my wife did this to me, I think it'd freak me out.  




 Boobs. 




 Girl graduates high school.

Girl majors in feminism.

Girl miraculously finds a job she loves. 




 The fact that she's lazy as hell, forcing me to clean up 90% of our family's mess.

I don't ignore it really, but I never say anything. 




 I like to use the fruit/vine method.

The fruit (electronic device) has to be back on the vine (charger) before bedtime, or it's taken away the next day or two. The charger is in a very public part of the house (in our case, the living room). 




 The songs he has are very... convincing. It's bizarre.  




 There's only the problem of a 3 and 4 year old who DON'T have the ability to take care of themselves.

But thanks for judging. 




 She'd be going to Broadmoor. I went to Istrouma Middle and Scotlandville High (for a couple years). I survived. 




 Last time I checked, one couldn't text, watch videos, play games, or do social media on a sheet of paper.  




 What WE determine what Earthly days are, not a "day" to God. Genesis is very metaphorical when it relates to time. 




 [Way to go ILM!](http://media0.giphy.com/media/11uArCoB4fkRcQ/giphy.gif) 




 Wow... bet that tasted nasty. 









 Yeah--that's a good idea.  Thanks! 









 Agreed.  I've been working part- or full-time since I was 15yo.  I had to so I could pay for my phone and car insurance.  Then it moved to helping pay for rent/bills when my parents divorced, and my mom didn't have a GREAT job.  I had to grow up quickly. 




 We tell her all the time to ask us if she needs help. 




 Which wasn't a problem when homework was done with books/paper.

Now it's on a laptop that we have no way of keeping an eye on unless we're literally sitting over her shoulder. 




 Wow... wish I didn't know that now... 




 It is a very nice school; worth the $8k+ if results are made.  We've had meetings with the teachers; she's met with the guidance counselor.  Her grades started declining around 6th grade, and have gotten progressively worse each year.

She says she realizes this.

While I was working late last night, my wife sat down and talked to her about everything for about 1 hours.  My wife said our daughter DOES care, but just doesn't let us know for some odd reason. 




 PM sent. 




 The original owner Kyoo sold it to one of the Admins: DarthBrendo. 




 One would think. 




 This is a forum that's been around since 1999.  Back then, it was known as Jedi.net.  I've been around since 2000.  We've tried to pick the site back up now that the new movies/shows/etc. are back out.  We could use some fresh blood.

There's discussion on multiple topics, role-playing, fanfic, fanart, etc.  Come on over, and let's chat about Star Wars.

My username there is: [Stephen](http://i.imgur.com/gj4Vw7K.jpg).  Come join me! 









 A baby doll. 




 Haha, I've done the "job is school" bit.  Didn't think about the rest. 




 How would you have afforded $8.5k ?! 




 We've been dating/married since the step-daughter was 10-months-old.  I've helped raise her.

Nothing major has happened lately. 




 I cannot STAND the laptop. 




 She was allowed to keep our church's children's choir as it was her last year to be able to be in it, and she's been in it since 3rd grade.

Really, by activities, it was really just the book club and sporting events. 




 It's frustration.  This is year #4 with the same problems getting worse and worse... no matter what we do.

 









 We shouldn't have to go through this much crap.  Y'know?!

Get your work done, THEN fart around!

If they spent as much effort doing homework as they do trying to get around firewalls, blocks, etc., they'd be done in 30-60 mins tops. 




 She's my step-daughter, and her daughter, so my opinion doesn't factor as much.

When it comes to our other two kids, I'd put my foot down (assuming they are selfish and lazy like their sister). 




 The private school academics ARE better than the public school... if one does the work.

If one doesn't, there's no point. 




 She keeps finding new apps to chat with as I delete and block others. 




 That's how I think as well... my wife believes otherwise. 




 I tried some of those, her school IT said I had to take them off because it was affecting her work while on the school's server/firewall.

They also use YouTube and whatnot for school. 




  Has she always been a lazy kid - who doesn't see any reason to put in more than minimal effort?

Yes.

 Are you (as parents) or her siblings high acheivers? Is there pressure to be an achiever? is she rebelling against pressure or expectations that either she doesn't want or feels she can't meet?

We just expect her to do her work, and show actual effort in her studies.  That is lacking.

 Have you had her tested for a learning disability? Do you see times when she is absolutely able to do well if she applies herself?

She was tested for ADD/ADHD, and the test shown borderline minimal results.  Those times are few and far between.

 Is her personality counter to school culture - is she a free spirited, creative kid who doesn't like too much structure or being put in a box? Is she more hands on ?

She is very hands-on.

 What are her talents, hobbies, interests? When do you see her really engage in something? What does she enjoy? Where does she put effort?

She doesn't really have any REAL hobbies that she gets truly engaged into... unless texting/video-chatting on her friggin' phone is considered a hobby.

 Does she see any connection between school and her life? Any ideas what she wants to do after high school? Any older kids who she knows that have gone on to college?

She says she does. Says she wants to go to college. Apparently is now interested in photography (since she shows no signs of taking photos).  She has an older cousin attending LSU right now.

 Is she engaged at school outside of academics? Strong circle of friends? gets along with teachers? Involved in clubs, sports, teams or other school related extracurriculars?

She has had her extracurricular activities taken away as punishment for grades.  She has only one REAL friend...

 How is she mood wise? Lots of teen angst? Any signs of depression? Does she want to e Goth or emo or non mainstream in her self-expression?

Aside from treating me like a stereotypical step-daughter treats her step-father; no. 




 Her cell phone is on our company's plan, paid for by us.

Clothes are paid for by us.

Entertainment (which doesn't happen very often) is sometimes her and sometimes us. 




 The teachers were willing to help a lot in her 6th-8th grade levels.  Now, everything is on her school-provided distraction (i.e., required laptop).  While she's "doing her homework" (i.e., watching YouTube, chatting with friends, etc.), we assume she's doing her homework.

Her teachers view the students as being to be responsible by this age (which they should), and will sort of help with large assignments if asked, but not day-to-day homework. 




 Gold?  Who do you think I am?  Letterman? 









 That's not what I meant exactly.  She can be lazy and lie about doing homework and whatnot for free at a public school instead of paying $800+ a month for the same end-effect. 




 Scenario: 15yo daughter just completed her freshman year at a private, Catholic school costing $8k a year.  Showed little to no initiative in schoolwork, constantly got zeroes on homework, poor grades on tests, let to failing one class and barely getting C's and D's in others.

Tuition is going up to $8.5k next year, and I argue for taking her out of the school since it's practically a waste of money. 

My wife argues to keep her in because it's a better education than the public schools in East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) Parish.

I counter-argue that it's not a better education if she's not getting anything from it anyway because she simply doesn't care, and constantly complains about how hard it is.

*Edit: Thanks for all the comments.  This is an issue we've been struggling with for a few years.  Any time we try to determine why, all we get is either, "I don't know," or, "It's just how I am."*

1. /u/SteveHarveysSuit -- I'm not sure we know exactly what she'd want.  She's all about social, so I'd be willing to bet she'd pick staying just to not have to make friends all over again.

2.  /u/NovelTeach and /u/dmf95742 -- She makes no money to pay for anything.  That would require a job.  We tried the F = -$10; D = -$5; C = $0; B = +$5; and A = +$10 for report cards, but when the negatives outweigh the positives, it became pointless.

3. /u/flakemasterflake -- She doesn't seem to care about peer pressure... at least academically. 




 It sounds like you rushed into RCIA before you were ready. I was raised Assemblies of God.  I attended Catholic mass for two years before going through RCIA.  

I spoke to many Catholics about many things. You need to find a few solid Catholics, and just talk with them a while.  We all go through it.

I too struggled with masturbation. Not so much a problem now that I'm married. Hehe.  That one is tough.  I'd suggest /r/NoFap for support on that one.

Talk to priest or deacon you trust. Get counseling sessions set up.  I'm sure they'd work with you.

Side-Note: I believe that homosexuality itself is not a sin. Acting on the sexual urges, and therefore committing fornication/adultery, is the sin. 




 Purely coincidental, I think. 




 Fourty-two. 




 Holy crap--I can't believe that works!  HAHAHAHA! 




 Hahaha!  This happened to me with our first-born.  So nasty! 




 Sounds like Obama...

"Didn't get the vote I want; I'll just executive order it through anyway.  Screw y'all!" 




 What the hell is this?  This is a martial art?  Walking in a circle while touching and holding hands? 









 That's a nice... ***stalagshite***. 









 WTF did I just watch...?

"The nipples, the nipples, the nipples... hee-hee!"

Les Franais sont bizarres. 




 Oh, my God--my mom had this too!

I spent 45 minutes uninstalling a crap-ton of these damn things.  "I never installed any of those.  I think my laptop is hacked."

I kept thinking, "Why would anyone hack a 58yo woman's damn laptop?  Seriously?  You just blindly install any 2nd/3rd-tier programs on the ones you install, and end up with toolbars and malware galore!"

 Helium makes me chuckle... HeHeHeHe... 




 Yep, there are a LOT of lazy people in this state. Annoys the crap out of me. I work hard to support my family; to send my kids to decent schools; to live in a safe neighborhood. I hate having to help support all the free-loaders that are only alive to collect a damn check every month simply because they CAN. 




 What?!

No Superguy, Spider-Guy, Ellsa/Annah, or Poweful Rangers? 




 Just Google [drum cadences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2tZLf_jbKo). 




 Yep.

This [wikia page](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Differences_between_books_and_TV_series_-_Season_5) does a great job listing the differences between the books and series; even dividing it by series episode. 




 Double Chocolate Chip is my favorite ... unless the gingerbread is the flavor of the month. 




 Only wanting to tax the rich while not taxing the poor is hypocritical in a society truly based on equality. 




 This sounds like me and my wife.  We're doing MyFitnessPal and FitBit combos.  Dieting is hard.  We caved today, and got bundlets from Nothing Bundt Cake.  *#drool* 




 Flat tax on purchased goods ***only***.

Someone making $30k a year might spend $200-$300 month on food.  9% tax on that is only $27.  They might buy a $5k used car.  9% tax on that is $450.

Someone making $100k a year might spend $1200 a month on food.  9% tax on that is $108.  They might buy an $85k new car.  9% tax on that is $7,650!

tl;dr :: Rich people buy more (and more expensive) things than poor people.  It's fair.

________________
I find it funny how progressives always talk about equality across the board... until it comes to rich people and their money... hehehe... 




 I don't know why.  You can see the cock-blocker protecting him from the cock. 




 What a massively useless buildup.  LOL!  I love it! 




 Excluding Tom Benson, it's not like Louisiana has a ton of rich people to tax.

I find it funny how everyone's first reaction is to only tax rich people.

My suggestion: flat tax on purchased goods only. 




 I'm a B.R. resident, but I can vouch for the shitty N.O. roads.  I hate driving down there where the sewer manholes are 2" above the road.  Ugh!
