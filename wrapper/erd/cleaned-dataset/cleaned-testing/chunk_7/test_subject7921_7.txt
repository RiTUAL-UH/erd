 History says this poster is a male.
 




 Let's see some red marks on one of those cheeks.
 




 Lovely, really like the outfit.  Now just needs spanked for being so naughty.
 




 Awesome as always.  




 Depends how long she was a friend, or if you liked her as a friend before things went downhill.

Not to say she was right, but depressed people can emotionally manipulate even if they aren't intending it.  I know I used to focus on one person or two and think they were the solution to my sadness, if only they would.........insert whatever

Im the same with conversations, even with my depression improved some...  And honestly people get kind of scared to say anything to you that might be offensive, so they don't want to talk to you fearing you'll go out and off yourself or spiral.


It's not your fault, but being a person who tends to get depressed myself.  I don't think I could take too much of another depressed person with the circular logic stuff....I do it myself ALLLLLLLLLLLL the time and it annoys me.  So I can only imagine what other people think when I try to explain it and why Im stuck.

And I've had people who I thought were avoiding me......or had cut me out.  Decide if they are worth the effort, if not, then count them as an acquaintance instead of a friend.  Be nice, but don't invest in them until they invest in you again.  That means inviting them to things, trying to make plans with them, etc.  You can contact her and tell her you've worked on it and are sorry for what you said, but let her make the first move in meeting or talking since she withdrew.

I figure that's mature enough...I struggle with letting go and blaming myself for issues.  So just realize shit happens and might happen again.  And realize that me saying that doesn't make it easy to deal with as easy as it is to say.
 




 Sparklers, individual wrapped cheese, some kind of child's toy which will depend on where you are probably.

And if you use those things already, I'd like to hear the story. 




 When I graduated, they had a review of their program.  I spoke with the Dean if I remember correctly.  He changed my review while we were sitting there to increase the score after speaking with me and determining he thought the score should be higher.

Same school that I reported a group of people cheating during a test and nothing happened (they were foreign grad students), but they were bringing the hammer down on the local under-grad students for getting help on projects.

I dont even think they realize how worthless that makes their school when those stories start getting out.
 




 Well whatever it ends up being, the supergirl one is probably my favorite.  Thanks for posting! 




 Went through some of your photos.  Maybe it's just me, but I think all of your blonde hair cosplay ones look "right" on you versus any other hair color.  I dont know if it's the color or the wig/whatever...or your coloring.  The exception being one where you had black hair and face paint, that one looked fine.  So Im inclined to say coloring.  Can't put my finger on it though.
 




 You look to be at a healthy weight to me.  I am really not seeing the bloat/heaviness you mention.

And your previous post, that was quite an amazing change.  Yay for boobs.
 




 Some of the anti-depressants supposedly will increase the damage alchohol does to your liver...like so much so that they put a warning on the label about it.  Cymbalta is one.

Plus alcohol makes you depressed.  And yes I can understand the pressure to drink, but you also have to consider that if drinking is the only thing that makes you worthwhile to them then there's an underlying issue there.
 




 At this point in time, with how much they check to see that you've registered despite the chance of a draft being called being slim.  They might as well make it universal or do away with it, because it's just a cost and a burden.  Not to mention you're not eligible for employment and other things as a man if you're not signed up.....which I think is fucked.

Think about all those forms where you have to check that you did register for the draft and if you havent you can do it by........

If it's not being used but to also register you for voting (and jury duty selection to boot), then I don't see the point of just doing away with it or making everyone do it (along with registering to vote and jury duty selection chance).

 




 Really like this picture. 




 F4M = female looking for male, post indicates it should be M4F or M4M.
 




 *jaw drop* 




 I've had it for years IMO.  But it just got progressively worse until it was literally crippling.  

I believe have some sort of major physical trauma would be easier to deal with than depression.  Because people can understand physical. Mental, people think you're just weak or should snap out of it.....or "don't be like that".  And some of the people saying that shit to you are depressed themselves, but not bad enough quite yet.
 




 Thanks for posting, you seem like a very happy person and I have enjoyed seeing your smile.  Hate to see you go. 




 Thanks for posting,  




 Yes, nice display there.  And saw your collar/leash post in your history.  Rawr. 




 If only cloning existed....
 




 I would suggest going with no intention of bidding on anything just to see the people and how it's done.

A lot of these places will waste your time by cherry picking out the stuff they want and selling the junk or having "plants" in the crowd to drive up the price some.  

When they cherry pick, they take out the items they know are worth more to certain crowds and then sell them through their auction company at another venue.    Locks will be removed, things will obviously have been disturbed with a lack of dust and what not before you ever see what's in there.

Haven't found one around here where what is happening seems like an honest auction.  

It'll catch up to them eventually when their storage places get tired of hiring them for low turnouts.
 




 Yeah, Im attempting to work on stuff some, but......shit just keeps on rolling in.  Pretty words and hopeful attitudes don't fix some things.
 




 Sounds easy.  But it's not really something Im comfortable even attempting anymore TBH.  Might be the way the game is designed, but holy shit does all that false bravado and pretending and trying to carry conversations just get tiring.  Being the "I don't have anything better to do right now than talk to this person" guy.  Or the teehee, I need help with this and you're super interesting until I get what I need from you gambit some women play.

I personally don't see how some guys don't become bitter.  I don't rage-aholic asshole guy because of it like I see a lot of posts on reddit with the name-calling and shaming, but I can kind of understand the mentality behind it.  Since I'm way less tolerant of bullshit than I used to be, and it's definitely had a negative impact on my general outlook on life and the future.

And very few people want to be around a depressed/whatever person, so it only compounds IMO.  Shrug.  Guess I should just go ahead and say it.  After awhile suicide starts to seem like a pretty valid solution to the eternally-looking single life if you never get anywhere.
