 I've got to agree with you.  The dude who got shot was aggressively pushing the door open against the officer.  His behavior looks pretty clearly threatening to me. 




  That's up to the grand jury and eventually regular jury that will presumably hear this case.

He said without a trace of irony.
 














 But he still keeps that 2% carry, amirite?   














   And the need for CEOs that can make good decisions is very fucking high while the supply of good CEOs that can make good decisions is very very low. It's always simple supply and demand.

[High paid CEOs perform poorly](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/319221-report-high-paid-ceos-performing-poorly ).  Just like this guy did.

A better explanation for these exorbitant pay rates is that [the incentives are misaligned](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/great-men-great-pay-why-ceo-compensation-is-sky-high/2014/06/12/6e49d796-d227-11e3-9e25-188ebe1fa93b_story.html ).  Specifically, the people who set the pay of CEOs are themselves CEOs, very often people who sit on each others' boards.  Even in the case where the mutual benefit isn't this direct, CEOs have a strong incentive to set high pay rates to drive up the market for CEO pay.  There's are strong incentives for back scratching. 




 Drive down the central valley and you'll see two kinds of signs: for Republican candidates and complaints that the government is not doing enough about the drought.  The irony. 




 Oblivion was a really solid scifi film, IMO - great script, great acting, and concept - but why didn't it succeed?  I'd put it in a category I'd call 'concept scifi'. Cypher,  Existenz, and Enders Game are good examples I'd put in this category.  Less successful examples (IMO) are Dark City  and Primer.  All of these films (the great and the not so great) have plots which  on a reveal which comes toward the end.  They're reminiscent of  Twilight Zone or Outer Limits or some classic Star Trek episodes.  The viewer is suspended in a state of confusion about what is happening until the conclusion, which if it's done right, can be mind-bending.

One might think a film like Edge of Tomorrow would qualify, but there's not actually a sudden reveal --- the "trick" of the world the protagonist inhabits is obvious from the earliest scenes, and his progress to understanding the solution is a gradual process that involves a clear goal.  The concept-scifi films I mention lead you along a path and suddenly change the terms with the reveal.  I have no idea why EoT didn't do much much better than it did --- it should have, IMO.  Maybe it didn't have enough emotional touch points, which the public seems to crave.  Chalk that up as another reason we can't have nice things.

I suspect that concept scifi has an even worse problem, however --- the world it presents is a false one, and it holds the viewer in that falsehood for a large part of the duration of the film.  The result is a kind of alienation of the viewer from the world thats presented.  The film maker is basically on the hook for presenting an uncomfortable world in which something is "off".  I suspect that for a lot of viewers instead of that being intriguing, they experience dissatisfaction, an unease which isn't resolved by the puzzle pieces coming together at the end of the film.

It's a shame.  I love these kinds of films, and wish there were more of them.



 in that it had an austere, alienated quality to it.  I loved it, and wish there would be more like this.  Honestly, I can't for the life of me figure out why EoT didn't do better.  But there it is.   









 Bernie is terrific on the issues, serious, no bullshit, and could show that uncomplicated left wing politics is the key to winning back the white working class.  Bernie would have to defend socialism, of course, but I think he'd do it expertly, and wingnut heads would explode when they found people (a) didn't care about the label and (b) agreed with his policy positions.  That would go a long way to puncturing the red-baiting right wing bullshit we've had to listen to these past 40 years. 




 Reagan fooled gullible Americans into cheering for trickle down economics. Truly and honestly, I don't see anything to praise about that.  Con men, after all, are charismatic.  We don't need a con man of the left.  We need someone who speaks truth and fights for what counts.  The right has never given us a leader like that.  They had to invent a fiction around Reagan.  Let's not play into their rhetoric by offering that criminal actor our praise. 














 I hear what you're saying, but for me it was obvious what Reagan was from day one.  And honestly, he was *hated* as evidenced by his terrible approval ratings.  After his death, the Republican propaganda machine kicked in to rehabilitate his reputation.  Let's not play into that fabricated meme.  Reagan was a lying and hated ideologue of the right who brought us the war on drugs, trickle down economics and had the most scandals of any President, with more officials in his government indicted or convicted than anyone else.  That's the only story that needs to play regarding him. 




 Let's put it this way: We need an FDR.

Fuck Reagan and the poisonous horde that worships him.

 [Optimal Tip-to-Tip Efficiency](http://www.scribd.com/doc/228831637/Optimal-Tip-to-Tip-Efficiency )

A probabilistic model is introduced for the problem of stimulating a large male audience.  Double jerking is considered, in which two shafts may be stimulated with a single hand. Both tip-to-tip and shaft-to-shaft configurations of audience members are analyzed. We demonstrate that pre-sorting members of the audience according to both shaft girth and leg length allows for more efficient stimulation. Simulations establish steady rates of stimulation even as the variance of certain parameters is allowed to grow, whereas naive unsorted schemes have increasingly flaccid performance. 




 Definitely a click-baity title, but there's substance towards the end:

 [Bitcoin miners] are stuck... in a catch-22: they can't afford to keep mining, but they can't afford to stop mining, either. (This, coincidentally, is the same dilemma that oil drillers who borrowed a lot during the boom face now during the bust). This has already forced one big mining group into default. And it's forced the rest to sell the only assets they haveBitcoinsto pay back their dollar debts. That, of course, only pushes the price of Bitcoin down even further, which makes even more miners sell their Bitcoins to pay back they owe as mining becomes more unprofitable. And so on, and so on.

 Bitcoin, in other words, is suffering a deleveraging shock like the one that hit our economy in 2008, but without a Federal Reserve to cushion the blow. That means this doom loop of debt and Bitcoin deflation could take prices down a lot further still. The only solace is that, in the long run, the system should self-correct, as miners drop out and mining gets easier.

 I'm becoming convinced she's not running.  It's too bad. 




 Also watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f519_LGjhCA 




 I thought we "need to look forward, not back", or does that only apply to war criminals? 




 It was a huge disappointment to see both of them take the position that they did.   




 Look at their histories.

Obama had literally no track record *at all* of fighting for progressive policy.  At Harvard Law, he was known for intermediating between two sides.  At Kerry's nominating convention he gave a famous speech "One America, not two Americas", which advocated centrism and bipartisanship.  During the primaries he praised Reagan, supported  immunity of the telecom companies which participated in domestic spying programs, supported conserva-Dem Joe Lieberman over the excellent progressive Joe Lamont.    Obama even said that supporters were misconstruing him as a progressive.  He made a point of saying that "there are extremes on both sides" that are not helpful.   The man made it as clear as day that he was a centrist.  Voters were not paying attention.  

Warren has had a *long* track record of fighting for the middle class.  She first came to public notice when, as a professor at Harvard, she gave a talk called ["The Coming Collapse of the Middle Class"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akVL7QY0S8A ).   It's worth watch in full.  Since then, Warren identified a part of the problem as the lack of accountability of the big banks, which allowed them to privatize their gambling risks and socialize their losses.  She pushed for a new Federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which makes regulations preventing financial institutions from cheating consumers.  Republicans prevented her from becoming head of the agency, but she won that major victory.  That agency is estimated to have saved consumers some billions of dollars in excessive charges (too lazy to provide a link, but easily googleable).  She has been extremely sharp-tongued in calling out Republicans.  She has not said "both sides are the problem".  She has even called out Obama and his centrist nominees, recently scuttling Wall Street stooge Antonio Weiss.  She's fought for cheaper loans for students ("If banks get .75%, why can't students get that too?").  Just do a bit of research on her.    The woman is a progressive firebrand that Obama never was and never said he was. 



















 So many fucking racists on Reddit now.  It makes me want to leave.  Fuck these mainstream Americans or whatever the fuck they are. 




 Jesus, that isn't obvious?  Now we know for near certain that he's a criminal sociopath, and most likely walked from a murder conviction because the victim was black. 




 Big f'ing difference.  Warren has a track record of actually fighting for economic populist issues.  Obama has a track record of triangulation and bipartisanship.  From his very earliest days he praised Reagan, talked about "One America, not two" bullshit, supported Joe Lieberman over progressive Ned Lamont, supported immunity of telecoms from prosecution, etc.  Obama made it clear pretty early that he saw it as his role to bring left and right together, not fight for progressive goals. 




  edit: I guess people do, it is dumb though

Why?  It's a pretty standard political phrase for identifying a faction in a political party by their ostensible leader.  

E.g., "The Ted Cruz wing of the Republican party". http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2014/12/30/washpost-conservatives-slam-ted-cruz-wing-gop-too-much-clarity

And it's pretty much undisputed that Warren is seen as the leader of the progressives.

 Domestic spying, shielding financial and war criminals from prosecution, and getting Democratic partisans to defend these ideas will be his legacy.  Not race. 




 He bailed out the banks against the wishes of his base.

He pushed the Bush/Cheney policy on detention, drones, and illegal wiretapping.  I could go on. 
























 Obviously, it won't in the short run.  But nobody is going to vote for weak-sauce Democrats who are wanna-be conservatives.  The South used to be a place of populist workers movements, and they voted for FDR.  There is no party that speaks to them now because of DLC third-way Democrats like Clinton and Obama.  Wingnuts tell them that they are disenfranchised because of social programs.  Until we have Democrats who tell the other side of the story, we'll never make big wins. 









 **Submission Statement**

A more nuanced look at the issues, delving into the backgrounds of the attackers, the role of the Iraq war (the attackers were radicalized by it, but Charlie Hebdo argued against it), and the hypocrisy of double standards:

  Under French law, the magazine could run cartoons mocking Islam, but it could not run cartoons mocking the Holocaust. In fact, in 2009, Charlie Hebdo fired Maurice Sinet (known as Sin), one of its most famous cartoonists, because of a column in which he suggested that Nicolas Sarkozys son would go a long way in life after marrying a Jewish heiress. But murdering cartoonists will not put a stop to double standards. 

 




   I don't think anyone should be surprised that when it comes to opinions on the middle east, Al Jazeera is not your best source.

Evidence? 




 How does this article show that Al Jazeera is biased? 




 Oh great, the main right wing organ in the most far right country on Earth slices and dices the text from the emails for maximum Hasbara, and it gets voted to the top in Reddit.

Please read the actual emails.

 Defending freedom of expression in the face of oppression is one thing; insisting on the right to be obnoxious and offensive just because you can is infantile, Khadr wrote. Baiting extremists isnt bravely defiant when your manner of doing so is more significant in offending millions of moderate people as well. And within a climate where violent response  however illegitimate  is a real risk, taking a goading stand on a principle virtually no one contests is worse than pointless: its pointlessly all about you.

 And I guess if you encourage people to go on insulting 1.5 billion people about their most sacred icons then you just want more killings because as I said in 1.5 billion **there will remain some fools who dont abide by the laws or know about free speech** [sic].

 What Charlie Hebdo did was not free speech it was an abuse of free speech in my opinion, go back to the cartoons and have a look at them! Salem later wrote. It snot [sic] about what the drawing said, it was about how they said it. **I condemn those heinous killings, but IM NOT CHARLIE.**

And lets remember that Al Jazeera has been repeatedly targeted by the US military and the Israeli IDF in attacks which killed their reporters.  Not a peep from the "free speech solidarity" crowd on that.  In fact, just this past year, the same French politicians organizing the Hebdo free speech rally suppressed a pro-Palestinian march during Israel's recent bombing of Gaza.

The hypocrisy is ripe.  Of course Al Jazeera journalists are going to be a bit peeved. 




 Well that certainly has a familiar ring to it. 









 That last link - holy shit.  I'd like to hear Sam Harris talk about why Islam is objectively "more evil" in that context. 




  Greenwald is rarely worth reading and this is not one of those rare occasions. 

YSK, leading off with an ad hominem attack against a journalist who broke the biggest story of the past year is not exactly a winning rhetorical strategy.

  To imply that publishing the cartoons means automatically embracing their content is nonsense. They are integral to the story, just like at the time of the Danish cartoon incident, as a reader I wanted to see the pictures to understand what angered people so much about them.

He said nothing of the kind.  He's talking about people who are advocating publishing the offensive cartoons *in solidarity*.  And, yes, that is a thing, in case you haven't noticed.

http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/07/media/charlie-hebdo-attack-journalists-solidarity/

https://www.change.org/p/editors-and-journalists-around-the-world-publish-charlie-hebdo-s-mohammed-cartoons-in-solidarity-with-the-victims-of-censorship-and-violence

 Greenwald is attacking a strawman here, sure a few people said we have to celebrate the cartoons,

Simply incorrect, CNN and many other outlets have noted (above).  

And even it were true, the people that Greenwald specifically mentions are not some fringe voices.  They are major figures of American political discourse.  By your standard we should mock anyone who responds to an idea presented in a NYTimes OpEd because it's "just a few voices".  

 How about not portraying one extreme as the public consensus and and entirely ignoring the rest of the spectrum?


I don't understand what you're getting at.  Could you clarify?

  Claiming you support freedom of expression and show solidarity and at the same time deciding not to publish the full story because it might offend part of your audience sounds empty at best. 

You've either completely missed Greenwald's point or are purposefully mischaracterizing what he said.  He's talking about people publishing the offensive work *in solidarity*. 

And his larger point is how utterly biased is this free speech solidarity.

Please let me know why there no outpouring of solidarity to republish Palestinian journalists when Israel killed 17 journalists just last year, an IDF officer even defending the attacks in the NYTimes saying:

 Such terrorists, who hold cameras and notebooks in their hands, are no different from their colleagues who fire rockets aimed at Israeli cities and cannot enjoy the rights and protection afforded to legitimate journalists.

Or when the US purposefully bombed Al Jazeera buildings, killing reporters.  Not a peep from the guardians of vaunted Western Values on that one.

 And let's not get into that marginalized minority bullshit,

See above.

  Implying this feeds into France's alleged foreign policy goals and attacking Harris - which is Greenwald's way of masturbating - who wrote an entire book against Christianity, didn't support the Iraq war

Sam Harris has stated that Islam is intrinsically worse than all other religions.  Ignoring history - two decades ago, ex-Hindu atheists committed the most terrorist attacks of anyone, and during the Islamic golden age, it was Islam that preserved the legacy of rational thought while western Europe was wallowing in its Inquisition.  Yeh, Sam Harris deserves zero respect at this point.

On the other point.  Try a bit of [research](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=+france+iraq).

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/france-iraq/

 




 Honestly, I think Sam Harris had it coming.  His argument is myopic and ahistoric in the extreme. Hitchens had a much better and more nuanced criticism of modern Islam and its problem with free speech, which I tend to agree with. 




 Huh?  Are you saying Greenwald is  advocating *banning* something?  That is completely backwards --- he's a passionate free speech advocate.  And I'm certainly not advocating that either.  The question was whether *ignoring* is the "adult" thing to do --- see the comment I'm responding to.   




 He does not use the word 'racist' or 'racism' a single time in that article. 









 Speaking as an atheist who tilts toward anti-theism, I'd say that there's more to the issue than that.  

It's worth reading Greenwald's commentary of the week's events  in full [here] (https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/01/09/solidarity-charlie-hebdo-cartoons/ ).

 This weeks defense of free speech rights was so spirited that it gave rise to a brand new principle: to defend free speech, one not only defends the right to disseminate the speech, but embraces the content of the speech itself. Numerous writers thus demanded: to show solidarity with the murdered cartoonists, one should not merely condemn the attacks and defend the right of the cartoonists to publish, but should publish and even celebrate those cartoons. The best response to Charlie Hebdo attack, announced Slates editor Jacob Weisberg, is to escalate blasphemous satire.

 Some of the cartoons published by Charlie Hebdo were not just offensive but bigoted, such as the one mocking the African sex slaves of Boko Haram as welfare queens. Others went far beyond maligning violence by extremists acting in the name of Islam, or even merely depicting Mohammed with degrading imagery, and instead contained a stream of mockery toward Muslims generally, who in France are not remotely powerful but are largely a marginalized and targeted immigrant population.

Is it right to simply ignore hate speech directed at marginalized minority populations?  I'm not so sure that just ignoring it is the adult thing to do. 

  it is simply not the case that Charlie Hebdo were equal opportunity offenders. Like Bill Maher, Sam Harris and other anti-Islam obsessives, mocking Judaism, Jews and/or Israel is something they will rarely (if ever) do. ... The vast bulk of their attacks are reserved for Islam and Muslims, not Judaism and Jews. Parody, free speech and secular atheism are the pretexts; anti-Muslim messaging is the primary goal and the outcome. And this messaging  this special affection for offensive anti-Islam speech  just so happens to coincide with, to feed, the militaristic foreign policy agenda of their governments and culture.

 









 Did you read the article or any of the actual statements made in the Al Jazeera emails?  

 And I guess if you encourage people to go on insulting 1.5 billion people about their most sacred icons then you just want more killings because as I said in 1.5 billion there will remain some fools who dont abide by the laws or know about free speech, he wrote.

 I condemn those heinous killing, but IM NOT CHARLIE, he wrote.

How is that a dissent based on irrational beliefs?

It's also worth noting that we've seen no such outpourings of support when Israel defended its killings of 17 Palestinian journalists this past year. An Op-Ed to the NYTimes from an IDF officer read:

 Such terrorists, who hold cameras and notebooks in their hands, are no different from their colleagues who fire rockets aimed at Israeli cities and cannot enjoy the rights and protection afforded to legitimate journalists.

Is this culture worthy of respect?  Or is the United States worthy of respect it deliberately targeted and killed Al Jazeera journalists?  Where was the outpouring of support for the vaunted Western values of free speech back then?

I think it's pretty reasonable for Al Jazeera journalists to be a bit disgusted by Western hypocrisy on this issue. 




 TIL Muslim is the new Communist. 




 That's up to Democrats. 




 I can't disagree with the spirit of this -- which is to say we need strong progressive leader*s* (not just one leader), but if you mean to defend Obama as "powerless", I have to disagree.  He has the power of appointment and serves as the de facto leader of the Democrats, and his choices have been abysmal.  


 




 The lesson of Obama was that we need leaders who have strong track records of fighting for progressive goals.  If the left in the US hasn't learn that lesson, they'll guarantee their irrelevancy ... and deserve it. 





























 Thanks, I'll check those out.  The book I had trouble with was actually Gravity's Rainbow, not CL49. 




 I apologize.  It's been many years -- I realize now that it was Gravity's Rainbow, not Crying of Lot 49.  It wasn't boredom so much as confusion.  I literally had trouble understanding what was going on or why I should pay attention to it.   I'd go through a few paragraphs and feel like "what did I just read"?  

 




 Thank you so much for that.  It's funny that this reminds me of how I describe Bergman's work to people who find it abstruse or pretentious.  In these situations the viewer/reader is trying too hard to read meaning into what is happening instead of experiencing the art on a moment-by-moment basis, similar to how we appreciate music.  

That is very helpful.  I'm going to try again.

Edit: Here's a link to some of my thoughts on Bergman from a long-ago reddit thread.
http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1fau0u/what_do_you_think_of_ingmar_bergman/ca8po7n

 [Vladimir Putin, Conservative Icon](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/ ) 




 So many unsupported assertions.  What is the point. 




 A classic political move - get someone who protects your flank and articulates your position to the other side. 




  That is an incredibly grim and depressing outlook... which is of course the right attitude when analyzing American politics.

On the other hand, she's incredibly smart, and probably quite well informed on the basic issues.  All of the top candidates prep for these debates, and she'll have the best advisors to bring her up to speed on details. It's also possible that she'll have an economic analysis of what's happening at the global level -- who wants what and why. 

In any case, I doubt this is going to be an issue in the primaries.  In the general election, she'll inoculate herself by choosing an appropriate running mate who fills out the resume.  E.g., Wesley Clark, or ... here's a crazy, not-so-crazy idea - Colin Powell.

And on the other other hand, this TNR piece argues that the fact that she's said so little is a strong indication that she's not running:
http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119965/elizabeth-warrens-foreign-policy-positions-are-mystery. 




 George W. Bush had foreign policy experience?  Or Obama?  Or Bill Clinton? 














 But, by using the present tense (even when prompted), she's explicitly leaving the door open.  I hope she runs.  

 




  We have all the transcripts, evidence, instructions, and testimony.

And they point to a pattern of a prosecutor who biased the proceedings in favor of the officer.  This prosecutor also made the *highly* unusual move of calling a press conference in which he essentially argued for the defense.  Numerous commentators have discussed the questionable behavior of the prosecutor in this case.  As Jeffery Toobin (who holds rather right wing views on civil liberties issues) noted, ["reserving this kind of special treatment for white police officers charged with killing black suspects cannot be an appropriate resolution."](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/use-grand-jury ).

 More importantly, this would give everyone else in any other grand jury freedom to voice whatever they want. Names, places, documents, etc. Who cares? Why are they being forced to secrecy in a grand jury when others aren't?

No - the unusual circumstances of this case, not least of which involve the strange behavior of the prosecutor suggest that the public interest is served in this case, and this exception is in fact provided for by  law.  This is made all the more urgent by the fact that [this prosecutor has a history of misleading grand juries](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marjorie-cohn/prosecutor-manipulates-grand-jury-to-shield-officer_b_6240578.html ).

 I googled your percentages and can't find support for them.

99.99% of the time, grand juries indict:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/24/the-single-chart-that-shows-that-grand-juries-indict-99-99-percent-of-the-time/

Police are indicted between 1% and 3% of the time, according to this Politifact estimate:

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/25/benjamin-crump/lawyer-ferguson-case-99-time-police-not-charged-de/

Actually, it's a known Wilson supporter who is suspected of lying, and McCulloch put her on the stand knowing she was likely lying:
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/16/new-information-reveals-witness-40-may-have-lied-during-her-gr/21117109/

  Its because no matter the circumstances, prosecutors will take a cop through the grand jury for every shooting.

I am not aware of that.  Do you have evidence of this?

 And since you lack a valid argument, you decided to just wave your waves and call the person that was politely discussing with you "anti-American".

1. As detailed above, I think my argument is quite valid.  

2. You weren't just "politely" discussing the issue, having accused the people on the other side of having a "bullshit political agenda".

3. I think you need to go back and re-read what I wrote.  I qualified my statement with an *if*.  You could easily answer "I do think this should be investigated, but lifting grand jury secrecy isn't the right way to do it". 




 The history is written.  It was a war crime.

 The great majority of Iraqis who died in the war were not innocents and were fighting on the wrong side.

LOL.  

And George Bush made a secret pact with Hitler and Aliens before he invaded.  No proof needed by these debate standards, amirite? 




 Are you sure it's not the prosecutor who has a bullshit political agenda?

I think we need some light on why grand jury cases decide to indict 99% of the time except when the defendant is a cop, in which case the percentage drops to 1.3%.  The other thing that changes is the way prosecutors present evidence.  

If you think it's bullshit that we shine some light on this process, you are fundamentally anti-America. 




 First, I see you didn't answer the question:  What did Iraqis do that justified a US invasion of their sovereign territory?

Second, that 100K+ body count refers to Iraqi *civilians*.
 




 Why are *schools* involved in the first place...  

(i.e., Virginia is breaking from common practice.) 




 Interesting, I did not know that.  Nonetheless, the politics are deeply conservative, whether it's Ds or Rs, wouldn't you agree? 




 Not quite.

[This](http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/most-underfunded-pension-plans-states ) Bloomberg dataset claims the worst funded states are:

1. Illinois (D)
2. Kentucky (R)
3. Connecticut (D)
4. Alaska (R)
5. Kansas (R)
6. New Hampshire (I)
7. Mississippi (R)
8. Louisiana (R)
9. Hawaii (D)
10. Massachusetts (D)

[New Hampshire is a swing state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_New_Hampshire ), so I labeled it (I).

That gives:
R: 5
D: 4
I: 1

So it's pretty much a toss up.  




  We send Americans over to risk their lives killing people who kill innocent people

I think you've got it backwards.   100,000 Iraqis did what to us? 



















 He didn't make it "open" - in fact, [one of the jurors is suing the prosecutor](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/grand-juror-sues-ferguson-prosecutor-over-darren-wilson-moratorium-20150105 ) to be allowed to reveal what actually did happen. 

 "Grand Juror Doe" is asking that they be allowed to speak about the grand jury case since McCulloch has presented a "not entirely accurate" portrait of the proceedings to the media, Mediate reports. 
 




  Nice argument: "She likes the police, must be a fascist"

Interesting that you resort to lying.  

You didn't say you "like police".  You said  that it's "immoral to criticize" them (your exact words), even when their behavior is violent and unconstitutional.   That is the *essence* of fascism.  


 I can say the same thing about you and how you support anarchism

No you can't.  The anarchist position is that there should be no authority.  No one here is arguing that.  They're arguing for the police to behave in accord with the fucking Constitution.  


 









 Let me put it simply.  Zed makes a career of being an asshole.  He may have a point about how K RC needs updating, but he purposefully does it in the most obnoxious way possible, then *whines* when people call him out for it.  Fuck this guy. 




 Oh.  Well, that doesn't make you anti-gay, but I'd throw a whole lot of findings from biology at you to show you it's natural. 




 I'm sorry, I still don't understand what is meant by "don't think homosexuality is a right".  The plain interpretation is that you think we should outlaw gay behavior. 

If you're trying to draw an equivalence between people who want to ban private consensual behavior and people who protest police brutality, you don't have an argument, I'm afraid.  The former *is* a form of bigotry.  People don't have a choice about being gay, as many scientific studies have demonstrated.  On the other hand, cops not only have a choice not to be brutal, they are also required to follow the constitution.  You're comparing apples and oranges.  Anti-gay is bigotry.

 




  ... if I don't think homosexuality is a right

Huh?  So people shouldn't be allowed to be homosexual?  That sounds pretty homophobic to me. Just a wee bit different from complaining about systemic police brutality.  People aren't protesting the existence of cops, after all, just their unconsitutional and racist behavior.

 




  Yes I do believe it's immoral to criticize the police. 

An idea that is at odds with a free society, but [consistent with fascism](http://www.rense.com/general37/char.htm ):

 12) Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.



 




 Blacks are much more likely to be stopped and searched for drugs, [but are over 30% less likely to have drugs than whites](http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/stop-and-frisk-not-just-american-problem ).

That's racism. 




 Some studies say [camelcase  snakecase](http://www.cs.loyola.edu/~binkley/papers/icpc09-clouds.pdf ), others say [snakecase  camelcase](http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/ICPC2010-CamelCaseUnderScoreClouds.pdf ).  Hmmmmm. 




 Fuck Zed Shaw and his crybaby antics.  I stopped paying attention to him after [the nonsense he wrote about Rails](http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/ruby/rails/is-a-ghetto ).  

Unfortunately, I didn't realize this was from ZS so I ended up reading it.  The guy basically flames K RC for writing a book back meant to explain how C works, back in the 70s, that doesn't take into account what was learned since the 70s.  Then he starts crying about people attacking him.  What a fucking asshole. 




 Yep, and to boot, property rights don't exist without that particular kind of socialism.  Take that for a spin next time you're debating with wingnuts. 









  Bold claim.  Source?

Police overwhelmingly target minorities in stop and frisk searches.  Well established fact.  Google it. 




 You are wrong - these programs  have been shown to reduce crime in low income neighborhoods.  http://www.afterschoolalliance.org/issue_briefs/issue_CrimeIB_27.pdf 









  hug and lollipops?

How about programs that have been shown to be wildly effective?  After school sports, summer jobs internships, etc. 




 So let me get this straight, you're arguing it's immoral to criticize the police?

You really missed your calling... as a spokesperson for the Stasi.



 



















  Regarding bipartisanship, many were sick of the divisiveness of the Bush presidency and wishing for a more unilaterally amenable figurehead who could serve as a unifying figure.

I'm arguing that this thinking *is* the problem.  Until the Left develops an appetite for fighting, it is doomed to fail.

  Does the President really have the power anymore to direct the country toward progressivism, or to fight against the establishment for the concerns of his base? I'm skeptical...

This kind of defeatism is simply maddening.  Modern Democrats seem to have become expert at excuse making for why nothing can be done, an attitude which guarantees the prophecy.  By this logic, FDR could never have existed - or perhaps should never exist in the future.  If this is the case, why bother at all?  This kind of reasoning is tantamount to saying -- "let the masters choose".

But obviously, no one actually believes this.  The argument of the [weak, helpless, impotent  Presidency](http://www.salon.com/2010/06/21/obama_137/ ) is one that is constantly trotted out by centrists to move debate to the right. Somehow, though, that never seems to apply to Republicans.  The reason billions are spent on Presidential elections is that there is real power there: the power to appoint, the power to raise funds, and the power of setting a message.  On all of these things, Obama has largely used his power to serve elites.  Sorry, but to make excuses for this is to be part of the problem. 

 I'd vote for a thousand Obamas before I'd give up and go for Nixon.

So you are saying, in effect, that you'd vote a thousand times for [someone whose policies are to the right of Nixon](http://www.alternet.org/newsandviews/article/641730/if_nixon_were_alive_today,_he_would_be_far_too_liberal_to_get_even_the_democratic_nomination ).  What is sad about today's left in the US is that they lack the historical context to understand how far they've allowed our politics to drift to the right.  For example, look at Nixon's record:

* He implemented the first significant federal affirmative action program.

* He dramatically increased spending on federal employee salaries.

* He oversaw the first large-scale integration of public schools in the South (something the crackers where I grew up were none too happy about).

* He proposed a guaranteed annual wage (aka a negative income tax).

* He advocated comprehensive national health insurance (single payer) for all Americans.

* He imposed wage and price controls in times of economic crisis. This wasnt a terribly good idea, but it was the furthest thing from a conservative idea. Truth is, it was positively socialist.

* He indexed Social Security for inflation and created Supplemental Security Income.

* He created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Office of Minority Business Enterprise.

* He promoted the Legacy of Parks program.

* He appointed four Supreme Court Justices. Three of them voted with the majority in Roe v. Wade.

He didn't shield criminal bankers and torturers from prosecution, like Obama did.  He didn't push austerity policies, as Obama did.  He promoted universal care, instead of scuttling it secretly as Obama did.  He expanded Social Security, while Obama put together his famous [cat food commission](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2010/08/obamas-cat-food-committee-alan-greenspan-and-dancing-grannies-medicare ).  Progressives really need to wake up and stop reflexively defending establishment figureheads.  Kneejerk partisanship hurts us. 




 I think you're wrong about what the country was ready for.  Time magazine ran a cover portraying him as [the second coming of FDR](http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/2008/1101081124_400.jpg ).  A generation of new voters believed the message of Hope and Change and wanted to see a vigorous articulation of liberal policies.  Instead, we got Obama whose conservatism has dragged the Overton window far to the right on issues of torture and elite accountability.  His genius as a right wing leader is to have gotten much of the "Left", if one can call it that here in the US, to defend policies of bailing out financial institutions and giant corporations, failing to prosecute torturers and corporate criminals, vastly increased domestic surveillance combined with executive secrecy, a war on whistleblowers, and an absurd commitment to austerity economics at precisely the time all mainstream economists said we should do the opposite.  

Arguably, Obama has done more to unify our political discourse over far-right wing values than Reagan, his hero.  The result, predictably, has been an opportunity squandered --- a generation disgusted with both parties, and Democratic partisans who are now espousing policies far to the right of Nixon.  But to discuss that as a squandering of opportunity is fundamentally misconstrue what happened - rather, we should say he seized it, because he is, and should be regarded as, a right wing hero, who followed in the footsteps of Reagan.

All that said, I very much agree with much of the rest of your comment. Let's run someone who has a long track record of actually fighting for regular people.   




  Elizabeth Warren is right of Obama. 

Pure Hogwash.

 She's a Israeli loving a former Republican.  Paid for politician like them all. Only Sanders has been consistent for 30 years+.

You must have missed [this](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2014/08/20/answering-question-on-israel-bernie-sanders-tells-townhall-hecklers-to-shut-up/ ). 




 Quite right - the reliable partisan voter makes one thing clear: he can be ignored without any consequences. 




 E.g., Israel. 




 Until progressives learn to nominate fighters they are doomed to lose. 




 You are right to ask me for that source, but I cannot provide it.  I distinctly remember posting it here on Reddit back in the primaries, and discussing it extensively. I have tried, in vain, to find it. 




 Agree that there's a difference, but Obama is not by any stretch *moderate*.  He is a right wing conservative.  He's [to the right of Nixon](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/obama-is-a-republican/ ) on any number of issues, and [it's arguable that he's to the right of Reagan](http://my.firedoglake.com/cenkuygur/tag/ronald-reagan/ ).

 




 Mmm... nothing makes conspiracy theories better than spelling mistakes.   I am convinced! 




 Share your frustration with Ds, but you should read this:
[Differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2pwhvt/the_differences_between_the_democratic_party_and/ ) 




 I hope she does too, but Sanders is excellent. 




 I am talking about the primaries. 




 That is really great.  I have a lot of faith in Sanders.  He has a long career of being an unabashed fighter for regular people.  I've sent money several times.  I'm still waiting to see whether Warren will throw her hat in, simply for the reason that her messaging is sharper.  But either of them at the top of the ticket would be a great thing for the country. 




 I don't know what to tell you --- politicians are adept at telling people what they want to hear.   But his speech at Kerry's nominating was the first clue for me.  It argued, in essence, for bipartisanship, precisely the wrong idea in the face of growing radicalism on the right -- yet so many on the left foolishly ate that message up.  

I don't blame Obama.  Opportunists like him will always exist.  There is a reason that the neoliberals in the DLC got behind him.  They needed a friendly face on their agenda, and found someone who could reliably deliver it.  There will be another and another, because there is a market for it.  

IMO, the blame lies with the base --- they lack the desire to fight and to elect fighters.    Obama was an absolute cipher.  And to me,  an obvious fake from the moment he arrived on the political stage.   I can only look forward to a bleak 2016 cycle when clueless Dems will nominate Hillary, after she vomits an adequate number of lefty bon mots in the primaries.  If she wins, Democrats will dwindle into further irrelevancy, and the base will get what it deserves.

 




 I have no idea whether the left will ever learn the lesson of fighting for what it believes in instead of negotiating against itself before the battle even starts.  If Hillary is the next nominee, I'm officially done with the party. 




 It is the result of of years of dehumanizing rhetoric directed against Palestinians -   not unlike the techniques used by the Nazis. 




 Only people who weren't paying attention thought he was a progressive.  

He praised Reagan, he supported telecom immunity, he supported Joe Lieberman over the progressive Joe Lamont, he even said people were misconstruing him as a progressive.  People fooled themselves because they wanted to believe flowery words about bipartisanship instead of looking for a fighter.  They got what they deserved. 














 A fascinating article that argues Hitler had a mental breakdown after being exposed to nerve gas.  Historians, is this consistent with other sources?  How well accepted is this theory? 
























 Natural functioning of our beloved market economy: create scarcity, profit. 




 I agree with the spirit of this, but I think it's easily knocked down by conservatives.  "It's not the government's money, it's *my* money.  The government *steals* it from me through confiscation."  We've all heard that before.

A much more effective argument is to point out that money and property rights owe their very existence to government.  That's right --- modern property rights are, paradoxically, a form of socialism.  We take social resources from everyone and give them to the police and judiciary, who in turn provide a free service for people who are said to "hold property".  They get free guard service and they get free enforcement of their contracts.  

So, when a billionaire is said to "earn" their wealth, it should be pointed out that the only way they can so unfairly divide profits between themselves and their workers is through the magic of contracts, and state protection for contracts is a free  socialist service, which specifically benefits the wealthy.  Another way of talking about that is to ask "Why should we pay to protect WalMart confiscatory contracts with its workers?"

 **Submission Statement**

How Vice is sourcing all of these way-out-there stories is beyond me, but they've been killing it, IMO.  As Americans increasingly serve a smaller number of masters, I'm sure more than a few fantasize about getting away from it all.  This dude took that idea all the way, and apparently quite happy.  In his words, 

 I love this peace more than anything.  I may not have belongings, or enough food or water, but I'd take this peacefulness over them any day. 














 Please tell me that's a screen protector and not the original plastic cover. 




 Seven upvotes.   Tango down. 




 The behavior of the police toward the mayor pretty much exemplifies their mindset: they are never wrong and anyone who doesn't kiss up to them like they are some kind of authoritarian demigod deserves punishment.  It doesn't matter that Eric Garner's killing was on tape.  It doesn't matter that  99.99% of people get indicted by grand juries, but copes never do, it doesn't matter that they effectively report to the mayor.  

They think they should never be questioned - on the street or in public debate.  That is a seriously fucked up mentality. 














 Cf. the [Big Lie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie#Usage_in_Hitler.27s_psychological_profile ).  




 It's funny that *both* wings fell off at once.  I wonder if it's related to [how spaghetti always breaks in three pieces](http://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/2qjpz5/breaking_spaghetti_confused_richard_feynman_i/ )?  Notice how the fuselage rotates - if you think of the wings as one long piece of spaghetti, the short piece over the fuselage rotates like the middle of the spaghetti. 





























 You need a link to that because no one has ever heard of it.  Republicans are always braying about how they are the ones who ended slavery.

It is a frequent trope of conservative debaters to claim that Republicans, "the party of Lincoln", have the proudest list of achievements as champions of civil and worker's rights.  This is a review of a book by historian Heather Cox Richardson who describes the switch from that big-government and progressive Republican party to the one we know today. 



















 Agree, Communism also wasn't implemented properly.

 Ok, which one of you is this.

  "But Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), in her jihad against Wall Street,  seems determined to devalue this accomplishment  and to make financial expertise a mark of shame for Democrats, rather than a source of pride."

Hard to take the author seriously after that opening.   




 In what way has MoveOn been peculiar?  You seem to be suspicious of everything, but you're not providing any evidence.  MoveOn has been raising $1M to convince Elizabeth Warren to run.  Or is she now part of the secret libertarian plot to take over progressive politics too?  Full disclosure - I'm friends with one of the founders of MoveOn, and I can assure you that no such thing is happening.  




 Upworthy was started by  Eli Pariser, Executive Director (i.e., non-profit CEO) of MoveOn.org, and is a co-founder of Avaaz.org, another very well known left wing site.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Pariser 




 I haven't seen a single article espousing neoliberal economics on Vice.  CATO/Reason/Federalist are rife with that stuff.  

They both publish anti-police brutality / anti-drug, but that could as easily signal progressive/liberal politics. 




 Vice is not Libertarian, not in the American sense. 




 So your best argument is the rantings of a [criminal](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-28/felon-forecaster-blogs-on-8-6-year-economic-cycles-after-11-years-in-jail.html ).  Cool story, bro'.

 Martin Armstrong is a self-taught economist who is starting to build an Internet following from an almost-empty office across the street from Philadelphia City Hall. Hes also an unrepentant felon who spent 11 years in prison for cheating investors out of $700 million and hiding $15 million in assets from regulators.
