 Are there sprays for this? That doesn't make a lot of sense. Wouldn't you need to force inject ridomil?

 




 How does it smell? 




 Surely the other side will listen to calm facts! 









 Charge your phone! 




 NOAA only had a warning 'til 12:45, sirens went off at that time for me. I think downtown is out of the worst of it. 




 Peace lily (*Spathiphyllum*). They tend to be hardy indoor plants. People can grow then simply in a vase of water, frequently with a "fighting fish". 




 Yep, *Gymnoconia nitens*

That sucks, but a nice picture! The fungus is systemic, so you'll likely have to dig out the infected canes.  




 I think it's very funny when people do find it important. There's actually a 13th now, Ophiuchus, because the stars have moved since the Babylonians. Astrologists would know this if they ever looked up. Seriously, if you think the stars contain your fate, look the fuck up once in a while!

Tl;dr: Caring about sign = totally undateable. 




 FYI, not associated with the project, but it is cool. 









 Albutilon is an excellent host for [Verticillium wilt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verticillium_wilt). So, you know, if it gets that then you know your soil has Vert. 




 NO Monocots! 









 Oh, and most of that pollen is pine pollen. Pine pollen has those two lobes that make it look a bit like mickey mouse. 




 Not pollen. You have some trichomes (pronounced "try-combs"), or, "plant hairs". They are widely varying in shape, size, and function. Pollen will only grow one tube and doesn't branch. Google "EM of trichomes" to see how narly they can be and avoid some of the weed photos. (In the case of cannabis, the trichomes are glandular and produce the psychoactive oil.) 




 Neat photos. Those do look like roots. It almost looks like *Agrobacterium rhizogenes*. That's a bacterium that infects plants and injects DNA into cells. In this case, the cells go a bit rouge and make a bunch of roots. The disease is called "crazy root". No real treatment. 




 They're up. Cheers! 




 Invite some fundamentalism Christians. Also, be racist. 




 Sure thing. I have it up for sale right now on Shapeways:

https://www.shapeways.com/designer/footthong

They can handle volume way better than I can, print in higher resolution, and have the option for metals. I'm still working on getting photos up, but they will make it the same or better than the photo I posted.

I'll put a redesigned version up tonight on the store page. Give it a few hours.

 




 There was a stump in my neighborhood developing a nice one. The city ripped it out last week. No chicken-of-the-woods omelet this spring. ;_; 




 Wow. You know, I've had a printer for a while now, but I think this is the first time I knew someone made my design, and within an hour after I uploaded. I just emailed you a *thing*.

Future's gonna be great! 




 Oh, and printed in ABS (PLA works) with 0.25mm nozzle and 0.1mm layers. 




 I have it for sale and download here:

 Is Dick Despommier a nice guy? He seems like a nice guy.
