 I'm looking to buy a gaming laptop, something I could store a ton of movies on and play games like skyrim on as high of graphics as possible, all within the price range of around $1500-1800.  Working on ships, I can't exactly carry a pc onboard, so this is what I'm stuck with.  Looking through the threads here, I was excited about the Samsung Series 7 Chronos H, but since this is the first time I've looked into a gaming laptop I really have no clue what to get and am open to suggestions from you guys.  Also, I've just read a bit about spinning disk hard drives vs. SSD, but so far I haven't seen anything mentioning what would be better to have aboard a moving vessel.  It gets pretty rough out in the gulf, and I have burned through a few portable hard drives crossing the Pacific, so if any of you can lend some expertise in that, I'd def. appreciate it.
