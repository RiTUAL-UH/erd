 I glanced at Mr. Krabs and didn't realize Patrick was in front of him. Looked like Mr. Krabs was in fact a Mrs. 









 He has a teardrop under his eye..:( 




 One beer I think would be ok. Just all depends on your tolerance and body composition 




 Because they all effect the GABA receptor duh. Everyone knows this. 




 Oh fuck no bring back Pikachu 




 Hello there little girl..what's your name? 

MELINDA BROWN DAWKINS BABY! 




 ELI5: Is it just me or does not providing any support for terrorism in the last six months seem like a short time? And the "I swear we won't do it in the future either!" Seem sort of trivial? Or is it one of those things that you're not on the list until you prove otherwise? 




 Rip Marlins  




 How mad bro  




 These fucking inbreds think that because of recent events regarding police brutality that every single interaction is now a social injustice and against the law. The ignorance is strong with this one. 




 Modded halo 2. 10/10 would do again  




 Getting arrested at ihop haha these fucking tramps need to mosey on back to their double wide 




 She has the right to be an attorney  




 I wish his two cunt sisters got bodyslammed and he caught it on camera 




 Holy fuck I felt like I was watching Jerry Springer. The two drunk bitches were totally in the wrong. Lucky that cop had such patience. He could have fucked those women up for resisting arrest and being so belligerent.

 Cock bloodletting 




 Hung like a light switch

 Lol two shitbags who couldn't make it in the real army  




 You're gonna like the way you look  




 I know its stupid of me to say but ships sinking in the 21st century just blows my mind. That first picture looks like something out of a Michael Bay movie  




 Apparently a 'haunted house' where you're kidnapped and assaulted for hours.. 




 Who tha Fuck tricks out a Buick besides this guy? 




 It's all about those circadian rhythms and rem sleep, mayne! 




 Cross-eyed Easter Bunny smoked too much ganja  




 Dog years so only 2.9 years  




 The way you worded this hit me right in the teehee 




 Is your refrigerator running??!! 




 Or just watch Dexter  




 Sorry for your loss. God bless you. 




 Animals truly are a gift from God. Seeing stuff like this really crushes your soul when you can imagine how people could be cruel to such innocent creatures. 




 Instead they get to hide behind the facade of a business  and don't get charged with anything. The business just gets a slap on the wrist. 




 "The Fuck am I gonna do with this, Jack?"  




 Listen John I'm gonna get you out of there, OK!!! 




 Yeah that was stupid as fuck 




 They have these in Athens, GA too  




 Seriously this. I get promoting pacifism and learning to walk away and pick your fights but I know in some instances that's just not plausible.

 Yeah this. My pup has it. 




 Yeah I'd just Fuck her in the ass and go back to bed  




 I ended up getting the New Balance 940v2s and also a good pair of inserts. Trying them out this afternoon  




 I really wish Str8 would do well this tournament. Cloud9 as well. My money is on EG/CLG finals  




 You know what's ironic is that Martin Luther King Blvd/Dr is a popular street name in Georgia. And also usually in the worst/highest crime rate areas in the State. 




 The caption on that tv lol "Touch!...Explore!" 




 Lions really are some of the most beautiful creatures

 Best course of action would have been to walk your property with a weapon. Showing anyone who is potentially hiding you are armed and not afraid to use it. Worked in my case at least. Nobody fucked with my house anymore.
