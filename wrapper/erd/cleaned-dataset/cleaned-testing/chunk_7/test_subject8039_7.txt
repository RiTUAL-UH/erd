 A) I'm pretty sure it's a continuation, and B) why was it removed? It was a good story. 




 I just went to my GP 




 .......The fuck? 




 I don't have the books in front of me right now, so I could be remembering wrong, but isn't it stated somewhere that McGonagall told all the teachers about Hermione's time turner? If so, Lupin could've seen both, and just realised what was really happening.  




 I just want to know, why did the turtle have to die? 




 He sounds like a good man. Music is one of the most important things to hold onto. I wish you the best.  




 I'm sorry for your loss. What was your father like?  




 I would see myself living with my girlfriend, having become my wife, pregnant with our child. We live somewhere far away from here, whether it's Portland (we've both expressed great interest in living there) or abroad. Only seeing our somewhat messed up families on the big holidays. Surrounded by friends close enough to consider them family. 

Money and status mean incredibly close to nothing to me. Those things buy comfort, not happiness. So the house we live in would be big enough to support the family, but it wouldn't be overly extravagant.  




 So i actually figured it out.... but i know someone on here would've greed, for which i am grateful..... 




 So i have no idea how to create a post on my reddit to go app.... i made this post on chrome, btw... can someone please tell me how to create a post on my app?
