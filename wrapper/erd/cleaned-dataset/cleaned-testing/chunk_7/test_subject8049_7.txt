 It's like the tip of your penis before and after drunk sex with a hole in the ground.

Edit: I said "your" penis, not "my" penis.

 How many times will you have to tell Yoda to stop swinging the light saber in the house?!? 




 It's a great publicity stunt, at best... It seems as though we are living in the "Age of Awareness", where all of the injustices can be talked about endlessly with little recourse. We have unfortunately sacrificed all of our "power of the people" for a false sense of security and are no longer able to legitimately fight for our rights. Wikimedia, as everyone should know by now, has an unbelievably legitimate argument, but will get nowhere beyond awareness.

 I'm not the one who made the world what it is today
I'm not the one who caused the problems started long ago
But now I deal with all the consequences that troubles our times
I carry on and never once have even questioned why
I'm innocent
But the wieght of the world is on my shoulders
I'm innocent
But the battles started are far from over
We're not the ones who leave the homeless in the streets at night
We're not the ones who've kept minorities and women down
Still we grow and then the problems they become our own
We carry on without even realizing why
We're innocent
But the weight of the world is on our shoulders
We're innocent
But the battles left us are far from over
We're not the ones whose pollution blackened our skies
And ruined our streams
We're not the ones who made the nuclear bombs
That threaten our lives
We're not the ones who let the children starve in faraway lands
We're not the ones who made the streets unsafe to walk at night
And even if we try and not become so overwhelmed
And if we make some contribution to the plight we see
Still our descendents will inherit our mistakes of today
They'll suffer just the same as we and never wonder why
