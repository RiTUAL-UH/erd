 Full tweet:

When checking the game balls, the refs check the psi indoors. This is frustrating bc the ball loses some pressure in cold weather during our home playoff game this year I asked the official if he could check the psi outside again bc the ball felt flat and he said he could not. I guess you can't blame the official for that. Rules are rules. Maybe the league will make some changes this offseason. Sucks kicking a flat ball tho.  #BombSquadNonetheless

 Per source, OU has **not** offered the OC job to anyone. Bob Stoops still talking to candidates, including Lincoln Riley.

 It would be better if you spaced it out by the # of likes.  As in, the Cowboys should be on a different level, not besides the Steelers.

Or Seahawks and Raiders should be even, because both are 3mil.

 Including lost wages for suspension, Suh's discipline issues have cost him a total of **$474k**

 Appeals officer Ted Cottrell has rescinded the suspension of Ndamukong Suh, reducing the discipline to a $70,000 fine

**EDIT:**  For people talking about being a repeat offender:

The repeat offender policy was modified in 2014 in terms of what a player had to do to have a clean slate. After a first violation of a safety-related rule, a player must go 32 straight games without another such violation to have a clean slate. Includes reg. season, postseason and 2 preseason games. 

Suh's last such violation was in Week 1 of 2013, when he was fined for a low block. So he went the rest of last season, 2 preseason games, and 15 reg. season games.  That's 32 straight. So by letter of the law, he had a clean slate. 

Merton Hanks thought stepping on Rodgers was bad enough that even as a first offense should be suspension. Appeals officer Ted Cottrell saw it differently.
