 That's really cool about baltimore, I forget that Animal Collective is from there as well.  
Any other new names to keep an eye out for? 




 oh cool, thanks!  checking them out...for some reason kinda reminds me of Washed Out though they don't really sound the same.  Maybe it's just that immersive wall of sound. 




 Samuel T. Herring's stage presence is captivating...not sure I've seen anything else like it recently.  Check out their 2014 performance on Austin City Limits:

 I was getting scintillating scotomas for a while over the past 5 years...shortly after moving to California from New England.  This is the first time I've found someone else who gets them.  Mine almost always would develop into a migraine, followed by nausea and then vomiting.   Super sucky.  However in the last year, I've greatly reduced their occurrence, mainly through stress reduction (they always coincided w stress and glare from sunlight).  Sorry for the overshare, just excited to meet someone else who has experienced this.
