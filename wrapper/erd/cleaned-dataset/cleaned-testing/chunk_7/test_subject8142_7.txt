 7 Heismans, 6 winners. Archie Griffin won 2. 




 OSU only has 6 winners, though.

 ND has plenty of attractive women. They're in the college of business. 




 I'd put Purdue up there. I see way more from my Purdue friends about IU losing than I ever do about Purdue winning. I'm half convinced that being a Purdue fan really only means rooting against IU at all times. 




 I'm holding out hope he plays for us. We're collecting famous people's children. 




 Yeah that was 93. 89 we would have won if the best loss logic they used in 93 were used.  




 We should have won in either 89 or 93. 




 I've never seen as many dirty blocks by one team as I have by the Niumatalolo led Navy teams. And I understand how the academies have to play, I don't have anything against that. It makes me prefer we didn't play them, but I don't hold it against them. My issue is that it seems like every year there's at least 1-2 plays like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcTaRThg2mQ). 




 Am I allowed to hate their coach? 




 Gary Gray was great his junior year. He was the only one on that team that could tackle. That one admittedly horrendous game against Michigan killed him. 




 Ah yes, the many different business trades. Who wants to actually make money though, that's for tools. 




 Can confirm this one. 




 We have a similar issue.... 




 What kind of 5 year old's favorite movie was Gremlins? That shit would have terrified me as a 5 year old. 




 I was, I graduated with him in May, he was a pretty good friend of mine. He's off in Denver working now, still trying to make music, though, so hopefully that comes through for him. Great guy. 




 All the time he lived next door to me. 




 Love D. Montayne. 




 Don't forget all the meth. 




 What are the chances of winning the lottery and dying the next day? 




 But Beiber clearly never would have been famous in 1993. That was when people had taste. 




 Nixon was a pretty solid president except for that whole Watergate thing. He'd also be a filthy Hollywood liberal by today's standards. 




 "It's really catchy, but I don't understand how it got so big." 




 Thank god for a real reply. The reason this song got big was the video though. A quirky video like that can go a long way towards making a song big. Same reasoning that helped Here It Goes Again. 




 When I first started playing on Xbox Live, all I could think was wow I didn't realize so many girls were playing Left 4 Dead. After about 10 minutes I realized they were all little kids. 




 With current technology, who's still worried about missing a show? 10 years ago I'd understand, but we have dvr and Hulu. No reason to skip out unless it's something live (sports being the only reason I have cable really). 




 This is definitely great for us, I just wouldn't have picked GAIII as someone who would be declaring. On the other hand, like Darius Walker, he's clearly not going to improve his stock by staying. 




 Basically it's better to have something that even might be slightly embarrassing than look like you're hiding something worse. 




 Caps Lock and Shift like a normal sentence. 




 Same with mine, but I was in a really liberal college town. By senior year more people didn't say it than did. 




 I think to actually beat out Stop Girl she'd need 3. Stop Girl has at least 2 subs. 




 He's a business, man. 




 They also need to stop asking questions like "Did you resolve to catch 'em all?" when clearly everyone will respond with "I can't, put out bank" 




 Fucking same siders. 




 For home games we get the visiting teams' refs. Away games we have our conference for non football sports' refs. 




 I still don't understand how that escalated. People seemed to be getting upset out of the blue. 




 Pauly D and Vinny were awesome and both seemed really chill. 




 For that matter, he has 47 million followers on twitter. 




 No one in the media should be calling out college kids. Just not classy. Professional athletes are paid and it comes with the gig, college athletes aren't. And if anyone shouldn't, it's Doug Gottlieb about anyone at Notre Dame. 




 Since when do we play well in the Garden? 




 Catholic schools. 




 I was once in line getting my picture taken for a student id. There were Asians in front of me taking pictures of getting their picture taken. 




 They've talked it to death for 4 years now, there's only so much left to say. 




 The Land of BMWs! 




 #HASHTAGSWAGOVERLOAD 




 He's actually having a pretty good year. Not lighting it up, but he's an ILB, so not a position where you make a ton of plays. 




 I thought the point was that it's delicious. 




 I have friends in their 20s who routinely share articles from the Daily Currant, only to delete them from Facebook every time they're told it's satire. I'm not sure if they actually read them or not. 




 I wouldn't wish Ty on anyone. Except maybe USC. They hired the wrong UW coach. 




 I'd prefer it be like the Bachelor. They can give out yellow roses. 




 Shit the Pasquerillas just donate all kinds of buildings. I think we're up to 3 named after them on campus. 




 Hey we just got our first Saint. We're on our way to getting a Pope. 




 How is that any different from your schedule only being as good as Auburn, LSU, TAMU, UT? 




 In fairness, last year was also just a weird year for QBs in the draft. There were a lot of QBs that were all relatively close in talent, meaning no one had to prioritize getting one early. Some years being the 4th QB taken keeps you at least late 1st early 2nd. 




 I've always wanted to start off all my sentences with "I'm not racist, but" and then just say whatever I'm going to say. 




 [Baseball actually has much more parity than the NFL, in spite of the salary cap.](http://espn.go.com/mlb/blog/_/name/stark_jayson/id/8908029/mlb-more-parity-nfl) I won't try to make a direct comparison in terms of teams making the playoffs with the NBA, because it's too hard to compare a league where over half the teams make the playoffs, but 12 of the last 15 championships have been won by the Spurs, Lakers and Heat, with the 3 that weren't still having one of those 3 teams making the finals. The Heat also beat the Spurs in the finals last year, so it had 2 of those teams. The 15 years prior to that only had 5 different champions, which brings us to the beginning of the NBA's salary cap era. We've actually only had 7 champions in the 30 years of a salary cap. In comparison, MLB has had 19 in that same time span. 




 In fairness, tuition also has a lot more it has to pay for as well. In 1938, you had to pay for basically teachers, chalkboards, a few administrators, and people to take care of grounds and buildings. Now, you have to pay for all the technology, which also means you have to pay all the people take care of the technology. Not to mention all the other amenities that most colleges have now like gyms, more extensive health centers, higher quality food and housing, etc that costs more. Yes tuition is rising at an extremely high rate. But so is the cost of what is being provided for students. 




 Only in the northern half of the state, unfortunately. I miss Meijer. Something I'm excited to have back when I move to Ohio in a few weeks. 




 He can just keep replacing Championship winning coaches. 




 If he wants to coach in 2015, too, that'd be ok. 




 Unfortunately I don't have access to the data on that, it's just something people in admissions have told me. And I know not all athletes are football players, I was just trying to say they don't let anyone in, even athletes, that they don't think can handle the school academically. 




 I was a business major at ND, so I had classes with a good amount of football players as well as other athletes. Some athletes may not have necessarily been as smart as other people in the class, but I never felt like they weren't smart enough to be in the class. Yes, many athletes get some help with admissions, but they aren't going to admit anyone who can't handle classes. Also, just as an aside, legacies at ND do worse academically than athletes do. 




 He was already redshirted, so he'll be a RS Junior. We don't actually call people RS anything at ND, but given that he also missed a semester of school, I'm not 100% sure what they'll call him. 




 I've never seen a better description. 




 I wouldn't put us as a top 3 job. The tradition is great, and depending on the recruit and/or their parents, the quality of education can be a huge boon. On the other hand, for a school with as much success as we've had, there's a lot of recruits we can't even attempt to go after, because they won't be able to get in. Not only that, we don't have any "athlete majors" where athletes can slack off and do nothing. Combine that with needing to recruit much more nationally, I still think it's a great job, probably top 10 or so, but not top 3 by any stretch. 




 I was hoping he'd at least go coach somewhere he wouldn't have to keep playing Navy. 




 Saban to head up the Longhorn Network? 




 I had someone once ask me where our CDs were. I told them we'd stopped carrying them a few years earlier. I was told I was wrong and should look in back, apparently for our entire CD display. 




 Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo? 




 We beat USC, too! 




 My favorite part of that was "Your'e still scared of terrorists on planes". 




 Tommy Rees, the man who kept Michigan State out of the MNC. 




 I prefer thunderstruck. 




 Funerals that are celebrations of the person's life are the best kind. 




 Hufflepuffs are particularly good finders. 




 He also bases his opinions on some form of reality as opposed to Skip. 




 This. You can't start a negotiation by starting asking for what you actually want. You have to give the other person room to get you to come down so they feel good about it, too. 




 He still puts out great music. 




 I could have sworn Usher did it, but looking now I guess he only had 4. 




 We just need to show coaching candidates the finer parts of South Bend. Fever and Backer trips are a must. If 23 were still open that'd be the deal closer. 




 Brian Kelly wouldn't know how to exploit a weakness in a defense if he found one, though. Unless that weakness happens to be their pass defense. 




 This is how I felt about Charlie Weis 4 years ago. 




 Who decides what's officially a song? Is there some committee I wasn't aware of who listens to things and decides what is and isn't a song? 




 They're already coming up with [ways to fix that](http://myfit.co/). 




 We actually compete in robot football. http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82a5defa/article/notre-dame-wins-inaugural-robot-football-game 




 Girls still wear dresses and knee socks. Someone's clearly never seen Halloween. 




 What the hell kind of high school only lets gym classes play sports 1-2 days a week? I thought that's what you did in gym. 




 On the other hand we have freshmen rushing the field after a god damn 3OT win over Pitt that we needed a miracle to pull off. 




 I was bored and did something similar once. Finding West Virginia Wesleyan's schedule from 100 years ago is a bitch. 




 Tennessee might finally get to sing Rocky Top all night long after beating Florida! Lane didn't lie when he said he'd make  sure it would happen. 




 They spent more fucking time talking about her than the game. It was awful. 




 It's how I've purchased all my games so far. And it fit my purchase history perfectly. Right all the way. 




 Red Gatorade and Jack, however, do not work well together, despite being sugar, sour and liquor. My freshman roommate learned this the hard way. 




 For a second I though it was McDonald's orders over $30, and was horrified. 




 And honestly, if you're Bryce Petty, do you really want to go there when Tyler Bray is going to be the same year as you? 




 Aside from all of our suspects being 6' tall white males with brown hair wearing grey hoodies, like everyone on campus, we had some great crimes (should be noted we have single sex dorms).

Guy was going through a girl's closet at 4 in the morning wearing nothing but a blue shirt.

A guy was exposing himself while on a bicycle, the logistics of which both confuse and impress me to this day.

Two girls woke up in the middle of the night to see a man in their dorm room. Upon them waking up, he left out the window. This was further explained to me by someone in their dorm, who told me they lived on the 2nd or 3rd floor. Apparently it went about 12 hours before it was reported, because they both assumed it was a dream. 




 I'm always the person that when I ask someone how they're doing gets the non small talk answer. Inevitably the person who I've met twice will tell me it's not going well and then tell me exactly why. 




 But it was mostly attended by Irish Catholics. 




 I feel like targeting is going to encourage offensive players to lower their head so they can take a hit there and get someone ejected before too long. 




 He gives me PTSD. One of far too many QBs that Willingham or Weis made look like a damn Heisman candidate.
