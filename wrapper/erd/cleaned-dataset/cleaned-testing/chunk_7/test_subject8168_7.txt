 Someone should stop horsing around. 




 Well, in the movie The Exorcism of Emily Rose, the time 3PM is knows as the "devil's hour".
To mock the Holy Trinity by being the inverse of 3PM with is known as the "hour of miracles".
Dark stuff is supposed to happen at 3AM
That's the time Emily Rose got possed with demons.

I don't know know if this may have some connection to OP's case.
