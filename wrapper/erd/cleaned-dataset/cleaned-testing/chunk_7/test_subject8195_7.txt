 Nice Steins;Gate reference username.  




 A gun rack would look better 




 Hey I got a hat like that lol 




 Alright boys this is a trial run of our first Instasynch night. 
Instasynch is a neat little site where there's a chatroom, and a video player. Everybody contributes to the video queue and votes on which videos to skip or to pass. 

Instasynch night will begin 7:00 PM CT (UTC-06:00) and end when everyone's bored. It'll be hosted in this room, http://instasync.com/r/A_irsoft.

Only rules are,  
1. Enough dank memes  
2. No spam (I guess?)

The playlist will remain locked until 7:00 PM CT 




 I'd say it takes a good balance of gear (armor, pouches, etc.) like any loadout.  




 I'd say hot and it can either look good or horrible, like hookers.  




 srry vorpie sempie 




 Nothing with pandas data analysis, didn't do any of those assignments in the class lol 




 Ayy the only coding I know kind of 




 Do the sites you listed ship to the US? 




 1. Where is it available.  
2. Will it be released to US retailers like Evike and Airsoft GI  
Those are my main two questions. Otherwise it's nice to see more unique and awesome guns coming to the GBBR world, and it's nice to see you guys at WE stepping it up. 




 Ew KWA 




 I don't get why it's racist. I guess I'm just an oppressive shitlord. 




 *Uhhh. Nuh uh.*
 




 K bb 




 Alrighty 




 Fun is an understatement lol 




 I approved you so your comments don't get deleted, no worries you probably aren't a terrorist rapist 




 Aight 




 Automod. Gotta post something or get more comment karma 




 Should I make him approved so he doesn't get his comments deleted..? 




 Oh yeah baby 




 You are welcome in the den of freaks 









 I got the original Oblivion game still in its packaging for like three bucks at a little card and game shop near my house 




 Vorpie'd be pissed lol 




 Who cares 




 [You activated muh trap card] (http://i.imgur.com/Gp2VYP5.jpg)

*Hnnnnnng* 




 b-bakayy lmao 









 *It's about the love of D A N K  M E M E S*

 S-senpai 




 INVALIDERIDNLAINVADLIDINV

 Oh it not as bad as other shows lol 




 Upotte was so weird man 




 SIEG HEIL 




 Uh-but-uh-and-so... **HK MASTER RACE** 




 Actually HK51's are my new favorite raifu.  




 Google 




 G36k trumps FNC-chan 




 *^^^^Too ^^^^bad ^^^^HK ^^^^trumps ^^^^FNC-chan.* 




 Yeah the short FNC looks amazing to me. Too bad HK trumps FNC-chan. 




 Well the short one and the long one are for sale on ehobbyasia,  
[Short one] (http://shop.ehobbyasia.com/gandg-gf76-aeg-short.html#.VYeWQPlViko)  
[Long one] (http://shop.ehobbyasia.com/gandg-gf76-aeg-long.html)

I think it was Reascr or one of you shits who like that gun fan service animu show lol

[Also found thissun'] (http://shop.ehobbyasia.com/gandg-gf85-gl-ak5-aeg-green.html#.VYeXN_lViko) 




 Sure. 




 "An" and "In" in this instance does sound a lot alike.  




 I Googled it because I thought that I was wrong and thought I heard it wrong the whole movie lol 




 It's Indominus lol  
Why'd I get downvoted lol 




 So the trick is not asking them to play OSU? 




 Nah he landed a date. The trick was no OSU.  




 Oh jeez, sorry lol 




 Are you selling the VFC 417 and the TM 417?  
The description says that there's a TM 417, but the album says it's a VFC 417.  




 You mean the "almost honey badger". 




 Being a connoisseur of the HK variety, I do respect that you have two G36's at least.  




 I love how real it seemed, because they didn't use music in the whole movie. Only the opening scene and the credits.  




 Weezer  
Weab shit  
Parker (decent Korean rapper guy)  
KC4K  
Modigs  
Madeon  
Alex Skrindo

Some of my favorite stuff off the top of my head. 




 THANKS XYSTED THANKS 




 [HK IS LOVE. HK IS LIFE] (http://i.imgur.com/Pmq1ccR.jpg) 




 Uh, which one? 




 So, a UK retailer or a retailer that ships to the UK?  




 He seems like a really down to earth and genuine dude 




 Oh yeaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh. ^^^^What? 




 Oh yeah same here. His interesting play style, efficiency with GBBR's, and good editing are a great combo.  




 I'm happy I saw a StoopsMan video here. He makes really good content, I just wish he made more.  




 Uh-whe-what? 




 Okay so 7:00 PM central time. I don't know universal time lol 




 THANKS XYSTED THANKS 




 I was wondering about the threads on the [Lonex M4 receiver] (http://www.evike.com/products/51385/) and I was wondering if it's automatically compatible with [Noveske NSR rail system.] (http://www.evike.com/products/43521/)

I was digging around online but I couldn't find any information. I saw [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/48636/) and was wondering if I had to buy that, or if I could just screw the rail system on the gun. Any help would be awesome. 




 I feel like the put that power in the series, and the harem power to kind of make fun of regular mainstream shows. 




 Probably, or somehow Bell is going to use his magical plot armor power. 




 Yep, let's say Thursday at... 7:00 PM or 8:00 PM whatever time zone I'm in or yours since it's the same? What is it, central time? 




 I mean, *probably* 









 I wish we spent more time in British Colombia, but cruises are always a pain in the ass because of how you have to get back to the ship and shit. I'd love to go back though some time 




 Sounds pretty cool mang 




 I mean not to sound like a weab, but the Japanese-y part with the stepping stones and creek and azalea trees was probably my favorite part.  




 Sounds cool. I went to Butchart Gardens which was really cool.  




 I loved British Columbia when I went.  




 Good starting point. 




 Take one more loadout picture with the operator beard. Then, you can put it in a frame and set it on your nightstand, singing longingly to it every night. 




 Ayy that'll work 




 There's like, 2 lol 




 Thursday nights would be perfect. Disregard gay smiley face 




 I'm not sure, I work Saturday and Sunday 




 Didn't see this post sorry lol

Should I just keep it open all the time? 




 *I'm gonna need a long gun-erm I mean a CQB gun with a bipod* 




 *I need a long gun* 




 *It's time to blow this scene...*  
*Right?* 




 I like the bipod that doesn't really have a practical use on a CQB oriented assault rifle.  




 TAR-21's aren't long. I mean, if you say "Oh it's bullpup so the barrel is long" then that kind of makes sense, but overall length of the gun isn't long. 




 I'm digging everything and I really dig compact ghillies like that. The only thing that kind of bugs me is how it's hunter camo. 




 Those scopes are sex. I saw one on the limited edition G28 that Umarex is selling. Looks slick, and it'd probably look sick on your 417. 




 I'm 17 and I'm only 5'5". I feel like I should be the one in your position. 




 Description please. 




 Aww yeah them /r/A_irsoft patches.  




 *Whoa* 




 Oh that's really interesting, thanks for clearing it up lol 




 ***Okay 3, 2, 1- Let's jam.*** 




 Ah 




 *I think it's time we blow this scene...* 




 Like keyboard cleaning spray? 




 Haven't you seen his turtle burger video? 




 On Evike and I think ASGI you can find RATech (I recommend RATech) and other manufacturers of NPAS systems which can be used to lower FPS.   




 Just looks like inconsistent colors, laziness with parts or carelessness, and an average long suppressor for the "DAE DMR?" look.  
It's a nice gun but by no means is it unique.  




 Good point. This is the first AR I've seen in awhile 




 Seems pretty average, rather than eccentric. 




 Prolly 




 By the end of my lifetime I hope that there's a VR first person shooter like in SAO 




 Oh yeah definitely. I'm curious to see what they'll implement to make the new game stand out of the crowd. It's gonna be hard.  




 I agree with the first sentiment, but I feel like it still sort of applies to the second game too. Far less so than the first, but it's still a big factor to the game's success at the time.  




 BUT DAE PC GUISE HALF LIFE 3 HALF LIFE 3 IS THE BEST GAMEME EVERR AND PC GUAIEIS KHLWEwU BvFdXCXwshJL  




 CRYEE LMAO 




 Oh I gotcha 




 I have a caramel custard flavored juice from White Label Juice. I know it has Diacetyl in it because they say there is. I'm seeing a lot of people saying they love diacetyl. Can you shed some light on what the diacetyl taste is when I vape it? I don't understand. 




 I feel like I've seen a scene from a show about vampires with a similar name and I swear there was nudity. Weird. 




 I feel like I know what show you're talking about.  
Is that the one with unnecessary nude loli tits? 




 Why thank you, it's my oldest and trustiest. 




 I've played milsim with full Condor gear and it held its own.  




 Condor gear lasts a long time, it's affordable, and it works very well for airsoft use. Before my Condor MOPC I used a Condor Recon Chest Rig for two or three years. Condor Gear lasts a long time and anyone who calls it lower quality is kind of elitist.  
It's not the highest quality, but it certainly isn't lower quality by any means.  




 Barrel? 




 Looks like it'd make a good sidearm to my [SPACE AUG.] (http://i.imgur.com/IUYQUFy.jpg) 




 It's not even a matter of tone, you just don't say stuff like that and keep it to yourself. People with Aspergers do stuff like that  




  That's really rude to just say stuff like that out loud when someone goes out of their way to invite you to do something.

 




 I have, this comment is just over the top 




 Even when I first invited you said just said stuff along the lines of,  
"Oh I guess I'll see it even though it looks like a pile of shit" or "Looks cool even though they'll mess it up"

That's really rude to just say stuff like that out loud when someone goes out of their way to invite you to do something. 




 Nah idk about that. He's just gotta be more positive and do more 




 Because you would've given it shit the whole time 




 Fuck it. /u/derpmurderpunch.

You gotta live a rose colored life mang. You houtarou-esque sonuvabich.  




 Yeah I won't say his username because he browses here, but he said something about the books and how the movie is gonna be shit for some reason. I feel like he's got depressive realism really bad because lately he's just turned into a cunt looking only at the bad things in everything. 




 I wanted to see it with a friend this Friday, but he would've made fun of it the whole time so I'm just going to wait until a decent torrent comes up. 




 Oh for fucks sake, I remember now
