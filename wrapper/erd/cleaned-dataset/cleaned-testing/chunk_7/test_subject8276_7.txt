 OMG LOL  




 WTF  




 All of them.  




 thats not the storyline at all LOL.  




 This show hates Black guys LOL.  




 The Revenant 2009 
 




 Cool which film????  




 LOL cool.  




 Your mom  




 Star wars I am actually most pumped for that one.  




 whoa youve seen him work???  




 I dont think I have ever read of him actually finishing a movie on time and with no issues.  




 Didnt he threaten one of his actors with a gun or something???  




 I think he said he has no interest in being a big star and he is content with just doing the projects that interest him.  




 Jim Carrey  




 My peers  




 Every time I watch a movie I look up the trivia on IMDB regardless if I have read it before or not.  




 reading the trivia for those ones is like reading a long essay too LOL  




 They are called Stringers I think and yeah its legal just everyone doesnt like you LOL. Its a good movie I watched it last night good performance by Jake and it got me curious about it.  




 Who is Alex trebek???  




 Yes but not for the shaw brothers.  




 We will find out in a few days LOL.  




 Ill check them out they sound interesting  




 This was already common knowledge  




 3 of those things??? WOW I thought there was only 2 sequels.  




 Maybe  




 Ive only seen one polanski film the ninth gate, I was thinking about watching some of his other movies but its hard to knowing that he should be in jail.  




 Most of his later movies are shit anyways plus he is a racist ahole.  




 Thats kind of a bad reason LOL  




 I was thinking of seeing maps to the stars but I didnt know he was in it oh well I guess I will watch my second movie of him.  




 Thats pretty much me too.  




 Robert Patinson because I never liked him and I have only ever seen one movie with him harry Potter.  




 I remember seeing the previews and stuff when it was first released and thinking it was a ghost film or something instead its about deacon frost wanting his old house back.  




 Yes LOL  




 The Invisible 2007, its almost like a completely different movie than the trailer shows.  




 Fuck You  




 theyve teamed up before cool!!!!!!  









 Cool  




 I was hoping he would keep doing them and keep doing them.  




 Im sure they will all be remembered.  




 The last 20 minutes of that have always made me sad as hell.  




 It would have been a completely different movie and yes The Joker would return though not as the main villain again. God I wish he hadnt passed away it would have been so epic to see him come back as The Joker.  




 Awesome!!!! I thought Disney gave up on this project but no LOL 




 I saw it on Netflix and was thinking of watching it soon wow thats weird LOL.  




 Ite been rumored for awhile now that he will die in it.  




 Interesting  




 I have seen my all time favorite film exactly 8 times. I tend to watch it once a year only because I dont want it to get stale. 




 I had a black one it was awesome!!!!  




 Sounds about right they seem to act a lot like themselves and stuff plus the music thing LOL.  




 WOW how did I not get this already.  




 Saw it earlier it was pretty good like an R Rated South African Short Circut movie. I will probably see it again but man was Die Antword annoying.  




 Ive watched a few if them from those times the ones I have watched never dissapoint.  




 5 or 6 per week and at least 2 a week in the cinema I also keep track of every movie I watch there I have for the last 5 years. 
I like ALL types of movies but my favorites are action and comedy.
I like current movies like made in the last 10 years but occasionally I will watch something from the 80s or 90s.
 Last 5 were Submarine, Zero Dark Thirty, Selena, Iron man, and The Last Five years.   




 HAHA She thought she was gonna live ahhhh how cute.  




 Sutherland would be cool and Mr T, as well as Ron Perlman, and Michael Chiklis.  




 LOL  




 Saw it yesterday and I LOVED IT!!!!! A really good musical im glad I got the chance to see it in Theaters Anna is so great too I love when she sings.  




 man I cant freakin wait!!!! I have been waiting for season 6 for so long!!!! I will watch it on yahoo screen as soon as it is available.  




 Looks awesome!!!!! cant wait for two more weeks!!!!!!  




 I literally came here to suggest this wow you beat me to it.  




 Yes indeed.  




 Well he is the president he is so bust nowadays.  




 Yeah true.  




 The once a week is better IMO I mean I like House of cards and all of the episodes at once. It just spreads it out more I guess.  




 HMMM Alright I will do that I tend to like movies no matter what. And again I do love anna kendrick.  




 Interesting  




 To those of you who have seen this would you recomend it?? Its playing at an arthouse theater near me and I was thinking about going and watching it on my day off. I do love Musicals and Anna Kendrick.  




 Yeah he was important behind the scenes and most of his appearances were just cameos except for like two of them. RIP Leonard.  




 WHOA I thought he was on more wow was I wrong.  




 AHHH Man I that brings back memories of 1st grade for me.  




 He was playing a certain type one specifically for that film. I hope he at least becomes moderately successful in the business he just needs to do some more stuff.  




 I LOVED IT!!!! When I first saw the previews and stuff i wasnt really interested but when it got all of the oscar noms I saw it and wow was i blown away just like you!!!!!  




 I liked it it was a gimmick yes but one that payed off.  




 He had no cameo it was a major role.  




 I hope so at least a mention theres still time to shoot something real quick.  




 So far i have only read for 40 minutes at the most one of these days though I am gonna read for 3 or more hours at least. It usually takes me a few weeks or more to finish a book.  




 fuck you  









 ROFL  




 No Country for Old Men  




 Cool wish the other guys would return though.  




 Yes such a waste.  




 No that year was the last where they did 5.  




 Not even nominating The dark Knight for Best Picture.  




 Sorry to hear that, my bike was stolen in november I was so pissed. I just recently got a new one and this time i have two locks.  




 Probably dead.  




 Boyhood  




 Every year I think of this god I wish i could time travel.  




 Joy will likely get 20 nominations just like russels movies have in the past.  




 I wish they would change thijngs up at least one year they are always so frekin predictable. Other than that tho I liked them they were funny and neil was great.  




 Yes I try to watch most of the acting categories at least I never really get around to watching all of the best picture nominees though.  




 Riggan Thomson  




 Sad news I wish they would just make it already!!!!
