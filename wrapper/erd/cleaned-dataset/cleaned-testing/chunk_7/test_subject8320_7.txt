 So........ So.......... SO!! "So I finally used mods on FO:NV" no you didn't, you found those pics on Google and one of those pics wasn't even of FO:NV it was of FO3. It's just one of those little things that pisses me off to no end 




 It sure is! It's got that whole 90's thing going on  




 No problem! 




 I try to (along with some other people) some times its successful sometimes it isn't, I try to post more then just Hardstyle though  




 Long story short I talked to the mods and bam! 5 new flairs Angerfist's mask, the QULT face, the Defqon. 1 logo, the thunderdome wizard and the MOH logo 




 We have 5 new flairs! Angerfist's mask, the QULT face, the thunderdome wizard, the MOH logo and the Defqon. 1 logo 




 We are one..... We are many..... Resistance is futile...... Submit or be destroyed...... Join the QULT 









 sure I would love to hear some :) 




 Ophidan - Between the candle and the star

Round Wave Crusher - Unhinged 

Japanese stream hardcore - Japanese stream hardcore 4

Psycho filth records - 666 Over!! 

Deadmau5 - For lack of a better name 




 I'm a little dissapointed that you didn't push Kamiya for summer slam........ But hey at least you were able to PUSH RAGE and announce Rustlemaina II! 




 What kind of help do you need? 




 You see officer he shouldn't have said those things if he wasn't asking for it  




 Never stop....... Also holy shit the eyes have gazed into the abyss, the abyss gazed back and it got freaked out  




 It's culture and the sounds! If I could do a book report on the early rave movement I would be so happy. It just fascinates me how these people acted, dressed and danced, plus I could introduce my classmates to hardcore ;). As for the sounds, HARD KICKS! Doesn't matter what kind Hardcore, Subground, Early Rave, Hardstyle, Frenchcore, Hard House, Hard Trance, Terrorcore or Speedcore I'm down for it all! Another thing I love is how excepting everyone is, I'm friends with 4 of the 200 Ableton certified trainers out their in the world and while their all techno heads their always open to what I have to play

 Jesus ow... My sides hurt after seeing Matt just standing their with his mask on! 




 Yes! We must honor matts commitment to the cause! Also dose anyone else think he looks like a little gopher? He just pops up with a sign and then he just pops back down 




 matts rocking that beard! 









 Don't know if this is a forgotten track but Technoboy's remix of beat diz by the Hardstyle masterz is awesome (Italian Hardstyle FTW!) 




 I really want to see Pat on it, it would be cool to see him and TB talk PC (also seeing one of his babby freak outs would be hilarious) 




 Man..... Fuck activision  




 I would be down for this 




 * Bible black

* Full LP 

* 10 hours for main story 30 hours for everything (you get your moneys worth I guess....)

* Bible black teaches kids about religion, the joy of family bonding and most importantly staying away from drugs 

* Dan motherfucking yugi green is in it

Ok I kid I kid here's my serious one:

* Dying Light

* Full LP

* 28 hours for both extra and main content 

* dead island: the good version 

* I would love to see their reaction to the grappling hook and for those who don't know [Spoiler](#s "it's basically the just cause 2 grappling hook!" )  














 Put Pats lazy boy out of its misery by hurling of his balcony 

Put bags of rock salt around Woolie's place

Make Liam's body pillows come to life 

Rearrange Matts action figures when he isn't looking 

EDIT: I scrolled down and saw the stand thing, I would be a rotating stand! Every week I would change to a different user and I would have diffrent abilities! 

Pat: Help him control his anger and help him reach high places

Matt: Make it so he never drops things and give him the strength of the punisher

Woolie: Give him a salt cannon and make him not hate breakfast 

Liam: Help him overcome his fear of the booty and make his hair even more beautiful
  
  




 :D 




 Can we please get the thunderdome wizard as a flair? Thunderdome is a part of rave history and I think we should keep the memory alive with flairs! :) 




 [but don't you remember all the fun he had alone?](https://youtu.be/N3SNlRIak34?t=47s) 




 Oh man, I guess all that rage is aging Pat faster then we thought    




 More then you'd expect but less then you would hope! 




 Did you see his computer monitor?!? Holy shit it's beautiful! 




 Thank you kindly  




 Huh so it's like hearthstone card packs, one guarantied cool thing followed by 4 lame normal "cards"  




 Ok, I have a question! 

How is lootcrate? It's getting blasted in the comments but I've never heard of it before 

also can I get a a time stamp on the buscemi pic please? I can't see it ;_; 




 I agree with this! Ophidian I love you 




 OR OR OR! How about every 2 months they do a special 30 minute podcast with just Pat and Woolie as Chewie and Fuckface 




 Yes we are! Also can I haz links to the podcast where this all started? 




 What program did you use for this? If you say FL Studio I will hug you so hard.... 




 Now you know how PC players feel about bloodborne..... 




 Here's a link to the [article](http://www.polygon.com/2015/4/28/8507891/D4-Swery-Xbox-One-PC-Steam-Windows-Access-Games) 




 In an interview SWERY said that they were working very hard and to "please get exited" so I think that D4 pt.2 is coming but if you want to help him out some more, Bandcamp is a great way to do it! 




 Stand down shadow da edgehog! Your in danger of being able to cut through the earth and not care about doing so! 




 No one believed the mayor but at the same time no one doubted him. With sighs resonating through out the crowd the sounds of lighters followed by coughing were heard as the townsfolk walked towards Quint's home  




 Thanks for pointing that out, I'll be sure to put their actual name in from now on :) 




 A new decree from York! said Zach, York is the voice is the mayor's head whispered  Bill to Tommy the confused new arrival in town. Every Tuesday we will all smoke cigarettes outside of Quints house from 1:00 - 10:00 said Zach 









 Oh... That makes sense 









 This has been posted before but I just wanted to remind people. All the money goes to AGR, how it gets split is up to them, are these expensive? Yes, will you be supporting SWERY if you buy these? Yes :D 









 Dudeeeee I need bloodborne really bad on PC! I've been playing dark souls to try and shrink my raging blood boner but it's not going down 




 Pat - "Had to eat breakfast, it was delicious" Woolie - "it was pretty good" wait what!?  




 Goreshit is my hero, check out his GNB album 




 Yes!!! Can we please bug SWERY for an AMA on here? I need to tell him about how great this show called twin peaks is!! 









 but we still need copy's of atlas shrugged and sweater vests to make it official     




 I'm reading through the comments and I'm wondering why I haven't bought any games from GOG yet...... Move over steam my computer is about to become a lot more DRM free in the near future   









 Zatox   Mad Dog - Voilent  









 Welcome to the club friend! Pull up a chair, have fun, read the wiki and most importantly ask questions! We will answer :) also don't try to post any new episodes... Mike will beat you to it   




 In my dreams I see that town, a town I can never go to now........ Because it burned down *Angry tears intensify* 




 Shouldn't it be DB? 




 If D actually dose turn out to be Dio I will fly to Japan, find SWERY, high five him so hard that he flys back to my house, make him clam chowder and then take him on a tour of Wisconsin including places like Milwaukee, Door county, the dells and some of our natural parks where we will stay in cabins and ware plaid pajamas while a painting of a moose hangs above the fireplace. After our adventure his team will come over to do research and will make a SWERY 65 game set in Wisconsin   









 Ow.... That intro was baaaad, guys please play this and then play hunie pop 









 Many thanks brother 




 Oh.... Well forget what I said then, but the question remains "how do I have skully?" I don't remember buying any DLC packs for the game. I still am exited to see the firebug back in action at some point 




 6 months!? Holy shit that's fast! Although I am a little salty that DJ skully is a paid skin :/ but hey atleast we don't have to pay for things that matter! Can't wait to see what they've done with the firebug! 




 I remember after I bought rise of the triad on steam I saw the price on GOG. I was not happy 




 Yes... 




 DYK that Feed me = Spor? 




 We all saw the distance video and how hype they got over the music. So let's share! If you liked the music in distance then [check this out](http://youtu.be/NktEGEqkUz4) 




 I love this picture so much! its a glimps into a world filled with monster girls and waterways, plus their are so many little details  









 Worlds glanced in single frames are the best kind of pics! [This is another one by ~~her~~ him, it was my phone background for awhile](http://adriandadich.deviantart.com/art/Kitsune-364116397) 




 DONG! 




 WE NEED A STRAW POLL!!! 









 The sound a kick makes 




 You expected Chris Hansen but it was me Dio!! 




 What a lovely dwuang, but seriously though good job on this 




 many thanks guys! 




 I'm a pyromancer, what are the best weapons to start out with? Also even though I meet the strength and dex. requirements for the battle ax every time I swing it my guy looses his balance like hes not strong enough      




 [Digital Mindz and Riiho FTW](http://youtu.be/BJhcUfYStVI) 




 It was the first song to go to 1000 BPM, it got into the Guinness book of world records  









 Interesting fact about Extratone! Moby did the first ever Extratone song on his album Feel it/1000 




 Goreshit is my hero plus his GNB album is one of the best melodic DnB albums I have heard  




 Bro your triggering my triggers you sexist pig 




 You will be shocked why 




 I would also like to see how he dose his meander tracks 




 We all know Pats uncle is a huge scumbag, so tell us about someone you know who is as scummy or even more scummy then Pats uncle  




 Burn it with fire 




 This reminds me of that episode of 30 Rock when jack has a thousand year old bottle of wine taken from a sunken ship brought to his party and when they open it up its so fermented that alcohol fills the air and him and his guests spend the rest of the party throwing up in the garden 




 I guess you could say that's pretty..... Gucci Mane *ba dum tish* thank you I'll be here all week, but seriously I'm interesed to see how this will turn out 




 Ophidian  




 Listen to some of V snares other stuff, his composition skills are really good, some of his songs sound very.... [romantic]( http://youtu.be/FbJ63spk48s) 









 FTS by Showtek, it's a good song but it doesn't deserve to win  # 1 on the Hardstyle top 100 every year :/  




 LRAD was my first Bigroom song. One of my favorite Bigroom songs out their 




 I like the starting city idea, plus it would be cool to see fallout Japan costal, inland and Tokyo   




 Please do expand, telling your cool ideas is the whole point of this thread! :) 




 Am a Wisconsinite can confirm mutated moose would be terrifying  




 Let's hear your ideas! I'll go first, how cool would it be if their was a fallout game set up north in Wisconsin/Minnesota think about it. Instead of barren wasteland their would be massive trees and dense forest plus you could discover old summer camps and fight lumberjack ghouls    




 Basically it's just another name for happy hardcore 




 That's understandable, although it would be cool to see Gammer try again, monstercat needs more hardcore   




 I can definitely hear similarities, I'm excited for a hardcore vip of this if what you said is true  




 EDIT: FUCK! I ment to ~~wright~~ write Drumstep, my brain instantly goes to UK Hardcore when I think gammer ~  














 Have you seen Dio's VA's rsum? [He was bo-bobo-bo-bobobo and dead pool in the marvle kids anime!](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=662) 









 QULT isn't a genre, it's a lable ;) 




 I'm excited for this! He's got some great ideas for this game and he sounds like he's going to implement them 




 They still need to equip the hat... 




 As much as I want artists to do their own thing Showtek will always dissapoint me. I understand getting tired of one genre but they handled it so poorly, one day they were like "no fuck you guys were not doing Hardstyle anymore" they didn't wain off of it like Headhunterz  




 Nothing in particular. Jojo is just so hype all the time that it's universe couldn't contain it all  




 He helps me eat my cake 














 Sure thing! 




 I see your artist and raise you [Nukomasu](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=nukomasu) he also dose a lot of NSFW stuff but his landscape pics are [breath taking](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1864651?tags=nukomasu) 




 Ya dude! I get a lot of my [phone backgrounds](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1894848?tags=kklaji008) from it 




 AROO AROO MOTHERFUCKERS!!! 




 Weird... [Try this](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1801091?tags=jojo_pose) 














 Dnt lett any1 xtinguish ur flam 









 Fuck.... Your right  









 Getting my PC back from the shop today! I could use a little extra cash ;) 




 For sure dude, when I'm trying to tell people the difference between Hardstyle and Dubstep their just like "WTF are you talking about bro?" Also pro tip for people who can't tell genres apart! Listen to the kicks. DnB - listen to the kicks, House - Listen to the kicks, Trance - Listen to the kicks! 




 Based mods hard dance flairs plz ;_; 




 For all the people! DYK that TNT and Luca Antolini used to be part of the dark oscillators? 




 Oh great based mods of this sub..... May we please have some hard dance flairs? I have a few sugestions

 You can still buy them! Just search for phat pants  




 Holy shit Dubstyle 3 




 Exactly, maybe ask around and get an estimate on the creep/normal raver ratio. Still it sucks for these girls, they just want to have a good time and someone with no concept of personal space comes up and ruins their night.  














 Haven't watched this LP yet but I do know one joke from it! "My stand is hella cool" 




 I haven't played it and probably never will (PC user :( ) in DS1 I named my chick a
Astrid but now I would just make Dio so I could say "Your bricks are useless against my gun! Muda Muda Muda Muda Muda Muda Wryyyyyyyyy" 









 Damn, he looks exactly how I would expect him to look 




 [Brother!](http://youtu.be/MNxOfqxp64c) We meet at last 




 I was expecting a mash-up but wow it goes togeather super well
