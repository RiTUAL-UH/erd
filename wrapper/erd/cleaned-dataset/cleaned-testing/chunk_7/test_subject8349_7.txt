 Yay :D 




 No damn patch notes yet. 




 I guess they found another way to proper WaLMaRT :p 









 Huh what? 




 Yeah, that's pretty stupid and just kills the scene. By scene drama I meant the RELOADED-SKiDROW girl fights :p
Edit: maybe you meant [this](http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=672)? 




 Scene drama 3 




 You're absolutely right. I mean, Razor and FLT are almost 30 years old, I don't think anyone would expect the old guys to still be active. Even "back in the day" there were members joining and leaving all the time, judging from old NFOs I found on [defacto2](http://www.defacto2.net/). Nonetheless, dispite its ups and downs the scene kept being about competition and quality, which is lacking these days, for the reason you said.
Great post! 









 OK. Maybe it's a bit pointless to create a whole new sub just for Warez Scene discussions, but it's a subject that some people like me find very interesting.

I've even made a [small wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/warezscene/wiki/index) with a "what's the scene" FAQ in there. Nice read, if you'd like to know what it is.

Anyway, sorry for promoting this sub here, I hope the mods don't take it the wrong way. If so, sorry :/

Keep in mind that while you can discuss cracks and whatnot, posting them isn't allowed. 




 You can easily find it pre-activated in several public trackers. 




 Maybe check your internet connection. I guess Windows needs a working one to retrieve the new passwords you set. 




 thx? 




 Using a technical preview OS as main OS. What could possibly go wrong? 




 You can download an ISO from most torrent trackers. Usually you can find an activator there too. Some actually claim to be pre-activated. What's the Windows you want?

 Exactly.
Or... well... actually...
**FIFA.13.INTERNAL-RELOADED**
Note: This release is meant for our sites, its ops and users, and those who
request it. 




 The fact scene veterans could but don't is the main reason I made the thread. 




 I heard about it, and tried it once, I think, but it looks sketchy. It's cool, yes, but just think about it. A "cracked steam" allows you to download games with several dozens of GB, increasing some server's load a lot,  **for free**? Maybe it's legit, but I wouldn't take the risk. If you want my advice, avoid it. 




 All the very popular games still get cracked but with no demand for the smaller ones, scene groups don't bother

Actually, I see many meaningless Steam being released by the scene, while titles with lots of demand (FIFA 15 and Dragon Age Inquisition, for example) aren't released, not even [internally](https://scenelingo.wordpress.com/2008/07/16/what-does-internal-mean/). 
I think the increasing toughness of DRM is the reason. 
 




 There have been reports of that, but I think such cases are rare.

**Prototype.2.Proper-SKIDROW**
 So now we have decided to proper Fairlight's Prototype 2 release,
because our crack is fully reversed and CEG free. Which gives the end
user a more stable crack, with less crashes, startup problems gone,
fast loading, better framerates etc. are some of the problems that our
fully reversed crack prevents.

Worth mentioning that in some cases, properly removing DRM might actually improve the performance.

**Prototype 2 STATEMENT READNFO-FLT**

Here we
have Securom as protection, what is known to slow down a game's performance
in general, with more protection features activated, the more of a
performance hit you might see in theory. 

As someone said it, if the game is not updated (it's done manually, so there are many pirates who probably don't bother doing it), you might be playing an unoptimized version of the game. Fortunately, both the Scene and the P2P usually release updates.
 




 Not sure I get your point. Steam, Origin, uPlay, whatever, which you use to preload the game (and are necessary to play it) are DRM. That's the topic here. 




 Whether the P2Pers can fulfill my wish to play pirated games, it's sad (in a way) to see the current state of the Scene, compared to what it used to be. 




 Done 




 Demo division is still active (a couple of their members will be in Revision 2015 Easterparty). Not much is known about their warez division, though, but it might have something to do with their member dycus dying. **Rayman_Origins__RiP_DYCUS-Razor1911**:

He was the one behind many Trainers
    and without him even our few releases wouldn't have seen the light of day as
    he was the best game tester you could think of. 

This is also very interesting:
**Response.To.Our.Recent.Nukes
.SCENENOTiCE-WaLMaRT**
This is where we introduce **Cracker B**. The guy was
very well spoken and appeared to be very skilled.
He was able to patch CEG games for us in a fast and
efficient manor. He claimed to be an ex member of
Two other groups, which he backed up by sharing their
tools with us.
- SteamStub Unpacker Enigine 0.4 Win 8 Version
- Origin Unpacking Dumping Engine 0.2
These tools included an icon with a **Razor logo**,
so we can only assume they came from there. None
of these tools were used in any of our release, we
were making our own. Cracker B was purely showing
off the fact that he was in possession of these tools.
After some time we received another nuke, this time
concerning suspicions that the release was stolen from
a P2P source.
Tensions were high in the group after the nuke and the
member was soon banned. **He has since moved on to another
group with Cracker B**

Now, I have no idea if it's common for groups to share tools, but I guess it's not, since it takes a lot of effort to develop them. So is this "**Cracker B**" a former Razor1911 member? If so, I wonder what's that group he moved to...
 









 Steam games are the most popular, but they seem like the worst titles to crack if they want their e-penis to grow. I mean, everyone cracks Steam. Well, by everyone I don't mean just about anyone who can open a disassembler, but you can actually find some documentation about reversing Steam in the open web, and many, many P2Pers do it just fine. I actually recall SKIDROW mocking FLT for only cracking "lame Sims expansions" which only had some disc-check protection. Remember when Razor1911 released The_Settlers_7-Razor1911? They said they didn't care about cracking Assassin's Creed 2 for technical details, that The Settlers had the true real Ubisoft DRM, and thus they just waited. Now, if more games == bigger dick, they would have just released ACII... right? I think the tougher the protection the more bragging rights. But then why doesn't FLT start cracking harder stuff? I'm confused... :/ 




 Scene releases usually follow [some rules](http://www.sbytes.info/NFOwb.php?id=Rules.For.The.Game.Scene.Charts) that can actually mean better cracks. Most times you might not even feel the difference, though, since it's mostly technical stuff. Also, sceners can proper each other until there's a working release, and their reputation is important to them, so we're less likely to see poor quality stuff (SKIDROW doesn't apply to this, of course :P ) 




 Not necessarily, but that seems to be happening. 




 I don't wish we had less Steam releases. In fact, it's quite the opposite, since there's much more scene competition with Steam. My point is that protections are getting tougher to crack, specially if you follow the old scene rules, and it's easy to see that groups are avoiding such DRMs and sticking with simpler ones like Steam, which one day may be in danger as well, since DRMs tend to get tighter over time, not worse.  




 I don't think most downloaders realize what's happening in the PC-ISO scene. I haven't payed attention to it for as long as some you might have (let's say, since the early 2000s), but the future seems dark. I feel that there until 3-4 years ago there was a lot more competition. I mean, what's happening these days? FLT cracks nothing but a few Steam releases, RELOADED cracks UbiDRM, most Steam Releases and some Origin releases. Oh yeah, let's talk about the Origin stuff. Not looking good.

 FIFA.13.INTERNAL-RELOADED 

 Crysis.3.INTERNAL-RELOADED

 Crysis.3.Crackfix.INTERNAL-RELOADED

 Crysis.3.Crackfix.2.INTERNAL-RELOADED

 Crysis.3.Update.v1.2.INTERNAL-RELOADED

Not to mention The.Sims.4-RELOADED that was released like a month after the P2P release, and FIFA 15 that wasn't released by any scene group at all.

SKIDROW used to be annoying with their rushed P2Pish cracks, but at least they tried hard. Now they pretty much only release Steam stuff and get into little girl fights with RELOADED (check out Assassins.Creed.Unity.v1.5.Update.STATEMENT-SKIDROW).

CODEX looks promising, but I guess we'll have to wait and see.

And where's the old Razor1911 in all of this? Cracking Linux and OSX stuff from time to time...

Sid_Meiers_Civilization_V_Complete_Edition_Linux-Razor1911 

Wasteland_2_MacOSX-Razor1911

Wasteland_2_Linux-Razor1911

 XCOM_Enemy_Unknown_The_Complete_Edition_Linux-Razor1911

What do you guys think? 




 It was a freaking lame-ass server emulator with random values. 




 "3 extra lines of assembler" - LOL. Shut up instead of saying that kind of shit. You probably think today's DRMs are crackmes from youtube tutorials. Those "cracker kids" are people who spend years learning Assembly and improving their Reverse Engineering skills. 




 Are you in Europe or the US? 




 Hello,
I'll be visiting London for the first time next month. Is it okay to address men as "sir" and women as "ma'am" in the UK? While I don't think "sir" would be much of a problem, I think I read somewhere that some women don't like being addressed as "ma'am" as it's usually used with old ladies.

Thanks in advance :)
