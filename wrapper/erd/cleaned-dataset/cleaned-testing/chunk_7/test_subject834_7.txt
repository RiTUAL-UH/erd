 No problem. 




 They've not yet become self aware, no. 




 It's been kinda progressive for me but it hit full blown(ish) suddenly a few days ago. And it pretty much feels like I'm an empty shell, like nothing really matters anymore. 




 That's what I mean by that it's kinda weird. Plus, it's an RC they can range in quality and stuff. I've heard of stories of people not feeling anything from a large doses but their friends black out. Have you tried any other benzo or benzo-like drug? Maybe try a different one. 




 Anyone else who comes on this post, I have a question; Should I see my psychiatrist? Even though every time I tell her about negative symptoms she pretty much ignores me and moves on to a different subject. 




 I'm starting to think that it's the illness and the meds just make it 10x worse, because I've not been on medications for around 2months and my apathy has just started to actually come back... Weird.

 




 I can also completely relate to the 0 sex drive. My sex drive went from pretty normal to pretty much -100 out of 100. I still don't know for sure if it's medications that causes it, because I mean, I've been off meds for around the same time as you (by myself, docs never, ever take me off meds). Schizophrenia can cause you to have apathy I guess but I'm really hesitant to go back on meds because they make that part worse. Also, having suicidal thoughts because of lack of a sex drive isn't good, you should see a psychologist (they can help better with that on a psychological level than a psychiatrist can, a psychiatrist are just licensed drug dealers imo)... When I don't have a sex drive I just think of it like, well, at least I don't have that burden anymore, even though it's a bad thing, if you understand? I'm pretty sure lack of a sex drive is because when your emotions are extreme lowered (apathy) you can't really connect with anyone else, could also be due to anhedonia which accompanies apathy nearly all the time. 

I hope you eventually start to get better.  




 I'm pretty sure etizolam is good for anxiety (although it is an RC "benzo", it's not exactly a benzo but it's extremely, extremely close).

Anyway, OP, I'm not all that knowledgable about etizolam but I heard that it's pretty good for anxiety, but I've also heard that it's kinda weird and can be heavily sedating and cause black outs with small doses to it's kinda hard to dose with it for anxiety... I think everyone's different with this particular drug (kinda like every other drug, I know, but this one seems to react differently with everyone).

Sedation - In terms of energy level alterations, Etizolam is extremely sedating and often results in an overwhelmingly lethargic state - Got this from [here.](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Etizolam).
So yeah as enigmaticdoge said, either stick with it until you build a tolerance or try a different benzo.

Edit: deleted because I accidentaly replied to enigmaticdoge. 




 No, I don't think I had a very big interest on the government trying to wipe out everything on Earth. But the lead up to the big "delusion" I had obsessions about it, I guess. 




 Can I meet you there? I don't have any friends in hell, I'll be new there. 




 I made a post not too long ago about how I was dealing with a shit ton of emotions but I just couldn't really express them even though I wanted to, so now I'm back and well, I don't feel anything. I should probably see my psych but I think she's still away sick. It's kinda like some part in my brain where emotions are kept was just swept clean, like there's nothing really there anymore. I mean, I still have feelings but they're extremely died down, for example; on a scale from 1 - 100 my emotions right now are about 6-12 (at the highest) and half of those at the lowest (3-6). I haven't been on medication for about 2 months now I think, dunno if it's that but if it is then, whatever, meds make this 10x worse.

It feels like I might be posting here like a diary, maybe no one noticed because my post are far and few between but whatever, have a nice day everyone.  




 4 grams CAN be lethal, yeah, sure (I still go with 127-130 per kg though). I was just saying that he didn't take anywhere near 4 grams, that's all. 

Edit: wrong numbers, sorry. 




 I fucking love Amsterdam. 




 Doing drugs as a hobby is the worst thing you could do, seriously, take it from me... For me for example, if I don't get any morphine I will seriously just go out and try and do random shit that would get me into a lot of trouble just because I was insanely bored (even if I was in WD's). If I couldn't get some morphine for even just one day, I would go out with friends and not come home for days and when I was out of that bender my friends would be magically gone, they went home days ago. Basically what I'm trying to say is that having drugs as a HOBBY is seriously self destructive because once you don't have that drug you will do anything to alleviate the boredom eventually. Not only that but doing drugs like MDMA that much will damage your brain, and don't even get me started on heroin, that's just not a road you want to take.

Being clean is a good thing you know... Yeah, yeah, I know being sober is really fucking boring but eventually you will have a hobby and build a routine out of that hobby and you'll eventually start to like life again. It takes time, maybe try a program like 12 steps (just keep in mind that it doesn't work for everyone), and/or maybe therapy. But yeah, even if sobriety is boring as shit, it's better than being self destructive and building your fun around drugs, because they don't last forever. 




 I wasn't saying anything about him fainting. The guy above me said that 4g is deadly, because he probably thought 400mg was 4g for some bizarre reason, so I corrected him. 




 The daily mail are just a bunch of mentally challenged people pretending to be smart. 




 I find the euphoria from methylphenidate to be like a 7.5 for 1 hour then it's all downhill from there. 




 He didn't take anywhere near 4 grams of caffeine though, or am I missing something? 




 Do they use Desoxyn in Europe (including the UK) because I've never heard of that outside of the US. It's mainly Amphetamine and Ritalin for ADHD and severe obesity. 




 Opiates won't exactly "kill your appetite" unless you use it chronically. The only reason it reduces appetite is because it slows down gastro-motility (and cause gastroparesis in some cases) and they also reduce physical hunger in the same way that they reduce pain. But I can say from experience that opiates won't kill your appetite like stimulants do, they might reduce it a bit but you will still feel hungry but just a little less frequently, and using drugs like this to lose weight is not only unhealthy but unsustainable.  




 That's great that you've been clean for 3 months, may I ask what drug(s) you were trying to stay clean from? Anyway, like the others have said, find a hobby, do something that's packed with adrenaline. 




 That's probably why I have severe trust issues and have to see a psychologist. 




 Thanks, mate, and yes the books are good. They have a great Scottish vocab (which is where I'm from). 




 [Yes, super saiyans are real.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xA0ZHEwU2Q) 




 Adderall is pretty hard but normal street amphetamine is pretty easy to get ahold of, and I like methylphenidate better anyways for some reason. 




 Don't ruin the dream, the dream will live on. Also I'm pretty sure all the Methylphenidate based drugs are on a 12 month ban. That apparently includes, Ethylphenidate, isopropylphenidate, propylphenidate, 3,4-CTMP, HDMP-28. 




 And it's not sustainable, they'll find out eventually (even if they're not overly suspicious). 




 Damn, your post didn't come up when I was typing that. Thanks, I'll read it. 




 Just get some Ritalin and drink alcohol. Ritalin is super easy to get in the UK. 




 I like to set people on fire too, don't you?  




 That little kid must've been like, "IS ANYTHING REAL ANYMORE?". 




 They don't for me. I have heard about that though, I've also heard that stimulants like meth also do that, they don't for me though. I still like chips and stuff over sweets. I've heard (on the internet) that opiates can almost put you in a hypoglycemic state, and that opiates make people have a reduce acute insulin response, so maybe that's why (but that's just speculation I think, feel free to do more research on that). I don't think it's anything to worry about though. 




 I'll suck yo dick man. 




 I have a pretty chronic, annoying and sometimes painful gastrointestinal disease (or just stomach, we don't know yet) that's not been fully diagnosed yet. It leaves me with low appetite, constantly shitting, (chronic) nausea, and feeling bloated after small amounts of food for hours. I feel tired, miserable and helpless but then you get these people that think they know how to cure it, even though doctors don't even know what the fuck it is (yet), or they tell me WHY I have it and somehow I end up with all the blame like I wanted this or something. Yes, because I totally wanted to become chronically ill. It's also super, super immoral to tell someone that they caused their disease, or that they can cure it with just 29.99 A MONTH, just fuck off you morons... If I could cure my disease on some stupid diet then I would do it but I have more sense than to hand over my fucking money to some low lifes that just want to make a few bucks on someone elses misfortune. 

(FUCK YOUUUUUUU ALL) 




 They actually don't usually lose intelligence, we might just find it harder to speak and get caught up on words and stuff but we do not lose intelligence.  




 They're all good.  




 Some of the stuff I'm seeing in the comments really disgust me. Kurt and Layne were both great, I personally loved Kurt more because I felt a connection to his lyrics, but can everyone stop acting like such immature little babies? Both were great, RIP to both.  




 OMG MY MOMMY SAW THAT... 




 I can't even imagine what life would be like without a washing machine. I'd have to hand wash my clothes, you're right, washing machines are pretty important.  




 It's Topiramate.  




 I think so, it's at least similar.  




 Yeah, at such a low activity that it probably wont have any interactions.  




 Actually, I'm starting to lose a bunch of weight which I'm hoping will make me feel better. 




 This should get upvotes because it's fucking hilarious.  




 Yes, he "shot himself". 




 And even if he was, diamorphine is definitely not OTC.  




 So, I don't think I've actually made a dedicated post on here, I usually just leave comments but I've been thinking about something lately and thats self-esteem, confidence etc. whatever you want to call it. 

To start off, I'm an opiate addict (morphine and a few others) and I started off like most opiate addicts, pain. Anyway, other than opiates I do take stimulants when I'm out with people to basically give me a sense of self confidence and obviously self-esteem, although it's chemically induced, opiates also give me this alien feeling of "confidence" that I've sadly never had in my life. I've tried therapy and gave up because it never did anything for me, I mean, talking about stuff obviously helps but I can do that to anyone without having to set up an appointment or pay money but the actual therapy itself does nothing. Drugs on the other hand, although it's considered "false", does help, they do give me self-esteem and confidence. I don't just have a low self-esteem, I have what you considered a shattered self esteem, when I'm sober I don't feel worthy of anyone elses care... I would rather do therapy if it worked, but sadly it doesn't, the only thing that works are opiates and stimulants.

So to my question, is it possible for someone to never have self confidence sober? As in, is it possible for therapy to never work and for people to have to have a chemically induced confidence and esteem?

If this sounds like rambling, I'm sorry. 
 




 ...

That's all I can say to this. 




 What the fuck? Yeah, and while you're at it eat some tea. 




 I never understood why. I always prefer opiates.  




 I just clicked the context button on reddit, am I doing it right? 




 So you should've said... "Test it AND buy rocks", not or. 




 Bu... But drugs are bad. 




 I'd rather E. 




 [This is what happened to thecheezed when he went out in the snowstorm.](http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/commercials/2006/12/IRN-BRU-Snowman-Flight.jpg) 




 Heroin looks like a daily vitamin compared to inhalants like this. 




 Renton is a reference to the main character in trainspotting, haha. I've been asked if it was a reference to Renton, WA... At least Washington is my favourite state. 




 Tramadol is strange. For some people it's their DOC and then there's others exactly like you. Probably because of the SNRI activity. I've tried poppy seed tea, but I can never find any that's not really washed.  




 How can someone say "the good cancer", since when is ANY cancer good? 




 I find it extremely hard to express emotions to other people, lately I've been talking to an ex (and we both still have feelings for each other) and I find it difficult to say what I'm feeling to her unless I get drunk. I don't think this has anything to do with schizophrenia (or maybe it does, I don't know) but I post here anyway because its one of the only subreddits to do with mental illness that isn't overrun by attention seekers. Anyway, I don't know why I can't express any emotion to anyone, all I do is huff and puff so that they know something is wrong, and then when they ask me, I don't know how to put it into words. Does anyone else get this problem? 




 I think you actually can in Canada, no harm in trying I suppose.  




 What don't you like about it? 




 Okayy? That doesn't mean he won't have a copy of the enzyme, I'm guessing you're talking about CYP2D6.  




 I always feel proud that Gordon Ramsay used to live like 5 mins away from me. 




 I'm pretty sure the 'thebaine' is pretty stimulating, hence why oxycodone is more stimulating than the morphine derived drugs, like heroin. So if vaping it reduces the morphine then you will feel more of the 'thebaine', I'm guessing.  




 "He was searching for whatever made him feel like he wasn't alone"... Speaks to me more than anything, especially right now. 




 God damn it, wangofjenus. 




 The main alkaloid in opium that produces effects is the morphine, of course it has codeine, thebaine etc. but it's pretty much the morphine.  




 I mean, at least we would have a real diet pill for once if we legalized adderall. 




 There's never anyway to be 100% sure.  




 Weed, Cocaine... Same difference.

/s - for everyone that doesn't get sarcasm over the internet. 




 Mixing depressants, especially alcohol and opiates is a VERY bad idea, trust me. 




 I bet the last thing on his mind is going crazy again.  




 The reason I don't want to go back on meds is because they make me feel even lower, I have a history of depression as well and I think I'm having some sort of episode of it, which in return might be producing psychotic effects. I don't wanna go back on meds when I'm depressed, mainly because I don't think it'll help the way I'm feeling. I don't even have any antidepressants and my psychiatrist is off sick. This may seem sad and stupid but this "depression" may have been triggered by a girl I still love(?), I broke up with her a few months ago and we've recently started to kinda see each other on the side again (and she's said she still "loves" me), the thing is, I don't want to see her just on the side. I can't express what I feel, so I just bottle it all up, when I try to say how I feel I just come out with a bunch of words that don't make sense and stutter and stumble all over the place. I don't know why I'm telling this to someone over the internet, but I don't really have anyone else.

The trigger for my "depression" (which in return has triggered some symptoms of schizophrenia) may seem stupid, but I feel like killing myself but I don't know how to tell anyone.

Sorry for a late reply. 




 Welcome to reddit buddy. 




 Same difference.  




 Can you see through the chairs? 




 God dammit, evanallmighty. 




 I always knew pharmacists were druggies.  




 At least he didn't go from nothing to like, fent. 




 So, I've been off my medication for a month or so now and some shit happened that really got to me, needless to say I can feel pretty depressed (even though I can't feel anything, I just know I feel like complete shit), I can't think, like all my thoughts are fuzzy, I don't know. I just can't think. I feel like I might be relapsing, and even going back into a depressive state but I don't know how to tell anyone at all, I feel stuck, like my thoughts are screaming for help but I can't do anything. 

Thank you, just needed to get that out there (even if it seemed like nothing and even if it made no sense).  




 Any nirvana song.  




 The only dealer is a pharmacist.  




 Sir, are you high right now?
 




 Medication can even make negative symptoms a lot worse. Including the flat affect and avolition.  




 And this kids, is why you never do meth.  




 I've had dreams where I take crack (never done crack but I think I wanted to at that point), and morphine because well, I'm addicted to opiates. I also found MDMA in a dream at one point too, but I never done it in the dream. 

I don't really want to do crack anymore though, lost that interest a while ago.  




 Lol, then why comment? 




 Maybe, just maybe, you just THINK you're making the right choices when drunk? 




 No, it will just give you severe autism.  




 Depends. I've been just given antipsychotics, and lorazepam (when I was inpatient).  




 They're pretty much just injecting morphine mainly, so it shouldn't be that bad.  




 Harming pets is usually a psychopathy thing, right? 




 She sounds spoiled as fuck. Why does a 12 year old have a phone anyway? What does a 12 year old exactly need a phone for? If this was me I would've flipped my shit and she probably wouldn't be here right now, so good job for keeping calm.  




 Two and a half men was good until they got rid of Charlie Sheen.  




 Opiates aren't unsafe to take if you're schizophrenic. They actually have antipsychotic-like effects. 




 People mainly want to go on a suicide mission to mars because they don't think that Earth has anything for them, they may even think they failed on Earth so much that they would rather die on mars. It's actually quite sad, but I don't think they're all idiots.  




 Your name is extremely accurate.  




 Eh, whatever. I still think we COULD make it to mars in the next 30 years though.  




 So I guess an off brand tylenol will get me suspended for a year because it might look like a prescribed opiate? 




 You're missing out bro, you're missing out. Pill binder is strong shit. 




 And it should be on every official (police, paramedics, firefighters even etc).  




 It's hard losing someone but it's even harder losing someone to heroin or any drug for that matter. I'm sorry for your loss, and I know it's cliche but it isn't your fault. I bet he was a good dude. Remember, try and celebrate his life and not his death.
