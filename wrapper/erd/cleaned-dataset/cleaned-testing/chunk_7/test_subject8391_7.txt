 It's a convenient argument for them -- no new national parks, less land restriction for the oil industry. That being said, there really does need to be a discussion about the chronic underfunding of the national park system and how to solve that ongoing issue so that national parks have the money they need to operate properly.

 Here are the [national parks located in Ontario](http://www.pc.gc.ca/progs/np-pn/recherche-search_e.asp?search= p=1 province=ON sort=). I wouldn't recommend camping on a free day weekend because it will likely be a zoo (if its anything like free days at US national parks), but it's a great opportunity to explore one of the parks in your area so you can see what it has to offer.

 




 It seems to be an issue with the Parks Canada site at the moment...those pages were showing the lists of all the parks earlier when I posted.

edit: they appear to be working again

 It's actually much worse -- this is the first phase of the study that included 40 of the 118 park units which are likely at risk. The other parks will be evaluated in later phases, so this amount is sure to rise. It also doesn't include the cost of lost land and lost tourism.
