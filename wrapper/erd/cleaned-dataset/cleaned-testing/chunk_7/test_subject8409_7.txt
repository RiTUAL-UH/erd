 **#7** The truth is I don't remember the answer. I once saw it in an Encyclopedia.  



















 Then Bava Kamma? If not I give up. 




 Nedarim?

 




  Chassidishe tale.

There's no 'Chassidishe tales' on the Gra?
 




 April fools? 




 I'm amazed at the amount of matzah the bakery donated to the poor. This practice is unheard of today. 

Edit: Interesting detail. The narrator on the clip says "when every member of the family has to drink four cups of wine **by special permission of the [Eighteenth Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)**".  Seems religious Jews were allowed sacramental wine and excluded from prohibition. 




 **#7** **[History]** Which Edit: [18th] (19th) century German Reform [Hebraist and educationist] (Rabbi) suggest speaking Hebrew in Sephardic accent? 




 **#5** 
And the other answer is clearly throwing rocks at cars driving through your neighborhood

LOL.

Does not putting on tefillin count as a [Beginner] answer? 




 **#5** Yup. I think its a Tosfos in Yivomos that the obligation only starts after you put on the [arba kanfos](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1718-arba-kanfot) and it's to put on tzitzis. Since on Sabbath it's prohibited one may wear it. There is still another very easy (just added [Beginner])  half-answer. 




 **#4** One is Mie Nidah (sprinkling waters).

Bamidbar - Numbers - Chapter 19:21

This shall be for them as a perpetual statute, **and the one who sprinkles the sprinkling waters shall wash his clothes**, and one who touches the sprinkling waters shall be unclean until evening.

 **#1** Also a  groom in the seven days of [Sheva Brachos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheva_Brachot). 




 **#5** **[Extra Advanced]** and Edit: **[Beginner]** (more then one answer)

What is permitted on the Sabbath but prohibited in the weekday? 




 Question is what else besides video are you unintentionally receiving from those sketchy sites.. 









 I guess one has to eat it. 




 It seems I am being misunderstood (maybe it's my poor English). 

If I'd be looking to write in another language I wouldn't be on an English-language forum. All I wrote was that I'm more proficient in Hebrew than English. I did not write which language is my mother-tongue. In fact it is not Hebrew as you assumed. My only disagreement is (if there is any) in quoted Hebrew text. It seems people downvote any Hebrew text regardless if it's written by the OP or it's a quote from the original text. And it seems even after a request for translation is fulfilled it's ignored...  

So my question is do they truly want it translated? If yes, why downvotes and no interaction after translation. If no, why downvotes on the qouted Hebrew text.

If the OP quoted Maimonides in its original Arabic text would he/she be downvoted? I doubt it. It's telling..

 [u/rhfno1](https://www.reddit.com/user/rhfno1)
sometimes people are not comfortable repeatedly asking for translations, explanations and such. Especially when they feel it's something they should already know

-
[u/WhatMichelleDoes](https://www.reddit.com/user/WhatMichelleDoes)
 many answered that they would if they could understand what was going on.

Please understand, it's very hard and time consuming to translate Hebrew text to English, even harder Hebrew scholarly text. It's not a simple task. 

When someone **does** offer their time and effort I'd expect the community to show their appreciation by interacting or at least upvoting the comment.

I believe this is not the case (I'm pretty new to Reddit and /r/Judaism and may be wrong with my assumption).

Look at it this way; Here I am on Reddit writing in English, a language which I am less proficient than Hebrew, while you are more advantaged in your English language skills. Should I complain? No, my poor grammar is nothing but my own fault not yours. Same should be when someone writes some Hebrew or Jewish phrases and concept..

**The minuscule discomfort that you may experience from repeatedly asking for translations is by far outweighed by the effort put in to the translation.** 
 
I think it's a very cheap and selfish complaint. Ask and you will be answered.
 
**Also, explain why someone should put in this extreme effort if their hard work is not properly appreciated?**

Here's an example of a comment with Hebrew/Jewish phrases and concepts [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/2zapfj/do_jews_believe_in_original_sin/cpiekr6) [[2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/2zapfj/do_jews_believe_in_original_sin/cpi1877), both downvoted to **0**


[I was then asked to explain in English](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/2zapfj/do_jews_believe_in_original_sin/cpieaof), [which I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/2zapfj/do_jews_believe_in_original_sin/cpieaof), no upvotes or further interaction..

**Is this fair?** **Do you think this encourages more translations?**

Edit: My only disagreement is (if there is any) in quoted Hebrew text. It seems people downvote any Hebrew text regardless if it's written by the OP or it's a quote from the original text. And it seems even after a request for translation is fulfilled it's ignored...  

So my question is do they truly want it translated? If yes, why downvotes and no interaction after translation. If no, why downvotes on the qouted Hebrew text.

If the OP quoted Maimonides in its original Arabic text would he/she be downvoted? I doubt it. It's telling..

 [Mishna Berura 1 - 11:61](http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49623 st= pgnum=44)

One may cut the Tzitzit strings to shorten them after they are tied to the garment (Rama, 11:4); however, **one should preferably not cut them with a metal instrument**, but rather with his teeth or other non-metal instrument (Mishna Berura 11:61).

Also I think there's a ["  (Shenei Lucos HaBeris)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Horowitz#Works) on    (**?**) which prohibits this practice. Will look it up later. 




 tie the ends of my tzitzis

-

The Shulchan Aruch (11:14) records such a practice, and the Rama (11:3) advises that this be done. The Mishna Berura (11:18), however, cites opinions forbidding tying knots at the end of the Tzitzit strings, and rules that one should refrain from doing so if the strings are properly woven such that unraveling is unlikely to occur.

 But.. but... THE ULTRA-ORTHODOX JEWS!! 



















 Correct. Of all other religions, Islam is viewed the most favorably.  




 does say in the torah that is say you must hate them?

No. The Torah predates Islam.

This is what [Maimonides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides) -    (1135c.-1204) wrote about Islam


Muslims are not idol worshipers at all, it has ceased to exist in their mouths and hearts, and they attribute the proper oneness to God with no blemish. 

Because they lie about us, and falsely accuse us of saying God has a son (did Maimonides mean Uzayr - Ezra http://quran.com/9/30 ?), it does not mean we can lie about them and say they are idol worshipers 

And if someone should say that they worship in an idolatrous shrine [the Kaaba], and an idol is hidden inside which their ancestors worshiped  this does not matter. 

The hearts of those who bow down toward it today are directed to Heaven [towards God] 

Regarding the Muslims today, all of them including women and children have ceased to believe in idolatry.

 Christmas trees  kill way more people in real numbers and per capita than Orthodox Jews and hot plates. And way more people who celebrate Christmas use tree lights per capita than Orthodox Jews use unattended hot plates.

  OPs misconceptions comes from Hadith and their Qur'an ..

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The last hour would not come unless the Muslims will fight against the Jews and the Muslims would kill them until the Jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say: Muslim, or the servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me; come and kill him; but the tree Gharqad would not say, for it is the tree of the Jews.

What makes these deaths even more stupid is that she wasn't even doing it to comply with Jewish tradition, but to make a mockery of it. Her children are dead purely because she tried to weasel her way around the prohibition against melakhah instead of either following it or ignoring it entirely.

 That's an assumption on your part. The Fire Department has not suggested this. Besides many use timers. 




 autofill.. 
























 about practices like the one that caused the fire

-

 Leaving hotplates on for a day at a time though

The Jewish Sabbath started at around 7 pm in New York and the news reports state the fire was at 12 am, meaning the hot-plate was on for less then 6 hours. This tragic event was caused by an electronic malfunction not overheating from overuse.  Using a tragedy as a platform for hate is despicable. C'mon, at least wait an till they bury their dead..

 31. Three bodies were found on the lower shelf of storeroom A-111 clad in blues and jerseys. This storeroom was open to fresh water pump room, A-109, which presumably was the battle station assigned to these men. The emergency rations at this station had been consumed and a manhole to the fresh water tanks below the pumps had been removed. A calendar which was found in this compartment had an **"X" marked on each date from December 7, 1941 to December 23, 1941 inclusive**.

It was a very difficult  salvage job and took time.


* a. Install a cofferdam patch over torpedo damage on the port side at frame 43-52. 

* b. Install a cofferdam patch over the damage to midship area, port side, frame 61 - 97.

* c. Isolate steering engine room area by watertight doors.

* d. Pump out the vessel, using about ten large pumps (10") to gain control over the inflow of water.

* e. After gaining control, stop off leaks into the hull and improve tightness of patches, watertight doors, watertight covers, etc.

* f. Apply Air pressure to tanks and voids on the port side to empty or partially empty those that were ruptured. 

* g. Pump out all intact tanks and voids on the port side and empty starboard tanks and voids correspondingly.

* h. Apply air pressure to flooded areas aft in order to reduce the amount of water in those areas.

* i. Remove all weight possible, such as water, oil, stores, provisions, meat, ammunition, personal belongings, 
furniture, trash, wreckage, etc.

 having sarin and using are two totally different things


Not according to International law. It doesn't have to be weaponized to be considered illegal.

"The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the implementing body of the Chemical Weapons Convention, classifies sarin under Schedule 1, a class reserved for lethal chemicals with few, if any, legitimate, applications."

-

The sarin Tokyo subway attacks killed only a dozen people despite it being released in a confined location with high purity

They were amateurs and were rushed and you are wrong on your assumption that it was high purity.

-

"Fortunately, the low purity of the sarin solution used in the March 20, 1995 attack and the crude delivery method reduced the number of casulties, and the presence of the pungent solvent acetonitrile allowed many commuters to detect the presence of the otherwise odorless nerve agent and flee the scene before absorbing a lethal dose. The use of plasctic bags containing the sarin mixture rather than the far more efficient method of aerosol dispersal also reduced the number of casualties... The death toll could have been far worse if the cult had had the time to prepare the attack."

-

Sadam used sarin against Iranian soldiers causing tens of thousands of casualties. Also some 3,200 to 5,000 Kurds were killed.



Well thank god the iraqis didnt weaponize fishing boats and have them shot out of cannons..

-

You wrote


even unexploded bombs from ww1. The difference is these couldnt be used for anythign 

suggesting Sadam's WMDs were less lethal then WWI munitions. 

I brought proof that mustard gass from WWI was still active in 2010, that it has a long shelf life. Sarcasm will not diminish the truth

You do realize that any attempt to shoot a rusting shell would cause said shell to explode in the barrel of the artillery piece, right?

Like I wrote before, the possession of the chemical agent is illegal whether it's weaponized or not. 

Had you read the report you'd know that some shells were still in good condition 

Also it is easy to refill a new shell or convert it to a crude bomb 




  Without Iraq, a large geographic barrier is present to U.S. military maneuvers.

The US military presence is well represented in the region even without Iraq.  Your assumption is absurd and not factual.

 Iraq has a lot of grownups capable of making decisions

And they made one...

Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki practically begged Obama for several thousand military personnel to remain, to train Iraqi forces and to help track down insurgents. But he stated that the Status of Forces Agreement that gave US soldiers immunity from prosecution under Iraqi law was unpopular in Iraq (especially in light of the reveal of abuses by US military contractors etc. of Iraqi citizens rights) . Obama wouldn't agree and decided pull all troops from Iraq.

 It's not up to the US who runs Iraq

That's not the reason why Obama pulled the troops from Iraq. 




 Also unions had an over abundance of Jews. I got a kick out of looking through Library of Congress archive and finding Yiddish signs in practically every picture of union demonstrations. 




 OPEC

NBC reported that the family believes that his coverage of OPEC may be related to his disappearance.

 There are many tales in Iraqi and Muslim culture of the Tigris River turning red with blood.

Here's some

In 1258 Mongols under the command of Hulagu Khan sacked Baghdad, destroying the House of Wisdom, the leading library in the leading intellectual center of the Arab world.

The House of Wisdom, founded in the eighth century, contained countless precious documents accumulated over five hundred years. Survivors said so many books were thrown into the river that the waters of the **Tigris** ran black with ink; others said the **waters were red from blood**.

-

Khalid ibn al-Walid at the [Battle of Mu'tah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_ibn_al-Walid)

....Then Khalid raised his hands in supplication and prayed to Allah:

"O Lord! If You give us victory, I shall see that
no enemy warrior is left alive **until their river runs with
their blood!**" 2

The Muslims renewed their assaults with greater fury; and Allah gave them victory. Early in the afternoon the imperial army was shattered and its soldiers fled from the battlefield. Thousands lay dead, especially in, and on the bank of, the river whose sandy bed was red with their blood.

As the Persian army fled from the battlefield, Khalid launched his cavalry after it. "Do not kill them", he ordered the cavalry. "Bring them back alive." 3 The bed of the river was soaked with blood ... but the river was not "running with blood" as Khalid had pledged!



1. Tabari: Vol. 2, p. 561.
2. Tabari: Vol. 2, p. 561.
3. Ibid.....

-

....Furthermore, to call what happened a "killing of prisoners" is an oversimplification. Normally they would have been killed in the pursuit, as had happened before and would happen again, with no questions asked. In this battle Khalid had pledged to make the river run with blood, so those thousands of men, instead of being killed in the pursuit, were brought to the river and killed. And that is all that there is to the episode of the River of Blood....

Not when it's filled. Some were.


Since May 2004, Coalition forces (CF) have recovered at least 501 pre-1991 Gulf War Iraqi chemical weapons - including 448 122mm al Borak rocket warheads, **many of which contain the nerve agent sarin** (GB). 

From May 2004 until March 2009, Coalition forces recovered 4573 **filled** and unfilled pre-1991 Gulf War Iraqi chemical munitions. The recovered munitions consisted of bombs, artillery projectiles, and rockets designed to be filled with sulfur mustard, sarin, or binary sarin

-

(U) The expected potential hazard effects areas resulting from attacks utilizing pre-Gulf War Iraqi chemical weapons depends primarily on the type and number of munitions, percent fill, and agent purity

(U) NGIC has conducted detailed consequence asessments on several scnarios involving the use of pre-Gulf War Iraqi chemical weapons (see table below). These munitions are assumed to function as intended - explosively driven, cylindrical-dissemination devices. Source-term modeling was performed... to determine the performance of the improves device...


(U) Agent purites + 15%, 25%, and 90%

 "[/u/yummyluckycharms](https://nu.reddit.com/user/yummyluckycharms) **Thats true for any weapon - even unexploded bombs from ww1. The difference is these couldnt be used for anythign and we're just being stored.**"

-

Wrong.

In 2010, a clamming boat pulled up some old artillery shells of World War I from the Atlantic Ocean south of Long Island, New York. Multiple fishermen suffered from skin blistering and respiratory irritation severe enough to require their hospitalization.



-
  "[/u/yummyluckycharms](https://nu.reddit.com/user/yummyluckycharms) **Furthermore, much of the ammo rounds that they found were so old, they dated back to the Iran/Iraq war and couldnt be used**"

-

 "[/u/yummyluckycharms](https://nu.reddit.com/user/yummyluckycharms) **The difference is these couldnt be used for anythign and we're just being stored**"

There were mustard gas and binary sarin which have a long shelf life. 





 




 Looks like the SAR group that was called to commit the search botched up big time..

**Meretz** leader Zehava Galon officially announces that she will resign from chairmanship in the wake of the election results. It looks like her party will cease to exist. 

That puts her party seats at **0**
