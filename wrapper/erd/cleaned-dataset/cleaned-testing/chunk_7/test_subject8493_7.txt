 *some* of them care about those things , plenty of others just want to provide helpful answers. I've answered lots of stack exchange questions and don't care about all that "is it relevant enough, did enough people reply/view this, is it interesting enough, is it truly a question blah blah -- all those are subjective; to the person asking the question and others searching for the same question later, it *is* relevant/important. The site didn't used to be so "snobby" and "elitist" and was therefore more helpful to the average person. I stopped contributing for that reason. 




 This ^ 




 They flag too many questions/answers that are helpful and of interest to "non expert" programmers, making the site less useful and certainly less friendly.  




 Russians are definite contenders. I'm not sure Iran or SA have the capability  




 Definitely which is a common saying. "Long live China"  




 I wasn't aware of the direct correlation between rank and price. Is that common for books?  




 Most likely "killing in a way that some westerners would not consider humane" became "torture".

 cidian. zidian would be  (dictionary of characters rather than words)  




 The question should be whether he did a good job or not. If he did, his former education or lack of it, is irrelevant. Plenty of incompetent people have degrees and vice versa.  




 Not so. You should see some of the environmental friendly houses built in Scandinavia  




 What? So the team that knocked off OBL just happened to die in a crash?  




 Don't confuse "trading partners" with "friends".  




 True. But since the china gov also has motive,  manpower and skill to pull this off, this makes them more likely to be the source 




 Good. Alternatives to Reddit will only help Reddit get better and/or provide users with more options. I generally like Voat so far, though the communities are still quite small for many subverses.  




 I've lived in China for 4 years and I have to agree that American police are much scarier than Chinese police -- that is, until you're arrested (I haven't experienced that) as there is less respect for procedures and anything can happen.  




 So Japan and Western Europe are full of criminals roaming around free?  




 On that we agree. I would never have paid full price - or let my daughter take out a loan for it - for the college she will attend  




 There is plenty of data that says otherwise.
