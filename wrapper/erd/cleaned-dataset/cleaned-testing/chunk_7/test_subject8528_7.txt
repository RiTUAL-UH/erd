 You might want to avoid using YouTube's stabilization feature/effect. When I attempted to watch your video I couldn't look at it for more than ten seconds without feeling sick.
 




 Atr is, basically, a mall that is directly attached to the Akihabara train station so the doors to it is a prime advertising opportunity.  




 The typesetting is wrong. =Isla

 = a (Sounds like "ah" in English)

 = i (Sounds like "e" in English)

 = ra (The sound for "r" in Japanese is the same as how it is in Spanish)

I'm not sure where the s came from, but that is Isla's name in katakana which is how it was written on the board.

---

Edit: Just for fun, the other two names are right but I'll also give the katakana spelling of it.

 (Zakku) - The , when it is small like that, is used for the repetition of the consonant after the character and it is expressed in as a pause which results in an emphasis.

 (Tsukasa) - It is interesting that his name is also listed in katakana rather than the hiragana/kanji for it as katakana is normally reserved for foreign words/names that are listed for japanese pronunciation.  




 Yep, if you go back to the first fight between Archer and Saber it shows Archer saying "Trace On" without being able to hear it. 




 k 




 That is closer to a TLC (Translation Checker) than a proofreader. Typically a proofreader is someone who checks just the English for grammatical errors and such. 




 Apparently the manga has a nutritionalist/chef on board in order to make the dishes sound, look and actually be possible to make while tasting good.

 As for the flair, even I'm not sure. My thought might be to list it under [Questions] rather than [Meta] but then again the weekly thread is listed as [Meta]. To each their own I guess. 




 **BOOM!** The end. 









 If the website I used to make a gif is right, it should go for 2 hours and then stop in accordance with /u/dabritian's wishes. I haven't looked to make sure. 




 As a heads up, you have the wrong flair on your post. 

You had: [Suggestion]

What you should have used: [Request]

I have changed it accordingly, but please remember to flair your posts correctly in the future.

 I'm 5ft 9in and when I went to Japan, I felt tall. Some of the people on my trip who were 6ft+ had to duck to get in and out of some places like Takeo had to. 




 Just giving you a heads up, there is a lot of drama in the series and some people feel as though it is forced. 




 Have you tried holding R while clicking on the save? It would boot you into recovery to which you can then install the CFW.

 [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUamHEvVQy0) is my favorite instrumental cover of *Cruel Angel's Thesis*. 




 Huh, maybe Steins;Gate isn't that far off. 




 Yeah, if I remember correctly that was the main reason the US Mint stopped doing that. 




 It is basically an updated version of the old US Mint airline millage method people used a number of years back. People buy money for a 1:1 transaction right from the US Mint using their credit card and then use the cash to pay off their credit card, keeping the points. 




 How in the world can you get from the US to Japan for $300? I could see how $3000 would work, but not $300! 




 As for a Japanese comparison, the *Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon* series could compare in scope as the first volume alone is thicker than some full dictionaries.  




 Do it! The HD659's are available from Adorama Camera for ~$275 right now and their MSRP is $500. 




 For those of you in Japan, it is actually a really cool museum that focuses on science and technology. 

I was able to go to Miraikan last year and it was one of my favorite museums out of the ones my class trip went to. (It is also pretty close to the 1:1 Gundam as well) 




 Some examples I have found: 

* The avatar for "god" in NouCome being that of the failed restoration painting.

* A character's avatar in *Asobi ni Ikuyo* is named "[Ender](https://i.imgur.com/3opJA94.jpg)" from the titular book *Ender's Game*. [A W Fast Food Restaurant](https://i.imgur.com/a3QzHTl.jpg) in the same episode. The teacher's computer is called [HAL.](https://i.imgur.com/paTy6ZJ.jpg)

* The book "Hyperion" showing up in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. 




 I've noticed that every so often, I'll find a reference to a piece of western media in the anime that I watch. 

What are some examples of this and what is referencing? More importantly, why was it referenced in the context of the plot?
 




 /u/automoderator  picks up a lot of the slack when it comes to smaller subreddits, especially with a set of well defined rules and actions. 




 Probably for the DVD and Blurays 




 I never knew that the guys behind CotN, made Incredibots! I loved that flash game as a kid and I remember making a number of rube goldberg contraptions in it. 




 You might want to give some more direction than just light novels, as it gives those who respond a better sense of what you like or would hold your interest.

In any case, you might want to check out /u/ugotmal's really good ["Introduction to Light Novels" post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/2z7yio/looking_to_get_into_light_novels_but_dont_know/) as it lists a number of good series that people have liked. 

Rather than a light novel, I'd like to suggest an OEL web novel series, ["Until Death?"](http://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/629) that is hosted over on Royal Road. (I do not normally read fan fiction, but this one was suggested over on /r/lightnovels and I really enjoyed it.) There is a prequel, but I would suggest reading UD first. 




 I wish he had used Hinagiku's old design rather the the "new" one. 




 This is more common in shoujo manga adaptations than from other demographics. So, yes, this is "allowed" in anime but shoujo adaptations are fairly rare nowadays. 




 I'm surprised that no one caught how, in the beginning of the episode, there was a single blue bird and a single fish but after the confession there was a couple for both the fish and bird.

The only issue is that one of the birds should have been a paler color rather than both being vibrant. (Normally the vibrant birds are males and the duller ones are female.)

EDIT: Same with the dogs and their handlers/owners. 




 It is possible, follow the guides but put the INSTALL.ZIP in the TNV folder rather than the game save.

You'll transfer the tnv save rather than the ape escape save. 




 You have to add it to the TNV folder not the game save. I had the same issue when transferring over some backed up PSP games that I own. 




 They have also done a few mobile games and such as well.  




 Not so much "Getting really huge", but there is always [White Album 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2). **Do NOT watch White Album** as other than sharing a song, it is not related. They are even from different source material as WA as a management sim like idolm@ster and WA2 was an visual novel. 




 Lets try and figure out if it is possible.  This napkin math, so it is only in the ball park:

----

Hours of anime per season (aniHour): (35 shows * 12 episodes * 23.5 minutes)/60 minutes = 164.5

Hours of anime per year (aniYear): aniHour * 4 = 658

Hours per year, including leap day: 8766

Approximate years that anime has been solidly running: 40

Total hours of anime so far (airedHours): aniYear * 40 = 26320 hours

Days to finish all anime (without catching up with currently airing) (curAirTime): airedHours / 24 = ~1098 (3.006 years or ~ 3 years and 2 days)

Hours of anime aired during completion (compCatch): 3.006 * aniYear = ~3952 hours

Completing that set: (compCatch / 24) = ~165 days

\# of Seasons while completing set #1: 165/(365.25/4) = 1.80698

Time to complete set #2: 1.80698*658 = ~1200 hours (50 days)

Catching up again: 50/(365.25/4) = 0.5475 seasons * aniHour = 360 hours (~15 days)

Catching up #4: ((15/(365.25/4)) * aniHour) = 108.09 hours (~4.5 days)

---

TL;DM: **3 years and 221.5 days (31596 hours)** of non-stop anime watching to catch up to what has and will be aired. This does NOT account for movies or other forms of anime.

Also, long running and dual/split season shows are part of the 35 shows a season. 




 Another tip for when you are shopping for stuff in Akihabara or Nakano Broadway, find what you want and make a mental note about it and how much it was but then go around the look for it again. 

Case in point, I was able to find [this](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/111864) Saber figure for ~$12 in one store and $29 in another and both of them were in Nakano Broadway.  




 /u/Internets might have only seen Amagi Brilliant Park, where Moffle was the main park mascot. (The author of FMP and Amagi are the same and they got the license to reuse the same character designs in Amagi.)

 Fell free to recommend visual novels unlike what some users might state. There are ~27.5k subscribers on here so more people will see it than other places. 




 I like these posts as often time the episode comes out while I am in class or away from my computer and it allows me to get a feel for how the episode will go when I watch it. 




 I've seen the horrors that are "Sanrio Puroland", I am still scarred by it. 

Imagine "It's A Small World" from any of the Disney parks, crank it up to 11 and then coupled with "Hello Kitty" stuff and put in all in Japanese and you have Sanrio Puroland. 




 Thing is, HMA is not a VPN but a proxy. 




 It looks pretty fun, sort of like a cross of Mirror's Edge and Distance/Nitronic Rush.

The key to this would be how the controls are as it could make or break this. 




 Yeah, I thought I got the F/Z soundtrack as well but I ended up getting the OST for the radio drama rather than the anime. Oops. Heck, it is still sealed at home. I guess that is why it was ~$3. 




 This is a little bit different of a request as it isn't, directly, of an anime.

What are some really good anime soundtracks that can stand on their own for listening to?

So far, I own the soundtracks to:

* Clannad
* Little Busters
* Angel Beats
* Girls und Panzer

I'm looking to get, sometime in the near future:

* Cowboy Bebop (All three soundtracks)
* Sora no Woto
* Suzumiya Haruhi no Gensou (This is the live orchestral performance of the OST and some insert songs)

Amazon.co.jp charges ~$12 per shipment overseas and $2-3 per item so I'm trying to save on shipping. 




 I wasn't finding fault! It is just that there are only three human moderators with /u/chiefnoah helping with the CSS and we can't catch everything.

(Thankfully AutoModerator is a lot of help) 




 When you see something like this, please report it! I only caught it since I was looking through /new/. 




 I never said that you said it was empty. My reply was based off of your "You need to put stuff there for him [the player] to find." to which I pointed out some examples that I know of off the top of my head. 




 The developers did put things out there for people to find even when the player has no need to head over there such as the chair and wine overlooking the sea to the cheese wheel shield on top of the hill in Crestwood. 




 You don't have to grind at all. The developers made it clear to the player that they are to keep on moving and explore the world. If you want to stay in the Hinterlands, good and it would be a massive grind but you'd have so much "power" that the rest of the game that they designed the player to see would be trivial and glossed over.

 What is cool about this is that you can actually find and run, in time with the song the level on your own. There are about three fail points and they are all early on. (Less than 90 seconds in) I remember showing this to people in high school on an emulator. 




 Here is a black and white'd then inverted version of this episode's end card if people want to see the line work. Link: https://i.imgur.com/uVb8NJ3.png

 I think they are wondering how Archer and the other guy can create numerous blades out of thin air and throw them over a long distance in a ranges attack.  




 If you are out there shooting, things will happen for you. If youre not out there, youll only hear about it.  Jay Maisel

EDIT: For some context, Jay Maisel is one of the more famous natural light photographers. You may not know it, but you have most likely seen his work. 




 Plus Asakura hummed *Hare Hare Yukai* while cooking in the last episode. They know what the fans want to see and hear when it comes to the Haruhi series. (Man, I hope this sells well enough to encourage a third season that goes past Disappearance) 




 If you like them, look into getting turkey breasts or thighs instead of legs. The legs have a lot of tendons and extra bits that makes it harder to eat. 




 Psst, if you ever want to know why you tagged a certain person click on the tag (like you would to edit it) and copy the link in the "link" section. That gives you the post where you tagged that user. 




 The manga is really good but sadly isn't available officially in English. It switches between regular manga and 4-koma as the need arises which is nice as you get the benefits of both. The art is really good as well. 

Source: I own the first volume in Japanese. 




 No, but he can scroll through the comments on his account and see how many times he has been asked that question. 




  That being said, I did think that something might be up when the show displayed the Yamaha logo without switching it to something else (Yamada, Yawaha, etc).

Well, Shigatsu no Uso had the Steinway logo and pianos in the show but I don't think Steinway helped fund the anime. Odds are they bought the licensing rights to the visuals and sounds of the various instruments from Yamaha. 









 Crazy thing is, they have the original voice cast so _____ is voiced by the same person. 




 The answer is yes, but _____ has a slightly different personality. (If you watch the first episode it is evident who I am referring to.) 




 When in doubt, go to one of the FORD topics:

**F**amily

**O**ccupation

**R**ecreation

**D**irection (Goals) 




 The only bad part about it is that there are only 4 routes, but there are enough developed characters to have 7 or more. (I think the fandisk has these routes, but they are not in the base game.) 




 I'm not the person you responded to, but I have heard good things about Private Internet Access. ($40 a year) According to Lifehacker and TorrentFreak, PIA doesn't keep logs of your traffic. 




 Second season started today! 




 Oops, I haven't seen the episode yet. (I've been away from my computer all day) 




 That is 3143.333 days of continuous operation. (~9 years and 4 months) 




 Pretty much wait for the thread by /u/shadoxfix to come out since he has a bot running on his account that will instantly post a related episode discussion thread.

 Better yet, while the osu!coin thing was an april fools joke, they added a bindable key in the "inputs" section to allow a faster retry than CTRL+R. Default is ~ (to the left of the 1 on a QWERTY keyboard) but I changed mine to Left CTRL. 




 I know a guy who is in his mid-thirties and he is still doing stuff like that. It is really sad to see as a college student that some people can't step back and see what they are doing to themselves and others. 




 There are more ways to obtain logins than breaching the servers such as people using the same password everywhere and their account login for another site was compromised. They could have brute-forced the passwords off of a known password dictionary as well. 




 It is slice of life and sports anime wrapped in a light-hearted fantasy shell with characters who look somewhat like animals. 




 Okay, who is going to make a new CMDR with a sequence of six numbers starting with the number six? 




 I'm fairly new to the game and I took a break for about ten months as I was busy or I was playing other games. I've only ever played against the AI and I was wondering how I could do better or improve my CS.

Lately I've been playing Ahri as mid, but I've felt squishy at times. What are some basic tips for someone who is new and plays Ahri? 




 I'm not the dev, but I have played against him multiple times and he was really receptive of the feedback. Heck, I noticed something fishy on the Arcade leaderboards, sent a PM on reddit and he responded and took care of it. 




 Not sure if you are being sarcastic. They are just doing that with the adaptation of *The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki* which is starting either next week or the following. 




 I'd like to win, it would help a lot with paying my tuition. 




 When I'm by myself, and sometimes when I think no one else is around, I'll talk myself through my schedule for the day or the next few hours. I've found that it has improved my time management, but I don't leave enough time to relax and if I miss or mess up throughout the day it makes me feel worse.

An example of what I say to myself: "Get up, get dressed, go to class, lunch, back to room, work on ______, go to class, back to my room, dinner, room." (Where tim in my room means that i am working on stuff unless I am done or it is too late to be coherent) 




 Through looking at the traffic on a recent post of mine, I found that a website is rehosting any and all content that reaches the front page of a certain subreddit. 

Is this allowed? If not, what can I do to report it? 




 If you want a story where the actual Roman Empire and a modern military fought, there is [this comment series](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k067x/could_i_destroy_the_entire_roman_empire_during/) from /u/Prufrock451 where he writes a story with this exact scenario.

Warner Brothers bought the rights to the story to make it into a movie, but nothing has come to fruition yet. There is a subreddit for it: /r/RomeSweetRome. 




 I have fixed your flair. You had it as "Suggestion" but the correct one was "request" since you are *request*ing show(s) to watch.

Please remember to select the correct flair next time. 




 Thankfully once you are through the mailslot, you don't have to worry about oxygen. 




 I wasn't buying rares, but hawking commodities 9ly each way for 1.5k a ton one way and 300 the other. 

I never knew about rares... 




 I am not the person you responded to, but I guess I did it wrong. I started out by doing commodity trading in a sidewinder then an adder and then a cobra. I recently decided to try fighting in RES and it is a lot more fun, especially since I don't have to toil away at making 25k credits every ten or so minutes. 




 I've found that following its recommendations for what squares to pick to be the best ones. (There is some liberty when it has multiple ones and they are in no particular order when that happens) 




 It determined, based on your entries, that the diagonal from the Upper Left to the Bottom Right was the best option to choose. Expected MGP is the average of the possible results based upon the possible unknown numbers. It just so happened that you got the 3600 MGP result, which is the second highest result in the mini cactpot. 




 Anything that pays over 100 MGP is considered a profit. Not every card has a 1 2 3 sequence in it. This program helps the user determine what is the highest paying row/column/diagonal to choose based upon the known numbers. 




 Considering the attribution along the top, probably none. I, originally, had this done and ready for people to use back on February 27th which was before these sites implemented his code. I didn't release it because I was unsure of what license he wanted the code to be released under. I released it now because it has been two and a half weeks since the last post from him and I am unsure if, or when, I will even hear back.

If that site is working for you, then great! 

The only reason people would want to use this code/program is if they wanted something that they could easily open rather than remembering to go to those types of sites. 




 The CS program here uses linux, fedora to be exact, and it is more so on the algorithmic side of things rather than the functional code that an end user would use. 

It is what it is, what I should do is learn how to do GUIs in my spare time since it would be useful.

**Nitty, gritty details:**

---

**Who am I:** I am a senior in college going for a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Communications - Interactive Media and Game Design. I have been using C and C++ for the past four years and have done a number of projects using the language.

A while back, I saw /u/Aureolux's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/2x7m81/i_made_another_cactpot_solver_web_app/coygzrs?context=3) where he posted a perfect cactpot solver with the hopes that it would be useful for someone. Well, I took the program and fiddled around with it and made it as such that the user no longer has to define their squares by setting the values within the program itself nor do they have the compile it multiple times in a effort to solve one mini-cactpot.

The algorithm is not ideal, but it can brute-force all of the possibilities within a second or so with a single square defined and after that it gets faster.

I've tried to make it easy to use. For example, if you had the number 4 in the bottom right, in the program you would put "br 4" (Without the quotes of course). **It does not have a GUI interface**, but prompts from a command-line box since I do not know how to do GUI stuff on Windows.

I contacted /u/Aureolux about two and a half weeks ago asking him what license he would like for this program to be released under but I have yet to hear anything. Considering that he just uploaded it online to mediafire and provided a link, I have put it under the MIT License.

**Downloads**

**Here is the link to the github**: https://github.com/test_subject8528/FFXIV_Perfect_Cactpot

If you just want the exe file, it is within the /bin/ folder. 

The [VirusTotal for the binary came up with 3 detections](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/39a6d4f639d17448e8e95e394a8b30d102da7ecd3f237eca046f7199a6b83c2b/analysis/1426565888/) from "Cyren", "F-Prot" and "Rising" antivirus. 

**The .cpp file is clean**, according to [VirusTotal.](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/5141b7e0d4d9c78cdf5503404246797129c4a618039f60e0c5afe3e765f59d41/analysis/1426566707/) Odds are, the three programs view the GCC compiler as weak or used to create malware enough that it just outright blocks it.

All I did was compile the .cpp file using [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) with the included GCC compiler. **If you do not trust the file, feel free to download and compile it yourself!** 




 Heck, doing "000[K|k]" (without the quotes) has blocked 99% of the gil spam that I used to get.

It has, definitely, made playing the game more fun since I am not getting a message every two to three minutes.

 I remember seeing this faction over in Brani and Cupis areas. 




 The bass part from Mozart's Requiem. It is useless because I was part of a choir that did it a year ago. While I can still sing it, I do not have any opportunities to do it right now... :( 

It is a fun piece to do as well. 




 You don't, necessarily, need an amp for the 650s. My old iPod classic can drive them pretty well. 




 Jeez, it seems as though every month or so someone has beaten the previous LoZ:OoT speedrun. 

I wonder when the first sub 18 run will come out. 




 The other issue with the piano is whether or not Steinway would allow the figure maker to produce a scale model of their pianos. Granted, grand pianos are pretty similar in design, but the fans who would be buying said figures would demand quality rather than a substitution.  




 How does the DAC in the iPod Classic (5th) gen stack up compared to Fiio's or other DAPs?

I've been running my classic with rockbox for the past few months now and I like it but I was wondering if there was something better that has larger storage capabilities through micro SDs and what not that I should be looking at.

 




 At this point, other than some of the backer rewards you aren't missing too much. I think Sekai will have the physical version available for people to buy when the game comes out and it will also be on Steam which means that you can get it on day one when it releases.

If you wanted the OST, it is available on the US iTunes along with Key's other CDs. (The only thing you'd be missing here is the booklet which has the lyrics, vocal sheet music, comments and the nice three cd case.) -- That is based off the Japanese physical release of the OST and may not reflect that of the Kickstarter release. 




 You can go in wherever, but the common courtesy that players have started to do is go in/out on the side with green lights to help minimize collisions. 




 Unless you only reddit from a mobile device. 




 It could also be stuck in the LA Harbor blockade/strike. A lot of imports from Japan are getting held up by that. That is why, in part, stuff like the WiiU Gamecube Adapter are hard to find. 




 It is, it is a what if _________ hadn't done _________ and it became _______.  




 It just happened to me and I am wonder how it turned out for others. 




 Not so much fan fiction but it is an official side story that tells a what-if when it comes to a certain event. 




 I guess it makes sense. I found it weird that the Federation had big red skulls outside their outposts.

It was just jarring to open the map and get confronted with a lot of red dots. 




 I just installed 1.2 and I went into the Galaxy map and every color is opposite of what it was in 1.1.

What I mean by flipped is that Federation - Empire and Alliance - Independent have swapped colors.

Federation used to be blue and now it is red. Alliance used to be yellow and now it is green.

I am using the standard HUD colors so this couldn't be the cause of the issue.


How can I fix this or is this something that FD purposefully did? 




 My thought is that if they found a massive issue while applying the update to the servers that people would still have the 1.1 client and they could revert the servers and allow people to continue to play. 




 It might be the surprise hit, but there is a lot of contention this coming season for AOTS: (Note that I am listing the big name ones, not what I feel as though could be AOTS)

* Disappearance of Nagato Yuki - (aka More Haruhi and it has the original voice cast)

* Fate/Stay Night - Unlimited Blade Works S2

* Gintama

* High School DxD BorN - (While it is an ecchi series, it has been hyped up quite a bit)

* Hibike! Euphonium - (KyoAni doing a music show)

* Hello! Kiniro Mosaic

* Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Vivid - (While it isn't popular on here, the series is well received and has a lot of fans)

* Nisekoi S2

* Knights of Sinonia S2

* Shokugeki no Souma - (Well received manga)

* Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru Zoku - (aka Yahari S2)

* Yamada-lun to Nananin no Majo - (Manga is well received and people like the characters) 




 That isn't too bad, about 20 more minutes. 




 /u/orniver is poking fun at this series compared to Bake*monogatari*, Nise*monogatari*, *Monogatari* Second Season, etc which are all parts of a larger story/series.

While *monogatari* may invoke that notion, the word "monogatari" means "story".  




  New repair sequence feature; if one of your modules is destroyed, you can cannibalize parts from another module to repair it.

This would have helped yesterday as I had my thrusters shot out by an NPC. (That is what I get for trying to run rather than fighting.)
