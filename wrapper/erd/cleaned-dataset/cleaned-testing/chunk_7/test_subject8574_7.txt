 No, he was never an employee of the school staff where Sam attended. From what pieces I could put together, he was a complete stranger who befriended my son at school. The school he attended had woods surrounding it, thus, from the only conclusion I could come too, Jon lured my son into the woods when they chatted. As I stated, I wish I asked more questions as to what happened at school and also as to who Jon was. I'm very sorry for any confusion I may have caused. Thank for reading. 




 I really enjoyed reading this and found it to be really well written. Overall, good job my friend! :] 




 I heard three knocks. Just three loud, head aching knocks and that was it. I got up and walked to the door. I looked through the peep hole and saw just an open hand in the field of view given. All four fingers and thumb sticking out widely, hand placed deliberately for me to witness. This individual was anticipating for me to look through the peep hole. Why? I didn't know, so I opened the door to see who would be standing before me. I saw no one, nothing, not even a trace of evidence that anyone had been standing there a minute ago. I was creeped out. A tingle down my spine and a bad feeling in my gut were all that accompanied me that night.

The next day I had to take my son to school, so I prepared breakfast which consisted of microwave waffles with butter and syrup as usual. The sunlight creeping up on me through the kitchen window was refreshing and welcomed. My son ate breakfast and when we were all packed up and ready to go I dropped him off at school. I drove back home thinking of work and the papers I had forgotten to hand in yesterday. My mind was completely void of everything else with the papers and more piggy-backing my brain. 

When I arrived home I got to work on my computer. I felt lifeless as I fiddle with files and write up reports. My routine, as you noticed through my little story here, was never interrupted for anything since nothing would stand in the way of it, but something did right then as I heard three loud, head aching knocks.

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

I got up and walked to the door. I already knew who it was, but to make sure I looked through the peep hole. Once again the hand was there, but this time the pinky finger was folded down. I opened the door quickly hoping to catch this sad excuse for a prankster. With the door wide open I once again saw nothing. This agitated me and left myself with an unsettled feeling at the same time. Who the hell was that and what the hell is going on?

The next day I dropped my son off at school again and ventured back home in my car. On the way to my house I didn't think about work, I thought about who was behind the door yesterday. I sat there at my computer with files open and blank reports in need of being written up. I didn't touch a thing on the computer, Just sat there staring at the work I needed to do. I just couldn't muster up the concentration, I could only think of the prankster who had kept knocking at my door.

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

This wasn't funny anymore, nor was it ever, but this joke became a lot more annoying the instant I heard those three loud distinct knocks again. Looking through the peep hole I saw the same hand that presented itself the last two times, ring finger now folded beside the pinky. But right then it hit me like a brick, it was a countdown. I opened the door as fast as I could only to find no one there. Now I was more than unsettled, I was mad. This mystery prankster was going to get one thing for sure, and that was an ass whooping.

I picked up my son from school that same day and continued on with the routine like nothing happened. My son would tell me of the things he learned and the adventures he had at recess. Today, he told me about his good mark on the spelling test he had in class and how this girl, Rachel, tricked him into rolling down the hill straight into dog crap. It always brightened the rest of my evening to hear his tales in school. He was about to tell me about the new monkey bar set they were going to install in the playground and how he made new friends, but it was getting close to bed time so I told him we would save those stories for tomorrow. I washed the dishes before getting myself ready to read a story to my little buddy before he went to sleep. Afterwards I headed to bed myself. 

Laying in bed I started to wonder who it was who knocked on the door everyday. When I thought about it, it started to creep me out more and more. You see, I'm a little bit of a paranoid kind of person. Things tend to easily spook me, thus, I tend to take things a little to far. Because of that the whole thing turned into a tremor in my head. It looked to be deliberately targeted at me, and that thought while laying in the darkness became a whole lot more scarier, but that's not the thing that really got me. What really scared me was the fact that this was real and that within a few days something was going to happen. Though, this was my paranoid self taking control. Yet, even when I tried to rationalize it, it turned into a lot more than a joke to me. I closed my eyes and did the best I could to prepare myself mentally for the day to come. After that restless night, tomorrow rolled in through the window and gently awoke me with sunlight. I was almost about to drift off back into sleep, but right then, 

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

My eyes shot out from my eyelids. Silence. 

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

I slowly raised my whole body out of bed anxiously. I didn't utter a word, nor even a thought in my head. All that accompanied myself was an uncomfortable feeling.

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

Well, what else could I do now but answer to the call. I walked from my room to the door, not checking the peephole, and answered. I was met with a little girl selling goods for a fundraiser. She just looked at me with a concerned gaze, so I guess I must have had one seriously petrified look in my eyes. I regained myself and asked what she wanted. She explained she was selling cookies door to door. "This early?" I spoke out in a droopy tired voice. "Early? It's eleven o'clock, Sir." Great, Sam is going to be late today due to me being a wimp and not getting any sleep. She left and I proceeded to wake my son up. "Sam, you alright bud?" His adorable bright eyes greeted me along with a yawn. "Ya, why?" "It's eleven in the morning, you never sleep in." "Eleven?!" "Yup, sorry about that. It seems your old man was a lazy bird this morning." "I gotta get to school! My friends will be super mad now!" "Wow, someone is full of energy today." My son proceeded to get ready and I did too.

While in the car it struck me as odd that he didn't ask for a sick day like usual when we were going to be late, so I asked, "Hey, don't you want a sick day today?" "If I did I wouldn't get to play with my friends!" "New friends?" "Ya!" "Okay then." Were the only words I could pull out of my mouth before I parked. "I talked to Ms. Renby on the phone so don't worry about having to explain why your late. Now, get a move on, bud. You don't want to be any later than you are already do you?" "I'm moving, I'm moving. Love you dad!" He smiled and waved at me before walking through the doors into his school. "I love you too, bud!"

Once I got home I went to work on the computer. A call came from my boss about a costumer complaining about a corrupted file. As I start trying to find the original file I hear,

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

I asked my boss for a moment as someone had knocked on the door. He understood and told me to call him back. So, simply, like the last time, I walked to the door. This time though, once in front of the entrance, I recalled the knocking. I looked into the peephole and sure enough, like life had smacked me in the face, there was the hand. Another finger, the middle one, had been tucked away into the palm. I didn't open the door at that moment, I just put my forehead against it and took a deep breath. Opening the door as slowly as I could I peered out from behind it. 

No one. I knew it. I knew that I wouldn't see the bastard who had been knocking on my door. That would be too good to be true. I sighed, depressed about that very detail. I couldn't just go back to doing my work, there was no way in hell with this obsessive knocking on my mind. So that's how I ended up watching supernatural until it came time to pick my son up from school.

When I picked Sam up from school I noticed he didn't make as much as a peep halfway through the drive. "Sam, is there something wrong?" He looked up at me and gave a smile. "No, I'm good dad." But when he returned his focus to the road that same smile quickly faded. "Do you wanna see a movie? Get some McDonalds?" He didn't even try to seem happy when he replied with a simple and quiet "No." I was concerned. "Are you sure?" With the same tone he dragged his next sentence. "I think I would just like to go home." I waited until we got home to ask him what was wrong. 

I sat my son down at the table and proceeded to ask him what the matter is. "Sam, you know you can talk to me about anything that's on your mind. I won't get mad, I just want to help." "Well, me and Jon got into a fight." "Well, what happened?" "He wanted to come over to my house on the weekend, but I told him that you and I had our guys night out on Saturday." I was about to ask why he didn't just invite him over on Saturday after our guys night out, or even on Friday night instead, but I had a better question to ask in place of that one. "Is Jon a good friend?" "He is really nice to me most of the time." I went on to ask about his other friends and, from what I could tell, all of his friends sounded like good people. I figured that the fight he had with his friend at school was a small one that they would get over and make up afterwards. After our talk Sam headed to bed and I would be getting ready to read him a story. When I was approaching my sons room I thought I heard my son saying something, but when I went inside his room he was staring in my direction awaiting story time. I shrugged it off and continued to read to him. Later, I myself hit the hay and called it a night.

As I'm getting ready to have a good sleep I turn off the lights. I hear something right then. What it sounded like were footsteps walking through the bushes outside, but these footsteps were as loud as loud can be. You could hear the rustle of the grass and the snap of a twig each step. And as they seemed to get louder than normal footsteps should, they just suddenly stopped. Turning away from the wall to face the window I saw a silhouette of a head peering inside my room. I instantly froze. they quickly ducked out of view. I ran over to the window and looked out of it to see who was there, but I saw no one. I didn't get a wink of sleep that night.

When morning came I didn't say a word to my son. I just made him breakfast and got him ready to go. Sam didn't say a thing to me either. Once I got back home I waited for it. I waited for the knock. I didn't touch my computer or take any calls coming from work. Those precious few hours were devoted to simply sitting there waiting for the sound to break through the silence.

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

Sure enough the silence had now shattered. I debated what to do. I could say I chose to not look through the peephole, but truth be told I just couldn't. I sat there, scared, thinking about the one who looked through my window and how the last day was tomorrow. What thought bugged me the most though was what would happen once tomorrow came. I never looked into the peephole once, nor did I open the door.

Picking my son up from school, I noticed he was oddly quiet. I thought it was simply the reaction he had given to the tone I gave off on the drive home. Thus, the day went on, but not before one last reminder of tomorrow that I had no need for. 

I made Sam dinner and sent him off to bed. I skipped story time since I had absolutely no drive to do so and went straight to bed. Once I turned off the lights it took me a minute to turn around, scared I would meet another silhouette. When I did turn around, I saw just that. I could feel my heart rattle while I tried to process what I saw in front of me. Though, as my eyes slowly adjusted to the dark, I could tell it wasn't a head. As it turned out, what I saw was a note taped to my window. I slowly made my way over to the window. I took the note down and began to read it. "I'm so excited for tomorrow!" This drove me up the wall in ways I could not comprehend. I threw the paper to the floor and jumped in bed writhing under the sheets with fear and a wicked headache. I just couldn't believe that whoever this was had taken the pleasure to assure me something bad is going to happen tomorrow. It took me what seemed like forever to get any sleep.

But I should've stayed up. At twelve in the morning I hear the most frightening sound imaginable to any person who would have to have gone through my ordeal.

*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*

I awoke. Fear pulsating through my veins at speeds unnatural to a human being. Shaking uncontrollably. Breathing sluggish. My eyes puffy. Vision slowly coming to me. Pure terror. This is what I had been waiting for, but It came when I least expected it. There was no trance. I knew exactly what I was doing. I got out of bed and made my way to the door. 

*Crunch*

Faster the fear pushed through my entire being. I look down. It's the paper. Before I can regain my composer I see a figure in my window. Right then, they were aware I saw them, and like clockwork, let out the most inhuman laugh I had ever heard. This laugh was one that took its time and crushed any courage that I may have had. I could never in my whole life put it into words, but I will never forget it. They ceased Their laughter and darted away from the window. Once they were no where to be seen outside, the knocking came even louder than before.

*KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*

I ran for my bedroom door to get to the front entrance. The only goal in my head at the time was to not let this person find their way in. Then this frightening realization clouded around my head. The paper note. It wasn't taped outside of the window, it was taped inside my room. They had already found their way in. I ran for Sams room first in a full sprint, but when I got there he was nowhere to be seen.

*KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*

I ran for the entrance. I tried to open the door but no matter how hard I tried it wouldn't open. I then looked into the peephole and saw something that to this day I have never forgotten. It was my son. He had a knife to his throat. I shuddered. The look on his face wasn't the look of someone scared, sad, or even angry. I couldn't figure it out. Why that face, a face that looked lifeless, a face that had looked destroyed, yet a face that conveyed something I couldn't pinpoint at the time. How could I? I was so scared. I snapped out of my frozen state and started to try and pull the door open while still trying to see through the peephole. I screamed and yelled, but my voice sounded so weak and shrill as it crackled pleads to let my son go. The stranger held up his index finger and slowly started to curl it into his palm. I started to scream "No!" over and over again in my same defeated tone. I was crying. I could feel my heart rattling in my rib cage as if it was about to burst right out from me. My blood circulated through my body at intense speeds. I didn't take a single breath. I trembled as I stood there unable to do anything. I was so close, right there, yet I couldn't do anything. I was scared, purely, and nothing else.  

His index finger finally clasped into his palm, and he did it. He grabbed my son's head and slit his throat. The man then let go of Sam letting him fall to the floor. Then the man walked out of view from the peephole, and as soon as he did so, the door opened. I ran over to Sam and plopped on to my knees while picking him up to put him on my lap. He was trying to say something, but he couldn't due to choking on his own blood. All I could hear coming from him were whispered gurgles as he gasped for his last breaths. How I felt could never be explained by anyone, ever. He looked at me in the eyes, and I could see him, second by second, fade away. All my memories with Sam playing in my head while I watched him die. And then, he was gone.

The police never found who it was, and they knew for fact it wasn't me. Why, you ask. When they searched through my sons room, they found something. It was a drawing Sam had made, and on it was the most horrid thing. It was a picture of his new friends. Two boys were drawn with names above them reading "Keith" and "Mark." But to the far right was a full grown man wearing a hoodie 
with a name above him reading "Jon."

Right then I knew that face, the face my son had moments before being murdered. It was the face of betrayal. I'll never forget it. All I wish now is that I listened to my child more than I did. Maybe this wouldn't have happened, maybe I could have prevented this. If I asked him more about what went on at school, always listened to the end of his stories, found out about Jon earlier, maybe I could have saved him. But It happened, and I wasn't able to prevent it. I never asked those questions and I never listened to the end of his stories. I never found out about Jon until it was too late. 

My little buddy was seven. Seven. That is not a full life that has been lived. I think of him everyday and remember him as the beautiful child I loved and raised. So, from one parent to the other, listen to your children.

Have fun getting a little more creeped out today. 




 This subreddit has been up for awhile now. You see the thing is that right after I made this I found out about the subreddit uplifting news. Now I'm sitting here feeling dumb for making this. You see that rules bar to your right? Ya, about that, no rules. Bye rules, I loved you. You can show your humanity by doing what ever the fuck you damn well please here or anywhere else on Reddit and face the consequences. The thing about here is there are no real consequences I guess. Just don't go way mother fucking over board. God, It's like when I was in grade 11 science and tech class and everyone in that class drove my teacher insane... Literally. So, fuck around all you like on here. Enjoy! 




 That twist...  




 In all seriousness, I really do hope there is such a place like heaven that exists for those poor children. I agree good sir, may they rest in peace. ;_[
