 "what character would you like to-"

Bayonetta. The answer is always Bayonetta.  




 The entire Kill Bill volume 1 soundtrack. Especially *Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood*.  




 Man, Godzilla wasn't even *trying* and he didn't kill as many people. King of the Monsters 10/10.  




 ...fair enough. 




 I have the three-in-ones and the standalone 13 and 14. I hope there may one day be an "End of Evangelion" arc-based compilation with 12, 13, 14. It's probable, however, that that isn't going to happen. If you want to hold out for something like that, more power to you.  




 That was like a ahittier version of Lucy.

 Yeah, he has a sword.  




 The question was about Second Impact, which was merely the result of a contact experiment between a human and Adam. Every single Impact was a result of the combination of Lilith and Adam. First Impact was when Lilith landed on Earth, terraforming it for Lilin and requiring Adam to be impaled on his Lance. 2I was the contact experiment- no Lilith soul involved. 3I was souls and bodies, in as well as the combination of Unit-01 and Zeruel's S2 engine, AND the combination of Ascended Unit-01 and the Adam-based MP-Evas. That's why 3I was able to start instrumentality.  




 Well, as we saw in EoE, she is. Her involvement in 3I started when Shinji started screaming, not when she was crucified by the rest of the Eva series.  




 Homura did nothing wrong 




 From what I can tell, the only ingredients for an Impact is the combination of Lilith and Adam, not their souls specifically. During Second Impact, the combination was the body of Adam with the flesh of the Lilith-based humans. Lilith herself still had her soul, back under the city eventually known as Tokyo-3.  




 Liam Neeson was on Sesame Street? When was this? 




 How about Varan or Frankenstein conquers the world?

 Atragon? War of the Gargantuas? Rebirth of Mothra? 




 I'm pretty sure, considering the fact that Nukem is an amalgam of 80's action movie characters, that the similarities aren't coincidental.

 "I don't like what you're saying so lalalalala I can't hear you!" 




 Yippie-Ki-Yayy lmao.  




 Despite forcing the children to sign a contract, keep in mind that the contract was signed by minors, and therefore null and void. His factory is also several square miles, violating his property and moving into the private property of the surrounding city. He can't have let any health inspectors into his factory, and I refuse to believe his been paying taxes. He's housing potentially thousands of illegal immigrants. The glass elevator is *incredibly* dangerous, which could be considered a weapon.  




 Simon the Digger vs Shinji Ikari, I guess. I want to say Unit-01 could actually win, simply because I like NGE more than Gurren Lagann, but if Simon had transformations beyond Arc-Gurren Lagann then Eva gets rekt. If not, then it ends up being a classic battle of unmovable object vs unstoppable force. Bizzaro-Lagann could take it, since as he gets more and more scared of losing, he's going to get stronger and stronger, which will eventually result in him being stronger than Simon with all the Spiral Power in the universe. The question is if Simon kills Shinjimon before he can accumulate the power required to kill GL with pure bitchliness. I give it to simon 6/10, but if it were anyone other than Simon i would actually give it to Bizarro GL.  




 Say that to my face fucker not online see what happens.  




 You clever son of a bitch.  




 Most of my favorite fictional women I actually like for their character, not out of lust. I could stand Mothra trying to seduce me or 24 hours (though that would be funny as hell). Bayonetta would be harder, but since she's built like Slenderman with some well-placed fruit in his outfit, I think I could last if a million dollars were on the line. One day simply isn't enough to be worth a million. Now if I got to spend the rest of my life with her in exchange for a million dollars, that would be different.  




 Fun fact: Giratina's cry in this movie is actually the cry of Mothra. Since Toho is the distributor (I think) for the Pokemon movies, this happens several times throughout the series, though Giratina's is the only one I can think of.  




 For both Project M/Melee Roy and Roy the Koopa Kid, "Coy Boy Named Roy" 




 I think I posted about this a while back. But as the Commander said, the Lord only reveals a weakened form to us mortals so we can understand it. If He didn't, the end result would be something straight out of Lovecraft. Literally, because that's what he wrote about.

 Are we really counting "the" as a word? Because last time I checked, "the" isn't technically a full-fledged word.  




 It puts Sam Elliott's mustache to shame.  




 Does this mean that Mankanshoku Mothra's "Hallelujah" speeched are replaced with Mothra Song speeches? 




 Both the MUTOs and Rodan (the first ones) just wanted some of that radioactive kaiju ass.  




 It looks like something out of Yugioh.  




 I really wanna get my hands on those for my room. They look so fuckin cool.  




 To be a bit more specific, I need an app that lets me watch my subscriptions, preferably in the highest quality possible, without much else. I don't want to official app because last time I used it it was completely jank and judging from what I've heard it still is. Are there any iPhone apps I can use as a replacement? Or should I just use he website? 




 **DUH** 




 Looks like Arceus wanted to reward you for something.  




 Fits with the picture pretty well, actually.  




 If they were my sponsor, I'd wear it to a tournament.  




 Has inbreeding gone too far? 




 I'd watch 26 episodes of this.  




 That looks awesome!  




 /r/retiredgif 




 Apparently there's an Evangelion 3DS theme in Japan only. That combined with the lack of regular N3DS leads me to the conclusion that Nintendo hates me in particular.  




 Which Sinnoh Myths would be a Honedge? I don't remember any talking about anything other than the Creation Trio.  




 i kinda find it weird that Unit-02 has Divine Unit-01 inside her. I understand why it is, I just think it would've worked better with one of the Angels, like Sahaquiel or Zeruel 2.0.  




 Try God's Not Dead. It's the same bullshit insanity from the other side of the horseshoe. And the only movie to physically assault me as I watched it.  




 So that's why he had to get his head removed.  




 I have the omnibus version. It's much cheaper, and when you have all four together they look pretty nice. 

EDIT: There are a few cons, come to think of it. Volumes 13 and 14 are still only available in the seperate volumes, giving you four monoliths of Eva mangas and two tiny little books at the end. hopefully they'll do an Omnibus release to have those two included as well, preferably alongside Volume 12 so it can be a full End of Evangelion package.  




 I really like the redesign of the returning Angels, mainly Rami-chan and Unit 03. But I kinda hate just about everything else. Especially Mari.  




 Gohan's first born (Pan) has long hair too. Can we expect his next kid to like like the father or like Goku, keeping with the tradition? 




 Yeah the guy at the end of Sinnoh (I think) had a Latios and a Darkrai. And that's why Ash ended up losing the Sinnoh league.  




 They're just peanut butter and jealous.  




 Spiderbro finally gets some.  




 Kill Bill was meant to be one movie, they made it two movies simply because the studio said it was too damn long. So it was meant to be one sitting when it was originally cut. There's actually a full edition called "The Whole Bloody Affair" coming out at some point. Hopefully.  




 Next you'll be telling me you didn't know someone made a rock musical based on Evil Dead.  




 Where can I buy one of these? I've wanted one for *so goddamn long*.  




 That and Return to the Forbidden Planet, the jukebox musical sequel by the guy who did Rocky Horror.  




 Yeah, this is absolutely parody.  




 Foundation books

Odd way to spell Forbidden Planet 




 People don't like Ghostbusters 2? I thought it was at least as good as the original (even if it did follow the Evil Dead approach to a second movie) 




 Army of Darkness. Apparently critics really hate this movie, but it's actually one of my favorite of all time.  




 This doesn't belong here, this is a dank meme.  




 Did he promise the son $1000 though? 




 Rotom. There's no situation I've ever come across that I wouldn't want the help of a Rotom in. I would never have to spend money on gas, my lawn would mow itself, my oven would never burn anything, my devices would always hold a charge, it's the most useful Pokemon in day-to-day life.  




 Considering AoT is basically a mecha (according to Evangelion they can be giant monsters instead of robots), that would totally work.

 Independence Day Braviary

NA-exclusive Wifi event, only on July 4th of every year. 

Moves: Superpower, Brave Bird, Helping Hand (the arsenal of democracy), Payday (because you know, capitalism)

The OT will be a different president every year, but the first year will be Uncle Sam.  




 Honestly, I don't mind one way or the other. Either way, we're getting a good movie. If it's Godzilla, we're getting a Gamera 2/3-level movie, and that's worth delaying 3.0+1.0 for imo.  




 "Goji"'s jaw reminds me of Eva Unit-01 




 I was using a laptop and it just never occurred to me to buy one.  




 I hadn't exactly realized how much better mouse controls are.  




 I had to play TF2 on a trackpad for years until I got a mouse. The first games I played with a mouse, I was an unstoppable God of war. 

So it's kinda like wearing weighted armor in training.  




 Him jacking off to her unconscious body probably didn't help his situation.

 I heard he actually knew [Owen Parson's grandfather.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Zp3BXwDB8) 




 I want to say Mewtwo, because he should be more powerful than Danny, but Psychic is weak to Ghost, so Mewtwo is going to take less hits to kill than usual. Danny 7/10.  




 Best: G'54. Duh. Followed by Vs Mothra and '14

Worst: All Monsters Attack is the only film to date that was so hard to watch I literally couldn't make it past the 18 minute mark.  




 Godzilla vs Megalon as well, also Sub and Dub, also free.  









 A competition among those enlightened by Arceus. Would anyone be interested? For games I was thinking along the lines of Mario Kart, Smash, and (obviously) Pokemon.  




 My favorite Pokemon is Braviary. 

Braviary isn't the most *supernaturally* powerful of all the Pokemon, but its strength will fit right in in the Capital Wasteland. Not to mention the fact that its pure patriotism is rivaled only by... Liberty Prime, actually. The Enclave wouldn't beef with someone patriotic enough to pal around with a red, white, and blue eagle, especially when that eagle can wreck an entire platoon of power armored soldiers with one Return. If we take the place of any random NPC, we'll be fine. We probably have enough strength to take a settlement like the supermarket, then defend it while still being on the good side of one of the major factions. If we take the place of the Lone Wanderer, then things get a little tougher since I can't have Dogmeat. Plus, being hunted down by anyone might end up with them sniping my bird. 

NPC: We live long, healthy lives

PC: We don't make it to the end.  









 I think it was Should You Watch Gunbuster? 




 Anno is depressed?

I feel like a dick being happy about this, but that would mean 3.0+1.0 might be on the same tier as the original.  




 Which is why Rami-Chan is obviously the best girl.

 Caution is on a healthy diet of your mother's cooking, which he eats when she tells him to and only when she tells him to. So Caution will never get fatter than it already is, it just won't be very muscular when it needs to be.

 The Pokemon Anime? 




 The obvious answer is literally everything from Kill la Kill.  




 The tongue is most certainly in the cheek for most members. The problem is the members who check to make sure the tongue is not in the cheek, and end up checking the cheek the tongue is *not* in, causing them to believe that no tongues are in any cheeks.  




 ~~I think it's Good, or Don't Be, from the show itself. It's either that or The Heady Feeling of Freedom, both are instrumental mixes of the OP and both are used in episode 26. Back to back, actually.~~

~~Good or Don't Be is the one used during the "congratulations" scene so I'm like 99% sure it is.~~

Yep, just checked. The one around the 3:00 mark isn't Good or Don't Be, it's just the instrumental. Though I'm pretty sure it is used in the video.  




 The only good thing to come out of this piece of shit movie.  




 As long as it has Unit-01 being a good mommy, I'm interested.

 I once had a game where I was fighting a Mario. He started hitting me with hit jab combo and the moment he did, the game slowed to ~10fps. I said fuck it and committed suicide to get out of such a laggy game. The *moment* I got past the point where I couldn't recover, the game shot back to 60. It happened again the exact same way on the next stock.  









 It seems like it would have been burned off and/or removed when they put the suit on him.

 Decent joke, bad execution.

 This is the weirdest promotional crossover ever. I love it.  




 Falco's shine should reflect the can, and then either side+b or jumping over it should get you over the cartel. Your blaster should also be able to take out the cartel if you hit them.  




 The clones in Smash 4 are just ascended alt skins. The team decided that Doc and Mario, Lucina and Marth, and Dark Pit and Real Pit should be slightly separate, so very little time went into them. It's not like they stole anyone else's spot in the game.  




 Lucas isn't so much a clone as he is a "cousin" to Ness, considering his entire moveset is different, like Falco. Also, those "like 10 clones" didn't take anyone else's spots. They were originally just skins but the Devs decided they should be a bit more unique.  




 but he *is* always relevant, so he's got that going for him.  




 I want to say with 100% certainty that it is, but honestly this is the internet. I've seen a lot worse.  




 The year is 1942. Worrying that they were overpowered by the Axis, the Allies import a team of biological weapons from their newest member- Unova. Six fully trained Braviaries, which the Allies use as a replacement for their armies. Can they restore freedom and Democracy to the world?  




 The entire cast screams and calls 911!

 Assuming it appears at the front door, I can go into a room without windows, barricade the door, and catch up on anime until the battery runs out. 




 The social network that Cass posts her selfie to is called Friendship. Does that count? 




 Contrary to popular belief, Gojira may well be the worst film to start out on. It's gritty, it's dark, and it's almost completely different from every other film in the franchise. The best one to start out on is probably new, American Godzilla. It doesn't have the problem of the special effects that most people find hard to overlook until they're already fans of the series. After that, I would say Godzilla vs Mothra (1964) as that is probably the best monster mash in the franchise.  




 Gurren Lagann: I came for the boobs, I stayed for the drill that's gonna pierce the heavens! 




 i came for the *plot*, then *came* for the *plot* 




 I know it's cliche, but Sword Art Online. It had *so much* potential in its initial premise, but the characters are so boring and the plot so poorly written that I couldn't even make it to the end of the first half that everyone says is good.  




 Sun shines, birds fly, grass grows, and brother, I hurt people. I'm a force of the Patriarchy.  




 The "gay/teams panic" defense. It's the defense that you killed a gay/teams person because you saw them and just went berserk due to a mental disorder. It's only been outlawed in California because no one else is enough of a dumbass to think it would work. Because it never has worked, because you'd have to be a complete dumbass to think it would.  




 In other news, the bear shitting in the woods index is up.  




 [apparently](http://www.kdramastars.com/articles/60639/20141212/kill-la-kill-season-2-confirmed.htm) 




 Season one is *sort of* in two parts. You could say that post-Episode 8 Kill la Kill is pretty different from the first 7, since they form a more linked and emotional plot. You could also say that when the second OP shows up (after the "recap episode") is sort of a second part.  




 Gurren Lagann. I need more of that shit, there's more that can probably be done with it. Maybe the chronicles of Lordgenome in the original battle against the Antispiral? I don't know, but whatever it could be would probably ruin the ending of the original.  




 Season two isn't out yet, it's only been announced.
