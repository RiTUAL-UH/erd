 I'll do that, thanks.  I've heard that John has a reputation for not playing well with others.  Wish him luck in South Cacalaca!
 









 The Oasis has a spectacular view way above Lake Travis with multi-level patio dining tucked into the hillside.  Usually I'd be wary of any Q place with La as part of its name lol but I'll check it out.  




 When I think of Britain and beans somehow this comes to mind...
https://youtu.be/ChGxwRq3YcI
 




 OP, before we go and pay that much for a can of beans in tomato sauce please let us know if they are any different that what we get here.    




 The Greistmill in Gruene and The Oasis in Austin have great food and the most beautiful outdoor dining views!  Franklin's is great for BBQ but THE WAIT! 




 I expected at least some spinach. As a sailor, I nonetheless approve! 




 Oh yes!  Very nice! 




 See comment above.  As far the best here?  That's hard to pin down.  90% of the 4,000 or so members of the Texas Restaurant Association serve CFS.  In Fort Worth I like Lucille's,  Babe's Chicken House or Vickery Cafe.   




 It's no big secret how to make your own.  Take cubed steak and pound the shit out of it till it looks like it wrestled with a waffle iron and lost.  

Season 2 cups of flour with the seasoning of your choice.  I like "Slap Yo Momma".  In a second container mix 1 1/2 cups buttermilk, 2 Tsp baking powder, 1 Tsp baking soda and 1 egg, garlic and hot sauce.  Coat in flour,  then dredge in the buttermilk mixture and place back into the flour.
  
Very Important...when you coat it the second time make sure you thoroughly pat the flour into the steak until it feels dry.  Place your steaks on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and dusted with flour.  Refrigerate up to an hour until you're ready to fry em up.  This step is not necessary but I feel it makes a crispier crust and gives you time to clean.  Fry at 325F in 1/2 inch oil about for 6 to 8 minutes on each side.

Use 2 Tbsp of the leftover oil and pan drippings to make a cream gravy.  

You've done it all right if you don't need a knife to cut it or teeth to chew it for that matter!      




 LOL, ya got me there! 




 Funny because it was made by a Texan at my house in Texas?
 




 IDC Burgers.  Shell station in Aledo, TX outside of Fort Worth. 




 IDC Burgers @ a Shell station in Aledo, TX 









 I would love that!  Over a plate of CFS of course.  




 Thank you.  It's unfortunate that what the order did and does is true.  I would truly hope that the Catholic Church cared about the most vulnerable of the people in your country but they unwaveringly care only about money and power.  Nameste. 




 LOL! Burleson as in Brig. Gen. Edward Burleson, who led a regiment at San Jacinto, was the Vice President under the Republic of Texas and my forth great grand-father.  

No matter,  I'm in far SW Fort Worth.  Drop me a line and I'll tell you all my secrets.    




 True, every once in awhile! 




 In Texas.  At my house.   If I like you! 









 Did something similar with a cheesecake.

 Yes,  It's an emulsified butter sauce and Escoffier named it as a mother sauce,  at 5 parts butter to egg yolk hollandaise sauce should be called heart attack sauce.  









 Lower your heat, season your flour, use a deeper pan with oil at least 1/2 in. deep.  Try, try again and good luck! 




 She had a fetish for dying people; sort of a belief that pain and suffering were gifts from God.  Almost none of the millions of dollars she received went to help the dying people her and her order professed to help.  Her order would reuse old needles and withhold basic pain relief.  Also she associated with some questionable people.  Not only did they not treat or comfort the "dying" in her care but many people died who would have lived if they received basic care.  Of course, when she became ill she received the best care available. 




 Mother Teresa 




 Actually it's being very honest.  If I described guacamole then I'd be dishonest.  Your feedback is nonetheless ignored as being irrelevant.  




 These are delicious and so easy to make.  Just rub wings with a packet of taco seasoning and bake and then toss them in your favorite taco sauce! 









 Nice job!  I see The Shed is bottling their sauce.  Great little place.  Glad they rebuilt after burning down.  




 Absolutely!  First thing I noticed. 




 Your chef is wrong.  That's the last thing you should do! 




 True.  I wear my calluses and certain scars with pride.  If you apply for a position the first thing I'll check is you hands!   




 When I was 8 my mother said it looked like brains from a car wreck served on a plate.  Didn't phase me a bit. She didn't like pizza either. 




 Hope that list doesn't include a hot dog cause...

 Ketchup over eggs has been debated in my family for ever.   









 To add to that chicken fried steak is sometimes served at breakfast along with eggs and potatoes. 




 Of course!  because what you call chips are fries and what you call crisps are chips lol! 




 Corn and tomatoes.  You're welcome. 




 I saw a guy do the same thing.  He was a drilling reservist and came in all hungover.  While making eggs on the flat-top he just placed his hand palm down on it to steady himself. He did even realize it until a cook knocked his hand off!    




 I was boiling pasta in a tilting 80 gallon steam jacket kettle during a busy drill weekend.  While I was holding a large colander another cook tilted the kettle forward to drain.  He cranked that sucker too fast and boiling water poured all over my left hand.  I put a latex glove on my hand, filled it with ice water and tied it off with a rubber band and kept cooking only stopping occasionally to drain and refill when the water warmed up.  My skin stayed red for a couple of days but never blistered.   




 Or, conversely, you make real hollandaise and they say it doesn't taste right because the only hollandaise they've had came from a packet.  




 There was/is a popular restaurant in New Orleans that served THE BEST burgers until they were shut down and it wasn't because of Katrina.  They filled a 2' pickle barrel with frozen beef patties and set it on the floor next to the grill uncovered, taking them out as the orders came in.  They'd refill it at night without cleaning it out and store it in the refer till the next day.  No telling how long this went on but FIFO definitely wasn't a term they ever heard because when they were shut down the bottom of the pickle barrel was alive with maggots.       




 Well this Navy cook never saw anything like this: shore or ship.  For slow mornings we'd crack maybe 4 lugs of eggs (120) but for drill weekends or at sea we used 15 lbs tubs of pasteurized frozen eggs.    




 That sounds like my grandmother-in-law.  She wasn't exactly a hoarder as she kept her house clean but she would wash and reuse the Styrofoam trays that was used for meat from the grocery store.   




 In the Navy we were supposed to thaw meat in a refrigerator but that was almost always impossible so we followed the "emergency shipboard thawing procedures".  This meant you could place cases of various meats in their original packaging, place on sheet pans and leave out at room temperature for a determinate time.         




 All fats will go rancid even vegetable oils given enough time.  However, my great aunt would keep leftover bacon/sausage grease in a coffee can (covered of course) on the kitchen counter and would use it to saute and flavor vegetables etc.  




 A caddilac is a term used for a "fancy" mop bucket that has an attachment where the mop can be wrung out. 




 It's funny that cracked pepper was not listed in the description for this dish. 




 No, do not let the root ball dry out.  Water a ficus or Fiddle Leaf regularly but don't let it sit in its waste water.  If the root ball has completely dried out and the plant is small enough, submerge it in plain water until saturated then let drain completely   




 Your Dracaena Marginata is not happy! Marginata's need water but not a lot and do not let them dry out.   Good news!  It's perfectly normal for a DM to loose its lower leaves as it grows.  If it's a matter of too little watering you will see brown dead leaves scattered all over.  The brown tips you see are usually caused by salt damage.  This can happen a number of ways but it can be prevented by watering the DM enough so that water drains out  the bottom and flushes the salts out.  If you let this plant sit in its own water runoff especially its own "waste" then it will uptake the salt and will burn the ends.  Letting it sit in water for any length of time will also lead to stem and fungal rot.   Make sure all the soil is saturated when water when you do water.  Sometimes a rootball will dry up to the point that water doesn't penetrate and just leaks around it so use your best judgement.  Marginatas need water and don't like to ever dry out but they also cannot stand to be left in standing water.   So it looks like this guy need to be repotted because I'm seeing some roots and the pot is too small for the plant.  Choose a pot that is no more than 2 inches bigger than the original and had drainage.  Don't fertilize.  After transplanting use a weak solution of root starter.  Again, don't freak out if it loses for leaves.  At this point you want to grow roots, not leaves.  BTW,  just cut off the ends of the leaves at an angle.  Good luck! 




 In a pinch for just a few portions it's not that bad but if you fry a lot it can add to much fat to the fryer and all that salt will cause the oil to go bad quickly.  




 My friend worked at a popular cheesesteak place outside of Philly that delivered to the local military base.  Was told to make tuna salad in the caddilac because nothing else was available.  Quit and walked out. 




 Classic.  Did you go ahead and make it from scratch? 




 From what I've heard from industry people, your delicious breadsticks are recycled from each and every table that didn't eat all the bread.  Yum, especially if they happened to sneeze all over them!  




 Considering salmonella is/may be present on the outside of the egg shell I find this disgusting and as an 18 year veteran I've never heard of this.  Most military and government installations including ships buy 20 lbs tubs of pasteurized eggs for scrambled and omelets.

Please stop this!      




 A clarification.  I mean more a process like heating up veggies in the water on a steam table or mixing tuna salad in a mop bucket.  




 While on shore duty I had a cook add pancake syrup to cooked carrots instead of following the recipe... butter, ginger and honey.  He said that's what they did on the ship.  That didn't sail on my watch!   




 That's a square meal!
 




 What do you do with your steaks?  




 My godfather designed the Mexican Hat ride.  That fact never got me any free tickets! 




 Jim Bowie and his brother John were slave smugglers/traders/owners. 




 The Cherokee, with whom he lived with for a short while, called him "The Big Drunk". 




 Yes! 




 Sounds like you're doing somethings right;  simmering water that slowly releases bubbles if at all, more like a bloop, bloop (not boiling, added vinegar, cooking 3 1/2 to 4 minutes.  Are you using a very deep pot?  12 inches or more?  Break each egg into individual cups and add one at a time as close to the waterline as possible while gently stirring in a circler motion around the egg.  Keep swirling around slowly.  JS! 




 And this has anything to do with poached eggs? 




 Good on you! 




 Get a dish job at a place that's busy but notorious for cooks not showing up and you'll rise to stardom. 




 Although I understand your frustration it's wrong for you to label your fry guy as incompetent if he's actually a dishwasher.  The one who is incompetent is your manager.  Take it up with him if you have a pair.  
Manning a fryer may seem easy to you but depending on the product it can be daunting.  At least he's trying and you should recognize that and possibly help or encourage him instead of calling him a moron.  

Think about that on your next smoke break! 




 LOL, I'd write out this and similar sentiments when I'd season the grill when I was a cook in the Navy!  Had to waste about 2 dozen eggs anyway.  I'd also write EAT ME or worse on the sheet cakes as a baker.  No harm and no knew but me and the FSA's. 




 "Royal" Engineers LOL!  Perhaps your "royal" rats in the UK are so full of crap that it makes sense not to eat them.  Considering your sewage system I would agree that you shouldn't eat UK gutter rats and mice. 




 You're from PA? 




 Smother those eggs in ketsup till it looks like a train wreck! Yum! 




 Your friends are right but you aren't.  You weren't even ever in a any military position.  So Piss Off Pussy!  




 Rats and mice are most certainly considered food sources. You're so full of shit! You obviously aren't military much less gone through survival training.  Step off!  




 Thank you OP!  I have diverticulosis which means I can't have seeds, corn or nuts and the one thing I miss is a Snicker's bar.  It was my favorite and now I can make my own nutless version. 




 Nothing is straightforward when it comes to the predictability of the menstrual cycle.  You can ovulate while on your period and get pregnant.  Your teacher is obviously ignorant and misinformed and should not be teaching sexual education to minors! 




 During a sex ed class in Navy Bootcamp a recruit asked if he could get AIDS from breastmilk. This was in 1993 BTW.  He also stated that it would be impossible for him to stop having sex once he started even if she told him to stop and that it would not be considered rape. 




 I would not say that you're more likely to get pregnant during your period but it IS possible.  The second statement may depend on what type of birth control you use.  The bottom line is that menstruation does not make it impossible to conceive and it certainly doesn't prevent you from getting an STD.     









 Cream of 'insert here' soup was a Capitalistic plot by Campbell's Soup Company to promote their product plus really bad recipe books following WWII which, because of convenience for the average housewife, led to a decrease in cooking skills.  

 This lead to the eventual low standards of the American palate that grew up to believe that condensed tomato soup from a can was normal and Hmm, Hmm good!  

 Eventually no one knew how to make a sauce, roux or soup  without Campbell's condensed soup.  Except for people in New Orleans and surrounding areas.

 They seemed to have been influenced by Communists to resist the Capitalists influence of convenience foods and instead what they had growing in their backyard or local market.  This is well documented by the Warren Report that outlined the Communist presence and their influence on Lee Harvey Oswald but I digress.

 An entire generation was born and raised not knowing how to cook and their only crutch continued to be Campbell's soup and even crappier cookbooks in the 60's complete with jello molds (but that's another story).  Things would change in the 70's though!

 As early as 1931 the first edition of "The Joy of Cooking" was published but was mostly ignored by home cooks.  After it's 6th edition in 1975 its popularity suddenly exploded and sales sky-rocketed.  This seemed to beat all logic but a book published a little earlier explains why.

  In 1972, A book titled "The Joy of Sex" was published that proved enormously popular even though it had illustrations of hairy hippies.  I have to say at this point that that those illustrations were my first visualizations of sex.  I really couldn't actually describe what I thought sex was at that age but the JOS made it perfectly plain and more important that it sex was not scary, but I digress again.  Sorry.

  It's my theory that the "Joy of Cooking" became popular after the "Joy of Sex" was published because if the JOS worked for you then the FOC would too.  Makes perfect sense.  Sex then food!

Please don't get me started about how Spam ruined Hawaiian cuisine!   




 How witty.  Not to good at taking some criticism are ya? 




 Exactly.  Still makes a brick.  Maybe something like this.

 Diet coke,  Dr Pepper and Ginger Ale=Texas 




 Hotdish, a type of casserole usually brought to a church potluck or family reunion.  Not to be confused with Funeral Potatoes which are starch based and brought to the deceased's home.    




 That's not a ham hock.  Hocks come from the ankles of a pig.  That looks like what was left over from a bone-in spiral ham.  I'm sure it tasted good regardless.  

I myself like to add pickled pork for the texture difference along with andouille plus a touch of thyme.  Unfortunately I can't find picked pork here in Texas.  

"Laissez les bons temps rouler!" 




 Stacking ham slices that thick is disgusting aesthetically and to the palette.   Might as well bite into a brick of ham.  This could be made so much better using very thin or shaved ham and folded rather than stacked.   
 




 I may have some buyers for your sausage here in Fort Worth.  If you're interested contact me at tulips_1795@yahoo.com.  




 JoJo fries are the best!   




 That grinder is awesome!  You must do this often.  Live anywhere in or near Texas?
 




 The photo is out of focus, 




 Don't waste your money on this gimmick.  The knockoff recipe using Bisquick is as good if not better and cheaper. 




 They were for the mash later on.  My Mom always made a relish tray to nibble on while the rest of the dinner was being prepared. 




 Yes, yes you can! 




 This reminds me of my bowels in a good day! 




 Make some TexMex wontons.  Even better, use it in enchiladas along with mild cheddar or use it in chicken quesidillas. 
 









 There's no n00b on the inside. 




 Well I don't know about Sydney but here in the US the homeless usually eat either discarded food in dumpsters or nothing at all unless they suffer the indignities of "homeless shelters" that by their very rules prevent anyone who's homeless from getting and keeping a job.
 




 What's your point in posting this?  I've had worse serving in the military.  What's your angle? 




 I guess you've never encountered Lady Parts! 




 If you're a gal then that's kinda sad.  If you're a guy, I'm so sorry for you. LOL!
 




 I'd eat it! 














 Don't hold your breath waiting for a coherent answer from a Christian LOL!
 




 You conveniently forgot to explain the rest of the compound word.  "Potent" or powerful.  Omnivore has a much different meaning than omnipotent or even omniscient.  

Your comparison is false.  The paradox still stands. 




 I wish our politics were somehow based on cuisine because, I mean, I love you man!
