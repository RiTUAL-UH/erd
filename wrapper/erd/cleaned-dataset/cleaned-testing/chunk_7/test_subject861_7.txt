 Very cringeworthy and I'm a Christian. I hope that I sense his heart behind his words saying...never mind. I tried to see some validity in this but just couldn't. I don't know the solution to all that is going on over there with ISIS, but I do know there is a better solution than convert or kill. 




 Labor Day tomorrow!

* Plan to take it easy and game a good portion of the day.
* Gym + Cardio
* Read at least two chapters of *The Giver*.
* Write *at least* one word in my book.
* Devotions and prayer.
* Eat healthy. 




 Step two: THE 




 You just made my day. BunnyProof.com. That is hilarious.

I am looking at Logitech speakers as I've been really impressed with them in the past. Is there one you would suggest? One that might be comparable to the Z-4 of the past? 




 ...and I'm heartbroken. I've had this speaker system for years and it was *INCREDIBLE* for the money I spent on it. 

I need some suggestions for a new speaker system that is just as good quality (preferably with a subwoofer) for a reasonable price. Looking to spend under $100. 




 My wife and I own the domain www.theyseemerollintheyhatin.com 




 Love this. Can you do more like this?  




 I feel like you live in this subreddit just to say stupid things. 




 This sounds logical. Do you have a source confirming Ubisoft Sofia's control of the project? 




 Do you really think they will not release it for PC? What would be the reasoning behind this?  




 I've only been working for Abstergo Industries for three and a half months, but I'll try my best to answer your question according to what seems to be the "norm"  around here (if there is such a thing).  

Just like any healthy business, there are a number of employment levels. We have administrative assistant and interns that are still in college working on various bachelor's degrees. Most deskers, as we like to call them, have a master's degree or some equivalent. Our typical technical professionals all have undergrad degrees with a few years of experience in other organizations. 

Higher ups, those well above my pay grade, vary in scholastic pedigree. A few have doctorates, but most are just well connected through relationships or blood. I can't really tell what it is that gives them the clearance to know the stuff they know. They seem to have a lot of secrets the higher up the ladder they go. Screens are turned off, folders closed, and conversations paused often when I enter rooms. I'm not sure how to take it. 

Anyways, hope that helps out. Would love to see you apply. Abstergo is a great employer! Feel free to PM me your info and I'll see if I can pass your name on to my boss. Later.

 It'd probably be cool to equip him with an earpiece, you know, just in case he gets lost from the group and we still need to communicate with him. 

*curls up into a ball+single tear* 




 inb4 [Man at Arms](http://youtu.be/xogheZdAO18) built a replica.  




 Very nice work. Love the lines.  




 Please excuse me, ma'am. 




 The guy losing his mind is in no sense of the word a "success". He is so full of malevolence it is past scary; it's just sad. Really sad. 




 You are really really good. I want to meet you. Hi. 




 Love this. You have talent, sir. 




 [This](http://i.imgur.com/KIdrSLO.jpg?1) is the only picture of me in the world. 




 "Do you know a Grace? A Gabby? Gabriella, maybe? Gloria? Gina? Girl. Girl. Do you know a girl? Any girl maybe? Do you know of any girl?" 




  Honestly, there's no way I'm this retarded, but as I'm sitting here writing this I feel about 60% sure that I wrapped them in tinfoil. I really can't remember though.

I enjoyed being able to read his own cringe as he wrote down what he remembered to be true. That's some Inception level stuff right there. 




 I haven't purchased any sandals yet because the new craze is Roman/gladiator sandals and I can't bring myself to do it.

I like how simple your are. 




 What are your sandals? 




 Well stated. 

I would like to see an ancient Egyptian assassin that uses ancient assassination techniques. I'm talking the use of snakes, scorpions, rope (strangulation), poisoned feathers, and the like.  




 There's a book covering his time as an Assassin. 




 People are going to disagree with me, but here we go:

1. **Altar** - Although he broke the creed early on, his whole story is one of redeeming himself and rebuilding his confidence of the creed.

1. **Edward** - This is where most will think I'm crazy. "But, test_subject861, Edward wasn't even an Assassin!1!!1! lolz". Listen, I know. But if anyone believe that nothing is true and everything is permitted, it was a pirate who had little standards and/or boundaries. Additionally, Edward was oft hidden and once joining, never compromised the Brotherhood.

1. **Ezio** - It took a while for our friend to grow into the brotherhood and understand what it means to be an Assassin. He committed his first murders out in the open for all to see. There was even a mission where he was wrong and took the life of an innocent. But, he learned from it and became better.

1. **Connor** - Connor was never hidden (tenet #2). He was always out in the open. Plus, I'm not entirely sure that Connor even knew or was taught the creed. To my knowledge, he never spoke it as the other Assassins did. 




 I'm pretty sure that is a polo, friend.  




 Waxahachie for college. Midlothian for family.   




 These guys are self-aware. They know what they're doing. Does no one else see that?  




 Exactly. And I'd probably still get it wrong. 




 Ew. Bad host. Anyone can get their mind tied up in knots on live television, on a game show, with a timer. Give the contestant a break, man! 




 It could have been cringe-worthy but Wahlberg decided he would be kind, down to earth, and give the security guard a "good" interview.

Great on you Mr. Wahlberg. Great on you. 




 It's a good video though, am I right?

Click above to see their shoes. I'd like to get some for casual wear. 




 This is pretty good advice. I would suggest one more thing:

**Send me the shoes you get rid of. I will continue to take care of them in your stead and send you bi-annual pictures so you can see how your precious babies are being treated.** 









 I would love to see a video walkthrough of this. Is it out there? Someone find me a link, I'm lazy. 




 You are right. Completely right. Forgive me for the overstatement.  




 This is going to be completely buried.

Randomly found your site yesterday as I was looking for good gaming podcasts. My wife and I watched your most recent podcast all the way through and I just wanted to stop by and tell you that it is hands down the best gaming podcast we have heard. Very informative, differing opinions, on topic. Love it all.

Also, love that you are in/from Austin. It's a great city to live in! 




 True on that. I'm just kinda fed up with all the talk I'm hearing about it all. It has blown up into a game that has no females in it whatsoever. It has become a game from a corporation that hates women (not true). Oh yeah, don't forget that Ubisoft is a racist corporation also because every assassin has been white (also not true). They did bring some of it on themselves by their first lousy response. I just think it could have been immediately remedied by a better, more thought out response. 




 I know you're tired of hearing about it. I am too. But, if I were a Ubisoft representative, this is what I would have said when asked about playable female characters in AC: Unity:

 No, Unity will not feature playable females in our new co-op gaming mode. If you desire to play as a female assassin, we have another game that will meet that request. However, in Unity, everyone will be playing as Arno, a male assassin, and will always see their character as such. This is why all co-op characters will be male, because in all actuality, they are Arno with a different face.
 
 This, however, does NOT mean there are no female characters in Unity. In fact, there are MANY female characters in Unity. Furthermore, there are even female assassins in Unity! We love women. We love women as playable characters. There will be many more opportunities in the future of the AC universe to play as females. Unity is not that game. 




 I agree. They sounded great, were really organized, and had obviously put a lot of practice into it. 

BUT...they should have stopped at two or three songs. They went too long (cringe) and then the mall cop (cringe) had to step in. 

Could have all been avoided with brevity.  




 I don't have much to submit outside of the following:  
Creation defies basic logical principles. Miracles defy basic logical principles. Fully God and fully man defies basic logical principles. Resurrection from the dead does as well.

In the Christian faith I wouldn't be too scared from deviating from basic logical principles.
