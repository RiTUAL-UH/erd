 Lol, I love you too. 




 But it doesn't have to be. I respect if you feel like you're fine with the way things are, I just think there's a way to bring your 5 in tune with everyone else's. But that's all I'll say about it. Just know, if you ever need to talk to someone, I'm available.  




 Yeah, it's very different with the different cultures and how they look on mental illness. 




 Ok, I've dealt with a lot of these comments and remained civil about it, but seriously Fuck You. You think I haven't tried other means? I've exercised, done various forms of meditation, tried to force myself out of it. You've faced loss? So have I. You think I can't think of anything good? Mother fucker I've had plays performed across the country, I have more creativity in my left ring finger than you have in your whole body. If you were able to work through your shit together good for you, but how dare you come down on someone who needs more help than that. Shame on you.  




 Thanks, I appreciate that. 




 Not a problem. Keep me updated and let me know if you ever need somebody to talk to. 




 Absolutely, the pharmaceutical industry is out to get to you. Now go back to watching loose change and let the grown ups talk 




 Sleep paralysis. None of the other stuff. 




 Psychiatrist, insurance covers it, he's been practicing for almost twenty years. 




 Try reading the thread first next time, and nothing about the original post was misleading, that was the diagnosis as presented to me from my psychiatrist. 




 It's funny aint it? And I don't feel like i've been woe is me take pitty at all today, I just wanted to talk to some people and maybe my experiences can help them even just a little, which i think/hope I've done. 




 Dude, we had this conversation almost 24 hours ago, check the post. My diagnosis is  Dysthymia with a secondary presentation of a Major Depressive Disorder. This developed from my original diagnosis of Atypically presenting Depression. I consider it one diagnosis, people argued with me, I am agreeing to disagree on this. So no I've lived with this for around 15 years so I understand it quite well thanks. 




 I was on lexapro, now on prozac. 




 It's a persistant state, emotional peaks tend to come with bi polar disorder. I'm in therapy and taking meds to combat at the moment. 




 Really sorry to hear that man, but just remember suicide is not the way to go ever. Keep an open dialogue with people, we want to listen and help you out. 




 They may but as we've established double depression is new but very real. 




 HEY EVERYBODY, NOT EVERYTHING THIS GUY SAYS FITS THE EXACT DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF WHAT I WAS TAUGHT SO HE'S A PHONY. Really dude? I'm trying to share my experiences and I think maybe I've helped some people. Fuck off. 




 Very well putt 




 It's like six degrees of kevin bacon but less sad 




 That's their opinion. It's pointless to argue with people who won't update their understanding to the modern world. I look at people who take that view on mental illness as the Westboro Church of the medical community. They're just silly and can't be argued with so it's best to ignore them.  




 Sometimes all it takes is the one person 




 Thanks, love you too. 




 Yeah, wasnt crazy about it. Thanks for your thoughts! 




 I certainly had never heard of it before my last session. 




 If I understand correctly yes 




 No, because I'm not suicidal and my doctor as well aware of my previous condition. I wasn't diagnosed with a major disorder, I was diagnosed with an atypically presenting disorder. 




 Thanks, and it does. I'm looking into meditation exercises that might work for me. 




 Mildly? 




 Thanks! 




 Oh no no, didn't mean it like that, there a shit ton of comments, was just giving a heads up that i was doing copy pasta for that answer. No worries, sorry if i offended. 




 Repost from earlier. i was originally diagnosed with Atypically presenting depression

 That's what I was initially diagnosed with a year ago. At the time it was atypical because I could sleep and find some joy in day to day life. Less so now. 




 Excellent point, but I will be researching multiple methods to see if anything fits with me. 




 It's a very tauist way of looking at things, I can definitely see how that could help some people. I personally feel that if the problem is chemical than focus alone won't help, but again, the brain is crazy strange and powerful so I can see how it may work for some people. That's one of the reasons I'm exploring meditation. 




 I hope not, I'm hoping to be able to ween off them after a few years, but everyone is different so i dont know. 




 If that's how you choose to view it, then that's you're choice, I just know what my results have been. 




 I spent a third of the thread saying Meds arent for everyone and find what works for you. I'm done with your bullshit troll 




 And we're pulling for you. Glad I could help and let me know if I can do anything else.  




 The thing is I'm slowly learning there's a lot more to live for and it's not just the fear that stops me anymore. You have a lot to live for and people love you, if you ever feel like taking action, talk to someone. 




 The first treatment actually made me a lot better, but I eventually leveled out and stopped getting better before I was fully 'normal'. I had to stop seeing that counselor for money reasons and didnt want to keep taking pills if i wasnt seeing the person who perscribed them regularly so i weened myself off of them. 




 You too, I hope the government sponsored aliens don't invade your headspace to take you back on the zany ride. 




 Any time. Bookmark this convo if you can and let me know how it goes. And if you ever need someone to talk, I'm always happy to listen 




 It's apparently fairly new terminology. 




 The joke you're looking for is surplus, and no, but it goes into remission.
