 well if you can manage to somehow not die instantly you will want to heal cougar jump over an available wall and if you have flash up and they flash towards you get ready to pounce your way to another wall and either flash or pounce. other than that you need to understand how much damage your Q [cougar]is going to do before hand. 




 i might be able to help although i have the same problem with vi always get ahead eventually. however i have played a decent amount of yasuo and can atleast help you with the early phase if your interested just message me back im on the NA servers but i could possibly make a video to help you out if your not on NA 




 my daily ritual is to hop on to the client stare at the screen of solo queue and ask my self "do i really hate myself enough to put myself through this again" as i click the start search and get into champion select and lose another game that could've been won. 




 well during the game when did you use your E perhaps a bug happened that you managed to set up.
