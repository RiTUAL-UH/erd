 Kaichou wa Maid-sama is another one of my favourites!

Haven't seen Golden Time though, might watch it then! :)

These are all great and in my top ten, so I highly recommend them! 




 I absolutely loved Chihayafuru (and the second season)! Japanese culture really interests me and I love anime they showcase different aspects of the culture, like Chihayafuru does with karuta. More than anything though I just love the characters and how much they love karuta and dedicate themselves to it! Makes me wish I played too :3 




 I was the same, although in saying that I don't usually cry when watching anime or movies or whatever. YLIA definitely hit me right in the feels though!
