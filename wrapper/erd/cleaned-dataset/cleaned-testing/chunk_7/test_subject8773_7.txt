 Thank you so much for your reply. I really recommend that you do write her something. And even if you never get the courage to send it, keep it and look at it every now and then until you do :)

And yeah about the whole therapist thing, I told mine before I left for winter break that I wish I could have those really good daughter-mother relationships that a lot of my friends have, and she told me that I didn't have to have one person with all the qualities a good mother would have, it might be enough if I have several people with one or two of those good qualities. That's something that has really helped me be less sad about not having a good relationship with her. 




 Thank you! And yes, she does have a really twisted sense of Christianity like that. I know she's going around twisting the story and what I wrote her, but I know she's also probably panicking on the inside about what I might be telling people.  




 I love this!!
 




 I hated this so much about my Nmom. She would do the same thing, except she would interrupt me while i was *answering a question she asked me.* And then could not see how incredibly rude she was being. 

These things will never cease to amaze me.

 It's pretty short, for those who don't like to read a lot of text all at once.

Anyway, I just sent this message to my mother last night, for some stupid reason. I know it won't make a difference, but it made me feel better that I got some of that out directly to her. It reads:

"Hey, thanks for unfriending me on Facebook. Now i don't have do it myself. Just wanted to say a couple things in case i don't talk to you or see you ever again. I thought you should know your daughter is part of the LGBT community (pansexual to be exact), a multiple-event rape survivor, and a severely depressed and suicidal member of society. So excuse me for having a problem with religion and the way you decide to be a "Christian". And excuse me for wanting to get away from your psychotic, violent episodes.I'm not sure what your problem has always been with me but you sure as hell made it so i couldn't trust you enough to talk to you about what was really going on in my life and why i am so angry. There are so many things i can say about how your actions over the years have really really messed me up. But it'll be lost on you. I hope you feel really guilty about abusing someone emotionally and physically who did nothing to stop you. And I hope you feel really guilty about acting as crazy as grandma and papa. I know you know what you did was wrong, and i know you'll never admit it. I hope you realize that you've ruined any sort of relationship we could have had. Good luck living with that. You burned your side of the bridge and now I'm burning mine. Im incredibly sad about the loss of my siblings, and that they had to witness what they did, on Christmas of all days. I have to protect myself, however, if i even want to live to see them grow up. I hope you feel terrible that your last words to me included "get this evil witch out of my house." I don't know what kind of mother says that to her child about a stupid argument, but it's no mother of mine. Have a good life, [mother's first name]."

I wanted to write this to her so that she could realize HER actions have consequences, and that she's doing the opposite of making things hard for me. She's made my life a whole hell of a lot easier by cutting off contact and kicking me out of the house. I also used her first name because to her, that's one of the most disrespectful things you can do to a parent. Also, she would always complain about how she had a terrible childhood at the hands of my grandma and grandpa, and that what she did to me didn't compare (which, we all know is not a valid excuse to treat me the way she did my whole life), even though it really does compare.

It just felt really good to do. My heart was pounding the whole time. I kept imagining all of the terrible things she would say back, but I realized she doesn't have any power over me if I don't let her.

It was seen at 9:09 this morning, by the way. She hasn't responded. Maybe that means she's thinking. Maybe that means she's concocting a particularly nasty retort. I don't really care, all I know is that I've gotten what I needed to off my chest and the irrational guilt I have carried my whole life  has been transferred from me to her. Whether she realizes it or not. 




 My boyfriend's family is giving me a place to stay. They're wonderful and absolutely amazing. I feel bad for all the kids in my situation who aren't as lucky as I am :/ 




 She told me I was ruining her holiday.
She called me an evil witch.
She told me that she rebukes me and rejects my worldly, evil ways.
She hit me and punched me and is standing outside my door screaming at me to get out over and over as I pack.
She told me I was dead to her.
And you know what, Reddit?

This is possibly the best Christmas present I have ever received. She's finally out of my life forever.
Going to be needing a lot of internet-hugs today, all. Love you guys.

EDIT: Thank you guys! I ended up moving in with my boyfriend's family until I go back to school at the end of January. We had a very lovely time at his family christmas. They always make me feel so welcome. I'm really thankful for all the helpful and supportive comments, it means a lot! Merry Christmas! 




 Why do you ask?

Edit: I'm an idiot. Yeah, it is. But he's my step-dad. He's sired the two youngest. Gross. I never want to think about that again 




 Yeah and they could go tell lies about each other to the animals living on it lol 




 Thank you for taking the time to respond like this. I don't want to be sad and angry every year but it's hard not to think of it and mourn for the mother and the life I wish I had. I'm also severely depressed, so the sad and angry parts go back to my "rut" thinking. 

I am extremely appreciative for my bf. I don't think he will ever realize what that small gesture meant to me. If he hadn't everything would have been shit. It's extremely symbolic of the role he plays in the rest of my life, as well.  




 She is. I have LC with her. She seems to be coming around, the tiniest bit. This incident was summer of 2013. Like I said, she's not as bad as some Nmoms. She still digs into me but the LC is helping a little bit. I am extremely anxious to go home for winter break, because I don't want things to go to shit like they had last winter and this past summer. My bf's mom has already offered to let me stay at their house as soon as things get bad. 

She has a bad background as well and while I understand that, I don't accept it as an excuse for her behavior. She's treated me badly and I've not treated people like she has. All I can do is hope that she can behave herself for a month or so.  




 I have lots of stories about my mom that I could tell you guys, but this was one that will stick with me for the rest of my life. Now, my mother doesn't exhibit all N behaviors, but many of them. The most prevalent of them is conditional "unconditional" love, as well as treating me as property.

To give a little bit of background, I grew up in a poor family. My mother is the only income for five kids. When I went off to college, I knew I would be paying for it all on my own, so I did, obviously not expecting any help.

In our family, my mother, my two sisters, my little brother, my boyfriend, and my boyfriend's mom ALL have birthdays within three weeks of Christmas. To any normal person, it would be understandable that, come Christmas time, I wouldn't have a lot of money for presents, right? I made cards for everyone, wished everyone happy birthdays and hugged them and told them I loved them. 

For my parents' anniversary in May, I couldn't afford to give them anything but a card and tell them Happy Anniversary and offer to babysit so they could go on a date.

For both of these events, my mother huffed and puffed and made a big deal about how I didnt appreciate her on her most special days and starting screaming at me about how she would ALWAYS make sure that us kids had presents on Christmas and our birthdays and on any other special days. I just took the abuse, but how can you expect an extremely poor, extremely depressed college kid with no time for a job and no car to afford 300 dollars worth of gifts?

So, come my birthday in August, I wake up in the morning, excited about my special day. Usually my dad and siblings will decorate the dining room and there will be presents on the table. I woke up, and there was nothing. That was fine with me, I could deal with it if my mom was angry with me. I didn't know it would actually be worse than that. 

She sat me down and told me there would be no presents for me that day. She told everyone to avoid looking at me, no one was allowed to wish me happy birthday, i wasnt allowed to see my friends (the few I had), I had to stay home and clean and babysit while my mom went out to do whatever it is she wanted to do. She told me it was because I didn't care enough about everyone else and that I didn't do enough to appreciate them, even though I had always wrote or made cards since i was little, and though all through high school I helped my mom out with money and childcare and sacrificed my social life (which I didn't have because she never let me go anywhere or see anyone) for whatever it was that she "needed" me to do.

I was crushed, obviously. I didn't care so much about the fact that I wasn't getting any presents, but the fact that she actually wanted to hurt me so badly that she called all of my relatives telling them not to call me on my birthday, or send presents, and told my immediate family that they were allowed to treat me like shit on my birthday.  It was also hard to  realize that I actually was a scapegoat and I wasn't just imagining it. I have a brother who is only two years my junior and she expected none of these things from him. It was humiliating and degrading.

I cried all day that day. I did exactly as she told me to. My Edad was cold and cruel to me, and wouldn't let me sit down to cry even for a minute, and threatened to call my mother if I didn't get up. I watched the kids while he napped and watched tv. My boyfriend, a knight in shining armor if I've ever seen one, came over anyway and gave me a dozen roses. I didn't let him come in the house, and let him stay for only ten minutes for fear that he would become the next target of my mother's craziness later on.

I will think about this and be sad and angry EVERY YEAR on my birthday because of this. I will think of the time I felt worthless and ignored and helpless. And every present or praise I receive from her will never feel like love and will always tell me that I only got those things from her because I have sated her selfish appetite.

It completely ruined any trust I was trying to have with her. I now see that "love" is a transaction for her and I am very hesitant to accept any help or gifts from her, because I know it comes with leverage for bargain and manipulation. It's spilled into all of my other relationships with people too. I cannot accept help, even when I need it, and am very suspicious of those who make offers with no strings attached. I will always resent her for that. 
 









 Its actually not the best quality of metal. I ordered it pretty cheap on Amazon because I just wanted a little variety. The metal is pretty bad to tell the truth but it looks so nice. As long as I only wear it for a day or two it doesnt irritate me or turn my nose green but I wouldn't risk wearing it for longer than that at a time. Bad, I know. But I was desperate haha.  




 Thank you! 




 Haha do it! It would look great on you! 



















 Exactly :) 




 I only drink like once a week, but the people I hang out like to make fun of the fact that I'm a lightweight and that one drink too many can put me way over. I don't puke or run off or turn into an asshole, it's just really apparent that I'm drunk when I am. 









 What color did you use? Look gorg! 




 Where did you order these? They look cute on you! 




 Wow! What color is this? 




 You look like Ariana Grande! 




 Where did you get that jewelry from? 




 Its hard to get a good picture and the turquoise is actually much darker than this. I can't get one myself because the tattoo ends up looking distorted 




 Yeah, I wasn't referring to the style. The style is geometric. It reminds me of a tribal drawing so that's what I called it
