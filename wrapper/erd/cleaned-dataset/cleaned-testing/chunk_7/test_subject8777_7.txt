 I hope they read these comments and then start saying this shit to their computer screens 




 They need to credit explosions in the sky for using their beautiful music to help promote their magnet board 




 Naw, she's just big boned.. BIG BONED 




 It turned out to be fake.. 




 Imagine the cameraman's surprise to be catching this amazing display of romance  




 Looked more like puffin to me 




 Religion, the longest lasting game of telephone in the world  




 For whatever reason, this is creepy as all hell to me 




 Does it play!!??

 Just don't drink and drive. It's simple. And anyone who says it's not that easy is making excuses for themselves  




 Yes, yes I do

 So first of faggot, he has been going to that lady for over 35 years.. Secondly, if barbershops weren't full of pretentious douche bags like yourself, maybe I would have considered it. 




 The shock of having a gay grandson too much for him?

 My grandfather has been getting his hair cut from the same lady for over 35yrs which is why we went there :)

 Regular musician here, see back room castings.. 




 Burning man is not that great unless ur a huge hippy.. Otherwise it's a dirty dusty place with tons of fucked up pple in a relatively small space thinking they are more artsy than the next person... In the end, the burning man event does more damage to the surrounding land than anything else despite everyone being "Eco" friendly.. 














 Absolutely gorgeous, I keep going back to your pics.. :) 














 Getting some friends together tmrw and buying some cards to send off!! 




 Lucky workout equip! 




 Do it! If nothing else it's fun to get out there and at least look.. Equipment can be expensive however, and we work somewhere where we are able to get a lot of scrap metal and other pieces and make a lot of what we have ourselves..bt we have a high banker, single level sluice box, tons of hoses to gravity feed water, lots of buckets and wash bins, classifiers shovels and rock picks 




 The paper process is quite involved and there are a few ways of going about it. You can stake a claim on lands that the BLM have allowed for mineral harvesting. But you would need to check with the  LR2000 to make sure it's not already claimed and that is a whole process in itself! Talk to your county's mineralogist  and possibly visit the BLM offices, they will help you as much as they can..at least they did for us here in CA... 

You can also buy claims from people who are selling then but they tend to be a little more expensive but at least that way you are paying for the paperwork being done and just a transfer in title is all that is needed at that point and then putting up the proper signs on your claim..
