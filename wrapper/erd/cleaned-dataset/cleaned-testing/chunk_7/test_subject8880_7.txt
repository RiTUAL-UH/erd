 I walked 2 miles in a severe thunderstorm once and never got hit by lightning. 




  Bill O'Reilly

Is he a dickhead in real life? 




 I'm a guy and when some chick I'm not interested in tries to conversate with me I tell them to fuck off. I expect the same treatment because I actually respect your honesty. 




 Or he has spiked your drink. 




 I like the cut of your jib. 




 HOGZILLA RETURNS? 




 That's like half of reddit! 




 thank mr skeltal! 




 That's cat-tastic. 




 Thanks Obama 




 Anyone banned from /r/pyongyang yet? 




 You forgot Iron Man 2020 Arno Stark! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_2020 




 * 60% of the time, it works every time 




 I actually stood up and clapped when the guy finished a tearful speech about his wife who killed herself.

 http://www.youtube-mp3.org/ can help. 









 The Fedora is strong with this one..... 




 Anyone see a man in the bushes too? 




 Exactly. Hey Fatasses line was sarcasm. Sarcasm is now a lost art. 




 And /r/cocaine is a helluva drug. 




 No, because reddits is not a part of free culture and never was. It's a private company that has the right to run its business however it sees fit. If you don't like it, leave. 

I asked a question so please chill. Offended by a question? Then you are part of the problem.


 Those of us who are capable of respecting and appreciating each other will not miss you one bit.

Why so offended by a simple question? Did the fedora get too tight around the fat that you have to want me to leave? Bitch please.

I hope and pray that this is just the beginning of the cleansing of reddit. Fatpeoplehate was a good start.

No. It was not. you got some really horrible subreddits of dead kids and your chubby ass gets all silly about r/fatpeoplehate? 

There are more that deserve to meet the same fate.
That a threat or a promise?
 




 I could answer my own question but I rather learn from experiences from any seafarers or sailors....  




 Guess that makes me the Kingpin. 




 Was you expecting Shakespeare? 




  Stop! It's just got worse. Not one entre has left together yet. NOT ONE!  You fucked me on the risotto!  You screwed me on the duck and now I got a raw bass! What are you going to do now?! Any suggestions? 




 The theory why time is broken in the DC Universe. Darkseid turned Barry Allen into a human bullet of Anti-Life. 




 [throws his pencil across the Red kitchen] Fuck off pathetic bunch of fucking women [leaves the Red kitchen] 




 That's there beef sliced, sourced, ready garnish there salmon not ready. It's the story all the night you can't even get two fucking dishes together. That's how shit you've (Rosann and Jen) been. Yeah fuck, fuck off [slams the table's entrees on to Jen's station] start THE FUCKING TABLE AGAIN!!! I've had enough for me okay? It's not good enough for me, I've had ENOUGH! ENOUGH! 




 Oh, fucking hell, what is she doing? Put the pan down! Put it down! Put the pan down! Just fucking let go. Look, this is where you are. Just stop, this is where you are. Touch that. [Jen walks away] Hey, hey, just come here! Fucking come here! All of you. That's you as well stroppy face. I don't know what it is with you, but you've given up and it fucking shows! The way you mope, the way you turn and the fucking chips on your shoulder. I'VE HAD ENOUGH! 




 Look at him, speedy, quickly, yeah? Just touch that, you can see how pink it is already. Fucking hell. I just want you to know what you're doing! None of you are communicating, no-one's going together, no-one's making eye contact, and no-one's reminding each other as a team! 




 Every 16 year-old girl filled out these comment cards this evening. Gentlemen, out of all the customers you cooked for tonight, 98% of them said they'd come back. Brilliant! Ladies, on the other hand... 99% of your customers would come back. (the women cheer loudly, while the men look dismayed) Actually, tonight, there's no losing team. I can't seriously decide on a winning team on a difference of 1%. 




 Bobby, little fine for the team spirit helping them out, but did you listen to what I said? You're cooking it, he's (Matt) running around wiping your arse [to Matt] and the said thing about you, hey, you let him. If I was running this section and I was in Hell's Kitchen running the fish, give me this give me that, I'm staying here, I'm cooking! 




 Mashed, carrots now! I can't go unless I've got the veg! What is going on Rosann? Oh my god, almighty. This is fucking meltdown. Out of the way please. 




 Come here with those burgers. Why are we cooking the burgers off so early on? They're like ice hockey pucks!  




 Holy Mackerel, did you fuck the chicken? What did you do to that? 




 Two salmon, one beef, one wellington. Unbelievable.  




  Hey you, come here! I've had enough! You can't even get two fucking dishes together. That's how shit you've been! I don't want any more embarrassments. I JUST WANT TO GO WITH SOME FOOD!! 




 After a disastrous start to the signature dish tasting, Chef Ramsay has lost more than just his hope. 




 Nothing upsets Chef Ramsay more than when customers come to the kitchen. 




 Blue Beetle Ted Kord = Chicago Cubs 




 That dead detective was a corpse the whole time he solved crimes. GENIUS! 




 Youtube the movie Hawkeye. It's just as good. 




 They would be the last survivors of WW3 if it breaks out. 




 It's Florida. You go batshit insane too if you lived there. 




 37 here. Didn't give a fuck then. Don't give a fuck now. 




 [I thought the Green Man was in Philly?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLbasu-bDQA)

 Dat pic of you on the speaker in pic 1.... 




 Someone gif his eyes so when your looking at it, his eyes meet yours. 




 Guess I'm beating off to the wrong things.
 




 It's all bullshit. 




 I remember missing Looney Toons because of that guy. 




 [Gobbledygook is this....](http://www.amazon.com/Gobbledygook-1-Kevin-Eastman/dp/B000PH49BE)
Also X-Men 130 is a lightly worn reader copy. Few creases in the cover and I have no idea what the coloring of the paper is. Havent got to take the book out yet. 




 Da fuck is wrong with people? 









 ..../r/cocaine is the ticket. 




 You thought he died in Cleveland too? 




 What's the back story on this? 




 TIL Billy Crystal had a show. 




 Black People! 




 You seen CMT lately? 




 Surely you can't be serious. 




 [John Candy as Orson Welles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6N8ADDDs0k) 




 Someone did a John Holmes cumshot video awhile back and said it was him murdering people. 




 Just a curious party trying to obtain some older DLC or games to fill up the old xbox drive. 




 MARVEL STILL OWNS THE 4 AND XMEN! 




 Now I know why I didn't catch it. It was censored. 




 I never seen that in any copy of Final Crisis  




 DC confuses me. 




 Hi. I'm MC Pee Pants and this is DJ Wacky Doo.

 Cocaine. 




 You want the 2nd Deadpool for it (X-Force 2)? 




 How they get him to hold still for the photo? 




 Mr.Rogers. 




 Infinite Special Ed. Minions = A World ruled by the Potato Pack. 




 Savage Dragon still kicks ass after years of Erik Larsen putting him in real time.
Also 1963 by Alan Moore. It's a damn good book that was over printed but it was fun. 




 Capt.Atom, Capt.Adam, Dr.Manhatten, Firestorm, the Nuclear Family, Deadman,etc. 




 It's like DC went B-Movie in this book. 




 How about a sequel involving a cloned ninja George Washington who leads an army of robot Bill Clintons on motorcycles? 




 Guess he was making his tower collapse...if you know what I mean. 




 What comics you need? 




 Rock 103 Memphis now play the Ramones and the Sex Pistols. I shit my pants when I heard Breaking Benjamin and Saliva on there the other day. 




 The League Of Crosstime Ted Kords would like a word with you.. 




 25 percent of my faith in humanity was restored. 




 Savage Dragon was a good book. Better than some of what was published then. 




 I'm as giddy as a schoolgirl right now. 




 Cracked existed when you was 10. Was you sheltered? 




 What is the squared root of 1,000,000? 









 Let us petition this. 




 Dan Dido is just a shit writer circlejerking his Silver Age child agenda. 




 At least Valiant was readable unlike Youngblood. 




 And it's Earth -616.34 where Teen Hulk and Obnoxio The Clown lives. 




 Mr.MTV by Nothingmore? 









 BASEketball. 




 Used to enjoy playing Magic The Gathering and Heroclix. What broke me? 
Douchebag Fedora fat guys who spend their life savings on cards/figures that I wouldn't buy for a grand and their smirk better-than-you attitude.
It's now a game of who has more money than you and has sucked the fun out of playing. 

....Don't even get me started on Warhammer... 




 Risky name. 




 Magnum condoms for my dong. 




 I once found a pile of human shit in a Wal-Mart dressing room.
