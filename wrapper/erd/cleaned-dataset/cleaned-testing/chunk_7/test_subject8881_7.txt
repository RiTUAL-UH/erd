 I caught this when I watched the first episode the 2nd time. It felt to me like this was a goof instead of a hidden clue by the writers for something.  



















 This can mean two things : 

1. Either Mr Robot is real and the show is just fucking with us. 
2. Or the Men In Black guys are also not real, which would explain why Darlene doesn't notice them when she and Elliot jump inside the train.

Whatever might be the truth, I fucking love this show. 




 This happened in episode one, when Elliot was following that Michael Hansen dude who was dating his therapist. 
[I made a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/3c0nlv/i_think_this_scene_makes_it_super_clear_whos_real/) noting how when Mr Robot is talking to the fsociety team, it's clearly Elliot they are talking to. 
And even in the bartender scene, you can clearly see how the dude doesn't even look at Mr. Robot. 
This is the only scene till now where Mr Robot had a clear interaction with someone which did not involve Elliot.
