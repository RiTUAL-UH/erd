 it's interesting that I stumbled across this sub and post today, as I just wrote something, [this actually,] (https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/32b6v3/wp_a_prolific_serial_killer_active_for_many_years/cq9yfny) in which I did not name the character at all, in order to avoid losing any of my readers to a poor (in their opinion) choice of character name.

In the one novel I have written (although it isn't published yet), I used some interesting names (Joster, anyone?), so I can definitely identify with the struggle... 




 thanks so much; I'm glad you did!  I was actually most concerned about the ending, afraid I may have ruined it with my impulsive twist.  Glad that was not the case :)

edit (clarification): I mean only the last detail of the reveal was on impulse 




 took me a minute to get that one 




 ooh!  I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought to go the government mind-control route.  You could develop this with more back story.

edit: figured I'd add a link in case anyone wants to see mine, as it's probably buried. https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/32b6v3/wp_a_prolific_serial_killer_active_for_many_years/cq9yfny 




 I don't think the epilogue was superfluous.  Some of that information was necessary/ helpful (the motivation behind the program), but I agree that it could have been conveyed a different way, within the main text.  Otherwise, good story. 




 nice short response.  I wrote about a chip too, but in an entirely different way. 




  if enough people upvote my post.

really?  That almost as crass as "Upvote if..." 




 your protectors?  
Seeing a shadow figure is interesting.  I usually don't *see* things, so I think that's more of a special gift (though it can probably be a practiced skill if one dedicates oneself); though I can see how it would be both a gift and a curse.  

There are some similar experiences to yours here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/324naz/me_strange_occurrences_throughout_my_life/ 




 wait.  Deja vu.  I read this last week.  I'm serious; I swear.  I'm not sure if I commented on it but I upvoted it and comments for sure.  

Just realized....so this must be a cross post from /r/paranormal then... 




 [meta] I'm sorry I had to make it three comments.  I thought I read somewhere that the limit was 10,000 but you can edit in more up to 40,000.  That didn't work.  It really technically only had to be two, as, according to Word, it was 20K char, but I broke it where it seemed logical.  Anyway, I hope you guys like it! 




 
"ARGHHHHH!!!!!!"  He woke up screaming from the skull-splitting pain.  What was going on?  Who was doing this to him?  Someone was doing this to him.  He did not, and never had believed in the supernatural.  Someone was giving him these names.  Someone wanted these people dead and knew he needed to kill.  Someone was showing him these people.  The same someone planted Pickett's suicide note and caused the media blackout on the case.  The same someone had probably made sure that he never got caught this whole time.

In the 15 years since his first kill, he had never seen any reason why the media and authorities had never picked up on anything.  He didn't know how he had come to accept the dream names as routine.  Now, as the memories were flooding back to him in spite of the pain, he realized he had been better off not knowing.  

In spite of every blast of pain, he remembered the trauma of his arrest.  They had made him for the murder in the woods.  He remembered the suits talking behind closed doors while he was left to stew in a dark room.  He remembered his mother agreeing to sign over his medical power of attorney and parental rights to the state, in exchange for his freedom.  He'd had to sign a paper too, and freedom was all he'd needed to hear.  He remembered talk of an experimental treatment to cure his need to kill.  The promises they made to her to rehabilitate him into a productive member of society.  He had never seen his mother again.  He'd thought he remembered having a falling out with her after he switched careers, but no.  She just dropped off the map.   He remembered the bright lights and antiseptic from the hospital room.

These headaches were not from a tumor.  The government had done something to his brain.  They had been feeding him these names.  They hadn't cured him of anything.  They had turned him into their unwilling assassin.  And they had done everything possible to keep him from finding out about the notes.  How many notes had there been?  

The pain wasn't causing brain damage; it was just an electrical signal.  Still, it got to be so much that he finally passed out on the bedroom rug.  *Or perhaps they could send electrical signals to make him pass out.*  He awoke what seemed like immediately, in a hospital bed.  He had the same characteristic headache in the back of his head.  He reached his hand up there and felt....bandages.

A man in a suit stepped into the room.

"You may not remember much," the agent began, "but you had one of our implants.  It was no longer of use to us in you, so we have removed it."

He blinked several times.  Digesting what the agent had said.

"This terminates the contract you signed.  You will serve the rest of your life sentence for the murder of Nathan Grier in a federal sanitorium, as you are not mentally competent to go to prison.  You suffer from severe delusions, and will be medicated as such so that you may peacefully co-exist with the other patients.  Take solace that you will likely remember nothing."

The suit turned to leave.

"Wait." He managed to croak out through his drugged-up stupor.  The suit stopped and turned towards the hospital bed.  "What happened to my mother?"

"She was a test of the programming, and the implant's ability to short-circuit memory." the agent replied.  "She was your first target."

-------------

TL/DR / Theme Synopsis: The government has basically been inceptioning him to take out targets for them.  He has been an unwilling/unknowing political/convenient assassin.  They took advantage of his mental states and psychopathic needs.  That's why the killings have been hushed and why nothing has happened to him.  He slowly discovers that he's been manipulated this whole time. 




 He awoke to the sound of sirens.  He sat bolt right up in bed, only to find that it was just coming from the TV.  It was 3am.  He'd never kept the TV on so late, or if he had, it certainly wasn't on this alarming channel.   The images on the screen seemed to send him into a trance.  He was sucked into to a horrible flashback.  He could see, first person, a tall female officer leading him by the crook of the elbow, his hands cuffed behind his back.  Images rushed through his mind of interrogation or meeting rooms, board offices, and dark corridors.  Then, in a flash, he could see a bright round light over his head, beaming straight into his face, and smelled the suffocating fumes of antiseptic, then, merely darkness.   He awoke/snapped out of it with a start.  He fumbled for the remote and shut the TV off.  He rolled over and attempted to get some sleep, although he could not shake those images out of his mind.

Had he been arrested?  Had he ever been treated for a mental disorder?  He vaguely remembered taking pills for something as a teen, but these memories, if that's indeed what they were, seemed more recent than that.  

*ARGH!*

He was suddenly accosted by a blasting headache as the sunlight streamed onto his face.  He had not had enough sleep the night before to dream of a victim, or even just a chase.  It was not a restorative sleep at all.  Two kills in one weekend though was more than enough though; he'd just hoped to let off some steam and anxiety.  His memories of the night before were rather vague, which is normal when one wakes for many short periods throughout the night.  

As he poured some cereal and sat down in front of his eggs and spam, he pulled up a search on his laptop.  He wanted to re-watch the news report from the night before, to see if it offered any clues as to who wanted Pickett dead.  No results.

*That's odd* he thought.  He tried rephrasing his search several ways, but still turned up nothing.  The only thing he saw was a quick mention of Pickett's name on the school website.  The blog was gone as well.

This looked like a thorough and hasty cover-up.  It was downright disturbing.  

A paranoid sweat began to build.  He wondered if the cover-up was all for him.

*That's ridiculous.* He thought.  *It's just the nagging paranoia that my day may be coming.*

He could not shake the feeling, however, that someone was watching him.  He decided to settle this by going to the public library, an looking it up there on a different computer.  

He brought only his keys, wallet, and phone into the old musty building; the juxtaposition of 2000's technology with 70's carpeting was a pleasantly jarring atmosphere.  He settled down into a computer and logged on as a guest.  

He surfed the web randomly for a bit, and then conducted the same searches he had done on his laptop.

No Results.

He began to feel light-headed.  Had he dreamed the whole news report?  Was there no letter?

Maybe he should ask someone.  It was risky, yes, but, working as a telemarketer has its advantages, and he felt confident in his ability to pass it off as a casual concerned interest.  

He approached the circulation desk with what he hoped was a look of concerned confusion.  

"Excuse me?"  he attracted the attention of the middle-aged brunette on a computer behind the counter.

"May I help you?"  She asked curtly, but not impolitely.

"Yes, well, I hope so." He began.  "My sister up in Bedford e-mailed me about a teacher who disappeared yesterday.  She said she heard it on the news.  I was trying to look up the news report, but I couldn't find anything."

"Oh, yes.  That poor man.  I saw it on the news last night."  She lowered her voice such that her whisper was now barely audible.  "They say he may have killed himself."

He felt the color drain from his face.

"I saw the report last night, online."  She continued.  "They took it down this morning though, probably at the family's request."  

He swallowed hard.  "Oh, well, thank you for your time."

"You best find something nicer to think about." She offered.  But he was already back at the computer screen collecting his things and his thoughts.

*So I didn't dream it.  It is a cover-up.*  Then, it dawned on him.  *Perhaps his sister planted the note.  Maybe she wanted him dead.*  But that didn't make any sense either.  She had cried on the news report, and her shock and horror had truly seemed genuine.  He knew fake tears.  Those were the real deal.  She had also said that their parents would roll over in their grave if they knew what he'd done.  So there was no other family to retract the story.

*What is going on?* he wondered.  Then, the headache returned, but so much worse.  

He had suffered from these headaches since his early 30's.  Since around the time he'd left manual labor for various positions in legal con-artistry.  

There was someone on a sofa chair to his left, reading a newspaper.  He walked around the magazine rack towards the bathroom, and happened to glance back.  The pages inside the newspaper were blank.

He ducked into the bathroom in a cold sweat.  Was he being followed?  It didn't make sense.  Had he left behind some sort of clue which led the police to a media blackout so he wouldn't know there were on his tail?

*No, you're just being paranoid.*  He told himself.  *This is like the Tell-Tale Heart.  or The Imp of the Perverse.  You are not going to give yourself away!*

And with that, he stormed out of the bathroom, too energized with adrenaline to pee.

He marched right past the magazine rack and made a beeline for the door.  He paused with his hand on the door frame.  Newspaper man was gone.  As he stepped out into the afternoon sun, he heard a helicopter overhead.  This time, it was low enough as it passed over the library for him to make out the labeling on it, or rather, the fact that it had none.  Not a single mark.  Just a solid, jet-black finish.  This was not your standard army chopper.

*I'm being watched.*  He thought.  *I'm being followed.*  He frantically looked left and right as he walked to his car.  *They wanted to make sure I didn't find out the truth.  They're onto me.* 

*My phone.*  he thought.  He dropped it deliberately behind his tires, and rushed into the car and locked the door.  He breathed a sigh.  *Good thing I couldn't afford the model with GPS*

He started it up and wandered around a few blocks before heading home.  *That was silly.* he realized.  *If the police are following me, then they know where I live.*

He turned the key and was dead-bolted inside before a second had passed.

He was nervous the rest of the day, but even so, having not slept the night before, he was out the minute his head hit the pillow.

His sleep was disturbed by the images he'd forgotten from the previous night.  The police station, the cuffs, the dark rooms, the bright light.  But this time, they were followed by bandages, and paperwork.  His mother was there.  Thanks to the medications he'd been on in the past, she'd always had his healthcare power of attorney.  But what were the suits doing there, in his hospital room?  What was he doing in a hospital?  This all felt like a vivid memory clouded in the depths of his mind. If only he could make sense of it all.  

Suddenly, everything was on fire.

He woke due to the searing pain in his skull.  It was strongest on the same spot in the back of his head from which the headaches always originated.  He could swear he had a tumor.  He'd been to the doctors to try and get help for it, but they always drew the same conclusion: that it was nothing and it would go away on its own.  *It's been almost 15 years.* he thought through the anguish.  *It's not going away.*

As he finally drifted back to sleep from exhaustion, and a jungle began to materialize around him, he heard a voice *His name is Richard Leery.*  As he seeped into the dream world, his pain grew silent, replaced instead by images of a man, his next victim.  As he stalked him through the wild, he felt a sense of relief.  But it was short-lived.  As his lucidity increased, he began to draw a damning conclusion.  He slowed his run to a jog.  *What if I don't chase him?* 

***again, last part is another reply because character limit*** 




 He saw a rustle in the woods behind his home, as he was finishing the body disposal process in his shed out back behind his quaint, rural residence.  There was a quick crunching of leaves as if someone had darted away.

*Why did I keep the shed door open?*  He thought.  It was because it was hot and he was all alone, or so he'd thought.

He quickly ran outside, only to find absolutely nothing there.  He stood there confused and unnerved for a minute.  He did a quick search of the area, finding no trace that anyone had been there.  *It must have been an animal* he thought.  

Just then, he heard helicopter blades overhead.  He ducked back inside the shed just in time to see the chopper pass over his property and into the starry dusk.

Helicopters passed over rural areas all the time.  Especially since there was a military base only a couple hours away.  This was nothing unusual.

As he made the final disposal of the aspiring senator's now indistinguishable remains, (*the filthy liar*), and made his way towards the back door, he began to wonder why he had never been caught.  Sure, he knew he was good, and careful, but even the best get caught eventually.  Someone sees something; they get too comfortable and slip up; people start to notice a pattern.  What is stranger is, other than the odd mention of a victim's sudden disappearance, there has been no media coverage speculating that any of these people had been murdered.  Not even a story covering why the crows and other scavengers in this country are extremely fat.

He chuckled to himself at that last one, as he sharpened his Bowie knife in the rustic kitchen.  

His first kill, at the age of 27, had been somewhat sloppy, and he'd really thought he'd be caught as a result.  But now, as a 42 year old veteran of the trade, he had the confidence and experience to pull it off seamlessly every time.  Life had trained him well.  So had his dreams.  In his dreams, he is like hunter; a predator stalking its' prey.  He even felt lucid in these dreams, using them as a training ground to perfect his techniques.  

At first, he had picked his victims based on opportunity, but he gradually began to seek out victims resembling those he had unconsciously stalked in the night.

As any trace evidence of his crimes went down the shower drain, he considered the strangeness of it all.  Starting back with his first kill.  Well, his first human kill.

He had chopped the body into pieces, and buried each one in separate areas in the woods on the other side of town, far back from the road, perpendicular to the river.  

That weekend, a family went camping by the river, and their dog had found the one closest to the riverbank.

Police had sent canine units to scour the area, and were able to uncover 5 more pieces of the body.  They had identified the victim as a missing person.  He only found this out through word of mouth though, as the police had taken caution to keep this story from going national.  The town was suffering as it was, and the last thing they needed was for commuters passing through to find another route or cease stopping there for gas and supplies, or for people to stop camping there.

So the story of 12 year-old Nathan Grier was kept under-wraps, relegated to hearsay and local legend.  


He assumed they never found the rest of the body because animals had beat them to it.  Scavengers.

He had done it with the same Bowie knife he just sharpened.  It had been a gift from his father, a veteran of the Vietnam War.  His old man had committed suicide after decades of suffering with intense PTSD flashbacks; he'd used that same Bowie knife, which the loyal son had carelessly left on a stump out back after skinning a rat.  He was 14 at the time.  By the time the body was found in the morning, the old man had no eyes.  He had seen the crows take off with pieces of his father in the rising sun, leaving behind an empty husk with a soulless stare.  

He set his Bowie knife on his bedside table and turned off the lamp, settling into the covers for his nightly adventure.

----------------------

*His name is Jeremy Pickett.* 

*So it's one of those nights...* he thought.  Sometimes, his dreams were more lucid than usual.  He had long been pursuing victims resembling the prey in his dreams, but occasionally, the prey had names, names which were stated like a voice-over in his mind.  He would usually wake from these dreams to get on his computer and find that these people were real, and really looked as they did in his dream.  

He did not believe in the supernatural.  He knew there had to be a logical explanation for this; he just didn't know what.  He sat up on the edge of his bed and put his slippers on, the sun making stripes through the blinds.  

He laid the knife on the kitchen counter as he set about making his breakfast.  It was a Saturday morning, and he was gearing up for a short road trip.  Jeremy Pickett was a public school teacher two hours north.  What he had done didn't matter.  He grabbed his keys.  Pickett was real, he was in the dream, and he was going to die.  

As the trees wooshed past behind him, he thought about these specified victims.  Perhaps he was simply an agent of divine justice.  He had ruminated over this many times, and throughout his prolific career, he had yet to come up with a better answer.  

It was high noon; he pulled off into a gas station to refuel himself and the Explorer.  

He expertly handled the mountain roads with a BLT in hand.  Before long, he arrived at the address.  The school directory had listed Pickett's home telephone, a quick look-up of which had provided his home address.  

Fully-covered from leaving evidence, despite the heat, he parked in the woods out back, and slinked his way towards the back door of the house.  It was unlocked.  *Simple mountain folk.*

--------------
It was dusk once again by the time he turned off the meat grinder and exited his shed.  Pickett had been a skinny fellow, but the woodland creatures swarmed excitedly for a free meal nonetheless. 

He was inside in time to watch the evening news with his dinner.  He had a terrible feeling in the pit of his stomach.  It was not the venison he was having trouble digesting.  There was a news report about the teacher's disappearance, as, although he wouldn't have been missed at the school until Monday, his sister was coming to visit him and had arrived that evening to find an empty house. She had found a note on the nightstand, that Pickett had written, which came across as lost and suicidal.  

"Police are searching the forest surrounding the tiny mountain community, in the hopes, that secluded though his home may be, they may find Jeremy Pickett still alive.  Back to you, Tom."

He switched off the TV.  This had never happened before.  Of two things he was certain:  Pickett had not been suicidal, and *he* did not plant that note.

*So who did...*

He was filled with questions, and fear.  Someone knew he had been there and killed Jeremy Pickett, and they were trying to cover it up.

*Why?*

Maybe it was someone who had wanted Pickett dead, was coming to kill him, and finding him already gone, was paranoid they would be charged with the murder.

That was the logical explanation.

*But who?*   He couldn't just accept that without any evidence to back it up.  He opened his laptop and began to reasearch.  Pickett had been on the news, so it would not cause any suspicion to look him up now.  

Pickett had taught History; most notably, Ancient Civilizations, and Security in Modern Government since the Cold War.  There was a blog.  He scrolled through the posts, when something posted two days ago caught his eye.  Pickett had, linking to past posts and various news articles, claimed that he had pieced together evidence of a secret organization behind several assassinations and world events.  Most insanely, he claimed the organization was secretly an arm of the government.

*This guy was a nutcase...* He thought, closing the laptop.  

*You're one to talk.*

He sat up straight and shook his head, attempting to shake off the delusions of the half-sleep into which he must have fallen on that couch.  

*I've overstepped my boundaries.*   He thought.

*What am I talking about?*  He wondered.  What boundaries?  *I must be really tired.  random neural firings.  I'm ready to dream.*

As he crawled into bed, he picked up the remote and turned on the TV.  Tonight, he felt like having some background noise, which was entirely unusual for him, but he really just wanted to drown out the confusing thoughts nagging at his mind.  

***the rest is in a comment below because of character limit*** 




 I'm not a scientist, but I will explain to you my understanding/beliefs about these types of events in the most scientific and simple/agreeable way possible.

Thoughts are electrical impulses.  You know how people reference being on the same wavelength?  Well, just like radio waves and sound waves (like from when you speak), your thought energy/waves are not necessarily confined within your skull. When people finish each other's sentences or get what you mean without having to say anything, it can be partially knowing someone well, and partially picking up on their general ideas of thoughts, the wavelengths which have made their way out from the mind.

You know how sometimes you can sense when someone is angry or upset, or you can feel excited energy radiating from people?  When someone just exudes happiness or fear?  These excessive emotions radiate off them as waves of energy, and although we cannot see them, we can pick up on it and feel it.

People who have closer connections to people tend to "read" them better because they are more receptive to these signals.

Also, some people who realize this actively feel for it and are more open to these signals.  


Think of it this way:  the waves and signals are all around us to pick up, some people just have stronger antennae than others.


Still with me?


So, all of that is just natural part of being human, and although I don't know the extent of scientific study of these concepts, it is a simple fact that we are run by electrical impulses, and it is clear to anyone who has felt that emotion radiating from a person, or who has just known something was up with grandma and had the urge to call her, we can pick up on the electrical signals of other people.  


Side note: Once you speak, or once a TV broadcast is made, for instance, those sound/radio waves travel forever (which is how we pick up on ideas others have already done and whatnot). 


About predicting stuff, I think this happens either one of two ways (either way, you're picking up on signals, the difference is how the signals get to you).  

1. Most likely: you (subconsicouly) pick up on things which will lead to the event, and your mind draws the conclusions from there.


2. Less likely, but still a possibility: These thought waves and similar energies involved in the question at hand, however may not travel unidirectionally through time.  Like ripples in a pond, they may travel round, or they may travel outward from the point of origin in both directions of time, like a number line.  Meaning, the event, even though it happens in the future (I'm still operating under the assumption that time is linear), may produce waves of energy or a ripple effect, which the perceptive can pick up on.


Either way, I am 100% certain (until/unless something happens to prove this wrong) that: precognition, in the form of sudden thoughts or through dreams, is the result of picking up on waves/signals passing through the universe around us.


I have precognitive dreams frequently enough to know it's not a coincidence.  And, unlike some of the other commenters, I don't just remember after the real event has taken place.  I make note of my dreams when I awake.  Most of the time, dreams are metaphorical, so that can be subjective to interpretation.  Sometimes, however, it is more direct.  The most recent one I had was in January.  In the middle of a perfectly wacky hodgepodge of randomness which is a dream, I suddenly had to go to the store with my mom to return a pack of socks.  And when I got up in the morning, guess what my mom said we had to go do?  Except, the socks in the dream were white, like what I wear, and the ones in real life were black, and had been for my brother.  That is just a result of how the information is filtered through my perceptual set; my brain's interpretation of the signals based upon my expectation/perspective of what a sock is.

I think that case in particular shows support for option 1 of how these signals reach us.  While I was sleeping, my mom was probably already thinking about the need to return the socks, and I simply picked up on those thought waves.  

It is a logical explanation.  Judge for yourself how scientific it is.  But, I believe you were using scientific/logical interchangeably insofar as finding a reasonable explanation.  

So I hope this is helpful to you.  I apologize for writing you a book, but I wanted to provide as much background and examples as I could, since this is starting from square one for you.  I wanted to leave nothing to assumption. 




 "willing or wishing things to happen" you mean like /r/energy_work ?

Knowing you're dreaming and taking control of it (to whatever degree you can manage) occurs all within your own mind.

Exerting influence over your surroundings in waking life is a different process/concept entirely, as the energy and intentions do not stay just within your mind.

I certainly don't think that consciousness is just another form of dreaming.  

Dreaming, however, is another state of consciousness.

So I guess that's really a matter of our frame of reference.  

If we were dreaming more than we were awake, we would probably refer to being awake as a clearer dream-like state.

Still, the mechanics of real life do not match up with the mechanics of dreaming.  You can use your energy to try and make a headache go away, or to make/encourage people [to] leave your office, but you can't will yourself to fly like you can in a dream.

So, no, we are not all dreaming.   




 so the killer's ghost may be in the kitchen....
But who is Rachel? 




 /r/shortscarystories 




 so you consented to be possessed by some unknown spirit with unknown intentions, and didn't make it go away?

He could still be possessing you, you know.  Just being quiet, watchful, waiting. 

He likes to prank he said.  sounds like a trickster.  He may be pranking *you*, my friend.  He will rear his ugly head again when you go to see your friend.  Sorry to spoil that for you, if you were waiting to be surprised.

Sooner you know, the better though, because the "pranks" will only get uglier, and more dangerous. 




 making glitches; that is interesting.
The only thing I can point you to is /r/energy_work , but that is not really a glitch; it's about directing your energy and intentions (which are electrical impulses) to a purpose.  The same way you can move your arm with your mind, you can try to exert influence on other things around you.


Instigating a glitch, like for example, making objects disappear from one place and reappear in another, is a whole other animal.

Now, people have certainly tried to do this with themselves and others.  I don't know if anyone other than Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka has succeeded in that. 




 maybe you are connecting with spirits when you are half asleep, in an altered state of consciousness.  The only reason I really think that is the girl.  It could also explain the other incidents.  

I want to call the last one sleep paralysis, really, I do.  But did you really open your eyes twice?  Could you have dreamed that you did?

I also have no idea what to make of the rocking, except your grandpa theory is plausible.  but I don't see why he would continue to rock you into adulthood.  

More questions than answers. 




 yeah; I wasn't expecting anything like that, so I made the mistake of reading this at 3 am right before intending to go to bed. 




 my thoughts exactly 




 nice to see mention of a tulpa.  I mentioned tulpas in [a post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/31rzm7/darting_shadow/) on /r/paranormal and they'd never heard of it.  




 hmm, well I certainly wasn't talking about "other emotions", but rather physical healing processes.  Such as illnesses and bleeding for instance.  like, when my nose is bleeding (I keep bringing this up in comments, but it's the most common healing occurrence for me and thus an easy example), to stop it, I picture blocking the blood flow to the injured area, sealing it off, and then the wound closing into solid skin again.  Of course, I am, while picturing this, breathing out slowly and feeding the energy to it.  Although, with things like this, unlike pain, the visualization for me is focused on the healing itself more than the energy.  I don't really see my energy in that; just my visualization of the injured area.

For more internal issues, it is much more vague and involves more picturing of the energy itself.  

That may just be a reflection of my level of biological knowledge though.

With a nosebleed, it stops immediately once I've done that.  Other things, not as effective.  So maybe it is more effective if you specifically know what to direct it to do.  who knows?

Either way, regardless of the specificness of your visualizations, ultimately, you are feeding energy in as a catalyst to the healing process.  So it certainly doesn't have to be so specific, as the body already knows what to do with it.  Just thought I'd clarify in case it's of any help or interest to you. 




 it could also just be part of the urge to write it off as a coincidence or trick of the mind.  If you think its silly to share or you might be making a fool of yourself or something out of nothing, you're likely not to say anything. 




 yes, please; other events.

and you did an amazing job holding down the fort.  That was incredibly brave. 




 yet to be exposed to this; now I will definitely check it out, but not tonight....

edit: nevermind; I googled it and yes I have read it.  I really liked it actually.  I didn't think the creatures themselves were that impressive though.

Maybe watching it is creepier.  But from what I just saw, the movie was described as "so bad its good", so... 




 perhaps weird neural-firings such as this were the inspiration for the slenderman story, because tall, humanoid, black, and spidery makes me think of that. 




 I've put things in my wallet or another very specific place, and have it disappear with no explanation.  At least you found the check. 




 I also thought of VAT when I read this (since I am currently in the UK), but I didn't know there was more of a connection than it being a three letter acronym.  Good to know 




 If that made it too the cover I can only just imagine how bad its' inside on the inside

I'm sorry.  I had to.  you're are picture is just asking for it.

Your probably getting fired up reading this, so why not take the energy and learn to are cook some Pizza?
 




 what's with the use of levels?   Is that a d d reference?

Anyway, good job!  I also visualize removing the pain or problem, though I tend to see it more as red than black.  And my energy I always see as blue, regardless of what I'm doing with it. 

But those are personal differences and irrelevant to the process.  You did well; the only thing is, as someone else mentioned, to be careful to toss it aside and not take it in.  Also, with different types of things you're trying to heal, you may find different visualizations more effective.  Pain is quite straightforward, but for other things, you may find you need to visualize more of the process inside (not on an advanced, technical level, but on a basic functional one).  I do; some others I've spoken to do not though, they just contribute the positive energy to the healing process.  

Just try things and see what works for you.

Good luck! 




 don't know much about seeing auras first hand.  I have a friend from HS who could (she said mine was big and blue at the time).

I can feel them though.  Aura color and size is a reflection of emotion (and, at a resting position, personality) from my understanding (correct me anyone if I'm wrong).  

What I can feel is the emotions and energies radiating off of people.  When someone is angry or nervous very much so, it radiates off of them and I can feel it deep inside.  This is an enlarging of the aura.

When someone closes themselves up like a wall, I can feel the wall.  

I can't visibly see them though.  

I would say seeing and feeling them are entirely different things.

To hone any ability though, you exercise it and push yourself a little more each time; but the key is to not try too hard; don't over-think anything.  Just relax and do.  Trying too hard and over-thinking causes things to tense up and not work.  That seems to be universal for all abilities.  So, just bear that in mind.  

Good luck! 




 this reminds me of [Her Name Was Emma](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29z7j8/her_name_was_emma/)

Really freaky.

There are people on facebook who I have a ton of mutuals with and went to the same school with but legitimately never met.  It wasn't a big school by any means, but big enough that, with the variety of classes and tracks one can be in, you pretty much end up meeting just over half of your grade from your various classes.  I could maybe have had gym with them at some point (since that involves congregating a lot of people from different academic backgrounds and grades) but otherwise, I didn't really meet them.

That is not unusual.  What is unusual is how close your close friends said they were to this person while you were close to them.  It's bizarre.  As long as you don't find a picture of you and J, then you're ok. 




 Not terribly obscure, but I've yet to meet another person irl who's heard of it.

The Young Wizards Series by Diane Duane.  It is YA SciFi Fantasy Coming of Age story which will empower and inspire you to live up to your full potential.

It is my favorite book series of all time.

The books go as follows:

So You Want To Be a Wizard
Deep Wizardry 
High Wizardry
A Wizard Abroad
The Wizard's Dilemma
A Wizard Alone
Wizard's Holiday
Wizards at War
A Wizard of Mars

10 is currently in the works

My favorite individual book of all time is not obscure at all.  It's : The Count of Monte Cristo .

Fundamentally though, I recommend that everyone read The Barcode Rebellion by Suzanne Wyrn (sorry if I mispelled the name).  It is a warning about what can happen in the world with technology and discrimination... 




 one of my favorite quotes is by Solzhenitsyn, and I think it *might* be from this book, but it's been years since I last read it.

The quote is (as I remember):

"There is a fine line between good and evil.  That line is drawn not between principalities and powers, but through every human heart.  ....[something about discerning the evil within one's self and doing good. (I dont remember the rest of the wording)]." 




 oh, ha ha.  I mean that was dangerous for the theif, not for you 




 um, even if his intention was to distance you so you dont get too attached and no one gets heartbroken, kissing another girl in front of you to nip it in the bud is the wrong way to do it.  That just makes the heartbreak happen now rather than later.  He could have just started spending a little less time with you and made it clear that you guys maybe shouldn't be too too close if you're FWB.

It sucks that he did that to you and threw away the friendship.  That was entirely unnecessary.

And being good close friends and FWB do not have to be mutually exclusive.  See this vids I shared to see an example of that: http://kineticpassion.tumblr.com/post/114937322020/full-benefits

Good luck salvaging the friendship if you really still think he's worth it after what he did. 




 3 goes out to you, man.  watch these that I've linked here http://kineticpassion.tumblr.com/post/114937322020/full-benefits

idk if it helps any, but that shows us inexperienced people that this kind of thing can be healthy, caring relationship.
I guess what I'm trying to say is don't let one bad apple spoil the bunch. 




  the WPP

this? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPP_plc

or am I /r/outoftheloop ? 




 wait, but he stood there long enough for you both to get a good look at him and the cameras sure did too...

that strikes me as really risky
