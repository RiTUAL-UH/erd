 Most of eastern Canada is incorrect. How much more of this map is wrong? 




 I don't think you got my point. 




 Money isn't important. 




 Wanna fuck? 




 [Ladies?](http://i.imgur.com/GWd1VDw.jpg) 




 That is almost /r/aww quality cuteness. 




 Idiot! Why would you tell them??? 




 Sounds like you have a couple of retarded parents there. Shouldn't be too hard of a decision to kill them if it comes down to that. 




 Looks like they both had this planned out. Pretty good sense of humour considering the cars they're driving. 




 /r/thathappened 




 Dude, chill out and let him tell his acid stories. 




 How hard do you have to kick someone for your foot to actually get lodged in their rectum? 









 Hay. 




 How many times will I see this picture reposted? Jesus, I get it, it looks like Thomas the Tank Engine died and rotted. Thank you, Internet, for beating a dead horse into a pile of fine, pink goo. 




 You're the kind of person who makes me proud to be a Canadian. Keep fighting the good fight. 




 I agree. There's not much sense in topping a burger with lobster, because lobster has such a delicate flavour that it is easily overwhelmed by anything stronger. For that reason lobster is best eaten right out of the shell.  




 I stopped watching this show in 1998, so I really don't care what they do at this point. 




 Probably the latter. 




 It is when the dick is as small as OP's boyfriend's. 




 Sounds like a club at closing time.

Thanks, buddy. 




 It was truly ahead of its time. 




 He's the one that will be all alone in a nursing home, dying with no one by his side. Why people want that... now, that's something I don't understand. 




 It was, OP, but some people just don't know what dicks are. 




 Is this considered aural sex? 




 She seems to not be having any of it. 




 Answer the man! Why do you want to be a catfish!!? 




 Light Sabres before electricity. 




 Best comment right here. 




 Those glasses... I've seen them before. 




 1. This is not /r/pakistanipeoplefacebook.  
  
2. Your friend can't help it if your mom's a slut, OP. 




 I watched the video and I still don't get it. Please explain to me, an obvious idiot. 




 How else is he going to get to (chuckles to self)... **school**? 




 TL;DR 




 Is your mother Asian Olivia Newton John? 




 It never gets old, though.

 This is the kind of guy who would pick vegetables straight off the vine and subject them to months of living in harsh conditions in his root cellar. 




 Fuck onions! 




 Or just murder him before he spends all of his retirement fund. At least get something out of the bag of shit before he's completely useless. 









 Fellow man-child here. Don't think there's anything wrong with how you're living your life, no matter how many times your family and friends try to intervene. 




 No. No, it does not. I'm not sure what made me come up with that. 




 Alberta plates. Enough said. 




 Good thing she comes with her own protective padding. 




 Herpes. 




 Please, don't do this. I have a wife and kids. 




 Do you have HIV? 




 Alcohol. 




 It would cost more to go to the dentist. 




 Not if climate change has anything to say about it! 




 If I could only pick one book, I'd pick a MacBook Pro... with a wi-fi connection. 




 At least you didn't rub it on your nuts. 




 The internet is full of nostalgia for the 1990s. As someone who grew up during this time, I have a lot of fond memories of it, but looking back it seems like a rather bland period. Is the nostalgia justified? Let's hear your thoughts. 




 Cat-a-pult. 




 Could this also be caused by a calcium deficiency? 




 Looks more like a bat than a devil. 




 No, it's just too snowy for school. 




 Savig the Capital Wasteland is all well and good, but what about the Mojave? 




 I put my penis in your girlfriend all the time, but she doesn't seem to mind when I do it. 




 I dunno, does it taste anything like pork belly? 




 I'd buy a movie theatre and only play Mall Cop 2. I'd then set up a trust and make sure that movie theatre operates for hundreds of years, only playing Mall Cop 2 for hundreds of years. A true memorial to the cultural feats of western society. 




 I had sex before 30. 




 Polar bears. You think they're scary now? Imagine a polar bear the size of the moon! How would we live on earth? It would take most of the biomass on our planet just to meet its daily dietary needs! 




 My nose hair is almost long enough to style it like in these pictures. Would it still be considered cool if I used real nose hair? 




 If she was unconscious, you could have still punched her and no one would have known. 




 Like, a whole penis? Was it attached to a man? 




 Don't crash your car. 




 After you reach 30, your FB newsfeed turns into post after post just like this one. 




 This wouldn't have happened if Gordon was there to keep shit from going off the rails. 




 They called the buns butt rolls! 




 He's on fire! 




 Monster jam! 




 That's not how you use TL;DRs. 




 Who's running this thread anyway? We need to put our foot down on all these jokes about the handicapped. 




 If you touch yourself to drawings of foot fetish porn, you're probably into foot porn. If you touch yourself to drawings of children, you're probably a pedophile. 




 *cringing intensifies* 




 It's okay, but nothing special. If you think you're missing out on something, go try it. Just remember, it's not very healthy. 




 You win, gentlesir. May you always be enlightened by your intelligence. *tips fedora* 




 Answer: Probably. 




 Keep us updated, OP! We want to know if you develop semen-induced pneumonia! 




 Why doesn't the moon spin? 




 The sign was originally "girl under a desk." It was photoshopped to say "Anne Frank." Does that make you happy?
  
Look, dude, all I did was make an inane comment on a silly post on reddit. It's what I do on this site. I don't take it seriously like you do. Judging from your commenting history, you're nothing but a loser neckbeard who sits around on his computer all day. If you want to feel smart, get out of your house and make something of your life instead of trying to pick fights on the internet. 




 Mmmmmm... tender breasts. 




 Waste of time. 




 She's 22. It's her college graduation photo. 




 1. Chug as much beer as possible before passing out in puddle of own vomit.  
  
2. Avoid eating head meat.  
  
3. Success. 




 No, I don't. It could say anything. It's a picture of a girl under a classroom desk. 




 A prison shower. 




 It's the best paying option available to me. 




 Just the same stuff most people are addicted to... nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, heroin. Nothing out of the ordinary, really. 




 Everything is the same, except the sign says something different. 




 I thought the sign was photoshopped, not the girl. 




 Nice photoshop. Not. 




 Cloudy with a 60% chance of golden showers. 




 This is the plywood spoiler of engine mods. 




 This is just bizarre. 




 Have one from me too. 




 Is this supposed to not make sense? 




 *cringes violently* 




 Butt love is best love. 




 The sound of fapping. Everytime I go to the bathroom, people would think I'm fapping. 




 This should be titled "Where Neckbeards Commonly Live." 




 Because I had to go to work, you NEET. 




 Ding ding ding! This thread has a winner! 




 Oh, the irony! 




 Since when is Lawrence spelled with a z? 




 Thank you for answering a lot of questions I could never find straight answers for. I'll be checking out your blog from now on. 




 I've made it pretty far by some standards, but I wouldn't say I'm "stellar." Thank you for the compliment, though! :)  




 You're calling it a "Christmas tree" and you think new buds on one is "mildly interesting." You're from somewhere tropical, aren't you? 




 A bakelite telephone made in 1954. My office has some serious issues with buying new equipment. 




 You shouldn't take things others write on the internet so seriously. Considering how riled up you are over this, you're probably just a big ball of stress. Want a hug? 




 Jesus Christ, that's a lot of makeup.

 




 young cats  
  
Plot twist: OP is only 30. 




 That's some minecraft level stuff right there. 




 Was it as good for you as it was for me, baby? By the way, we're now an applause. 




 It's probably mostly the penis thing you're talking about. 




 You missed a word, dude. You can't make dank memes without proper sentence structure. Any professional meme-maker can tell you that. 




 Surprise! It's another shit post on /r/mildlyinteresting!  
  
This sub is turning into a cross between /r/funny and /r/pics, two of my least favourite things on the internet. 




 If arranging plates and throwing a ping pong ball is genius, then I'm the president of MENSA.
