 I see debate all the time on here about buying a cheap car. Heck, I give that advice to people on here.

I'm actually sharing a car with my girlfriend right right now, but in the next year or so I'll have to get one of my own.

I care almost nothing about style. If it is safe and affordable then it's for me.

So what is the most cost effective used car taking into account MPG, potential repairs, how long it lasts, and of course purchase price?

Also, I'm assuming stay away from dealers? Or can they beat Craigslist sellers, on average? 




 Is that really true?

Couldn't someone just "sell" their home to a family member who would "sell" it right back to them?

Edit: [found a source](http://www.boe.ca.gov/proptaxes/pdf/lta12060.pdf) That's crazy! 




 Huh, I hadn't seen that. Doesn't mean you can't try! 




 Bitch my line breaks are just fine! 




 Ok, so an emergency fund is generally thought of as "if I lose my job tomorrow, I want 3-6 months of income." With that said, right now, I doubt your food expenses are $0. Do you work 7 days a week and eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner there? If not, then it's not $0.

Here's your monthly budget:
Car: $325
Rent: $550
Bills: $165
Gas: $100
Car insurance: ??? - assuming $100 for now
Health insurance: ??? - assuming you don't have it for now
Food (if you lost your job): $300
Minimum payment on CC: $60
Total: $1600

This means for a bare minimum emergency fund, you need $4800 (3 months of expenses). This is goal #1.

As an income estimate, I'm getting $2565 per month after taxes for you. Your current expenses (assuming $100/month for food and $100/month for car insurance) are $1400. This leaves you $1165 to save per month. Since you already have $3000 in you emergency fund, you only need to make the minimum payment on your CC for a month and a half to save to the full $4800 for emergency fund.

Goal #2 is knock out that debt. Currently at $1500, you just need 5 weeks after your emergency fund to knock out that debt. This means you put the full $1165 you have extra each month at that CC.

Goal #3(a) is build a savings. I saw you said your employer does not offer a 401K. This means you fund an IRA. Currently the limits are $5500/year. Since you save $1165 per month you should have this fully funded within 5 months. After that, you move on to an individual brokerage account where you can save money, but that doesn't give you any special tax breaks. I use Scottrade personally and like them, but you should look into your own. I also recommend using the 3 fund portfolio (http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) for your investing. They should also be able to set you up the IRA.

Goal #3(b) is an alternative to Goal #3(a). This is you going back to college. I saw in your other comment you went for 3 years for Biology then stopped b/c you ran out of money. You should definitely consider going back. The advantage to going through life with a college degree is so massive that you would be an idiot not to if you had the opportunity. How many credits short of your degree are you and what is the cost of a year? I would almost recommend you take out any loans necessary to complete your degree.



P.S. Also, never buy a car that expensive again. It doesn't do anything. If you make over $100K a year, sure buy something nice. But until then, remember all a car needs to do is get you safely from point A to B. Think $5000 car instead, the next time you need a car. 




 You sound like you have a very good head on your shoulders. I wish you the best of luck. If your situation gets abusive for you or your siblings, do not hesitate to call 911 immediately. Don't let him scare you into not reporting. Also, you should be able to advocate to the court on your own behalf and they will likely take it into consideration. 




 They did say it was pretty smart. So it could follow you into the bank vault and just wait in the doorway. It could just wait for you there until you tried to come out or fell asleep. Not like it had anywhere better to be. 




 I can see it now: he gives the mom the money and gets a lien on the home. Now the mom can't make the payments to him so he initiates... foreclosure, getting back to the original problem. 




 Jesus Christ you need to stop loaning ANYONE money. After your brother pays you back you need to get out of that game. Your parents should not expect it. If anyone asks just say you're sorry but don't have the budget for it.

Also, you need to sit down and have a serious discussion with your gf. I saw in another reply you said you plan on marrying her a bit down the road. If so, you need to discuss together if you two will be subsidizing her mother, because if she continues this now, I guarantee the mother will only expect it more in the future. If I were you, I would point out things the mom has done to shoot herself in the foot, such as quit her job when she could not afford it, take in dogs when she couldn't afford it, take in a nephew when she couldn't afford it, and take in an alcoholic boyfriend when she couldn't afford it. Show your girlfriend how irresponsible her mom is and that your gf is only enabling this lifestyle and making it worse by giving her money. 




 Pepper spray can actually be pretty dangerous. At 15, you're probably old enough to be able to handle it, but a 9 year old? You might consider taking it away from the 9 and 11 year olds. Then you and the 13 year old can step up for them if they are in an abusive situation in any way.

Also, you should probably have your mom show you how use it properly and actually practice. It's harder than it looks. 




 Yes, they take anonymous reports. 




 You are entitled to access to your cards. He cannot just shut off your money supply. You need to talk to a lawyer about this and divorce immediately. 




 This is definitely what I'm reading as well. To clarify for OP: this is something that they theoretically could take foreclose on your home for, but practically will likely not.

OP should probably contact the city tax assessor (wherever you pay your property taxes to) and pay the lien. It will likely be a similar amount (if not slightly more for interest and maybe fees to file the lien) to the amount he sent the check for originally. 




 Wait, you owe $1500 in CC debt or your minimum payment is $1500? If it's what you owe, what is your minimum payment? This will change how much you need for an emergency fund.

Also, how do you eat for free? Parents?

Last, trade down in your car if possible. How much is it worth? 




 I get it. I accept that there will be reposts. But wasn't this just reposted last week? 




 That's.... a unique take on things... 




 Right. And I think universal healthcare is the way to go. It's cheaper per person.

I'm just saying with the way the US is set up, we can't have open enrollment year round. 




 Unfortunately it's necessary. Since they are not allowed to discriminate based on preexisting condition, everyone could just not pay for health insurance until they get a major illness and then all the insurance companies would go bankrupt and nobody could get health insurance. 




 Yea, sounds like he's just horrible at flirting. You say he's been celibate for 5 years? He's probably REALLY out of practice at flirting.

Next time you're with him in a private place. Sit down next to him, look him in the eyes, and tell him you have a crush on him and want to explore it. Explicitly ask for a response. If he gives you a positive indicator, maybe try for a kiss if it feels right. 




 Funny how it defines Ephobophilia as attraction to 15-19 year olds. I'm sure nearly every guy in the world would admit attraction to an 18 year old, and yet according that that, it's the same as attraction to a 15 year old. The imaginary boundaries we set make the world a strange place. 




 Let me give you a scenario: You are walking down the street with your friend when someone runs up and stabs your friend to death with a knife then tosses it at you. Instinctually, you catch it. The stabber escapes in a car but you didn't see the color, type, or license plate because you were focused on your friend. The police show up shortly after and you are arrested. Now last week, you and your friend were in a big argument in front of lots of people and you threatened him in front of everyone, but you two cooled down and were friends again.

If you tell the police this, and they offer you a deal of five years in prison, your "idiot" public defender would be the worst attorney in the world if they DIDN'T encourage you to take the deal. She would say it doesn't matter if you're guilty or not because the evidence would point to you being found guilty, and she would be correct. If you threatened suicide if found guilty that would not help in the least.

This is the world we live in. It only matters what the evidence shows. I'm assuming the evidence in your case points to you being guilty, even if you are completely innocent. How would you like the justice system to change to accommodate innocent defendants who look guilty? Take their word on it? 




 It makes me wonder if "It" would risk giving itself away by killing someone in front of that many people. Wouldn't all the passengers see her get ripped to shreds and be like ...? 




 I saw it as they never tested how smart it was, and so thought maybe it would get in and they'd electrocute it.

Afterwards, Jay knew she'd never escape it and so she just settled for Paul because she knew she'd at least have a partner to get through life. She wasn't completely happy, but it also wasn't the worst thing in life. 




 Can you give an approximate rank of your pre-transfer school? 




 Well if OP's wife does not own a vibrator that a condom would conceivably be used for then this is still an effective method. Or, if she does, he can ask her quickly where she bought the condom and check if she used her card there recently. 




 This movie killed it. I love my coming of age films and have watched every one I can, but this film easily tops them all.

I would say a distant second is Moonrise Kingdom. 




 Same. Me and the gf share a medium popcorn and large icee at ever movie. Hell sometimes we'll throw in a chicken strip combo. I know I'm overpaying and I'm ok with it. 




 Wow. This is genius. Because lets be honest, we're all telling him to confront her. But if she's at all a decent liar, she will convince him any number of ways it ended up there and just hide evidence better. With this method, if she hides it, she's almost certainly guilty. But if she tells OP, it's likely to be some sort of misunderstanding. 




 Interesting you bring that up. It's certainly something I've considered. I just need to sit down and run the numbers. Thanks for the article! 




 Police are mandatory reporters. They will just pass it off to CPS. Again, you are introducing anecdotal evidence. 




 I simplified down my situation. I also have a gf who will be graduating at the same time and bringing in a similar income. I've calculated what our after tax income will be and budgeted appropriately. 




 So if it were me, I would sell the car to a private party and have them go to your bank to pay it off, then immediately sign over title. That way you just need to focus on saving as much as you can towards the difference between car value and amount owed. 




 Dear god the interest rate on that vehicle!

I'm unfamiliar with how the process works when selling a car worth less than what you owe, but do you have to pay off the entire difference at once? If so, then do everything you can to get rid of it. Only pay the minimum on your CC debts and apply it to a fund to pay off the difference, because every month you keep the car, it is depreciating faster than you can pay down the loan.

So sell the car as soon as possible, buy a $5K car, and get a loan for that car if you have to. Or better yet, is public transportation an option for a while?

After that, assuming your car payment will be substntially lower, you should be able to pay off about $1800 in debt each month. Apply that to the card with the highest interest rate, making only minimum payments on the others.

You could be debt free in 7 months after you get rid of the car. Use that as motivation and stick to your budget after you're debt free. 




 Having a plan. If I made $50K a year and owed $75K, I'd live on $20K and throw $30K at the debt to pay it off in approximately 3 years. Done, no worries.

My situation is I am projected to earn $80K and owe about $105K when I graduate law school. My plan is to live on $50K (more than reasonable) and throw the rest at my debt until it's gone. Not only do I not worry day to day, but I sometimes splurge a bit because I'm comfortable with that debt. I'm aware that for every dollar I spend, I will owe about $1.30 for, and yet I still went to Disneyland a couple weekends ago because I thought it was worth it. 




 By arguing that they should not be considered "safe" to call, you are arguing they are likely to do more harm than good.

I vehemently disagree with that notion, as do many others. I think anyone who suspects child abuse of any sort has a moral obligation to contact them. Let me ask, how would you handle a situation in which you suspect a child is being abused? 




 LOL. The panic in someone's eyes when they need medical attention and the EMT asks their religion. They reply Christian thinking they are close to being saved. And the EMT just starts packing up, looking over his shoulder, "I only serve atheists." 




 I went to UTSA and graduated UT last year. The GPA did not transfer. 




 As someone who did a year at UTSA, I can say that the classes were beyond easy. They were easier than my community college classes. Now, a big reason for this is because I pretty much decided I would have no life. I went to the gym a bit, but other than that I had no life other than studying. I easily got a 4.0 in all 10 classes.

I'm assuming the quality of classes is similar at UTSA and Arlington. If so, and you are willing to sacrifice 9 months of your life to obtain your goal, then I would encourage you to go to Arlington. Baylor will likely be harder with a smaller chance of successful transfer.

The important part is to be totally committed. No (or very few) parties. And little time spent on socialization. I saw it as, friends don't really matter because I'm only gonna be here for 9 months. Just suck it up for 9 months and focus completely on academics and you will easily be able to get a 4.0. Best of luck. Let me know if you have any other questions. 




 While there are surely bad CPS agents, that is not cause to get rid of CPS. Just like we should not abolish the prison system because sometimes innocent people go to prison, we should not abolish CPS just because some agents lie or exaggerate to get children removed from homes.

Does the system need reform? Likely so, but that does not mean they do more harm than good. 




 Your experience is anecdotal evidence. The article specifically says "One data point I couldn't find, in the report or elsewhere: the number of children taken from parents, even temporarily, only to be returned with no finding of unlawful behavior."

 




 Man if you could somehow trick it to board a shuttle before takeoff, and get them to just push it out while on Mars... That'd be the end goal. 




 And I'm arguing you that you abolish all of those programs and replace with universal healthcare. It's cheaper per capita than what we pay collectively.

As for the supplemental insurance, the point is that some people will never be happy so you give them the opportunity to pay for faster healthcare.

And for being glad to hand money over, it's something that's the right thing to do. I know because right now I'm poor and know what it's like to need resources and will be happy to support those in need. I've given substantial money to homeless who were in need when I was earning money because I could see they needed it. That's what being human is about. 




 I understand that, but kids are not the best judges, nor are they always privy to all the facts. Contrary to popular belief, CPS does not just remove children at whim. They do thorough investigations and only remove when there is overwhelming evidence. If anything they usually remove later than they should. 




 I think that if the counselor felt it necessary to push boundaries, she should have the discretion to. Many kids are not forthcoming about their abuse. If 9 kids have to be needlessly interrogated to save 1 from an actual abusive household, I believe it is worth it. Yes, it's a hassle for those kids, but there will always be innocents in any sort of system.

The bar for defamation would have to be that she knowingly made a false statement. I don't know why you're assuming the counselor said anything other than "I suspect the following abuse..." She is obviously doing her job and should be given the benefit of the doubt. Of course if I am wrong, OP is gladly free to correct me on this point. 




 Do it!

If there's one thing you should have no regrets about, it's love. Since there are strong mutual feelings, you should not let this opportunity escape. Date him and if it's worth it, have one of you move to the other. Best of luck! Update us! 




 The possibility of sexual abuse was a different incident from the bruising. It was mandatory that she report it if she suspected.

Seriously, what motivation do you think this woman has, other than doing her job, that would be furthered by harassing OP?

Edit: it's not defamation or slander because there is at least a somewhat reasonable basis for her thinking that OP is abusive. He would have no case for that. 




 I did know they had supplemental insurance in the UK and think it would be a fine idea to introduce in the US after we have socialized healthcare.

As for the "free" part of your argument, I grew up in an upper middle class family. My proposal would increase taxes on my parents. You are correct in that I have little income currently, but being in law school, I can safely project that my gf and I will collectively bring home at least $160K annually in a few years and I will be GLAD to pay my fair share of taxes and subsidize healthcare for those who cannot afford it. This is because I have empathy and a pro-society viewpoint that supports the lives of people that need help. 




 Oh I totally thing it's a step in the right direction but does not go far enough. When Cruz says "repeal and replace" what do you think he means? And what would you like him to mean?

Because when I say replace. I mean that we should have a system much like the UK, where all medical services are free and paid for with a higher tax rate. That is shown to be vastly cheaper per capita than the current system we have in place. But I know that is exactly what Cruz constituents are against and believe he means replace with something in the opposite direction, which will lead to needless death. That is why I think Cruz is evil. 




 No, Ted is a horrible person. I agree with the other poster that he's obviously brilliant, and just chooses his positions for political ends.

Just for example, denying that global warming exists, which would result in defunding and initiatives to combat it, if Ted had his way, would cost untold lives in the future. Further, repealing the ACA would also result in untold death by more people not visiting their doctor or getting a certain treatment just because they couldn't afford it. If you knowingly attempt to cause mass deaths, that makes you a horrible person. Thus, since Ted is smart enough to understand these consequences, he is a horrible person. 




 Seriously. I feel like I'm crazy here. Why would the counselor not report the abuse? She's required to by law! 




 Dude not the same at all. The counselor saw the child withdrawn and reported it. The counselor saw bruising and reported it. The counselor heard about possible sexual abuse and reported it. The counselor is a MANDATORY reporter. If she suspects child abuse at all, she must report it. She's letting CPS investigate. She's only doing her job. 




 Yea not related at all. There's substantial reason for the counselor to believe the child is being mistreated. It happens to be wrong here, but that doesn't mean counselor a should stop investigating child abuse claims when a parent complains. 




 Thank you for some support. I feel like I'm going nuts. If I were a counselor and suspected abuse from 3 separate incidents, I would also report each incident. No way should the counselor be forced to stop just because a parent is mad about the investigation. Then wouldn't every parent whose mistreating their kids just complain to the administration that they're being "harassed?" 




 Show me stats that support that this happens on even a semi-regular business. Or are you saying that we should abolish CPS because there are some innocents taken away? 




 Honestly, I realize this sucks and is inconvenient to you, but hats off to that counselor. She is doing her job, and seems like she genuinely believes you are beating her and so continually reports all suspected abuse. Maybe you could turn it around and praise her for this. Telling your daughter not to talk to her is possible but will only make the counselor more suspicious of you.

If whenever you are confronted, you tell them you appreciate she is doing her job, and that she is a good person for reporting all suspected abuse, she may let up on you. 




 That would be a hilarious result of this new policy. 




 Oh, that makes sense.

So doesn't everyone basically get one "free year?" Like if I start PAYE right after I finish school and my income during the school year was zero, then I would basically not have to pay for the first year? 




 Bad is an opinion. In my opinion some of it was bad. Yes, I like the 80's feel when the monster was near and the tension was building and when it got really loud, but the high pitched tings did not feel like they fit the moment, and there were lots of them. 




 That's exactly what /u/xtrexjpsouz described. Your degree was phased out. You chose the degree. They phased it out after letting you finish. The school does not believe there are job opportunities for your degree in the future.

Their deciding this does not allow you to completely discharge your student loans. And why should it? You chose this degree, and even admit if they hadn't offered it then you would have looked elsewhere for the same degree. You believe the school is wrong and that there ARE job opportunities for this degree. So go find those jobs and pay your loans. 




 Basically, I'll be graduating from law school in 2 years and am considering going solo. Maybe not immediately, but eventually.

How would PAYE work if I have no idea of my income? What if I project I will earn $50K that year and end up with $30k? Do I just pay the differences at the end? What if I project $50K and end up at $80K? Will there be penalties? 




 That would be hilarious. Like board a plane like you're going to Europe, then just get off after it gets on, and right before the doors close. Then it has to go to Europe.

I would think it would just fly to Europe but then fly right back and resume its plan. 




 I'm pretty sure it could cross an ocean. From the pool scene we know it can swim. It would just swim slowly and it obviously doesn't run out of energy. But what I want to know is if it can board a plane and get to you if you're really far away. 




 You can hire a lawyer to write a demand letter for you to the broker. This will likely scare it out of them, but will cost you a few hundred dollars. 




 Generally the breakeven point for buying a house is about 5 years. Further, you are unlikely to qualify for a house purchase with little credit and low income. Sorry to be a downer. 




 It's crazy that Aldo is about to tie Anderson Silva's record for title defenses and he's not given the respect as one of the GOATs. 




 I mean we saw in the pool scene that it can swim. It would probably just swim at you very slowly. 




 I don't know the nuances of the law there, but maybe you had to verbally assert that you were invoking your rights to mutual combat. 




 They did say it was smart and it avoided getting into the pool. I don't think it would get into the container but it's worth a try. 




 So you need a mobile job. Also, can it ride public transportation? Like would it take the bus to get to you? 




 That would be a great idea! Another idea I thought of would be to shoot it with a tracker dart, so you could always keep track of where it is. But with the whole "it's slow but it's also smart" thing, I'd be wary about it tricking me by putting the dart in another animal and giving me a false sense of security. No doubt it would be worth a try though. 




 Just wondering what everyone's strategy would be if they caught it.

If it were me, I'd fly to Australia and sleep with a prostitue then fly that person to Europe where I pay them to sleep with someone, then fly that person to Africa and pay them to sleep with someone and then maybe to China and at that point is feel safe. 




 See I loved the ending. Just curious, what kind of ending were you looking for? Jay to die in the pool? 




 Just finished It Follows. I've been waiting for the last 3 weeks to see it and... Just wow. It did not let me down.

Yea some of the music was pretty bad but that was about my only complaint.
A lot of the shots were very well done. I particularly liked the ending where it's following them both as they casually stroll.

You just get so deep into the psyche when you see Jay getting desperate to bang those dudes on the boat, and the pure panic in her eyes when the window first broke.
I loved the concept and am really glad this movie made its big break to 1000 theaters.

Coming from someone who absolutely hates scary movies and only saw this because it was advertised as a scary concept and not jump-scare heavy, I just want to say this movie thoroughly delivered on that promise.

I hope to see more from that writer in the future.
P.S. What year was it supposed to be? That little shell reading thing made me think current, but the house phone and other things made me think otherwise. 




 Thank you. Anecdotal evidence bugs me. Also, nice username. 




 Have you tried contacting all local jails, hospitals and morgues? Have you filed a missing persons report with the police? Do you know where the car was when it was towed? 




 Look up Phoenix Jones mutual combat video on YouTube. That's an example. He offers to settle via mutual combat and the cops watch as the guys fight. 




 According to the way OP posted it, it says he only has to pay it back if HE chooses to leave.

If I were him, this would be acceptable provided the comply gives an exemption if he leaves for medical reasons as nobody could predict that. Although in that case it would arguably not be his CHOICE anyways.

Edit: saw he clarified below, my bad 




 Edit: misread question  




 Ah my bad. I took "current dollars" to mean if dollar amounts were current and I missed the second column because I'm on mobile. 




 1-2%?!? Not true at all. 




 That $2700 per year is for private colleges and inflation adjusted. It was $655 per year, ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION! Now I'm sad. 




 Did it seem to give you a boost in your internships? 




 Just wondering how well you were compensated. The TA's at my school make $1500 per semester, which hardly seems worth it.

Also does it look good on your resume? I got an A+ my first semester in property, which is the area of law I'm looking to get into, so I feel like it would be very on point. 




 My girlfriend got an accommodation just for 1L exams. Was not for ADD though. Basically she just asked the school what needs to be included in the letter and they told her. It was stuff like: what condition and what accommodations are you requesting. I would recommend you ask the bar what they want in the letter. 




 So what? 




 As someone with 187 tickets, plz... 




 Just to note, you can almost certainly sue the man who beat you up to recover medical cost and other damages. Were you wrong to call her a cunt? Most likely. Was the other guy wrong to beat you up enough to put you in the hospital? Almost surely. Also note, some states have an exclusion on liability for "fighting words." 




 Former realtor here. Can confirm, Zillow highly inaccurate. 




 Honestly, if it were me, I ask to meet up with her, and when you show up at the door, ask to just spend some brother-sister time with her. Go to a decently quiet place and just lay it all out there. She sounds like she's pretty smart, just a little overtaken at the moment. Tell her you think it's in her best interest to leave. Plead, beg. Tell her she can leave with you that night and you will help her get on her feet (then be prepared to actually do that).

If she takes you up on it, have her leave with you immediately and make sure she blocks all contact with this guy. After 6 months or so in the "real world" she'll see how crazy he is. Then just hope for the best. 




 Purely guessing, I'd think that the hospital the professor worked at said "you get free healthcare at any of our facilities" and so when they price out an aspirin at $5 and a bandage at $20, that's what they're projecting in the professor's coverage. This is in contrast to the mother of 3 who works at IBM, where IBM negotiates all the costs with the exact same hospital, where they only get charged $1.50 an aspirin and $3 a bandage. 




 As a law student, I'm loving how accurate this is. Never thought I'd see "shepardize" used on TV. 




 Jesus I didn't realize what a murderer's row he was facing until seeing it typed out. I'm not sure anyone outside the top 10 would do better than 0-5. 




 Do you mind sharing how? 




 Frustrated =/= angry

I think Poirier was frustrated. Aldo's just pissed at him. 




 I don't think angry = getting in someone's head. But that doesn't make it true. You're entitled to your opinion though. 




 That's a nice thought, but almost surely there was a contract provision that required him to return the money. And if he fought it in court, he would almost surely lose and just cost himself the money plus legal fees.

I'm doubting he gave back hundreds of thousands of dollars to a billionaire out of the goodness of his heart. 




 That just means you're average. I see that you go to a high T2 school. With average grades there, you are may get a semi-decent job. However, if you're positive you do not want to be a lawyer, it's probably wise to get out before you get anymore debt. 




 Agreed. If OP was a 3L, people here might encourage him to just stick it out for the marginal advantage it might possibly give somewhere down the line. But as a 1L, bail now. 




 I said nervous or scared.

If some little punk came up to you talking shit but he was like 5'2" and weighed 110 pounds, you wouldn't be scared or nervous, but you'd probably be angry enough to knock him silly. Which is what I expect Aldo to do to Connor. 




 Why do you think this is getting into Aldo's head? I haven't seen him look nervous or scared at any time. 




 If they had time, of course, but I was attempting to give a hypothetical in which it would be impractical to change out the candidate's name from the ballots. 




 Well do it.

You may have to take this to court if the police will not help. 




 I like to laugh at them. Not out loud, but in my head. Unless you're a 1L and they're being dicks to weed out the class, then they're only doing it because they have fun making other people uncomfortable. In that case, realize how sad their lives are that they have to resort to basically bullying people under them. It is then that you laugh at how pathetic that is.
