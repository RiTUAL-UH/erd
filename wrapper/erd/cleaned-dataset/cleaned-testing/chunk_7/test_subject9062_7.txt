 Really? I can see not liking those guys, but Robertson is in a whole different league of shitfucktardness.  




 Yep. Pretend sky daddy sure is a powerful force. Oppressive fuckers give themselves tax breaks for pied pipering.  



















 Fuck. Sorry, mate.  




 Makes you sick.  




 He raised his two sons after her death while commuting in daily, my mom has huge respect for him and told me his history after I became a single parent.  









 Really, if someone attacks him politically I'd be baffled as to why; he was a fairly well-rounded guy and had pretty much something that everyone could admire, IMO.  




 Seriously. Having raised those boys alone, I am heartbroken for him and his other son. Fuck.  
























 Fan of murder jokes, eh?    




 I'm continually disappointed in Colorado, which is quite regressive contrary to popular opinion.  




 Religion is poison, keep it the fuck off my pizza. Also, my kid's pizza. If children are required to go to school, school must be required to keep that poisonous brainwashing shit out.  




 ...and then we got dentures, as our teeth fell out after the impact 




 IN SOVIET RUSSIA SPEED BUMPS YOU 




 But we regulate cars and we regulate alcohol, and i bet that girl is held accountable. A kid picked up a gun and killed his [sibling/uncle/parent/self] [yesterday/today/last week/every day] and it's continually chalked up to an accident. This shooter should be immediately known; can they not track who owns what weapon by the type of bullet? If they can and they don't, that is fucked. If they can't, we should not allow such weaponry.  




 Good to know, thanks 




 Comment of the year. 3 




 Gun banishment, for some real change. Australia got rid of this shit right quick and saved many lives. America is catering to the redneck white trash and it's costing 90 lives a day.  




 But look, every corner has a big sign for the gun show next weekend! G'wan and buy some with no background check, YEE FUCKING HAW.  




 The fact that this guy shot each person twice makes me think this is a "2A" nutter making a statement. Also, seems the two shot were almost exactly a month apart. Trying out my nancy drew hat, hoping they find him before the next one. My brother takes the exit where the girl was shot almost nightly for work, and living with this gun terrorism is unacceptable. Either stop the nutters from getting weapons or stop everyone, we don't need to be taken out like target practice as we take our kids to school and go to work.  




 Except the bus they're driving into the wall has all of us inside. The economic terrorists that are our own GOP must be ousted and prosecuted and NEVER again allowed to fuck America as we've seen them do since Reagan.  




 The libertarians are the biggest suckers of all IMO; they work against their own best interest. I've yet to meet one who would benefit from more of this shit, yet there they are fighting for it - worsen worker rights, remove the protections against worker and environmental abuse, and suck that corporate dick to their own demise. Baffling.  




 I've played a little fork-y eye-y in my day...

 That and Shark Farts!  




 Go home Dubbya, you're drunk 




 It's cubist! And Finnish? They're just getting started! 




 Technically it's called a bridge condom.

 Cannot wait until all NRA assets are seized and distributed to the survivors of their scourge. Can't wait. Will be celebrating and toasting and mourning all at once.  














 So let's elect another bush? Being advised by the same wolfowitz? Fuck this noise. Dubbya should be in prison for war crimes, not painting frivolous shit at a mansion in texas.  




 Uh oh guys, he's actually doing shit! And he's not dancing the rightward shuffle!

all the DINOs 









 Horrific.  














 That was such tripe, I had to shut her off while she talked shit on the locals who tried to prevent their water from being poisoned. Why don't these "small government" folks support the locals who VOTED TO BAN IT WITHIN CITY BOUNDARIES??  




 Agreed. Hoping they have brought in the feds on this, after all the window shootings, woman shot in the neck and now this murder. Full on terrorism for people living in the area.  




 Yep. The woman was shot in the neck in an offramp in this area, and 8-9 windows show out. Sure wish they'd track that shit somehow. I know they track down hunters who shoot animals out of season, surely they can do so here?? This is awful.  



















 You (or the Huffington Post at least) seem to think that if a mass-murderer/terrorist holds certain beliefs no one else can hold them also...


Huh?? 




 Oh so much butthurt in this thread! Look at all the little Klan K. Kritters! 




 Amazing that they shut down the silk road, yet this landmine lane continues... 




 Sohanlal Bhartha Walmiki sodomized and strangled her with a dog chain  cutting off the oxygen supply to her brain and leaving her in a coma.

...

Walmiki served a seven-year jail term for assault and robbery  but was never convicted of sexual assault as sodomy was not considered rape at that time. 
























 They don't complete the circle to explain where the outrage comes from. They're mad...why?? The terrorists in Texas are CRISIS; the christian isis. The people living in poverty and being killed when arrested for no reason in Baltimore who then riot about the murder are comparative...how? When you look at the photo gallery of those arrested, you see that most look like they weren't fully cooked when they came out of the oven. Lots of misshapen skulls, fucked up dull-looking methy faces. Those defending the lot are likely klanners.  














 Just standing his ground for his beauty sleep; move along. Nothing to see here.

Apparently the shooters were worth all the front page coverage, but the citizens showing up to testify about gun violence in the face of the arms trade lobby weren't worth writing news stories about? This photo is today at the TX capital. Thank you to the people who showed up to testify.

 But then it's so damn bulky under the jeans. And dude looks prego if he does that  




 During a routine inspection of Stag Arm's facilities in August, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms   Explosives found a large cache of receivers  the part of the gun that houses the trigger and firing mechanism  without serial numbers, which is a violation of the National Firearms Act.

Stag Arms is owned by Mark Malkowski, who was a vocal advocate for the gunmaking industry when the state legislature and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy sought to pass tougher gun control laws in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting. Stag manufactures guns out of two buildings on John Downey Drive in New Britain. The facilities are co-located with another gunmaker, Continental Machine Tool (CMT), which is owned by Malkowski's father, Tadeusz Malkowski. 









 You too? 




 Maybe this gal?

 CRISIS 




 The pro gun nutters are the most insecure bunch. Always banning, attacking...seriously, the angriest and meanest replies I've seen online are always from the gun strokers.  














 Awwww, the same fucking retarded pathetic shill rimjob, eh? Nobody drives across from Indiana, huh. 

Pro tip: get off the NRA intravenous smack. It is bad for you.  




 Until we have federal laws in place, this is a fucktard comment. The officers shot in NYC were killed with guns from another state which has lax laws. Look farther than your nose, friend. You're being led by an arms dealer and are acting as a shill. _ 




 You know the neighboring state with GOP level lack of gun laws? Yeah.  




 Hope the parents are in prison with their access to guns removed for life.  





























 He's a Republican. BAHAHAHAHAHA. 

On that note, Bernie 2016 



















 Lincoln says authorities in Montezuma County, Colorado, were called after the two stole gasoline in Cortez. Investigators say shots were fired from the suspects' vehicle during the pursuit, hitting two law enforcement vehicles and the car of a vacationing couple from Germany.

Is this kind of thing reported on German news when people encounter gun violence in the US?
