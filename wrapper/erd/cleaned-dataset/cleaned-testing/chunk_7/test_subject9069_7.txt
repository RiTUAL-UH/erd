 I often shower twice a day, which is obviously too much but I like it too much to stop.  




 I'm not in this video, I'm just a fan of the director.  




 From this not very creepy article: http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-deranged-authors-who-wrote-same-book-over-over_p3/ 














 You looked more like her than she did?  




 "I'm not proud. Well, I'm a little proud." 

This was clearly meant to piss MRA types off so they'd share it and hate it.  




 Have you ever found out you sold stolen goods?  




 How necromantic.  




 As a former Eagle Scout, I hated camping so much for eleven years that going out into the forest in general is torture.  




 A year ago when my Dad died and word of it got around at work.  














 I wrote a quick story for NoSleep about a child predator, and people were suggesting a sequel where the guy gets punished because in the end of my story he's still in control of the situation. 

My take on horror is that doing so would weaken the story. That kind of moralism feels cheap and too clean. Like, in reality, I get both the feeling a lot of perpetrators get away with it, so having a punishment in this situation feels off, even though it's a supernatural situation. It also feels like it goes against the point of the story to make people feel uncomfortable. 

Of course people will claim that's an excuse to make exploitation, but I mean solely in regards to how fictional characters are treated.  




 Yay! Free balloons and rifle covers! 




 To be fair, for a lot of them, like me, it is kind of a choice. We choose to not risk humiliation, we choose to not do a lot of the things that might make us more attractive, and we choose to not settle for desperate equally unattractive people.  




 If he was too nervous to even be in the same room as a stranger,  I assume he didn't used to be too socially active.  









 That's not very stoic of you.  




 It hadn't been on my mind until the last second, but for my birthday yesterday I remembered several restaurants in driving distance that offered free birthday meals. So I ended up having three dinners. 

I'm killing myself at the gym but I'm not about to cut back on food either.   




 Yes. You're supposed to feel like sharing it.  









 They shouldn't be women's shelters. They should be domestic abuse shelters. I worked at one of them and they took in battered men too. Many victims of physical domestic are men. Yes, women clearly have it worse, but that's statistically relevant. 
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/05/men-victims-domestic-violence 




 In another exciting, stupid chapter in "/u/test_subject9069 Goes to the Gym," I tend to go late at night and stay for awhile because I have a lot of calories to burn and a lot of other people have friends or whatever so I feel lonelier being around a bunch of other people. Because the lights are motion activated, apparently I can use an elliptical in the corner and the lights will go out. Last night at like two a.m. another guy showed up who looked like he was in his forties and heavily balding. He seemed surprised to see me there cause the lights were off and I guess he had the same social anxiety I do only much worse, because he went and hid in the bathroom, periodically coming out briefly in his gym clothes before seeing I was still there and going back inside. 

Guess I should start coming in earlier.  




 Yeah? Wait til it's also like that at work and most social events like concerts.  









 I tried to take a satisfactory selfie but the lens of my camera broke.  




 Every day I hate myself more and more for the two years I spent burger-flipping. So fucking stupid. 

Yeah, I know this option wasn't available to me, but still, being a bit poorer would have been less embarrassing that all the scars I got on my hands and arms.  




 Last night I couldn't sleep so I went to the gym. I kind of lost track of time and was still there when the bars closed and people began coming back to the dorms, the gym being near campus. I was on an elliptical, my favorite exercise machine in the world, which faced out one of those windows. 

Now several times, people have come up in front of me and either mocked me by making exaggerated elliptical-machine-use- gestures, mostly I assume because they're drunk or maybe I look weird using the machine at 2 in the morning. 

Last night someone came up to the window again and started doing those little handwaves people do to look cute. I didn't really look but I'd gotten sick of people doing the arm pumping thing at me so I flipped her off. Then I looked over and saw it was by far the most attractive person who'd interacted with me in years looking kind of hurt that I'd done that, and then she turned and walked away. 

Obviously she was probably condescending to me for being the weirdo in the gym at that hour and even if I'd smiled waved back it wouldn't have meant anything, but still, *shit*! 

So, what are some of the ones you've experienced?  




 No, lots of people who have it way the hell worse than me cope with it by laughing at the situation. A person with a shitty life has nothing to lose by life ending and ultimately meaning nothing. Now someone with a sweet life and a potential to leave behind a legacy is someone who wants life to have a point and for humanity to keep going if only to preserve memories of them.  




 Of course it's better to be in a large city. To quote an overweight openly homosexual filmmaker that Kevin Smith had on his podcast, "If you are a gay man in an urban area, you are never more than ten minutes from a free blow job."  




 Hit on them, embarrass the fuck out of yourself. Then you'll want to avoid the hell out of them instead of be around them.  




 I think it's the amount of effort you exert. I probably could make myself attractive enough to stop being FA, but I can't get motivated.  




 28 this year and I haven't had a conversation with a woman who was a stranger or under fifty in months. 

Come and eat chicken with me, Beautiful. It's so dark!  




 You probably aren't an artsy type, but my thing was I found a guy who had an art project he had trouble with finding anyone else willing to help him. He was as insecure/creepy as I imagine people find me, but I just concentrated on getting our stuff done so it wasn't a bother.  Boom! I had an instant wingman and even though I didn't get laid, I know it makes you much less off-putting to women to show up to place with a companion. 

Then after graduation he moved away and since then I kind of lost interest in socializing and projects since about last year.  




 Horror show?! The pointlessness makes it easier to see it all as a comedy, not scarier.   




 It happens. A guy who called me a faggot a couple times and tried to pants me in gym went to prom with someone I had a crush on. I imagine that didn't work out very well for her since she seemed pretty feminist.  









 Inflation.  









 That German photographer. Just kind of an annoying stereotype.  




 Here it is hilariously featured on QI:

 No, not really. But living with an abusive housemate sure as hell did! 




 Thanks for putting words and sentiments in our mouths about wanting Megan Fox to make your cliche spouting more timely.  




 And the studio is probably pleased by the controversy this stirs up.  




 Last as in "latest" or "final?" 




 Succeeds: The Neverending Story IMO because it incorporates the 4th wall bending into the story, sort of. 

Fails: Rocky and Bullwinkle 




 This came up in the comments for a recent review of Jupiter Ascending, how it sounded like a good movie to see high. I was wondering if people bother to do that much anymore or if home theaters killed that off.  




 My point was that neither is badass.  




 Oh god no, that's the last thing I want to do when I'm FA unless it's cold as fuck outside. But that's why I'm planning to move to Texas this year.  




 Yay, I'm now "That Scoop who doesn't like it when Donnelly says 'cunt.'" 




 You asked for it: http://youtu.be/dbHhVEiPiMU?t=6m 




 So much dumber: Cartoon characters literally inflating.  














 Seriously, anyone that upvoted this here: Why?  




 We're probably going to want to move somewhere farther away for if it finally happens.  




 Do the compounds break down? I assume it's not because something like bacteria builds up in the bottles or something.  




 No, that was just the cover story.  




 That bit I'm referring to is the bit at the gas station where Walt goes up to the car of that guy on the phone, puts the squeegee against his battery and blows up his engine. 

I don't get why this is supposed to be cool. At best it seems petty, at worst it seems really stupid. The guy didn't do anything to deserve that and Walt served no purpose except venting his anger in a barely understandable direction with little fear of reprisal. It seemed to me like saying it would be badass if Walt kicked an annoying chihuahua or something. I just don't get it.    




 Eh, I didn't need BCS to be great. We've already gotten a great series from this environment, a good one in addition to it is fine with me.  




 I am Jack's nodding head.  




 Christ, I hope my fetish remains unattainable. It would be horrifying to see in real life. Luckily there's a lot of porn of it.  




 Well, the source was cited on the Derpibooru page.  









 Mine is kind of gross and obviously the sort of thing a teenager would come up with, but here it goes:

I had a scene where a sort of newly met couple were sleeping together. The girlfriend wakes up, can't get back to sleep, then realizes she's going to fart. So she gets up, goes to the bathroom, pulls her pants down and does it, and then wipes before going back to bed. 

Now, I thought that this was a character thing that would reveal how fastidious and insecure she was in an interesting way, but it kind of came out of nowhere in regards to the rest of the story and struck my "beta readers" for it as so weird and stupid that they actually got mad at me about it. 

Yours?  




 Bigfoot's probably juicing.  









 It's Spectre's sinister plan that's so secret Bond doesn't even know about it.  




 That's just stolen from Rebel Without a Cause.

 I've contacted... six people on OKCupid in the past year or so. And now I'm going to the gym. 

That's really not much.  




 I love a bunch of these, but it feels like a shame how quickly they'll become completely dated.  




 I like how only Pinkie and Rainbow Dash are at all into it.  









 It not only breaks the deal, it breaks me.  









 I had a thing in middle school where I absolutely shamelessly would stare holes in shirts until one day when a bunch of people at once called me on it. That might have made a little bit of an impression. But looking back on it, I totally deserved it.  




 "If you're staying at the pyramid hotel, gonna make you fuck sore!"  




 No, because no one's preventing me from interacting with them. I'm just insecure and they don't want my attention, I assume.  














 One day in September of 1983 we decided to go on a patrol camping trip so that wed get some prizes at the end of the year. Our scout troop owned a campsite up on top of a big, rocky hill. It was just our rotten luck that when we agreed to meet to start the campout, there had been a steady rain going on all day that didnt look like it was going to stop for hours. But our parents were all either going away for the weekend or thought rain was no reason to cancel a camping trip. Anyway, it was just barely going to be warm enough for this to be our last chance to have a patrol campout that year.

There were four of us trudging up one of the thin paths on the hill with our limited gear under dismal green ponchos: Me, Eric, Tony, and Sam in that order. We were miserable and irritable except for Tony.

We had reached a point where we enjoyed hurting Tony. Tony was one of those kids that get put into Boy Scouts of America only because they have a parent that wants free babysitting. I imagine most of the time his mom mostly talked to him by yelling at him, and the only way he knew to relate to the rest of us was to annoy us. He was also the youngest guy in my patrol and the shortest so it was fairly easy for us to bully him, especially when we thought he was doing his best to bring it on himself. I think Tony was delighted that the rest of the patrol was already on edge so it would be easier for him to get a rise out of us. At that moment he had decided to focus on Eric.

Eric was a real goody-goody most of the time. He was a pretty good athlete and an A student. Im pretty sure that at fifteen hed never had sex, a puff of anything, or any booze. But he loved beating on Tony as much as the rest of us did. That seemed to be his only vice, and frankly, it kept the guy from creeping me out by being too perfect. Hed certainly looked ready to give someone a beating when I glanced back at him during that little hike.

"Hey, Eric! Tony said. I glanced back over my shoulder. Tony had run up next to Eric like a puppy dog cause he knew otherwise Eric would ignore him. There was barely room on the path for him to do that if he turned himself sideways.

What? Eric said.

I can read your mind! Sometimes Tony would be weird or still like a little kid when he pestered us.

Okay. Eric said. I looked forward again.

Think of a number! I can guess it! Tony was pitching his voice up.

Okay. Eric said.

Its thirty! Tony told him.

No.

Youre just saying that. Really I was right. Wasnt I? Huh, wasnt I? From the sound of ponchos rustling, I assume that Tony began to push against Eric. He would do that for minutes on end if youd let him. Sometimes he might even start humping your leg if you were another scout.

Get away from me! Eric said. I didnt see it, but it was obvious even before I turned round what had happened. Eric thoughtlessly pushed Tony away, just wanting the little creep off him. As narrow and slippery as the trail was, he had pushed Tony off it. Tony screamed as he went down the very steep portion of hill, almost catching several trees before having his legs tripped out from under him by a stump. The stump was unfortunately only a little uphill from a large sandstone rock. Tony went into it headfirst with a sound of a loud crack! I stared at him for half a minute or so then, and he didnt so much as twitch from what I could see.

On my god. Sam said after a long silence, which seemed to snap the rest of us out of it.

Lets go help him.

Yeah. I said. Back then, this meant running down there to carry him to the nearest house out of the park since cell phones for kids were still decades off. I tried to start down the trail but Eric was still standing in the way. He turned to me.

Weve gotta tell people what happened right, Sam stopped and looked over at us. Eric looked down at him. We need to tell everyone that he slipped and fell, got it?

Weve got to help Tony! Sam shouted.

And we will! Eric said. But first, we need to be clear that were going to tell everyone that he fell, right? You got me, thats what we tell everyone?

I dont know, I said, I didnt see it happen. Eric looked and me, and nodded. That seemed good enough for him. Then he looked back at Sam.

You pushed him. We have to help him,  Sam said in bewilderment. Sam had never been the cleverest guy in the patrol, but I would have thought hed have the sense to play along under the circumstances.

We will! Eric responded. But first, I need you to say that youll tell everyone that he slipped and he fell! I nodded desperately at Sam, gesturing for him to tell Eric what he needed to hear so that we could get down there to try to help Tony.

No, Sam said. Eric stared at him.

Alright, Eric said. Lets go. We walked quickly, not about to run for fear of slipping and falling like Tony just had.

It wouldnt have done you much good anyway. Sam said after a little while, apparently trying to help Eric feel better. Tony still would have told everyone you tried to kill him no matter what.

Yeah, but thats Tony. Whod have cared if the rest of us had our story straight? Eric answered, his voice flat. He seemed to speed up from behind Sam.

Which way do you think would be the fastest to- HEY! Eric grabbed Sam. Sam yelled as Eric dragged him to the edge of the path.

Say it! Eric shrieked. Say that youll tell everyone that he slipped! Eric sounded more scared than he did intimidating as he held Sam at the edge of the path, seemingly ready to let him fall.

Fuck you! Sam yelled and he began to flail. He hurt Eric more than I would have expected, judging by how Eric grunted. Maybe it was pure adrenaline, but Sam got free somehow and began pushing him to the other side of the trail, right into a cliff.

Jesus Christ, stop fighting! I yelled at them. I might as well have been speaking Chinese. I took a few steps closer and saw there was murder in both their eyes, so I stepped back. Sam got his hand on Erics chin and pushed his head into the rocks behind him as hard as he could. Eric was really trembling then, like an old man with Parkinsons. It was as if he was experiencing a panic attack in the middle of a fight. Even so he wasnt going to just take Sams beating. He grabbed Sam again and kind of picked him up like Sam was a tackling dummy and then charged forward blindly, Sams poncho over his face. He misjudged the distance to the edge of the path and both Sam and he went rolling down the hill. They struck trees with sickening noises as they fell to a level area.

They were much more fortunate than Tony. I could see their movements and hear them screaming when they stopped falling down the hill. But neither of them even tried to get up.

I walked as quickly as I safely could down the trail and then looped back round to where Sam and Eric were. Both were yelling for my help at first, but as I proceeded down the trail, Eric abruptly went quiet.

My legs broken! Sam told me as soon as he saw me arrive where theyd fallen. The bones sticking out! It was true. His poncho had folded up and I saw the bulge in his lower left pant leg beneath the knee. Blood had soaked through his pants with the rainwater.

Hey, Eric said flatly. His lack of emotion made me look over at him as Sam screamed at both of us. I think I hurt my spine. I cant move my legs. I cant feel them. From what I could see of how his body was twisted, that might well have been possible. I didnt know then how Eric could be so emotionless about it, but in hindsight of course he was in shock if not in psychological denial.

Alright, guys, Ill go do what I can for Tony, and then Ill get help for everyone. I said. Sam screamed at me that that was the wrong thing to do, that I should leave the park to get help immediately. For all my first aid training, I didnt know if either of us were right. I thought maybe there was something I could do with the first aid kit for Tony, whose injury had seemed the most severe. Maybe Tony had vomited and I had to clear his breathing passage. I had to check on him. I tried to reassure them before leaving. Sam swore at my back as I ran over to Tony while Eric remained quiet.

I ran to where Id seen Tonys head hit the rock. I had walked by it on hikes and camping trips numerous times and knew the rocks and trees. Id seen the rock that Tony had hit his head on numerous times and knew when Id reached it. When I did, I froze for what felt like minutes.

Tony was gone.

There was no sign hed been there except for some blood had pooled by the rock where hed struck his head. It was still wet and red on the sandstone. I looked around and called for him. I ran a short distance each way around the rock. I didnt see a sign of him. Not a footprint in mud, a drop of blood. Anything.
I something else as I searched. Sounds seemed to be fading away. I could hardly hear the rain around me. I couldnt even hear my footsteps in the shallow puddles on the ground. I couldnt even hear Sam although I had been seconds before. My own voice seemed muffled to my ears. I had been afraid before, but Id never known the sound to fade away like that.

I began to feel something. Not the feeling you get when youre being watched, but the one you get when someone you fear is standing right over you. I turned, and there was no one there, of course. The feeling didnt let up. It seemed to grow stronger and stronger. There was nothing to hear, not even my own breathing or the beat of my heart.

I ran back to where Id left the other two scouts, as fast as Ive ever run towards anything. Slowly I could hear again that Sam was still screaming in pain and cursing out Eric. Eric barely moved his head to look at me when I arrived. Sam went quiet after I told them of Tonys disappearance.

How? was all Sam could think to say. I felt that sensation again of a presence all around me again. It was faint but noticeable.

I dont know. Sam, how are your arms? Can I carry you out of here pack strap style? I had two years and eighteen inches of height on Sam, so I knew I could carry him out. Sam said I would. Whatever presence I was feeling, he seemed aware of it too through his pain and he didnt need to be sold on being taken out of the park, painful though it would surely be. I got out my first aid kit quickly, left my pack on the ground, and hastily made him a splint. He screamed as I lifted him up on my back.

Wait! What about me?! Eric asked, some emotion back in his voice. I glanced over at him. His eyes were wide, and his skin was becoming pale.

I can only carry one person. Well get you help as fast as we can.

But, what if whatever made Tony disappear Looking back on Eric, I find it hard to fault him now. He was just a kid. Hed made a mistake, meaning only a little if any harm. The a smaller amount of harm that wed all inflicted on Tony time and again. Then hed seen all his life, all his accomplishments, his future, all about to be tarnished because of what hed accidentally done to someone we all mostly thought of as dirt. He overreacted like probably many of us would back when we had little life experience and perspective of a guy in his lower teens. But at the time, I just glared at him for a second as he lay twisted and helpless on the ground, reaching up to me.

Maybe you deserve it, I told him. I turned my back on him and began carrying Sam out of the park.

Hey! Im sorry! I didnt mean to hurt Tony! I wasnt going to drop Sam! I was bluffing! Im sorry! Ill do anything you want if you get me out of here! Ill give you everything! Please! Dont leave me alone! What was that!? Theres, theres something out here! Come back! Please! I swear that Ill do anything! Please! Pleeeaase! Come back! His voice faded quickly, and the sound of rain and Sams pain resumed. As I walked, the feeling of that presence faded as well.

I had almost a mile to go in the rain before there would be a house with a phone, and Sam was moaning and wincing practically with every step. I made slow, frustrating progress for a few hundred yards before I slipped and landed heavily on my left knee. Sam screeched in my ear after his upper chest his my shoulder.

I think I broke a rib back there! You cant carry me like this! I didnt know how he could have broken a rib and only started to feel it now but I wasnt about to argue. As carefully as I could in my anxiety, I placed him on the ground in a sitting position and switched the carrying style to firefighter carrying style so that he was mostly over my shoulder.

Is that better? I asked him when Id hoisted him back up. He had winced again as I held him up.

It still hurts, but its better. We rounded a curve on the trail and were approaching a fairly gentle slope where the parking lot was situated. I thought of it then as the end of the park. Sam had begun to feel easier to carry, so I felt then Id be able to make it out of this forest.

I remember that since Id been in the park many times before, and even with another scout on my back being carried like this who was constantly voicing his pain, things were coming back to normal. Whatever feeling Id experienced over where I had thought Tony disappeared was going away. Things began to feel so normal that the idea Tony had just gotten up and walked away and emergency services would soon find him was believable. I guess what I felt then was that all I had to do was carry Sam and then it would be up to the adults to take care of all this.

Oh Jesus, Sam suddenly said quietly. Run. Run! Run! Fucking Run! Before I could ask or turn to see what I was to run from, he struck me as hard as he could on the side. He did this again and again, even after I started running. It was difficult to run even a few steps with such a heavy, awkward weight. It became easier when I noticed something that was already too familiar: Sams voice became quieter even as he thrashed and screeched more shrilly on my back. He might have said what it was or described anything about it, but within seconds he was as muted as my silent steps in the puddles on the pathway.

I reached the bottom of the incline. Sam was convulsing then, which I felt was a sign that whatever I was trying to flee was getting closer. He was still hitting me in the side, but it was weaker and more erratically.

The path up the hill was full of loose rocks and gravel. In weather like this it was impossible to keep a solid foothold, but by some miracle I was able to run up it and maintain a hold on him even as he practically seemed to be trying to break free and I was trembling. I remember thinking that I faintly heard something then, something like a splash. That had to be a good sign.

Halfway up the hill I felt a horrible sensation in my feet. They were going numb. I remember not understanding why, and even with all the momentum I had built up, my feet landed awkwardly, like Id slipped on ice but still landed on my feet. I barely had time to feel pain in my ankles because they went numb as well. I was barely able to stumble forward before the numbness climbed up to my knees. My legs were useless then. I fell forward practically face first.

Sam got free even with his fractures, flipped over, and crawled up the hill. I tried myself. I could feel the numbness had reached my ribcage by then, but dragged myself across the rocks. I remember perfectly the sight of Sam dragging himself too while twitching and trembling as he crawled.

A force hit the back of my head that felt like a construction beam dropped from a crane. My face went into the ground, rocks stabbing into my cheeks hard enough to break the skin and I seemed to lose all fight and flight instinct. I just lay there like a breathing corpse. Even if I hadnt been numb I didnt have any energy, any hope, any understanding of what was happening to me. I didnt even have the courage to lift my hood up and see what was happening around me.

I dont know how long I lay there. The numbness left me, but I still didnt lift my hood. So little light was coming in under my hood that night might have fallen and I wouldnt have been able to tell. A long time later, the rain stopped. A longer time after that, I began to hear again. I heard birds tweeting, cars driving by from what sounded like miles away. I didnt move.

After a long time of only hearing the sounds of nature, I heard footsteps approaching me. They stopped suddenly, and then clearly changed to those of someone running up to me.

Are you alright? An old man whose name I dont remember said as he leaned over and pulled my hood back. I looked up at him, rocks still stabbed into my face. He winced as he saw it. Christ, kid. What happened to you?

I dont know, I said.

I still dont know. I dont want to. I know that Eric, Tony, and Sam were never found, nor was any trace of anything that might have made them disappear. I learned even that reluctantly. Look for answers? Hell, I dont even go near forests any longer.
Staying away from forests isnt enough. I have developed a need for sound. Always. After a minute without the hearing something, I feel anxious. Sleeping without it is impossible. If whatever got my fellow scouts comes for me, I want as much warning as I can get.

That brings me to the reason Im sharing this: Lately, even with music at full volume and me screaming my lungs out, Ive been experiencing minutes of silence. At home, at work, out driving, when Ive gone on visits, Ive been experiencing it.

Its been many years since the the end of my last camping trip, but it seems like Im about to feel that presence again. When it wants, I believe it will make me experience a silence that will never end.

 I remember the one for Scott Pilgrim being pretty dull.  




 We need to wear scarlet letters.  




 So last night I went to it for the first time in like six months. There were some extremely attractive women there and it's not a big place but since they looked about 19 and I'm 28 (and out of shape) I knew they'd really rather not be leered at by me, and "leering" when you're the creepy old guy means "looking at at all." So for an hour and a half I had to look away from these people in a fairly enclosed space. 

I don't mean to whine "boo hoo, I didn't objectify/gawk at a bunch of strangers!" or that I deserve "nice guy" points. It just becomes really awkward when you get conscious of how there are some people you really want to look at people but know the decent thing would be to not. 

I should go later when the place is cleared out.  




 Thoughtcatalog: The site that's maybe 1% better than Buzzfeed, tops.  




 Oh, it's just a rock farm? I somehow got the impression there was a joke that it was an organic rock farm.  




 Of course I'm biased, but I honestly think I would have preferred all the final designs to most of Faust's original ones, even if I'd been introduced to hers first.  









 Since jewelry=being able to become invisible or invincible, that sounds about right. 

Besides, Game of Thrones is about fighting for headpieces and furniture.  




 I think it was funnier when for Hot Fuzz he imitated Michael Caine. It was a bit more natural.  




 Crap, I got a lunch-being-by-ants cutie mark.  




 Well, thank you, but it seems odd to have someone believe in me when I'm just going to a safe place to do repetitive tasks and then sitting in a hot tub.  




 I recently learned of the graphically updated Resident Evil game. I know that since then zombies and stuff have become a bit passe and its odd, static third person camera angles clash a bit with modern standards, but to me it still worked really well. Plus I'm sure many of you know about this but I thought the little tweaks to change player expectations on when and how certain actions would happen worked.

So what other games is this being done with? Is Alone in the Dark   supposed to be rumored to be getting anything like this or that sort of thing?  




 Constantly. I have a very small scar on my wrist from when I started cutting myself once. I was cutting "morgue" style too.  









 Yeah, I'm literally going to go get a gym membership in about half an hour. It's going to feel terrible and great at the same time.  




 I am so fucking sold on this.  




 Well, cold anyway.  




 I've heard some pretty horrible domestic abuse. Consensual sex noises  are sweet music compared to that.   














 It means "very softcore porn." Like women in their underwear, bikinis, etc.  




 That's it alright. Thank you.  




 Sounds to me like more trouble than it's worth. 




 And here comes hundreds of thousands of cookies and other treats easily eatable by chopsticks to ruin Mattingly's diet.  









 Using the alias Frank Oz.  




 Done and done.  




 I'm pretty sure the q-tips up his nose book was The Tommyknockers.  




 It's a very unfunny movie in my opinion. 

It's just Night of the Living Dead with the audio swapped out with people talking about shitting, how they're gay, how Ben talks like a stereotypical black man, etc. Even if that's your poison, there's lots of short anti-comedy clips put in and it certainly stops being funny well before the movie ends.  




 Wisconsin, moving to Texas soon. I believe neither of those is marijuana friendly.  




 I was watching some documentary about Incels awhile ago (I have completely forgotten the title and it's too late to look it up now) and at one point someone says Incels have never seen a vagina so they only look at cheesecake porn. Then there's a montage of incel guys being disgusted by porn. 

They're just hamming it up, right? Even as a preteen, I saw a vagina in a magazine once and I found it mildly unpleasant but I certainly didn't retch and turn away the way a bunch of the guys in the movie did.  




 And then someone dialed the number while getting out their gun. 




 I have never smoked or been in close proximity to someone who was smoking marijuana that I'm aware of. I have heard numerous times that certain movies are better on weed. I've heard this said about all sorts of comedies, nature documentaries, art films, etc. How does it improve the experience? 

I frankly don't know how to acquire weed and even if I did I'd be too nervous to get it, so it's not really on the table for me to find out first hand. 

 




 Is that a common thing that gets heavily moderated? Are there 4chan raids? I know I've seen a handful of people daring people to convince them not to kill themselves, but I don't recall off the top of my head anyone being told to do that.  




 I never enjoyed parties in the slightest. I ranted before about how drinking and being drunk did fuck all to help me feel better and other than that it was just people standing or sitting around chatting. If there was live entertainment than it was people standing or sitting around yelling. I don't think they begin to live up to the hype.  




 Okay, fine, I don't like those movies. 

Leave the money on my nightstand.  




 Because they know you're likely to not feel secure enough to treat them badly back?  





























 Was this under "Medical?" 




 Back when he was just starting to look creepy.  




 I haven't since I no longer had any overdue payments.  









 So did RedLetterMedia shit this meme into the world or were they just riding a bandwagon?  














 I know a couple guys who'd I'd collaborated on a few projects with online  and they just had children. I know they should be the ones worrying about me as the alone fetishist aged virgin, but I know at least one of them is struggling with his choice profession and Jesus are kids ever  expensive, time-consuming, and very often a hardship that could very easily lead to a tragic end. 

Of course part of this worrying might be a contributor to my FA status.  




 You have no fucking rights. We made em up. Like the Boogey Man.

 Going around accidentally dropping furniture on dragons.  




 These terrible franchises are crossbreeding? Okay.  




 What are there for nominees?  




 You're pissed that even with all your alt accounts being used to upvote it this thread isn't doing too well on /r/movies, aren't you?  




 These cartoons always seemed to me like a weird combination of trying too hard and being half-assed. 




 "Watch out, Twily! She's Irish!"  




 All these moments will be lost in time. Like sisters in the rain.  









 I have really tried. I've had beer, wine, liquor, schnapps, even moonshine and it all tasted fucking horrible. Just painful to drink. And I didn't experience any euphoria, I just felt queasy and had a headache when I forced down enough that I should have been drunk. I sure as fuck didn't feel any more confident or like I could pick up a prostitute on the stuff let alone like someone with the least bit of game. 

Maybe it's psychological since I had a violent drunk dad, but whatever. It has nothing to do with thinking I'm a "special snowflake" as I'm sure someone would have accused me of for hating alcohol.  
I'm also not offering this up as an excuse for why I'm an aged virgin, but I'm sure also it doesn't help.  




 I'm renewing my gym membership on Monday because they're running a special! It's happening, it's happening! 




 My mother doesn't seem to mind. Ever since dad died a year and a half ago and I moved in with her, she's made no attempt to date or anything, so my being around prevents her from being pretty much FA too.  




 Maybe I should hire a prostitute there just to say I did it, but I'm sure if anyone knew they'd tell me that doesn't count.  




 I only read the comic instead of watching the movie so someone please tell me: Is he invincible and perfect in the movie too? Because that eventually made the book feel lazy, boring, and pretentious to me.  









 Bit of a downer though, and who needs those on this subreddit?  




 Because Cracked doesn't care about reader feedback as long as they gets clicks. 

The fact seemingly anyone could write the ATB articles which get views because they rely solely on mentioning celebrities seems to be irrelevant.  




 Do you do coloring, texture work, tweening, or what? 

Also, are those separate departments?  




 Please tell me to get over my phobias so that I can get over all my phobias.  




 The year of this story? 2016!!!!!!!!!! 




 Blue Ruin. I know a lot of people find it boring, but there was something about what an awkward revenge movie it was that was captivating.  









 "Can you expand on this"

Nice subtle pun. 

Anyway, for me, it's cartoons being literally hooked up to pumps, air tanks, whatever, and floating or bouncing around. As ridiculous as it might sound, characters being drawn becoming fat does nothing for me. 

Obviously this is impossible in the real world and when people photoshop it happening to real humans, I personally find it unpleasant but I don't really begrudge them for it.
