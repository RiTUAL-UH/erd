 I want an AR Pokemon Snap for the 3DS. It could be so cool! 




 *cries* 




 I didn't think about making backups! Awesome. 




 I am not a good enough person to loan out my Pokemon games lol. But I do like the idea of a game card for it. 




 Ooh the PokeBank looks cool! I'm definitely going to have to check that out! Thank you for such an indepth answer :) 




 I'm leaning towards the new 3DS since it has better everything compared to the other models you can get new, although the colors don't excite me. :/

I think I am gonna go for Pokemon Y to start with although I eventually want Alpha Sapphire too.

Are there any bundles I should look for? Is it better to get the cartridge or download the game digitally? [I would cry if my pokes became corrupted]

Also, how easy is it for me to send mons from Diamond or HG or Black?

Thanks y'all! 




 I spent less than half that on two degrees. I suggest you find a less expensive college or get some scholarships. 




 Girls like that go to football games too. No really, I LOVE having your shrieks permanently damage my hearing. I'm sorry you feel threatened by the fact that my big muscly boyfriend is wearing the other team's shirt. 




 Those are tiny! :O 




 Why thank you. :)

Yes the garland is NC, it is from the first festival of neggs iirc.

Soo cute! I love how they are hiding in the flowers. :D 




 Aww thanks! :3 




 Aww congrats! :) 




 Yeah that does sound complimentary. The difference for me was that my minor was required to graduate and therefore took no additional time since I worked on it at the same time as my major classes. 




 Thank you :3 




 Well, my minor was very complimentary to my major and has resulted in making me stand out in the job market because of that additional skillset. 




 Thanks! She is wearing the Dark Faerie Eye Shadow. It was a random prize during the Faerie Quest event recently. 




 I feel like your Draik would make an awesome meal from the fruits of her garden. :) 




 Aww he looks so dapper! :) 









 I had one that I bought in the US and it had Japanese characters too so IDK if that means much. 




 My period always makes me ravenous.
 




 Yes! That describes my booty exactly lol. Do iiiiiiit! 




 I think it has been breaking my flash in Google Chrome (I'm on a PC). 




 Jadzia is my favorite Dax. 3

 OK now I feel old. *cries*

Love those games... 




 I broke my tailbone when I was younger, and it healed at a bit of a different angle. That combined with the fact that there is not much junk in my trunk means that when I sit on my boyfriend's lap wrong, he is jabbed by my coccyx.


He calls it my ass dagger. 




 I would play this. It would probably be the straw that finally made me break down and buy a 3DS. 




 That's pretty low. :/ It's not up to him what you look like, only up to you!

I'd suggest getting single serving stuff or focusing more on veggies and things he can't sneak sugar into. Also, the best diet tip is drink nothing but water so it would be pretty hard for him to sabotage that. :) 




 Had to google fupa... kinda wish I didn't. ;_; 




 I would just ASPLODE if I got to meet Anna and Elsa at Akershus! 3 We have dinner reservations in May so PLEASEEEEE Disney! 




 Sure go ahead. 




 Do y'all do anything with Star Trek Online as an RP vehicle? My fleet RPs with the in game chat, but it's kinda flaky so my boyfriend and I have been exploring other options. 




 No, not at all. Good luck OP. :) (and yes he is amazing!) 




 I've been attacked by someone I trusted. The only person I have told (until now I suppose!) is my future husband, because I wanted to make sure he didn't feel hurt if I had to pull away during intimate moments that became overwhelming. I told him I had something important to tell him. I cried. He held me. I felt better. 




 My ideas are checking your paystubs with your employer or looking at all the deposits into your bank account. I do not know if this will work for your particular situation, but it is where I would start if it was me. Good luck OP that sounds really scary. ;_; 




 So does that spoon come in a cereal box or what? How do acquire? :D 




 You need to decline Delina's quest by clicking the X. 




 I did not read the article because the authors failed to differentiate between biological sex (the word female) and gender (the word man) in the first paragraph and it made me a sad science panda.

 




 Fair enough. 




 ^That's ^what ^analgesic ^means. 




 He could chew on the cane and acquire nutrients. Also it provided a natural analgesic. 




 Yoda's cane (gimer stick) was also nutritional.

EDIT- Denis Lawson is Ewan McGregor's Uncle.

I LOL'd. 




 Thanks! :) 




 It sounds like your family could use some happy news. It sounds tough, but happy things like weddings usually lift everyone up. *hugs OP* 









 I am super impressed! :D I thought it was an actual service Lego offered. 




 Anybody hear anything about Space Mountain refurb in April/May? Folks on a different page have reported fast pass cancellation. 




 Aww thanks. :) 




 Probably. I was trying to say that without directly accusing the OP of being abusive. 




 Her name is Treek and she is in the Cartel Market and is a tank/healer. You can use her for any class either Imperial or Republic. Kind of pricey if you don't catch a sale though. But it's totally awesome she swoops into battle on one of those little hang gliders, summons bees as a taunt, and stabs herself in the leg with a healing dart when her health is low.  




 It sucks dude but it is absolutely her decision to make. Chalk it up to a life experience and apply these lessons to your next relationship. 




 Thank you. Leia was a badass.
