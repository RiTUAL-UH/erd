 AFTER FURTHER REVIEW OF GORDON'S WIN LAST WEEK NASCAR HAS MANDATED THAT HE GIVE HIS PIT CREW OVER TO THE 48 TEAM TO FINISH THE YEAR. 









 Hot dog on bread with peanut butter!  Learned it from my dad when I was younger. 









 No worries.  I know you're just doing what you can on here. 




 Does anyone else read insanity wolf memes in a deep, loud yelling voice? 




 Looks like Team Hendrick has some competition in the give away department. 




 Doc Brown's facial expresion fits perfectly for this! 




 There one guy that jogs on the same trail as me some times and gives high fives all the time.  Always helps out the run for some reason. 




 HE'S GOT NOTHING ON [VICKERS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuegYl4DhRg) 




 DANICA HAS A WAYS TO GO TO GET UP TO 143 RACES WITHOUT A WIN.  BUT JR SHOWED US IT'S POSSIBLE. 




 THAT'S A LOT OF ROOM TO CHEAT! 




 I was there for the spring race and parked directly north of the track on the north side of Clover road and it was free.  Drive time in was about 45 minutes for the last 2 miles coming from the north.  As for leaving we tailgated a bit and left about 2 hours after the race and there was pretty much no traffic. 




 I BET TONY STEWART USES THE SAME BROKEN LEG EXCUSE AGAIN THIS WEEK TO GET OUT OF RACING.  WE ALL KNOW IT'S A COVER UP FOR HIS LACK OF RACING TALENT. 




 CHEATER KNAUS WILL HAVE SOMETHING NEW UP HIS SLEEVE! 




 Well, at least she's *happy* doing what she does now. 




 You're welcome!  And thanks for all you do on this site! 









 Never owned a Naomad myself, but I did get to try one when I used to work at a game store and someone traded one in.  Definitely enjoyed messing around with it. 




 It's still surprising that neither of these systems took off better than they did.  I thought they were both better than the Nintendo handhelds that were out during their respective times. 




 Can't say I have a bet where we pay up each week like yours, but that would be fun.  But I have probably 8 different NASCAR bets with friends that run throughout the course of the year.  Overall it's looking like I should get around $120 and about 2 cases of beer from the winnings. 




 As tsr6 stated, the money now goes to the NASCAR foundation.  Before 2008 the money was redistributed amongst the teams with the season end winnings.  I'm not sure how they decided on redistribution amounts, but I know each team didn't just receive what they paid in during the season.  Otherwise there is no reason to charge them to begin with. 




 I would agree if it's something like a fight that earned the fine, then the individual would most likely have to pay it on their own. 




 I agree that there definitely isn't a catch all answer for something like this.  But thought depending on what the situation was for the fine maybe there is a precedant that teams usually use for if they would compensate the driver'crew chief back.  Of course, as you mentioned, there are different variables that could play into this too. 




 I second the weekly give away!  Considering I forgot about my cake day over the weekend :( 




 I understand that when a team is caught cheating that either the driver or crew chief are usually fined and responsible for paying the fine themselves.  But do the team owners end up essentially "reimbursing" them for the fines after it's paid? 




 If at a social event when you finish your beer/beverage just say you have to go get another one.  Usually works pretty good. 




 So during the race today my brother thought of something in regards to NASCAR's new rule that drivers give 100% effort all the time.  With the restrictor plate race some drivers say that their plan is to stay in the back until the end of the race.  By doing this aren't they actually giving less than 100% effort to try to win the race?  So shouldn't that driver get a penalty for doing this?  Just curious what your thoughts are about this. 




 So should the site now be called Goldit? 




 On tv you don't really see how much they hit off of each other while driving that fast.  You can definitely see it in this video before the wreck. 




 For example, if there's a street with a speed limit of 35 mph, but normal traffic flow is 40+ mph, does it catch your eye when someone is actually driving the speed limit?  And to add to this, would the time of day make a difference, such as mid afternoon compared to 1 am? 




 I'd definitely give one a try.  Just like the funnel baconator at Charlotte Motor Speedway.  That thing was amazing! 




 I agree.  In past seasons when he did hang out in the back it seemed like it almost never worked out for Jimmie.  This year he's actually been running in the front of the pack and it shows with the results since you're less likely to be caught up in a big one if you're in the front. 









 I think Allmendinger is scheduled for one of the remaining races with JTG, but the rest should have Labonte. 




 I'm at work right now too....in Columbus, Ohio. 




 If only they still made multiplayer games with split screen. 




 He HAD backward legs?  So they're corrected now? 




 Hi Chad, you're doing a great job with the team!  I'm looking forward to you winning that 6th championship this year!  In regards to the 48 team haters referring to you as a cheater.  Do you despise them calling you that, or does it make you stronger inside and want to win more just to show them who's boss? 




 Yeah, I'd imagine that would be a bitch to try and crack the cubes once frozen.  When I was growing up we had the single ones, and I recall having to run some water across it sometimes to loosen it up in order to open. 




 So you want one of [these](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en site=imghp tbm=isch source=hp biw=1440 bih=738 q=old+metal+ice+cube+trays oq=old+metal+ice+cub gs_l=img.3.0.0.1981.4976.0.6126.17.10.0.7.7.0.117.936.3j6.9.0....0...1ac.1.27.img..1.16.991.HsBHFRghg4U) old school ice cube trays? 




 How about tacos....that shit ice cream? 




 Was this town festival in northwest ohio by any chance? 




 I'm a JJ fan and I have a brother who's a Hamlin fan and another who cheers for both Biffle and Keselowski.  So needless to say, there's plenty fo smack talk between us.  Especially when we go to a race together. 




 I was a Rusty Wallace fan previously, but became a Jimmie fan back in 2003.  Basically I knew Rusty wouldn't be racing too much longer and Jimmie just caught my eye.  So I had 2 drivers for a while there.  As for giving up on Hamlin, I don't see why someone that's actually a fan of his would give up so easily.  He'll be back and contending for the Chase/Championship next year. 




 I was expecting to at least see the Big Lebowski on the list. 




 I don't like the elimination idea because if someone has problems out of their control, like and engine failure, in the first race they are screwed from the beginning.  They can go on to win 6 of the remaining Chase races and it won't matter because they were already elimited from something out of their control.  Besides, with the points structure there's already an elimination factor with the Chase.  It just takes several races to get into it. 




 So how many coats of paint are on the side of that building by now? 









 Articles I've read estimate this year's attendance at just 75,000 though.  That's fairly low for almost any track on the circuit. 




 Yeah, that could make sense.  They definitely don't go into much detail about how it got there.  But throughout the movie you realize that Tim Robbins has a good amount of connections he uses for help. 




 So I just watched Arlington Road for the first time last night.  Overall I enjoyed the movie and think I understand pretty much everything that happened.  I just have 1 question though.  At the end of the movie, how does the bomb get into the trunk of Jeff Bridges rental car?  Did Tim Robbins know which car he was going to get and had it planted in the trunk beforehand?  Because I believe the only scene where Jeff Bridges isn't in the car is when he's fighting Tim Robbins in the warehouse building.  But I doubt that would have been when they planted it in the car. 




 The standard small talk question "How's it going?"  You really can't say anything aside from "good" unless you want to have a conversation about something being wrong.  Even if there is nothing wrong at the moment. 




 but I can recite the landline numbers of my best childhood friends *parents* 




 Regarding the cooler, do a google search for pocono raceway cooler sizes to get the exact measurements.  Most tracks are around 14 inch cube or so, and a lot only allow soft sided coolers.  A few still allow hard sided ones though.  Along with carrying in a cooler, most allow a clear plastic bag to bring other items in with you. 




 Yup.  On Jayski they posted that only 7 races will be on NBC and the other 13 will be on NBCSN. 









 Labamba's is where it's at for a good burrito! 




 Don't forget to hold the Y button the whole time too while going through the level.  We all know it helps too. 




 While I see your point, there's also a reson for buying a vowel in the case of the word "the".  If there are a lot of other letters missing on the board and you're not really sure of what to guess, then buying an "E" is a way to keep your turn along with seeing if there are other "E's" on the board to help on your next spin. 




 Wow, thanks!  That will definitely make it easier to navigate through and compile! 




 Yeah, that's pretty much the information I was looking for.  Probably be pretty tough to find a site that has penalties bad further than 2001.  Thanks for the help though! 




 I am essentially looking for a website that tracks the penalties that different drivers/teams receive over their career.  More along the lines of points penalites handed out for inspection failure, and not in race penalties where they might have to do a drive through pit lane.  If it does happen to have both stats, then that's even better.  Searching online so far hasn't been much help. 




 Yup, here's the [article](http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/06/28/james-finch-to-sell-sprint-cup-nationwide-team.html) I'm talking about it.  So we'll find out who the buyer is in a few weeks. 




 That's true, but isn't there someone buying the team from James Finch?  So it may just be switching hands essentially. 




 And I thought I was bad for taking the codes out of used games at a store.  But I never take from the new games.  That'd just be wrong. 




 You have 6th graders who have students of their own?
