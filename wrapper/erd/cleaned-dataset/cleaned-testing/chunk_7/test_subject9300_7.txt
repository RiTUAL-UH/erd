 I am currently building my PC (most of my parts havent arrived yet). I got my monitor and I used an HDMI cable to attach it to my xbox 360 in order to test it out. The xbox graphics and display just looks horrendous on the monitor but it looks fine on my tv... Should I be worried about how it will look when im using my PC.
