 Kids, this is the story of how I met your mother.  




 Well, unfortunately, that's the way life is. I know several people who lost considerable amounts of weight, became 'attractive,' and noticed how much nicer people of both genders were to them. It's sad but true.  




 I always included hygiene, clothing, and most importantly *personality* in my definition of attractive - don't you? 




 Why? Honest question, as it applies to both genders.  




 I think most men have much lower standards for at least a one night stand than most women.  




 You do? When does that kick in? 




 I saw a paper a while back that said thirty minutes of fairly active (not missionary) sex a day was enough exercise for an adult to maintain weight on a reasonably healthy diet. 




 I think part of the issue should be that, in many countries, any 17yo having sex with a 15yo is statutory rape, regardless of consent given by both parties.  




 It's not so much underdressing as ridiculous overdressing that irritates me. 




 I think that firstly, there should be a difference between promiscuity and genuinely being a *slut*, and that some criticism of proper sluts has some justification - but most importantly, should applied to MEN AS WELL.

It's fine with me for a person (regardless of gender) to go out and have a one night stand. I'm fine with two or maybe three different partners a week. Sex is great and should be encouraged. But someone who has sex with a different partner *every single day* (casually, not as a job etc) or even multiple partners in one twenty-four hour period (and I know girls who do this) are going a bit far. 

There are obvious reasons like the ridiculous risk of STDs with that many partners - protection isn't foolproof and you're vastly increasing your statistical chances - but, and this is probably where people will disagree, I think that having sex with *that many* different partners reduces the value of the emotional connection inherent in the act, and sex goes from positive to degrading. 

And I think some 'slut shaming' of men is fairly obvious - if women don't like being sexually objectified (and who would) and the way that affects them in society, then stop treating every one of them like an achievement, and your life like you have a pokedex of vaginas you need to complete. In short: men shouldn't be congratulated for having sex just because they were 'able' to get in a woman's pants. 

Details: I'm a white, 19yo atheist male from outside of the US, who was not brought up in a strongly religious home.  




 I think it would be their combined incomes that would drop the panties. 

There's be billions just from the movie stars alone.  




 Well, let's think about it. You're displaying attraction to her, being confident, showing your sexual intention, and implying that you know in great detail *exactly* what women are attracted to. 




 Who said Samurai give good advice?

Last time I checked Feudal Japanese marriages were arranged, so there's no reason to expect him to be a seduction expert.  




 TL;DR of this article: Kino builds comfort 




 until you've built enough comfort

So you need to build comfort in order to use a technique that builds comfort? Totally sounds like a non-redundant strategy.  




 I said 'about five.' I'd meant it to be a rough indication.  




 *slow clap* 




 It was 145 over 139. 




 It does happen, though. (Without bragging, for the purposes of the discussion, as it doesn't necessarily mean that we're actually intelligent) both myself and my ex have very high IQs, but hers was about five points higher than mine, and because she was doing a science degree and I a music degree it led to competition, comparison, jealousy and bitterness on my behalf, and some considerable condescension on hers. It was a major factor in our breakup.  




 Answers to the first two would be great. And how to counter any potential resistance.  




 Playing badly 




 Explain? 




 I'm reading The Game at the moment, is it good/worth following in terms of self improvement? I'm not sure if I agree with things like peacocking.  




 It's like he's never been tickled before 




 Wow. You must be pretty hot for someone to genuinely compliment you after paying yourself out. That doesn't usually happen.  




 Also prepared to reach ultimate friendzone level: the shoulder she cries on about how much of a dick guys are to her while ignoring you as an option.

(I say this with the intent of being critical of guys who complain about the friendzone, not as a 'nice guy')

 




 Am I the only one who thinks it's a dick move to break up any relationship, no matter the 'level of seriousness?'

Sure, I could probably steal stuff from a lot of shops. It shows I'm 'better' than the shop owner because he's not protecting his 'merchandise' effectively enough. So if I'm good enough to get hold of it then maybe I deserve it more than him. Doesn't change the fact that stealing is wrong.  




 At least you get compliments. 90% of men don't.  




 Colby. Never forget 




 Just FYI, the greater majority of /r/seduction frowns upon 'negging' (basically backhanded compliments) and most things that involve destroying someone's self esteem to complement your own.  




 Conspiracy Keanu 




 That's actually a really interesting thought. I'm doing my very best to show love and affection for you - why do you think you can reject that just because it's not in the specific manner that you want? It's quite ungrateful.  




 Only a Sith deals in absolutes.  




 Spray it with lemon water if it disobeys.

 Blowjob for every mark above 70%.

What have you done?! The White Walkers are coming! 




 Much less awkward than asking someone the time in this age of phones.  




 How is that AFC? An opener is an opener. And he clearly did something right, because she was his girlfriend.  




 Other countries - such as the Netherlands - have all of these things, as well as universal healthcare.  




 What has the US actually accomplished, besides fighting a lot of wars and making a small group of people very rich? 




 Makes me suspicious tbh. This story is a little too perfect.

 Your name is proof enough for me 




 It's well-established that what women *think* they want and what they *actually* want are seldom the same thing.

Example: wanting men to open up emotionally in relationships. They think they want to hear about all your insecurities etc. But now you've lost all of the self-confidence that made you attractive to her in the first place, and before you know it, she's cheating on you or dumping you for someone else.  




 Almost tempted to fly down from Brisbane. If the weather is lower than 36, I'm sold.  




 /r/askwomen is unfortunately a brilliant example of a larger male population upcoming what they want to hear.  




 I think you're onto something there. There is definitely a correlation between the common opinion of a subreddit and its general demographic - for example, /r/sex features a LOT of very sex-positive women. This is great, but it provides a slightly biased view of women the world over (IMO), because someone who is ashamed of religiously disposed against their sexuality won't exactly be posting about it on the Internet.  




 I understand this. There's no need to be aggressive. However I, as a male, in /r/askmen, in a thread about what males find attractive, think I can question what my fellow gender thinks to further that discussion.  




 Is this because you're so used to men in /r/askwomen asking about attractive features, what signs indicate they like someone etc? 




 how can I love someone who doesn't love themselves

Ok, what is seriously wrong with loving someone who has low self esteem? I see this constantly.  




 snipers and shotguns

These are not actual firearms, right... 




 Can I tentatively suggest that, due to the fact that men are (let's face it) generally emotionally repressed in our society, the Internet and these subreddits might be the only place where they feel comfortable talking about their emotions? 




 You have a great point. If you ask women what they find attractive, and it isn't you, is that really their fault? It ties into the idea that the most upvoted response in either subreddit is usually the one that pleases the males the most. 

I say this as an unattractive and unconfident male who feels worse when reading these types of threads - but I wouldn't expect anyone to change them just to suit my fantasies.  




 Or "I already know what I want to do, please tell me that I'm right" 




 You're welcome. Now go get some.  




 Can you link me to a description/how-to of the 5 questions game? 




 You need to tell her everything you just said about not being old enough and not being ready, and above all, about *not wanting to be romantically involved with her in any way again.*

Do not, under any circumstances, have sex with her or be physical with her in any way. If she says it's casual, trust me, it's not. You will only hurt her more.  




 I can't do this

- Confidence in your own abilities and *knowing your limits and inabilities* - the difference between ego and self confidence.  




 /r/confidence, /r/faimprovement and even /r/seduction may help you out.  




 tongue was implied

Well maybe it's not. That's what you've learned from this night, and your routine will be better for it. You've improved. That's a successful outcome.  




 If you were actually an alpha you wouldn't be so dependent on sex to make you happy.  




 This is pretty well known. I'd say he means girls who can.  




 Can we have a 'dear ladies' and 'dear men' insecurities thread, sidebar it, and make it essential reading before posting? I feel this is an even better format of FAQ.   




 This article has no information and a lot of links to 'my website.'
