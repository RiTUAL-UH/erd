 Please explain. What did he imply? That the illegals are mostly bad people? I think your right. He said the wrong thing, but people are taking this far. It's Donald Trump and he said something stupid. I don't think he hates Mexicans though. Just possibly overreacting and exaggerating about the border problems.
