 my boyfriend tells me to keep not talking to my dad. i have told my boyfriend more stuff about my sister and agrees that she is a nasty piece of work. I've always felt like the outsider but that could be because i also have bpd.  




 thank you for calling me a sweet sweet woman  




 when i did see my dad the most recent i would just be silent and not talk and be like that for hours and it would be easier because i would try to talk and he would call me stupid for asking a question. or my sister would tell me to shut up because i said the wrong thing in front of our dad. so i just got sick of it and removed myself from it by not going and not talking to him.  




 im worried that if i talk to my dad even once it will go back to the way it was and ill have no life. he doesn't even know I'm bisexual and he doesn't even know I'm going to get tattoos done soon. so it seems easier to ignore him.  




 i did a bachelors in photography but i got an ordinary degree  




 i am currently on esa which is a disability benefit.  




 i didn't get a job out of uni because i was suffering with severe depression and still am. i am also ill and in and out of hospital and doctors. i don't have a job. when i am not too ill i get job interviews but never a job. i moved in with my current boyfriend but he couldn't look after me all the time and it was a strain on him.  




 my sister and my mum attack each and i don't know what to do. my new bf has met my sister brother and mum but i don't want him to meet my dad. i have tried to block his number using an app but I'm not sure if it blocks texts.  




 I'm going to have a talk with my mum because she has a rocky relationship with her dad as well. my granddad hit my mum with a walking frame but they still manage to talk still.  




 i also get a lot of hate from my sister about it
