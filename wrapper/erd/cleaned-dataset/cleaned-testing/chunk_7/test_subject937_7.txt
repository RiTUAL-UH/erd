 Nothing new for a President to do. Your hyperbole is just that. 




 Sorry for the delay, but here's a good place to start:

 No, stop with _your_ nonsense. Executive Agreements have the force of law, and are treaties on the international level.

Treaties ratified pursuant to the Treaty Clause are not the only legal treaties in the U.S.

 Hey! I was there, too! We're "almost died" brothers...

Bullets hit about 10 feet from my head. 




 That was a memory slap. 




 I have a Rome trip planned for Dec. 2018. Way too soon to hope for a cheaper vacation, isn't it? 









 Holy crap, beer?! 




 And thus begins the legal cascade that can royally fuck someone's life if they don't comply perfectly. All because of a bullshit charge. 




 Only treaties made pursuant to the Treaty Clause. Senators alone have no say in executive agreements. 




 The top moves to the side at the end. Pulling out? 




 Start with Edgar's Grille. It is a restaurant owned by Goodwill. They are LGBT friendly (have hosted a few events for Augusta Pride).

If they have nothing, I think they will be able to help. It's somewhat of a unique business since it is owned by Goodwill. 




 I'll make your list when you got to law school.

The President is the executive pursuant to the Constitution, and therefore has authority over foreign policy. Exceptions to this such as Senatorial consent are just that: exceptions.

Asserting that the President is a figurehead in foreign policy is the height of constitutional ignorance. 




 It is debatable actually. The Treaty Clause is not the _exclusive_ means by which the U.S. can enter into treaties. 




 The President is a figurehead when it comes to foreign policy? Are you joking? 




 Understanding the Constitution requires more than merely reading it. There are centuries of practice and case law.

For example, there are 3 types of treaties, not just 1.  The President can enter into an executive agreement and on the international stage, it is just as much a treaty as one ratified by 2/3s of the Senate.

Also, it's undeniable that the President is in charge of negotiating foreign policy. I agree what they did wasn't treason, but it was highly inappropriate and they should be publicly shamed. Senators get to weigh in on foreign affairs in various ways. This is not one of them. 




 Free speech (as commonly understood in the U.S.) is a concept between a citizen and a government. If there is no government involvement, there is no violation of free speech. 




  just read the comments made by the attorneys involved and it sounds like they are genuinely afraid of science or intelligence

The attorney isn't scientifically ignorant. He is just attacking the prosecution's case in whatever ways he can. 




 A video of this using a nuclear bomb _would_ be pretty fucking cool. 




 Surely everyone has seen a picture of the ocean though. And according to O'Reilly's Law, that is equivalent. 




 Haha, no. I would never email a racist joke at work. Quit trying to act like that is normal behavior.

And I think the statement is pretty clear. He emailed a racist joke at work.

Does that make him a racist? Not necessarily - the other option I gave is that he's a moron. But I would tend to think the former over the latter. 




 Um, the Moto 360 has been out for almost a year. No one knows mine is a smartwatch. 




 Sharing a racist joke via email to your work colleagues is not the same thing as finding an offensive joke funny.

If you do such a thing, you're either (a) a fucking moron or (b) a pretty hardcore racist. 




 Is this even possible? 




 Well... in 2,000 years their names will be just as historic. 




 This particular one is a case of top-down marching orders. It was surreal to see...

There had been no opinion on the issue _at all_ and then all the sudden: OBAMACARE FOR THE INTERNET.

The editorial staff doesn't understand the issue but willingly regurgitates the anti-net neutrality talking points. 




 One of these is my local paper, and the editorial staff is _insanely_ right wing (as is the cartoonist).

I have little doubt these are political. 




 Can you articulate specifics? As it stands, your comment is too vague to be anything but meaningless. 




 Source? No other gay group did any work to repeal DADT? 




 We are too rare to be so god damn stupid. 




 Misleading title.

The legislation passed the _Senate_, meaning it still must pass the House and be signed by the Governor.

If you don't want it to be legal to discriminate in GA, call your GA House Representative ASAP. The companion bill is still in committee.

They don't hear from many people so your opinion _will_ have a meaningful impact. 




 Then let your GA House Representative know that the legislation shouldn't move forward. It's in committee and can most easily be stopped there.

Don't let these folks do actual damage to people for naked political gain. 




 Article about the former Attorney General in the NYTimes:

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/us/gay-rights-groups-find-unlikely-ally-in-georgia-fight.html?_r=0 




 According to the former Attorney General, yes (op-ed in today's AJC).  




 Sen. McKoon from Columbus is the primary supporter. He may have something out there. 




 This isn't /r/news. But there's a legal memo by the former GA Attorney General if you'd like to read it. The memo explains how the bill will cause problems.

His name is Michael Bowers. I can find it for you but it's easily found online.

Edit: Here it is: http://documents.buzzfeed.com/BowersMemo.pdf

 Short version: if the government tries to prevent discrimination, religion can be used as a defense.

As long as the religious belief is sincerely held, it can be used to circumvent civil rights protections (such as serving gays).

Edit: Here's a memo from a former GA Attorney General explaining why the bill is a bad idea: http://documents.buzzfeed.com/BowersMemo.pdf 




 I am having a hard time accepting the claim that the flurry of new "religious freedom" bills has nothing to do with the pending gay marriage ruling. 




 Practical limitations aside, is this actually theoretically possible? 














 It passed. 




 Terraserver? 




 Or at least a percentage. Then schools might start doing what all other lenders do: evaluate risk. 




 Possibly, but an across-the-board time limit may be sufficient. 




 Nope. The nondischargeability transfers in such situations. 




 We could put a time element into the discharge for student loans.

10 years from the date of disbursement sounds reasonable to me.

Tax and spend 




 The chosen one. 




 Only if it's patentable (or in some other way prevents copy cats). 




 I was in El Salvador and I saw nuns get shot in the back of the head.

Can you explain to me why this sentence has only one reasonable interpretation (and that interpretation is not "I saw nuns get shot in the back of the head")? 




 That guy that jumps the fence I think just pulled a James Bond end-of-chase scene move. 




 Georgie isn't wrong. A lie is an intentional misrepresentation.

 Is "Should I get circumsized?" a common issue for guys who aren't at birth?

Genuinely curious. U.S. male here.

 Clark and Washington?

A few grand for custom "BestCase" is an incredible deal. Do they have any plans to license it? 




 Who would do it, though?

Good government policy assumes each power will pull to its greatest extent. And that doesn't necessarily mean any particular branch is wrong.

Our executive is too weak. Having a mayor who will fight for a stronger balance of power is a good thing in my opinion. 









 Source? 




 I'm not saying "war zone" can't be used figuratively. I'm saying that Bill O'Reilly doesn't seem to have used it figuratively when talking about his past reporting.

And when there is an actual war going on (unlike in Ferguson), it's much more important to be clear about what you mean by "war zone". 




  Bill claimed to be filming in a war zone, but he wasn't stating that it was a literal war zone.

This seems very generous to Bill O'Reilly. He repeatedly used his experience in a "war zone" to bolster his credibility on war reporting.

Every quote I've read has no hint of anything other than a literal interpretation of "war zone".

Edit: This is a good example of what I'm talking about (from the [_Mother Jones_ article](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/02/bill-oreilly-brian-williams-falklands-war)):

In a 2004 column about US soldiers fighting in Iraq, O'Reilly noted, "Having survived a combat situation in Argentina during the Falklands war, I know that life-and-death decisions are made in a flash." 









 Now I need to know what would happen if the Death Star fired upon a star... 




 Option 4 doesn't require any interaction with the grandparents though. I see the merits of Option 1 but I would personally choose Option 4: prove them wrong and racist, and still cut them out. If my spouse has a problem with that, our relationship might not work.

And I don't see what makes cutting contact but keeping the spouse easier with Option 1. 




 It's not the same argument because families aren't for-profit businesses. 




 I support this. Our mayor is too weak - the office may as well not even exist (and governing purely by committee is not efficient). 




 Why is Option 1 better than Option 4? 




 Because "Apple". 




  10-20 years minimum

Probably more like 5-10 years minimum. Technology does not advance linearly (but that is how we tend to view it). 




 I'm having flashbacks to last year...

 I think he's talking about whether the U.S. has an "Ironman" suit. 




 I have no background in graphic design. I like the blue one. 




 Legally, Georgia had some bad precedent on the federal level that delayed the filing of a lawsuit. 




 I really don't see the stretch marks. I think I can see them... but can't be sure. 




 The secretary's response was that I'll need to talk to Principal myself to tell him i'm unavailable.

My response would be: "That's unnecessary and really a waste of his and my time. Please let him know that I'm unavailable to help with the cake. Thanks!" 




 I'm not discussing whether the classes struggle against each other. My interest is in /u/Vayate's claim that because you don't believe in something (e.g., class warfare), you therefore don't engage in it.
 




  47% (at the time, might be more or less now) of the US population pays nothing in federal income tax.

Romney's problem with that comment was going from "doesn't pay federal income taxes" to "dependent upon government, ... believe[s] that they are victims, ... believe[s] the government has a responsibility to care for them, ... believe[s] that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing", and then after all that claiming that "[he'll] never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."

Telling anyone who received a federal tax refund that they do not take personal responsibility and care for their lives is an extremely idiotic thing to do. 




  Republicans don't believe there is conflict between the classes.

Ok. But not believing in something doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It's not enough to say that Republicans don't engage in class warfare because they don't believe it exists. 




  Republicans generally don't engage in class warfare because they reject the Marxist notion that class struggle is central to politics and history.

Are you saying they don't engage in class warfare or don't knowingly engage in class warfare? 




 God he's hot... 




 While acknowledging the harm this is causing same-sex couples in Alabama, I admit to anxiously watching how far this will go.

I don't want this to happen, but if state officials won't back down, I'll enjoy seeing the fallout. 




 ... 




 And by 2016, a large segment of the U.S. will believe that the fees and taxes that have always been there are new and Obama's fault (just like rising healthcare premiums). 




 A local state representative penned a letter to the editor a few weeks ago claiming that advocating for a proposed "religious exemption" bill is a continuation of Dr. King's fight.

It's absurd what they are trying to do. 




 The red mist would descend.

Is this a euphemism for violent rage? 




 For the "first shot", could the torpedoes be loaded in water that reduces wear and tear (e.g., fresh water)? 




 Neither question is relevant to your original assertion. Did the President enact the ACA by himself, yes or no? 




 Pointing out that the ACA was enacted pursuant to the Constitution (approval by both houses and the President) *is* a convincing counter-argument to "Obama is a tyrant because of Obamacare".

If your definition of "tyrant" includes the process by which the ACA was enacted, does that make the U.S. Constitution tyrannical? 




 Obama didn't create the ACA by himself. It was enacted into law pursuant to the Constitution. 




 There is a huge (and significant) difference, but there is also at least one similarity: helping others.

Unless he would send every dollar the government taxes him to help others to charity, his position is weak. 




  I would like to live in a place that has some personality and is not completely indistinguishable from every other suburban cookie cutter neighborhood in the country.

I don't disagree with this but it's a package deal most of the time. We've all seen the pictures of the Great Pyramids from Pizza Hut, and there is a McDonalds seemingly every few miles in Paris.

Simply put, where there is economic activity, chains are going to exist. A restaurant like Chipotle isn't necessarily a good thing to me personally, but I do recognize that it represents a growing local economy.

And that *is* a good thing to me personally. 




 Cuba is really only "untapped" to the U.S. 




 I don't understand what you're expecting. What metro area doesn't have a lot of fast food restaurants? Are you hoping to live in a city with no such restaurants?

Are there any examples of this occurring anywhere? 




 They are not automatically shared with anyone. That requires an extra step from the user. 




 It's an example of how expensive it is to be poor. Another example is Costco. If you can afford to buy in bulk, food is much cheaper. 




 Did he mean _because_ they are black or _because_ they are athletes? 




  Are you seriously advocating for a Cultural Revolution in the US?

Not taking the bait, troll. 




 And a waste of resources (which SCOTUS isn't a big fan of). If they reject marriage equality, the federal judiciary will have thousands of gay marriages to adjudicate the validity of. 




 For you to imply that I cannot use similar language against the enemies of the republic is ignorant at best and hypocritical at worst.

What _precisely_ do you mean by this? Why is it potentially ignorant for /u/Delwin to imply that you cannot use similar language? Why is it potentially hypocritical? 




 Unfortunately, I responded to /u/goodboy before scrolling down to see him tip his hand as a far-right ideologue.

There's a good chance he sides with Alabama and desperately wants to believe the federal government will back down. 




 Just look into what happened when Alabama resisted integration. If push comes to shove, the federal government has a lot more guys with guns than Alabama does. 




 Is it turtles all the way down? 




 U3 *is* pretty at low of 5.6% though (as are U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6). It's only misleading if you start switching between different "U"s.

The measurements all track each other fairly well so referencing any one of them can be a good measure of the *relative* strength of the job market. ([Here's](http://i.imgur.com/tWpxVFu.jpg) what looks to be an accurate chart that shows this.) 




 It's only misleading if you don't read the definition. No one is trying to hide anything from anyone. All the data (U1-U6) is readily available.

And if we shouldn't use U3, that just means that we've had much higher unemployment for decades. 




 U3 has been the official standard worldwide for a long time. Also, all six categories track each other quite well with changes only on the x-axis.

Using U3 is really only misleading if you previously used, say, U6. 




 Climate change and evolution denial are characteristics of the American right. Libruls aren't making them deny science. 




 The behavior of leading GOP figures over the last few days has been baffling. Until this week, anti-vaxxers were thought to be left-wing (holistic, hippie-types).

To see them willfully take the issue and make it their own has been so strange. 




 Holy fuck. The joke about Obama curing cancer and Hannity therefore opposing it might not be that far off... 




 There's really no justification for tyrannical behavior from the bench. Judges are paid to be there and help resolve disputes. They deserve respect but must show it as well. 




 Is the country itself a semicolon? 




 Libel is rarely, if ever, criminal in the U.S. It's a civil matter. 




 Oop, I definitely made that assumption and I apologize. I have zero idea how Croatian bankruptcy will work. 




 This is not correct.  Bankruptcy allows for exemptions which are essentially a dollar figure below which you can keep assets. Most people who file Chapter 7 (liquidation) are well below the exemptions so will not lose any property. 




 I add "@HHMM" when relevant, too (24 hour). 




 Thanks for the source. That will definitely complicate things for her, in my opinion.

Wouldn't there be only one of two possibilities here? (1) He was being detained or (2) he was not being detained (he clearly wasn't under arrest).

If he was being detained, there needs to be reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. What is the reasonable suspicion here? If the police officer does not have reasonable suspicion, he can just walk away. Likewise, if he was not being detained, he can just walk away. And that is even more so the case if the officer is simply taking his picture as a member of the public. Forcing him to stay would be false imprisonment in that situation (and there would be no investigation for her to interfere with).

As for an ongoing criminal investigation, wouldn't he be entitled to access to counsel if that was the case? It's not like this was immediately post-arrest (e.g. mugshot). This was outside of a courtroom after a hearing. 




 Mine arrived today!  




 The right-leaning bias is pretty strong in this comment. 




 Wouldn't they have already taken pictures following the initial arrest? The headline says this was "outside court", which means the arrest was likely many days prior. 




 Whether the cops have a right to take a pic of a suspect when they have reasonable suspicion that thr suspect committed a crime.

If he has a public defender, he was already arrested and already had his picture taken. Are you suggesting that they thought he committed an additional crime during or right after the hearing?
