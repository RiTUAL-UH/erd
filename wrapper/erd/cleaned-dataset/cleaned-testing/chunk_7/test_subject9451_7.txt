 sounds pretty easy, thanks! I'll pick up some tablets tomorrow :) 




 Shit. Well, to be honest I wasn't paying attention to protein at ALL today, only carbs and nothing else. But I'm going to re-calculate because according to MPF, the tacos with lettuce shells I had for dinner came in at 136g of protein. Thanks for the info, I'll be sure to be more careful going forward. 




 Thank you for the info and the support! Today I did pretty good on water, I'm looking into how to more adequately supplement electrolytes. I definitely do not want to feel that flu at work! 




 yes? Unless I put something into MFP very, very wrong. Numbers are:
Goal: 70
Total: 205
Left: -135 




 Awesome, thanks for the response! But I didn't pay any mind to protein at all today. I'm over by 135, is that bad? 




 I'm almost 600 calories over for the day, yet I have 7g of carbs left to consume. Is it a problem if I'm under? How important is it to meet my carbs for the day? Do I need to consume something else to match my daily allotment?

EDIT: I figured out my protein problem!! I did some meal prepping and ate some of that for dinner. I accidentally included *all* of the ground beef I used instead of just what I ate tonight. Thank you all for your input and advice. Without you guys, I wouldn't have given it a second thought otherwise because I'm pretty clueless about nutrition.

EDIT 2: I fixed the info in MFP and while I'm still over for the day because of my lunch (steak and seared shrimp), I'm *so much closer!* 




 4 simultaneous tooth abscesses for about 10 months. I went to the dentist for the first time in my life about a year ago at 26 years old. I got 3 root canals and all 4 wisdom teeth removed, but one of the root canals failed causing another abscess and I got 3 dry sockets from my wisdom teeth at the same time.
The pain was unreal, and no amount narcotics helped. Couldn't eat, drink, sleep, or talk. I never want to feel that again. 









 Thank you so much, you are incredible! I'll let you know how it works 




 I'm using Open Office rather than Excel, could that cause formatting problems? I'm getting Error Code 508 under the"Row" column, and the shopping list doesn't auto-populate, it's all grayed out. 




 No just any tea, try Yerba Mate. It's got 85mg of caffeine per fluid ounce, so it's sure to give you the fix you're looking for! 




 I am so, so sorry you're feeling this way. I did a similar thing the last couple of days. My husband keeps me in check, but he's gone for work and since he's left I've gotten totally out of control. I curse myself while taking another bite of pizza or cookie.
I strongly recommend you check out /r/EOOD/, it's a sub just for people who are in the process of getting physically healthy while fighting mental issues, mainly depression. It's by far my favorite sub, just for the support and understanding. 




 I see it as gold and white, my brain only processes it and black and blue when I don't look directly at the dress but rather at the lower left corner of the photo. 




 Yeah ive gotten that email before. 
"Hi friend, I hope this email finds you well. 
 I'm in Nigeria and am in desperate need of money. If you could help me out I will reward you handsomely." 




 You have just made so much sense out of many years of pain, remorse, confusion, guilt and fear. I went through a very similar situation as the man above, but in at two personal cases the men were between 4 and 6 years older than me and both close relatives. Still, you unknowingly helped so many people like myself. I can't express how much your words have helped me, and if you were infront of me right now I would hug you and cry. Thank you a million times.  




 Considering you're experiencing high anxiety before the gym it's more likely it's tied to that, but if the two events are unrelated it could be exercise - induced asthma.
