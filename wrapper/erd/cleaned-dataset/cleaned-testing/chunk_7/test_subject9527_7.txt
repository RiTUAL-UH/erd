 Same director as those films. A lot of the crew is returning for this too. Pedro Brofman is the composer for this. 




 They chose the right director too. Jose Phadilla of the Elite Squad films.  




 He tried being a lead in tough guy movies and that didn't work out so well. 




 He has jokes for days. DAYS. 




 The century club gang is all there too. 




 Dan owns something called crystal head vodka

 It was nice for 28Dans to do an AMA before the culling of his subreddits.

Maybe he'll finally have time to finally focus on opening a restaurant instead of all that racist garbage.

 No Pieta or The Clone Returns Home. I'm sad these don't get more exposure. But there are some new recommendations in between the stuff we know already. 




 Guess Reddit is in the midst of cutting their brotarian ties with Steve and Alexis. 




 It's not a fallacy, it's a documented reality. We like to think we're immune to tyrannies, but the truth is it takes vigilance, and sometimes over-reaction, in order to prevent them. It's a tug of war, and just because we're winning doesn't mean we can stop tugging - the other side sure won't.

Best of Outrage Culture worthy in that Advice Animals Thread.

The conspiracy Yishan PR machine is apparently waking up in that Technology thread: 

Yishan is bitter Pao was thrown under the bus by Alexis and the board. He recommended her for the post, and I will bet half my karma that they have a personal relationship as well. Now he sees the perfect opportunity to get back at Alexis and the board, with some grade A shit posting. Check out some of his previous comments in the past few days, you'll get the gist. No complaints from me though, makes for some excellent popcorn.

Holy hell, this is some prime cookery:

How is that a 'PR spin machine'? That all seems terrible for reddit the company. This isn't PR spin machine, it's someone who is mad and getting revenge by airing the dirty laundry
Its PR for Yishan's cause. I hope he at least gets some of that pussy from all this white knighting.

Now the Reddit celebrities are chiming in. A famous Lizard of War has appeared:

I'm a bit confused, perhaps you can clarify what you mean:

Reddit caused Ellen's departure (you did it reddit!) but Ellen says it didn't and the board confirms.

 - Ellen was all about free speech and fatpeoplehate was only banned for inciting off-site but dozens of parody subreddits were banned after that did nothing off-site and hundreds of people were shadowbanned for criticizing her? Did she know this was happening?

- With Ellen at the helm, Reddit was immune to being criticized for intentionally creating a racist / sexist environment but Reddit is the users, not the corporate structure. How could Reddit, Inc. be criticized for promoting free speech?

 - This entire time you had vital information that could have saved your friend embarrassment and mental anguish but you didn't say anything because of "Executive Privilege?"

I dunno man, this doesn't make sense to me.

The only way this all works in my head is if Ellen was a figurehead with no actual power, had nothing to do with the contradictory decisions made, and you were under some sort of gag-order.

Maybe this was all a giant cluster-fuck of epic proportions and the lack of communication was the result of internal squabbling, but honestly, I love Reddit and I expect better.

 I think the Kotaku in Action/MRA/Coontown network are going to be in denial about what sub reddits are on the chopping block until it comes true.  




 We've seen what "ignoring the subs" cause. It creates Fat People Hate to grow to its bulbous size and when the admins finally decide they've had enough of them, they boot them from the site causing a tidal wave of thousands of seemingly 20 something adults throwing internet temper tantrums. 

Clearly, ignoring and going about your Redditing experience doesn't work. It just allows large concerted efforts to grow a shitty user base to go unabated and then it seeps into other Sub Reddits. If you want to see the affect of ignoring a problem just look at the /r/videos threads where a woman talks about [domestic abuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3cjgit/26_year_old_woman_from_ireland_posts_video_about/) or [isolated incidents at Wal-Mart.](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3cdhte/walmart_has_the_worst_customers/csuoqq7)

 What was it like working with Joseph Bishara? Can you talk about the process of scoring a movie with him?

 




 "popcorn tastes gud" - Reddit admins. 




 Was there some sort of concerted effort to deny Mark Zuckerberg getting sickening comments from Facebook users with his various updates to private policy? I'd like to see those articles.

About how this young beacon of talent is being unfairly judged and being character assassinated? Yeah didn't think so.

Where? You brought it up. Show me where his character is being assassinated. 




 EDIT: [Shit, your whole post seems silly now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/ct3n7hc)

[Kickme444](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3d2hv3/kn0thing_says_he_was_responsible_for_the_change/ct1fczz) stated on Theory of Reddit that Pao didn't fire Dacvak for Leukemia. And [it's been confirmed that Alexis fired Victoria](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/07/13/former-reddit-ceo-alleges-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-fired-victoria-taylor-not-pao/)

Also, Ellen Pao does not have a board seat. Alexis is still her boss. He was Board chairman and he already admitted to firing Victoria. He just did it in the most sheepish way possible by letting Pao take most of the heat. There are other holes in your essay too. Op-eds are peoples opinions. They are inherently bias. You linked two of them. That's not a sign of media bias. Also, you'd have to prove that there's an end to what the media bias is supposed to achieve here other than "redditors are kinda shitty people."

Secondly, media bias isn't in most of the articles you linked considering most of your linked articles all correctly reported Sam Altman's statements about "sickening" behavior. 

For some reason you brought in this weird men vs women stance while arguing that gender and identity politics don't matter in this case when according to the end statement of your essay, they do?

Finally, Redditors aren't a privileged class of citizen. This is a social media site, we don't get any sort of civil rights here. Most of the decisions alleged to Pao have been refuted by admins and other sources from Reddit. And she did receive an undue amount of shitty behavior from Reddit's user base.  




 Because Reddit has so far had a stellar track record on mob justice...

 The well goes deep. "Sandra Bullock and Halle Berry; Doing Great as Single Moms:"

It is considered a feat to make a marriage work in Hollywood. Celebrity couples due their hectic work schedule, plus the media who constantly poking and over sensationalized a simple circumstance need not to be publicly known and invaded privacy certainly added pressure to the struggling unions of the celebrities and superstars. 

There is an apparent increase of celebrity single parents lists. The most popular alibis are; divorce, new found love, unfortunate passing of their partner and the decision to move forward with becoming a parent in their own right. Recently is Bridget Moynahan, whom Tom Brady left in favor of supermodel Gisele Bundchen. The actress is famous in her role as John Cusack's fiance in the movie Serendipity seems adjusting well to her new solo job a single as mom. 

Sandra Bullock follow through, the actress life-changing year has included an Oscar win, a divorce filing and an adoption. Public was sympathetic to Bullock when news of her cheating husband, Jesse James broke. It is a public knowledge that Jesse James philandering acts prompted Sandra Bullock to file divorce. Sadness was replaced by joy for her elated adoption of her baby boy, Louis Bardo. 

Halle Berry and boyfriend Gabriel Aubrey heading to Splitsville and are now reportedly battling over custody of their daughter, Nahla. The gorgeous actress has a very rocky and public love life. Her recent split from boyfriend Gabriel Aubrey, and father of her daughter, Nahla seemed amicable at first, but there had been a change in the direction of the wind as the two are embroiled in a custody battle. 

Kudos to all single parents, celebrity or not. Your toil deserves great appreciation. And one way of showing is through giving mothers jewelry. There is a wide selection of personalized necklaces and personalized jewelry to choose from. So let your creative juices flow and pick a unique mothers gift. 




 Another gem called How to Become Famous Like Justin Bieber:

Do you want to become famous? And do you want to become famous like Justin Bieber did? **Well what if I was to tell you that it's not actually that hard to do?**

Bieber may be too criticized by many but is a great example of what the marketing, social networking and other elements can do.

First Bieber began releasing their videos through YouTube, a platform that has given 5 minutes of fame to many people, but these 5 minutes stretched into years due to other internet tools... Twitter.

If we learn from the biography of Justin Bieber is that if someone wants to become famous, should begin now to put their videos (as real as possible) on YouTube, because you never know who might "accidentally" discover your talent for delight the young fans. 

This is exactly what has happened to Justin Bieber.

Twitter really help Bieber began to attract attention from your target market. Many marketers still do not understand the scope that is Twitter users and yet this was the platform that Justin used to engage with your audience. Justin currently offer your movie called "Never Say Never" (never say never), a type of documentary which presents the story of the singer and how he came to where he is now.

And of course had to take a perfume especially for girls called "someday" but the video is a little weird and may even get you a laugh, in two days has reached the 2 million views. A very good example is Google; that is starting to become obsessed with the pop stars. This search engine company has made a change in its marketing strategy. Last month, he joined Lady Gaga in an ad to show all the opportunities offered by the Chrome browser. Now he has done the same with Justin Bieber.

The announcement is similar to Gaga, but also shares some similarities with the recent announcement Dear Sophie, which shows a father using Chrome and other Google products to remember her daughter's childhood.

It makes sense that Google has thought Bieber for their promotion. The young celebrity was discovered thanks to his performances uploaded to Youtube. And with it, Google manages to reach an important demographic: teenage girls.

One of his secrets: Its well-defined market.

Justin Bieber is not intended that all are his fans; he knows it would be almost impossible, yet the market for young girls have it well controlled. So it adds the elements of marketing, good use of digital tools and a well-defined market and the rest is history. 




 *brumby*

 More brilliance, a review of No Strings Attached from a paper mill:

The funny can be credited to screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether, who not only creates lead characters that are likeable, but has surrounded these people with a surprisingly rich supporting cast. There is not token best friend that gets all the lines. There's actually a posse. Natalie Portman's Emma and Ashton Kutcher's Adam are surrounded by friends and co-workers that are very very funny without having to resort to outrageous infantile humor. Heck, they all seemed like they could be any of the inherently funny people that I know in the real world. 

Adam and Emma meet cute as teenagers at summer camp where his sheepish moves on Emma fall flat. The run into each other again at a frat party in college, then again a few years later. As always happens in the movies, they are destined to end up in the same state, in the same town, at the same time. So when drunk and depressed Adam calls every phone number in his cell for a booty call, he ends up waking up in Emma's Los Angeles flat surrounded by her roommates. Emma is now a workaholic doctor, and Adam works as a middling minion in the television business. Emma doesn't have the time or energy for a real relationship, so she proposes that she and Adam become fuck-buddies. What guy would refuse? 

I think it is interesting that there is a string of "no strings attached" sex comedies spilling into the theaters. And they all seemingly have the same twist (which is not much of a twist when they are all the same): In the modern take, it is the guy who falls for the non-committal woman first. But where the similar setup of Love and Other Drugs failed from lack of chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, Natalie and Ashton actually make a cute couple. Their quips seem natural, and even though Emma is a bit over-the-top bristly whenever she thinks she is being conned into a relationshippy-type moment, she is still appealing. And who doesn't like to see Natalie Portman have an occasional potty-mouth moment? That's right. We all like a smart girl that swears. 

No Strings Attached does falter a bit. It struggles with momentum toward the end as it falls into the predictable territory of whether or not these lovers should also be together for realz. Hollywood does always want the perfect kiss at the end. But until then, I was totally enjoying the ride. Along with great supporting turns by Greta Gerwig, Mindy Kaling, and Lake Bell (along with more awkward appearances by Kevin Kline and Cary Elwes), No Strings Attached is funny escapism with a great cast that won't leave you feeling cheated after your two-hour fling at the movies. 




 More gems from a genuine paper mill producing top notch film criticism:

They're wicked and foul with the stench of 40,000 years. But what would movies be without them? While most are truly quite horrific, others are actually funny. But throughout the many years of cinematic history, one fact has always remained constant about movie villains... we love to hate them. 

Heroes get all the hype, but deep down, we all love a good villain. I can take or leave the square-jawed boy scout, the do-gooder who gets the girl and saves the day; but the villain is a different kettle of genetically modified laser wielding fish altogether. 

Funny Villain have more fun and get most of the best lines. Movie history is littered with fiendish foes, evil overlords and malevolent masterminds we loved to hate. The summer blockbuster is the perfect breeding ground for evildoers and this year's pageant of box office behemoths provides rich pickings, from robots out for revenge to muggle-hating wizards. 

Cinema is filled with memorable villains. Whether it's the sardonic cheer of Gert Frbe's Auric Goldfinger, or the sneering oiliness of Die Hard's Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), the movies are full of superb, loveably evil performances. The hero may get the girl and save the world in most instances, but it's the villain who gets most of the quotable lines. 

It's like the alignment of the planets. Occasionally, a great director, an exemplary script and a gifted actor will join together on the same project, creating the kind of unsettling performances that linger in the memory for years afterwards. 

Michael Mann's 1986 adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel Red Dragon was the first movie to bring cannibalistic academic Dr. Hannibal Lecter (in this instance spelled Lecktor due to rights issues) to the big screen. 

Robert De Niro chews both characters and scenery in a manic performance as Max Cady, an ex-convict who terrorises lawyer Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) for apparently failing to defend him effectively in court fourteen years earlier. 

An indifferent and Funny movie villains can be threatening as a villain with an almost cartoon-like evil uniform like Jason Vorhees from Friday the 13th. In The Matrix (1999), the army of 'faceless' agents are cold and emotionless and suggest an unbeatable threat with which the hero cannot reason or negotiate. 

The all-powerful emotionless villain is portrayed excellently in the X-Files TV series by William B. Davis as the Cigarette Smoking Man. Throughout the series he is constantly in control of the heroes and any attempts to kill him are deemed self-destructive or futile. His power over the protagonists' behaviour is linked to his role in the Syndicate, a mysterious organisation who seemingly are more powerful than the U.S. government. 

On the opposite end of the scale are the villains that are emotive, excitable and with exaggerated personas as demonstrated by Heath Ledger's villain in the most-recent Batman film, The Joker. The latest incarnation of the Clown Prince of Crime perfectly conveys his lack of empathy and almost-humorous contempt for human life. The most prominent aspect of The Joker is his colourful clothing and unusual physical appearance, with white face make-up, dyed green hair and smudged red lipstick.

 This is a film which involve sex industry. Sometimes I think I would rather to catch a triply to watch than to sleep with a dull man, Because each set is very short, it probably still can give you the climax, even it is a neuter version. I still remembered that I really did't think Belle is a beautiful woman when I watched season one. But I have been able to appreciate her beauty to season four. I like to watch her to receive each customer in high spirit. She let me become more believe that there is some people really like to be a prostitute as career. From her, I felt a little shamed, I just in labor, I didn't work hard.but she does't. 

Ben and Han is alike,both are brave,Both have the courage to make a choice, choose what they want, rather than they should.From the start, Ben appeared in Han's world, his state cannot be removed. From season one Ben delayed he and Vanessa' s wedding ceremony, at that moment, I knew he was really love Han.real love. But they finally broke up. Ben wants a family,but Hannah cannot give. just because she know she cannot give,she choose to leave. Hannah just wants to be herself.They separate,not because they don't love each other, they are too love.they love, but cannot give each other they want. So they say goodbye. Losing Ben, it means, Hannah and bell lose everything, but she finally decide so. love, like on you. 

In fact, I know they will not be together at last, but I still hoping. Finally I having no choice but to Give up the lens. Sometimes. Two people who love each other deeply always can not be together. That's it. If it's you. Would you do as Hannah. Choose to leave because love too much. When you can't give your lover what he needs. When you can't let him be happiness. choose to leave is more great than to possess him.

 ###SURPRISE UNDEVELOPED ROMANCE 




 Holes. by the ending they dug a lot of holes.  




 I have a feeling that our next batch of conservative politicians are going to be former Redditors and the debates are going to be even more entertaining because SJW, White Guilt and Triggered Tumblrnas are going to be said on national television with sincerity.  




 **his Ron Paul senses are tingling!** 




 It was Bernie Sanders. YOU'RE NOT GETTING AWAY FROM HIM THIS TIME. 




 [You mean like a Island only inhabited by Redditors who believe in the libertarian principles of Ron Paul and an economy devoted to anime and cheese pizza?](http://gawker.com/5932987/reddit-island-could-an-enthusiastic-online-community-create-a-nerd-oasis-in-real-life) 




 I hope everyone who auditions reads the Im CIA scene.  














 Wow. Digg used to look like Reddit. It's not a bad site now, the curate a bunch of great articles and their subheds on them are  funny. 




 He reported to Ellen Pao, but Alexis is still her boss and Steve Altman is over both of them. Pao didn't even have a board seat.

He's over her and he also admitted to firing Victoria on top of Yishan's clarification. So what's the big deal here? Reddit fucked up. Vigilante internet mobs don't work.  




 What the fuck? She got to taser the fucking mayor for charity? I'm not sure whether living America is awesome or just the most fucked up thing. 




 Make the American Sniper plastic baby CEO of Reddit. 




 Memes. 




 The Band's Visit is an incredible little drama. It's really charming too. 

I would also recommend Lebanon, Ajami, Omar and Bethlehem too.  




 The only guys who are saying this movie is good are the video critics who are already nerds, while I'm seeing general critics who veer toward liking more movies than just comic book ones are finding it meh. 




 If color coordination is the biggest twist in this movie, I'll just gonna stay home and watch the Shahs of Sunset.  




 It's not easy being green...and in a medieval torture device. 




 "We a family"
 




 "No"

"No, you say yes."

"Well...no. what now?"

"I guess nothing. Movies over." 




  Maybe F4 just can't be a movie?

They need to hit F4 and start again without Josh Trank. 




 Who wants to bet the villain says "FIND THEM/HIM/HER" as the camera cuts away with a crescendo of music. 




 I realize now why Vin Diesel is the only guy to make that line work.  




 Ae lamaeo 




 Should put a countdown ticker till all that's left is Ohanian and a bag of popcorn. 




 Ohanian was demoted from chair to co-founder with Steve Huffman. Altman is in charge now. 




 Wow, this is filled with tons of bad information. Victoria was fired by Alexis. Kickme444 confirmed Ellen Pao didn't fire that disgruntled guy because he had leukemia. Shit, that's just the start. Why can't Redditors just admit they don't have all the information and put the pitchforks down? You people are terrible at it, but you guy keep instigating. 




 Because the first thing Reddit needs is another anonymous "Whistleblower" so it can go on another witch hunt. 

Also, who the fuck brings guns to a tech job in silicon valley? Is he Hugh Jackman from Chappie? 




 Moderates were powerless. When /r/videos was on a rampage upvoting that caricature of Ellen Pao singing a parody of Keene's "Somewhere Only We Know," I pretty much realized I was watching a train wreck in progress.   




 John Tuturro as a fucking EGYPTIAN PHAROAH! Best Comedy of 2014. Deserves an Oscar for Best Comedy.  




 Alexis was board chairman. He was Ellen Pao's boss. It flows up to him.  




 Hot Dog Pizza came out during Paogate. I blame Domino's for this. 




 He used the term "dumb dumbs" to showcase his superior intellect. He's an intelligent person.  




 Hear that? It's the sound of Reddit pedaling backwards. 




 I'm nut ur mister, memester. 




 its like this is some kind of suicide thread. 




 Shit, have we ever been linked in drama? I feel like this is an auspicious first.  









 I wonder if the comments on that site ever get any hits in their spam log? 




 You mean the one they show in the trailer? Caw Caw 









 CIA 




 Yeah, but what about skills in Dank Memes? 

Come by /r/movies sometime. We yell at each other about comic book movies, Dredd and Joey Fatone. 




 David Ayer looks like the regular actor people interrogate on Law and Order: SVU 




 ITS SO DENSE EVERYFRAME IS MADE OF MILK SHITTIY 




 SOMEONE CALLED MELISSA MCCARTHY A MISANDRIST? I'M SORRY BUT WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO MR.ANDERIST? 

IS HE HOME?

I'D LIKE TO TELL HIM HIS WIFE IS BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. 




 OH NO. OH NO HE DIDN'T WHAT YOU GONNA DO WHEN /R/MOVIESCIRCLEJERKS STICKIES DOUBLE UP ON YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU??????????????? 




 Do they have some type of Hot Tub Time Machine? 




 Taking handouts from the government? Typical lib Trump. 




 Submission Statement: Alfred Kazin's famous essay in which elucidates why the primary audience of a critic are themselves.
