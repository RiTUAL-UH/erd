 Platform: Xbox One

Time zone: Pacific Standard Time

Level: I have two 31 warlocks, and a 27 Hunter.

Game modes: I love everything in Destiny. Raids, Nightfall, weekly heroic, bounties, PVP, anything. 

Mic: Yes

Gamertag: Jade Sueta

I have a few friends that I raid with, but I would always like to have more people on my friends list I can rely on. Even if I have done Crota's End four times this week I will gladly help you out, too. 

As a side note, I am young. I was told I sound like an eight year old boy, although I am not. I am putting this here because almost everyone who I play with will instantly leave when I talk, assuming I'm an immature squeaker. Just a heads up. 




 Message Jade Sueta 




 Umm, you have 3 hands? 




 Inv GT: Jade Sueta 




 Thanks so much for this I really appreciate it!  




 Me writing my first comment on your first comment on OP's first submission in this sub. 




 We need one more at Crota. Message Jade Sueta if you can help.

 Gt: Jade Sueta  




 I'm mostly on on the weekends all throughout the day and night, but if you have any questions feel free to pm me and I will answer as fast as can. Good Luck Guardian! 




 As the other people are saying, /r/fireteams is amazing. Just keep doing nightfalls, weeklys, and get used to your weapons. You could watch YouTube videos or when your brother gets on maybe he can help you get a group and show you the mechanics. I can show you anytime, would love to take you through VoG for the first time. XB1: Jade Sueta 




 Voidbro + OM + The Dark Beyond. Bounty is done in less than 5 minutes

 I have only done it once, and it was full of cheese. If there is a group out there willing to show me everything the correct way then message Jade Sueta.
