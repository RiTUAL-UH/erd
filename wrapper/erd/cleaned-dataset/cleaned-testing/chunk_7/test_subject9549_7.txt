 If Bronn dies, we riot.  




 I'm not sure if this belongs here... The actor who plays Edmure - Tobias Menzies - recently did an interview, which begins with him talking about GoT and his hope that they eventually tie up Edmure's storyline. I found it funny that he is just as clueless as the fans. [Here's the link](http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/outlander-tobias-menzies-on-going-full-frontal.html) to the interview for those interested.  




 Go Rand! Make Kentucky proud. 

Anyone have a count on how many times Sen. Wyden said "my colleague"?  




 My university is the same way. Graduation is usually on Saturday, grades aren't due until the Tuesday after.  




 I'm a day late to the party, but [I'll leave this picture here anyway](http://i.imgur.com/rYf60RB.jpg). 




 Currently at Pop Century, and yes there is a fridge but no microwave. If you decide not to use Garden Grocer, you could look into shipping items to the hotel. Like order online from Walmart or some other store and instead of shipping the items to your home, ship to the hotel. We ordered water and some breakfast bars from Amazon Pantry and shipped them to Pop - they accepted the package four days before our arrival without any problems and we picked it up at the front desk when we checked in.  




 I am now going to call the black end on a banana "butt nugget." 




 Touch. 




 Isn't birth control [supposed to be free under Obamacare?](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5888320) 




 Random question. I was just looking on the Disney app for wait times at Epcot. It says the wait time for Test Track is 300 minutes, or 5 hours... Pretty sure it was just a crazy error. Does that happen often on the app? 




 I hope you had a safe and wonderful flight! Have a great trip! So far Pop Century is awesome.  




 Woo hoo!! T-minus 24 hours until we board our plane :) 




 I just started packing today! Saturday can't get here soon enough! 









 Thank you! :) 




 Check out [this](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/my-disney-experience/bands-cards/) page over on the Disney website. That should answer your questions!

Basically, if you're not staying at a Disney resort, you'll receive a card instead and you'll have the option to buy a MagicBand online or at Disney World. If you are staying at a Disney resort, you will receive a MagicBand free. To customize your band, sign into your Disney account and under My Disney Experience you'll see "Magic Bands and Card" ([here's a link to it if you have an account](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/bands-cards/)). There, you'll be able to customize your band - there are various colors including pink. According to the Disney website, you have until 10 days before your arrival to customize your band if you want it shipped to your home. If you don't customize your band before then, you'll pick it up at your hotel. 




 Arriving May 9th, staying at Pop Century (my phone autocorrected to Poo Century... Really, phone?). Anyway, I can't wait! I'll be celebrating my birthday on Monday :)
