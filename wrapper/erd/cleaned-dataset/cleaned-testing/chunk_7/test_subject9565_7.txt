 Anne Hathaway and Mark Wahlberg were originally the leads of Sliver Linings Playbook  




 This would backfire because I don't think people would always see the opening night because spending for example $100 for a movie is a lot of money. As a movie lover, I would just wait till the price lowers down or just watch it online. Indie movies, it would be great for because I think people would start watching Indie movies more.  




 ''I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.''- Taken  




 So my friend is in another country coming home, everyone is so surprised because no one expected this to happen. In honest opinion, I'm very overwhelmed because I know someone else who's father just passed away and also my dad is sick with cancer for a few years and I'm scared he'll be next. 

Question: Has anyone been in this situation and what advice would you give me to help her out?  




 See! This is why I love movies! I'm always tempted with sucidial thoughts but I always have a movie that I want to see. So it keeps me want to wait to watch the movie 




 "Can people with hearing loss drive?" A person asked this in this class we had to take to get our license quicker and she knew I had a hearing loss.   




 It seems like you have changed a few things to be with her. She needs to do the same or it won't work. If you are watching the movie not her, she can't control everything. She seems too controlling  




 Ew, she's dating someone who's in high school. Shows that she is immature. you deserve better

 If he really cared about you, he wouldn't of left. He wouldn't want to leave because he would want to be there for you.  




 Life sucks. I know exactly what you are going through. Every single day I think about death and how much easier it will be if I died. But then I realized I'm only 20 years old. My life is shitty, but I can do something about it. I laugh about my life it helps me and I like making others laugh. You are 16 years old, I know you think ending your life will be better but it won't. Your parents may not understand your depression but they will be heart broken to hear that you ended your life. Why don't you go to a support group and meet new friend that you can relate to? Don't give up my friend.  




 I'm sorry for the PM that you have been receiving. You are not a bad person. Feelings change thats understandable that you want to leave him because also he is being very controlling. Being with someone who has been charged for domestic violence charge is very dangerous. If I were you, I would protect yourself because you are very vulerable in this situation. He is very dangerous and he wants you to feel guilty by saying he is going to commit suicide. Maybe he has a mental illness that you are not aware of that triggered the violence etc. 




 Have a performance that shows many scenes where the character has a emotional breakdown, character development and etc. Worked for Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine and Jennifer Lawrence in Sliver Linings Playbook.

 So I wanted to know if there is anything like strategies that they used that has helped decrease the suicidal thought or when they have them what do they do to help get rid of them in a way thats positive? These thoughts I have go in and out of my head, I just want to know if anyone has any strategies that helps them that they would like to share that would be greatly appreciated.  




 I don't know what to say, I'm struggling the same thing to be honest. How am I supposed to help where I can't help myself. I learned that life does suck but its how you deal with the situation it can make life better. Losing a puppy is like loosing your best friend. I can't tell you what that experience is like because I haven't experienced it yet. Being heart broken sucks, but it will get you closer to finding someone who will feel the same way about you. Sometimes we all think we don't have people who care about themselves, but we are wrong. There is people out there who care about you could be your parents, friends, teacher, neighbours, here on reddit. There is someone there for you. I know the feeling of the thought of dying would just make everything eaiser, and trust me I would but knowing that I'm so young and my family would be heart broken kills me inside. Show the girl that she is missing out by doing things you never thought you would do. We all have our moments when we will weak, but it is up to us to steer back into the right directon. Don't give up kid! You can do it.  




 I'm on cipralex for about probably two months now. The beginning you'll notice that you may not be as alert as you used to be that was a side effect for me. I felt very tired at the beginning but then your body will adjust. The medication will not work right away it will take 3 weeks. I was very scared during the 3 week time because my sucidial thoughts increased to the point where I was picturing wires wrapped around my neck. But my doctor increase my dosage and I'm fine so far. Stress can increase your behaviours so try to find coping mechanisms to help you out.  




 I guess they aren't a fan of Easy A then LOL 




 I am Sam, Hotel Rwanda, The Boy In Stripped Pyjamas  




 Easy A 




 Somebody clearly spent a lot of time on this. But this is very interesting 




 I'm hearing impaired, I'm so grateful that I'm able to use my hearing aids. I'm so happy that you re able to experience this. :) 




 There is nothing wrong with talking to someone who is a professional. The feeling will get worse if you keep it inside and you are not getting the help you need. We all need help in different ways. I just got help I don't regret it for a second.  




 Go to the park, and listen to the birds. Go downtown and hear all the buses and cars youll be amazed to hear all these noises 




 If you want to have a relationship with someone you need to be honest with them  




 Just be honest with her and be like the comment you said really bothered me. No one wants to be called disgusting. One day someone told me I look like a bag of shit. Still to this day it bugs me. Comments like that hurt.  




 Like it or not you need to tell him how you feel. Either way he is going to get hurt. No one likes to get dumped especially if he thinks the relationship is going so well that he wants to propose. What would you rather dump him before between you and him or in front of his family while you reject his proposal. If you say yes because you feel gulity thats even worse giving him false hope. Just be honest with him and make time to do it. There is always time you just have to make it  




 Come on, seriously calling someone a cunt its low.

 Pocketful of Sunshine, I heard that song in the movie Easy A. That movie was shown right when my dad first diagnosed to cancer and the song cheered me up  




 Okay I would love to be Veronica Mars. I don't know if it counts, but it went from a TV series to a movie. She's intelligent plus she got like four boyfriends where I can't get shit.  




 Agreed!  




 You can get fired and you are an intern, he's a full time staff member. He can get you fired in a heart beat, all he needs to do is just tell one person and boom basically you put your job in someone elses hand. I'm not trying to scare you but you put yourself in a very bad situation.  




 I have a question because you are an intern and he's a worker isn't that against the code of ethics or something that you are not supposed to be in intimate relationships with staff members. Just be careful because you might of put your intern in jeopardy because you deleted the texts but it doesn't mean he did.  Also from the look of this it seem like he pressured you and made you do things that you said many times no. That is not right, he took your rights away.  Saying sorry during the sexual act or after doesn't make it better. If I were you I would stay away from him.  




 He sounds like an asshole.  




 Loved her in Frozen! Agreed!  




 I saw Pitch Perfect with my friends and two other people in the theatre. It made the experience ten times better because I already saw it a few other times before. I was able to sing and dance because I knew what was happening. It's the best its empty makes the experience better
