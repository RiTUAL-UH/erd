 Sexual incompatibility can totally be a relationship killer. 

BUT, you don't have that problem. 

Sexual incompatibility is when you guys aren't having sex as much as you (or he) thinks you should or wants to and that doesn't seem to be the case. 

As long as you guys are both satisfied with your sex life and the relationship it doesn't matter what other people think. You could have sex one per year or 6 times a day and it still wouldn't matter. 

If you think your boyfriend is unhappy or your need reassurance that he is then talk to him. But, from everything that you've written it sounds like you're both on the same page.  




 Obviously you need to talk to him about it. 

Sometimes though, fantasies are just fantasies. Doggy style might just be something he likes thinking about but (evidently) doesn't like doing. 

Less likely (in my mind at least) is the possibility someone else raised that he's doing research to try something new for you. While that would be awesome I feel like it's probably not the case. 

You need to have an in depth conversation with him about why he doesn't like the position. Does it not feel pleasurable? Does he feel like it is degrading to you? Does he feel uncomfortable not being able to see your face?

There is a real reason and you need to suss it out and only then can you possibly work on moving past it. 

Good luck. And remember to be a gentle as possible during the conversation. Use 'I' statements where ever possible (I would like it if we... I like doggy because...) and avoid 'you' statements (You only like it when we... You never want to try new things) because they can sound accusatory and make him defensive.  




 Have your boyfriend sleep on the couch. 

You are a guest in his home, you can be considerate of his wishes when you visit. It's not a complete imposition. 

Is it silly? Yes. Would you and your BF staying in the same room destroy your nephew's faith? No. 

But, it's for a short period of time, I'm sure your relationship with your BF can handle a couple nights not in the same bed and it would make your brother more comfortable. 

Try not to focus on it while you're there and just have a good visit. It's a small thing, you can handle it.  




 You aren't being a bitch, your husband is acting like a child.

If his single mid-late 20's co-workers want to go out every night and get drunk and party at strip clubs that is their choice.  His choice was to get married and have a family and there are responsibilities that go along with that choice.  He needs to start living up to those responsibilities.

First he needs to start communicating with you on when he expects to be home.  That's just basic courtesy.  

Then you guys need to set and agree on some boundaries.  How many nights per week will he go out with his co-workers?  Is it acceptable to visit strip clubs on non-special occasions?  What activities need to be cleared/discussed prior to their occurrence?

If he balks at either request (communication or boundaries) then he needs to consider whether he wants your marriage to work.  For a marriage to work both people have to be committed and present and right now, he is not present (and maybe not committed either).

Either way, something needs to change.  




 * What do people look for in a romantic partner?
That varies from person to person I think but mainly in the details. In general people want someone they are attracted to, someone who finds them attractive, someone they share interests and values, and someone who they enjoy being with. 

* Me sending funny pictures/articles that remind me of them, etc., is that weird? What are normal clear-interest showing examples of things to do when seeing someone?
I'd say that's not weird. Be aware thought that different people are comfortable with different levels of affection/interest at different times. I would say continue to be yourself and you will find someone who appreciates what you have to offer. 

* What is the fundamental or "core" of a relationship?
For me, attraction and trust. 

* How much interest is too much/too little? 
There's no hard rule. Some guys (and gals) are going to accept/expect higher levels sooner than others. Find the level you are comfortable with and express that and if you aren't getting what you expect back then say so. 

* How to not be vapid without having to be a ball of energy at the time?
You don't have to be constantly excited about everything but I find it very attractive when women are passionate about something. Have something in your life that you care deeply about and be open to new experiences. That's all anyone can ask of you.

 Your boyfriend is not perfect. 

It's great that he's been there for you through your illness/diagnosis but I guarantee he is/has been feeling stressed by the whole thing. 

If you believe his apology to be sincere then accept it. 

It's hard to the other person watching someone you love suffer like that and have nothing you can do to fix it. Especially for guys because we like to fix things. 

What he said was not supportive and you definitely have a right to be upset about it. I just wouldn't take it as a sign that he thinks you fake things or are a hypochondriac since he's never given that impression before. 

Let him know you were hurt by his comments, accept his apology and move on. It's ok to be upset (for both of you), just don't let it poison what otherwise sounds like a good relationship.  




 You guys weren't trying to get pregnant and from what you wrote it doesn't sound like you even knew you were pregnant until after the miscarriage. 

That must have been a shock and I'm really sorry you had to go through that at all and especially without support from your boyfriend. 

My wife and I have been through 5 miscarriages in many stages from 1 week to 12 weeks. It's a little different for you because you didn't know you were pregnant at the time but let me say that men and women process pregnancy very differently. 

It's hard for men to conceptualize babies in the womb. For a lot of men it's even hard to get attached emotionally to babies until they are able to have actual interaction of some kind (what level of interaction that triggers an emotional response varies from man to man I have found). 

All of that is to say that your boyfriend might be experiencing a lot of different emotions that he doesn't know how to process and that those emotions are probably very different from what you experienced/are experiencing. 

Don't assume you can read his mind/know how he's feeling without hearing it from him. 

I suggest you sit down and have a serious conversation with him about how the miscarriage made you feel and how you felt unsupported by his actions. Let him know the kind of support you would have liked at the time and what you would like going forward. Ask him how he is feeling and encourage him to actually discuss his feeling and not just brush them off. 

If you come to find that it's not a wave of unprocessed emotions that are making him act like an unsupportive jerk and he just is a jerk then by all means end things. 

Just don't assume you know what he's thinking or feeling ahead of time. 

Just because he's a guy doesn't mean he's automatically an unfeeling caveman. He still might be that but it's not a default setting we all share.  




 1 Find a divorce lawyer, in case you want to go that route, knowing steps to take ahead of time is never a bad idea. 

2 Find a therapist. While the internet is always here for venting, talking to a professional is more beneficial 

3 Talk to your husband. Tell him you know about the affair. Be prepared for him not to admit to everything at once. This is not acceptable but it is bound to happen anyway. Find out if he wants to save the marriage. Be prepared (as much as you can be) that his answer may be no. 

If he says yes, he needs to cut contact with her NOW. Not tomorrow, not ASAP, NOW. If he wants to save the marriage he doesn't owe her a face to face, he doesn't owe her an explanation. Have him call her, text her, email her in front of you and then no further contact. He also needs to keep you aware of any contact they have going forward. If he runs into her at a restaurant, if she texts him, whatever.

Make it clear that any contact that happens that he doesn't immediately report is a deal breaker for you. There can be no half measures on rebuilding trust. He has to recognize that he broke it so he has to fix it.

You guys also need to see a therapist together to work through the trust rebuild and any other issues that exist or may arise. 

It's not going to be easy. The whole thing sucks and will continue to suck for a long time. 

All of this, of course, is assuming that you want to save the marriage. That is something only you can decide and no one would blame you if you wanted to just be done with him. 

I'm sorry you're going through this. Good luck.  




 Tell your friend that, as he is aware, you are going through a rough time in your marriage and you need to focus on your relationship with your husband. Furthermore, since you crossed a line with him you need to have no more contact with him going forward   

If he is a decent person he will understand and comply. If he isn't, don't take no for an answer. 

Tell your husband when you have the end of contact conversation with your friend and then let him know ANY time you have further contact, no matter who initiates and no matter how small the contact. 

Any hidden conversation  that comes out can totally destroy trust between you and your husband. 

Good luck working through this!  I believe you can do it as long as you both stay focused on each other.  




 If he isn't already he should get hooked up with the local VA center.

As someone else mentioned, there is no time limit on PTSD and honestly (if that is the problem) going longer without treatment will only make things worse. 

And if that isn't the problem there are specialists that can help him diagnose the issue. 

I'm a Marine as well and I know it's tough for people like us to seek out help. 

Just do everything you can to let him know that you love and support him and that you don't think anything less of him, although probably don't mention that last bit unless he asks. 

Be ready with examples of how you don't consider him a failure to say in case he expresses that sentiment.  Tell him you are happy to talk things through and then give him space to decide when/if he wants that conversation to happen. 

I'm sure he's aware already but he's really lucky to have someone so supportive in his life. I wish you both lots of luck and I know you guys can make it through this.  




 I'm sorry you've had such bad experiences. 

I am a 33M just back on the dating scene and if I had started seeing someone and they reacted as you did I would be all for it. 

I think the problem is the guys you've been finding, not you. I know that doesn't make it suck any less but I think the only solution is for you to keep meeting people. 

Be honest with what you're looking for in a relationship (or out of one, depending on your preference) and I'm sure you will find a good fit for you. 

Good luck! 




 You need to bring up counseling again and this time don't take no for an answer. 

Make it clear that even if he doesn't see the problems the same way (ie, not as big a deal) they are a big deal to you and they need to be addressed. 

Don't accept 'I'll do this better' or 'I'll do more of that' because things will go back to the norm. 

I don't think you guys are totally hopeless but you both need to work at it. 

Additionally, I know you don't want to, but you need to cut contact with this other guy. 

As someone else said, it isn't fair for your husband to have to compete with someone you're not having issues with. If you want the marriage to work your focus should be there, not anywhere else.  




 Ok. Thanks for the heads up. 

Guess I'll be unlocking Shores first.  




 I'm on the Xbox. 

I just finished 'Assist the Zhentarim' step of the campaign and have Shores of Tuern and Lair of Lostmauth available (just missing requirements). 

My question: are the unlock costs a one time thing or do I have to pay that every time I want to run them? 




 I play a Cleric, usually on everyday.
