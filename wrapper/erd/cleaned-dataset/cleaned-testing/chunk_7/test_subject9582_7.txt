 I'm sorry but it's still not making much sense. Can you ELI5?
 




 I'm going off of the movie Labyrinth. How did Sarah know who was lying or not? 









 I was trying to stick up for you.
 




 It's all cool. Perhaps /u/oree94 is a young buck/doe.

 As far as I Know, there are no dogs at the Burrow. 




 I'll be there to secure a Ravenclaw win.
 




 I have to during that evil week of the month. Speaking of.. 









 Thanks, we went out, and the sky opened as soon as we left. 




 When Albus escaped from Fudge, Umbridge, two aurors, and the Junior Secretary of the ministry, he spoke to a portrait of a past headmaster called Fortescue. Is that perhaps an elder of Florean, the ice cream guy? 




 noobs.

Edit: it was meant to be humorous.
 




 Which is sad in it's own way because Neville and Luna got the most structure from the DA.  














 I agree, and I think Harry made a mention of this. Sorry, but my HBP is not on me.
 




  ...he defends him during the dementor attack.

*This* I think was the biggest factor. Dudley leaving Harry a cuppa each day.. he knew what was going on. Even though Ms. Rowling said that they would get together so the kids could know each other, I hope that they could chat about Harry blowing up aunt Marge, and have a laugh.

 









 The DA was only formed because Umbridge wouldn't let the students use practical magic. If Fudge believed Dumbledore, he would not have placed Dolores at her post. 




 There would probably be no DA. 




 You are correct. 




 Thanks. 




 I don't think dragons are beasts of burden. I think they are highly intelligent beings that live long and productive lives. I liken their intelligence to that of a djinn or genie. They will help you, but at your expense.

But then some dragons talk and others are just beasts, as you mentioned. 




 That's Pottermore, right? Been a few years since I have read it. 









 If you figure that a dragon's heart is probably a meter across, and wands are generally between 10-12 inches, add in the other cores making them less needful, and I'm sure there would almost be a surplus.

Edit: I would be interested to know what type of person is chosen by a dragon wand. I have one on Pottermore. 




 Dragons do die ya know, and they tend to be pretty large beasts.
 




 The taboo takes away all protective charms disapparition. Sort of like the caterwauling charm in Hogsmead. 




 Eastern Kentucky. 














 They have still been adding to the previous books. 




 It wasn't that She rehashed old information, it was all the crazy spins and input She put on each bit. I think I'm going to re reread it and take notes.

Edit: I posted earlier that the Dursley bit was underwhelming.
 




 Thank you.
 




 What I love most about it is that it's so close to the books, and so well done. She did skip over a few things, but I expect they will be addendums. 




 Let's hope. 




 I would do nothing less than keep fighting. 




 Stone faced mannequin, tyvm. 




 Correct, but all of her cleverness was omitted. I thought Bonnie did a great job, I just hated her directing.
 




 That could be true, but cats have always been magical/mystical beings.

Also Kneazles are magically intelligent cats. 




 One more thing, why is it called the decoy Harrys instead of the seven Potters? I thought Ms. Rowling had control of this? 




 That bit was really underwhelming, only one mention of Dudley. 




 The films took away every bit of Ginny's character, so I would expect nothing less. 




 Remember my last referred to the actual letter he left with Harry on the doorstep if 4 PD. 




 Great job catching up!

 Book of Love was the perfect song for the finale, too. 




 It's on the road to Sky Bridge, a little stop off on the left. 




 My wife and I have been going since 2000, and now we take our daughters. We always love Auxier Ridge, and we stop at Devil's Gulch for sunsets. 

We do the shorter hikes during the heat.

Edit: I always love the backside of angel's windows. Just discovered that two years ago.
 




 Why not just bang dudes? Go to a bar, get free drinks, and then go bang them.
 




 You could do that now.
 




 Auxier? 




 Right? I would play with my boobs all day too, but what if they weren't that big? Why jill off when you could just get laid?
 




 This is our annual trip to the Red. Last year we went to the Smokies first and stopped at the RRG on the way back. 




 Who says you would have one big enough? 




 It's not that hard. Haven't you ever watered a plant with a hose? 




 Cheers.
 




 I would go to every bar, and get guys to buy me drinks. 




 HA! 




 Not sure about that because Andromeda was kicked out of the family for not staying true to the pureblood beliefs. I would assume that Lucius and Narcissa wouldn't talk about her and Ted at all. 









 Hippogriff. Because how cool would it be to have a frickin' horse eagle in your backyard whenever you wanted to go anywhere? 




 I taped Larry Lester's buns together. Had to spend a Saturday in detention. 









 Do you have this reply saved somewhere? or just memorized? I hope there's pudding. 




 I used to be so happy when Dumbledore awarded the quartet the points, and Neville was the last one. Cross my heart, I would cry sometimes.
 




 Decent.

 Someone would buy it I'm sure, but it goes for a couple hundred USD I think. So unless it's sealed that's about it.

You'd probably be lucky to get a bill. 




 if I should be happy or sad that Hoover is a bright spot on the roster... 




 Here they are, [1](http://i.imgur.com/UmpPtqh.jpg), [2](http://i.imgur.com/zvDYxts.jpg), [3](http://i.imgur.com/TL43eKy.jpg).

I didn't go far enough to see Lucius in the last one, but he's there. 




 "Aren't those tentacula leaves, sir? Very valuable, aren't they?" 




 My DH2 bluray/DVD is like that. 




 ..and when he showed at the ministry and was emanating power. 




 I don't think Begbie would have made a good Snape. I wouldn't be able to get past his previous roles. 




 Niether could live while the other survives.

Sybill made another correct prophecy. I believe that The Dark Lord caused his own downfall by trying to do too much, in turn making it fairly easy for Harry to defeat him. 




 I know Heather. That's why I am stepping down. I'm going to be AFK(holidays) for a long time, and I don't feel like it's fair for the house. 




 Shoe... 




 nice catch, I was outside. 




 I will add that Harry got the firebolt at christmas, not the end of term. 









 No man, there are no Cliff's Notes for Harry Potter. But if you want a quick refresher, explore Pottermore. 




 I doubt it since the Dept. of Mysteries was a British thing, and they were the ones experimenting with time. It wasn't a worldwide phenomenon.
 




 My fault, misunderstood your comment. By that time all the time turners were destroyed because She forsaw what a plot hole they could become. 




 No, It had already happened that way. Buckbeak/Witherwings never died.

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_loop) is some more info on the STLT.
 




 Nope, She has also said that anything more than five hours is seriously messing with nature. 




 Ms. Rowling subscribes to the 'Stable Time Loop Theory', meaning everything that has happened will always happen, there is no changing the past. 




 Pretty much. 




 While Lily's blood sacrifice was in Voldemort, it tethered Harry to life as long as Riddle was alive, which is why Dumbledore had a flash of triumph in his eye when Harry was explaining what happened in the graveyard. 




 Correct, making Riddle a sort of 'anti-horcrux' for Harry. 




 I'm telling my principal on you. 




 Lightweights maybe, and the proper term is cannabis. Marijuana was used as a scare tactic in the 30s to make people think it only grew in Mexico. 




 I don't think so, not with the Stable Time Loop. 




 It's a 'Trailer Park Boys' joke. 




 What do you think are some examples? 




  Molly Weasley's maiden name is Prewett.

Her *mading* name 




 It's pronounced exactly like it's spelled I'm pretty sure. 




 What? How the hell could that happen?  




 Riker: Can't stay away from the big chair, can you?

Troi: I don't think I'm cut out to be captain. First officer maybe, I understand that there aren't many qualifications.

Makes me smile every time.
 




 Shawshank Redemption. Rita Hayworth, buuuddy. 




 I have, and it's rather pleasant, but only after a shower.
