 Will you be my swag 5ever? 




 Just like when the police went to my buddy's house because they didn't know his address. 




 TIL 




 I have kind if a similar story. The whole family went with me to the shelter to pick out a cat and one of them came up to us and just jumped into the baby stroller. I'd like to think she adopted us :)  




 Small town in Switzerland here... everything closes at 5 and nothing is open on Sundays. Consider yourself lucky. 




 Wow awesome. Thanks for this OP 




 They're reminders

 Ahoy! 




 Proud of myself for still not having seen this. 




 I feel like shit knowing I missed this :( 




 I really don't understand this. How the fuck is your sexual preference interfering the way you play?  




 this gave me cancer 




 OP you're a fag 




 Could not agree more. I'm turly sorry for your loss man. Self medicating is not the answer. I think you just need someone you can talk to. Stay strong bro.  




 To clarify, that isn't me. 




 My hands just got sweaty. 




 You know it's gonna be a bad day when you've seen something on Twitter before Reddit.
