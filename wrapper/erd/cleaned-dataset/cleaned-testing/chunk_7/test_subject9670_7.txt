 not *all* day, and not just here. but thanks for the advice 






















































 ...oh, you'd be surprised! :) 
































































 yeah, u/microbiomedigest and I are the only two that ever really post to it... and she at like a 10:1 ratio to me ... esp lately...  and *no* one ever comments but... it's steady.  a little repetitive, but I suppose that's how things in that field are going to go for a while?

 That's not only really cool, but it also makes a lot of sense... But 1km of wire sounds both heavy and like it'd take up a lot of room for something with 'nano' in its title.

I was thinking more a compressed co2 cartridge (like a bb gun) that either slowed it down or pushed it down such that its orbit would begin to decay pretty quickly.

But, hell, the 1km spool of conducting 'nanowire' may end up being able to both take up less room *and* weigh less.

Either way, it's a 'doable' thing if they think to incorporate it

 I agree... but drones are still a great way to get intel. 









 Definitely on that last part, but they're still a lot cheaper.

Stricter standards on how   when we fire on targets is definitely long overdue. 




 what's wrong with drones?  they're a helluva lot cheaper than boots on the ground 




 you can buy it online already.  ...unless you're talking about larger quantities? 



































































































 'could' being the key word there, I think. 



















  There are 456 million hectares  an area about the size of the European Union  under cultivation in and around the world's cities

 "We found that 80% of urban croplands occur in low- to middle-income countries," said Anne Thebo of the University of California, Berkeley. "We also found that 60% of urban or peri-urban croplands are irrigated. Urban croplands are twice as likely to be irrigated as their non-urban counterparts."

 Within cities alone there are about 24 million hectares of land under irrigation, and 44 million hectares that are rain-fed, the researchers found. They also note the prospect of "irrigated urban croplands playing a larger role in more densely populated and/or increasingly water-scarce regions, such as South Asia". 




  According to Steinfeld et al (2006), livestock takes 70% of all agricultural land and 30% of the planet's land surface.

  Terran is launching small satellites that orbit at only 600 kilometers. That lower altitude makes it practical for low-powered, even disposable, sensors to use a satellite data link, says Previte.

that's such a low orbit that all they'd need is a small burst of 'last minute use' to push them into a very quick decaying orbit in such that they'd burn up pretty quickly. 

but, again, he's probably right :)
