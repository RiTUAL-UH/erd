 A shorter commute and a change of scenery could be just what you need to get yourself in a better place mentally. It's worth a try. 




 It's up to you, obviously. But in my experience, high pressure sales tactics rarely lead to anything good.

Also, seems like a lot of training to be able to sell cars. What are they training you on? 




 I guess. 

But a traditional  hearing aid is just an amplifier. Modern ones can select out certain frequency ranges to amplify, but that's pretty much all they do.

These devices can amplify or muffle certain frequencies or add processing on top of that. These could have come in handy back in the day when I used to go clubbing. The music was always too loud for me and it impeded my ability to chat up pretty girls.  




 The remake of Big Trouble is probably going to be terrible, because most remakes are pretty terrible. But it's not going to be terrible because The Rock is going to be playing Jack Burton.

Look, most of us who are fans of the movie get the central joke of the film. Jack Burton, the putative hero of the piece, is actually the goofy, comic relief. 

So there's some concern that, with Johnson playing the main role, Burton will be a straight ahead action dude, thus ruining the movie. 

But Johnson has the talent and the inclination to play silly, goofy roles. He's never been just a straight action hero. Go watch him in Be Cool or The Tooth Fairy. And I think he's smart enough to know what paying this character is going to require from him. 














 eBay, dude. You can get boxes of random, used Lego for way cheap. 




 As long as James Hong reprises his role as Lo-Pan, I'm OK with it. 









 Maybe I'm just old, but manipulating physical objects is still more fun that pointing and clicking them on a computer screen. 














 I think eventually they will. We'll hit the saturation point and there will be a big retrenchment. 

Marvel is set to weather the storm, I think. Most of their movies aren't straight superhero flicks. GOG is a space adventure. Winter soldier was a spy movie. I get the feeling that Ant-Man is going to be a heist movie. Etc. 




 It would have been better if they thought you were Kevin Matchstick 




 Yeah, USA Today kinda blows. 

Here's a [better article](http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article22753806.html)

Besides 1998, the inaugural year, the only time Thompson has missed the race was in 2013, because shed recently had all but one of her upper teeth removed as a result of an oral cancer that also took her upper jawbone. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, she did it while the disease was eating away at her mouth. 














 A protein bar? I'm pretty hosed, yeah. 









 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. 




 They raised over one and a half million dollars. 




 In other words, he did the same thing that every other President with a Social Security surplus has done. That's what you mean, right? 

How stupid do you have to be to believe this shit? 









 Also, as a 1099 contractor, there are things you can deduct from your taxes that you can't as an employee. 

For example, keep track of your travel.  As an employee, commuting is on you and you can't write that off. As a contractor, you'll be able to deduct the IRS rate for every mile you drive work work.

Here's a good [1099 primer](https://tryzen99.com/blog_posts/the-7-most-common-1099-tax-mistakes)

If you're going to be doing this long-term, spend a little money and consult with a tax professional. A little money now could save you a lot of money down the road.

Also, as an aside, the IRS has some pretty strict rules about who is allowed to get a 1099 and who must be paid on a W2. If you are treated like an employee and paid with a 1099, the IRS can bring the hammer down on your employer in a big way. 




 I don't see the point of trying to bullshit about this. The cat's out of the bag. He knows you went on an interview, so he knows you've been looking for a new position.

Come Monday, don't mealy mouth it. Be honest, but respectful. When he asks you what your plans are, turn it around and ask him what his plans are for you. 

Tell him you've been working there for a year, for low pay. He just denied you a raise. Yet your position is so vital they you can't even take a sick day. He basically forced your hand.

Don't be a jerk, but don't be weak. Believe in your own value. If he doesn't want you to look for a new position, make him to convince you why you shouldn't. Ask for firm commitments.

Hey, maybe he's an asshole and fires you anyway, either now or in a few months. But you're not going to avoid that with lies and bullshit.

And from now on, keep your mouth shut. 




 I'd say mid to late 90's is when personal computers became ubiquitous in the office environment. Before than, it was possible to have an office job and not have one on your desktop. 

It was around this time my boss gave up the typewriter he'd stashed in the corner of his office. 




 Most distracting make-up? Is there an award for that? Because a bunch of times during the movie I was like, "What the...who is that? What is that supposed to be?"

If that's the effect they were going for....kudos. 





























 Yes, Madden used to mention that from time to time when he was calling a Giants game. 




 The thing is, sometimes you have to be blunt. Some people just refuse to take the hint. 

Guys like Steve rely on the fact that most people try to be accommodating and helpful when then can and don't like to give a flat no. 

There will probably come a time when you realize that all of your attempts to deflect and redirect Steve just aren't working and you'll have to flat out tell him no. Be prepared for that.

Just remember, no can be a complete sentence. There's no need to explain. No, I can't. No, I won't. I'm sorry, no. No. No. No.

Best of luck to you. 




 Don't make excuses for people because of their age. Computers have been a mainstream part of office life for nearly two decades. A professional person should have picked up how to make a simple PowerPoint or perform other, basic computer tasks at this point. 









 Seriously? 




 Yes. I dated this one girl. She was actually my first. She took my v-card and then dumped me a week later to date one of my friends.

Then, about a year later, she dumped him and started dating me again. We were together for the whole summer. I started a new job in August and she dumped me a couple weeks after that.

She ended up marrying one of my (other) friends and moved with him to live in a trailer park in Montana. That didn't last and they headed back east and split up.  

I got married (to someone else) and lost track of her after a while. A couple years back I decided to Google stalk her and found her FB page. We reconnected a bit and had lunch last year when she was in town.  




 Yes indeed. Well spotted. 




 Yeah, I watched the Live Leak video with the guitar music and I was all, "Ha ha, what a moron." 

Then I followed the link to the news report and read about the five year-old girl dying. Now I feel sick. 














 Former athlete, NFL QB I think, working for a sports management agency.  




 If I lived in Texas, I'd buy myself a single-action Colt and walk around with it strapped to my hip like Wyatt Earp.  




 There are a lot of devices that will play files from your HDD to your TV.

Here's my setup:

1) Synology Diskstation (NAS) with all my video files
2) WD TV Live box connected to my TV

WD TV Live can see all kinds of shares and play just about any kind of file.  




 Just let it go, dude. 

You don't know what was going on with your boss that day. Maybe he was upset that you were leaving. Maybe he was dealing with some other issues and your leaving didn't even cross his mind.

You're done. You may never see this guy again. Why make yourself upset about it?

You've got a brand new PhD, a new job and a the whole future ahead of you like an open road. Embrace it. Good luck. 




 Are they putting him in the [hacker tank](http://www.thecomicstrips.com/store/add.php?iid=80460 submit=Get+it!) 









 Too many quick cuts for a real 80's vibe.  




 Nicely done.  




 I'm going to give it few episodes and see how it goes.

I love The Rock, so I'm hoping it's just a case of a the trailers trying too hard. 




 Yeah, I was pretty excited about this when I first heard about it, but the trailers have been underwhelming.  














 I'd love to see it, but CW is pretty full up already.  









 The article talks about and links to two different studies by two different research teams that were both published in the May 27 Science Translational Medicine. 



















 I have The Little Mermaid with the "special" cover illustration. 




 Doesn't look great. 




 Yes. Yes. An internal investigation has cleared us of all wrongdoing. Why would anyone doubt us. We are the injured party, after all. 




 None of this is particularly new or exciting. You can look at the career of Roy Lichtenstein, whose most famous works were blatant rip offs of comic book panels.  




 I'm surprised that The Rock hasn't done more straight-up action movies.  
























 Here some [more info](http://abcnews.go.com/US/hudson-river-kayak-mystery-vincent-viafores-body-idd/story?id=31307061)

prosecutors said last month that Graswald admitted to investigators that she tampered with Viafore's kayak so that it would take on water. Prosecutors said Graswald also told police that she watched Viafore struggle in the Hudson's icy waters for several minutes before he went under.  




 I think I've seen that one. 




 You don't need to prove anything to get an indictment. Just reasonable cause to believe. 



















 It's a little disturbing that it takes a Justice Department lawsuit for them to agree to this. It's even more disturbing to realize that, for a lot of police departments, this stuff is perfectly fine. 
























 If you document it properly, you can sue them for it when you leave. 

Sadly, some states don't care too much about going after wage theft, but you always have recourse to the courts. Walmart has gotten nailed for this more than once.
