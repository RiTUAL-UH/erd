 I agree with this. Do not take laxatives. Just watch what you eat. Maybe do some extra running or steady state if you have time. 




 I just have a few bites of greek yogurt mixed with oats, berries, honey, and chia seeds the night before so everything is nice and soggy. Keeps me from getting hungry during practice even though I eat just a little.  




 My coaches always say the sleep you get the night before a 2k is just as important as the sleep you get two nights before a 2k, so try to get a good amount of sleep both nights before your test. Good luck! 




 Thank you very much!
