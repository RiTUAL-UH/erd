 After 9/11 U.S. Fire Administrator David Paulison described a list of useful items in case of a chemical, biological or radiological terror attack. In his advisory Paulison recommended plastic sheeting and duct tape to seal the windows. To me this sounds like a ludicrous suggestion. How effective would plastic and duct tape be against a  chemical or biological attack?
