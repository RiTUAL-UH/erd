 Usually someone will take the podcast and host it somewhere else. so the plug is usually for those cases

 Legit Shoot WWE2K match where the match are legit, but wrestlers are playing on the XBOne instead of in the ring using their own characters 




 Hitbox.tv and Gaminglive.tv are honestly better and faster than twitch. But yeah, once you found out how to use Youtube, you would never want to go back  




 - More CDN across countries, like for me in Asia, this is waaay smoother than Twitch
- Silky smooth Google connections
- Everyone has a youtube app on their phone, you don't need to install a third party app to view it
- Monetization. 
- All of your streams are archived, and encoded by Youtube automatically

There are a few kinks (I feel that they could make this easier for game streamers, right now it's targeted for people who are doing things like concert and such) but IMO once you get the hang of it, it's miles better than twitch 




 Twitch has too much traffic streaming along it's stream, hence for people like me that lives in far flung regions (I live in Asia) it induces stutters and lags. 

Some people solves that using Ghostery but I rather use Youtube right now 




 I love Matt Striker's "This moment has just become an instant classic"  tho.  









 I just realised your edit. Sorry mang :/ 









 You mean Broadcasting? The built in broadcasting is good if you're only streaming to one or two people. For more people, it would be better to use an ingest server in between so you're not wasting your bandwith 




 You can embed it without the chat on your site, and use your own chat box like from chatango or a JS IRC box 









 Oh god, you reminded me of an online race I had on rFactor years ago at Valencia. penalties and start accident meant I was 15s behind 3rd place, and after the last pitstop I was catching him lap by lap. I was so in the zone and like in a trance. And my roommate had to tap me on the shoulder and ruin it all :/ 




 Audio out of sync? 









 She meant "Perfect" 




 The new ones are made from painted wood I think.  




 Rumours are he's turning heel this Sunday.

But honestly, I am so hyped about the matches that I did not even care he's included or not in the first place. He was not in the Raw after Payback (with Randy) and was blended into the background as Ambrose and Rollins take the spotlight for the last two weeks, and it kinda worked.  




 That guitar riff at the start always reminds me of Benoit's entry riff.

 LU is a Telenova with wrestling in it. Completely different from WWE which is wrestling with drama in it.

There is no suspension of reality, since, well, you know it's a telenova. so just sit back and enjoy the ride.

But if you enjoy kayfabe that is spliced with real life, then it maybe hard to get into LU  




 For an easier comparison, this is like Wrestlemania 3. Everybody WANTS to see Andre vs Hogan, but Savage and Steamboat stole the show 




 Maybe the shorter time for editing? Smackdown for me looks like it uses the "Live" style of RAW, where they just edit the show as it goes. Make sense as they need to send the tapes to international market a day after it's taped 




 There were only three times that the German anthem were not played last year. Guess when that was 




 FIA/FOM has the feed for all the cars during the race. I'm sure something as controversial as this would have been released by the FIA/FOM to help gather more viewers to F1 




 And he has to handle 

1 - Singapore Media

2 - Malaysian Media (X2 one on one)

3 - Regional (South East Asia) Media

Each would need a special answer and know how for their culture and WWE's individual reach in that country, so Dolph needs to be briefed about that first. Totally more hectic than the schedule makes out

 He has a limited time to do his notebook feature.  




 F1 broadcasters that elect to use English commentary are provided with SkyF1's commentary by the FOM, except for USA which does their own broadcast 









 I think a Reigns heel turn would be much more interesting. The crowd is still 50/50 on Reigns, and he's not Cena who is the appointed Superman and won't turn heel.

Heck, he might turn out to be as charismatic as the Rock given a heel turn.  




 Big Van Vader is one and he has an illustrious career as a heavy wrestler that moves like a lightweight. 




 WWE sometimes acknowledge ROH on TV, but it's rare. This is usually in return for ROH letting WWE using their footage for documentary and such

Interestingly they acknowledge the  IWGP belt that Lesnar won, so they kinda acknowledge NJPW in general

 Actually NXT is the sum of a lof of contributers. Never pin down NXT's success or growth to one man, because it's not. And I don't think anyone down in NXT would want to either

HHH, Regal, Dusty, Terry Taylor, Norman Smiley, Steve Keirn, Gerald Brisco, Del ray, and a lot more contributed to the growth and the high quality product that we are seeing today.  




 Leva was not even wrestling under any names. She was supposedly a no name jobber to Carmella. Ironically she was the one that caught people's eye 




 For any South East Asian? Rice. We ate rice for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and some students who were sent overseas even went sick when they can't find rice to cook there

The reason we are not sick of rice is because it can easily be eaten with anything. Fried meat, gravy, veggies, heck if you're out of money even soy sauce would do 




 Depending on the tracks IMO. The first corner for watkin glens for example can be taken on it's entirety off track without penalty. so some corners are more strict than others

One thing for sure tho, Spa and Bathurst have bugs where if you pit, you will be given a penalty when exiting the pit lane which makes no sense as the car is auto controlled by the game 




 EC3 and the dancer formerly known as Brodus Clay walked under a disco ball in a segment poking fun of his WWE run 




 Josh is saying the only reason people know who Samoa Joe is, is due to TNA, which is true, somewhat.

 Huh? I used the combo of both and never have to do this. Windows detected them as two separate controllers as well as P Cars. Calibration works fine. 




 1080p @120Hz

GTX970 SLi with default settings. Usually I'll get 100++FPS which is good enough for that smooth effect I guess.  




 My G25 was the first generation G25 and the first one to be brought in Malaysia by a friend of mine. He already had it 3 years before selling it to me and it's still working til today.  




 P Cars has shitty DRS animation. I had mine opening mid corner for some reason even tho it's off 




 They harvest energy under heavy braking. That is why even now there are times when a car goes for a fast lap with Kers, do a fast lap without to recharge and do another one with Kers again 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1mQ9Im-EbI

Without the overdone motion blur 




 Depends. A little traction control would help the car going out of a slow corner

Interestingly I think it was the first year of "legal" traction control where Hakkinen turned his off and immediately took pole in Spain. 




 Tradition. Just like the Dutch TT's Moto GP race is on Saturday instead of Sunday.

Ironically the GP2 have their race on Fridays 




 For me :

 I now wish that they would get Angelico to NXT, and have him in a match with Joe. Angelico would climb on top of the rafters and fly and Joe would nonchalantly swat him away 




 I honestly thought butcher was going to die in that match. 

 




 When combined with the TV equipment/HD/pyro. They do run house shows there still 




 Too many limes! 




 She also should wear something purple but that's just a minor thing.

She could easily get anything she wants, considering the new WWE seamstress (?) is her fiance 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKmEpRDPWBE feature=youtu.be

The best I could do for now is a 1:20. Lot more time to be found tho. I still yet to soften the suspension  and increase diff lock.

But the hardest thing is in real life, Monaco is lapped with a super soft tyre. PCars only has one tyre compound and it's suited for every circuit so that means it's harder than what  you would use in real life, hence slower 




 god. Will be a while to wait til December :/ 




 I used Sony before, the A300 and the A55. What i usually do is focus on the track where the car will be going and start to prefocus there

 This happened with Hamilton at Sepang last year. He pitted in the lead and Hulkenberg inherited the lead, but Hulkenberg pitted before he completed that lap, so Hamilton was still considered to be the leader for that lap and got the Grand Chelem 




 It was banned before the race. But people forgot that it was not only McLaren but also other teams like Jordan were using the same thing. Only McLaren was caught.

Ron Dennis was so smug when the team easily won without the system

I'll try upload the 1998 season review if you want to know more 




 True. Not to mention they would also get TNA's library, that includes the TNA-NWA years, as well as Christian's first world champ reign

 MOTHERFUCKING Owens came out in The Champ is Here shirt. That was a so awesome heel move that I clapped 




 TNA Friday Nights on the WWE Network! 




 Kayfabe wise, true. but in reality Sami is far from healed, and he needs a storyline rest. They already lost Hideo so they can't lost him in the main event, especially after weeks of anticipation. EVERYONE wanted to see this main event. And WWE gave it. I have no complaint 




 The ending makes sense non-Kayfabe wise

Sami is certainly still working injured. He needs a longer off time and in the meantime, they need another top level face since Hideo is also out for 8 to 6 months. They have already plans for Uhaa to debut slowly, so why not get one of the most hottest property right now to debut and take over Zayn/Hideo's role?

This is awesome 




 Might be like KENTA when he first came. They changed the name later 




 I just realised that WWE uses a different Kanji for Hideo. Hideo uses  (Eiyu - Hero) as his twitter handle. WWE uses  instead for the shirt 




 I'd be more happier if they keep the DRS as in real life, AKA there are sections and special event before you can trigger the DRS. Makes no sense when everyone can use DRS on every straight as it takes out the real use of DRS

Also does anybody notice the animation for DRS is wonky? Some cars have DRS open mid corners, while at Catalunya the animation does not work at all, showing the DRS is open permanently 




 The 458 Italia is actually recognised in windows as an XboX 360 Controller. Try plugging it in a friend's PC and see if that works?

Also check out Devices and Printers 




 Monza, Le Mans and Nordchleife has long straights. Just need to have a good exit at the corner beforehand to reach maximum speed 




 Took me a while after RAW finished to realised neither were there.  




 Thank you! They should have made it more clear tho :/ 




 Was wondering if this can be done. Currently when you create a pit strategy you MUST take in fuel. This means for short sprint races where you just want to fix something and change tyres, waiting for fuel makes no sense. 




 Force feedback is broken, and now it feels twitchy and oversteery 




 They have an agreement with Full Sail to teach students using NXT about TV production. So the once a month taping at Full Sail is there to stay 




 won't be that bad. Remember, NXT tapes a month of matches in advance 




 clicked on the ippv page but its in spanish. on my phone now but how much would the ippv cost? 




 Hamilton should have been a winger

Weird that he does not join this after his Arsenal vs Sky match 




 Kinda
He thought i hit him from behind so i told him to save the replay 




 We both underestimated that corner. talking to him after the race, he thought I was behind, and not beside him, hence the door closing quickly.  




 Yes.  









 Combined pedals means that the game detect your pedal and brakes as one X axis controller, with the fuel +X and the brakes -X.

This means that you can't really press them both at the same time as only one is detected. This is actually a patch for old games that can't detect fuel and brakes as separate controls 




 Considering that 230ish = 370KM/h which F1 cars could only acheive at Monza but rarely, I'm amazed they are complaining the cars are still slow 




 http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/michaelschumacher_ferrari_spafrancorchamps_1996.jpg

They did circa 95/96, but the side impact rule + HANS + Front nose being made not to ride up the side of the car in a T Bone collision + drivers complaining they can't see when a car is beside them has the head rest lowered.

 Bathurst too  has this pit exit bug 




 If you notice that McLaren has a grudge on me since the first corner up to the hairpin where he took me out  




 No worries man. I actually find this funny. If you see what I was doing was holding back and still I got spun out  









 Started following F1 when it was held in Malaysia in 99. While technically the internet exist, it's still in it's infancy and you have to go to a cybercafe to use it, which is costly to me. 

Thankfully every Sunday there is a cars special slip out section in our newspapers, and Mobil One sponsors a 10 page F1 spreadout in  it. So I collected that. And since Mobil One sponsors McLaren, it also has special features on Mika and DC

I remember watching races delayed, and I would turn off all radio and TV news before watching them.  




 The noise in your image shows that 

1 - Auto ISO bumped to max

2 - Rather slow shutter speed

3 - WWE does the opposite for their broadcast

It's not that bright, but it's not as dark as what WWE is showing in TV either.  




 Wary, unless you mean you always need to be tired and sluggish around him 




 PC only tho :/ 




 The control mapping option was created with the PC in mind (remember, it was supposed to be a PC only game) which with the keyboard, you have a lot of keys to assign these functions to. 

Sadly you need to sacrifice some other functions if you are using a controller, unless it allows it to be mapped to a connected keyboard? 




 I am in Asia but I changed my region to either London or Manchester. Lots of Europeans. Note that weekends would be full of new drivers that might be too aggressive in defending

 The Authority will be around at least until the next WM where likely Rock and Rousey puts an end to them. so yeah, happy days are here again 




 I'm convinced that's Kimi doing commentary 




 Also by editing the configuration files you can even race with the safety car. Awesome stuffs 




 A lot of games have the same game/physics engine by ISI. rFactor, rFactor 2, GTR, GTR2, the Brazillian based Stock Car Extreme and even NFS Shift 1 and NFS Shift 2.
