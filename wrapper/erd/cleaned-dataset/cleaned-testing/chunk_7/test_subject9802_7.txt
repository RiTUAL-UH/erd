 Haha, I thought the same but no, they just also happen to be dwarves, I believe.  




 Haha, yeah I feel like they made a lot of similar calls like that in the movie :) 




 [Like this, perhaps?](http://youtu.be/jItz-uNjoZA)

 Cool! I love painting cats! Yellow eyes or green eyes? 




 I'm so sorry to hear about your friend and his nephew! I can't help with money becaus I, too am in a rut but i'm happy to write a letter to the family with my sympathies, though! I hope you're okay, too- I'm sorry you're all going through this :( 




 Thank you SO much! Is there anything I can do for you?? 




 Thank you! Is there anything I can make for you??? 




 Thank you! You are very sweet :') 




 Thank you so much! What would you like created for you? Literally anything you want! 




 That's more than I could ever expect! Do you want any art or a thank you note with a sketch? 




 Thank you so much! That's more than I could ever expect from a generous stranger! Do you want a drawing or a thankyou note? 




 It's everydayshea at gmail dot com... It's vaguely mentioned on one of my screencaps. Sorry I didn't make it clear :-/ 




 Thank you so much! Everyone's been so kind and I've already teared up so many times today. You're awesome; your kind words mean so much to me. 3 




 That sounds amazing! Let's do it :) 




 Sure, let's do it! 




 Perfect. What days work for you, usually? I'm out of work at the very least until thursday still.. maybe longer so I have time besides the odd favors I'll do for friends in order to keep myself from going crazy or in exchange for a meal. I like cooking lots of things so you tell me whatever your favorite dish is and I'm happy to cook it! Feel free to PM me any time whenever you know what days work for you. 3 




 Thank you so much! Is there anything I can do for you in terms or art/a letter/a sketch??? I will definitely pay it forward. The funny thing is I try to do RAoK's as often as possible in hopes that good karma will be infectious to others. I can't thank you enough. :') 




 That's very sweet of you! How about I cook for you if you pick up the ingredients? :) 




 Oh gosh, I didn't realize... Fixed. Thank you! What can I do for you??? 




 I do not... I'm actually asking reddit because I'm too ashamed to let my colleagues and my boyfriend know I need help. It's a psychological crutch; I was abused growing up and made to feel like I didn't deserve anyone's help and that it's shameful to admit you need it. I don't know why, but auctioning my art to strangers feels so much emotionally safer. I have a paypal account, but I don't even know how to set up a gofundme... Maybe I'm just being pathetic. I also unloaded a LOT of info on my thread and I don't want to inundate anyone any more than I already have... 

Thank you so much for your kind words, though. I've been struggling for months and now with the health issues, it's all kind of bubbled over.  




 I just made one. I don't want to seem greedy so these are the most important things I could think of to help me get by...

 I do not, but I can make a new one! That one was on paper but I can do it on a clay aquaboard for better presentation if you want... Or I can do paper and frame it in a goodwill frame for you. 




 The trees with the stars are sold but I can make another similar yet different one. I can attempt nautical stuff... I love drawing sperm whales, squids, octopus, nautulus, etc... I will PM you. 




 No... I don't really need stuff. Cat food and litter, I guess, or winter shoes but I can figure out how to make one. I guess new paints so I can keep selling art wouldn't hurt but I don't want to be greedy. I'm not used to asking for help. 




 Aww I love cavaliers! Poor little thing, she looks so sad! Hope she heals up quickly 3 




 I can give you the bird; that one I still have! I stupidly cleaned off the spilling because I was being hard on myself and ended up making it have an orange background.. You are welcome to have it anyway, though. Other than that I can make you a cat if you'd prefer! I gifted the fat cat to an old room mate for holding onto a sentimental piece of furniture that I sold years back but I love drawing cats and am always happy to do more :) 




 We can meet up but I will probably be an embarrassed lump of sorry's and thank-you's and tears. When I'm confident I'm a good conversationalist and friend but when I'm embarrassed and mad at myself I can be a little pathetic. I'd love to meet a new friend, even if it means getting out of the house for a walk and cat food... I guess I just didn't expect anyone to respond. I'll pm you... You are a sweetheart. 




 Also, what is your favorite animal? If we do meet up it want to have something for you...  




 How flexible are your hours? You can always try volunteering on an organic farm in exchange for a free place to stay and three meals... The only thing is it depends on whether you can handle it. Most farms ask for 5 days/5 hour commitment... You can check out WOOFING (worldwide opportunities on organic farms) to see what might work for you! Otherwise, couchsurfing or air bnb may be good starts... Good luck :) 




 I don't even know how to ask for it. I made this at 4am. I guess the most important thing I honestly need is cat food and cat litter right now. I'm more worried about taking care of him than myself. I still have some ramen packets I can get by on for a bit. Gosh I'm embarrassed. 




 This made me cry. We need more kindhearted, patient people in this world. Even just making eye contact and smiling at your bus driver or a passerby might make their day even an iota brighter.  




 This breaks my heart :(  
OP you should have joined him... 




 Well good luck! I am a terrible night owl and I used to work at a coffee shop at 5am; sometimes I wouldn't go to bed until 2am only to wakeup at 4... Woof. Do you work at a grocery store or something? 




 Thank you so much! Do you have a favorite animal?  

Also, thank you for all the hard work you do. I hated my social worker when I was a ward of the state, but I recognize how overworked and under appreciated social workers are. Thank you for even choosing/attempting that career path. Try not to burn out; you may change someone's life more profoundly than they care to admit. 




 Voted. Good luck!! 




 **Edit:** I feel like I've received enough kindness from the wonderful users of reddit to close this. Thank you to every kind person who donated, offered advice, kind words, or commissioned me. I'm currently working on art for all of the redditors who donated/comissioned. I will be PMing you all directly with a photo of the progress/finished piece and we'll work out how to get in in your hands directly!   

For anyone curious, [here is my art on tumblr](http://faunus-crypticus.tumblr.com). I'm always happy to take commissions or barter; just keep in mind I have about 4 out 5 paintings that need to be finished first, so it may take a few days - week before I can take on anything new.  

**Thanks again to everyone; I plan on paying it forward as often as I can in any way, shape or form. You all have touched me very profoundly with your kindness.

 Fellow night owl here. How did your sleep adjustment go? 




 I'm in southie fairly often and will keep my eyes out. I saw the posters by Broadway. Good luck, I know how stressful a missing kitty is! 




 Oh look, it's real life Ricky from trailer park boys! 




 Wow I totally forgot about that ad! 




 I always feel so bad for Australian Santas. It's gotta be so fucking hot in that outfit. 




 [I made this song my alarm clock. I never fail to JUMP OUT OF MY SKIN to shut it off...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2QHqmZdGnI) 




 Wow, that's a pretty depressing song to hear at a job like subway...  
*"So no one told you life was gonna be this way;  
your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's DOA"* 




 No idea but it's getting to be really old. People felt "betrayed" by the beloved Unidan. 




 Jeez, 10 is a LOT when tipping isn't a common practice, too! 




 Worked every time for me, but you really need to genuinely mean it:   
"I don't need this job, I like my current job and am comfortable enough there; I just really want to work for this company" 




 Quit being butthurt, get over the whole Unidan thing and move on. 




 I work at a bar as a cocktail waitress and one thing I absolutely **hate** is when coworkers complain about their tables/tips/etc... You have *one job* and you can't at least keep a good attitude? Just because you aren't always a bitch to the tables doesn't mean we want to hear you bitching. It's just gonna make your own day worse anyway.  




 [Got the movie it's sourced from right here :D](http://youtu.be/FRoAz5eT1HA) 




 Brilliantly done! So clean! 









 What did you say to the guy after he bit you? I'm curious how your reacted! 




 Oh my god!!! I love this, haha. He looks so beaten down by life.  
*"I don't know, man... I've... I've seen some shit."*  
Thank you so much! 




 I'm surrounded by assholes! 




 Just watched that movie a few nights ago! It's a classic! :)
