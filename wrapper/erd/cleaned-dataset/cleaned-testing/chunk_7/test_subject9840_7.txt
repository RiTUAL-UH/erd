 If I need help I much prefer Mitre 10. The one near me actually hired an ex-plumber in the plumbing section. Also once I needed a gift for my dad for fathers day and got a suggestion - it was the only gift I've ever given dad that I think he's actually wanted, despite all my best efforts. 




 eBay if you can. It's cheaper and they're often better than store costumes. But you need time for the delivery... that's the only problem.  




 One option might be to find a Butcher that can order it for you. 

I have usually found a good variety of meats at Peters Meats in Broadway. You could try giving them a call and asking them if they can order it in for you.

You could also try asking this Scottish place (in Maroubra btw,  not in the Hills) if they sell it or know where to get it:

 In Australia eggs are often located on non refrigerated shelves at supermarkets but when I get home I always put them in the fridge.

Australia sits somewhere between US and European standards. We wash our eggs but they sometimes are and sometimes aren't sold from the fridge in the supermarket. Most people I know do put them in the fridge once home though like I do. 

[See here](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/should-you-refrigerate-eggs-in-australia-2014-7) 

The processing process in Australia is shown on page 6 [here](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t source=web rct=j q=Australia%20egg%20washed ei=dLQeVdHEFMHe8AXGtYCIDA url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/code/primaryproduction/egg/documents/Eggs_healthandsafety.pdf ved=0CB8QFjAB usg=AFQjCNFfMLYdgk38K3YFJ71kHs7D8kRqNA )
 




 If you're a good looking lady you almost always get to choose. 




 That's obviously going to vary as countries raise and lower interest rates.  




 I'm a resident overseas and have accounts overseas already. I'm not too worried. I'll spread my eggs around in different baskets to hedge my bets. 




 Sounds good to me. Thanks! :)  




 I wonder if you can get your wages deposited into an overseas account. Anyone know? 




 I just Googled it and found this photo of baby Emus on the beach!:
https://malpassadventures.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/dsc_0058.jpg

Will sign! I want to see beach Emus one day.  




 I catch buses and don't use the opal card. If you do use the opal card just make sure you tap off when you get off.  




 A lot of native flowers are usually pretty expensive. I'd go to the market and make my own bouquet. You have to wake up early though but they are also really fresh. 

If you want a good floral arrangement from a good florist you usually have to order them in advance. 

I know a few good places but none in or near those particular areas unfortunately. There used to be a florist at the international airport arrivals terminal but I think it is gone now. 

Pearsons florist at Broadway used to be good but they are renovating their store at the moment. I think they have quite a few stores around Sydney. Just be warned,  they're pretty expensive but they do very nice bouquets. 




 I've had my kmart one for a couple of years. It still works fine including the pedal, though doesn't look as good as it used to. Still does the job though. I don't value the bin enough to spend a lot of money on it. 




 I fed these guys once and ended up with my balcony covered in bird poo. That was the last time. 




 Tafe at Ultimo is pretty good and cheaper than the unis. Good if you want to go after work.  




 I think there are quite a few kids at jenolan caves though. I went in school holidays and they sell the tours out for hours in advance so I'd recommend if you go get the tickets first and walk around the pretty lake while you wait for your cave tour. 




 I haven't seen any in Sydney... wild. Even if they were it'd be hard to spot them. They're not exactly noisy! I was on Magnetic Island and it was hot so stopped to put sun cream on for like ten minutes. Just as I was going to leave I heard a small rustling noise. Directly above me was a small koala. Must have been a juvenile. It woke up for about 30 seconds and moved to a different fork in the tree then went back to sleep. 

I'd say your best bet near Sydney is a wildlife park or zoo.  




 :( I am worried for my teeth too. I wish I was a shark and could regrow them. 




 But... where *are* the pedals?  




 If you ask a friend or acquaintance I'm sure they'd help you out. I'd let my deprived friends use my Internet! 

If you have no friends you can try cafes but they'll be noisy. I personally wouldn't want to do an interview in one.  But if you must... Well Connected Cafe in Glebe has free wifi. It's not 24 hrs but it's got longish hours. 

There are also Internet/gaming cafes like city hunter. You could give them a call and ask if you can use Skype but they would have headsets for gaming. Sorry been ages since I've been there. Not sure if it's noisy there but you could check it out anyway.

I reckon buying 4G would be the way to go as well. 




 If you're lucky you can see them in the city. 

For the longest time I thought someone was using a clothes dryer at night... and it always puzzled me why at that hour they would do their laundry. It turns out it was a tawny frogmouth. They make a weird continuous hoot. After hearing this sound for over 5 years I finally saw them a couple of months ago. I saw 3 in the space of about two weeks. So cool. They hang by the creek. 

Although tawny frogmouths aren't technically owls, they're nightjars so I suppose I haven't really seen an owl.

But yeah if you want to see them, you'll have to listen carefully. When you're close they are very quiet and difficult to spot unless they fly in front of you. But it happens! At least you will know from listening if they are in your area. 




 Maybe having the ticket is your chance to make friends with someone who will go with you. 

Or you could go by yourself. I do lots of stuff by myself. It's not as bad as it seems. The animals don't mind :) 




 That's the weirdest part of the whole thing. Especially late at night. Who cares? 

Anyway if it makes the OP feel any better, I live in the city. Road abuse is a normal thing for me and has no effect on me anymore. Just lock your doors, wind up the windows and turn up the music.  




 Redfern. But only if you get off and on the right carriages.  




 I've been looking for 2 years. Whatever the price guide is we usually add $200-300k and it ends up closer to what it will actually go for. It helps reduce our disappointment a bit at auction. But it's still crap. Every time we figure out what the price should be it defies our expectations the next month. It's horribly disheartening and makes me lose faith. 




 I'd leave Sydney if there were decent jobs elsewhere. How do we get businesses to move to other cities? Surely people would be interested in living somewhere with affordable housing closer to work.  




 Thanks! :)  




 OP has obviously already done it. Why would I do it again? 




 How do you make it show the locations? 




 Where is this map from? I need some suburbs further south! 




 Can you do Australian Fauna now and Carnivores later? That would be cool to do both.

Food poisoning sucks. Has the vomiting stopped? I paid a lot for a fancy hotel overseas once and spent the night on towels on the bathroom floor vomiting all night. I had to get a foreign doctor to give me a needle to stop it. But only after almost 24 hours. :/ He said any longer and I'd be in hospital.  




 I just realized how old I am. I used to use one of these at work.  




 I had a pet dwarf rabbit when I was a kid and the cat got it and killed it. I smacked the cat to try to make it drop it but I couldn't make it drop it without hurting the cat, and I didn't want to break it's jaw. The dog was barking, it was chaos, but the cat just hung tight until it was dead. Worst pet combo ever. Now, I wouldn't ever keep a cat with an animal that could be it's prey. We got mice for pets once, that drove the cat insane. The cat would refuse to eat anything else until it got the mice. One day I came home and the cat had knocked the cage over and broken it. Weird thing is that cat was so gentle with humans - no scratching or biting or anything, just cute and cuddly. 




 I got an air purifier the other day and I farted near it. Poor thing went into hyper drive. :(  




 Oh yeah whoops. I didn't notice the time :) 




 Aren't people who are cruel to animals often sociopaths? If so then they may be more likely to have a record.  




 During the gun buyback after guns were outlawed there were quite a few individuals who exploited the fact that people willingly handed over their guns. They often had someone file down the numbers and then redistribute them to criminals for a price. If you Google it you will find quite a few news stories about those who were caught. Many of the illegal guns in Australia are still in circulation due to criminals like this who profited greatly at the cost of others. 

For example:
http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/record-jail-term-for-gun-plot/2007/02/21/1171733835420.html?page=fullpage 




 Damn you! I was on a diet! 




 Some of these things are totally do-able! What is stopping you all? 




 But soup is humid. I went the other day when it was hot and I was sweating like a pig.  




 When I was in the US I learned they have BB guns and paintball for sale at some of the sports stores. Guess that's how they can host events like the one you mentioned. It's much more regulated here. 




 I thought this must be what happens when you get foxtel.  




 ... and MrAwkwardCrotch's knowledge of lubes. 




 Where do his man parts go? Are they usually that... compactable? 




 It must have been terrifying. I'm glad you made it out of there.  




 Have you fought fires there? Do the trees fall down when there's fires too? 




 Wow, that's pretty nice! How have I lived in Sydney my whole life and not been there?  




 That's a great photo!  




 I see what you mean. I agree with you. It doesn't make sense as an objective question. I think most people get that and answer it subjectively - at least that's what I did. Also I like hearing other people's opinions so I can expand my horizons and knowledge of other nice places.  




 Actually I would prefer if Australia was a Republic and that particular point has nothing to do with my choices.  




 Can other people not from the US/Canada who haven't lived in these two countries for any period of time tell the difference between these accents? Sometimes I feel like I can when I am there, but then I get all confused, especially when there are so many different American accents. 




 "America has contributed nothing positive to society or the world."

I don't believe this at all, but I do think it would piss most Americans off. 




 What sort of person would you describe if you were to try to explain what "most" Americans are like? I've always found this hard because America has quite a lot of diversity.   




 There are plenty of other things that need the world's attention, those are the things we are often trying to escape by considering living in countries that have less things that need the world's attention. 

So on a global level we should care about other things, but on a personal level we want the best we can get, so this is entirely relevant to us as individuals.  




 I haven't been there so I can't really put it on my top list as I don't know a lot about it. I like natural features, so it has to have that to be on the best country list. Do you know if they have anything like that?

I loved the Republic of Ireland but feel that it's too economically unstable to live for a full lifetime. Also I have never been to a country that has so little racial diversity as Ireland, and I would miss it.  




 I would say Canada, Australia, New Zealand. I can't choose one.

Edit: Clearly this is subjective.  




 I had this same thing happen to me! I was running late for an appointment with a specialist and I told the guy and he yelled insults at me about being a selfish bitch. Honestly though, it's water off a duck's back. I do my bit.  




 I didn't know that but I always have donated directly. I tell them up front that I only donate online so they don't hassle me. I'm not giving some stranger on the street my credit card details... 




 I'm pretty sure my cat would have pulled this off in less than 30 seconds. 




 I drink Gatorade when I'm doing sport, but if you just want to rehydrate without the sugars, you can have electrolyte rehydration tables. Not sure what they're called in the US but in Australia they're called Hydralyte and Gastrolyte. They are good if you are dehydrated and need to encourage your body to absorb the water without all the extra sugars that are in some of the sports drinks like Gatorade and Powerade.

Energy drinks are not used for the purposes of rehydration, and they taste terrible. I don't know how anyone can stand the sweetness.  




 I'm really glad I read this thread for this comment. I didn't know they were bad. We were using them in the bathroom to rid it of the poo smells (our bathroom doesn't have windows or a fan), but now I will be careful what I burn! 




 I think we do know this is unhealthy, we just have difficulty doing much about it. :(

 I love how you saved something that might otherwise have ended up in the trash. It looks lovely too. I can see this is a proud part of your kitchen. 




 Yeah, sometimes I kind of cringe when he's handling the animals. Not because he's going to hurt them, more that I think he'll get hurt because he's shaking them around probably aggravating them. I'm surprised he's not bitten more often. Shows you that most Australian animals (goannas and crocs excluded) although potential deadly are usually pretty non-confrontational.  




 Don't worry he never hurts any of them.

He mostly picks up snakes. E.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at0efMXfCnc 




 Aw poor little things. But they are so cute so they have that going for them.  




 That's interesting - why is there an exception for axolotl's? 

 




 Yeah, it is. :( Stupid cars!  




 'cause they're super cool? :)

My favourite Australian lizard aside from the blue tongue is the frill-neck lizard. When I was in primary school I saw my first real one in the playground and it was the coolest thing ever! It was scared so it frilled up and had a stand off with about twenty 7 year olds all staring in awe. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frill-necked_lizard
 




 Sort of - like, not really rare, but definitely uncommon. You need a reptile license to own any type of snake or reptile in New South Wales (and I think maybe that's the case for all of Australia but I'm not 100% sure). You can't really just walk into a normal pet store and buy them, but I suppose some people do keep them.
http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/wildlifelicences/ReptileKeepersLicence.htm

I used to have a blue tongue lizard living in the backyard so never really thought about owning one. One day I came home and it was sitting in the gutter under our front door and I screamed thinking it was a snake, but it was just having a rest. :) 




 You might like this video then... First guy to get the iPhone 6 in Perth:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA135pd7oD0 




 I don't know if you've heard of him - David Ireland, Wildlife Man - but he always loves to pick animals up that don't want to be picked up and while he's talking he flails them about in the air.  

He did this with a Shingleback and it was so angry at him. When he put it down it didn't really try to run away it just looked at him like it was evaluating it's options on how exactly it was going to take his life. I tried to find the video on youtube but I can't find it. :( 




 I think it's a [Shingleback Lizard](http://australianmuseum.net.au/shingleback-lizard) from Australia! 

There is a little doco here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPZiAiUYS8o

The main feature is that the tail looks like a head - to confuse predators. 




 Ah I knew it was missing something! I have rectified this tragic mistake! 




 Maybe he saw the wallet and couldn't believe his luck. As he walked home he pondered what he could do with it. He could take a well-earned holiday. He could upgrade his worn out car that forced him onto public transport to a nice new car. He could pay off a bit of the mortgage. When he got home he realised that there were a mountain of bills piled up on the table and so he quickly went about using the money to pay them all off. 

The moment he was finished he sighed a big sigh of relief. But as the night went on he couldn't stop thinking about the person who lost the money. Who were they? Why did they need that much cash? At first he dismissed the idea with thoughts that they were probably drug dealers and so by keeping the money he was actually helping to keep drugs off the street. For a day or two he tried to convince himself that that was the case. After the second day the thought popped into his head that maybe this was money that had been saved up by an elderly person and this was their retirement fund. What if children had visited him from two different countries and provided urgently needed help? Imagine, being 80 years old and the money to sustain you was in that envelope. For days he wrestled with the idea until he came to the conclusion that he would never know. This is what really chewed him up inside. What if his act of keeping the money was now causing someone else's deprivation? His conscience couldn't bear it. 

He realised that there was only one solution and that was to give the money back. But he'd already spent almost $8000 of it. He felt so selfish. He didn't want to go to the police with the remaining money only to be found out if they did locate the original owner that he'd taken a cut for himself. He considered lying and saying that's all he found in the envelope, but he didn't want to risk it. So he decided he would save up the money and return it to the police. He calculated he could do this in about 2 months.

Two months went by and he was making good progress, but his dog got sick so he had to take him to the vet, which cost him another good chunk of the money. 

Finally after several months he had earnt all the money back and put it in the envelope and turned it into the police. He was relieved. His conscience was clear, and he could resume his life before finding the wad of cash. 

As he walked home he noticed a brand new looking lottery ticket blowing in the wind. If I win it's fate he thought! Karma for my good deeds! He got home and as all the numbers were being announced he slowly began to realise he had won! $23,000 exactly. :)

* Edit: 

And then out of nowhere a heavy knock at the door... Without thinking he opened the door and there before him was Nessy the lochness monster. She explained that she was lost and was trying to get home to Scotland, and she needed treefiddy to make a phonecall. The man retrieved the money at which point Nessy started crying, explaining that it was such a lonely place in Scotland. The man's heart went out to the creature - he himself only had a pet dog whose health had recently taken a turn for the worse. He asked Nessy if she wanted to come to stay with him, as he had a large backyard pool, though he apologised that the water was no longer a clear blue, rather a murky brown, as you see he had no friends to share it with and let it go. Nessy squealed with delight! A brown murky pool was just perfect! They agreed, and the two mystical creatures lived out their days in the quiet suburbs of Sydney. 




 That's good. Those guys are like sharks. When I was younger there was a tow truck driver pouring oil on the road to cause accidents and of course he'd be the first on the scene. So since then I have never trusted them.

 I don't know :( I've never been cool enough to take up smoking. I was in Aspen, Colorado and the e-cigs are everywhere - mostly older people. Apparently it's the thing to do there.  




 This makes the most sense. I think they are more likely to pick up e-cigs. They look much cooler. 




 You're amazing :) 




 Thanks for the gold! :) I have never had gold before. I feel so special!  




 Maybe it is also just trying to enjoy a nice evening! 

I just looked it up and apparently slugs are attracted to wine!:

 Unlike Virgin, they go all the way... which way exactly though, they aren't too sure about. 




 They're building one of the biggest in Queensland! Hopefully the government can just keep their shit together for long enough to see the benefits.

 I loved my cat too... she was the best. I miss her so much. 

Some people suck, but there are a lot of good people too. But the terrible things people do overwhelms me sometimes. When that happens, I just think about building my own little island in the world and sometimes I travel to other places and interact with people, but then I try to come back to my own island where I try to create the world that I want to live in, and that includes making the world better for other people. I don't think island is the right word, but I really mean my section of the world, where I can mould it to be how I want it. I like that I can possibly make a difference in my little part of the world. Like a little oasis. 
 




 I think it's good seeing someone about it. Sometimes I get stuck in circles like being sucked down a whirlpool and it is like a hand reaching down and pulling me out of it. I hope you find it helpful too. I don't think I will ever be 'cured' but I hope to live a full life anyway. 

I don't need to be happy all the time, sadness is a part of life, but I don't want to be miserable all the time. 

How do I connect with Eeyore? I wouldn't mind. I should sleep too. :) 

Btw, it means a lot that you took the time to reply. Thanks. It's my birthday today and now I don't feel alone. :) 




 Hey, this is precision driving! It's hard to get a car into a small parking space like that. 




 It looks like Hobart has been relocated to Flinders Island. 




 That particular Kirin one is pretty yummy! I had half of one today too at lunch with my sushi.  

Mango Raspberry sounds good too. I am going to get that now next time I'm at the shop. 




 I also like the Kirin Cider - the one with "Ume" (Japanese Plum) delights my tastebuds! 




 I'm so glad there is a gym underneath my office. The punching bags there have saved me from imploding.  




 Working full-time is definitely an adjustment. You're going to have to realise you might have to reduce time with friends, e.g. to the weekends. Unless they are work friends or people that work close to your work, in which case you can try to catch up with them for lunch or after work. At my last job, I used to go jogging with friends at lunch, or play sport. We also used to go out drinking most fridays. At my current job I am too busy for that, so it just means a little less socialising. Luckily most of my friends also work full-time so they are in the same boat and get it.  

Some jobs are better than others at having a better work-life balance. It's hard when you're starting out though because you sometimes do have to do longer hours and prove yourself. When you get a chance you can try to find somewhere with a better balance. Once you have experience you will have more bargaining power so that will help.  




 I also studied my last year of uni and worked full time. Things will get easier once you finish the year. Just try to stay on top of things and communicate with your boss if things are getting too much. I tried to power through it but I got really stressed and ended up on sick leave. Remember to try to eat healthy if you can and get enough sleep! It will help, trust me, I learnt the hard way. 




 A year or so ago I told my friend who is a psychologist about how I see someone, and I said that it's good cause I have someone to talk to. I explained I don't talk to my friends about it cause I don't want to burden them with it. She said plainly that she thinks that sometimes you should talk to your friends about things. It was the first time anyone had said that to me and it was one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to me. 

It's just so hard because I had it bad in highschool and always talked about suicide. My best friend from highschool also suffered from depression and last year she committed suicide, and I feel so responsible for talking about it all the time, and I feel like I didn't help and only made it worse for her. 

I still can't talk to friends openly about it. Sometimes I feel so alone.
