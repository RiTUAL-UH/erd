 I misread this as "*James* in the waiting room" and got really confused lol. Clean pair though! 




 I personally wouldn't consider 183 days *near*, but I guess from a statistical standpoint it would make sense. 




 Ya know, I'm not entirely sure myself

 Why does Blaine's face look like the one's who is Photoshopped 




 I LOVE YOU 




 Nope, not that either. Thanks though man 




 I am 100% sure it was Wii and equally sure it was *not* Castle Crashers, as I said the game was First Person. Thanks though! 




 Nada. Thanks though! 




 No, not this either. Thanks! 




 it was a First Person game. Thanks though! 




 December 21^st , 20*15*? 




 No, not that. It was like an actual *game*, with a story and a goal I think. I just know it wasn't Medieval Games. Thanks though 




 I remember playing this game around 5 or 6 years ago or so. It was a medieval-ish cartoon looking game. **First person**, you went around slashing people and stuff like that. 

The colors red and brown stand out to me. [As well as a rope bridge with like wooden logs.] (http://quad-atv.specs-sa.com/Images/berakah/three_meter_bridge_approach.jpg)'

Sorry for the vague description, it was all I could remember. Thanks for any help you can give me!

Edit: Games it is not: Overlord: Dark Legend, Medieval Games, Red Steel 2, or Swordplay Showdown on Wii Sports Resort. 




 Probably just the perspective. I didn't even notice that they looked like that until I read this comment. 




 Yes! Greats is my favourite brand as of now. What is your opinion on the new "Pronto" runner they are coming out with? 




 Hey man, we all start somewhere. Not a bad collection tbh, like the KD VIs the most personally.

In my opinion, the "Alternate" Pack is the best. But in terms of *individual shoes*, I think that the 5 lows from the "Dunk From Above" pack is the best colourway. The contrast in the White/Navy combination with the hints of gold really sell it for me.

What are your opinions? 




 The "downvote" key is for something that doesn't contribute to the conversation at hand. 

Like if I were to just post " A nipple farted in my anus" then it should be downvoted because it doesn't contribute to the conversation. 




 What Dunk colourway, if there is a specific one? 




 How'd you come across this? 




 I like the minimalim to be honest. Might usr it 




 The language be that Chanish

Damn that's a good song.
