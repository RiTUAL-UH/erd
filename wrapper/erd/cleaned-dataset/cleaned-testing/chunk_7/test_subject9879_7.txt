 IMHO Riker's today is much worse than the Alcatraz of yesterday. 




 Just the nonchalance with which the aunty in the first coach gets off. 




 Cool story - knew it before hand. But I hate that asshole Horus. He is a religious extremist and a fanatic, and is directly responsible for most of the filth on defence.pk 




 I call it the House MD syndrome. If you are smart/succesful your asshole nature will be tolerated.

At the end of the day, people tolerate that simply because the asshole is the most productive guy or is the chief rainmaker. That perch however is very unstable - case in point - Jobs himself was once fired from Apple. 




 The solution is to reform archaic labor laws. India remains 138 in the ease of doing business rank. Have you ever tried opening a startup in India, and seen the paperwork involved?

Saner labor laws will create more valued startups - internet dependent companies who can push back against the Mittals and the Ambanis. And finally, the GOI has to invest in fiber optic infrastructure. Even in the US of A, the big ISPs do not care about internet infrastructure, and in fact bribe Republican legislatures to purposefully stymie improvement.

Superfast internet, like that in Chattanooga, TN is municipal broadband, built by taxpayer money, in the understanding that there exists a critical mass of startups that will be attracted and will help pay for the infrastructure investment.

Another critical aspect in India is net neutrality. Nobody gives a shit whether you, as a lone consumer care about net neutrality. You have no *aukaad*. And this is not India specific, but is present in USA too. FCC was able to enforce net neutrality, because Obama had their back, who gets big donations from Silicon Valley. And even then, the Republican Party is trying tooth and nail to repeal it - including defunding the FCC. Do you think net neutrality happened in USA because the consumers demanded it? Dream on. It happened because there are internet dependent companies whose valuations rival, and exceed AT T and Comcast, and who can outlobby the ISPs. 




 You need a critical liberal sanctuary. One of the oft-criticized aspect about US politics is that how much liberalism/conservatism differs from state to state. As an Indian who grew up in India, and who has been in the USA for quite some time now - this similar blue/red divides do not exist as much in India. Sure, UP, Bihar and Haryana are uber retrogressive, but really liberal states do not exist in India. Bengal was once such a state, but decades of misrule has significantly hardened the population there. 

The most obvious pathway is for one state to first legalize it. To be India's Massachusetts and Hawaii. My bet is that it will be one of the Northeastern states. The answer is probably Tripura, or Sikkim. They are liberal, but are not majority Christian so that there will not be significant Church pushback. This will happen in 2018. For a few years after that, the Supreme Court will punt on the issue, while entitled morons will harass NE people in Delhi as *gay ch####*.

There will be blowback to that in the form of renewed secessionist action (not so much for Sikkim, definitely for Tripura.) 

In 2024, we have now a critical choice ahead of us. The GOI may act really foolishly by redoubling its Army efforts, or use its brain once and try confronting the inherent racism in Indians. If it follows the second mature route - things may calm down, and you may see movies coming that focus on LGBT rights, around 2025 onwards.

The first few ones will definitely be offensive, but at least they will start a conversation. And we need the first few ones to be a bit offensive and to play for the gallery for cheap laughs. Because remember, if the movie is too progressive for its own good some moron will file a vulgarity complaint against the movie for crap like corrupting morals and such - and some jobless judge will hear that case. And obviously this is India, there will be no shortage of paid trolls to burn down a theater or two. Remember, college kids will always torrent the movie and will watch and appreciate it - but that's not the point. We want aunties and uncles to watch it, and the conversation to be planted there.

Then may come some better movies around 2028 along with a patronizing Satyamev Jayate episode and a cheeky Amul ad. Some High Courts will move towards legalization, notably West Bengal (assuming Mamata loses), and Delhi (assuming AAP stays) and Goa. The Supreme Court will still punt, while both BJP and Congress will pass the ball along.

Around 2030, a critical mass of states will vote yes, and around 2031 the case will reach Supreme Court. Of course Haryana, UP, Bihar and the Mahakhap Panchayat is still vehemently opposed.
Then, on 17th December 2032, as /u/prawn_account stated the Supreme Court will legalize it - narrowly, briefly achieving complete and unanimous religious solidarity in India. 
 
The fight then begins. 




 You just described my grad school experience till now. I have now cut back on quite a few projects, and am better at doing a cost-benefit analysis. And oh yes, I now understand fully my advisers' saying, "If your work does not lead directly to a publication, don't do it." 




 Going on in Kansas too as we speak. 




 Do you do this for free, or get paid for this? 




 Link please? 




 That's all *chunauti jumla*. 




 Do you have any contact with sympathetic professors in your old grad school? A recommendation explaining the situation from their side would do wonders.

 The original Sanskrit term is *meghbarna* and *neelmeghshyam* - literally the color of dark clouds. However, the first appearance of a blue Krishna is pretty widespread - as in from [Raja Ravi Varma](http://www.spiritualbee.com/media/lord-krishna.jpg) and [Rajasthani miniature paintings](http://www.dollsofindia.com/dollsofindiaimages/paintings4/miniature_painting_AP37_l.jpg).
