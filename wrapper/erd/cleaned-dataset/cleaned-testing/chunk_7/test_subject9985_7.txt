 You have a completely valid point. But a good reason not to write God off is that it can be comforting to think that maybe there's more to life than what we immediately realise. Even if it's a lie that I tell myself, it's a harmless lie that only serves to make me happier. I understand that this is illogical and understand why many people can't make the same decision I have, but it works for me. 




 So I haven't switched to the complete polar opposite view, but I used to completely write off the existence of a God. Now I feel more agnostic about things - maybe there is a God, we have no idea what forms, limitations and capabilities a God could potentially have. 




 Not getting wound up by the little things. Annoyed at that customer who moaned at you? Fair enough, but don't let them colour your mood for the rest of the day. 




 Schoolgirls 




 I think Americans do this as sport. 




 If that is genuinely the case, then great. But that's a very easy thing to kid yourself into believing whilst you're in a relationship, after breaking up you often get a whole new perspective.  




 Well wait a second there, selfless and loving is a great thing and all, but letting yourself be walked all over most definitely is not. Not everyone is worthy of unconditional positive regard and a cheater certainly isn't.  




 I joined Toastmasters (a public speaking club). When someone stands up to talk in front of a room of people I feel it's like putting magnifying glass up to their social skills - you quickly learn what you need to improve on. For me it was eye contact, improving this has made a huge difference for me! 




 Condoms. They last for years anyway and it turns out my personality is much more effective. 




 Once you read the mindset of some of the guys on that sub you can see they've gone too far. Instead of excessive masturbation, they end up defining their life by non-masturbation and letting it affect everything they do. 




 If Curiosity was being covertly observed by martians they would have lost their shit when this happened. Hundreds of scientific papers would be published attempting to explain this lonely tune, which is ultimately meaningless.

Maybe the "wow" signal was just some alien celebrating his birthday. 




 I can't comment on the scientific side of this, but anecdotally I have been in an almost identical situation before. I found it much easier to gain the muscle back, but a lot of that came from the belief that I could achieve my goal as I had done so once before. 




 These ducks are on my uni campus and look so cool. Unfortunately the image is shopped so the real ones will just look disappointing to you now. 




 Oh God that reminds me of myspace profiles so much. "I'm so random LOL deal with it!!!!1!11!!" 




 Hey Joe 




 This isn't a life pro tip but rather a "You're being an idiot and don't realise it". Unfortunately it's one of those things that way too many people do.
