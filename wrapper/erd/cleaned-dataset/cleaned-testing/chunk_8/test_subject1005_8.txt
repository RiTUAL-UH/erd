 Oh sorry. Bovada tournies. Real cash.  




 It is insane though because they will be all in with still half their stack. It isn't as if they're down to 4 BBs. They will still have a lot of chips to play with but shove every.single.time. 




 A player will only lose half their starting chips in a hand, and the next hand they shove pre-flop. Why is this such a common thing? 









 If only we were as wise as you.  




 At the end of the day, it remains speculation until we know for sure AND you're right, it all leads to Christ's return anyway. But I wouldn't say it's not worth wondering about. God included it in His Word for a reason, you know? 




 I know different sects of Christianity carry separate opinions on who or what the Anti-Christ and False Prophet are, but I was curious to hear some separate ideas. This post was inspired by another this morning concerning the End of Times. So, in being respectful with each others' views, what is your take or interpretation? 




 So is the one posting against their trash talk. What's your point? 




 Yeah, I suppose that's true. You wouldn't catch any of these guys flapping their gums in a live game.  




 Fair enough. 




 I don't know if people are genuinely unable to hold their tongue or if it is an attempt to tilt players, but the amount of name-calling and insulting is astounding. Anyone have any insight into the major motivation of trash talk? Or, if you talk trash yourself, why do you do it? 




 Look, I know I am in the minority on this one, but there is such a thing as too much Chris Pratt, and I'm concerned its already gotten to that point.  




 The Blurr belongs to Butch.  




 Can you elaborate? haha All I know now is that you don't like VV.  




 Your all-time favorite movie just got remade. What is your worst nightmare about this hypothetical remake? 




 White Horse Inn subscriber here. I love their discussions on Moralistic Therapeutic Deism. 




 I really love that Ben Wade in '3:10 to Yuma' was able to recite the Bible like it was nothing, despite being a murderer, thief and even admitting to be 'rotten as hell.' What're yours? 




 That blooper where the turn around to huddle and immediately lose it kills me.  




 Watching Hugh Jackman get a BJ in Swordfish next to my mom in the theater. So. Much. FUN! 




 You watch too many movies.  




 This is most overused post in this sub. Does that help? 




 I remember renting Weekend at Bernies. Like vividly. Good days.  




 I think this is a pretty solid analyses. The shaky cam didn't bother me so much, and probably wouldn't have even thought to mention it, but different strokes.  




 May I ask what passage leads someone to that interpretation?  




 I would speak to a pastor about this issue. Jesus calls it adultery, but then so is looking at a woman with impure thoughts. Who isn't guilty of that? I would say if she is a believer, you're probably okay, but seek wisdom through prayer and the council of wiser men than myself.  




 Hey Bill welcome back! 




 Who's this fat man then, eh? Eh? 




 Okay, I completely understand the point you're making and you're 100% correct, but you don't actually believe Dances with Wolves is anything like Last of the Mohicans, right?
 




 Or a server in NYC is able to afford a 3-bedroom apartment. Yeeeeeah.
