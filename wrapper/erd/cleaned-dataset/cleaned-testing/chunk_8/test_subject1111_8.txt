 Was that with or without the helium?

 Good post. Fancy repeating for Lewis's wins? 




 What elephant? 




 In the UK there have been multiple, upheld court cases where drivers have been prosecuted for crossing red lights (by automated cameras) to let through emergency services vehicles. 

Not our finest hour, and I'm sad to say that if I'm at the front of a set of lights with a camera and the choice is sit tight or get a ticket, I'm turning the radio up a notch... :-/

(I'm so, so sorry that this is a Daily Heil article :( ) 




 The first year can be tough, but I promise you that you won't regret it, even for a moment! 




 Sorry, I disagree. This quote:
 "If we don't have a competitive engine in the near future, then either Audi is coming or we are out," said Marko.

...is pretty inflammatory and doesn't really need a whole lot more blowing up.

When did you last hear someone from Williams say this. Or Lotus? Or even Marussia, FFS. Not impressed with Red Bull this year. My six year old son handles defeat better than they do. And he can sulk like a champion too! 




 Note: In the UK, the chances of him driving again any time soon would be pretty much zip. Unsurprisingly, we are somewhat reticent about letting people back on the road if they might fall unconscious at the wheel. IIRC, 1 month if they can find a cause, 6 months (or more) if they can't and therefore can't be sure it won't happen again.

Tough love, but it would be for his benefit, as well as those about him. He could very easily have killed someone there...next time, he might find that he's burnt up all of his luck credits already :-/

Anyone know what the situation would be in the USofA? 




 Apart from me. I'm fucking awesome, me.

(Sorry) 




 Brit reporting in - I always apologise to my car if I hit too big of a pothole. 




 Britain: Damn, we're good at queuing! 




 True, but look on the plus side: UKIP only won one seat!

Every cloud has a silver lining :-) 




 Also works for checking for "live" fibres when wiring SANs :-) 




 33 a race is "not a bad deal"!?

I'd switch sports in an instant rather than pay close to this! 




 Meh, I have a recorder so just watch in the evening when the kids are in bed and I can have some peace and quiet. And, as a bonus, if there's a weather or SC delay, the fast-forward button works... :-)

Only races I watch live are the far eastern ones and only then if they are on the BBC. 




 I find a computer to be indispensable:

 Chris Pratt had something to say on this subject:

 Update: Lowden finished but was lapped three times by the leaders. 

Alonso was also competing but his shorts exploded at the 15th mile marker. He was, however, upbeat and said that Honda were due to deliver uprated shorts in time for Barcelona.  




 Don't let the internet hit you as you leave... 




 Woohoo! I might be on the telly yet :-) 




 Nope. So much nope. 




 Sweet baby Jesus!

Didn't some kid die after filming something just like this? 




 And I thought I was bad for telling my kids to "man up" when they tell me they are tired during a bike ride!

I reckon I'm the world's best dad now :-) 




 Didn't Kvyat manage to cross the line? 




 Is it me, or are those wheels just downright _wrong_ for the car? They look to me to be the incorrect offset, forgetting the obvious fact that they are clearly too big!

In the UK, at least, they would be illegal as the protrude from the wheel arches and would thus be dangerous to other road users, but especially "soft targets" such as cyclists or pedestrians. 




 Out of all of the terrible things here, this one is the biggest NOPE by a country mile. Given me the shivers just thinking about it. Gnnn... 




 Does anyone have any feedback on how good, technically, this kit is?

Looking at the raincoat and softshells, which are upwards of 100, there's very little information on what they are made from. If I was buying in a shop, I'd probably expect gore-tex or Windstopper type materials at that price....

Obviously, I'd expect the very best here, especially as they are being subsidised by the sponsors' logos ;-) 




 In the UK, never had to have a sick note for anything less than a few days off (honestly, I can remember how long and it's been nearly 10 years since I had more than a couple off in a row).

If I put my manager hat on, I perhaps would get a little grumpy at "Morning After The Night Before" illnesses. Not because of the time off, but more because of the diligent staff that have to pick up the extra work and cover for those who aren't as conscientious.

I'm pleased to say that for the last 10 years I've worked with a great team who wouldn't dream of dropping people in the shit like this, and arguing about the odd sick day here and there would never have crossed my mind.

Treat people like kids and they'll just return the favour... 




 Note: if you can come to work with influenza, you don't have influenza. 




 Quite right too, sir!

All I saw on Sunday was a team *and* a driver who were /so/ excited to win. It was great to see regardless of which team you support.

There were no losers this Sunday.

(Well, ok. McLaren, a little bit ;-) ) 




 *shrug*

I supported Lewis last year, but I'd be lying if I denied that a bit of me wants to see Vettel win with Ferrari.

Just because people support the sport and not necessarily a specific team or driver does not make them less of a fan... 




 Fait comment, but I must refer you back to the governing rule #1 in my original post ;-) 




 Have you tried it on the current release? It tells you that it will stop working soon. And in the dev release it's already disabled.

The problem here is that the rest of the world are moving away from proprietary plugins but Sky aren't. 




 EJ is a special, exclusive feature with the BBC. With a beard ;-)

I'm not quite sure why you bothered to ask the question as your response is basically saying that you've made up your mind anyway.
