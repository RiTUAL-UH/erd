 [Maho's Japanese VA has pretty good english too](https://youtu.be/dhl_j6gcww8?t=5m32s). Ryusuke's VA has a thick accent but understandable enough.

It also kind of bothered me that Koyuki never bothered learning english until the end of the manga.
 














 I got confused and thought the colonists already got annihilated but right now that's what they're trying to prevent. I believe those colonists were the group of pacifist that wanted to leave Sidonia. Wouldn't be surprised if the Captain is using them as a lure.

 It's unfortunate the Karen Kimishima story got cut out. That small arc was pretty hilarious. 














 Whoever did the GUI design for Sidonia should get a raise. Interplay between HQ and the battlefield was excellent as always, I think this is what sets KoS apart from other anime with large scale battles.

 Just Genocidal Organ but I'm definitely planning to read Harmony. Unfortunately there's no translation for The Empire of Corpses yet. Hopefully that would come out before the blu-ray release. 




 Genocidal Organ was incredibly depressing. Hopefully the film can capture the oppressive and dreary feeling the novel had. 

It was also densely packed with ideas relating to technology, philosophy, psychology, sociology, and politics. Even though it can feel academic at times, it was for the most part thought provoking.

 The playerbase around 3 million or so. I really doubt most of the players who watched the anime liked it. Personally, I know of several people who disliked it along with others that I've talked to on the internet.

Conjecture and anecdotal evidence are far worse than small sample size data. My point of contention is people better have data to back it up if they're going to claim something is hated by the majority. 




 Looking at the [Niconico survey results](http://zakitakubu.com/2015/04/04/kancolle-achieves-39-1-not-good-rating-on-niconico-live-survey/) it seems like the majority of fans like the anime except for the final episode.

 [They really don't look that similar](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDiu_6_W8AAt0wM.jpg). 




 I think so far the anime is doing a good job of condensing the story but if you're enjoying this then I think you will love the full experience of the manga. Go read it! 




 The scuffles were more entertaining than the Klitschko and Demetrious Johnson fights. 




 I went back to the space scene. The camera was moving at 24 fps but there were times the characters would start jittering which made it look like a framerate problem. Also in these first few episodes I've noticed some panning and tilting shots where the camera moved at 12 fps, which I don't think happened in the first season. I think Polygon might have been stretched thin since Ronja was two cours and demanded more manpower for higher quality art and animation.

 I got a feeling the director saw Gravity and decided to copy the single shot free-moving camera work for the dialogue scene in space. Thought it looked good and might be the first time I've seen a long take with dynamic camera movement in anime. 




 Jesus, that throw to first by Betances was scary. 




 I'm really curious how the adaptation will handle the heavy psychological, philosophical and political exposition and discourse that were present in Genocidal Organ.

Still haven't read Harmony. 









 Sometimes Jarrett Jack hero ball works but a lot of the time it makes me want to throw the remote at the tv. 




 A frugal and squatter MC and a panhandling cat as a sidekick. Perfect combo.

  Quite honestly - when Lebron was 21, he wasn't as good at basketball as Davis is now.

As a 21 year old Lebron average 31.4/6.6/7. Lead the league with a VORP of 9.5 compared to Davis's 5.7 this year. 




 Alright, time to start watching Sazae-san. 




 More than halfway through **Bamboo Blade**. Simple characters and story but it's very charming and funny. It's a bit like Hanayamata but with Kendo, and with less drama and more laughs.

Also, I think the English dub is great. 




 YES 




 Oh wow I forgot that Ian Eagle and the Czar are also doing this game. I like this duo better. 




 Give the ball to Brook you fucking idiots. 









 You take this MC, throw it in a pot, add some genius ability, characters to make fool of, and a damsel in distress. Baby, youve got a Stu going.  




 I guess this is what it would look like if Tatsuya Shiba became a chef. 









 Kyubei's SFX penis crying along with her was the funniest part.

I was expecting a gag with Kondo being NTR'd by Ham-san.

 









 Every season I sometimes pickup an anime with a wacky concept (e.g. Kancolle, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei) just for the novelty of it and with very little expectations. This was my pick for this season and it was definitely better than expected. But now I have some expectations for it and the prospect of adapting a bunch of chapters into 12 episodes doesn't sound too encouraging. I think as long as the show remains funny I'll be satisfied, then give the manga a read sometime later. 









 When they showed that tiny cyborg ninja standing on the puddle of that girl's blood I had to rewind to make sure that really happened. I need to know more about that finger slicer.

Kind of disappointed that the phonetic lip syncing and expressive facial animation that Polygon did in Sanzoku no Musume Ronja didn't carry over to season 2 of Sidonia. This pretty much suggests the budget difference between the two. Action scenes still looked great with great sense of speed. 




 The "sloth on head" got a good chuckle out of me. The light hearted humor continues to be funny. The usage of narrator had some good comedic timing.

Also, gotta give NHK some love for always backing two cour shows.

 [This episode might be more about feet than music.](http://imgur.com/a/JuSAZ) Joking aside some of the shots of feet animation were clever use of body language to express emotion. 




 The problem is the 60 fps is just frame interpolation not actual animation. CG actually hand animated at 60 fps would look great but the man-power and budget required would be ridiculous even for Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks. CG at 60 fps with the use of Mo-cap is probably doable though. 




 These are animated at 12 fps. They look pretty fluid.

 Nadai is a hell of a drug.

Yona in that dancing outfit. I wonder what's the connection between Hak and Lili. My best guess is they were arranged to be married when they were kids.

It seems like these arcs are building up to a bigger conflict with the Kai Empire. 




 Nataru Fights (Birdy the Mighty: Decode 02). So emotionally driven to the point they were cathartic.

 









 This is something Tony Stark would do. 




 That fight sequence was kind of sloppy. The character and camera movements kept switching between right-to-left and left-to-right with very little continuity connecting those switches. The lack of sense of direction made it feel so disjointed. 




 He seemed very aware of the potential of a sucker punch. Someone can be trained but if they lack that awareness they could still get caught with a punch. 




 This show struggled to make sense of each conflict for every arc and the girls role in mitigating it. Character motives, why people are fighting, what they're fighting about and other story elements just get jumbled together. The show's redeeming qualities are the girls were really endearing and at times the animation and art were vividly colorful and energetic. 




 But Erika is more into BL.
 




 Logic was already ignored when people think a show without a high budget can look like a high budget quality show by simply switching studios.

Other than the character design changes I didn't think the animation and art this season was any worse than the last.  




 I know you guys love Madhouse but it's kind of odd there's not a single praise for Yuzuru Tachikawa, the creator, writer, and director of the show. 









 [Death Parade Episode 12 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/03/death-parade-episode-12.html)  




 Hmm...plans for the 2nd season was announced on November 2014, that's news to me. First season sold really bad (374 discs first week sales). The backers must have known this would be the case from the start, so the anime series was mainly for the promotion of the Garo franchise.

I'm in for the 2nd season. The 1st season had an uneven quality but nothing egregiously dislikeable. It also had some great moments and overall the show was entertaining. 




 [Source](https://youtu.be/GZ39V34qInQ) 









 [](/s "Can I lie?"). Such a great moment and memorable line. 




 That would've been a great quietly dramatic scene if it was a minute shorter and had an actual payoff. 




 [From this short movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWMnzbj61mc feature=youtu.be)

[Brief write-up on it](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/03/645-am-sun-31-august-2014.html) 














 The "Dark Dragon" name gets a funnier use later on.

Also the chapters after this finale are seriously funny. 









 That fight was a riot. It had a fireman's carry throw, rear naked choke, "look over there" trick, ear pulling and a Rocky-ish music. The other robbers' reaction were amusing too. 




 Technically it's not even a revival as this episode made clear she can't bring the dead back to life. 




  I must admit I pity her for choosing him.

I think she's just using him. 




 Thank god, Galfa's character didn't get the redemption route. I was worried that might happen after Joseph's "I admired you" speech. That character was irredeemable. I think he was basically an allegorical character that represented the negative qualities of humans, such as jealousy, greed, dishonesty and etc. 









 You should've formed your own club where you look for time travelers, espers and aliens. 




 Have you watched Shirobako? How accurate is its depiction of the anime industry? 




 At this point I'm all for Asseylumnator plot twist. 




 Then come back alive for another season. 









 I really didn't see anything wrong with the CGI in this PV. I swear, the CG could have top notch quality cel shading with Pixar level animation and people would still complain. 














 [Death Parade Episode 11 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/03/death-parade-episode-11.html) 









 I wonder if this might get a live action J-drama adaptation. I'd definitely give it a watch if that happens. 




 This was my second read through so it didn't affect me as much but I remember being close to tearing up at the "I love you" part. The nice slow build up to that part was what made it so emotive.

The rooftop scene was practically Kaori's love confession so this letter was more of a reinforcement of her feelings and less of a confession beyond the grave. Although some may feel it's still the latter and be peeved by it.

I thought it was a great manga. Kousei's character development had an ebb and flow to it instead of a linear progression. It made his development feel natural since people don't improve and change at a constant pace. The story was also very effective at demonstrating the notion of bonding, healing and expressing oneself through music. I think this was less of a love story and more of a human drama between two people supporting each other through music as they navigate lifes tribulations. 




 A lot of NYC subway platforms don't have enough space for proper line forming, especially the island platform ones.

For example: [The Wall Street Subway Platform](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Wall_Street_Subway.jpg) 




 I missed how fun these Karasuno guys can be. Is there enough material yet for a second season? 




 The episode gets you all hyped up for the duel and then cliff hanger. Next episode should be fun. 




 They would also adjust by hand if they don't like the preset mouth shapes for certain scenes.

 I think if you look at their relationship from a purely romantic standpoint then youre not going to get much out of it. If you look at their relationship as human drama between two people supporting each other through music as they navigate lifes tribulations, then I think its a relationship thats layered and gratifying. 




 Whenever I see the ED with Lara in it my heart sinks a bit. 









 [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Episode 21 - Cinematography ](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/03/shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso-your-lie-in.html) 




 It's probably already flooded with tears.

I thought I was ready for that rooftop scene after finishing the manga. Nope, it still got a few tears out of me. 




 I would have preferred if we heard Mattis's side of the story that lead to the reunion. It was still touching though.  




 I hope Marion comes back healthy. I'm curious to see what a perimeter defense of LeBron, Shumpert and Marion would look like. 




  edit: I think CG in anime actually suffer more from the simple motions rather than the complex. They can be wonderfully fluid when complex, but look robotic when it's just a simple tilt of the head.

http://gfycat.com/GeneralPlumpIggypops

I think that's pretty damn good.

 




 Episodes 47-50 of Cross Game were the most gratifying moments in anime I've ever experienced. Episode 47 is really damn memorable especially the line Kou delivered. 




 You're right about the inconsistent quality of character animation but there are plenty of traditional anime that are worse but we give it a pass because we have gotten used to it.

Actually one of the best character and facial animation I've seen in anime is from Sanzoku no Musume Ronja, another CG show done by Polygon.

 This reminded me how well shot this anime was. Yeah, the video cherry picked the best shots but the entirety of the first season had good quality cinematography.

Shizuno did a great job directing the first season. I'm a bit nervous about the second season being directed by a first time director (Hiroyuki Seshita). 




 After this season ends, it's manga marathon time for me.

I had enough self control to stop reading around the time they met Ki-ja but after seeing what's about to develop I just can't wait for the 2nd season that might not come. 




 Thank god we have two more episodes. It would've been painful if the season ended that way. This episode packed so much hype; Jaeha flying to the rescue, we get to see more of Shinah skills, Yona's killer instinct and "the reunion."

Really liked how Yona's development through a climactic external conflict was followed by her having to face her internal conflict, which is her feelings for Soo-Won. Pretty damn excited about the reactions from Yona, Soo-Won and Hak in the final two episodes.

Also, Hak is barely making any progress with Yona as it is and now Soo-Won shows up.  




 Read this chapter and then chapter 44...ahh that feeling of enveloping sadness. I was welling but the dam didn't quite break. I think anime will do that if executed really well.

I really appreciate that it didn't go big for the tear jerker, like having Kousei by Kaori's deathbed or something equally superfluously morose. The manga stayed true to her story which is not about that she's terminally ill but the way she lived and her connection with Kousei. 




 The hand washing scene was excellently storyboarded. The graphic match cuts of Kousei and Kaori's hands working in rhythm with the alternating silence and sound of running water was serenely melancholic.

Also really liked the reserved use of canted framing. It was saved for the right moments. A lot of anime tend to overuse canted shots when things get tense or dramatic and the effect gets lost. The hand washing scene saved it for the last shot and it worked well as a visual supplement to Kousei's emotions.  




 Not sure if I'm describing this right but the dialogue between Ronja and Lovis, and her summer speech felt prose-like.

21 episodes in and I'm still loving the mouth animation. Really gonna miss that once this is over.

Also don't watch the preview.  














 I thought the Yuuge episode was pretty light hearted except for the [](/s "unhappy marriage part"). I also liked all of them since they touched on different aspects of life but the last one was really depressing. 




 The show cracked Japan's top ten animation TV ratings a few times, so it's doing well. S2 is highly likely.
