 That isn't his job now, http://www.monsanto.com/whoweare/pages/fred-perlak.aspx

you just aren't familiar with what industrial scientists do! 




 I'd like to get some of these industrial people to talk about something the grad students are really concerned with:  getting a job. 




 No, but I've been working on getting big companies to join our discussions, and this sort of thing is completely outside of the traditional culture. Cultural change is hard, especially when you're talking to people in there late 50's/early 60's! 




 We didn't, in my opinion that isn't controversial, or particularly relevant.  It's a difference of opinion.  If you're looking for an excuse to be upset, then there probably isn't any talking you out of it though. 




 Based on the actual AMA, what are your thoughts? 




 Things worked out pretty well, but I am tired now! 




 Let me see what I can do, I'm at work and my image capture options are limited... 




 This is exactly true, I emailed Janice Person in August of 2014 completely out of the blue with my "Come Talk to reddit" sales pitch.  I still have the email chain in our gmail account! 




 Point them to our AMA Submission Guide!  We have a partnership with the ACS, so you can look forward to some quality AMAs from big name chemists (like Harry Gray!) 




 It was just posted.

 




 If only this was true, remember corporation are run by people in there late 50's/60's, they have never heard of reddit and took a lot of explaining.    




 I agree, I want reddit to be a cross-cultural meeting place to discuss important issue in a civil manner.  Some people are more interested in putting on a display of anger, but that doesn't get anyone anywhere. 




 In contrast to what the conspiracy people believe, corporations aren't really interested in reddit.  They are run by a generation that has largely never heard of reddit, convincing them that putting any effort into it was a challenge.  After that, corporation talk about things *forever* (I speak from experience here.)  

Recall when people talk about small business being faster and more agile that big corporations?  This is what they are talking about. 




 it is only kid gloves to people who can't contain their emotions, people who are used to having civil conversations do so without even thinking about.  There is never any need to be discourteous, just because that is routinely ignored on reddit doesn't make it ok. 




 That is how it is, very few top scientists work in lab these days, the same is true in academia, Nobel prize winners don't do bench work, they write grants and give talks. 




 We do let the votes work, on the questions that meet our publicly stated ground rules.  We have been doing this since January of 2014, these aren't new rules. 




 My apologizes if I misinterpreted your comments, you may have noticed other comments around here, they aren't so nice.

The fact is, I have spent months vetting this AMA, and we know who Fred is, I have contacts within the company and outside who give me information off the record, all of them say Fred is the guy to do this.

All of the political stuff just tells me he can think on his feet, everyone knows he represents Monsanto, that's a given, but he is a scientist, not a MBA or a marketing person.  He may not be in lab now but he did his time which makes him one of us. 




 whilr I can't require an answer to every question, does anyone doubt there will be far too many questions to answer?, I push all of our AMA guests to answer the top voted questions first. That seems to be the only fair way to go. 




 We have rules, you chose to ignore them, next time you start by messaging the mods and establishing yourself.  Also, taking pot shots at us is crap. 




 No, only ask questions that are civil and polite.  One can disagree without being disagreeable.  Anyone who can't frame their question without anger doesn't sufficiently understand the question! 




 Asking a question in anger, or using humour, does not reduce the validity of the question

It does get the question removed here, and now that you know the ground rules if you violate them you can't complain about your question being removed, since you made the choice to have it removed yourself.  Action = Consequence. 




 We get those too, organizations doing official AMAs like this is much harder.  Lawyers and human resources are involved.  ugh. 




 None of that means anything, of course he's a registered lobbyist, you have to do that to talk to politicians, there are legal requirements.  As for contributions, so what?  I've cut multiple checks to politicians, if I could afford to do it more I would, last time I checked that's how the American political system works: you support those who represent your point of view.

"If any mods want my credentials on this feel free to e-mail me. "

And you supplied your email address?  Nope.  So we can't email you, can we?  Also, everyone else making claims **follows the subreddit rules** which require you to get the flair before you make the claim.   




 They do, and several have flair in /r/science.

 




 This is none of those areas since it could not possibly be decades old.

Also, it's our house, and our rules, those who wish to yell can start their own AMA series in their own subreddit. 




 I respectfully disagree with you on this.  While he is certianly operations leader, his title that of a scientist.  Every corporation has a bevy of Vice-presidents, it's just a level.  All high-level scientists at science-based companies take on a public outreach function, that's how it is.  Of course this is about public relations, any public interaction necessarily is, that's the definition of talking to the public.

Referring to veiled "credentials" also doesn't get you far here, users with credentials have flair stating such, which you have none.
 




 I have had a year and a half to prepare for this, /r/science can handle it. 




 I think we can be pretty sure that Monsanto's goal isn't to drive Indian farmers to commit suicide.  The whole concept doesn't pass the sniff test, it's just far to hyperbolic.

From one of the links:

For example, a 2012 paper in The Lancet that surveyed Indias suicide mortality rate noted: Studies from south India have shown that the most common contributors to suicide are a combination of social problems, such as interpersonal and family problems and financial difficulties, and pre-existing mental illness.

So yeah, blaming GMO seeds for every suicide by a farmer since the mid-1990's is beyond misleading, it's unethical. 




 Actually, reddit only gets AMAs from people trying to promote specific things, getting scientists has not been as easy.  Convincing corporations to take this risk has been very challenging, I've been working on this one for **18** months. 




 Exactly.  Who would ever come talk to a group that just wants to yell at them? This is the basis of our civility requirement, in addition to it being the right thing to do. 




 It's not to make them happy, it's to follow our rules. If users don't like our rules, they don't have to post questions.  
 




 Could explain what that is? 




 I can deal with, by removing the comment, and if needed banning the user. 

This our house, we make the rules, and the rules are "be polite." 




 The question if phrased correctly is fine, but that's the point, it needs to be phrased in a civil manner, minus the accusations. 




 That's actually an example of a question that would be removed as uncivil because it is an accusation not a question, if you don't know how to ask the question with basic decorum, them you aren't qualified to be asking the question. 




 For those of you who aren't aware, tomorrow's Science AMA is with Dr. Fred Perlak of Monsanto, a legit research scientist here to talk about the science and practices of Monsanto.

First, thanks for your contributions to make /r/science one of the largest, if not the largest, science forums on the internet, we are constantly amazed at the quality of comments and submissions.

We know this is an issue that stirs up a lot of emotion in people which is why we wanted to bring it to you, it's important, and we want important issues to be discussed openly and in a civil manner.

Some background:  

**I approached Monsanto about doing an AMA**, Monsanto is not involved in manipulation of reddit comments to my knowledge, and I had substantial discussions about the conditions we would require and what we could offer.

We require that our AMA guests be scientists working in the area, and not PR, business or marketing people. We want a discussion with people who do the science.

We offer the guarantee of civil conversation.  Internet comments are notoriously bad; anonymous users often feel empowered to be vicious and hyperbolic.  We do not want to avoid hard questions, but one can disagree without being disagreeable.  Those who cannot ask their questions in a civil manner (like that which would be appropriate in a college course) will find their comments removed, and if warranted, their accounts banned.  /r/science is a serious subreddit, and this is a culturally important discussion to have, if you can't do this, it's best that you not post a comment or question at all.

Normally we restrict questions to just the science, since our scientists don't make business or legal decisions, it's simply not fair to hold them accountable to the acts of others.

However, to his credit, Dr. Perlak has agreed to answer questions about both the science and business practices of Monsanto because of his desire to directly address these issues.  Regardless of how we personally feel about Monsanto, we should applaud his willingness to come forward and engage with the reddit user base.

The AMA will be posted tomorrow morning, with answers beginning at 1 pm ET to allow the user base a chance to post their questions and vote of the questions of other users.  

We look forward to a fascinating AMA, please share the link with other in your social circles, but when you do please mention our rules regarding civil behavior.

Thanks again, and see you tomorrow.

Nate

 I just spent the cash to rebuild the transmission in my E61, it was expensive ($3700) but I looked around and there wasn't another wagon that was comparable for close to the cost.  The Audi Avants are still around, but rare, especially used.

 If both users have relevant flair, then presumably the answer isn't clear, which happens in science all of the time, that's why we run experiments! 




 I am a mod for science and AskScience, and we are aware of this issue.

This is one of the reasons we have flaired users, you can judge how relevant their expertise is, or if they have any at all.  The general user doesn't have the background to judge the quality of the references or the argument, so they aren't using that.  Flair gives them something else factual to go by.

Further, if on of our flaired users tells us as comment is inaccurate, we delete the entire comment thread.  It doesn't matter how many votes the comment has.  We can't be experts in everything, but at this point we have experts available covering almost everything.

 I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who organizes AMAs on /r/science :-)

This also puts me is a strange position of being the only one who speaks to the scientific community about reddit and social media. 




 I understand they release quite a few as well, but I don't know, I'm just asking. 




 The Cayman Islands have two industries:  international banking and turtle farming.  The banking part clearly doesn't factor in here, but how important are the efforts of the turtle breeding program there?  Is this a drop in the bucket or a huge aspect?

If any one is interested in the turtle farm, [here is their website](http://www.turtle.ky/)

 When I was a much younger chemist, I briefly considered research in to antimalarial drugs on a non-profit basis.  It didn't work out for other reasons, but I still wonder on occasion if the model of writing grants for supporting a non-profit organization geared towards new treatments of diseases that primarily affect the world's poor is viable. 

I know that the pharma companies haven't ignored new antibiotics, it's just a really hard area (I think it was Eli Lilly that dropped several hundred million dollars into an effort and came up empty handed.)

 Would the funding structure be aimed at existing for-profit and academic institutions or is there a way that overhead costs could be covered by this funding?

 I have a couple in Wissahickon and in Belmont (from a Thursday Night Ride) on my MTB, and a few top-3 on SRT, I swear the top rides people taking advantage of GPS bugs! 

Sadly I no longer live in the area, so my times will eventually be passed.

 Most of the time you can do that, some times the walls were put up after the tub was put in, and that's not an option!

Also, tubs are heavy, bits of a tub lesser so. 




 I thought the way you removed an old iron tub was to smack it with a sledge hammer to shatter it.
