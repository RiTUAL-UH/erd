 Ok, a little late but has anyone played Golgo 13? I saw the movie when I was younger and I see the game every so often for cheap but don't know if it's a hidden gem for the NES. 




 Thanks so far on all these titles! I'm heading on over to ebay and Amazon to check some out since i have no local game store where I live :( 




 I saw this game on Gaming Historian a couple weeks ago. Might have to pick it up...
