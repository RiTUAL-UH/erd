 Guess who just voted for the Yard Goats as my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place choices! Goat images/facts please 




 Skipped my first 2 classes because of this exact thing. 
Thanks for bringing a smile to my face.

 That's what I'm thinking

 I went from jmu today and it was fine so if you go tomorrow morning you should be okay. I went the Cass way. Hope this helps 




 Somebody please help all of us. Please. 




 Yeah let me know if you plan on going up though! I'm always down to shred snowshoe if I have the money 




 I go to jmu (obligatory "fuck vt") but I would definitely try to make it up for a weekend. I don't know if I'd be able to do this year (moneys) but in the future for sure!
