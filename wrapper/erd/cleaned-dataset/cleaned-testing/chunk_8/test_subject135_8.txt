 Those are too useful to be knickknicks or gewgaws, which are more like what you'd buy someone for a souvenir, like a paperweight or a snowglobe.  




 It's by Voltaire.

 I saw that you wrote that and I don't agree. Considering that we're working off of extremely limited information, nobody is in a position to play armchair doctor when there are far simpler and more likely explanations, especially since you seem to be unaware of the fact that some men stink too and they don't have vaginas.  




 It's much more likely that you're smelling something they ate that tends to hang around and gets exuded (like onions, garlic, fish and curry) than you are smelling their vagina. Or they simply don't bathe often enough, so you're smelling stale sweat. 

And this is not limited to women. Men smell bad too all the time for the same reasons. 




  You're supposed to assume it's a movie adaptation of that same book :P I think I will have to edit that and make it more clear.

I figured that's what you meant, but the answer is the same: depends on the book; depends on the movie. Maybe some book or movie fanatics will say that one is always better than the other but I think that's silly. Sometimes the book might be better, sometimes the movie might be better, and perhaps shockingly, they might even both be equally good. So how can I have a preference without knowing specifically what book or movie we're referring to? 




 Little weiner dogs, pitbulls, bulldogs (especially English bulldogs, holy cow they're not even handsome)... I don't know, you name it, there are lots of breeds that aren't that cute. 




 What I was asking was what were the good qualities of the breeds that aren't generally considered cute, but clearly I phrased my question badly.  




 Today I saw a man walking the cutest, sweetest, happiest little dog and it made me wonder why anybody would want to get a dog that wasn't cute.  




 Refuse to believe that it's real, not a publicity stunt for the latest Alien sequel.

  Hamotzei meichaveiro, alav harayah.

Great phrase. Never heard it before, which surprises me since it's a very useful phrase for the kind of people that I hang around with.  




 What age did you learn to read? 

No idea. So I guessed.

Do you prefer reading the book or watching the movie?

Depends what book. Depends what movie. 

What are the reasons you do not read books

Um, I do read books. Where's the option for N/A?

If you had more free time, would you read more? 

Is that predicated on the previous question's assumption that you don't read books?  




 Apparently it is based on their art, and there are those that dispute that the color was true to life. Now I feel bad about posting this.

 Bowel movement is attested by 1874.

Sounds like a euphemistic term that the Victorians made up so they would have to say "defecate" or whatever term they used before that. 




  There's always going to be a opposing school of Jewish thought, saying "there is no debate" is such a concrete statement that it's false on its face.

Not in this case there isn't. Judaism does not joke around with saving a person's life. Life is the number one commandment. (Except for a very few specific exceptions.)

If you have proof that there's some debate on this matter, then show it.  




 Hasidic families with 15 children and parents who don't want to work because they think it's beneath them

That is not why they don't work. They don't work because they refuse to go to the army and if you don't go to the army you're not *allowed* to work. 

(This is a very simplified reason but the point is that it is nothing to do with thinking that work is "beneath" them.) 




 This is incorrect. If the mother's life is at risk, the fetus is considered a "rodef" (a "pursuer") and abortion is 100% allowed. There is no debate on this matter. 




 Yes, absolutely. Though that has nothing to do with elective abortions. 









 I would say, "You're a philistine and I'm embarrassed for you." 




 If you only read 2-3 books a month, I can't understand why you'd want to major in literature. That's not what I'd call the mark of somebody who's a huge reader. I read 2-3 books a *week* and I didn't want to major in literature. I hope you're planning on changing your major. No sense in suffering through that for four years. 




 You just watch the movie instead, I suppose. I liked it, at any rate. It's funny but pretty dark and contemplative.  




 It's not about the "inconvenience," it's about the principle that United is engaging in deceptive advertising and they need to stop. Just complaining and demanding a refund is unlikely to stop them. A lawsuit (regardless of whether the plaintiffs win or lose) is embarrassingly bad publicity and brings the information to people's attention when they might not have known about it otherwise and might have been taken in. 

Also, what you missed is that it's not one person suing, it's a class action lawsuit. That means that any money won gets divided up among as many people as sign on. If 10,000 people are named as plaintiffs and they win $5 million it means that each person would get significantly less than $500 after taking off lawyers' fees. 




 It's called poetic license. Doesn't mean it was well-done in this case, but it's certainly a thing. 




 My parents never bought antibacterial soap ever and I get a cold at least a couple of times a year and got the flu at least twice. Whether you get sick or not depends on a lot more than whether you used antibacterial soap or not. There's genetics, the health of your immune system, how stressed you are, how often you are exposed to germs, how good you are about not touching your eyes or mouth if you haven't washed your hands recently, etc...... 




 Exactly. A good play will read well and a bad play will sometimes be improved by watching it being performed (but not always). I recently saw and read The Weir by Conor McPherson and it was tedious to read and watch. 

As for OP's point, Shakespeare is obviously more difficult for most people than modern plays so naturally it won't be as enjoyable to read. 

But OP might like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead by Tom Stoppard. 




 You can't make such a broad statement based on reviews of one book. You want to talk Japanese literature, Haruki Murakami is America's darling. 

You'll also have to be more specific about what the reviews were complaining about. Could be that it was poorly translated. People said the same thing about Battle Royale so when they reissued it recently, they re-translated it first -- and it still had language problems. They must have cheaped out on paying a translator and editor. 




 Why do Danny DeVito and Steve Buscemi get massive amounts of upvotes and Cumberbatch none?  




 My friend loves The Search for WondLa but I found it too derivative. 

Skulduggery Pleasant: Scepter of the Ancients by Derek Landy is *slightly* derivative but comes together really well. Recommended. 




 Read the first paragraph in Wikipedia and it clearly says that the band was a disaster internally and eventually fell apart. That's why they fell in popularity. Nothing to do with the quality of their music or the public's taste in music.

 And this is why Americans are fat. Instead of living to eat, try eating to live. Redditors love their Soylent, but you can have the food equivalent. Chicken breast made on a grill, steamed vegetables, potato. Nice, healthy meal, cheap, easy. Simple foods don't need recipes or extensive ingredients. As long as you have a spice rack, you're good to go.

 Scariest books I ever read: Pet Cemetery and Salem's Lot, both by Stephen King. 




 That definitely helps, but I've gotten gold twice on comments that had content but I didn't think were so much more awesome than anything else I've ever written. So my conclusion is that getting gold is often a matter of sheer luck, that something you say happens to strike a chord with someone else.

 They accept converts. They may not always treat them right, socially speaking, but you can still join if you really insist. The only group that does not accept converts are Syrians. 




 Confirmation bias. I don't generally watch people swipe their credit cards but I do see them swipe their Metrocards to get on the train and I can tell you that there is no age difference between those who swipes lightly and those who act like their Metrocard is an ax and the turnstile is a tree they're trying to cut down.

Ditto.

AirBNB allows hosts to rate their guests... I guess this needs to be used more often, or there should be a way of other people in the building being able to rate the guests.  




 Check out Ogden Nash, then, or any poetry that's considered "light verse."

 Heh. That explains it.  




 And people think kicking a button four feet off the ground is convenient in any way? What are they, can-can dancers?

My brain is just not willing to accept that people do this.  




 I'm really confused. How low is this button or how tall are the people  who've done this that it's convenient to push the button with their feet?  




 When I searched, this is the only thing I could find:

Conservative rabbis have extended the concept of adultery to include a husband cheating on his wife with an unmarried woman (which does not fall under the traditional definition), and are willing to command a husband to offer a divorce to his wife if she wants one, and to dissolve the marriage unilaterally if he refuses (which would not be permitted under traditional Jewish law  only a man can initiate a divorce).

 Not much of a poetry reader. I only read these three collections in the past few years:

- Only in the Meantime   Office Poems by Mario Benedetti

- What Matters Most is How Well You Walk Through the Fire by Charles Bukowski

- Introduction to German Poetry edited by Gustave Mathieu and Guy Stern (I highly recommend this) 




 Not all poetry is like this. Some of it is perfectly straightforward. 




 Data entry. Medical transcription.  




 I've heard it was depressing so I've been avoiding it. You didn't think it was depressing?

Passover is a Jewish holiday. A seder is a Jewish ritual. 




 A significant amount of it comes from the outside. Homes that have better seals at the bottom of walls and around doors and windows will have less dust. 




 You are aware that the Magna Carta is 800 years old, right? When the US Constitution is 800 years old, come back and see if you're still asking this question. 




 Of course it gets hot. That's why air conditioners were invented. I'm being slightly sarcastic but the point is that they are just like anybody else and when it gets hot, they spend their time indoors where it's cool. They are not like the Amish who shun modern technology.

It is effective for getting toned. But not for getting ripped. 




  Ironically a lot of Japanese people think Westerners are the weird ones for obsessing about the weird but rare elements of their culture, and they have a point.

  P.S. Good canon vs. cannon word play.

Thanks! 




 I think you've taken the quote out of context and it doesn't say what you think it's saying. In fact, he's saying the opposite. He's saying that if people properly appreciated how good (and sometimes bad) the classics are, they wouldn't be so opposed to novelty and individualism in art. Instead, they've elevated the classics to a sacrosanct canon and artists' new works are "canon"-fodder. 

ETA: Gold! Wow, thank you, whoever you are! 




 Considering that the Flowers for Algernon thread has over 2,000 upvotes and the comments all seem to be positive, I can't see how you think that people here think that liking Flowers for Algernon is so bad. The Green Eggs and Ham thread is just a silly joke that I personally would delete because it adds nothing to this sub, but I don't see it as being mean-spirited. 









 I read a book once by a survivor who talked about how the Jews in Auschwitz hated Christians because the Nazi's were "Christians" and attended church every Sunday.

Either you are misremembering what the book said or the book has no idea what it's talking about. Take your pick.

The Nazi persecuted the Jews based on race, not religion. The church played little to no part in the active persecution of Jews.

The Catholic Church mostly stood by in silence during the Holocaust while the Protestant denominations were somewhat opposed to the Nazis -- out of self-interest. They were against Nazi control of churches; they didn't care about the Jews.

Here's an article about it: http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005206 




 Don't see how any of these things make koalas worse than, say, rats.

 This is why I love temporary tattoos. 




 It sounds like therapy might be helpful.  




 I think I see what you're saying, and that's what they're doing in Kiryas Joel but people from there leave too. I don't think it's possible to isolate people so much from the world that they literally have no contact with it. 




 TV shows, songs, whatever other formats you can think of. 




 What does that have to do with anything? Chassidut wasn't founded because life was depressing and they needed a happy spirituality. It was founded because Judaism was in the hands of the elite and this was a way of bringing it to the poor and uneducated. It was innovative and almost rebellious. I'm not sure how it got to the state that it's in today, but conceptually Chassidut has a lot to offer, which is why you find a lot of people who become religious are drawn to the less strict and more spiritual groups like Lubavitch, Breslov and Boston. 




 Would you say the same thing about the Amish? 




 In the Bible, Og, the king of Bashan, was said to be a giant.

 I don't hate either of them. 

I read On the Road in college and it just made me roll my eyes and think *hipster*. 

I could never get into Bukowski's novels but I recently read a book of his poetry and some of it wasn't too bad, particularly when he was talking about himself as a kid. But the poems he wrote about being older were more repetitive and misogynistic and ultimately tedious. 




 I'd say either the Fountainhead or a Thousand Splendid Suns. But if you're going to have to take a test on it or write a report, Suns is probably easier to understand. The Fountainhead is ambiguous and weird at times. 




 Never heard of any of those people.

She doesn't really seem happy with being a Hollywood actress, taking a break might be a good idea. 




 Maybe I haven't seen her in enough movies, but what I've seen of her, aside from Twilight, she was terrible. (And I'm not a fan of Twilight, I just happen to think she fit the part very well.)

Who would you consider worse than her?  




 Her parents aren't in the entertainment business? 




  It probably helped Kristen Stewart get her start and she's making good money. He father's a producer and her mother is a script supervisor.

I didn't know that. That explains everything. 




 It's a bit unfair to judge until the person is older but it seems like someone like Gwyneth Paltrow (daughter of Blythe Danner and Bruce Paltrow) tanked while Jake Gyllenhaal (son of Stephen Gyllenhaal and Naomi Foner) seems to be going strong.

So who are some other actors/directors/producers who are the children of other actors/directors/producers whose careers are going well... or not? In other words, does nepotism work out? 




 I just watched the movie and I don't have the stomach to go through the experience again with the book, so I was wondering if anybody could tell me if the book went into detail about how and why Harry, Marion and Tyrone got into drugs? 

Another question: How old were they supposed to be? 

And, for anybody who's read and seen both, does the 1978 setting make more sense than 2000? Because the movie definitely wasn't set in 1978 but it didn't quite seem like it was set in 2000 either. More like ~1991.  




 I'd say beer is less unhealthy because it has less sugar. 




  birth rates dropping.

If we're talking about the US, the current generation is larger than any generation since the Baby Boomers, plus there is a lot of immigration. So unlike Europe that's in demographic trouble, the US is fine. 




 They can also eat food, which contains water.  




 What I have found is that condos tend to be more expensive but have lower maintenance costs while co-ops cost less but have higher maintenance. That makes a difference depending on how much you can afford to put down as a down payment and how much you can afford to pay monthly. 




 Maybe I'm mistaken, but it looks like it's available unabridged in three volumes. You just have to search for each volume separately, not as a set. 




 I think we're going to have to get our hands on it before we can comment. From the picture I can't see how it could possibly be a softcover, but most likely the picture is misleading. From a different angle the cover will probably look thinner and softer.  




 No doubt at the annual dinner it was mostly married couples, but from what I've always heard, dances were held for singles too.  




 Sure, but as I said above, it's not like it encapsulates the book. It's just the title of one story, which has nothing to do with the other stories. 




 It's a Russian airline. She could have said this on any of their planes and it would probably be true. There are some Russian (and other countries') airlines that are banned from flying in the US because their safety record is so bad.

 I feel like this happens a lot with books of short stories -- they'll choose the best or most outrageous story title and then it'll have nothing to do with the rest of the stories because they're not interrelated in any way.

 This describes the differences. I'd read both. Looks like you can get it on eBay for a relatively reasonable price, you just have to check to make sure it's the original version.

 But you aren't going to marry any of those people and if you do, you'll be miserable. Any happy long-term relationship requires all four types of connection, among other things.

Most marriages are indeed not happy ones. They are "happy-enough" ones. And the ones that are miserable usually end in divorce. Some guy did a huge marriage survey and did an AMA on it a little while back. He said that the only happy marriages were between two completely psychologically healthy people. And since most of us aren't completely psychologically healthy, neither are our relationships. 




 Even though a huge chunk of Russia's territory is in Asia, the vast majority of its population lives in the European part. Native Americans are called Indians because Columbus thought he was in the Indian Ocean when he was actually in the Americas. White comes from a German racial theory of the 18th century.

You may not like these derivations but they're not random and they made perfectly logical sense to whoever made them up. 




 We do get bored of drinking water. That's why these days they have all these additives to make the water taste a little different without adding too many calories or sugar. Otherwise it's just too tedious to drink too much of it unless we're really thirsty. 




 Not really. They're all a product of their time. But I would say that popular bestsellers from back then are a lot easier to read than what's considered a classic. The books may not be that great but they can be enjoyable and of historical interest. 

For example, Wired Love: A Romance of Dots and Dashes by Ella Cheever Thayer is a silly romantic comedy about a couple that falls in love via the telegraph. Change telegraph to Internet and it very nearly could have been written yesterday.  




 I found Sherlock Holmes to be difficult and boring and not timeless at all. 




 That wasn't what OP was asking about.

Yes, for old or sick people, e-reading can be helpful, but most people are not old or sick. 

Among young/healthy people you're just as likely to find people who say that reading on a tablet or phone is difficult for them because they keep getting distracted as much as you'll find people who say that they've suddenly started reading more because of them.

And if you want to say that easily distracted people should get dedicated e-readers, we get right back to my original point, that now having a tablet and phone and e-reader generates a lot more waste than books.  




 Thanks! 




 The classics are broccoli. The modern authors you mentioned are fast food burgers. Of course they cannot be expected to be written in the same way. Fast food tastes much better than broccoli. But it's still fast food, which means it's cheap crap. 




 Based on looking at other translations and the original, as far as I can tell, the version you're reading is a very liberal and modern translation. It is not Verne's original style at all.

ETA: Here is a different translation on Gutenberg. Compare for yourself. http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/3748/pg3748-images.html 




 In this fast-changing world where the components of a tablet or a smartphone are about the worst pollution there is, as compared to trees which are renewable and paper which is recyclable, do you think it's immoral or selfish for an author or a publishing house to create ebooks when there is old technology that can allow anyone to read without destroying the environment?

Studies have shown that you must keep your e-device for 3+ years for there to be any benefit to the environment over paper books. If you replace your device in fewer years than that, paper wins every time. On average, people replace their device every 2 years. 




 I agree with this, and I'm stunned at how positive almost everyone else is being. I don't see one ounce of originality, only typical cop tropes and an attempt to mimic some of the elements from the first season.  




 The information doesn't need to be on Reddit's servers in order for you to be able to click a button that says "sort based on items I have not viewed." Most message boards have this option or some variation of it.

 The quote was in A Raisin in the Sun by Lorraine Hansberry, which was published in 1959. ~~One Hundred Years of Solitude was published in 1967. Not saying he plagiarized it, but it's certainly not a particularly original bit of writing.~~
