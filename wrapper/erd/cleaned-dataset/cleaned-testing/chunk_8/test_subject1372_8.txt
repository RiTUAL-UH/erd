 A big guide? I've been trying to get my ass in gear and make a detailed wiki guide on /r/yugioh101 for weeks. Perhaps you'd like to write some of the missing parts. 




 Looks pretty cool. I think you'll get more feedback if you submit this to /r/customyugioh 




 If you're only selling through ebay, then this should be in the [eBay Listings Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOSales/comments/2rd2bd/ygosaless_official_ebay_listings_thread/). 




 Is there a joke here? Because the necklace does say mom. 




 I read the post. I'm just trying to point out, if playing Smash a bit slower gets you bored, maybe you should hang out with more spacie fags or just avoid playing against her. 




 As long as RNG is used properly, there's nothing wrong with g with it. "What direction should this random chicken go? RNG says 8, so northwest. Now where should it go?" And so on.

But crap like "should I totally miss this enemy again? RNG says 1, so yes. And it keeps saying 1."

And crap like "yeah, your enemy is totally gonna do his almost undodgeable move 3 seconds in instead of 60 seconds in."

There's a right and wrong time for RNG a, and it should always be balanced slightly in the player's favor if it's going to randomly effect difficulty. But, it should never affect if something is winnable. Tester totter around a difficulty level, but not randomly have some shit be really easy and some shot be absurdly difficult.

Candy Crush does it all fucking wrong, AND THEY DO THAT ON PURPOSE. Some people get stuck on level 1. Some on level 14. Some on 212. While some players just breeze past those and get stuck on levels 34 or 56 instead. Who cares? It's random. And King evil-company bitches want you to pay up every time the game randomly sticks you on a level.

Ocarina of time uses the RNG to determine the direction of chickens and Bug's movements. It never makes a chicken impossible to pick up. It never makes a bug go in a random direction when it should go into a patch of soil.

In Majora's Mask (another Zelda game for those who don't know), some bushes drop items or rupees based on RNG. But rupees are never hard to find when you need them. Neither are bombs or arrows or hearts. Especially because some bushes and pots, mostly around soaring points, have definite drops. That's important because when you reset time you lose it all and have to soar right to one of those points. So it's a good thing those points won't screw you over by somehow not dropping what you need. 




 My punish game is horrible, I combo like a noob, I take too long to convert to KO, my neutral game is crappy, I get one good read per play session, and most of my KOs come from my opponent having south damage and me getting either a good hit or throw. 




 Are you kidding? I live that I have so much trouble against Zelda. It's a much different challenge than simply trying to play around a faster character. Zelda is extremely unique in that she has the strongest toolset for a control playstyle. Some other characters have defensive play styles. If everyone was just extremely fast and aggressive, the game wouldn't be so awesomely diverse. It may have well been all Fox final D no items mod.

I feel like everybody complains about slower charavters because it makes the game seem slower. But I don't want everyone to play like a super fast power-house of combos. That seems to be the point of all other fighting games, but not Smash which is more about fast thinking on your feet. Speed Chess if you will. Not to say slower characters don't have the potential to be a part of that game, they can be. But just because your character moves a little faster, doesn't make them superior or better to play. And just because a character is slower doesn't mean they're less fun or inherently defensive and annoying. 

Bowser love to tank through everything, soo being damage through reading and calling out your opponent on their next move. NEWS FLASH, that's how high level smash is played. Fast or slow, general neutral game is about calling out your opponent and conditions g them to do what you want them to do. Converting later into combos and KOs is how the game is won. The best players are the ones who consistently turn a proper neural game into that all important KO. It's why I suck. I hit plenty, but getting a KO I rarely get against higher skilled players.

If you think Zelda is unfun to play against, play against more Zelda players and learn Zelda's common strats and meta game.

 Feedback flair is changed when a mod notices that it needs updating. This is normally when a user tells us their flair needs updating (with a link to his/her thread) or when they send us a link to an updated feedback thread.

 I wouldn't. I'md prevent the creators from totally butchering the God cards. For God's sake, there are level 4 monsters that could easily wipe them out in one way or another and these bastards take 3 tributes to Normal Summon. That's retarded. 




 "I'll get the coat hanger." 




 I seriously think shuffling immediately after your fucking draw should be stopped. By everyone. You haven't even had time to see the card in context of the rest of your hand. Wait a goddamn second and look at it before trying to mindlessly change the order to try to see new strategies. (In my experience and the experience of other players I know, shuffling has never actually help see new plays. It's more of a habit than a strat, and therefore should be toned down.) 




 King Boo. Because MK8 needs more ectoplasm.

But on a wish list basis, why couldn't they bring in Samus and her Gunship? Have a Galaxy circuit.

 Just because you edit, doesn't mean you have to tell us you edited it.

 That's not your job. If someone you're dealing with has a communication problem, you should tell the mods instead of trying to damage that person's reputation. 




 This is a warning. Please stop bothering Champion. I understand you had a lot of time lost from it, but it's not worth bothering others. 




 "Under the sea. Under the sea." 




 The problems I've had with Reddit apps lie within the things we do most often that Reddit apps don't get. Some of them don't let us edit apps, other apps maybe don't actually mark any messages as "read". Some apps don't let me check mod messages or submit text posts. Some of their UIs suck despite being as good as they can be on such a small screen. And I've even encountered apps that don't even let you browse an individual subreddit. I've even seen apps where I can't sort comments by new instead of best. And basically all apps suck if you're a mod of any subreddit and you're trying to mod on mobile. Not to mention, on most of them I've encountered, you can't even see the sidebar. That's important for a lot of subreddits.

Personally, I can't stand any of these apps. None of them offer everything necessary for an avid Reddit browser. I don't use any of them. I actually browse Reddit on the Safari mobile app.

 Having more costumes on a certain character increases the chance of that character being picked. Maybe that has something to do with this. 









 *Yawn and stretch* "What'd I miss?" 




 I can agree. It's sometimes fun seeing the pathetic bot users who have an absurd amount of channels they follow because they're following a lot of bots and spam that's giving them lots of fake followers. Bots and spam that follow me get reported and blocked because I'd rather have 100 real followers than 1,000 fake ones.

Not to mention, channels like "Best Vines" and "Best Voiceovers" that blatantly steal vines and parts of YouTube videos and never offer any credit. It's best to report these as fake accounts and block them. Same for the channels that try to steal other channels by using the same name and profile image on vine.

And of course, just like Myspace and Facebook before it, *EVERYBODY* is going to look at the number of followers or friends they have as a means of popularity and/or self-worth. It's a horrible mentality. I look at the number of followers I have to see if I'm putting out good content. 107 followers is pretty good for the average user. And hey, if a few of them unfollow me because I didn't follow back, then fuck them.

Don't look at vine as another place of social media. It's actually not that social, and you definitely will run into that group of channels that seem to know each other. And don't be afraid to unfollow anybody when their posts stop being like their old posts. I prefer to follow funny viners, so if someone stops being funny to me, I'm definitely going to stop following them. Yeah, I've been disappointed by looking up "funniest" viners lists and seeing the same viners over and over. The worst part is, some of them aren't even funny, but make jokes toward a niche community.

I wish I could find 20 more people worthy of following, but as it stands right now, I can't find many other pages I want to follow. Meanwhile, I'll continue to post a vine almost every day. I edit all my vines, and I love video editing, so I'm glad I've found a place that will let me do something small for what I love every day. 




 "How do you know it was him?"

"His left a note saying 'I masturbated on the corpse' on the corpse." 




 So. All that cloud that was supposed to improve gaming. How's that working out? 




 The PM homebrew launcher assumes you're using a disc. He's trying to load through USB since his disc drive no longer functions properly. 




 You're very welcome. I've been using this method for quite a while and have had to figure out what works and what doesn't. As far as I'm concerned, Loader GX and Wii Flow simply don't work.

Don't forget, with updates, you'll need to once again make sure that SD:\usbloader\codes\ has the updated codes file. Using old codes files can cause glitches and crashes. (I unfortunately discovered that from accidentally playing 3.0 with 2.6b's codes.)

Any other problems, just ask. I'm very glad I could help. 




 Tweaks to Ness to help with his bad match ups like Vs Wolf and Vs Sheik. 




 Use Configurable USB loader. Before you even start your Wii, open your ad card on the computer. In SD:\codes\ you will see a file called rsbe01.gct. Copy this to SD:\usbloader\codes\.

Now go launch CFG on your Wii. Go to Brawl, but don't launch it yet. Go to the settings. Set "Ocarina" to on and set the hook type to "AXNextFrame".

Save your settings and launch the game. It should boot up directly into Project M.

 "Is that Gabe? I thought Jeff fired him."

"He tried, but Jeff is deaf and Gabe doesn't understand sign language." 




 "Lastly, I vow to be the submissive in bed just like you always wanted." 




 Absolutely.
