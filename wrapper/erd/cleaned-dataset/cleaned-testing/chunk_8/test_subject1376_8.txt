 Awesome thanks! 




 Oh thanks that's interesting. Do you have a link I could read more about it?

 Thank you for the feedback, I will continue to refine! 




 Thank you I really appreciate it :) 




 You're a genius 




 Came here to say this. The colors are fantastic! 




 I dig the tv scan lines. 




 That's great, thanks for taking the time to do my survey! I'm aware that one solution isn't for everyone and I appreciate your honesty. 




 I do find it useful thanks! 














 Awesome thanks. If you have a survey you want me to take just point the way. I appreciate your time! 




 I'm very interested in people who suck and want to get better :D

 The original publication date was 1958, this is the 1970 reprint. Maybe they didn't change it from the original. 














 While I agree that the anti-vaccine movement isn't correct, I do understand that for many it is about doing what they feel is best for their kids in line with their own beliefs. I can respect that part of it.

I still try to do the things I wrote about all the time, so I don't think I'm being disingenuous. There are times when I'm required to critique things (UI mockups from the design team for example) and in those situations I do need to look for things that I view as wrong. By practicing what I wrote about however I've trained myself not to **only** look for the things that are wrong. 




 You are absolutely right! When I wrote this I was very into adjectives, obviously :) I published this to get feedback and I appreciate you taking the time to give it to me. I don't feel as though you were criticizing me or my ideas, rather you were telling me about the problems you found with the writing, which I really do appreciate since writing is both a new and scary territory :D 




 I find that if I can take 8 large slow breaths and concentrate on breathing I am able to relax and focus more intentely. It totally helps me :)

There are lots of distractions online that can have a negative impact on my thoughts as well. 




 Yeah totally! I worked on this for a while until I was in control over my own emotions to the point where I knew when I was right in thinking something had fault, as opposed to being defensive and reactionary. Initially though I had a set of thought patterns that I realized I needed to work on. What I found is that even if there is an idea that I don't agree with, that I have reason to criticize, I am now able to find some points that I do agree on. Most of the time anyway :) The times when I can't find a single thing to agree on I can at least agree that the person conveying the ideas is trying and putting in the work to convey their ideas, which is in itself a very positive thing. 




 "...it takes time to not immediately curl up and get defensive."

Yes, totally this. Great point. It's hard to take time to think before responding. Thank you for the constructive comment as well, you're right that I need to work on my editing :) 




 I've actually been doing strength training for the last year and I have to say that it really does help. Speaking in front of a mirror is one I haven't tried, thanks for that tip :D 




 * Do not criticize, condemn or complain, this begins with your thoughts.  
* Practice patience, in all things.  
* Practice empathy, with everyone.  
* Be honest to yourself and then with others.  

These are the main things I try to work on and remember every day. I wrote my thoughts down a few years ago and finally got the nerve to [publish them](https://medium.com/@ryanallen_com/become-a-better-designer-and-person-by-learning-to-listen-f23ef9bef9b2).

#Become a Better INSERT JOB TITLE HERE and Person by Learning to Listen  

Patient, honest, empathetic, and non-judgemental thoughts will have an incredibley profound impact on your career, your relationships and your overall well-being.

There is no single act or idea that can fix all of your problems. There are acts and ideas that can pivot you into new, and passion-filled life adventures however. This could very well be one of those ideas, if only you act.

Consider how becoming a better listener will help you become a better designer, instead of the designer who argues with everyone and is difficult to work with. Consider how the seemingly simple act of practicing patient, non-judgemental, and engaged listenting will help you become more well-liked, focused, and more aware of frivolous abstractions in an effort to find and move closer to your true self.

How can you do this?

##Admit When You Are Wrong

To listen with patience and acceptance requires an inner strength to notice your fears and understand where they are coming from, while at the same time actively listening to and engaging, but not interrupting, the speaker. You need to practice and develop the courage to listen with an open mind to other peoples ideas, while also realizing your own ideas may be wrong. To achieve honesty with yourself you must begin by [not criticizing, condemning, or complaining](http://dalecarnegieboston.tumblr.com/post/20350676146/dont-criticize-condemn-or-complain) both externally and internally.

To listen without patience, acceptance, and an honest open mind, results in a tenacity and stubborn resistance to change, with an unwillingness to acknowledge defeat not only to the speaker, but to yourself. This fear is born from your unwillingness to practice courageous mental strength, honesty, and empathy, and prevents you from being flexible in many situations and unable to empathize and grow as a person both personally and professionally.

##Building a Foundation Based on Empathy, Patience and Honesty

In order to cultivate an empathetic, patient, and fearless open mind, you must begin with empathy. In order to sound honest, patient, and sincere you must be and act honest, patient, and sincere. It helps many people to pretend, make-believe, or act. Eventually it becomes an honest part of you. You will slowly find yourself not having to act, you will just be.

"Im curious about other people. Thats the essence of my acting. Im interested in what it would be like to be you." Meryl Streep

Only when you are able to become more aware and actively use and control your own emotions, will you be able to develop a deep sense of collaboration and respect for your speaker, even if you never fully accept their ideas as your own.

##Be Honest With Yourself

Before you can become a better person you must practice patient listening. Before becoming a patient listener you must focus on actively accepting the speakers ideas, philosophies, and words by actively practicing empathy with everyone you can remember to practice it with.

What is empathy? You can only begin to understand and actively practice empathy with others by accepting their words, ideas, and ultimately their true being. To do this you must first acknowledge, understand, and then accept your own true being. You must believe in yourself before you are able to accept belief from others. You must believe in the value of your own words, ideas, and feelings before you can believe in another persons feelings, ideas, and words.

You must begin to take ownership of your own actions and admit to your failings. Failures are how you learn.

"Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they cant lose.[Bill Gates](https://twitter.com/billgates)

By admitting to your shortcomings and fully owning your actions you will begin to build the solid foundation that is the new you. The better you. The patient, accepting, and wise you.

##When Two Become One

I told you that you have the potential to become a better person by becoming a better listener, but I havent yet told you how. The answer to that isnt one you will understand by the end of this article. It is an answer that will take a lifetime of practiced social interractions to truly make itself known to you. Interractions where you and your partner, even if just for a few fleeting moments, merge into a singular abstract personality where an almost complete understanding is shared between you.

This understanding takes place in almost every conversation we have. It is a fundamental process in love, patience, and a bettering of our very human nature. Sometimes we are just so intensely interested in our own thoughts that we fail to notice. In summation, remember:

* Do not criticize, condemn or complain, this begins with your thoughts.  
* Practice patience, in all things.  
* Practice empathy, with everyone.  
* Be honest to yourself and then with others  

 









 Great job on the different speeds of the background parts, it's a great touch that really adds depth!
