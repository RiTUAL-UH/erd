Subject #2907

Class: Fertile

Topic: Inveigle

Transcript of Recording

 nbsp;

Martin Howard: Anyway, I think we should pick up where we left off. Maybe sometime after you found the tape. Do you remember what happened next?

Subject #2907: Im not divulging anymore information until I can make a phone call.

Martin Howard: Say again?

Subject #2907: Im not telling you shit until I can call someone.

MH: Well, you see, you calling someone would defeat your purpose here.

2907: What, I cant get better unless Im completely cut off from my loved ones?

MH: Its a complicated process.

2907: Look, no one knows how my body responds better than I fucking do. And if that date is correct [sound of chair scraping back], if that fucking calendar isnt a joke like everything else is in this goddamn place, then my family hasnt heard from me in over two months. And Id like to NOT be a shitty daughter for once and let my fucking family know that Im not dead!

MH: [NAME REMOVED], please calm down.

2907: Ill fucking calm down when I get a fucking phone call!

[metal slamming into metal]

[recording paused]

[recording continued]

MH: Do you understand? [NAME REMOVED], do you understand? I need you to respond.

2907: [muffled] Yes.

MH: Good, Im glad we were able to make that clear for you. Now, lets begin again.

2907: Where?

MH: Whatever significant event happened after finding the VHS tape.

2907: I...went back to the forest.

MH: Which part?

2907: Where I found it. By the [[REMOVED]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dr8qk/languish/)

MH: Did you find anything else?

2907: No. But then I entered the coordinates into my GPS -

MH: What coordinates?

2907: The ones I found under the false bottom of the tin.

MH: You didnt mention that earlier.

2907: You said significant part next.

MH: Yes, I did. [NAME REMOVED], I hope youre not lying to me, or hiding anything from me. 

2907: What? Im not.

MH: Because if you were -

2907: I get it, alright? Im just trying to be as accurate as possible. Obviously my brain is a little fucked after everything that happened, so I may forget tiny details here and there.  Is that okay with you?

MH: Perhaps youre being too hostile today. Should we put you back in your room and leave you alone for another day?

2907: No.

MH: Thats what I thought. What did you find at the other coordinates?

[door opening]

MH: Yes, what do you want?

[UNIDENTIFIED VOICE]: Subject 2907 is to return to her room at this time.

MH: Well, tell them were not finished yet.

[UNIDENTIFIED VOICE]: Sir, by orders of Lieutenant Kernel Harrison, Subject 2907 may only have forty-five minutes of social interference a day. I have been instructed to -

MH: Alright, alright, fine. Take her. Ill be speaking to Harrison shortly. Well see you next week, [NAME REMOVED].

[UNIDENTIFIED VOICE]: Is she not responding?

MH: Shit. Get the nurses, tell them to bring [REMOVED]. Now! 

[recording paused]

[recording continued]

MH: Weekly log for Subject 2907. Subject was uncooperative for most of her session today, but was able to continue after expressing concerns of what she could do to her loved ones. Before we were able to get anywhere, though, her session ended. She was about to be escorted back to her room when she became catatonic, a side effect of the treatments. I do not think she will last long in this facility with how quickly her mental state is deteriorating. We must get her back into the field as soon as possible if we are to reap the fruits of our work anytime soon.
