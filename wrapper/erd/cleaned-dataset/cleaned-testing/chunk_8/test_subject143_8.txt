 I wonder what they look like without the black fur around the eyes. 




 You get about 7 levels per craft to 400, too lazy to work it out  




 No.

Source: I've checked 




 A pen and paper, easiest method. ;) 




 Yeah perhaps you're right about that, I do hope things work out for you two, and don't take advice from anyone who says "End it now" no one can understand the situation better than you or your SO do, although sexting with my GF does feel a little silly when I'm not in the mood. 




 I've had a period like this for about a month some time ago when I wasn't feeling good about my performance in the bedroom and my confidence in general when it came to sex got quite low because of it and anything to do with sex such as sexting and talking about it just brought me down because I knew I couldn't perform in the bedroom, I don't know if this might be the case with him but perhaps he's just not feeling as confident as he used to be?  




 Hahaha that sounds ridiculous thank you for the info I'll be steering clear of those two. 




 Thanks for the offer but I'm not really familiar with the Wirral and I'd probably end up getting lost just trying to find my way around haha 




 Finally looking to start learning how to drive, any one have any schools they can recommend, not sure of the reputations some have. 




 No, that's a tree 




 You've hit the nail on the head here i guess what it is that i'm most scared of was like you said the guy being better at this than i am, i feel like i would take that the wrong way and knock my confidence, it's not an easy decision to make, losing all control and allowing this to happen.

The part you explained about stepping back has really gave me a new perspective on how to look at it, thinking of it that way i don't get as angry as i would normally, i guess i picture myself in the point of view of the other guy and that's not the best thing to do.

I do need to work on my own insecurities and overthinking the situation and i think i can do it, you've helped me out more than you realise but i know i'm not going to change over night, but at least i have a new perspective to think about, thank you. 




 Admittedly i have had a bad day today so perhaps it seems a bit exagerated, but i don't think your comment is fair, just because i feel this way now does not mean i can't change my outlook by working on it. 




 Yeah i've thought about that but at the same time i don't want to hold her back from new experiences or myself for that matter! 




 Thank you for your reply, I'll talk to her about this later on, but i feel like she'll just think i'm simply asking for this for my own pleasure rather than to help with the jealousy, I will try to explain it to her as best i can and hopefully she will understand.

But what if even after my experience i still feel too jealous, i would feel absolutely horrible denying her the experience that i had, and i'm sure she would be upset if i did that after her allowing me to have a threesome with two girls. 




 So my SO is interested in group sex and i'm not entirely against it myself, but even just the thought of another guy touching my SO makes me angry, like shaking with rage angry, and even if she jokingly says something about another guy to purposely annoy me it REALLY pisses me off.

So i guess what i'm asking is how can I get over the jealousy so we can try new things, i know i'm not ready now but how can i make that first step? 




 Has there been any mention of what new weapon the necromancer will get? I know we've seen a few in the trailer what else haven't we seen? 




 Yeah it's good imo, I enjoyed it at least and found it a pretty interesting look into something people rarely think about when they go to Aquariums or Zoo's.

 Rest In Peace in peace photographer 









 Lots of people i've talked to are reccomending this place, had a look myself it's looking like this might be the place!
