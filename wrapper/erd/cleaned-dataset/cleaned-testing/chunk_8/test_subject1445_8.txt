 Oh right, I forget that there is a drinking age sometimes.  Eh, once you pass 21 instead of being like "let's lower the drinking age so all these younger people can drink!"  you're like "oh screw it, I had to wait that long to for it to be legal"  




 Yup, thank you random internet stranger :)  If you're in the southwestern US ish area, I'll grab a beer with you!  Highly unlikely you're in my area though haha.
