 As an external SSD, It can't be detected by a different computer. On the original desktop, it is showing on BIOS. Boot sector seems corrupted or something. Is there any fix to that? 




 It's dead even if BIOS detects it? 




 1. Tried that...didn't fix the problem...
2. Will try this as my last option...
3. Tried that. It doesn't work as well...

Thank You. 




 -BIOS detects it and it is set as the priority boot. No other HDD installed.
- Getting this  " Run and Select proper boot Device"
- I have already tried DISKPART. When I checked for disk list it only shows disk 0.
- OS is Windows 7 Ultimate.
- eliminated SATA cable and power cables as culprit.
