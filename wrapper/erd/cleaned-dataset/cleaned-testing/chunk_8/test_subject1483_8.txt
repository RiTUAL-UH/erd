 Chick teacher. 




 Never finished this game, got stuck in the garage with [this](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20141025190101/the-evil-within/images/8/8b/Amalgam_alpha.jpg) mofo 




 Kill it with fire, seriously. 




 A senior student fucked a teacher up the pooper and when he pulled his dick out he swore he had a piece of corn stuck on his dick.


And so it was that Ms.Cornhole was baptised. 




 ooooo 117 days to my cake day! 




 **DING** **DING** **DING** WINNER WINNER, CHICKEN DINNER!! 




 Never that long, by day 4 I would've gotten a couple of matches in at least but not too many. You seem to be severely affected. 




 It lets me open the app and do a "search" but it never finds any videos and there's none on the home page either. Been like that for months! 




 Unlike the women officer, screams in fear when he gets the gun out and whilst she's escorting him outside "do you wanna know what page we're on? Step outside, that's what page we're on".....what? 




 That answers that then. ^^The ^^more ^^you ^^know^^^w^^^^w^^^^^w 




 You go America!!! hopefully Europe will follow soon. **FUCK PROHIBITION!!** 




 **ONLY AVAILABLE IN US AND CANADA** ...what a stupid move. 




 **WHERE IS THE GAME?** I can't find it on the xbox store.. 




 I love cuttlefish but after seeing a documentry on them I fell a bit bad about eating them. They are amazingly intelligent and delicious creatures. 




 /r/oddlysatisfying 




 All i know is I would be soooooooo pissed off if my brother and I got that and I was stuck with the boring top bunk. 




 Sonic has been in the wrong *game* since the sega days. 




 So my youtube app is basically broken. I've uninstalled and re-installed millions of times with nothing to show for it but a broken youtube app.


Anybody else having the same problem?



Any solutions available? 




 Now if only my youtube app worked... 




 Muchas Gracias!! 




 Dude I just realised your username...I live on your cock. 




 I'm event hesitant on pre-ordering that one since the fuck up with MCC, but I really want that statue...decisions!! 




 I'd still prefer the standard black, for $150 I don't want a design I'm going to get tired of. 




 I knew I'd seen it before! 




 Step one: acquire windows 10...



....anddd I failed. 




 I would not pre-order. I'm in the wrong post aren't I? 




 **FTFY** Researchers find **that** flatworms plunge their penises into their own heads to inject themselves with sperm.


 




 He's not saying it doesn't take time and effort to build. He's saying it seems cheap and I agree. It's like bringing a gun to a knife fight, it's so over powered compared to all the other battle bots weaponry. It should be made illegal or like I mentioned further up the thread regulated so the props can only be of a certain length therefore removing these helicopter like monstrosities.  




 How about you regulate the size of shafts on a rotating axis (ie if it's going to be spinning around, it can't be longer than x inches) You would still have spinning robots but not these ridiculous land helicopters of death. 




 You guys keep bringing swords to gun fights. 




 If you play with your friends the Hasbro games are quite fun. Risk, Monopoly and now Scrabble has just been released.
 




 The vault isn't "wow" I agree but there are still some good game to enjoy. What else do you want for $30 measly dollar a year?? You lose more than that in change every year and for that price you're also getting 10% discount on any up coming games, it really is a no brainer if you're a gamer. 




 I get it randomly, sometimes it pisses me off so much I just bash out the campaign but yea I still get it more often than not. TBH I'm done with MCC, hopefully 5 will not be this much of a mess. 




 Any preview members fancy inviting me to the party?? 




 **Only works for the Americas.** Outside of the continent you need a code. 




 Have you guys learned nothing? 




 On a side note, how is the coach co-op on this game?? Are the tiles visible to all players looking at the screen?? 




 Maybe you were just unlocking the achievements and she wasn't (i.e you were doing all the steps required and she was just kinda there?). I don't know how it works just stating a possibility. 




 It's been in our lives for so long that I'm sad to see it go, maybe we should throw it a going away party. ^^^^^^^^/s 




 i would recommend ESO. Destiny imo you need to play with friends to ~~enjoy~~ make it bearable. 




 Of course, people will take anything if it's free. More than 3/4 quarters never played after the first 5 minutes and I didn't even open mine. 




 Apart from Banjo-Kazooie I'm on the same boat. Can't freaking wait!! 




 I'm currently hooked on Risk and Monopoly and definatley going to buy this one but how will this work with coach co-op? Could you let me know before I purchase?

 




 That's awesome, I'm currently hooked on Risk and Monopoly but how will this work with coach co-op? Could someone let me know before I purchase? 




 There are already, gun, clothes and cars. We want something *new*. 




 That **and** the Los Santos Customs money making glitch. You would sell you car, exit to Story mode then quickly go back to online. You would find yourself outside the LSC in your car with the money in your pocket. Rinse and repeat.


Money was really no biggie when the game first came out, I had millions stored away in case of a rainy day. 




 At least you sold it, I just dropped it on the floor in front of him. 




 I'm a tiger, roar. 




 reading his thread hurt that pink thing inside my skull. 




 OOOOoooooooo!!!! 




 Where? (   ) 




 *sploooooooshhhh*


Clean up on isle Dick. I repeat clean up on isle Dick, there's been an unexpected leak. 




 Dude it's the "secret sauce". 




 I'm sorry, but it's my drink and I do with it as I please. That "rule" is fucking absurd I can't wrap my head around it. 




 To all the people calling this fake, have you ever been on a cliff side in your life? you can stand a metre away from the edge and feel nothing, yet peak your head over the edge and you will be eating some wind for lunch. 




 Ayyyyyy ^^Pretty ^^Mama!
 




 The answer to gifs is pretty much work. I'm at work and cannot play videos because I may need to hear them, with a gif I know I won't miss out on anything. 




 Well it kinda is one of Clevelands thing soo yeah. 




 On one hand his a bit of a dick but on the other hand, free cookies..Really makes you think. 




 Man I wish I had weekend weekends, sounds awesome. 









 I was like that last year, now I'm on Xbox everyday like I used to be. Change it up a bit, play games you wouldn't think of playing. Right now I'm hooked on Guacamelee and Risk believe it or not. Before that it was a couple weeks of witcher 3, you just gotta keep it fresh or take a break. The bug will bite again soon enough. 




 I got one of these calls last week. I pretended to be the Prince of Nigeria, good times.

 Reddit you're killing me



Awesome! 




 Meh, enjoy it while it lasts. I guarantee in a couple of years ~~they will be totally kicking your ass in Halo and every other FPS.
Sauce: Dad of 13-year-old who kicks my ass regularly in Halo and every other FPS.~~ their wont be any split screen games left, especially Halo. 




 Many poops came out of that ani! 




 False! Try again. I'm in Gibraltar. 




 Right? Like where there hell are kids learning to speak so well at such a young age? Evolution in action I guess. 




 I used to go to school with a Gary Nolast Name, good kid! 




 Give Mr.T an axe and a chainsaw and lets be done with it! 




 The silent credits at the end really hit home that it is over :c 




 Nice touch for the intro, did you guys pick it up?? 




 I'm guessing you haven't gotten to Skellige yet??
 




 REKT! 




 Also works for fap time! 




 My favourite part was the title. 




 If you want to continue sleeping, don't pick this game up. 




 The original pictures are always better than the submissions. 




 Damn I was born in the wrong country. Got a coach I could borrow bud?? 




 You're tongue is dead then, I tried some american chocolate a few days ago (Hershie). How can you willingly eat that stuff? The Yorkie bars the army gets in their Field Rations taste better than that! 




 This is the moment where my car transforms into a people-mower. 




 **GO SNOWBALL!!** 




 Intro - "I love my kids, gay, kellogg's cornflakes, bullocks..*whistles*"

Strap in and enjoy the ride! 




 That umbrella through the window, comedy gold! 




 Haven't seen this in years! This guy is just surreal. 




 He took the dookie in the urinal! 




 That place is really not suitable for humans. 




 **NO** **NOO** **NOO!**

 **FEELTALITY** 




 What happened in my mind.


Guy comes into the bathroom, yanks the door open, sends OP flying off the toilet crashing face first to the ground incidentally knocking OP out. Op is now out cold face first and poop smeared butt sticking up winking and this poor man who just needed the loo.  




 One word - digital. 




 Well that's just like your opinion I guess. 




 Adult babies?

 He did what?...*raises pitchfork* 




 Don't worry you're not the only one. I keep getting emails but for the wrong GT. I've tried twice via chat and have gotten no where. I keep getting emails telling me that this month I have gained fuck all because I don't use that GT. 




 You should really give Sunset Overdrive a go. It's so refreshing! 




 LPT: A good kick will solve your problems....Road House! 




 Work phone rings;


**Me**: Hello?


**Little Indian Bastard**: Good day sir, I'm calling you from [god knows where he said] today to tell you that your system is running very slow at the moment...


**Me**: I know, it's because I'm sending out a lot of emails at the moment. I'm trying to find someone to help me.


**Little Indian Bastard**: I can help you sir!


**Me**: Perfect! My name is Prince Naboodoo from Nigeria, and I need your help to transfer 10 millio-*click*....Hello?


**TDLR**: Me -1  Little Indian Bastard -0 
 




 **FINALLY** I now understand why vertical videos exist. 




 You sir, are correct! Just played a few matches whilst slowing the pace down. This is the halo I remember, slowly but surely it's all coming back! 




 Thing is I was used to it. I was an avid Halo 3 player but it has been a veryyyyy long time since I played and I had forgotten it didn't have sprint, threw my game plan off. 




 I'm probably going to get massacred with the downvote blade of death but I've grown not to like Halo 3. The only reason being, no sprinting. I had forgotten that Halo 3 didn't have sprint, ended up dying so many times because instead of running into cover he was casually strolling in. I really don't know how I used to play. 




 I'm not a fan but my friend is. Came to my house yesterday and explained how he screeched like little girl when man bat showed up. 




 So does this mean we can "borrow" the idea? 




 And this is not news either, the rumour has been around for a few months. 




 Never ending story^y^^y^^^y^^^^y 




 Has it been two weeks **already**??
