 Surprised nobody in my FC has done this yet, tbh. 




 I politely disagree with Pennie not being the "best fit" for the band, because he was a lot better both technically and with understanding the band's dynamic range - better than most people off the street. As a live drummer for them for as many years as he had been, he was a good fit after Josh left and didn't really change the original rep too much. Yes Guns of Summer has a ton of technicality to it, but Pennie used to be in Dillinger Escape Plan, so it's not inherently surprising. For the most part, though, dude just kept time and did his job. Lol
I personally think that they started experimenting more with electronic sounds more because of Pennie (dude has a degree from Berklee in Music Production, I believe), which has helped their Afterman sound be what it is, but I think YOTB as a whole was such a drastic "experimental" turn from previous records that most Coheed fans wrote it off. There is some good stuff there, though. Minus the songs that were singles except for Juggernaut. Wasn't feeling them too much.  




 Same! I got legit excited. That bassline is phenomenal! 




 Plumbers. I'll see myself out.  




 This I don't understand. I've stolen aggro from the MT who isn't Halone combining or mixing in flashes (for PLD, anyway). It's frustrating.  




 Tank, can confirm.  




 Pre-orders should've been in last week. Gf's moogle came in last Friday.  




 What a story, Mark! Haha
