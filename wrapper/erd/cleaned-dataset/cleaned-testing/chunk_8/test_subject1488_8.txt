 well, most people. 




 saw that coming from a mile away.  




 Why would you kill someone that 1) is willing to give you oral sex, and 2) is so concerned with your well being that will take you to the hospital when you smell bad? 




 I love working with my hands, putting things together, doing arts/crafts, etc. I need something new, something I can pick up fairly quickly with a little bit of research, and that will MAKE ME MONEY. Some crafts can be sold online but ETSY is oversaturated. I was thinking of making computers but I think that is something I wouldn't get the hang of, plus it cost a lot of money. I'm broke, my job isn't paying, and I do nothing all day, everyday. 

If you know a better sub that could help, please direct me! thanks!! 




 Kava, magnesium supplements, GABA. try these.

buspar is pretty good though, try it.  




 I just wrote this long response but it got deleted. Basically, yes it does take a while to build up but for me, its different than cymbalta or something. I can tell which days I do or don't take it, and recognize its effects. Other than Xanax, there is a very popular pill (I think a benzo) that is nonaddictive and often prescribed because of this. I can t remember its name off the top of my head but you can search for it and do your own research. Allergy pills can affect your brain like Xanax, so it could be used as a quick fix.  




 Good to hear. I'm thinking of coming off mine for the same reasons as above! 




 That sounds like something to bring to a higher up. Good for you for leaving, I would have told them to go fuck themselves. 




 Arms because I'd take that idiosyncrasy and rock it. 




 What's the job? 




 Yeah I love that they care and ask me if i need I talk but the only people that understand are people that have gone through it or are currently struggling. Everyone knows my dirty laundry, but not it's extent.

Giving you advice would be hypocritical fit me because I'm stuck in this cycle as well. I don't care about anything including myself and gave up on getting better. You need someone, done meds, and to push yourself to make memories and do things. 

Also, having a drink is fine, everyone gets through the day in their own way, but it's a depressant. Alcohol makes me want to kill myself and everyone I know that has depression (not many open people) feels worse when drinking. Just food for thought. Msg me if you'd like to talk. 




 Kratom. It's legal. 




 Witness protection? 




 To find our purpose in life. 




 Thanks :) it's the truth too. 




 Yeah I learned this about myself, i need/love physical work but who's going to hire me? I don't look strong or helpful. Idk where to look. 




 Sometimes the universe shits on you all at once. Repair yourself one by one. Check /r/assistance  




 Side note: The word "ugh" singlehandedly describes depression. 




 WTF are we going to do? Ugh 




 A critique. 




 Have you thought of digital design or communication design? My high school counselor suggested I make my own major and mix music and art. I forgot what it's called 




 Is this Canada? Just guessing because there aren't pennies anymore? 




 Used to call my own cell phone and let it vibrate. Repeatedly. 




 Did 3/4 




 And all sell dope 




 Can you send it to me 3 




 Well Friday in my case. It's still awesome. Who doesn't love money being put in your bank account?!?! 




 Message me when you find an answer because I'm right there with you. 




 Any antidepressant will have people that say good or bad things about it. It depends on the person and what they respond to, and other factors in their life. I'm on it now and gets me out of bed, no anxiety, but makes me feel nothing. But, in a way I'm back to my old self, as far as personality. It's the best out of the 3 I have tried, but do not feel happy at all. I was prescribed welbutrin in addition for energy and getting my emotions back but I feel it makes things worse and stopped. 




 Can I have a picture of said butt? 




 You're not going to know unless you ask. 




 Baby momma. It's not really known as one of the best comedies and gets pushed over but I love it. Amy and tina together are the best! 




 Cookies because every cookie is awesome.

Otc meds. If you read the label, it's usually the same chemical and dose, just store brand vs name brand. 




 There is an online community that hosts online overeaters anonymous meetings, like 3x per day. I think they have other ED online meetings for various types. I wish I wasn't on my phone and could find it.. But it's out there! Please seek help! 




 "Dad." 




 Mingle with your coworkers. Even if you don't love them, it's still is something to do, they can introduce you to people, force you to get out, and improves morale. Be friendly with your neighbors in your apt and see if they're your age. Go to a bar, even if you don't drink, and talk with the bartenders. It will help with the loneliness. Join a gym and see if they have classes and you may meet someone. If you tell them your new they may assist you and will give you something to do. All these things will ease loneliness and make you feel at home. Maybe volunteer a day or two a week somewhere like a music venue or something you're into. 




 I know someone that does. She said she doesn't love it but has been there forever and gets paid a hefty amount. Monday through Friday she is traveling, weekends she goes home. Obviously this isn't every job in the industry but something to think about. 




 Damn. All I knew was about drugs. This sickens my mood. 




 Nice. I'm going to be moving from the east to west coast next year. Idk. I believe you should take chances and do whatever makes you happy. I think a lot of people say that but don't act on it... 




 Yeah. Scariest thing is when a dealer sees you and tells you to stop buying. Stop while you're ahead. Seriously. Make a change. 




 Yes!! I saw part of it and it was so relatable but uplifting at the same time. I didn't finish it all but it's another way to look at things when life goes in different directions. 




 I barely felt anything. It was my first time and wanted to be safe. I felt the weed/alcohol high people say it feels like but wasn't too strong. But yeah, I checked the dosing and for my weight that's right in the phase 1 dose. 




 Oooh. Sorry. Misread. You can try welbutrin alone but I take it with an ssri, I don't like it but MOST people swear on this drug and call it legal crack. Give it a try 




 Never did it 




 Did it. 




 Did it 




 Ask about welbutrin. Eliminates side effects from SSRIs. Or try a lower dose. Or just get off them all together and control your anxiety naturally. You may not need. 




 Because in these movies the actresses are skinny little things and can't produce breasts, but it's also modest because they look like a guys chest.  




 I've always used WhatsApp and Facebook messenger to communicate. And then just googled "bar near me" or something and it will give you a name and directions for getting around. Are you using public transport? They may have an app for their system or site you may want to save to look at after.  




 Used to be a coffee addicted. Now I drink it once or twice a month. Doesn't pep me up, but does taste like shit now. Tastes like rotten seeds and dirt were brewed. Which is somewhat accurate. Can barely get it down, where u thought it was the best flavor EVER a year ago 




 Message me your pay stub/proof of employment and license and I'll help ya 




 Um yes. You do. I live right by the peace bridge. You say these things. 




 Not me 




 My grandpa 




 I think they were roxis. I called to get like 5 pills. He was in a rough spot and kinda fucked up that day and I ended up paying 2x what I wanted to spend, but getting 25 pills. He as like "do you just want my last ones?" Okayyyy 




 Right now he doesn't come again. 




 You should look into a parks job in your town. Or YMCA. You may be young but next year you could do something.  




 I don't train myself. I am who I am and let myself be attracted to whoever! No restraints, just intelligence. 




 Same with my niece. We limited the juice and changed to water or milk so she would start eating more because it filled her up. Didn't work too well. I'm worried, she hasn't grown and doesn't eat. :(  I can understand people that like feet and think they're attractive or like them being rubbed but some shit is cray. 




 How'd you get the job? I think bartending would be awesome and I'd be great at it but I don't drink so don't know combos and not the best conversationalist/looker. I love concoctions though and remember stuff quick! 




 Ooh some have raise hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some raise 0. Try it though, its easy to set up. I could even do it for you and the money would be sent to your account.  




 I hope he comes soon 




 Darien lake campgrounds. 




 Savings. Good job. I would never buy a 300k house at my age. I could buy a house but that sounds ridiculous. Around here, the nicest houses are 250k, anything above we consider luxurious and unnecessary. At this point, I dont plan on buying a house unless I plan to live there for 10+years starting a family and career. Sounds stupid to me but I'm a minimalist. Id be more than happy with a 1000ft house for 120k IF I knew I'd live their for a while. 




 Hey there's more than just being a vet! What do you like to do? Like, let's get to the bottom here, do you like planning? Meeting people from over the world? Entertaining? Conservation? Nature?
