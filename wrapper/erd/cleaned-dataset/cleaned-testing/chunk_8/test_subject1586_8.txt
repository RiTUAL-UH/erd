 Oh, I'm not Abrahamic. 




 God: I put your testicles outside your body in a place that is easy to kick, because sometimes you deserve to be kicked in the nuts. You know what you do. You know you have it coming. And I gave you a useless organ that can kill you,  because sometimes you need killed. 




 God: My child, I use evolution to create that which I want to come into existence. Time is an operating principle of the universe that even I cannot escape. It takes time and intent to create. When you want to create something, you have to get the tools together and work with the materials to create that which you have imagined. I must do the same. So do not fear it there bones under the grass, or that there are stars above with the promise of other races. I have many pallets, and many tools and I take my time to make everything perfect. Because every creation I make is special, and important. Just like you. 




 Totes isn't actually in the uniform code.  




 Bleacher Report mobile links don't work on reddit. Its Dumb 




 I'm in no way against new unis. I agree with everything you said. Still terrified.  




 The US is in no place to help Poland, or anyone, economically. Comparritively, we're the ones who need financial help,  not Poland. And Finland is small, but they kicked Russian Ass in the big war.  




 Germany can take the blame for some of it. Though they can take the blame for the current surge in Polands economy too, so there's that.   




 Well, Poland remembers what happened last time they were told that things would be fine with Russia. 




 I had to see if it was just me. Literally the reason I opened up the comments on here. Why, indeed? 




 Our colors and concept are CLASSIC. Jim Brown referred to our jerseys as "The Yankee Pinstripes of American Football" Most Browns fans know that in our bones, without having to be told it. This is why most Browns fans are scared about the change. *edit spelling* 




 Every sub has different rules they have agreed upon for fair play. You break those rules, you need a mod to have the power to enforce them. Kinda like pirate ship hierarchy. The are first among equals. Everyone is on the same level until someone needs to be in charge. Then they are.

 I REALLY want to do this.

1: We Bark Together

2: Seattle

3: I cannot do international. I am a minister and my personal funds are way limited.

4: I am a vet of reddit secret santa, but I have not done Drafts for the Draft.

5: After getting really drawn into the craziness of the new Browns energy, I had to find a bigger community. Being a displaced Clevelander is hard. 10 years in ATL, and now I live (hopefully forever) outside of Seattle in the mountains. I am wearing a Browns shirt and orange shorts in San Fran in China Town as we speak.



 




 When his heart is true, all luck's his. 




 I was recently having a conversation with a friend of mine about this. He was upset that Trestman went to the Ravens. He was talking about how he should come home to the Browns, the history of Trestman in Cleveland, and eventually why we cant get those guys to come back. It finally hit me during that conversation. As much as I hate the Ravens when you ask the old timers to come back and help the Browns, their friends arent in Berea. When they think of the old times, they think of Ozzy Newsome and the staff of the Browns Pre-95. All of Trestmans friends from the old days are in Baltimore. One day we will be back to being a contender, but I fear that we wont ever be what we were.

 Joe Haden is exactly the success story Gordon could have been. He proves the adage *It's not our mistakes, but what we do after them that define our character*

 I've been reading your backlogs and I think you might be a racist. You know what one of the perks of being in Cleveland is? We're not Detroit. If you bring that racist shit in here, you're gonna have a bad time of it, trolio.  




 Makes me wonder just how low you want the Karma on your profile. 




 I own this beer can holder! 




 As a Browns fan who lives in a culture that can't seem to find a QB in any round,  especially the first round, I just can't help but wonder how Belichick found a person at round 6 of his calibre? Can anyone with a better knowledge of these things explain it to me?

 Those classes you paid for are helping. 




 Aliexpress.com I have been really happy with the quality, and the price. I have 3 jerseys for the price of one. One day I would like to have an official one, but every piece of official licensed NFL gear I have ever owned has been put together poorly, or broke the first couple times I wore it. AliExpress is good stuff for the fan on a budget with a lot of time to wait on the mail. 




 White Thomas 73! 









 I just don't like LeBron, but I root for Cleveland teams. Hell, I'd rock Cleveland Crush shirt if I could find one. 




 Haden is also just a regular old descent player according to this, as well. 




 Unlike the reality of Squatching, this picture is a joke. Jokes are made to help people feel light hearted about serious subjects. I'm sorry that many if you are too beat up by the scientific community to find this funny. **posted by a guy who really believes in Bigfoot, and also thinks this post is funny** 









 He ruined our receiving corps when he got back. I would rather have all those short, big hearted, dynamic, hungry, recievers, than one amazingly elite, physically gifted, screw off.  




 Just move to Washington. Start a growing co-op 




 Yeah. Less eyebleach,  and more mentally snapped owl hugging its dropped body part.  




 I heard Shaw was so injured going into game 16, that he passed blood after the game. And he still played. That's chops.  




 O 




 Kent State Alumni is okay by me. 




 I have not done Drafts for the Draft, yet! I live in the Pacific North West (PNW) and have access to some good stuff that isn't in Ohio!
 




 I thought that you all may enjoy this article that I wrote. Happy gaming, Players! 














 I said "Hope". 




 And Cribbs 




 Ospreys repeat! I live in Sea-Town, so it's gonna be a hell of a party, tonight. 




 I love Josh Cribbs. I hope the Colts blow New England away. 




 I need to make more accounts so I can upvote this as much as it deserves to be upvoted.

 This is a really good article on Pettine. It gets a little personal on Manziel, Gilbert, and Gordon at the end, but I thought his view of Pettine was solid.  









 Yeah. Sans Billy Boy.  




 Yis. This
 




 I was pulling for Trestman to be our HC. I REALLY think we lucked out with Pettine, but think we have a spot on our roster for him to be the OC or QB Coach. I like him, his history with Cleveland, and his resume from the CFL. We could use some of that old school Browns energy back in the building. Especially when it has left and had success abroad..
 




 Do it through selective breeding.  




 Upvote for your name. 




 Pettine's might have made 2 or 3 mistakes all year. You can't mess with Pettine. He is the best coach since 99 and maybe even back into pre-relocation a ways. 




 I have heard that he was so agro in the locker room, that he couldn't win the hearts of the players

 Don't they know not to invest in first year QB gear from Cleveland? 




 I went with a White Joe Thomas Rookie Year Edition Jersey! Thanks for the help, all!
 




 No sleep and driving the girl child to the airport 2 hours away for a 12pm check in.  




 That's funny right there. Thanks for the tip!
 




 That brings up a good question. should I have my Jerseys Dry Cleaned, or can they be machine/hand washed?
 




 I feel the same way. Weird. 




 No. Totes was MadLibs. Check it out "You can *Verb* my *Noun* and run your *Noun* around the rim of my *Noun*".

All jokes aside, I just thought it was interesting. Hence the part where it says
Coincidence? Yes. 




 This is the thought that has me caught up. I really like the white ones too. I think they're sharp. I'm just a nostalgic goon and love the Seal Brown. Maybe I'm not looking at things correctly, and I should realize the white uni's aren't safe and may be gone next year, too. 




 True story. We have 2 Joe Ha(y)dens on the Browns. They are also arguably our 2 best players. Coincidence? Yes. 




 I am going to get one more jersey before we change to the new style. I already have a Seal Brown '40' that was given to me with "Hillis" scraped off and my name stenciled on as a gift (First Jersey) I then bought a Seal Brown Cribbs '16' and a Seal Brown Haden '23'. I pretty much know that I want a Thomas '73'. The question is, do I want to go Seal Brown again, or do I go with my first White Jersey? 

I want the Seal Brown because I worry we wont have them next year, and I think I will still be able to get a white jersey next year. But I dont have a white jersey, yet, and I think Thomas might be really sick in White. 

Suggestions? 




 I have heard from a buddy in Nebraska that he wasn't dirty at all in college and in fact had a large and positive following online. He surmised that there might be someone in the Lions staff that has coached him to play dirty. I don't follow middle America CFB, or the Lions, so I don't know. Just some insight. [Also, not everyone can be as cool as Spencer Lanning](http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/browns_impact/photo/16359131-mmmain.jpg)  and that's something we just have to learn to live with. 




 This. 




 I live in Seattle and another win would mean another [huge ass, polite, party](http://youtu.be/Qo4z77OvznU) 




 I am the most badass epic legendary neighbor. Here is my story:

I moved into the most beautiful neighborhood near Atlanta, GA. Historic Druid Hills across from Emory University. My house was perfect in so many ways. I had my own room with attached smoking porch, a gourmet kitchen, roommates that I loved, music, fun, parties, pets. It was perfect. Until 10pm every night. I lived next door to this horrible old woman and her 90 year old mother. We shared a driveway that split at the end into each of our yards. Once noise ordinance set in, the police calls would begin. It was a never ending, revolving door of police visit after police visit.

Listening to classical music and cooking a late dinner? Police. 

Laughing at a game of Apples to Apples and watching Craig Ferguson? Police. 

But the night that changed me was the night I came home from working 3 jobs at 11pm. I was, in this order, a Lumberjack, Mexican Restaurant Waiter, Gormet Pizza Chef for Everybody's Pizza  and my day started at 6am.

All I wanted was a milk shake. Sometimes all of life's problems can be solved, at least in the moment, with a milkshake. All of the sudden I hear the 3 hard knocks of an irate police officer. I answer the door holding the blender.

"Hello, Officer. What is it this time?

He points to my blender. 

"Your blender"

I must have looked at him in a really messed up way, because he gave me this 'Don't shoot the messanger' look with his hands up, and said

"Look. Just be quiet over here. I sat outside and you aren't doing anything technically wrong, but she is going to call us every time she hears you and we are 
going to have to respond"

So, being at the end of my rope, I asked a question. 

"What time does ordinance lift?"

"5am" he replied, and turned on his heel to leave. I nodded, closed the door, hand stirred the rest of my milk shake, went to bed, and set my alarm.

5am came slower than Christmas. Once my alarm went off I sat up, combed my hair, brushed my teeth, got dressed, and removed my trumpet from its case. 

*it should be mentioned here that OP played one quarter of a year of trumpet in 5th grade.*

I made my way out to where the split in our driveways began. Standing just on my side of the property, I faced her house, and began the most discordant, obnoxious, sonically discombobulating, racket I could muster. After a solid 2 minutes, the meanest, morning faced, most mad, vile, fist clenched, woman you have ever seen comes charging out of her house at me. I can tell that she has probably just gotten off the phone with the police, and has been informed that noise ordinance lifts at 5am

"STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT!!!! YOU STOP THAT RIGHT NOW"

At this point she is stomping and spitting and her hair is starting to unspring from her head, and I put my trumpet politely in her face and blow it as hard as I can while attempting to play as close to a 26/33 cadance as I can get. She runs back into the house and a few minutes later comes back outside. I like to imagine she called the police again to tell them what happened and they  politely told her to flake off, hung up the phone and laughed to each other about the field this lady was reaping from her actions.

Once again she beelines over to me and tries to take my trumpet. I pull it away and jut my face towards hers.

"If you touch my trumpet I'll have you arrested. You want to own the night. I own the fucking day"

And for a solid week my trumpets calls could be heard all the way to the CDC.
*EDIT Spelling* 




 I live in Washington. It's true. You have to get money from the ATM for the dispensaries.  




 I did not expect such an amazing reaction to these!  Maybe I'll share my Batman comic I wrote. Not doing me any good since I can't get anyone in DC to look at it. At least someone would read it. Lol!  




 The validity of this image aside, you should always remember that an information age is also a disinformation age. If this image were real, the image of the jet and missile could have just as easily been pulled from this picture, placed on a dummy site,  and then the SEO of the image optimized for search engines, program a bot to search and click the imagery hundreds of times to drive up the search relevancy,  and now it looks fake. Lotta work,  but if you are covering up a world wide incident... *shrug*  There are definitely people online paid to spread misinformation. They are most likely also on /r/Conspiracy. *EDIT: Spelling* 




 Who's your boyfriend?  




 All I put on my list about survival gear was that I hike. This was what they extrapolated from that. I'm gonna throw em in my pack and hope I never need them, and then when they go out of date, use them as snare/dead fall bait. 




 I'm kinda with you.  




 6 days of rations in those packs, together. 




 Yup. 




 Yis.  




 When it might as well be a rock that he's kicking. 




 I agreed with this whole heartedly.  




 Wokka wokka! 




 I live on the Pacific Crescent Trail, and these are gonna be great.  














 Here's to a new year and a continued upward trend for the Browns and this Sub! 




 *Hides his Team Shaw shirt behind his back* Yes. Me too. 




 My side of this is more about a particular way that person expresses their side. See, I'd love for the sub to have less all caps screaming posts about Manziel not getting a fair rub, (over and over by the same person) and if they are done, I will be too. 




 /u/740Buckeye is too enamored with ManChild to give a real answer to this. Hoyer is worth money, and someone is going to pay him. #JayCutlerClevelandSuperBowl2015 




 I love the class, you know? He gives the middle finger to the camera, but just one, and he leaves his hand loose. It shows he isn't uptight, you know? I'm so excited that he represents our team. Class. Act. 




 I think you mean the top 3 teams that need a QB have the 1st, 2nd, 12th, and 19th pick. 




 Everyone is behind Manziel, giving him the D. 




 LOUD NOISES!  




 Biggest flop in the NFL is Manziel. 




 We are in desperate need of a quarterback. 




 Never got banned, sunshine. 




 Your tears make me happy. 




 I got you some clown shoes to wear. 




 Shurmer or Mangini, eh? Go Raiders. *Edit: Sarcasm font*
 




 It's from his rookie year, and I think it looks pretty beastly too. 




 I think that this article nails it on the head. This front office/coaching staff is amazing. The movement to ManChild was perfect in its timing. We had enough time to see what he could do. Even after that shutout, the choice to play him again was the right decision. Connor Shaw was the correct decision for the Ravens. I'm more than satisfied with our infrastructure and the choices they have made. I trust, for the first time in modern history, that they will field the best decisions available to them. 




 Gratzi. 




 Are hazel eyes really an evolutionary mystery? Follow up in case the answer is yes: What is your theory?
