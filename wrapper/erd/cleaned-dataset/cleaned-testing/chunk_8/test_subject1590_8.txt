 Fair enough. Agreed. 




 Maybe you are right, but I'd argue that there are very few names that get remembered over time (this is not to say Villa is bad).

Just consider Spain alone, in the past 10 years or so, I'd say Xavi, Iniesta, Casillas, Raul are bigger names than him (not comparing skills here, just saying these names are more well-known), and probably Puyol, Ramos are at his level. There you've got 7 or 8 names already for that decade, so in 50 years basically there would be 40 or so players of, roughly speaking, his level or better. I doubt anyone could remember 40 names from one country (even if it's your country) unless if something special happened that made you remember him.

And plus, people tend to remember more recent players and forget old ones. How many players from the 1960s can you name? 




 What's his name, by the way? 




 Before you ask this question, you will need to define what legend is. If we are taking about legend as in someone who is, at some point, one of the best players for a top country/club, then I think he is. But if we are talking about legend as one one who could be remembered/recognized 30 or 50 years later (e.g. Maradona, Zidane etc), then I think no. 




 It's just for fun, don't take it too serious.

And, they are actually pretty good for US   Canada. 




 I am glad that you say your are here to learn than to get higher marks. As a TA myself, I am really glad to hear students say so, and personally get motivated by that (to teach better). But unfortunately, this is life and you must realize that the University, in general, don't care very much about undergrads. 









 What I mean by easier is also not to say the learning is easier. But generally speaking, summer instructor will tend to keep marks slightly higher, for various internal reasons. 




 When you have time, go to a library you like that mostly contain books not from your subject. Spend some time there and read random books. This is both entertaining and fruitful, because too many people these days only know their subject and nothing more. 




 It's true that that PhD student are usually bad, but not always.

I am a PhD student myself and I get rated highly by my students always. Students often secretly tell me that I am even better than their instructor. So, don't assume that every PhD student is bad :) 




 Summer instructors are usually bad, but easier. 









 Anyone here cheering for Williams? 



















 What I meant to say is that Wired is a decent source for tech news, so I wouldn't say what they are publishing are rumors just because I have not heard about it myself. 









 I don't know, but do they have to show it to the public in order for this statement to be true? 




 Oh, that's a surprise. I always thought the chess players are supported like the Olympic athletes. Guess that's not the case. 









 Well said.

I think as a Chinese player playing at his level, the state will have an important say on your career, perhaps even more than you and your family. The state may make certain decisions and "recommend" those to you. So yeah, not saying that he will necessarily do well, but he definitely won't be like Josh Waitzikin, who just suddenly ditched chess. 




 I like this one! Will add it in now. 




 Maybe this has some truth to it. Tradition chess countries like Russian and Ukraine seem like talent-lacking at the moment, so maybe yeah, the Chinese and Indians may have a chance (India has a really talented player as well I think, forgot the name). 




 Agree. I think traditional tech companies are all retreating back into their core businesses. IBM is the other example.

 I am reading about contango and backwardation. Essential, if I am understanding correctly, contango is when t futures price (or forward price) of a commodity is higher than the expected price today. So basically, does that mean if the price of some commodity stays constant, the price of their futures will still drop because of contango?

How does this affect non-commodity futures such as VIX futures? Do they suffer from contango as well? If so, does that mean the price of VIX futures will drop even if the VIX index remains constant for a period of time?

And finally, what futures are examples of backwardation?  









 It's hard to compare players in different era, simply because the overall playing strength improve over time. 




 Do you think Wei Yi will become the World Champion? To be honest, I think he will definitely be a strong contender for the title, but not so sure if he will be good enough to defeat Magnus. 














 Where did you see this? It's likely a rumor. Marotta said Juve has completed all of the summer transfers. And please, I don't think we can offer an 18 year old for 20 mil. 









 Yeah, some people know it I guess. But I just learned it today and for the last like 10 years I used Paint. 









 It is interesting that you bring up the metaphorical aspect, and you could totally be right. It would be interesting to see if this season explores the supernatural aspect, just like the first seasons. 




 I looked at his CV too, and that's what I thought as well. But you know, I guess it's hard for people from non-English universities to publish in top journals, so maybe he is a bright guy but doesn't have lots of stellar publications. I think he has some books that are well known. 




 You are right, I think it would just be out of shock value to keep people watching. 









 Good game, congrats! Your opponent played a weird game. 














 Good point! I totally agree. 




 did you watch the episode? 









 Zaza will prove to be worth the value, I think. 














 Reading this from Wikipedia:
Bloomberg said that Varoufakis was a "brilliant economist"

Galbraith, referring to Varoufakis's expertise in game theory, has said that he knows as much about this subject "as anyone on the planet"

So, does he have really good publications? 




 The toilet is broken, that's probably the only reason why I would not flush. 




 I would say your best blitz rating on chess.com (I am guess mos people play blitz) would be roughly 100 points higher than your FIDE rating and maybe 0-50 pts higher than your USCF. 




 Soon Wei Yi will be a challenger to Magnus Carlsen. 




 I think scientists have also genetically engineered some other animals to glow. Remembered reading about this before. 




 This is a really interesting concept, kinda like massdrop. 




 I know that is the case, but why is it, for example, that Argentina and Brazil have good men's team? Do they have more talented men than women? 




 For example, USA has the best women's soccer team, but their men's team is nowhere near the top. Countries like Canada, China, North Korea, Japan also have far better women's teams than men's teams. 














 Sorry for that. Perhaps try again? It worked fine for a lot of people, I think. 



















 Varrock is my pick. 









 You spelled Buffon's name wrong. Should be Gigi Buffon not Gini Buffon.
