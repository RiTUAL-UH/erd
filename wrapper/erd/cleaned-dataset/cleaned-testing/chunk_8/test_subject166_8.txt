 On the surface, it is ridiculous.  Corporations are started by people and granted authority to exist by government. 




 Wow!  Do I wish I could draw like that! 




 I don't remember it being $1 ever.  It was about $10 in 1970. 




 Just beautiful! 




 2400 customers is unbelievable. 




 Is there a link here? 




 Remember when they quietly changed the rules of benefiting from inside knowlege on stocks? 




 Inspirational.  I wonder if it had as much to do with his coach.  I grew up here also and never felt that way. 




 If you do have her come, have her contact Nevada Partners who are located in the same building as the Culinary Training Academy and they will help her by  paying for the training. 




 Pelosi passed a ton of bills.  The Senate had 60 votes for only a few months.   









 Not now, but thanks.  Have a great night!
 




 About 9 hr drive from Vegas in northern Nevada, but the Black Rock Desert where they hold Burning Man each year, is incredible:

 About 9 hrs drive from Vegas in the Black Rock Desert, but the geyser looks incredible:  http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTSl0pgd1dYdtqoxZzobjQCtp6NLW-JEPyX4e_8qCifuOs4q4BZGC_Yris 




 It is worth seeing.  I laughed so hard it hurt.  I bought tickets during the presale too, but ended up being at 5 or 6 rows from the top. 




 Not necessarily related to polling, but President Reagan was not popular when he left office.  (I don't remember the numbers.)  Some republicans freaked out and funded a campaign to improve his image.  So, for years, there has been a well-funded effort to name places after him, write articles that made him look like a great president, etc. etc. 




 I like it. 




 I don't know.  Unions are able to turn people out to work in campaigns; they spend money and turn people out to walk precincts, make phone calls, GOTV.
 




 I want to be there right now. 




 It's so sad.  I hope it doesn't dry up and that we have a good El Nino year with lots of rain.  And good snow this winter in the Rockies. 




 Beautiful photo. 




 Dual goals.  Works. 




 That's what Brock said. 




 Just the hypocracy. 




 I love it! 




 Yep. 




 I wish they would join rather than fight us. 




 I couldn't get much from the article.  I would like to know more.  At the time, I heard that all the jobs that were supposed to be created in Mexico went to China instead. 




 Even worse are those SSI, SNAP and TANF recipients wail on on how much they hate assistance.  They deserve it, but no one else does. 




 One of my favorite books was Blinded by the Right by David Brock.  He was paid to help bring down Bill Clinton, but saw the light and started Media Matters.  He also outed Matt Drudge who is still the right-wing source for news. 




 We talk about sugar and fat, but I wonder what these antibiotics do to increase our fattening. 




 Conservatives hated the student protests of the 70's, and they blamed the professors for teaching liberal ideas.  They systematically worked (and there could be multiple ways to do this) to increase the costs of studies to restrict enrollment in schools and  to keep students and graduates so indebted that they would stop liberal arts studies and wouldn't have time to protest social injustices anymore.  They also worked to stop professors from getting tenure (where they could say what they believed without threat of losing their jobs) to adjunct professors who could not even support themselves any longer. 




 Beautiful job. 




 I think it will change, but I spoke with a company at a fair and it basically came down to that I would need a new roof, new windows and doors and new siding on my 55-yr old house before I could even consider solar.  LOL.  It would cost me the entire value of my house to prepare it for solar!  And I live in a neighborhood whose residents could benefit from solar. 




 Sorry, I should have posted this sooner.  c3connect.com was hiring 500 people this week. You were to apply online, then go to their open house at about 7830 Las Vegas Blvd. So. for interview.  40 hrs/week x 10/hr for customer service. Training starts 7/7 or 7/11.  Also paying $100 to each person giving a referral and $200 to that person if the new employee stays 6 months.  Not sure how many positions they actually filled this week, so you may still want to apply online.  Just made some corrections to this. Also, they are still having open interviews next week Monday - Thursdays also. 




 I agree.  I think that exposure and empathy is also valuable.  I would rather know people that TRY to do good than one those who didn't try or care.  Maybe it is possible that this gets translated into helping less fortunate at home when they return. 




 Also, we had a civil war over states rights (which was a really the right for states to decide if they could have slavery).  This war was fought and won, but they are still fighting for states rights.   




 It says alot that 90 percent of the republican party is white.  Source: "Dog Whistle Politics". 




 What else is new? 




 Especially in the bathroom! 




 There is a company that is hiring 500 people by Friday.  You need to apply online, then go prior to Friday for interview.  I have their location at my office but it is on the 6000 block of Las Vegas Blvd. So. Maybe you could call and get their address.  They are interviewing and hiring on the spot.  40 hrs x 12/hr.  At least it is getting back into the work force.  http://www.c3connect.com/ 




 Check history.  Republicans may reduce taxes, but create huge deficits that Democrats  have to clean up.  They usually spend great amounts on the military. 




 This is not a little kid - but I just learned a few years ago that pickles were pickled cucumers.  Never knew that... Duh. 




 A lot of hotels will hire felons IF they are upfront about it in the application.  We had a list at work and I updated it once just by making phone calls.  Have him call HR departments before he applies. 




 Looks like fun!
 




 The south already lost one civil war. 




 I'm curious if you are looking for work, and what kind? 




 Dr. Zhivago is my favorite movie.  The expansive scenes, beautiful music.  I never read the book or knew of the history behind it.  Thanks for the post. 




 It has been years since I read the book.  I loved the book until the end.  I didn't think the book led to the same conclusions as the author. 




 What an idiot. 




 Naked Gun. 




 These are the types of things that turn me off towards conservatives. 




 I'd have to do a search, but I remember reading someone was arrested for using a two dollar bill. I used to see them occasionally but bit recently. I'd love to have one! 




 $$$$ 









 Just looked at the heading, but this is sick. 




 I remember an article that corporations were all getting their share, although the article specifically mentioned Toys R Us. 




 It's also the biggest contributor to the Democratic party.  Kill unions, Democrats cannot compete for big donors.  They have some, but not nearly enough for parity.  I really believe this is the main reason they are under attack. 




 You are right. It's just that we are viciously attacked when we try to make this distinction. 




 Their form of libertarianism is to tell others how to be. All you have to do is to look at the anti-women, anti-gay legislation being enacted in red states. They are religious fanatics. I don't care that they practice their religion, but don't try to put it on everyone else either. 




 Why do conservatives consistently support the one percent who are as a whole as corrupt as you can get? 




 Yes, the most of the rich want everyone else to work for pennies. 




 I'm so tired of it too, and then I think of these crazies trying to tell ME how to be.  I don't mind if they live their own lifes the way they want; just don't prevent me from living my life too.   




 Quit my job and take a much needed vacation to recover!  Who knows after that - some type of philanthropy. 




 There is no left wing radio.  I hate these equivalencies that just don't exist.  The left wing in America is centrist, not radical at all. 




 I want to know also. 




 Who was buying bonds when they offered 0 yield? 




 Let them eat cake! 




 I don't understand how they can remain in the same party.  Libertarians are the exact opposite of the religious right. 




 I appreciated your story.  We are not all perfect and to be successsful in reaching your goals is great.  Any kind of motivation helps. 




 Think it might be from Fukushima? 




 We could use some shaping of behavior - in terms of global warming - which may end up costing us a lot more in the long run rather than short term gains. 




 I'm not so sure. The PBS series Nature just had a show on crows who are exceptionally intelligent. They said they had a particularly large brain per body size. They mentioned other animals or mammals and said it was the ratio of brain to body size that determined intelligence. They probably meant as a species not an individual however. 




 I think you can get the parts at Home Depot or Lowe's, or google for other parts. 




 The original looked so much cooler though, but I heard that was the reason when they changed it. 




 I'm interested. Not sure how so keep me informed. 




 conspicuous consumption. 









 I hate to see this comparison.  There really is no left in this country.  Our left is center and it goes right from there. 




 The RJ had an article a while back giving 50-50 odds that it will dry up by 2021.  I've seen some photos of the lake near Sacramento that is dry, and Lake Shasta is also dropping fast.  One hope is that we have a good El Nino this year.

 Not sure it was bad for me, but I wish now that I did summer sschool and graduated a year early. That would have been cool. 




 And he did this while still a candidate.  Wasn't even president then. 




 It gets so old. 




 Thanks! 




 So true.  I've seen that so many times. 




 I watch jobs as they come out.  I have seen a bartender apprenticeship job advertised in the past week - not sure if it was through MGM properties or Stations, but keep trying.  You usually have to start as a bar back.  There is a bartender's union also.  Not sure if they are accepting new members, but it might be worth a call to check them out or to see what they recommend.  This is not a job, but the best I can think of right now. 









 How did the big tiles work out?   I've been looking at shower tiles and my husband wants me to get the 4x4 tiles.  By the way, it looks great.  You did a good job! 




 I read about the group out of Washington DC (Mt Pleasant) that started a buyers coop and with tax rebates, were able to get the price down to 1500 per house. I live in LV too. Don't think there are any tax rebates available today, but I'm sure we could do better.  We ought to brainstorm.  I couldn't find the original article but saw a newsletter that said it should cost from 5000 - 7000 now per house. 




 Basically, that's what FDR did. 




 People don't remember Daniel Ellsberg from the 70's. 




 Beautiful.  I love them!  I only wish I had enough to do one book.  I am recommending them to a friend who has traveled their entire life.  




 http://www.meetup.com/synshop/ 









 That's the other problem.  The Chrisitan right believes in faith, not facts. 




 It is getting tough.  We had a doctor tell my husband he needed surgery when he needed a dentist.  I've had dentists tell me a group of my teeth needed to be taken out - and years later, I still have the teeth.  There is a book called "Trust me - We're Experts" about how lawyers bring in experts for both sides who contradict each other - for a fee.  There is always someone in there for the cash.   I try to look for friends or knowledgable people who are not looking for gain for guidance. 




 Is it a contest? 




 Travel outside of the country before I was married. I also wish had been bolder in my dreams, worked harder to achieve them. 




 Me too.  I'd walk in a minute. 




 Doesn't defy physics, but I love them.  




 Doc Martin, MI5. 









 Looks great. 




 What else is new? 




 Immediately. 




 Get names and years on the photos.  Ask about their parents and relatives.   I have these photos and don't know who is who. 




 I appreciate both of your comments.  I think about this ALL of the time, and how we can bring them around.  We are not dealing with a whole group of issues that can affect our lives.  And I can't even talk with my conservative friends or family about issues - they will not even debate. I think this is the issue main issue now of our time. 




 Some of these right-wing idiots will do anything to screw us.  This was an article I saved last year regarding a guy from Chicago:
http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/17917-bombshell-plutocrats-brazenly-collude-to-hurt-state-economies-and-screw-working-people 




 I think you did a great job!
 




 So many people here are cynical.  I would have cried too. 




 No other president cared as much for the working man either. 




 I know people living then who thought he was a God. 




 Remember the song with the lyrics "joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea".  Fishes?  Really? 









 Where is it? 




 I can relate. 




 Makes me dizzy.
 




 Thank you.  Great post. 














 I'm impressed. 




 Heis a good guy. 




 They tried to cut food stamps, medicare, and stop the affordable care act, but those darn democrats got in the way. 




 I'm curious what school she graduated from, like Michelle Bachman. 




 Good post. 




 He doesn't say crazy things like Ann Coulter.  I hate to see this false equivalency. 




 I thought this was a great article. I'm very interested in how we can bridge this divide and solve some of the problems that may cause our ultimate demise if ignored. 




 I listened to SCOTUS arguments on C-SPAN on another case and heard Scalia make an argument straight from Fox news that was totally inaccurate (the health care law). I could not believe what I was hearing! At least be factual! 




 You have Reagan saying that Government is the problem, and then it became one.    




 I worked as a job developer in the 80's in a low-income community.  I would ask clients to choose 1) more income or 2) closer proximitiy.  Most clients would ask for proximity because it was so difficult to get to jobs even with a bus service.  I see it still today. 




 She ought to get 100% subsidy.   




 I wouldn't want to wash it off -ever!  




 Very nice. 




 It was as fun as it looked. 




 Hmmmm. 




 No, I'm not bitching about the bailout.  I just would like another one for Detroit. 




 You're right.  I posted to the wrong comment!  Duh. 




 96% of Romney's vote was white, so I guess that leaves 4% of everyone else. 




 If you believe in fiscal sanity, vote Democratic!  All you have to to is look at spending under Reagan, Clinton, Bush and Obama, then tell me who is fiscally more sound. 




 I'll repeat myself.  Don't rewrite history.  All those Democrats became Republicans after the Civil Rights Act passed under Johnson.   




 Don't rewrite history.  Once the Civil Rights Act was passed, all the Dixiecrats became Republicans. 




 I wish all the people without medicaid would register and vote for democrats.  That would get some attention. 




 While my guitar gently weeps.
