 You could try /r/HeavySeas. For ships, there's /r/WarshipPorn 




 This was taken approx 210 NM off of the coast of Alaska in the Bearing Sea during one of the summer storms. 









 How closely does NOAA and NMFS work with the US Coast Guard with regards to releasing rehabilitated turtles and anything else that might threaten turtles? 




 AutoMod has been revamped and should be able to do this. 




 Yep! 




 Not to be confused with the rotten Desert Bluffs! 




 [](/suspicioustwi) Are you one of the trees in that forest? 




 TREES, THEY ARE US 




 Imagine that :P 




 Most of his stuff is royalty free, but I know of a song being posted to here later today that if you wish to use it for commercial purposes, it's like $5 to purchase the song. 




 After that tour, I spent the rest of my career trying to get back underway 




 Yep! 




 I shall look into that!

Thank you :) 




 Where would you recommend someone ,who has had their love of space rekindled, start to learn more about space and the amazing wonders that are waiting out there? 









 I am both mesmerized and terrified at the same time 




 Here's the best way to determine if you're an AB.

Do you identify as an AB?

Survey says:

I consider me not being an AB just a DL.

I think if anything you're a DL who's interested in the AB side of things. But that's just my two cents.  




 I always hated wearing Trops (Tropical Blue Long) and standing at Attention/Parade Rest like a damned ornament. Especially when we would pull in. 




 I don't think the bear would do so well inside of the vibe :P 




 I am strangely turned on by it but still find it a bit odd to be honest. Is it for both male and female? 




 I appreciate the thought! Mostly, I like to post pics from the Coast Guard :) 




 I've been hanging out on /r/schweiz and /r/WarshipPorn lately.  




 Mostly the ones in the sidebar. /r/abdlstories, /r/DudesInDiapers, /r/GirlsInDiapers, sometimes, /r/babyfurs and /r/littlespace. 




 It does work I will give it that. But it's also becoming a place where I don't really want to waste an hour of my life as things get all backstaby. 




 While difficult at first, it does get easier and you'll find you start to relate with bits and pieces. You'll never truly identify with one person as everyone's experiences are slightly different, but you'll start to see themes that are present in your own life.  




 They are helpful! Stay strong and remember, one day at a time. 




 Hi. My name is /u/test_subject1730 and I'm an alcoholic. I've been in Alcoholic Anonymous  for damn near 3 years now. The program is helpful but still full of shit at the same time. I've never been in a bigger real life circlejerk before, but it has helped me stay sober. Everyday I struggle with not drinking and I know that there are people I can call if it gets bad that have been there and can talk me down from the ledge, as it were. People talk about addiction to numerous drugs, but a lot of people forget the powerful effects that alcohol has and that it too is just as powerful of a demon as many illicit substances.  




 The map really helps a lot! It was amusing to see the collective blinding of /r/WarshipPorn with the first graphic. Fantastic work though! 




 It's fantastic to see you post this here! :D

Amazing work as always!
