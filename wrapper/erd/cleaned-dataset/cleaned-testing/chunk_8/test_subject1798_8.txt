 Not only that, this is self-reported and relies on memory of something that happened 10, 20 or more years ago.

Can we say "meaningless?" 




 What if I say:  "If you elect me sheriff, I promise to end all speed traps." How do you think that would go over, and how do you think drivers would respond? 




 Wait, wut? Platonic spooning is a thing? 




 If you knew how an election primary works then you'll understand why Congress doesn't give a fuck what "most Americans" want. They only care about the special interests that can mobilize enough votes (and it really doesn't take many votes or much effort) to defeat them in a primary. 




 I just don't think they were gullible. Sure, there are a few idiots in Congress but the vast majority are not dumb. They are very good at calculating but this was one time where their calculations were wrong. I believe many of them cast a Yes vote to authorize military force, not because they actually believed Iraq was any kind of imminent threat, but because they felt it was going to be a cakewalk and they didn't want to be on the wrong side of that vote. I count Hilary Clinton among that group. Indeed the invasion *was* a cakewalk. They just didn't count on the major fuckupery that happened under Paul Bremer, Douglas Feith, Paul Wolfowitz, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney (dismantling the Iraq Army, disenfranchising Baathists, insufficient security manpower--none of that is the fault of Congress).

Again, that's not leadership. A leader would do what they really believed was right, not what they calculated to be politically expedient. I don't see any indication whatsoever that she is any different now than she was then. With her in the White House, it would still be more about political expediency than philosophical, moral and ethical structure.

I may still vote for her, but I'll be holding my nose while doing it. 




 I disagree. Scott Ritter, who was an UNSCOM weapons inspector in Iraq, was travelling throughout the country and all over the news prior to the Iraq invasion telling people that Iraq had no WMDs and no capability to make them. Congress knew (or should have known) that none of the 9/11 hijackers had any relationship to Iraq. The yellowcake story and subsequent attempts to link Iraq to 9/11 by the administration had already been discredited (look up Joseph Wilson and Valerie Plame).

If somebody voted in favor of authorizing military force against Iraq in spite of all of this, then it's clear evidence of a failure of leadership. 




 I also don't see much difference between my local Walmart and Whole Foods fruits and vegetables except the price. Whole Foods has better prepared foods, breads and bulk foods section (grains, nuts, dried fruits, etc). 




 God was probably proud of his son's accomplishments, especially when he treated lepers, the blind, the sick and the poor, all for free. 




 85% vs. 95% = 15% vs 5%. I think that's awful but maybe it's a glass half empty or full kind of thing. The glaring point about your comment is this:  Of the 85% who are insured the vast majority is employer-tied. Why the hell is it the responsibility of the employer to buy/subsidize health insurance for their employees? That's fucked up. If you were to design a health insurance system, no mentally stable person would ever say this was a good thing to do. 




 Lost in all of your approving comments is the sad fact that something like this has to be done in America. No other handicapped citizen in any other first world country has to worry about health care. 




 You break, you buy. Ask Murica. 




 Of course. Any middle eastern studies professor could have told you that, and many tried to tell Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld.

ISIS is directly descended from the Iraq war. 




 Netanyahu wants to *increase* sanctions. Because that worked so well with North Korea?

Netanyahu's proposals would lead directly to military action. The purpose of diplomatic talks is, to put it bluntly, to get a diplomatic solution. The 7-Nation talks produced a solution that pushes the nuclear armament horizon from 2 months to 12 months, and includes constant monitoring and complete access. 

The goal of the diplomatic solution is to avoid the military warfare which actually *does* threaten Israel's survival. 




 Even though steak is great, it's OK to just want a hot dog every now and then.

 Most of the atmospheric science community believes that it's already too late. 




 Whenever an innocent person is freed, the cops, prosecutors, judge and jurors should be named and pictures of them made public. 




 First, it really is a great map. Many commenters say that they wish they could do this. 

No you don't.

A perfectly working human brain forgets things. This is by design. The human brain is really good at separating the wheat from the chaff, identifying and paying attention to what is important to survival and reproduction. When your brain treats every bit of information the same and remembers it all, it's a curse not a blessing. 




 That's great! 









 Good guy, that Kubrick. 




 We are doomed as a species because we have turned evolution upside down. The most unsuccessful individuals are breeding at a much higher rate than successful individuals. 




 I'm asian, and I always find the "honor" and "heroism" argument of Japanese suicidal fighting to be specious. It's not heroism. It's actually a different form of cowardice. It's the inability to stand up to a culture that is threatening public shame and humiliation to your family if you don't die for your leader. 




 So did you think was he the breaking   entering type before all this? 




 When I started my business I signed a lease agreement for an office, and agreements for phone lines and internet. All of those agreements have early termination penalty clauses, as will the renewals. I was a dumbass. 














 I haven't clicked either. I'm just not man enough for that shit. 




 It has happened to me. A piece of firewood fell out of a pickup truck coming towards me on a 2 lane highway, bounced once on the road then hit my car. Smashed the windshield but fortunately it did not go through. My wife was in the car with me. We pulled over, looked at each other, said "Wow, holy shit." Then I turned around and chased down the driver and got their insurance info. The lady said "sorry" but wasn't all that upset about it. 




 Think about what you're selling. People buy solutions to problems. 

1. Identify the problem.
2. Come up with a sales pitch that presents you as a solution.
3. There are other solutions out there competing for the same customer. Make your solution the prized one. 




 Really? Seemed fine with Chrome 41.0.2272.104 on a MBP Core 2 Duo running Yosemite. 




 You will probably never get her approval because for her it's about exercising power and control. Her threat to embarrass you is an obvious clue that she is not rational. It's a war and she will threaten any nuclear option she has. Remember, she has had 22 years to learn your emotional weaknesses and she will exploit them.

Your choice is this:  Give in and reinforce her belief that she can control you through emotional torture, or withstand the onslaught, get battered, and emerge from this with her realizing that she no longer has that kind of power over you. That path will be very difficult but I believe you'll thank yourself in a year. 




 Sun. Lots of sun. Water twice a day. Don't pack the soil. 




 Beef is so cheap in the U.S. that pho ga is always just an afterthought. Sometimes I want something different but I have yet to be satisfied with any pho ga here. 




 I generally agree except that I think the Pho Ga is better in Vietnam. 




 You mean *hyperbolical*. Hyperbolic means to follow the curve of a hyperbola. A common mistake. 




 Oh, WITHOUT A DOUBT. I think by the end he realized it too. That's why he and Cheney barely acknowledge each other now. He knows Dick fucked Bush. 




 I'm sure there are things about him that you wish were better. Maybe better abs, pecs, ass, hair, a bigger dick.

A relationship goes through these stages. At first, you are completely blind and see nothing but perfection. Then you see an imperfection, then a few more. Couples that make it through this stage find ways to accept their partner's imperfections and that is exactly what defines a successful LTR. It's not easy to do but that's also why most relationships fall apart. 

I think it's healthy to get these things in the open but talk about the fact that nobody will be a perfect fit to their partner's ideal but as adults, can you find acceptance with each other's perceived shortcomings. 




 Sure, OKC is used widely and without much incident. The fear is, of course, irrational but it exists. I read the study a couple of weeks ago, probably on reddit. I'll look for it.... 




 Recent study came out that most women on OKC fear that their first date will end up with them as different body parts in a dumpster. So I think this is a reason why a lot of women prefer FWBs over one night stands. 




 Dear India,

Stop trying to scam me with fake virus cleanups and I'll think about helping you.

 Regardless of advisors, the President still makes the final decision.  




 Interestingly, some quite rational people believe that there is a segment of religious conservatives--mostly Baptists--who *want* war in the middle east because it will bring on the second coming of Christ. They will support any military endeavor in that region. 




 Vietnam here. Don't know what that is but it's not pho. With pho, the broth is added to a bowl of dry ingredients. It is never cooked in a pot. Certainly we don't add chopped scallions and bean sprouts to the cooking pot.

I'm not sure it's Vietnam (not a single cone hat to be found in the photo). *If* this is even Vietnam, it may be a soup like *canh chua* which is a sour soup. 




 This is the best response and should be upvoted more. 




 In America, the Republican party tries to have you believe that Brits hate the NHS and want it to be more like the American system. 




 It's probably about half the water. Using the traditional method I would use about 4-6 cups of water (1-1.5 L if you're not Murcan) for a single serving of 3 oz pasta. It gets to boiling really fast, a few minutes. This dish was 15 minutes to fork-ready.  




 Faster, less energy, less water.

 What, you haven't seen his previous internationals? 




 Maybe at the MLS level but his last couple of internationals were very shaky. 




 Hahaha, is your petty little ego so fragile that a few up votes makes your day? How incredibly pathetic. "Good design is timeless?" Holy shit, are you in high school? Here's a secret that you'll learn when you actually get out in the real world:  You don't know if your design is "good" or "timeless." Nothing that is timeless was ever designed with that in mind because history judges that, dumbass. 

Here's the thing: You did not discuss Bebas Neue. You never even attempted to do so. You belched meaningless tripe in a sophomoric effort to be an anti-populist "cool kid." A reference to Emojis? Are you fucking serious? Guess what? Emojis have been around longer than you, my precious little budding teenage artist, and they will outlive any crap you manage to dump on humanity. Maybe that means they're "timeless" and therefore "good design."

If you can't tell the fucking difference between Bebas Neue and Helvetica, you have a long fucking way to go before your opinion is worth the toilet paper you use to wipe it off your ass. Go study like a good little student and maybe someday somebody will give a shit. 




 Ah, thanks for the info. The law was a Republican law (sponsored by Charles Grassley) that was meant to force Democrats into using the ACA exchange. Can we chalk this up to "unintended consequences?" 









 Actually, the problem is with you. I asked a question to get people's opinions. If you didn't have an opinion, just stfu. Instead, you assumed that I wouldn't use a font if I believed it was overexposed. You would be wrong. Assumptions make asses, and you proved the adage again.

You should care because you should know design styles and trends. This happens all over the creative world, whether it's visual arts, fashion or music. That doesn't mean you should limit yourself to only what is hot at the moment. Absolutely not. But you should keep up with what's going on in the world so you can stay relevant. 




 Is it the new Lobster? I have the feeling that it has passed its peak of usefulness. 




 Try fried shallots. You can get them from an asian grocery store for a few bucks a bagful, the equivalent of probably a few dozen shallots. I sprinkle them on salads and soups, add them to burgers (my secret burger ingredient). 




 I agree. I think red onion is still too sharp. Vidalias in salad is my preference. 




 Debone and skin them, marinate in olive oil, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper for 30 minutes. Skewer, grill, squeeze some lemon over it and enjoy with Beaujolais. 




 I first learned of the cold pan method of cooking pasta from Chow.com ([link](http://www.chow.com/videos/show/chow-tips/94799/how-to-quickly-cook-pasta-in-a-frying-pan)). My first time making it, I was worried that the small amount of water would cause the pasta to stick together so I chose whole wheat pasta because it has less starch. That pasta didn't stick so tonight I tried it again, this time with regular pasta. For the recipe I decided to keep it simple--butter, sea salt and parmigiana--and to reuse leftover supermarket rotisserie chicken from last night's dinner.

I measured out 3 oz. pasta, put it in my 8" skillet and added enough water to cover plus extra to account for absorption and vapor loss, around 2 cups, maybe a little more. I put the cold pan on the flame and it got to boiling within a couple of minutes. This time I started a timer when I reached boiling. Here's a [photo](http://i.imgur.com/ytqwcyV.jpg) of the pasta in the pan. While the pasta was cooking I shredded the chicken and minced some basil.

The box called for 10 minute al-dente. I tasted the pasta at about 8.5 minutes and it was almost there. I took it off the heat, drained and reserved the pasta water and added the butter and chicken ([photo](http://i.imgur.com/vOijXXf.jpg)).

I tossed everything together. The residual heat of the pan was enough to melt the butter and warm the cold chicken. I added back a little pasta water to keep everything moist. I seasoned with sea salt, black pepper, and added shredded parmigiana and the basil.

Here's a [photo](http://i.imgur.com/ayPjFlJ.jpg) of the finished dish. Elapsed time, about 15 minutes. It was delicious!

Notes:

* Part way through cooking there was no longer enough water to fully cover the pasta. I just stirred the pasta a couple of times a minute and I really didn't notice any effects from that. Next time I'll start with a little more water.

* Despite the very small amount of water used, the pasta did not stick together.

 




 This is kind of related. One of my rules is to try to find somebody who impresses me in some way. I've dated both--women who do and women who don't impress me--and it's a lot more fun with the ones who do. I accept it and embrace it as a part of my relationship and I make sure I let them know when they do or say something that is truly awesome. 









 That's not difficult to conceptualize because the milk is (presumably) sitting in the refrigerator while the tea is cooling.

What happens when you take the milk out at the beginning of the experiment and leave it out so that it is warming up while the tea is cooling down? 




 No, it just means American voters are dumbasses, but we already knew that. 




 There's usually a reason nobody goes to a kids birthday party. Probably because nobody likes the ki or the parents.

 Only a couple of things, stir fry and steaks. 




 Why hasn't doner kebab caught on in the U.S.? Why? 




 Great ideas. I can see how you can do stock and cream based sauces pretty easily right in the pan.  




 Is it possible to make your own sugar free syrups, using Splenda for example? 




 Others have given great advice and recipes. I'll just tell you my story. The first dish I attempted for my wife as a noob cook was blackened salmon out of a recipe book given to us as a wedding present. Disastrous, as in smoke-alarms-going-off disastrous. She still loved me and appreciated it. Fortunately, I got better. 




 I start with oil in a cold pan and pre-heat it gently (medium). This evens out the heat and minimizes hot spots. I then turn it up to cooking temperature and add my ingredients when the oil starts to shimmy. 




 I agree with this. Stainless is never 100% non-stick and that's not a bad thing. You need both types of pans because there are are times when you want it to stick. When you are cooking meats and are creating a fond for a sauce or extra flavor, use stainless. If you are cooking something delicate like fish or eggs, use non-stick. 




 Honestly, I didn't time it since I knew I was going to be unsure with this method. I just went by feel. After I started cooking with the sauce I just checked it with a bite every minute. The whole process was really fast, 15 minutes or so to being fork-ready. This is just a guess but if you were to start a timer when the water started boiling, you wouldn't be too far off. 




 I sure did!  




 I second the shrimp stock, or even chicken stock. In Thai and Vietnamese cooking we strive for the 4 flavors:  Sweet, salty, spicy and brightness (acid). Add a little sugar, start with 1 tsp. You just want only a hint of sweetness. It is a good counterpoint to saltiness and spiciness.
