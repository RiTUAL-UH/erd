 bad idea - no respect for your readers! Who wanted your changes?
A lots of folks wanted pure tech - RESTORE IT!!!! 




 Look really poor in this days. 
Cheaper and better option arudino clon form China - 2.80 and much more fan. 




 Whole idea behind homeopathy sounds really stupid but my experience and my wife's telling that it could help. And I believe more my experience then  top Aussie Uni research centers. I can take stuff from jungle medicine men but only one condition - got to work properly - doesn't matter reason or theory or ideology. 
One big advantage, it is so diluted that couldn't poison you - many thing from chemist shop really can. 




 Don't be such  puristic - this is about all old world business  




 Send your MEP email what you thinking about it!! 












































 If you will waiting for last minute to cancel your subscription you'll be definitely charged for the first month.
I enrolled and when I tried to cancel udacity several times (!!!) ask me to change my password to make sure it's really me - and all this time curse was on the list. So, if you want to cancel make sure you have half an hour to end of the trial.

 This is what I thought. But I couldn't find the link to view that stuff only enroll button where you must give bank account details and if you forget cancel enrollment before 1 week trial is done they will charge you for 1 month - $200.

Any one know a way to view nanodegree without giving bank details?  




 Udacity nanodegree - is it next way to pull money from people who forgot to cancel after they enrolled  and give bank card details? Or is any way to access nano-course materials without banks details? 
Isn't rip off to charge folks $200/month for MOOC? Estimated cost of one MOOC is 100k - 200k $. If will be 100k (as usually) and every one only forgot to cancel that will be profit circa 200M $ !!!???
That's better business than Apple, Google and Microsoft together. 




 I hope you right, I just looking for clear statement from MS.
