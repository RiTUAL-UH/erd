 What midfielder for less than $7.9 million is good for this week and maybe a couple of weeks ahead? 




 Tolls on all highways and major roads around Detroit. (People don't leave the city. If people wanted to avoid tolls, they go on other roads = more congestion = more business development). Cut Taxes on houses, businesses, and industry, which will attract people from outside the city. Add more police patrols to reduce crime. Build from the inner core and expand outwards. Build Public Transit Infrastructure, once there is density. Education, healthcare, parks, social services, etc later on.  




 The top card is the bottom card...

 Modern because we decided that we should send our factories over there and China decided to explore capitalism. Double Edge Sword? We want to "help developing countries", but doing so might hurt us. Then, we complain that we aren't growing as fast as them even though China has more people and it should be expected that they will have the largest GDP in the world. The real surprise is how the USA maintained its economic power for so long.  




 I agree. Over-specialization can bad. Look what happened to Detroit, when automation and outsourcing happened. If any major war. financial crisis, or whatever happens between the US and other countries, we wouldn't have the facilities to produce our own goods. We would be hit with a recession first, if that happens, since other countries would block imports to us. Prices will rise for all of us. In reality, nobody knows what the true cost of goods are, since there are so many external factors.

It is interesting though. Could the USA should export more goods than imports in goods to pay down our trillions of dollars of debt?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_deficits_hypothesis

"The twin deficits hypothesis, also called the double deficit hypothesis or twin deficits anomaly, is a macroeconomic proposition that there is a strong link between a national economy's current account balance and its government budget balance.[1]" 




 How so? 




 Economists say: 

Think about the comparative advantage of producing in "developing" countries! (This is a better term than "Third World", since this isn't a Cold War setting). 

We get cheap goods. Living Standards increase for developing countries. We specialize in something else rather than manufacturing. :) 




 It is giant space where there are lots of railroad tracks, truck/storage facilities, and lots of parking area near south Boston and the South End. 




 Yep. it is also interesting how they defend secret negotiations so that the USA will "gain from trade", so they can get the. "Best deal possible" even though it contradicts the idea that trade lifts all boats and there supposedly no overall "losers" in the macro sense in trade. 




 A mixture of sarcasm and presenting the economics of freetrade  




 Economists say that freetrade is always good. it is only bad news for a few people. Consumers, exporters, living standards for developing countries all gain from TPP. :) 




 No! Nearly all Academic scholars and economists say that freetrade is always good. :) 




 The Boston 2024 Main Olympic Stadium is a great location. 




 They have been known for weeks. I just wanted to know other potential relatively cheap defenders. 




 if TPP was the most "progressive" trade deal to ever be made to reduce the effects of outsourcing, environmental concerns, labor rights, human rights, poor quality control, etc, How does the Republican Party stand to gain from this trade deal? Do you really think that they will agree to a progressive trade deal? 




 TRADE! Are you against trade? Why dislike access to foreign goods and globalization? Say goodbye to cheap prices! Save manufacturing? modern Luddites? Protectionism? Bad economics much? 




 Doesn't economics have to do with government policy? Even the minimum wage topic causes headaches among experienced economists lol 




 It is secret because we need to make sure that US gains from trade and don't lose even though freetrade benefits everyone. 




 people should support TPP because freetrade is good. Most economists say so. Protectionism is bad. Living standards have increased across the world. Wouldn't you believe so from globalization? products are cheaper. Horray! Specialization for all countries. USA should outsource most of its manufacturing and shift to high tech!. trade deficits don't matter. Because consumers gains + our money is reinvested in capital will come back to the USA.  




 Toia isn't really a good pick because he has shown to get 1 point for games. If you have money, I recommend Polster.  




 Just agree with the trade bill because most to all economists say that trade = good :) 




 I just want to know some potential cheap defenders, who may or may not be semi-starters. It looks like they won't be, so.... I'll just keep my eye on them for the future :) 




 Dia is worth $4.5 million and in the last three games..... started for 90 minutes in each with clean sheets in all three. 

Marquez is worth $4.7 million and in the last 4 games... started for all 90 minutes and has two clean sheets.

 




 I had Deric, but I switched him out for Bush since he has fallen from his original 5.0 value. I could replace Ousted with Deric to save some money. Just need to hope Deric and Houston's defense will be better in the upcoming weeks. :\ 









 Which midfielder is better to get in round 15 and expect to be better/play more over the next 3 or 4 rounds? Kaka, Dempsey, Castillo, Nguyen? - all over $10.0 million 




 YES!! 




 Also governments can fiscally alter prices and costs of goods with subsidizes and regulations, so nothing is really free in trade. All Governments engage in some sort of protectionism. 




 The Republican Party used to be pro high tariffs to support US manufacturing. Democrats wanted low tariffs to export agriculture goods. 




 It is obvious since big businesses are the truly the only ones who can fully outsource production and gain profits. Can a small business decide that it wants to relocate? Is a consumer in a foreign country going to compare products between a small business and a big business American company? How many foreign companies are on par with Western big businesses in terms of size? Can migrants move to countries to strive for higher wages as easily as businesses can strive for lower costs? Should immigration be open doors for all countries to eliminate protectionism? 




 Mhm. Budget Deficits also don't matter. ;) 




 You would need major investments in High-Speed Rail, which is going cost upwards of 100+billion dollars to 1 trillion dollars intially.  




 Why should the Northeast fund small town airports in the middle of nowhere? Fund it yourselves! 




 Boo! Somebody in those states should campaign on increasing Amtrak spending in the next election. 




 Trade Deficits don't matter at all! ;) 




 Freetrade is good. We get cheaper products, more competition, more consumers of our goods, increased specialization (our economy = high tech), help developing countries, etc. economics 101

We should outsource our entire manufacturing overseas! Also trade deficits don't matter! Google it and you see articles saying that trade deficits don't matter. :) 




 Also watch Decoyroid, but it isn't really that great, since it doesn't lock with two decoyroids.  




 Dimension of Chaos has been rumored to have old roid support, but rumors are usually false.... :\ 




 {Cyber Summon Blaster} ? Special summoning of machine type roid monsters :) 




 Patroid is nearly useless because it has super low attack with the ability just to look at a set card in spell/trap zone. 




 I would keep an eye out on {{Jetroid}} 




 I say go with Arrieta because Espindola is injury prone and isn't good to have an inconsistent player. 




 Nearly all pro and relegation leagues favor a few good teams at the top because they have more money than the rest and players will inherently want to join them because they are "successful". 




 Bad idea 




 Yugo and Yuya probably have to merge after Yuya duels Jack. 




 Yugo and Yuzu are probably in the slums or in the city hiding. 




 Royal Magical Library will be limited or banned.  




 Some prices will rise because nobody knows the competitive effects of cros in the tcg game. 




 no since Nekroz will probably get hit in the next format. Stick with crossed souls. 




 D/D/D and Speedroids 




 It is already made..... 




 Syrus Truesdale Starter Deck? lol 




 TOP 350! :D 




 it will probably be blackwings since it is a fan favorite. 




 No because we are a republic. We shouldn't have 100+ amendments on a trade agreement or else the trade deal is too complicated.  




 because China makes our goods. If we shut them off, we would be in a recession with skyrocketing prices of goods.. 




 Economists say move to a different job. :) 




 If you are in Canada, then the setting should be pretty LGBT friendly. Of course, you always try to go to a locals with a more urban setting, since those settings tend to be more socially liberal than more rural settings. I mean.... you wouldn't want to go to a locals in rural Alberta, right? lol 




 I am not a member of the LGBT group, but it really depends on what your locals location is....

Also, I doubt people will notice, if you are "passable". Just make sure to keep the LGBT issue at a minimum.

Are you in a conservative or liberal state? Are you in a rural, small town, suburban, or urban setting? 




 Trade Deficits don't matter! :) 




 True. Also Trade Deficits don't matter because as long as we keep importing cheap goods more than we export in goods, we gain the benefits of a globalized trade. :D 




 The left should agree with TPP because it is a freetrade agreement which is good for everyone and helps developing countries. Nearly all economists say Trade is good. 




 The inability to get stuff done in a very gerrymandered, polarized, changing America.  




 No. If the GOP manages to nominate a moderate nominee in the general election, the GOP could win swing states as the rightwing groups will come out in force to vote. All of Obama's coalition of voters won't necessarily vote for Sanders.  




 Nope. Walmart is still in business as well as many others. :) 




 Nobody is listening because trade is always good. End all tariffs. we should outsource most of our manufacturing overseas because it will cost less, give us cheaper products, increase competition, and help developing countries reduce poverty. Trade Deficits don't matter. :)  




 Link to your post? :) 




 By the way, interesting subreddit... 




 Sure. 




 But freetrade helps developing countries and we get cheap products! ;) 




 True. Both parties had conservative, liberal, and moderate wings.  




 He also spent a lot of time on vacations and has been known to treat his fellow adminstration officials with authoritarian tone.  




 How about Nelson Rockefeller, who was booed during the 1964 GOP National Convention for denouncing "extremism" and for being too "liberal" and "moderate"?  




 He is the probably the best candidate within the GOP, who will get some Democratic Hispanic voters.  




 Then limit fiendish chains... 




 Throw in John Kasich who appeals to moderates and socially conservative liberals. 




 Jim Webb is a democrat... 




 I recommend 3 thunder dragons and 1 hand destruction. 




 Why? Just vote on one day or 1 week before for absentee voting, so campaigning is fair.  




 It doesn't make sense, since the GOP controls the House and the Senate. Also, do you really think the GOP has a comprehensive plan after cutting Amtrak spending and had many years to propose a long term plan for transportation? 




 then they complain that gas price increases are the fault of the president and when gas prices fall, then it isn't the president's policies.  




 tolls do divert traffic to roads without traffic which can be good for businesses in areas with low traffic congestion. 




 George Pataki - He is semi reasonable with some liberal views on economic policy and environmental policy but does have some neoconservative views with military, NSA, and Marijuana.

Rand Paul - Libertarian who has some views that are close to social liberalism but most of his economic policy is at odds with many progressives 

Marco Rubio - He is a candidate who appeals to Hispanics with general conservative views with a sprinkle of liberal view.
 




 He should get a trial, but he should be able to come back without spending most of his life in jail or receiving harm because he did expose some stuff that infringes on people's liberties, while did break some rules.  




 But... Well... Who wants to pay $4 per a gallon of gas? We need to go back to $1 per a gallon. ;)

We need to make sure that it drops to as low as possible.  




 Abolish the Gas Tax! ;)  














 Possible. Heavy Storm is another good option. Pendulums get sent to extra deck on both sides. 




 Giant Trunade might be better since konami doesn't want Raigeki and Harpies feather duster in the same formate for OTKs.  




 Giant Trunade is better since Pendulums can reset their scales and can change up scales, if they want.  




 Penguin soldier tier 1 




 Let them drill an make them complain about the health and environmental problems. 




 Who are you? 









 I know, but he might play 1 game like how Ishizaki might play one game.  




 Opare might not play 2 games for full 180 minutes. 




 Keep Kamara on Captain? :\ 




 I have Platti as a captain right now for the randomness, but I am probably going to choose Kamara, since Montreal and Philly's defenses aren't great.  









 Thanks for the comic! 




 Free-Trade is always good for America says most intelligent economists. Even if 5 chapters is  about trade, Lower Prices for Consumer means that overall welfare has increased. Trade is done in a comparative advantage way, which will boost more GDP. Do people really want tariffs everywhere?

Outsourcing and Automation is good for society, so we can focus on other industries.  




 Watch Nelson Rockefeller's speech to the GOP National Convention in 1964. Then, you compare it to Barry Goldwater's speech. You will see how the GOP has changed. 




 Watch Nelson Rockefeller's 1964 speech to the GOP national government. You will see how the GOP has changed. 




 Southern democrats and southern republicans voted against it. 




 Yes, but do the new kind of jobs replace the original aggregate demand done from worker wages?  




 Wages is demand. Machines don't buy stuff. machines also depend entirely on electricity and energy.
