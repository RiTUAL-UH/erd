 Nice spin, but as usual factually inaccurate (suggesting that *this* is what sets precedent for EPA to do cost-benefit, lol!)

I'll keep it nice and simple:

EPA was planning on taking costs into account at the next stage of the MATS development. SCOTUS says "Go ahead and do it now."

So this simply rearranges the timeline, doesn't invalidate the MATS and certainly doesn't change anything about CPP.  




 Did you mean CPP? 

Because like I just said, this [kicks out one of the legs of the CPP plaintiff's arguments](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-24/obama-may-win-by-losing-in-quirk-of-supreme-court-epa-review), that since coal plants are regulated under MATS they can't be under CPP. So unless you're seeing some  way for a new lawsuit because of the MATS ruling (which would be novel because IIRC the CPP already did the cost accounting that MATS didn't yet ) then I think you're mistaken.

If you did mean MATS, then it's still not accurate since this ruling just kicked the suit back down to the DC court to make the EPA consider costs now instead of later when designing the enforcement. Doesn't throw out the MATS rule, just says the EPA has to take costs into account. DC court may throw out the rule, but since it upheld the rule last time it's not likely to toss it now, but instead will probably just tell the EPA to go count costs, thereby just delaying enforcement.   




 Re: SCOTUS decision, you're confusing MATS with CPP. MATS ruling has no effect on CPP, except getting rid of one of the CPP critic's arguments (that emissions were already regulated under MATS so they couldn't be under the CPP.)  




 Haha yeah for some reason I didn't have that one saved...

 My coworker would like to know how you feel about climate change. 

And more importantly, if you're single?  




 Revenge is a dish best served cold. And moldy and decomposed past the point of all recognition because it's become fertilizer for a pretty flower and then you smell it and then OH NO THE SLOWVENGE IS UPON YOU!  














 It's all about Catholic's support, or lack thereof, of policy action on climate. That's policy! 

Then it talks about the reason-their dedication to free market policies! 

Then it ends with the GOP candidate reactions- politics! 

Gotta say, this is definitely on-topic. 




 No, that's why everyone else rejects him.  




 Aww you shoulda left it it was funny! 

But the article is explaining why, in this case, the Catholics are breaking with tradition and thinking he's full of shit. But by and large they don't, because then they wouldn't really be Catholics.  




 Maybe that's why you and others are rejecting it, but that doesn't make any sense as to why Catholics are. Because Catholics, basically by definition, don't think the Pope's full of shit or that secularism will "whipe" out religion. 

(Seriously, whipe? Who're you, Stewie Griffin??)  














 And the choice couldn't be easier. 

Obviously Mammon. I mean, what'd God ever do for 'em?

 There have been a bunch of cases in this vein, this is the first to have a win. So that does set a precedent for other states, but some of those other states have already ruled against it. 

Which sets it up for SCOTUS!

 It's my paraphrasing of paragraphs 4-6:

"Yet, there is a marked lack of publicly available information and analysis which would help New Zealanders decide on the best course of action."

The government had hurried its consultation process on its a negotiating position in the United Nations Paris meeting on climate change in December last year, to a period less than four weeks.

The NZAS was concerned about the lack of publicly available information, as well as the minimal involvement of key New Zealand state-owned research institutes and universities. 




 No way that 2500+ comment count was accurate. I get every parent level comment in my inbox, and there haven't been that many comments. 

Plus only super-popular posts get that many comments, this one was pretty slow to move up.  




 In this case it's that only the federal-government-dependent research body was given the opportunity to provide input on NZ's position in the UN climate negotiations. Other academic institutions, including state-owned research centers and universities weren't consulted and weren't didn't have access to the data. 

So by shutting them out of the process, they were denied the ability to provide their scientific input, i.e. were gagged.  




 It's both a classic rhetorical tool (accuse someone of your weakness, so that when they then point out that it's your weakness, they look like they're just saying 'no u') and an example of the increasingly common conservative tactic of appropriating the language of the oppressed to create a persecution complex. (Think "War on Christmas" or "Take back our country" or "Men's rights.")  




 ...why the exclusion of Title+Quote? Seems like if title is allowed, and quote is allowed, then the combination should be allowed. I feel like quotes without the context of a title aren't going to make sense, and submissions with the flashiest quote that may or may not represent the full article (as a title would) are going to proliferate. 

Which means that the mods will now have to subjectively decide if a quote is an accurate representation because the title is no longer there to provide an overview of the whole piece.  




 For a second I read that as "lol Apocalypse" and now all I can think is how "Apocalypse Lol" would make a great name for a documentary about climate denial...
