 exactly why i want to kill myself now 




 i just want someone to hang out with, someone to watch films with, something real ! all i want is something real with a girl i care about, not a girlfriend not marriage just something real with a girl  




 thanks for giving me the same cliched answers everyone else has. i appreciate your trying to help but telling me 'it will get better' doesn't fucking help. it doesn't get better for everyone, so unless you have a crystal ball i don't want empty meaningless reassurances, sorry but I'm so fucking sick of the bullshit lines you've just fed me.  




 I'm just doing what the doctors have told me to do, I'm doing everything right and its really upsetting me, thats the problem all I'm plagued with now are the good memories from our relationship thats the only feeling of being content i have had so I'm constantly plagued and poisoned with thoughts of her, they tell me there called ruminating thoughts from the anxiety. its a fucking poison and all my ambitions and hope for my life, writing something that changes the world, hearing a girl say she loves me, being happy and okay with myself, not needing approval from everyone else. it all just seems like vein pipe dreams people keep telling me i'll be happy one day. well for some people it doesn't get better what if its like this for 10 years, fuck that.i don't want a life of mediocrity i'd rather die 




 Have depression and anxiety i've had it since i was 16-17 (I'm 21 now), i only started doing something about it in december because this is all i know so i didnt think anything was wrong, i thought everyone felt like this because i had no feeling of contentness to compare it too. got into a relationship and i still felt the same although i had some superficial happiness, i thought something must be wrong, got broken up with two days after christmas out of the blue after spending christmas with her family, my family was on holiday so i was left alone broken up with for the rest of the holidays. she lives next door and had the same circle of friends so i still had to see her everyday (i felt like this way before her so this isn't a my girlfriend broke up with me I'm so sad story) i started with counselling and medication to combat this depression started exersiing more and tried everything in the book, eventually to suicidal and tried hanging myself a bunch of time, got sent into a mental hospital for a week, got kicked out of my university house and banned from talking to all my "friends" and ex because of my 'behaviour' by which they mean my depression. now I'm left alone in a flat still suicidal, toy with the idea of killing myself every day, last night i spent 5 hours standing on a train platform trying to be brave enough to do it. 

this is the edited version maybe one day i'll write a directors cut.  




 would be nice if someone cared i guess, i dunno, I'm not sure why i came here 




 i've tried 5 times now and i haven't relized i want to live. i don't want to live i quite fancy dying  




 why ? i'll be brave enough to do it then
 




 I'm hoping to get drunk enough so i have the guts to follow through this time

i appreciate everyones help, i won't forget it anyway i've got a thing to do 









 im sick of explaining myself to people like a million times a day with no progress being made. I'm sure there ver professional but i struggle to think what words could bring me back 




 sure !

 




 really fighting the urge to go outside and hang myself right now. I'm fucking begging  




 yeah I'm sick of being treated like a number, i understand that doctors see tons and tons of patients a day but you cant just shove any pill down my throat and tell me to be on my way 




 i just came here for a goodbye kind of thing, spent months talking to a billon different doctors  




 I've been trying everything, medication,therapy,hobbies,exercise, it doesn't change, I'm fucking so over this its beyond belief, I'm over this illness turning me into a week pathetic loser who crys uncontrollably, and cuts himself. this isn't me and its got a firm grasp on me that i cant shake off. i guess I'm posting here because i have none else to tell, all my friends have dropped me or been told toy drop me because I'm a burden, so sorry if I'm burdening you guys but fuck it. yeah i dunno bye i guess, 

see you guys on the other side  




 Will do ! i've already contacted a club and I'm going to start in the summer, cant wait to be part of a team again, had a rough year so far  




 Thanks for the reassurance i appreciate it  




 Yep just contacted a club, man I'm excited ! thanks for the reassurance  




 Hey guys I'm a huge rugby fan and played through the minis up until under 15s and i'd love to get back into the game ads i've always been a fan, I'm 22 is it too late ? can i just join a club how does it work ? 

Thanks  




 you're not bothering i just don't want to be any trouble, i really appreciate the concern, i don't want to come of as ungrateful  




 i've done everything they've told me too, doctors,medication,therapy,reached out to friends (lost them for it because i was 'burdening them) I'm losing the will to fight with every passing second.

I didnt come here to attention seek i apologise if it comes off like that   




 yep 




 Would anyone like to make my wordpress site look cool, I'm a writer and I'm crap at this whole website stuff anyone fancy it ? 




 You didnt bother me i appreciate the concern.  




 man I'm seeing counsellors and taking meds for years its tough  




 i've felt like this since i was 16 so i don't know anything else, i have no feeling of contentness to compare it to, which is the scary thing  




 Yep i have multiple times  




 i hate seeing happy couples and i hate seeing happy people because I'm lonely depressed and suicidal as fuck 




 calm down tommy lee  




 i got moved out of my university accommodation and banned from talking to my friends because the higher-ups said i was 'Burdering them' the thing about mental illness, people just don't get it  




 ' Then others must use violence to protect themselves'  




 you certainly seemed to be trying to justify this guys crime 




 so you think murder is okay ?  




 im 21 severely depressed and suicidal, and i've done everything possible medication counsellors doctors therapy.and i really don't know how much longer i can take. 

please don't give me crap because I'm young  




 oh god don't wake an adorable baby at my expense ! and excuse my ignorance but what is an RSS feed ?  









 Hey everyone although i've made some enemies here and i've generally said stupid things at times, i really wanted to say thanks before i did it. anyway love this subbreddit and love everyone on here, you're all really friendly and easy to get along with and talk too, couldn't praise the subreddit any higher, anyway i don't have anyone else to thank or to say nice things too, due to this black hole I'm in and due to the nature of the illness its getting tougher and tougher, but thats neither here nor there, don't worry about my shit, i just wanted to say thanks so much for making this subbreddit awesome and thanks for putting up with me, cya 

xx 




 Sorry i no its no excuse but i have dyslexia which makes it hard sometimes, but thanks so much for the feedback ! 




 haha im glad :) 




 it made perfect sense !

 I feel like an asshole now, i've always been the less empathetic type when it comes to homelessness, I'm gonna try and change, man i feel like a dick 




 i agree with you a limit would be great. i guess it just feels cheap to me, kind of feels like this sub is being used for cheap youtube likes  




 what an innovate new idea ! 




 i just don't think thats what makes this subreddit really good, i don't think youtubers posting there content hoping for cheap likes is what makes the subreddit what it is 




 well i like this subreddit so i wanted to share my opinion   because i think the subreddit would be a lot better off without 'work the space' videos being posted every 6 fucking seconds 




 i have no problem with pics or anything like that i love most of the content on here ! I'm just saying I'm not okay with the self-promotion 'heres my series give it a like and subscribe' and all that jazz, thats not good content its cheap is what it is. all i see here half the time is fucking 'work the space' videos, i mean jesus christ 




 I'm just giving my opinion on the matter if thats allowed. i think  a subreddit full of youtubers promoting their own videos is a good thing,  like i said just giving my opinion if thats allowed  




 I'm just saying i don't want a subbreddit full of people promoting their own shit  




 *cunt  




 because i don't want this subreddit to be full of people promoting their own shit, 'Hey guys i've just started a series' is that what everyone wants ?

 I worked in the walkie talkie for a summer ! 




 when you stop getting excited about snow and start getting annoyed by it  




 focus on showing it not saying it 




 thank you so much for caring 




 i mean i guess i don't know but i want to be hopeful i honestly do but I'm just not 




 i want to be a strong fighter but I'm weak and pathetic 




 why ? 




 i do and although they've been really sweet my friends and family are struggling to get there head round the gravity of my situation  




 thanks i think getting some fresh air always helps  




 i've felt like this for like 2 years though. I'm tired of it. i don't want to wait till I'm 30 to be happy  




 i've been really depressed for a few years now, and I'm sick of feeling like this everyday, its no life to lead, i don't want to fight against the currant anymore, if that makes sense. i feel like it would be better if i just let myself drown rather than fight the currant  




 i love telling jokes, listening to music and writing but lately i haven't found pleasure in anything  




 but what life is that, doing this everyday, thats no life 




 its gonna sound silly, but I'm 21 




 i cant take feeling like this for another 10 years, i cant fight the tide anymore I'm sick of it 









 being depressed like this for the rest of my life, 21 




 I'm sorry to just come here like this, makes me feel pretty selfish. i enjoy reading listening to music, watching films and telling jokes 




 I dunno why i'm here i guess i cant really talk to my friends or family about stuff like this, i've been selfish enough lately with the depression and stuff anyway,  this isn't an attention thing i guess i just don't want to be this unhappy anymore, i want to be happy and full of joy not feeling like this all day everyday it really sucks and i just don't want to be alive anymore, this isn't life this is no life at all. i just want to die 




 to be honest i never really feel like I'm beating it. it really sucks  




 when i let me depression get the better of me
