 If Cavs fans can complain about that, Warriors fans can complain about this 




 Warriors were down 3 at that point, and then the subsequent free throws put the Cavs up 5 with about a minute left, to say it didn't at least effect the game is ridiculous  




 Lol Lebron gets slide tackled like that, Cavs fans go apeshit 




 Im sorry but that slide tackle by Lebron was bullshit, all that aside we saw curry begin to wake up, but that doesn't mean anything if can't carry into the next game. 




 Network? 




 Klay should have taken the last shot 




 The Warriors are playing 2k basketball, 3's everywhere, all misses 




 That's what they said about Harden in 2012  




 So SPEIGHTS......missed dunk...... 




 SPEIGHTS WHY! 




 Klau losing that potential Finals MVP if this is a loss 




 Thanks Magic 




 Curry hasn't even taken a shot yet either, Cavs look like this is the best we'll see of them tonight 




 Anyone else feel the Warriors are obviously the superior team just from what we've seen so far 




 Allegedly! 7 semen samples! Where is Ja!  




 Broken arms 




 Stay? 




 Groundhog Day? 




 Borat? 




 Amelie 




 Delly's in, GET CURRY OUT 




 Lebrons foot was on the line for a three awhile back just sayn 




 Prediction: Curry gonna attempt the 3 miss, Bogut rebounds, kicks out to Klay misses, rebound bogut, kick to Curry BANG 




 Now let's go, just give me the signal 




 I hope I'm not the only one who watches the Game 7 mini movie almost every month to just relive those memories. 




 North by Northwest 














 uhhhhhhhh 




 Man, you've got a face for radio 




 ONLY 4 HOURS FUUUUUUUUUUUUU 




 Hot streak, it was crazy and didn't amount to anything :(
