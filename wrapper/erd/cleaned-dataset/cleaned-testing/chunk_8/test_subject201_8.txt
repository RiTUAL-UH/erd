 I actually went there to try to find it and was like da fuck? 




 My bands name was Afghan Banana Stand. We got a picture of the bass player holding our album in one hand and a beer in the other that night. I tried to find the picture but the last time I saw it it was on myspace so yeah... 




 [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIlwIuN-z2g#t=55s) is the part where the mouse drives the car... 




 I actually got to open for these guys in Portland Maine about 5 years ago with my old band. We got to hang out with them after the show hand an awesome time. Nice post 




 I about shit myself when that part come on. 




 Is it wrong to feel hatred towards these type of people or should I feel sympathy for them? This whole damn world just really saddens me... or at least 90% of it. 




 A NOFX FAN! Nice to meet you kind sir. 




 Free ham 




 Fat Mike makes that joke somewhere on [THIS](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqv3qm9In01qfzrl3.jpg) album. Its after one of the songs. 




 No. Not really.  




 YES! I was really hoping someone would pick up on that.
 




 They must serve Hitler brand ice cream. It has little tiny nutzies in it. 




 And they still have a baseball league!

 Dude, I love your sense of humor. In the modern times we live in there is no fucking need to have 19 kids. Nice job! 




 Classic aunt paddy. 




 Hes like a tiny hillbilly Mainer I tell you what bub.
 




 As a graduate in new media the shots were very well done as well as the sound and content. Nice job with the rocket take off shots too. Did you use a drone to get those shots?  









 I was sitting at my desk and heard some drops of rain on my air conditioner a few hours ago and it made me happy. A few hours later I went for a drive by myself and Pink Floyd's song "wish you were here" came on and I smiled. That was a perfect moment and I was happy.  




 Les is the shit. He doesn't go into this with a bias like other shows. He has the mind set that he has no idea whats out there and just wants the truth. Compared to other shows where they hear a twig break and yell SQUATCH!  




 This is a good point but I feel like I might get harassed for asking such a touchy subject in a religious sub. Ya know? maybe not.  




 I understand your reasoning and thank you for your input but wouldn't that mean human nature or nature in general is more powerful? Thats how I interpret it. 




 Lets say a religious person is in a situation where they are close to death but still have a chance. Why does the will to live usually win the battle when the other option is heaven or what pertains to that individual. To me this means that within even the most hardcore religious person there is a fraction of doubt. How would you translate this contradiction? What are other peoples thoughts on this. 




 bingo 




 I hear ya man. About their juices tho, he makes some of the best juices Ive tried. The Cirrus is the key lime pie in the chassing clouds series and I like that one a lot but next time your in try the stratus. I liked that one for a long time but moved on. Right now im vaping crunch berry he made. Its not out to buy yet but if you ask theyll make it for you. What you usally do for juice?
 




 Yea thats the one I go too. What did you think I love that place
 




 Thank you! much appreciated man 




 Yea, do I know you? 




 Its on there cause its my local shop and represent right? Its just blank wood underneath. As you guys pointed out the sticker is pretty bad looking so when I get some time im going to take it off and do some more wood burning. Any ideas design ideas? im trying to stick with a rustic almost ancient look but im open to any suggestions.   




 Thanks man! Been watching to much CKY. IM talking like em now! 




 Ha yea it does. The stain has been rubbed off from so much use, Its been dropped, and Ive also had to fix it a few times. But overall the patina looks cool. 




 I swear I was!  




 Im a perfectionist so when I look at the one I already made I see every damn thing thats wrong so I kinda just want to do the same type of mod again. Plus it would be fun to do some more wood burning. 




 Oh yea, another thing thats good is If anything ever goes wrong I can fix it myself. I know every grain of wood in that sucker haha
 




 You would think that but it dosn't. and When I hold it my hand isnt near it
 




 This is my hand made variable wattage OKR wooden box mod I made myself. It includes a master on/off switch, fire button, potentiometer, blue LED, and a 5/10 thread to mount any RDA. The internal components include a battery sled, 2 Sony VTC5s all copper wiring, zenor diode, an OKR 1/10 variable wattage chip, a few capacitors, and 4 rare earth magnets to hold on the lid. The wood is hand cut and worked using mahogany and I used guerrilla wood glue to attach the corners. From there I sanded it and stained it.Then did some wood burning  As you can see its a bit haggard from lots of use. It isn't perfect but its something I made and have pride in and something no one else has. This is the first one I've built so the next one I build should be an improvement. Anyways I thought Id share. Open to any questions or critiques.

 Then why does it say Cincinnati on the box? Maybe it is a artifact or something that has to do with time travel but they found it there instead at the ski lodge. 




 It doesn't take a scientist to figure that one out. So far your very credible. This is called sarcasm. However, I will answer this... JUST BECAUSE your not being rude *as much*. No I do not think this theory is 100% fucking correct. However plausible because we can not see inside a black hole. Maybe someday we will create something that can pass near the event horizon on a rotating weak black hole and I will be proved wrong (probably not). Until that that day shut the fuck up and stop trying to prove yourself on a fucking Reddit comment section. 




 I do believe. I DO I DO I DOOOOOOOO. -- Also Very scientific. 




 ...oh wait --- this. SCIENCE!
