 Some did 




 I masturbate with my left hand because it feels better even though Im a righty. Thats kind of the same thing right? 




 Poop is sacred, talk about it.  




 I love the way you cant cut with normal scissors. 




 Yea, wrong bacon.  




 Not if you dont let it.  




 /u/preggit 




 Yea thats true. My reply was really snarky.  




 Cuz I saw that dick pic you posted and it made me so hard. I just imagined stroking it while my hard cock throbbed under my underwear.  I want to suck you off untill you cum all over my face and then when you do I can bite your dick off and swallow it and feel your hard black cock in my tummy so you will always be a part of me. And then I will stretch out your new hole and stick my dick in it. And I will start fucking you with our bloody lube while you squirm and scream and it will be so hot. And then when I cum I wanna go down on your hole and suck out our bloody cum mixture while it drips down my chin. 

 




 And that sucks but you are just unlucky. Statistically there is a correlation between things like smoking and lung cancer,  or wearing sun screen and skin cancer. 

Yea yea its "risk factors" but it still reduces your chances and if you dont take statistics personally, there does appear to be some relation.  




 Be the change you want to see in the world. Start the conversation with people! Next time you are out at a restaurant turn around to the girl at the table behind you and ask them about backsplash. 




 A goth/emo phase but im fat. So skinny jeans and black shirts on a fat kid. 

And screamo and sounding like a fool when I tried to scream. 

Cringe bro

 Estimates though.  if I said 5k that is also technically wrong. And 4k is in the range of "give or take"

Also, you replied to yourself, not me. So, you h8 yourself? 




 Yes 




 When a small business is starting up they arent profitable for the first year or so. And for the next year they may be just about cutting even. A small increase in costs would hurt. 

Where as a large corporation can shift around a few million here and there when shit happens and not bat an eye.  




 Yea, we need more tax laws 














 20 bucks give or take, so 20-5k is negative 4.98k, which means they give you 4k.  




 Me or the other guy?

 I agree with this guy.  




 I wish 




 Because it is an extension of humans and humans are dicks. But humans are also nice and very sweet and you will find that on reddit as well. 




 Woah, they will give me 4k to do it? 




 And large corporations will find ways around it like firing people and cutting other things. The small business cant afford to let go of their one or two employees.  

Small family run businesses would get screwed harder than it seems on the surface.  




 Sounds like a good start 




 I bet your dad takes bubblebaths though.  




 Just like feminism and many other "movements."

The edgy 13 year olds are more vocal and annoying and end up becoming the face of the movement because the serious ones arent forcing their opinion on people and trying to do something about what they believe. 

The same with religion, many people think a lot of Christians are like the Westboro baptist church but in reality the ones I have met are nice and make a difference in their communities. But WBC gets media attention because they whine the loudest. 

And I have met good athiests too. And I have met decent feminists too. 

But you are right, it is comical how the image of all these movements is what they tried to fight.  




 Or you got a lot of bullets and a good vest 




 People tend to wait for their turn to talk about their opinion than to actually listen to your argument.  




 Coke with anything strawberry or cherry flavored.

 Sex with a 16 year old when you are 23 in florida.  




 A couple weeks ago I went to the bank and withdrew the some money. She asked me how I wanted it, meaning denomination. I said "oh cash is fine" misunderstanding or being distracted or whatever. Then she stared at me for a couple seconds until I said "oh, um, 20s"

Her look of "wow this idiot" makes me cringe and die a lil every time I remember, which, the way my mind works, is every 5 minutes.  




 Cars are already better than humans in test conditions. 

The only things that humans excel at is adaptability to new situations.   




 Are they self driving? 




 The Hr chick that was handling my last job kept returning my emails as undeliverable because the recipient's mailbix was full, which usually means they dont work there. Except when I emailed other HR people they told me to email her..

 You dont puke every day? Weirdo.  




 Nah, 8 is too old 




 Many of us identify as the nerdier types. This show is based around mocking the nerdy types.  Thats offensive. Also, many of the things in the show are dumbed down or just plain wrong and thats annoying if you actually understand or know about what they are talking about. So while it appeals to the majority of people, the vocal majority of reddit is not exactly its demographic.  




 Stick to your username.  




 Also, walking too close to people. Close enough to slam into them if they stop suddenly.  




 Chewing with your mouth open. I work with a lot of foreigners and it blows my mind how that is ok in oyher parts of the world. It is obnoxious, gross, and annoying.  




 /r/gasmaskgirls 




 Mmm 




 Not from the UK but I have heard about them on reddit, and that's the truth right there! 

 




 Depends on the delivery method. Rudy once dared me to snort it and like hell I would turn down a dare. Well, I couldnt see for a day, had a headache for 3 days, and tasted apple juice for the next week.  




 Nothing. 

You will get ugly houses from the outside and they turn out to be nice on the inside, and vice versa. 

I met a kid in elementary school that was so sweet and softspoken. He always shared everything and complimented people and was polite to teachers. But when we hung out we would ride our bikes around outside or he would come over to my house. But we never went to his house. 

One day someone brought up this and they kept pressuring him to let them in. One kid even followed him home a couple times. It was weird. Anyways, a couple years later after we are friends for a while he let me in his house. 

It was gross in there, his mom was a hoarder and had trash everywhere, he had three older sisters and two of them had their own kids living there, his grandma and his dad and apparantly an uncle who just moved out had lived there. It was like 12 people in a small 2 bedroom house. The walls and carpet were dirty and it was all messed up. 

But he was always clean, his nails cut and hair in place. The outside looked good and I had no idea that was inside.

His mom had some mental issues and wasnt working and his dad was supporting all of them so they lived so poorly because of that. And I remembered years before when we made a big deal cuz he didnt let us in. I wouldn't let me in either. Kids are cruel. 

And im sure the reverse happens where unkept looking houses look ok in the inside. You cant judge a house by its outside and you cant judge people by their houses or their families.  




 Because you dont hear about it plastered all over the news.  




 You can be, if you use it right. 




 Marry them 




 Talk to them and tell them they exhibit this behavior and that it is annoying. Tell them you are happy for them when they win and would like for them to be happy for you every now and then too. And if that doesnt work than they might be a bit immature and you have to start xonsidering if you want to be with that type of person or if everything else that they bring outweighs one small, or not so small, flaw.  




 Just come out the closet man. Theres a support system for you.  




 I used to think that beer was urine and that grown men ran around drinking urine.

 Link karma isnt real karma compared to comment karma.

 Apples dont grow all the time so when they are in season they harvest a bunch extra and store them so that they can steadily distribute them throughout the year. This is why you always have a fresh supply of nice apples where as other fruits and vegetables are always out of season. The way that they keep the apples so long, in addition to selecting seeds for long lasting apples, is that they can control the atmosphere around the apple. Its oxygen for the most part that causes an apple to ripen and change colors and eventually go bad. 

So they store crates of apples in this huge wharehouse with a low oxygen, high nitrogen and other gas mixture. 

Now, the way OP's pic happens is that over the months of storage as the gas levels drop and humans enter and all that, some gasses escape this wharehouse and the nitrogen levels drop. You will get on the top crates apples that start aging much quicker. I have seen this happen, I play an apple engineer on reddit and have absolutely no idea what I am talking about. 

The apple in OP's pic must have been at a boundary of the nitrogen and other gas mixture and the top half was exposed to oxygen and started aging and the bottom half was in this cryogenic life preserving gas and didnt age at all. You can trust me. I swear.  




 Thanks lol. And I googled before posting, and that guy was wrong.  




 Here's the thing. You said a "pelican is a seagull."

Is it in the same class? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a redditor who studies pelicans, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls seagulls pelicans. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying "aves class" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of aves, which includes things from shoebills to sea eagles to toucans.

So your reasoning for calling a seagull a pelican is because random people "call the white ones pelicans?" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A seagull is a seagull and a member of the aves class. But that's not what you said. You said a pelican was a seagull, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the aves class pelicans, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds pelicans, too. Which you said you don't.

It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

 




 Mine 




 Checkmate athiests 




 Yep 




 Yea I agree with you. It was sarcasm. That is the usual excuse the government gives in these cases and it is stupid but some people still eat it up and that is incredibly dangerous as you said.  




 I thought it was obvious sarcasm, but maybe not 




 But reddit imgur, amirite guise? cuz imgur only exists cuz of us so their community is baseless and not allowed to be their own.  




 Your normal user that wants to download that one lizzie maguire album and just read a tutorial from 2007, yea. Just because you know how to use a different DNS doesnt mean the "average" garden variety one off torrenter knows how to.  




 Then if you arent doing anything illegal why dont you just use a normal browser so we can track you and use it against you later? If you arent doing anything illegal then you dont have a reason to hide. Only criminals hide really, so clearly everyone on tor is a criminal.  




 While google's and Microsoft's policies may not be the best, there are still laws in the US. I doubt a judge would allow that on the off chance that they might be hosting tpb. It is akin to a judge granting a search warrant just in case you might be breaking the law. There has to be some evidence that they are actually using one of those servers, the same way that there has to be some evidence of you doing something or some reasonable suspicion that you are involved for a search warrant to be granted. 

Now, that doesnt stop the possibility of a idiot judge letting it through or the government using shading NSA tactics and then making up a paper trail later to say it was legal, which they arent unkown to doing. 

But with that said, I doubt it would be all that difficult to trace if one of your users was hosting a certain site, but im only a lawyer and web dev on reddit and have no experience with either in real life so im just talking out my ass. Tpb guys are smart and have a complicated system of redirects going on so its not like google can just check and say "oh this user is sending a lot to this ip that belongs to tpb." And for the same reason it is hard to track from the website to the server it is really being hosted on.  




 God doesnt real, lel 




 Got me my last date.  




 Dont worry about it too much. Just stop thinking about them watching you because they arent watching you, they are busy worring about you watching them, which you arent, because you are too busy thinking about them watching you while they are not watching you. Savy?

And you dont have to mantain eye contact every second.  Thats actually weirder than watching someone eat. Just look at your food and eat, and occasionally look up to make eye contain and verify to the other person you are still engaged.

 As a bisexual, vegan atheist parent I am offended by your comment.

 I woke up and had wet the bed.  




 Sing up for a reddit account. 




 Sleep. It feels so good, bare skin on crisp white sheets is amazing. Right after a shower, crawling into a warm bed is the best.  




 Gotta get on reddit bruh.  




 What did you do? 




 Listen to hybrid theory in order, the whole thing. Just do it.

 Monkey burger. So good. Havent had one in like a year.  




 I had sex once... 




 Stop controlling me. Let me do my own shit. Im 24 and dont care that you hate my SO, its my decision.  I dont have to call you every day to tell you what im doing, sorry if I get busy with work, im an adult now. Yea I have my own preferences now. Sorry I dont cut my hair the way you made me for 2 decades, I never liked it and can do it my way now. Stop complaining about it every time you see me. And sorry I havent started a phd yet... its my choice to do that when I want. A masters is enough for now, and you dont realize that the research isnt trivial. Dont belittle my job because you dont understand it. Im really not a bad kid, im just not you.  




 Yea especially when you are in an LDR. The sex is way less than you would like and so, yea.  




 Freeze. Just realizing that I never scream, stand still when im scared, and just generally stop and think everything, well overthink everything, through and eventually end up missing my opportunity most times.  









 My mom doesnt like my boyfriend either.

 When you move things you require energy. the faster they move, the more energy they need. When you make your car go faster, for example, it burns more gasoline. Well, the math says that if you wanted to make your car move at the speed of light,  you would actually need infinite energy. 

You cant have infinite energy. So you cant go the speed of light.  




 I like free 




 Why do we care about the button at all? I mean it's an interesting game of keeping the number away from zero, but other than that, this sub is devoid of content. Nothing beyond 6 colors and a timer. Yet why do we care so much about this program which in reality doesn't affect our lives at all?

(btw If you don't like reading, go read the TL;DR at the bottom)

I have watched this sub ever since the day it was born, and it has been interesting seeing the masses get so "excited" about this april fools joke. (Just to be sure I'm not saying that this whole sub isn't *nothing* but an april fools joke, the users have definitely turned this sub into something of meaning for themselves). But there shouldn't be this passion for the button. There is literally no earthly reason for there to be factions of colors and "discrimination" between them. And yet there is a community for it.

This whole brouhaha is very reminiscent of twitch plays pokemon. Yet the difference between twitch plays pokemon and r/thebutton is that watching a character being controlled by thousands of people in a game that almost everyone inputting commands has played is much more compelling to watch and to be apart of than watching a timer. And so the people who were a part of twitch plays pokemon *had* *a* *reason* to sit there and watch the screen. But watching the character get on and jump off a ledge became repetitive. So repetitive in fact that they gave personality to the pokemon (Abby, bird jesus, the false prophet). Those who watched created a religion (Praise helix). They tried to create reasons for why certain things happened (why they looked at the helix fossil so often). They were confronted with a void, and subsequently tried to fill it. And it was wonderful. It was arguably one of the greater internet sensations of this decade. And those who were *in* on it from the beginning had pride in what they were a part of. They felt like they belonged somewhere.

Now, once again we were confronted with something that is community based yet devoid of reliable entertainment. Many recognised this and tried to recreate the magic of TPP. The same thing could be argued for the Orangered/Periwinkle april fools. Hell, this sub was probably inspired by that.

 But this isn't TPP. There is no reason to stay in this sub beyond literally watching a timer. It was soon apparent that it was difficult creating any meaningful OC, so we turned to something which worked before, factions/religions. Only this time, it was artificial. It grew too quickly, and was simply too forced to be anything like TPP. But we ignored the elephant in the room. We closed our eyes, put our hands over our ears, and shouted about how much fun this was.

Every person is desperate for a sense of belonging. We want to feel like they are a part of the group. We all want to be accepted. We all want to be able to say something, and have someone else back us up. Some of the actions on this sub can be attributed to this need of acceptance, but can you seriously argue that this many religions and factions can be created so quickly? For something that is so meaningless? 

This whole sub is a circlejerk. Just social masturbation about how awesome we all are for choosing to take sides over pressing the button. We are all self aware about this situation. No one is seriously thinking that red's are better than purple's. They just want others to think, "woah those guys are so wacky, they created a whole RELIGION. They are so dedicated for something so meaningless. They are sooooooo interesting and funny". 

This whole sub, down to it's very roots, is fake. And by saying that, I'm not saying that greys don't hate purples (not only because it's so freaking obvious), I'm saying that the very reason for typing in the words "filthy pusher" isn't *because* of the community. The people who type in "filthy pusher" are trying to *create* a community. They are trying to create a community that wouldn't have ever come about on its own. That is what is fake about all this. Its kind of sad in a way.

This sub is great as an idea, but everyone is so freaking self-aware of what they are doing. I know what this april fools joke was supposed to do. To create divide between people just like the Orangered/Periwinkle did. Except this time everyone knew how to act, and overemphasized the factions despite there being no reason to be on this sub at all. The Orangered/Periwinkle thing worked because it was the entirety of reddit, people had a reason to go on reddit that was much greater than simply bashing the other color.

Now this may not matter to you, but for me, I really hate it when people try to indirectly steer a topic/community/conversation/idea/etc into a direction it would have never gone to if we all would have just called out the bullshit. Call me cynical, but let things grow naturally on their own.

TL;DR 

**This sub's community is not 'real' in a sense. It has never been honest. People realized that, and forced it in anyway. The only reason why this bastardized community exists is because we all want to be a part of the next TPP or Orangered/Periwinkle.**


 














 Ive never done it before in a speedsolving sense. I l've played around with roux before but never really done serious solves. I was dumb and didnt review some stuff before I began the solves or practice or whatever. I ended up figuring out to place DF and DB, then orient and then permute. And I knew the orientation algs from bld and I use [MU] algs for H and Z perms but the second solve I got a U perm.  I completely froze and then messed up. I ended up figuring out to use MU2M'U2 which is a 3-cycle I use in bld, and then just setting up the U perm to be solved with that alg. 

Once I figured that out and got the hang of it, the last 3 solves went ok.

 This seems like an excellent method.  I was doing zz before but I might switch to this. Do you have a website with algorithms or something?

Step 6 looks a little tricky, but I guess its comparable to Eoline or something.  




 Dude, the yellow cross. its done already. Thats it. Then you move on to step 2.  




 Im not a cfop solver anymore, but here is some motivation for [multislotting]( http://cubeloop.com/?page_id=327). Also check out badmephisto's [advanced f2l]( http://badmephisto.com/f2l.php). 

Note that the most improvement can be found in first moving your normal f2l algs into muscle memory (so practice on not intuitively breaking up the pair and doing sexymove) and also on getting good at look ahead (while doing the cross start tracking the first pair and while executing each pair start tracking the next pair). Some thing that will help with look ahead is to slow down and plan ahead as far as you can, speed will come with time. 

That said, on to multislotting. Something you can do is when you get a scramble, redo the scramble multiple times and try to solve a different f2l pair first each time. By mixing up how you do them, you might find that after execution, the next pair is lined up perfectly. When you see this, stop and undo what you did. Check the pattern and try to memorize it. Write it down somewhere. Then later on when you are solving, see if you can fit the pieces into some of those patterns you found.

 But for things like k4 or a jumping off point to zbll, they are good to have. And with practice it can get close. After COLL, 75% of the time you will have a U perm or a skip. I think that makes up for it.  




 Ive read that about sune cases. Everyone seems to hate them. The recognition is not too hard. At least not as bad as people make it seem. Look for a pair of opposite stickers on the top layer. They will either be diagonal, horizontal, or vertical. Once you found those two stickers, you only need to match one more. 

For example,  for sune (do antisune on a cube to set it up now so you can see what I am saying) you have the diagonal case. U of UFR and U of UBL are opposites. I like to match with L of ULF and so I check and find that U of UBL matches L of ULF. So that is sune. 

If, instead UBL and LFU didnt match (do R U2 r' F R' F' r U' R U' R' U2 to set it up) you see the diagonal like for sune, and then you see that UBL and LFU dont match, so you know to do the other alg. 

For the vertical bar case (UFR and URB are adjacents) you have to make a slight modification and compare URB with LFU because UBL isnt part of the pair. 

Niklas is a horizontal bar (UBL and URB adjacents) with no match (UBL and LFU are different)

It takes some practice but I find that its not much more difficult than the bowtie cases. 




 **2x2**: 10.48, 15.81,9.48,19.51,12.08 = 12.79

**3x3**: 29.18, 29.56, 27.18, 23.73,27.07=27.81

**4x4**: 3:11, 2:48,3:30,3:07,2:14=3:02

**OH**: 59.45,54.04,56.89,1:07.59,45.57=56.79

**2gen**:12.27,10.74,7.55,26.98,10.60=11.2

**LSE**: 2:00.62, 2:50.33,14.78,18.15, 15.84= 51.54

**OHPLL**:  7.64, 5.57,7.59,4.76,6.32=6.93

That spread on [MU] lol. 




 Im a couple days late, but I want to add something and you might appreciate it. When you have a corner and bottom layer edge paired on the somewhere on the cube, some times the other corner is 1 or 2 moves away from being placed with this 2x1 block. So you end up with the 3x1x1 block and if you are used to cfop insertions, you will have to break it up. Or you can learn the 3 cases and solve an entire f2l block in a 7 move alg or so. That is just an example of the freedom of blockbuilding everyone else is talking about.  




 Oh ok, I understand. Sorry. 

On ebay canada I saw some Zhanchis for like 10-15 bucks, some moyu's for the same price. On auction you can save a couple bucks if you have the time. 

But yea, hit up the general discussion thread and Im sure a canadian can help you out more with cheaper cubes in canada. 









 Lmao M2 OH 




 Lol 100 in an hour (on the high end) is reasonable too. That would be insane.
