 By some measures, the population has been much better off in pre-capitalist societies. Many economic historians now admit that early factory workers experienced a sharp decline in living standards. And see this interesting abstract: http://ssh.dukejournals.org/content/28/2/211.abstract
As measured by height, the health of early Dark Age Europeans was better than that achieved by a century and a half of applying Adam Smith. I am reading Savage Continent, Keith Lowe's account of the tragedy of post-WW2 Europe, In it, he touches on an oft cited fact, that when wartime imposed food and health care rationing on capitalist Britain, "the general health of the population actually improved...". 
I suppose my point is that reality is more complex than what has been imagined by Karl Marx, Adam Smith or even Ayn Rand.  




 Edward Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud. Pioneered the use of psychology in advertising, public relations and propaganda. 




 A companion to this article was posted here today, The Trillion Dollar Oil Swindle, which asserts that the projected demand for crude oil has been consistently underreported, as part of a high level conspiracy to hold down its price and maintain the limping pace of the global economy. Considering that the current price is near or under the costs of new production (especially that from unconventional resources), and that most of the exporting nations need significantly higher prices to preserve their domestic tranquility, I at first doubted this presumed conspiracy could be maintained against such powerful interests. However, reflecting on the proposed deal with Iran, which will place more oil on the market and further depress its price, a high-level collusion makes more sense. Why else would Obama risk the ire of the Gulf States, Israel and fire-eating neo-conservatives, if it were not to delay another economic collapse? Here is another wild speculation: Falling oil prices are strong incentive for the Gulf States to intensify their current war with Iran.  




 Can capitalism thrive without its cronies? I suspect cronyism is an essential feature, not bug in capitalism. (Did I employ that meme correctly?) Seriously, this discussion has me placing Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation on my need-to-read list. 




 A clear illustration of how devastating even a low-tech, lower intensity-density civilization can devastate an ecosystem, and this rapid exhaustion of US forests for construction materials and fuel would spur the transition to iron and coal. Also pertinent to this discussion is the impact of Pre-Columbian civilizations on the forest cover of the Western hemisphere -- a popular account is the book 1491, by Charles C. Man. Two centuries before the migration of William Penn, that landscape is now thought to have been much less sylvan. Though the Amerindians were more thoughtful stewards of the land, from both by necessity and from belief, their impact on total biomass had to be considerable. We have the cautionary example of the Maya civilization and its collapse, but how sustainable were the woodland cultures of eastern North America? 




 Sorry. Attempts at brevity make my thoughts more arcane. What I suggest is while the democratic citizen is becoming irrelevant, the 'democratic consumer' is increasingly heeded by the corporate sector. Vote for whom or what you will, but your elected government hearkens to its corporate master's voice. In contrast, corporations are quick to react to the most marginal threat to their bottom line. What percentage of NASCAR enthusiasts are greatly offended by the display of the Confederate flag? The competitors that hope to be the presidential nominee of the GOP are reluctant to condemn Donald Trump's inflammatory statements on Mexican immigrants, but business partners are quick to dump him. The rulers of China understand that political stability is best achieved by catering to personal consumption, rather that enhancing civil rights or liberties. I hope this clarifies my thinking, such as it is.  




 Scientists estimate that the Earth contained approximately 1,000 billion tons of carbon in living biomass 2,000 years ago. Since that time, humans have reduced that amount by almost half. It is estimated that just over 10 percent of that biomass was destroyed in just the last century.

This implies that the majority of the biomass loss occurred prior to the 20th century, when the human population increased slowly from a few hundred million to two billion, with minimal energy derived from fossil fuels. If so, that is very alarming  even primitive horticulture, if practiced by hundreds of millions, is not sustainable. Does the full paper make a distinction between the losses due to human activity, and what might have been lost by natural cycles, e.g. the expansion of some of the worlds deserts?
Unlike economics, everything obeys the laws of thermodynamics; it is the most undeniable of the sciences. William S. Burroughs observed in his book, Naked Lunch: Thermodynamics has won at a crawl
