 Just send it son!  




 yay! Congratulations. Telling people about anxiety makes you feel amazing. Like your no longer carrying the burden alone. This is the beginning of improvement friend! You are on the path :)  




 They wanted a futuristic robot in a film so they...literally built a futuristic robot... 




 No but I will :) I'm glad I could give you some motivation however brief :) 




 Hey! That's awesome man I really wanna get good at it. As for feeling like you want to delete your comments, fuck that. Be proud of anything that you say. Don't regret it. Being an honest person is honorable and nothing to be ashamed of.  




 I'd read it! Also, writing doesn't even have to be a public thing. Sometimes I write just to myself to let it out. Feels a bit weird at first almost like you are incriminating yourself and you almost feel shy about writing your deepest darkest thoughts despite the fact that its only to yourself. But once you do, oh boy do improvements start happening. Once you can acknowledge and talk about your deepest fears in a casual manner and actually analyze them as mere thoughts you are literally making yourself more powerful by conquering your fears.  




 Fuck that man. You can do it. Its time you start making decisions to make yourself feel better. And talking about your problems no matter how bad you don't want to is the first step. 

Also, I see you like rubiks cubes. I solved my first 3 by 3 one the other day. Never felt so proud of myself :) 




 Thanks so much for opening up :) Its so good to talk about these things because now it isn't something stuck in your head for you only. You've shared it and now people who read your comment will know of your problem too so it feels less like something you've got pent up inside you as you've actually shared it. You say you are exhausted with being worried about things happening to your family. If it will give you any peace of mind, nothing bad is going to happen. You have to ask yourself, whats the point in being sad about what hasn't happened when you could be enjoying time with your family now? You need to practice being in the present as opposed to worrying about the future or thinking about the past. (Look up 'Mindfulness' by mark Williams) Relax about the exams, you will try your best and if you don't do well so be it. 

As for the OCD, I think it would really do you good to just pay a visit to a doctor or a psychiatrist. Don't do this on your own, people want to help and it feels so good to share the burden of anxiety by just talking about how you feel. It makes you feel 10x more normal. 

But above all. Seriously well done for sharing. Because before 10 minutes ago your problems existed solely in your mind but you've begun sorting shit out now by actually speaking about it and that is seriously something to be proud of. :)  




 Yay! Good job! :)  




 It's such a shame too because it shouldn't be something to have to do anonymously. Mental health is so serious and the fact that people can't open up to their families and loved ones but instead prefer to talk anonymously online really shows how backwards society has it at the moment. I really truly hope that in the future it will be something that people would bring up and talk about to their families like having a cold rather than having to hide it and talk to people they do not know for help. 

But at the same time, it's kinda beautiful that all these different people who are struggling from the same thing come together in a community wherein people completely open up and others actually care and respond despite not knowing them. :) makes me feel all warm and mushy inside :') 




 Are you kidding?! Every couple and every person has problems, some a lot deeper and more fucked up than yours! When feeling down its easy to look at others and assume they have it all figured out and everything is perfect but that's the point. You don't see their behind the scenes. Its completely normal to have problems. That's not to say its right or you should do it  but you shouldn't feel un-ordinary about it. Watch the film "American Beauty" if you haven't. Not only is it a great film but I feel it gives a good representation of a what goes on in seemingly "perfect" relationships or families.
