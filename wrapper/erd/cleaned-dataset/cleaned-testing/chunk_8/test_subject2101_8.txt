 its a shame we keep missing full-body pics of him at this event.  His shirt is tucked-in, and his pants are pulled up over his (assuming he has one) belly button.

 I know its not, but when most people say "early internet", they are referring to "early www".  In a context outside of text-only communications, I assume that you know this.  Many of us know this.

There is never a need to be a dick about it.  Many people think the "internet" and the "web" are the same thing.  In terms of common language, these days it pretty much is.  Get over it.

 Fantastic link explaining how they work. Thank you! 




 Thank you for asking this!!  I drive up/down CA and OR yearly and have always wondered about these. I'm never at a safe place to stop when I notice them, so I've never managed to get a picture. 

Thanks to everyone that has answered a question I have had for years now! 




 Aww, really?  Well, shit. 




 What did it say? 




 I'd put a current through it.  




 Plus kn0thing's and knotknot(sp?) initial an some ongoing responses were quite enflaming of the situation.

 I don't know if I would go with insecurity, but she continuously sets herself up to be a poster-child of sorts for the things she is trying to change/enforce regarding rules. 

People keep walking right into the trap.  




 That was fascinating. Thank you for sharing that. 




 Im totally being sarcastic.  /u/cATSup24 is just making a point about censorship. 




 Spoilers man!  I was gonna learn that eventually! 




 No need to make it a race war.  People can be assholes without being a racially motivated collective. 




 is what supposed to say redacted?  from /u/cATSup24's post? 




 Its been shown before via screenshots like yours that some negative Ellen Pao posts get removed. 




 If you want to ignore *what I said* and simply make up your own argument for you to solve, then congrats, you win todays interwebs. 




 1. Determine where you get the best antenna reception.
1. Analyze how you can achieve the cabling from your TV to that antenna placement.
1. Act upon your knowledge.  Determine a wiring route.  Measure twice, and buy (at least) a few feet more than (you think) you need.

For my current residence, I ran it under the living room rug, around the perimeter of the room.  Its a longer run, but it doesnt get stepped on or felt/seen in any way when walking through the area.

I also took the opportunity to run other advantageous wiring across the room under the rug.

At a previous residence I used a staple gun to tack the wiring around the wall baseboard, at the crease with the floor.  If you need ideas, Home Depot has tools and accessories for projects like this. 




 Wait a minute.  Are you suggesting that "admin" is synonymous with "administrator"? 




 Congrats. You still have a problem with English, but good for you for your google search.  




 They'd have to fly everyone to San Diego. 




 I said "probably".  If you consider the entirety of the united states and the listings of all ordinances online, my statement of "probably" is absolutely correct across the board.

So no, your google presponse of "probably" is statistically incorrect. 




 No, it probably wont.  Dumpster Diving laws are defined by local regulation.  Most municipalities do not post such ordinances online. 




 To change the name intentionally yet without purpose detracts from the origin. 




 It's AMAgeddon , not #TheDarkening 




 Can anyone recommend a game/server where characters have moral fortitude, stand up for what they believe in, and act as a unified team with their compatriots?

I've been a previous fan of Left4Dead for these reasons, but I'm looking for a larger group-play option.  And I'd really like to play on servers were the admin/mods listen to the players, and move forward with decisions that everyone wants - and not just what seems advantageous for attracting more future players.

Any recommendations would be appreciated, thanks!!! 




 /r/topgear has gone private/dark. 




 The issue actually is not about her getting fired.  The consequences of her being fired were the straw that broke the camels back for many mods that depended on her.

The underlying problem is admin/mod communications.  Many subs are not directly effected by this problem and operate autonomously.  But that doesn't mean that there isnt just cause to show solidarity.

I am an American.  This was dictated but not read.  My gf is Irish and I'm originally from Boston, so sometimes I actually give a crap about you fuckers. :-) 




 I think ending in time for EST morning traffic is a copout.  A proper protest would last 24 hours so that everyone world-wide is exposed to it accordingly. 




 Please mods, keep a handle on what is getting posted here for all that sweet sweet karma.  There is an increase in BS posts whose details have been proved false hours ago. 




 fake.  stop spreading rumor mill bullshit. 




 Well...  Whats better than reddit?  VOAT is just an alternative.  Right now there really isnt anything "better" than reddit. 




 You have got to be the biggest cocksmoker of the year.  Why the fuck are you instigating shit?  What the fuck is wrong with you? 




 the mods chickens 




 you no browse popular subreddits! 




 Please share this in higher profile subreddits, like /r/SubredditDrama.  Make sure this point gets added to the conversation regarding admin/mod communications. 




 Ahh, of course...  reports.  Like /user/KnotKnox has been shown to have, I'm sure she's getting tons of them.  Still surprised it can affect an admin-level user.

Thanks for the knowledge. 




 You're right.  Any idea on why automoderator would do this?  I didnt even consider this a possibility given the subreddit and the discussion. 




 CSS trickery.  Its not even gone dark. 




 ARE YOU *really* FUCKING SORRY?! 




 ~~Ellen Pao is deleting her posts:~~

~~https://np.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3byaei/reddit_alternatives_other_subs_going_private_to/csr0by6~~

She's not.  As \user\I_LOVE_HOOKERS pointed out below, her comments are visible under her profile.  




 Many of the default subs came back online before EST, because they are cowards. 




 Yes, please.  It doesn't contribute, and it only serves to trivialize the situation. 









 some of kk's recent posts really make me question if he is right for the job that some people are inferring he should get.

edit: grammar  




 Which makes me seriously wonder if there is some sort of ruse going on.  I mean, he knows how this shit works.  His replies regarding it are seriously fucking amature-hour. 




  AMAgeddon 




 no it didnt. 




 I'm talking about any serious "AMAgeddon" coverage coming from /r/news.  It doesn't really exist, and isn't at all necessary at this point.  That ship has sailed. 




 Oh, no kidding.  Its only the colored outer skin?  :-/ 




 This sub absolutely never ceases to amaze me with NGE-related content.  This, on top of a folk-ish/children'-ish song turned into a trance mix is just fucking incredible...

Original song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=36 v=eWM2joNb9NE

I LOVE YOU PEOPLE 




 Time to pull out some recipes that call for a lot of lemon zest! 




 All of this is incredibly late "news".  Its already being aptly covered by multiple subreddits that specialize in this sort of issue.

So, /r/news might as well show solidarity and go dark anyway.  There are lots of "news" sources outside of reddit.  Hit the admins where it hurts with your 5.9m subscriber stats. 




 This isnt a dig against foreign languages.  This is to stop gang-speak.

 :-D  no worries.  Just jumping on the V*******-related post bandwagon. 




 You do know what a double entendre is don't you? 














 This subreddit has (as far as I can tell) an active scanner that is collecting stats for subreddits that have gone private since "AMAgeddon" began.

 I've seen the responses.  I have been reading through related threads both present and past four 4+ hours now.  I didnt know who Ellen Pao was before today.  I previously could have cared less.  After today's events and what I have read: *I care.*

talking in comments isnt protesting - its discussing.  thats what we typically do on reddit: we discuss things.  protesting is taking action against something, and in this case the protest is using silence.  we cant protest in our discussions because, a) its useless, because b) we cannot interact in any meaningful way with the admins.

you obviously dont care about the issue at hand, and that's fine.  you don't have to be vested in this, or care what direction the site is going in.  and I dont mean that in a sarcastic or demeaning manner.  reddit, like many sites, is a tool.  Use or care for the tool how you want.

If you dont care, then dont complain about it. 




 They seem to be quite on-board with all the privateering.  /r/Portugal is also.  My favorite translated quote from there is:

 hoje  dia de cozido caralho! onde  que vou comer agora?

Which translates roughly to, *"today is cooked ass! where am I going to eat now?"*
 




 You are typing a lot here, but you are missing a lot of research.  A lot of "mods" (particularly non-active or non-default mods) dont have a real understanding of what is going on. 

No one is screaming.  This is a silent protest against months of admin/mod improprieties.   




 Watching NGE for the first time is kinda like taking a hallucinogenic drug (acid, ecstasy, etc).  You really should do it with an experienced friend. 




 You could try better rice.  Minute rice is craptastic imho - but, I might be a bit of a rice snob.  Different rices add different flavor nuances as well as textures.

My go-to rice is Nishiki.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy a proper rice cooker. 




 The wikipedia article that OP linked to has instructional links. 




 you submitted this same image (2) days ago.  wtf. 




 its a good thing that pic was [re]posted here, because /r/funny is private right now. 




 because shaming fat people can get you shadowbanned/fired/reddit-roulette-wheeled 









 Jesus Christ, learn how to spell ***Reich!***

 Its not about her.  Its about how the loss of her position was handled.  There is a lot of mod-related procedure that was broken because of her sudden departure.

This was the proverbial *straw that broke the camels back* in terms of mod/admin relations. 




 Nice watermark.  Couldn't get your blackness from a reputable source? 




 when I was still learning to speak, I called trucks, "fucks". 




 I love it when multiple redditors see the same tragic events! 




 Apparently reddit cant deduce sarcasm from phrasing anymore.  You gotta end everything with a "/s" to make it perfectly clear or people will waa on you. 




 They aren't oranges.  They are ***tang***erines.  









 Well, how do you say it?  dah-rums? 




 holy crap.  I'm exhausted just from watching that. 




 but the subs going dark isnt about Victoria specifically, but the very poor admin/moderator relations since Pao took power at reddit. 




 Its the law.  And it has to be illuminated in case of a power outage. 




 You no browse subreddits! 




 yay marriage equality! 




 I think that solidarity in going dark for the issues that you speak to would speak volumes more to the reddit admins than this message ever so elegantly does. 




 That's what this /r/SubredditDrama and /r/OutOfTheLoop are for.  It makes people involved by having to figure out just wtf is happening.  It engages discovery. 




 Dont know off-hand, but its referenced in the /r/OutOfTheLoop discussion. 




 Yes.  Please.  And, thank you.

 Dont downvote this.  This is just a link to a version of this page that doesnt hide the downvote button with CSS.  




 I HAVE BEEN D.ARK.ENED WITH DISSAPOINT. 




 After reading many of the posts here and in other subs on reddit regarding this, and other recent admin grievances; I'm beginning to think maybe someone at reddit got the wrong take-away message from season 3 of Orange Is The New Black. 




 Why is it that I don't believe you?   




 How much hurt would it be to "our users" for a day's worth of dissent?  I'm a bit disappointed in the PC Master Race on this day... 




 Thats really not what I was implying, but phrasing I guess... 




  I personally feel like shutting /r/science down as well, that's how much of a bad taste this leaves.


Please do.  [Solidarity is usually required to send an effective message](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/We_Can_Do_It%21.jpg/800px-We_Can_Do_It%21.jpg).

 Not kind of; It *is* cheating in terms of "perfect loops". 




 Please, someone local to Chicago, please start a local/grassroot outcry to your local BS.  Only standing united can crap like this be stopped before it starts. 




 Aziz!  Light! 




 OP.  I highly recommend you acquire a higher resolution scan of that photo.  No one can do anything with the image you posted. 




 I was just being facetious.  I know that "hunting" comes in many forms. 




 10/10 would still choke 




 It was until they figured-out way to monetize.  




  Too similar

Really?  Does it have to be something "different"?  Why cant it be like what we have now, but without the changes that we dont like?  Wouldn't we want to stay if these things weren't taking place? 




 This is all seems so suspicious sounding. All of this, just because an issue with Victoria?

I mean, even if you got rid of a single specific person for whatever reason; why would you 'private' a top-level subreddit?  I would think that there are so many other things you could do before resorting to this move unless the entire mod team is imploding in there. 




 So, did your boss try to talk you down on the price?
