 Yes. 




 Just in case anyone's wondering, this is from a horror manga called [Glyceride](http://openawesome.com/junji-ito-horror-manga/glyceride.html) by Junji Ito. 









 I think that this is just this sub in general. 




 I mean this: http://www.clker.com/cliparts/6/S/W/2/g/t/transparent-red-no-circle-hi.png 




 This is what the Nazi's fought to prevent. 




 Fallout: New Vegas. It's worth checking out, especially since Fallout 4 is coming out soon. 




 I think it says in the starting screen that the only reason they survived was because of how isolated many of the reservations are, as well as the fact that  they preserved some of their old traditions which translated to survival on the continent now that it's more like pre-columbian north america than it is today. 




 That sounds like something an *SJW* would say...  




 Wait... There are people down there!?!?! 




 What mod is this? Sorry I don't really play many but this doesn't look like the vanilla game to me. 




 This is all heresy.

 I'm not sure, maybe whenever they're raised by an orthodox ruler it counts as at war, but for some reason I didn't have the option to vassalise them. 




 Expel the holy sphelcure or whatever it's called. This messed me up in my Rome game and is super annoying, as that holy order always takes baronies and makes me wonder why some things aren't working. 




 You're already dead, Omae wa mou shindeiru. 




 Our future folks. 




 Signed, totally not the police. 




 That second guy looks like quite the euphoric gentlesir 




 People like this would have been locked up in an asylum a while ago. And rightly so might I add. 




 Funny how these people are only allowed to say these things by the free speech that the USA upholds. 




 Ahh, the joys of Capitalism 




 I think OP may be the teen in the video and he's trying to tell us what ended up happening. 




 revolt risk -1.0% 




 Whenever I'm down or sad or feeling apathetic I just come to this sub and look at this one image. It always makes me feel better. 




 I think decadence revolts are event-spawn, hence no attrition. 




 Despite the fact that we can all agree that the Liberal  garbage propaganda fed to college students is disgusting and should stop. The ethicacy of manipulating someones political views are shaky at best. Remember, we should strive to be better our enemies, not be on the same level as or worse than. 




 I'm not sure of the event ID's but the event that tells you it's going to occur soon happened to me in the late 2800's and the actual even happened in that same time period. 




 I fired the event and it gave me a window saying "you're not supposed to see this" I selected the only option and I got the window saying the election was over with a random lowborn receiving over 2000 votes and he was the only candidate. I took this to be a glitch and killed him with console, upon his death the elections began again and they went through without a hitch with me being elected.

Thanks for the help. I feel really appreciative that someone on the mod team would help me troubleshoot this. 




 Thanks. I'll try this out tomorrow when I get the opportunity and see if it works. 




 I'm not sure if any other candidates died or not. But the odd thing is I've played for a bit more at this point and its been a good 20-25 years since our last president. I noticed the "election season nears a close" event thing hasn't fired yet. Is there any way I could get it to fire manually via console? 




 So I'm playing as an Americanist character in the 'After the End' mod and I control what is pretty much the largest realm in the game. Other than some characters down in Florida I also control all Americanist characters and provinces. So, the president of the USA died a few years ago and since then I have been campaigning the become the next president. I have the overwhelming majority of votes, with over 1000 whereas my closest competitor only has 80-ish. But the problem is that the election has been running for the past 5 years. I tried restarting my game twice and it didn't fix the glitch. My best guess is that it hasn't triggered the 'elections nearly over' event yet, so it hasn't ended the elections.

Anyone got any ideas to fix this? 




 You only have one problem. You're not Americanist.

All hail the founding fathers. 




 Me fail English? That's unpossible! 




 Me fail english? Thats unpossible! 




 we always need more boosters! 









 Weird, I was listening to some music by Sabaton when I saw this. I didn't know they had a game and I'll be sure to check it out! 




 And damn these pagans are powerful. 




 Well, it's not tough when you have the Roman Empire's borders reclaimed and a 100K deathstack, but imagine facing them when Europe is extremely fractured and you only control a relatively small plot of land. Yeah, a lot tougher.
