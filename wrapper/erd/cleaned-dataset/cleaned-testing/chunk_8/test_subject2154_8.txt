 Melvin had warning signs for like 2 seasons before he completely fell off the cliff though 




 You're just doing a Chris Carter impersonation aren't you 




 Did you not see [this](http://grantland.com/the-triangle/2015-mlb-detroit-tigers-defensive-improvement-nick-castellanos/)? He may not be as good as you hoped but he's clearly working at it. 




 Whoops, thank you! 









 Wow that's actually really really cool. And we all get a great game out of it to boot. 




 Let me go through point by point:

 There has [sic] been little to no rumblings regarding Sosh since the 02 run

Wrong. He was on the hot seat as recently as last year. Then he went and led the team to 98 wins and that talk died out.

 The tenure of players like Blanton   Frieri

Both of whom were in the positions they were in largely due to a lack of organizational options. Frieri was good for awhile here, and people hailed him as the bullpen savior. Then he went sour, and naturally people wanted him out. Sosh would've put someone else out there if he'd had good options. He didn't, so out Frieri went again.

Blanton was the same way. You really think Sosh would've kept running him out there if he had other options? He absolutely did not have other options. Blanton was worth trying, solely because the alternatives were just as miserable.

 the absolute stop light to the running game

One thing Sosh does not get nearly enough credit for is managing to his current roster. Sosh likes to run, it's well-documented. You know why he doesn't run with this squad? Because it's not a team that's equipped to run. Trout is the only guy with plus speed, and thus is the only guy who steals bags. You really want him sending guys like Aybar, who is not a good base stealer, just to say he has the running game going? No, you'd complain about how he sends runners when he shouldn't, and how that's a good reason for him to be fired.

Sosh teaches base running very well; his teams' track record will prove that. This just happens to be probably the worst running team he's ever managed. And we still go 1st to 3rd and score on sac flies quite well, given how slow our team is.

 A Yankees payroll of players

Take that up with Tony Reagins and Arte. Those two are directly responsible for every huge deal we've thrown at someone during Sosh's tenure with the exception of Trout (whose deal I hope you don't take exception with or I'm wasting my time here completely)

 He's the longest tenured manager in baseball   his team's [sic] have regularly fallen short of expectations for 10 straight years

Wrong. Wrong wrong wrong. Last year's team was not even on anyone's radar as best team in baseball. Most people had us out of the playoffs. We've had a huge amount of success under Sosh. The only stretch that can be construed as otherwise is the 5 years between 2009 and 2014 where we missed the playoffs, and that was largely due to an extremely competitive AL West, transitioning between core groups of players, and some really bad contracts that hampered our flexibility. 

The thing managers should get credit for, above all else, is maintaining clubhouse morale and cohesiveness, as well as managing playing time and the pitching staff without egregious errors. Sosh has done this to a T since he's been here. Whenever he's had a bullpen to work with, he's used it like a scapel. I'm stoked we have him as our manager. There's a reason he's the longest tenured skipper in the bigs, and has been around longer than all the managers in the AL Central combined. But hey, if you want to end a good thing, by all means. Call for his head. 




 yes yes yes yes yes! 




 These things happen, no worries man 




 For sure, doesn't come off as sarcasm in the initial post. All good my friend 




 The Reds' call was posted a bit further down. I assumed the post I responded to was referring to the video in the title post, which is indeed the Tigers' call. 




 It crosses state lines. Not sure if you knew this, but Houston is in Texas. 




 I wouldn't say they have been at any staggering rate. Nothing Sosh is doing this season is staggeringly bad; the team's just scuffling, so people want a scapegoat. Call it what it is: people want to bitch when we lose. 




 How does Indiewire hire? Who are you guys reading?  




 I wish we could get one for the ALW but everyone hates the Angels anyway. Not to mention the Angels sub is pretty toxic as it is. 




 It's confirmation bias at its most elemental and basic, but okay. 




 Yes, you knew right away that he would GIDP. Thank you, oh high and mighty mind reader. 




 Well it was the Tigers' station. 




 Reds 




 He's been working on his arm strength for over a year now, and it's showing up big time. Last night before our game, he threw a ball from the left field foul line over the fence in right field, which is 15 feet tall in Anaheim. He had a game-saving outfield assist against Colorado earlier this year. He's getting better. 




 That's why I said claim to influence, not legitimate influence. Although a lot of those problems could be solved by getting involved with their union. 




 Notice I said claim; the actual legitimacy of that power is a lot dicier. However, there's an argument to be made, whereas the Koch brothers are just rich dudes whose money buys them wanton influence. 




 Nazca Grill is pretty good, off of Genesee. 




 I would imagine it has something to do with unions being made up of lots of people, and thus having a better claim to wielding a large influence. Whereas the Koch brothers are two dudes, and only claim to represent their own interest.

Basically, the unions' level of influence is based upon their large memberships, so they can claim to speak for a lot of people; the Kochs speak only for themselves, but have a wildly disproportionate amount of influence for being only 2 people.

 




 Game just wouldn't have changed. Eshelman wasn't giving up a run, and he wasn't coming out of the game. We'd have won.

That being said, it's not what happened. 




 **This Is Water** by Jess Walter. Contemporary, funny, really good. He strikes a tough-to-achieve balance between readable and literary for contemporary fiction.

**Brief Interviews With Hideous Men** by David Foster Wallace. A fantastic look at sex and love and commitment. Probably the only book of his (other than Everything and More, which isn't nearly as widely read) that really focuses in on one grouping of themes. **Oblivion** is also fantastic. 




 Mariners 




 I love Todd Frazier, so good to see him raking. He just seems like a great guy 




 His foot feels better than it ever has since he got to Anaheim, and he's crushing the ball as a result. 




 Kole is a great leadoff guy. Easily the best leadoff player on our roster right now.

The question is, can we afford to spare him and put him elsewhere. 




 Had a bad feeling about our chances as soon as the weather delay knocked Esh out. We acquitted ourselves well, but just don't have the firepower. I'm sad. 




 Well, I was at Dave Roberts only game ever as manager I guess\

EDIT: obviously he might/almost for sure will get a chance at a permanent manager's gig at some point. 




 Who you calling pal, friend 




  I'm not sure I would call their basketball program excellent

 Well for starters a program generally includes many different sports, not just basketball

Stop talking out of your ass haha

 




 San Diego has gorgeous weather, but it's cloudy every once in a while 




 Yes, were it not for the rainout it's hard to imagine Vandy getting this one, but give them some credit. Peitzmeier left the ball up in the 9th and they hammered it every time. 




 Clutch isn't a thing, statistically. We had extraordinarily bad luck. 




 More delays, starting at 2 local time now.

Gotta favor Vandy to get Eshelman out of there with a 3 run lead. 




 As a counterpoint to some of the people ITT claiming suicide is selfish and unforgiveable: 

People pontificate, "Suicide is selfishness." Career churchmen like Pater go a step further and call in a cowardly assault on the living. Oafs argue this specious line for varying reason: to evade fingers of blame, to impress one's audience with one's mental fiber, to vent anger, or just because one lacks the necessary suffering to sympathize. Cowardice is nothing to do with it - suicide takes considerable courage. Japanese have the right idea. No, what's selfish is to demand another to endure an intolerable existence, just to spare families, friends, and enemies a bit of soul-searching.

-David Mitchell, *Cloud Atlas*  




 That's the spirit 




 You gotta get through the first 100, then it really picks up 




 Can we all just admit that covering NFL receivers and hitting MLB pitching are both incredibly hard things to do, and that you would likely have very little success at either if you had not worked at it for a long time?

Jeez. 




 Not gonna lie, I laughed 




 More like we picked a hell of a time to go 1 for 22 with RISP haha, but whatever floats your boat

EDIT: Thanks for the downvotes, they were super clutch 




 I appreciate what you're trying to say here, but it's the attitude of a person who hasn't felt those flames. I'm not saying it can't be beaten, but the power of mental illness is that it denies context. It's incredibly difficult to overcome without help, and its power is that it feels insurmountable in the most immediate and direct way possible. 




  The Angels have not been in the playoffs since signing Pujols. 

We had the best record in baseball last year.. 




 Middle of the infield has more ground to cover, so it's considered more demanding than the corners. As a result, they get more balls hit their way, or into areas where they're the one who needs to make the play.

2B is considered easier than SS largely because of the arm question. The throw is much shorter, so you have more time to throw and you don't need as strong of an arm to be able to record outs.

Basically, shortstops need both a strong arm (for the longer throw, like the 3B) and a greater range (because they have more ground to cover, like the 2B) 




 I do 




 Balls and strikes, and whether or not a fielder touched second while turning a double play. 




 20 HR power is a big deal, especially out of a catcher. Just saying. 




 He's not moving to pitcher.. 




 In defense of the pick: from what I understand, the teams were a lot higher on Ward than the draft experts were. The Angels draft room was celebrating because they were actually not expecting him to be available when we drafted.

Welcome Taylor, best of luck! 




 Not disagreeing with anything you're saying other than that the call was confirmed, not upheld, which means they saw something on the video that made them think the call was correct, not that they didn't have enough evidence to overturn it. Hell, I don't know what evidence that was, but that was the ruling.. 




 He'll hit some if it's innings-based. At that point it's more of an incentive for not getting hurt than any performance though. But he will get less opportunities if he sucks, and that will make it hard to hit any incentive, even if it's just appearances or innings pitched. 




 Still, incentives are performance-based. If he doesn't perform well, he will not receive most of that money, unless the Cubs suck at writing incentive clauses. 




 He's not getting incentives if he sucks. 




 I think people mostly say it because he comes off as kinda douchey sometimes. The only effect it has on his game is what you're saying, sometimes he commits silly fouls out of emotion. 




 *King Solomon's Mines* is a classic that seems to fit what you're looking for. *Two Years Before the Mast* is also great, although maybe a little outside your specified range. 




 Coming out July 31st! 




 Basically this. The foot changed him as a player. He's still a very good one, just not the guy we got used to. 




 100% on board with this. That's why Texas is scaring me right now. 




 Yes! This would be awesome. 




 Whoa, never knew that was a slur. Good to have that knowledge to avoid accidents. 




 Studs Terkel's work should be much more widely read.

I'm also a big fan of *The Boys of Summer* by Roger Kahn. Such an interesting piece of retrospection. 




 2002 was a great series though. And let us have just this one thing :( you have three newer shinies to play with. 




 Why is our organization run by shitheads. 




 Beautiful Ruins by Jess Walter deals a lot with the film world, and also happens to be one of my favorites. A great book. 




 Any Joseph Campbell should be pretty interesting to you. Edith Hamilton's *Mythology* is also a classic. 




 The comments made by the agent make it seem like Hornacek was contacted directly, which isn't allowed and thus forced Hornacek to refuse the request or be in violation of his contract. 

Which would make sense with a lot of what people are saying about Pollard liking Otz and not wanting to do a real coaching search. He may have torpedoed his chances with Hornacek on purpose. 




 The western US before it was urbanized. Seeing the Sierras, the Pacific Northwest, the Grand Canyon, the Rockies, before cars and pollution and overcrowding and hunting and dams...would've been incredible. 




 We're also last in the majors in BABIP. The team as constructed is going to be given a little more time to work it out before any major tweaks will be made I think, unless a good deal comes along. I have faith in JeDi making the right move. 




 A healthy Miggy might have beat him again, which is where I disagree that Miggy should've beat him in the first place. But without Miggy, it's not even an argument. Just because it was Trout's weakest year doesn't mean he wasn't the MVP. 




  Bryce Harper will end up being a much better player than Mike Trout, who won't win another MVP

I disagree with you, but respectfully. You're not right, and you're not wrong either

 Michael Brantley should have beaten him last year

Aaaand some opinions are unpopular because they are flat out wrong, like claiming the Moon landing never happened. 




 I only hate him cuz of 2005 




 I am honestly happy that Galarraga's perfect game got taken away on a blown call. 

To me, Galarraga threw a perfect game. Everywhere except the record books will acknowledge that (and I guess some weird sticklers for technicality).

But the grace and forgiveness that Galarraga showed to Joyce, a man who clearly felt terrible about an honest mistake, was incredible, one of the noblest things I've seen. It gives me tears to think about, and it's the kind of thing I want to be able to show my kids as an example one day. One of the best moments of humanity in a game full of them. Galarraga has my utmost respect forever, because of how he conducted himself in that situation. 




 They did have flat bats way back when. The bats splintered on contact with baseballs, they realized it was dangerous, and they switched away. 




 He really does, his enthusiasm is contagious

Flip side of that is that of course he's having fun given how good he is, but still. 




 Glad I can pay it forward! I went to Fenway for the first time last Sunday when the Angels were there, and despite the fact that we lost, I had an incredible time. Great ballpark, and the fans went out of their way to be friendly and considerate and engage in good-natured banter while simultaneously talking about how good Trout was and all that..seriously made the experience even better, blew me away. So thank you! 




 You guys are the same number of games out of first as we are. You have ample opportunity to turn it around. 




 Trout's face in that is great too haha 




 I feel the same way, I legitimately like most of our division, just not when we're playing you guys 




 :) 




 Yeah I'm not mad about this at all. I want Josh to have success, and this made me grin like crazy at work 




 It's always quiet. But we got you :) 




 Please do! 




 I don't think you'll regret it!

Let me clarify though, it doesn't explicitly deal with death. It centers on an old man whose life is clearly winding down, and the existential questions that come into play with that. It got me thinking about death, but more accurately it's about the end of life (in part; there are other things at work obviously. It's a fantastic piece of literature). 




 *Disgrace* by JM Coetzee is a haunting look at a life winding down. Wouldn't recommend it if you're not ready to wrestle with the themes though. But if you're willing to go there, it's great. 




 That sounds awesome, will do! 




 This exceeds even my absurdly high expectations and now I know I need to see it. I'm even more pumped to go someday now. 




 Cowgill is our current tenured ex-Met, Kirk's gotta earn it. 




 Also, how cool were the High School Championships? From everything I've read, it's a bucket list event for me. Is it hard to get tickets? What's the atmosphere around it like? 




 What's the biggest difference in the culture of the game there? Let's split hairs too: biggest on-field/gameplay cultural difference and biggest difference in the surrounding culture (front offices, fans, stadiums, anything).
