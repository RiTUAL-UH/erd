 That makes her a boer more then likely not african. 




 Seriously? 




 I see 3 different ethnic groups in this competition alone.  




 Yes idiot. That's the general consensus of how land claims are established, in part it's longevity and simply living there that enshrines this. The natives also settled the majority of america, look up their early civilization before small pox and other diseases arrived with the new world, the native's we know are the result of what a Apocalypse would look like after 90% of their population died off. It's said all the trees and forest that sprouted up due to the loss off life created created a mini ice age in north america. 




 I was expecting more asians. 




 You would be forced to do the same with your kids. 




 Were sorry we got one group of racist mistaken for another group of nazi racist our bad le redditors.  




 r conspiracy theories fuck off. 




 That actually sounds like a pretty fun time for a kid in the 80's without access to cocaine. What was your reaction when the public became aware of hackers/phreakers in the authorities started to crack down on your activities and you started to enter the pop culture lexicon?

 Funner fact. Heels were specifically invented for mounted warriors, such as mongols, Scythian's,huns hard to imagine but Genghis khan in stiletto's would of been killing it..... literally.  




 also what ever happened to prince stennis if we spared his miserable life? 




 Molly? yeah she was a cutie. I also would not mind taking foltest sloppy seconds,  Mary Louisa La Valette she owes me for not killing her pretentious son and you know saving her kids, oh in freeing her from the dungeon.  




 Outside mcu and dcu? or w.e they call their master stroke to beat marvel cinema wise. 




 Prometheus gave us fire not charon.  




 Yeah my first comment on here i pointed it out on the exact name you guys went by, BTW when were you a phreaker? during the 70's or 90's? 




 Do people get off on correcting grammatical errors? i know.  




 Hack reddit in change it for me could ya? 




 Aww my one true love, fuck yen and triss it's about that trolggish ruggish love. 




 This^ god it was so out of character to turn her down. That twin threesome would of happened in the first ten seconds of our encounter in witcher one with those practice swords being used for another kind of sword play. 




 No Mr woody Allen, after all it's not like she's your actual daughter or anything. BTW i love all your films playing the proverbial pathetic older Jewish stereotype. 

Ha but nah wincest on a technicality.  




 I'm disturbed on so many levels but also intrigued.... 




 For me it's the master-craftsman nord yoana followed by a close second being the herbalist we met in white run with the tight pants oomph.  




 The kids in question bypassed pre-installed software to stop them from changing their desktop, somebody on here stated that's not hacking when that's the basis of hacking really. Getting around and accessing something you were never intended to is most definitely hacking, allot of people have a preconceived notion of what hacking is, that's why i posted the link to show people the various forms of hacking that have existed for decades originally starting with telecommunications in continuing into the data age with computers. Oh in steve wozniak was a phreaker.  




 Exactly, i used to date a british chick, when she moved back to London we tried to keep it going. Even today international long distance calls are a bitch when it comes to the rates, i don't know if they changed it but if you did not have a plan that included it they would charge a dollar per minute in we would spend hours on the phone.  




 Using nothing more then sound these guys could hack long distance calls, which in the 70's/80's was a huge thing, it would be the equivalent of unlimited minutes/texting back in the early 2,000's without paying a goddamn cent. 


The most well known hackers include Steve Wozniak, co-founder of apple, john draper or better known as captain crunch the man who inspired Wozniak and Steve jobs to start up a black market business. here's an article on some of the greatest early hackers including a blind guy with perfect note recognition, might as well consider him the daredevil of phreaking.

 It's kind of funny that some people don't consider this hacking, you should look up the early day's of hacking going back to the 70's when people would use stuff like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking

using nothing more then sound these guys could hack long distance calls, which in the 70's/80's was a huge thing, it would be the equivalent of unlimited minutes/texting back in the early 2,000's without paying a goddamn cent. Man hacking goes way back, we think of it as computers and crazy tech geeks deciphering some computer code in then using it to rob people's data from a bogus ip address listed in the Caribbean but it is so much more. 




 Isn't that the definition of hacking? bypassing preinstalled software,programs and other security measures to do something that the developers had never intended? 




 Iranian. Let me become a mod on that subreddit puleasse:) 









 Number one, i'm a Zionist and we're not oppressing anybody. How do i know this? because i actually do research. My information is not based on fb post and twitter messages with a picture of a kid blown in two that is later discovered to actually be a syrian. I can go into the fact that 20% of israel is arab, a third of the israeli government is made up of arab israeli political parties, a supreme court justice is arab and the various things that israel does for Palestinian arabs like you know make sure they don't starve to death by providing truck load of food to Gaza, allowing the wife of abbas in for medical treatment or the granddaughter of the pm of hamas but i'm not because you would not even listen.

You don't know any facts about the situation, if i told you west bank and gazan's were obese fat assholes who place in the top ten most obese people in the world you would not believe me, if i told you president abbas of the pa authority has a hundred million net-worth and the leader of hamas is a billionaire who lives in opulence in qatar now turkey you would never believe me. Because you don't think you don't research. I do. I had a Palestinian teacher in highschool who gave me the same crap about oppression and planes versus rocks then guess what? i read a book. I read a book about american history in i learned history is not one sided, i learned about the messed and utter bullshit we did that our history book's omit in i learned to read between the lines in do my own research.

That's how i learned that the palestenians aka arabs suffer because of their own stupidity, that's how i learned why israel is blockading gaza and why the world seems so content to allow the new "nazi's" aka israel do this in guess what it's not because the jews control congress (but it's cute that the entire pal narrative relies on blood libel to convince the always anti-semitic euro's to hate the jews even more) it's because israel is a secular democracy, it's because israel is the only country in a region full of arab nation's that provides more rights to Arabs then even arab countries provide to their own citizens in sometimes this is to the detriment of the jewish israeli's especially when one pal arab who got a free college degree while in prison for stabbing a jewish kid gets out in becomes a bomb maker for hamas or coordinates more "resistance" attacks by targeting kindergartens. 

Fun fact look up how many Palestinian leaders (like those who founded bds) studied free of charge in israeli universities, how many got degrees even after being convicted of terror charges and look what they did with it. They immediately go in yell death to israel, when you say palestine what you're referring to is the british mandate that ended in 47-48 with the full recognition by the un of israeli independence and the creation of jordan/israel the results of the former mandate, the arab state of palestine never came to be because the arabs refused.

But you won't read this because you think that a made for tv media propaganda campaign devised by the arab world to help affiliate the destruction of the jewish statehood(theirs a reason why they wave flags declaring all of "palestine" over israel) you're the sap. Btw you're correct isis exist because we invaded, kicked out saddam and disbanded the majority sunni iraqi army, our bad, were sorry next time we should leave a brutal dictatorship in place, that's the messed up part about the region, their so f-ed up their only reasonable leadership is theocracy,dictatorship or terrorist groups. 




 Yeah this is bullshit. 




 Read bro, just read. Look up some of catherine the greats exploits, she was a classic hoe who use it to her advantage to court favor repeatedly. Or go to /r/history in ask about it. Kim kardashian became famous for a sextape actually, Marilyn monroe was a notorious hoe and she was still famous, you objectively stated sluts would not be put on a pedestal yet they were. This woman also had repeated affairs(op states this check his comment history) you really that naive to believe she is not sucking a dick here and there, bro we all see beautiful women, but here's the reality, what is your type may not be my type, i can believe a celeb getting preferential treatment, but if we're basing this off looks only that's bullshit. Yes pretty women, pretty people in general are treated differently, that's just life, but you really believe in most instances theirs a woman beautiful enough that she can away with half the shit op states?

I believe op but only if she is charismatic, beautiful and a local celeb that make's sense but if you're arguing from oh she's pretty she can get anything is bull because not all men have the same outlook on beauty, i have seen women that i have found stunning get looks by 90% of men but theirs always one guy who is oblivious that's just factual otherwise porn would not be so varied, different taste for different people. Also men we're bloody dense son's of bitches, not every guy would even get the hint of flirting in actuality.

Btw if op's mom is a blond i would kick her out of bed because i don't like blonds see how that works. In also that's a club/restaurant all guys are trying to get pussy in that instance, you think all dudes 24/7 are even noticing her? that's just ignorance. Yeah a guy will blow a couple of bills in a club to get a number or 3 well hopefully, but you really think he's going to do it constantly for the same chick when he knows he is not getting anything? puhlease. 




 Same concept applies. People put sluts on pedestals all the time, just look at kim kardashian,Marilyn monroe, they're plenty of recent and historical sluts we have turned into american icons.
