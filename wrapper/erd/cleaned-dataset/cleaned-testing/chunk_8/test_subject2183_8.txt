 Quintessential example of a basement fag.

 If the couch is in the same room as you and it's a full moon when it's dark you must leave straight away. 




 Slow down and don't rush things. One step at a time. THik about what you want first and get it. 




 Start slow and build habits, walk 20 minutes  day and jog 5 minutes a day 




 If it works then use it,  even if it sometimes isn't strictly logical.

 I''m upvoting everything 




 What doesn't kill me makes me stronger, except for chronic pain leading to sensitization 




 I live like there is no tomorrow because there is none

Yeah I realized that all of life is my responsibility, i'm the boss. It's just a dreadful nagging persistent feeling that disturbs me. The excitement of life and it's possibility makes up for it though.

 Rule of thumb in investing is that a folio is diversified, probably half of your savings should go to your main investment; within this context dogecoin

 Sounds good, once the value goes up I simply convert it back and buy more bitcoins. 




 Interesting, i've had a look but it seems like they have all dead links at the moment

 No it was a special deal from the ISP and cancellation has a hefty fee.

 My favourite nietzsche quote 




 I always used to tell myself that the more pain i'll experience in life the stronger i'll get, I guess i'll be able to handle it better but regardless it's pretty scary that pain receptors become more sensitive, not to be pessimistic but my years of old age won't be fun 














 I like how far he went to help us avoid nihilism and embrace existentialism 




 You have to do an AMA now 




 That might be it but I can't find where I can watch it online

 It's a contemplation and yes I want to see if anyone else can relate to my dramatic shift from a life where I am a scared nobody to a sudden wise confident leader in a matter of socializing for a few hours. 




 Being intelligent is a good indicator that they are interesting as a rule of thumb but primarily a girl that is on my level, she is not pretending to be out of my league or not submissive, i can't stand it when they are submissive, but a girl that is close, a girl that challenges me and makes me persevere through obstacles in life and grow as a person an intelligent girl would pretty much fit that as living a life together would pose the usual challengs ofcourse.

A person, when face to face isn't trying to impress you or control insecurity or isn't trying to act superior to be "hard to get" but is with you because SHE wants to be with YOU and YOU want to be right there with HER that kind of love is genuine love. TO THOSE READING THIS AGAIN MAKE SURE YOU ARE READING IN CONTEXT, DON"T MISTAKE THIS FOR ME BEING PICKY OR AN OVERTHINKER, LIFE GETS BETTER WITH EXPERIENCE AND PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO DO GREAT THINGS WITHOUT KNOWING WHY, WITHOUT PLANNING AND OVER-ANALYSIS THINGS FLOW SO LIVE LIFE AND DON"T SIT THERE THINKING TOO MUCH OR WORRYING TOo MUCH THE KEY IS TO **DO** THINGS

 *If LSD is like being strapped to rocket, learning to meditate is like gently raising a sail. - Sam Harris, Neuroscientist and New York Times best seller*

I can certainly say that after two years of meditation I can reach a state where life feels nice; I feel happy as if I am a complete person and I don't need anything that society or the media tell me I need. It feels like all I need is that state of mind and that my happiness is guaranteed. I am no longer a beta, insecure, half lost sheep.

 



















 It looked like she was holding back laughter 




 I got the exact same feeling, like as if it's the laugh of shame like a human is not worthy and needs to be naturally-selected out 




 Sick of your shit johny

 My opinion from an existential standpoint:

Be warned that what is written below is very colloquial and is poorly focused on the structure that calculating and strictly logical people are used to, I refer not to the link underneath but everything after this sentence.

http://www.philosophybro.com/2010/12/nietzsches-thus-spoke-zarathustra.html[1]

After reading this and spending a lot of time with interpretations of nietzsche and satre as well as reading their well known books the idea hit me like a drop of water on my forehead.

The kind of freedom nietzsche was talking about can be understood by first looking at this statement.

"You **know** what happiness is" that's fucking right, don't consult the internet, or a friend or analyse a successful person and find out what next good decision etc etc. No YOU decide. When leaving behind religion and embracing doubt, embracing science we still don't have the kind of freedom neitzsche had in mind. This is because we doubt ourselves in the same way that we now doubt the religion we discarded, we need to consult science before making a decision as if it's the boss.

You are the fucking boss. "Don't be so egocentric?" Fuck off. You call the shots, you roll the dice, you decide when you are happy, you decide what will make you happy, you are a free spirit and therefore you have the power.
