I have yet to hear a Seven Lions remix that I don't like better than the original! 




 Hi!  I'm a Master's student studying marine mammals so hopefully I can help you out a bit.

The first thing I would say is to figure out generally what you are interested in by reading as many papers as possible.   My senior year of undergrad I had no idea what I was interested in (other than doing SOMETHING with marine mammals) and going through the literature helped me narrow it down to a few different research interests.  You're going to be thinking about one project 24/7 for years so you need to make sure you like it (or at least not want to pull all your hair out over it)!

As you're going along and reading papers on topics you think are neat, you'll probably notice the same authors showing up again and again.  You should look up the CVs of these researchers and see where they are/if they take on graduate students.  To be honest, people will not care which grad school you went to - they will care about who you know and who you've worked with.  Marine mammals is such a competitive field and 90-100% of your success in it will come through your ability to network.

So, once you have a list of potential advisors, email them!  Ask what they are looking for in a student and tell them what you bring to the table (and it sounds like you have a lot to offer with the amount of research experience you have!).  If they have room in their lab for a new student, be sure to set up an interview either in person (preferably) or over Skype to talk about their university, ideas for projects, etc. while getting a feel for their personality.  You and your advisor are going to be working long, stressful hours together, so you need to make sure you are compatible and/or functional together. 

I ended up finding a PI who studies something that I think is absolutely fascinating (diving physiology), who has a fantastic network already, and that I get along well with, and although we're not at a "top-tier" university, I feel like the implications of the research I'm doing and the opportunities I've gotten through my advisor's connections are going to surpass any advantage I'd have had I just gone to a well-known marine biology program for the sake of getting a degree from a big name school.

I hope this helps and feel free to PM me if you have any more questions!  Good luck :) 




 It did, thanks for asking!  Ended up going with a place on my own, which I think was the right choice 




 Hey, I graduated from OSU this past spring with a BS in E E and am now in a Marine Bio Master's program!

My advice on where to start is to find and read recent papers on topics that interest you.  This will give you an idea of what you are really interested in and could get passionate about (remember, you're going to be thinking about a single topic 24/7 for at least the next 2 years while doing your thesis, so you need to be sure you like it).

Then you should look up the authors of papers that caught your attention and contact people than you could see yourself working with.  It's much more important to have an advisor you feel you can be successful with than to go to a renowned Marine Bio program.

Also, don't get discouraged by rejection!  I emailed between 30 and 40 professors, got a reply from maybe 10, and only interviewed with 3.  Lucky for me, one of those 3 was my top choice for an advisor. 

If you have any other questions or would just like to talk more about this more, feel free to PM me.

Go Bucks! 




 Hey, I'm a graduate student currently studying diving physiology in marine mammals!  My lab considers penguins "honorary mammals" since they are the only birds that perform these deep dives.

The dogma in marine mammal physiology for the last 70+ years was that marine mammals simply cannot get the bends, or decompression sickness (DCS) - that they must have adaptations that made it impossible, such as their ability to collapse their lungs, slow their heart rate, quickly ventilate, stop blood from going to their lungs, etc.  HOWEVER, in the past 10 years or so, the people I am working with have found evidence that it is in fact possible!

So, although the exact cause of "the bends" or decompression DCS is not known, there is (in my opinion) overwhelming evidence that nitrogen bubbles forming in the blood and body tissues are the culprit, or at least involved in the process.  As these animals dive, the air (oxygen, carbon dioxde, nitrogen) in their lungs is dissolved in the blood.  Nitrogen is an inert gas, meaning animals do not use it for metabolic processes.  Therefore, as it moves through the bloodstream and into the tissues, it is not used up and just stays there.  As the animals dive deeper and deeper, more and more of the air in the lungs can diffuse into the blood (deeper water = [greater pressure = more dissolved gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry's_law)).  When they begin to return to the surface, the pressure gets weaker, so the gas that was dissolved in the blood starts to come out of solution and form bubbles.

Now, there is evidence that this happens on every dive (including for human divers), so why don't they get DCS every single time they do it?!?  Most of the time, the bubbles are considered "silent bubbles" which cause absolutely no damage.  These bubbles are small and the animal is able to move them back to the lungs, then remove them when they ventilate at the surface.  Too many bubbles in the bloodstream can lead to blood hemorrhaging in organs and burst blood vessels (which is what we have found in stranded/bycatch marine mammals).  What makes DCS tricky is that we haven't been able to quantify how many bubbles are" too many" bubbles in marine mammals or humans, as it seems to vary by individual.  

I know of two hypotheses for what causes DCS in marine mammals, both of which have to do with naval sonar.  The first is that the sonar causes them to freak out and ascend too quickly, leading to too many bubbles for the lungs to handle.  The second is that the energy of the sonar wave causes pressure fluctuations inside the body of the animal, causing the nitrogen bubbles to more easily come out of solution.  However, there is very little data on DCS or the effects of sonar on marine mammals and we hope to be able to answer these questions in the next few years! 




 Hello!  I posted this in the TAMUCC subreddit, but it's much less active than this one so I figured I'd post here as well.

I'm going to be a grad student (single guy, 22 yrs old) starting at TAMUCC this fall and am in Corpus this weekend looking at apartments. I'm intrigued by the concept of places like Campus Quarters or Islander Village because I'm from another state and don't know anyone here (these places set you up with 2 or 3 roommates in furnished suites), but a majority of the reviews make them sound like hell holes. I also looked at a lot of nice 1 bedroom places on the south side, but I'm worried about becoming a hermit if I live by myself. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions?

Thanks!

 Apparently, there are some branches of the libertarian political philosophy ([Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_libertarianism) and [Geolibertarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolibertarianism)) that are particularly concerned with the environment and natural resources.
