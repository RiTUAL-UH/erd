 Hes in the trees, I know it.  Hes IN the trees.  Those long sharp branches, hes tipping an entire oak to rake them along the shingles of the cabin.  Hes tracing my name as he scrapes, I can hear him scratching Thompson.   He wants to peel the roof back and open this place up like a tin of sardines.  He wants me to run.  Hes using the twigs now, tapping against the window like a child at a fish bowl.  Hello in there, he says, Im waiting.  But the cabin is safe.  He cant come in.  Thats what the ritual was all about; we were making a sacred place.  It was supposed to be filled with light, it was supposed to be refuge but we released him.  God help us, we released him.     




 what a vignette!
