 I live in Ottawa, there's perfectly made poutine all over the city. 




 'I should try out reddit because I need more faith in humanity.'

Don't venture into any of the default subs, else you'll lose whatever faith in humanity that remains. 




 I thought nothing existed outside the universe?

Which means there's an end, no? 




 Why did Hawking say the universe is infinite?  How can an expanding universe go on forever? 




 Murder is the deliberate taking of life without justification.

A Canadian can kill another person and be justified under the law in having done so.

Killing is certainly a better fit, as we do not yet know if the shooting was justified or not. 




 You're not responsible for unauthorized CC transactions, so no need to worry. 




 Ah, so in your perception of reality, no circumstance could have occurred where lethal force was justified?

Bizarre.

 




 Murder? Based upon what?

If you want to win, you must campaign from the centre, as you will lure both centre right and centre left undecided voters that are necessary for a win.

Do you want change or do you want more Harper?

If you want change, follow Mulcairs lead.

Edit - For my party, the fringe left ( which is in abundance on/r/Canada) does as much harm to it, as the fringe right does to Harpers brand.

I know, the truth hurts.  If I wanted to turn an undecided voter off my party, I'd sent her to /r/Canada. 




 ...or maybe he attacked a cop with a knife.

What do I know, I'm just an RCMP paid shill. 




 What are they protesting?

 




 I've  a theory, some people like some things  and other people like different things.
