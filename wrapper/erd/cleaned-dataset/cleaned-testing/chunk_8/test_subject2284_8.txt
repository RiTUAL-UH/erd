 Superman being pragmatic *is* plot Armour though, because superman doesn't act that way, ever. He would try to reason with his oldest friend, try to talk, try not to kill him ect. And the last time he tried to fly batman into space, he just spat kryptonite gum into supes eyes. 




 he's really not that powerful compared to other heroes. Green lantern, Flash, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Aquaman and a bunch of other justice league heroes could pretty reliably beat him, or come pretty close. 




 Nope, because if batman was really playing for keeps, he would just shoot superman with a magic, kryptonite bullet from 1000 feet away, that travels back in time and kills him whilst he was still a baby.

Comicbooks are inherently unrealistic, and Superman is *definitely* not OP, especially for the DC universe. 




 We did it reddit! 




 Batista is gay???? 




 That was actually made before Silver Linings, had massive production delays and problems, and had no marketing push. The studio deliberately chose to bury it. 




 [There's actually been quite a few anti war games recently] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-228auScq1g) 




 Just in case, I'm offering up places to the deserter dragons, y'know, if anyone's interested in being in the best damn MGO team in town. 




 Since you presumably pick characters from rescued soldiers in your mother base like in Peace Walker, probably. Hopefully there'll be female guards too. 




 WOW! A collectors edition robot arm to replace my current puny human arm! I can be just like Big Boss! 




 IT'S HAPPENING!!!

BUT, I, UH, CAN'T SEE THE SITE, SO, UM, WHAT'S HAPPENING? 




 Gee, I sure am glad the page *refreshed itself* so it stopped working. That's just... great. 




 Funnily enough, there was an article on cracked a few weeks back about a guy  who ended up thinking just that in a shooting. Scary stuff (http://www.cracked.com/article_22070_5-things-you-learn-surviving-mass-shooting.html) 




 Which is fine for mgs4.... not so great for peace walker, when the whole point is to get new guns and attachments, and you're essentially stuck using the tranq pistol/cqc the whole game. 




 I hope that we get more options for non-lethal weapons. It felt wrong to use on 2 out of a 100 guns. 




 A SHARD OF BROKEN DREAMS

DEVOURED!

DEEP INSIDE

KOJIMAS MIND! 




 IT'S UNCLEAR!

IT'S WILD

I'M BREAKING UP

INSIDE! 




 It's a problem endemic of a community that wants you to feel bad for buying AC/Call of duty, yet fetishize every annual release, and complain about every 8/10 review. These guys also don't read games blogs, they just use let's plays, Totalbiscuit and facebook for all their news, which leads to amassive amount of whining about games people  have zero knowledge of. 




 I actually push for it to be heretic, but that's just me. :) 









 That's a funny way to spell Nui. 




 'sigh' i remember the good old days of /r/killlakill having massive arguments over whether mako was Ryuko or Gamagooris love interest. 




 Borderlands 2 basically expects you to do most of the side missions, so do those before you do the 'main story' in each area, other than that, just remember to use ironsights to kill most enemies and you should be golden. 




 Shotguns and pistols are generally the best for people who suck at aiming, a couple of them, particularly torgue and jakobs brand, tend to instakill enemies. 




 We know it's in development, but since the budget will be made up if networks buy in, we have no idea if it will see the light of day, and in what state (will it be for kids?) 




 Nope. The majority of users of /r/movies really don't know enough about film to make that judgement. It would have almost exactly the same problems as oscar voting. 




 They did that. It led to This: (http://robotwars.wikia.com/wiki/Storm_2/Controversy) happening. 




 Technically, some fighting games like Blazblue do need to be be at 30 fps or less due to a lot of mechanics being based around that framerate, like Invincibility frames and stuff. 




 TWEWY, kingdom hearts, and smash bros brawl are all written by the same writer. 




 Not quite. She also banned dissenting opinion from the forums, and to get on the forums you have to have backed the game on KS, which led to a pretty large exodus for the MN9 community. When you've basically paid to have a say on the matter, the last thing you want is forum drama. 




 Not really, but this will just devolve into my (British) anecdotal evidence vs yours, so I don't really see the point arguing over it. 




 Woah! Saint Anita attacked flight of the conchords? Guess I'm moving over to KIA. 




 Manga have a different format to 'comics' though, and the sales for batman don't count TP sales. 




 Well, he's doing the rounds on british comedies. He's still got it. 




 Literally every time that movie is brought up people say its terrible, but with one good sketch. But that sketch is different every time. It's shrodingers terrible movie. 




 It gets reccomended a lot here but spec ops the line deals with this as a major theme. Metal gear solid, particularly 2 and 3 also deal with it. but that game is somewhat controversial here. 




 Whiplash is kind of tenuously about masculinity. It's more about the need to drive someone towards obsession to succeed. 




 Yeah, Marvel can see the writing on the wall. All but one of those comics is being made into film or television, and it's allowing creators and artists to make the best content possible, and take chances on well loved cult characters like moon knight and squirrel girl. They've realized that merchandise and film is frankly, more profitable than comics and acted accordingly. 




 Barbara Gordon in general is kind of a continuity nightmare. Designed for batman TV, brought back to be fridged by Alan Moore, then revamped for her longest incarnation in suicide squad.  It baffles me why they brought her back when her most notable tenure as batgirl was in cartoons. 




 Well, the other motive was to incorporate Wildstorm characters into DC, reboot a bunch of characters, and give publicity to DC. But the end result was a lot of stuff I rather enjoyed reading about, like batgirl, oracke, and secret six, was removed. 




 Yeah, as somebody who mostly knows about comics through wikis and TP's, nu52 seemed to remove a lot of the stuff I found cool in the DC universe. 




 Eh, the thing is, spider girl is Peter parkers daughter from the future, and a legacy character, She-Hulk and spider woman HAD to be called that for legal reasons, and batwoman is called that for marketing reasons, and is actually fairly seperate from the bat family. 




 If you're interested in that, check out the new spider gwen comic too. It's a really neat character that should give you some spider man lore too. To be honest, the current best way to get into comics is to read a lot of enclopedias, history books, comicvine, wikipedia and tv tropes, at least, that's how I did it. 




 Hey, at least comics are mainstream now, Anime is still way off from that,and it looks like tabletop games will never be. 




 Yeah, one can definitely make some valid criticisms of female thor, particularly as she's sort of a secondary character in the book now. The reason she's not a spin-off character is likely to draw more publicity and sales to Thor, although, ironically, it looks like the upcoming spider gwen will be a much bigger deal. 




 It wasn't just a rumor: He was Sony's top pick in those leaked E-mails. 




 I've never heard that either, I mean, the ultimate spider woman was gay, maybe that's where it's from? 




 Even though I do like Miles Morales, I can't deny that having Peter Parker interact with Tony Stark or Steve Rogers on screen has a certain romance.  




 I kind of disagree that DC has been progressive lately. The new 52 and other stuff slightly before it got rid of a lot of diversity in comics, particularly related to the bat-family and stuff. IMO, this was because DC took a while to realize that modern comics are essentially speculator scripts for films and TV, and should only really worry about influencer media. 




 Although there is quite a bit of speculation that the next MGS game will be about the boss. 




 Not to mention injustice: Gods among us. That wonder woman model was horribly proportioned. 




 There's also the fact that Anime is popular amongst several American directors, notably Tarantino and Spielberg (with Nolan and Aranofsky liberally borrowing ideas). With Tarantino moving out of movies soon, I wouldn't put it past him to try and get more 2D animation in circulation. 




 You're forgetting Beowolf. 









 You think that's impressive, check out dwarf fortress, made by one guy who makes Molyneux like promises, and over the course of 20 years, intends to meet every. single. one. 




  I'm gonna start this post with a bit of a brag, but well...


I beat manus first time. Without getting the other lord souls first

Now, I know what you're thinking, another smug post where a guy talks about his L33t skills or whatever, but the way I beat Manus wasn't really through any sort of trickery of OP weaponry or anything. I just used the 15 free full health potions given to me in the room before, that is, humanity. Because Manus isn't the most high damage, aggressive boss, (at least, compared to say, Artorias or the chuckle brothers) I basically beat him through shear perseverance and the health regen of those sweet humanities. My question is why this tactic isn't considered for noobs having a tough time compared to, say, shooting arrows through the boss door? I mean, why is just gobbling up that humanity the average player has mostly collecting dust not considered? Why is this cheesy tactic considered lower on the priority list than every other cheesy tactic? 




 I actually liked Dr who until they added unnecessary sci-fi elements to a show about a policeman walking through the fog hearing a strange noise. 




 Apparently according to early reviews they've replaced all the bad writing with actually pretty decent writing! Weird huh? 




 You may be thinking of I wanna be the guy, which is the hardest popular platformer ever made, but wasn't made by a comedian. You may also be thinking of Poles adventure, which was a wii VC platformer with a lot of jokes. 




 Sega actually released a console like this. it didn't go very well. 




 And platinum games/ retro studios/ EAD Tokyo 




 Takeshi's challenge is an anti-gamer game, created by a guy who hates video games to annoy people who like them. Although Takeshis challenge is actually kind of brilliant. 




 Says you! My link was always faithful to the item shop girl! 




 I really wouldn't put it past GG to attack her for being Trans, too. 




 I think your problem here is that you're trying to imply that Lara dying in such a way is out of the ordinary for third person action games, when it's more or less business as usual. (just look at a lot of the death videos on the sidebar of the video) Whilst the whole thing of showing those deaths making you want to 'protect' Lara can be criticised, gory deaths are basically a tomb raider staple. If you wanna check out a really bad sexualised death in a game, check out Heavy rain, where the female lead is strapped up, and the player can choose to *let her get power drilled through the vagina* 




 I was gonna say getting a drill shoved up your vagina in heavy rain, but then I realized you get your dick cut off and eaten in Outlast and P.T 




 Voyeuristic deaths are mainly a carryover from resident evil 4, which started a massive number of third-person shooter trends, so Tomb raider isn't exactly unique in this regard. Curiously, in the original tomb raider, there were apparently dev competitions to find the most violent, OTT deaths for Lara. 




 You die in a LOT of phallic ways in several videogames, particularly in a lot of survival horror. The tomb raider reboot is relatively tame, aside from the skydiving death, which is pretty gory. 




 You could say his wit is *grossly incandescent* huh? Huh? Aw.... 




 Exactly how many doritos were consumed at this party? If it's 50+ you, and your family, could be in serious dew-danger.  




 Check out 'the disaster artist' if you haven't already. The Room took 6 million dollars to make, and the book explains where that money went. 




 It's always depressing to see the little quirky bits on the end of trailers for cancelled projects.
 




 I wouldn't call wonderful 101 more niche than Madworld or Anarchy reigns. 




 Yep. 




 We're waiting for confirmation, but a LOT of UI elements in the early trailers were showing multiplayer components. 




 Molyneux is well aware of his capacity to overpromise, which makes it all the more baffling when he does it again. 




 It's right there on Jims Patreon, as well as TB always talking about him/giving him youtube comments. 




 Yeah, after seeing this I was surprised it wasn't already posted. What happened in the last thread? 




 [This] (https://twitter.com/SimonHoneydew/status/559688739107405824)  was the tweet that offended TB so 




 The developer came to them when they were still making videos in their bedrooms, and the dev made some fairly awful decisions. (like giving a years salary to a guy who genuinely did basically run off with it) The yogs actually lost a tonne of money from the deal (100K+) 




 Yeah, the yogscast is probably the second biggest fish in Polaris after pewdiepie, so they hold enough power to do what they want. However, figures like Angry Joe and Jim Sterling can't do to much, as TB's one of their biggest supporters (and TB gives Jim a tonne of Patreon money) 




 Yeah, Lewis was talking about that in his reddit post. 




 All Simon did was make a disparaging remark, he wasn't asking for an attack or making some kind of political statement. 




 To be fair, as a fan of the yogscast, It's been a long time coming. Tb attacked both over the yogventures debacle and the yogdiscovery programme (a method of paid promotion), the criticism caused Lewis Brindley, the 'head' of the yogscast, to make a very disparaging reddit post about TB's apparent hypocrisy. TB has been *very* effectively burning bridges lately. 









 Yeah, if you have the money, you might as well get a console if bloodborne is good, PS+ is a really excellent service, too. 




 Oh... I guess I'll just go back to paying bayonetta 2 and waiting for bloodborne :( 




 **You better be** unless you're on a console other than PS3, in which case I have no way to attack you, and you can just go along merrily on your way. 




 I don't know who you are, or where your world is,but my first playthrough of the game has given me a very special set of skills. I will track your world down, I will find you, and I **will invade you** 




 Well, American animations such as Simpsons, south park, Futurama and Family Guy have had queer relationships pretty much since their inceptions, and you also have a fair amount of stuff in weirder kids cartoons, that can arguably been seen as as explicit. (Ren and Stimpy and stuff) And technically, batman TAS introduced a gay character (Renee Montoya) and had a lesbian relationship (which was later confirmed in comics) in the poison ivy/ Harley Quinn thing. 




 You're thinking of battlefront 3, which was made by the creators of timesplitters, was almost finished, and then got cancelled because lucasarts was run by morons at the time. 




 You're never going to have a truly meritocratic awards show about a subjective art medium, the best hope is to acknowledge as many films deserving of awards as possible. Sure, a Japanese anime will never win best picture, but at least it can get acknowledged in some format, hence why people want a 'best stunts' category, the best action film of the year will never win anything otherwise. 




 Oh, thanks to TB, there's still people who care about ethics (they don't like Sarkeesian and think Gone Home has too high a metacritic average) and decide to re-post all the stuff bashing strawman 'SJW's onto my facebook wall. 




 I believe it's something to do with YT comments pushing 'controversial' comments with lots of replies  to the top. 




 I'm not really such a fan of that scene. I feel that the premise of ten martial arts masters fighting one Kung fu grandmaster is lost in order to show how badass ip-man is, and it lacks directorial flair (why is the last guy just another mook? he's on his own after seeing ip man beat everyone else, surely he would react differently?) 




 Not much money for CG on a 4.5 million budget. 




 That's a disservice to the animated medium. The clone wars show was completely independent of Episode 3, and George noticeably changed grievous representation from the cartoon. It also had far *far* superior direction and fight sequences to episode 3. (the attack on Coruscant is better than everything in episode 3) f George Lucas actually was influenced by Anime, he would have probably used more camera angles than two for every dialogue scene. 




 My tactic was to poison fog them all and then do other stuff. It's not the most efficient way, but it's super satisfying to see your soul count gradually rise and that damage stack up. 




 Yeah, yep, the catacombs area was designed for a suicide run/false path. Hence why the zweihander and binoculars are there.  




 He got an award at the game awards no? TB has a large following in the 'games media' community, the people who visits games websites and stuff. He's not important to the world, or gaming as a whole, or even 'hardcore' but he is important to the people who frequent games media, like me. 




 Exactly. Games developers are, as far as I'm aware, all pretty liberal, and almost every game other than really obviously sexist stuff (like duke nukem forever) usually have issues of 'sexism' that are debatable. ("that's optional, that's a playable character ect) Which is why I find praise of good imagery preferable to critiques of supposedly bad imagery. I don't doubt the industry should improve artistically, I just doubt FF's videos explaining in a sentence why dozens of games are sexist are the best way to do so, and tend to trigger incediary reactions from people who are fairly moderate. 




 Or that developers are just *lazy*. I think most examples of the damsel in distress trope portrayed in games is due to not wanting to bother making a story, and using basic stereotypes (I.E Arthurian romance) to create a situation that universally translates, such as the princess is locked in a castle etc. 




 Casual is used as a pseudonym of 'Game I don't like' or 'Game that's not very good'. Which is the same isolationist, fatalistic approach to games that keeps companies making poor quality games, because the people who play super-creative, well made games are discouraged from talking about them to 'casual' relatives. 




 Although it's still noticeably better than the cesspit that is Dota 2.
