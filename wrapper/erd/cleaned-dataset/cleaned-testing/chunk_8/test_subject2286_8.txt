 I'm talking about the lack any pro Hillary headlines in /r/politics. Wouldn't there have to be some if, per your narrative, if it was a pro-Hillary circlejerk?  




 A search of "Hilary" in /r/politics is showing the newest posts to be things like:

 Martin OMalley Criticizes Hillary Clinton for Flip-Flopping

 Hillary Clinton Said to Hire Former Wall Street Cop as Campaign CFO

 Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement video is creepy 

 Gutfeld: Hillary's Campaign Rollout More Staged Than 'My Fair Lady'

 How John Roberts Made Hillary Clinton President

 Hillary Clinton campaign to accept lobbyist donations

 Doesn't seem  like /r/politics is trying to justify Hillary at all. 




 Did you know that income taxes paid by individuals account for only 46 percent of all federal tax revenue? 




 Hillary wants outlaw abortions and gay marriage and repeal Obamacare?   









 Wasn't he supposed to be dead or in jail two years ago? 




 Oh Look, yet another minority politician that Glenn Beck wouldn't vote for. 




 541,000 more people having money taken from their weekly paychecks and put into the Social Security Trust Fund.  




 Anyone want to name the achievements of any other person currently running for POTUS?  




 Shes more Like LBJ, but shorter, and with less penis, more balls. 




 We're gonna in up puttin' Nancy Reagan on the Twenty, I just know it. 




 It's been two year since Ted Nugent was supposed to be dead or in jail if Obama was reelected, so we at least know that making a prediction like that one or calling the President a subhuman mongrel, doesn't fit the criteria for who gets on the kill list. 




 Liberty University students "were mandated" to attend Sen. Ted Cruzs presidential announcement "or they would be fined."

 Jeez, from the headline, I was expecting a link to XHamster. 



















 Meanwhile property taxes in Alabama are like 0.33%. 



















 OP didn't write the headline or the article, OP just posted on Reddit.  




 These kids are probably on some pedos radar by now, and no good will come of that either. 




 This was probably true in 1858 as well.  




 Remember when this article was about the Right pissing all over themselves  because Obama decided to negotiate with Tehran?

OP remembers.  














 I wouldn't be surprised. I live in a neighborhood with alot of hispanics and I've noticed one thing, no single parents.   




 I propose that we use his full birth-name, Rafael Eduardo Cruz, every time he is referred to from now on. You know, like in '08 whenever conservatives mentioned Obama, they said "Barack Hussein Obama". 




 I suppose the correct response would have been to issue a letter of marque and reprisal. 




 Saying that someone would be an excellent office holder if elected and saying that you endorse that candidate for that office is two different things.  




 I feel like we need another Truman or LBJ, so Hillary Clinton. 




 The threat of incarceration even though it's a non violent offence? 




 What President wouldn't say their former Secretary of State would be "excellent president"? It would be news worthy if he had said he didn't really think she was up to the job or something.   




 Would not paying the ticket count as a "nonviolent crime", would they get another ticket for that? 




 Nonpayment of child support is a victimless crime? 




 Ten lines in
"The government ought to leave non-violent offenders alone," said Paul. "If a guy is selling loose cigarettes and not paying the king's ransom in taxes, couldn't we give him a ticket instead of throwing him to the pavement?

Maybe you should read more than the first paragraph. This about more than drugs, he even mentions people being jailed for nonpayment of court ordered child support. 




 And selling untaxed cigarettes and not paying court costs and not paying student loans. 




 And what do we do if he doesn't pay the ticket worth billions? Write him one for trillions? That'll teach 'em. 




 "Even with child support, its a good example of how unintended consequences come about," Paul said.

Clearly he is talking about more than just drugs here. 




 Literally.  




 Look up Chain of Fools and Run Through the Jungle. 




 Y'all realize that the Banksters and corrupt politicians count as "non-violent offenders", right? 














 That one is sheer masterpiece of the form and fortunately it's can be found in high quality, making it a great one to introduce someone who might like horror or Sci-fi, but has never listened to OTR.  




 On the other hand, if the big timber companies had a big lay-off, it would cost a lot in unemployment checks, but only until they ran out. Sometimes protectionist policies cost us more in the long run than they save us in the short term. 




 Love Gunsmoke, it's my favorite otr show. Thought you were pulling my leg because I recently heard this episode and the first minute or two didn't sound any different, then when Miss Kitty came in, it all went to hell. Also love the new look. Great Job! 




 Ron Paul fared much worse in the Republican primaries among old voters, who are the GOP base. 









 Nixon didn't hold an elected office after losing to Kennedy in 60, until he was elected President in 68. 




 Because Fu Manchu is immortal!  



















  Iran? Lying? Unfathomable. 




 Wouldn't want to be mistaken for anything else. 




 So Breitbart is endorsing Bill for First Gent?  




 So Aztecs or Satanist should still be able to practice Human sacrifice, right? or Christians should be able to deny service to blacks because they believe they bear the Mark of Cain? Muslim fathers should be able to kill their daughter if she is raped?  




 According to this, Mitt Romney still has a better shot than Elizabeth Warren? 




 I guess he figures that if all americans went to a tent revivals, found Jesus and became an evangelicals, we could just have a theocracy and wouldn't need a separation of church and state?    




 This woman has never even so much as served on a local school board or a city council, but thinks she is qualified to be leader of the free world? 




 With 150 bodies, 600 body parts would be 4 body parts per person. 




 So is the NYPost admitting that Google dictates what they print or admitting that they aren't news? 




 So you're asking how you can get deeper into an echo chamber   not have your ideological beliefs challenged by an outside narrative? 




 Ted Cruz may be trailing in something that kinda, sorta matters, but hes winning big in something that means jack-squat. 




 And he can tell his many pen-pals your address.  




 And it's not like they were even complicated bass lines. 









 People with "White collar jobs" don't usually get "welfare, Food Stamps and free health care".
 




 Double plus bad for Winston, it's Room 101 for him for not throwing that clip down the memory hole. 









 I don't support the Death Penalty, but there is no way that being shot in the head, at close range by a professional marksman is less humane than being a guinea pig.    




 Funny how there is no mention of how many of them are murderers or rapist, like percentages, just that some of them are. You could be considered a criminal alien just for speeding or driving without a licence.    














 You're paying your own way and not receiving a handout?  




 Several candidates are claiming that they'll dismantle Obamacare on day one if elected, for purely ideological reasons, despite the fact that it's lowering the deficit. I would call that relevant.    




 If what you say is true, then no one at WND, Townhall or American Thinker is a Conservative. 














 Jeff Beck does use anything but his thumb. 




 

From the actual poll

For each of the following pairs of statements, tell me which one
better describes your perfect candidate, even if neither is exactly right. 

The candidate shares your views on all major issues 51%

The candidate may not share all of your views on major issues, but
belongs to the party you prefer and has a good chance of winning 47%

No opinion 3%  




 And there we have it Ladies and Gentlemen, proof that the GOP really is racist. 









 Thus whites aren't at any significant threat from blacks who mostly live in different neighbourhoods and mostly self victimize one another?  

Which raises the question, why do you care what the percentage of crimes committed by blacks are, if it's mostly black on black crime?

Are you a black Democrat?   




 Betteridge's law of headlines is an adage that states: "Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no."  The reason why journalists use that style of headline is that they know the story is probably bullshit, and dont actually have the sources and facts to back it up, but still want to run it.

 And most of their victims are of what race? You seem to have left that part out. 




 **FACT:** Most murders are committed by right-handed people!

**DOES THAT INFORMATION IN AND OF ITSELF MEAN A DAMNED THING?:** No.   




 John Byrne pencils, which is why they look like Superman and Lois, other than that, I don't know.   




 And then post about it. 




 Bill Pullman didn't know either. 









 I would like to see more citizens voting, because they care and are well informed. I not sure compulsory voting wouldn't be much different than having 15-20% of the votes cast by a Magic 8-ball.  




 R. Lee Ermey hardly blinks at all IRL.  




 Trump is watching you. 




 Be that as it may, they still choose who represents us in Washington, at least the ones who bother to vote. 




 The average american assumes that if they aren't smuggling illegal drugs, supporting terrorist or downloading child-porn, that nothing will ever come of it.  




 Most "Americans" don't descend from the Pilgrims either.  




 Still doesn't explain why he would call a Buick a "Magnum". 




 Bentley's lawyers said marriage is a natural reality and that same-sex marriage destroys the "rights of children to be connected to their biological parents."

What about adoption or divorce? 



















 Kim Jong Un didn't get any money from The Interview either. 




 Why was there an American meat crisis in 1910? 




 That's only a 18 year span, from the time LBJ died till Nixon did was a 21 year span. 




 And Ben Carson's First One as well!  









 RINGO! 




 The ending of Born in the U.S.A. 









   "The 'wisdom of the crowds' is the most ridiculous statement I've heard in my life. Crowds are dumb. It takes people to move crowds in the right direction, crowds by themselves just stand around and mutter."

"I don't care what anyone says, the masses are morons. My own grandmother is an idiot. You can't count on them to pick good stuff. Just check out Network TV to see what the masses want for entertainment. There's certainly a place for that kind of thing but it's not on Fark. Now go away and let me finish taking a crap!" 









 Could some of you right-wingers ELI5, how NOT having a deal with Iran will somehow stop them from developing a bomb? 









 Do you want to be PM'd Dickpics? 

Cause this is how you get PM'd Dickpics. 




 But the average age of Republicans is now approaching 50, so in 20 or 30 years this might mean something. 




 Not since the freed slaves took all their jobs. 




 Who said that? Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck? 




 But this is one of the other 22 times. 



















 Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, cleaned up Times Square. Why? Because he hated New York. 



















 Buenos Aires, Falafel, Fuckin' thing sucks, do it live. 




 And that's with Facebook, Reddit, Skyrim and GTA 5. Think about how bad we were back in the 80's when most of us first got cable and VCR's for the first time. 




 Giuliani had 'Mafia' influences at an early age

 Peace through Strength is not a foreign policy and does not stop terrorism.

Terrorism isn't the only or even the chief reason for a policy of "Peace through Strength". The Partitions of Poland wouldn't have happened if the Liberum veto had not made a stronger military response impossible. Transparency could keep wasteful spending in check.

Side supply or Trickle Down Economics does not make a strong economy.

Pretty much agree. 









  Or heard of Pompeii. 




 Even I, a left-wing circlejerker, agree. 




 But he's still down with pot   gold, right? 




 So a minority of rich people tried to take over a country and install communism?  




  "If by Sweet, Rich ejaculate
 you mean another 59 months of continuous job growth and falling unemployment, then yes Sweet, Rich ejaculate
". 




 Just months after showing support for mandatory quarantines?  














 Some of the new measures taking effect will include mandatory job training and minimum weekly work hour requirements, both despised enemies of lazy government leeches.

So let me get this straight, the assumption here is that if they are required to work in order to continue receiving welfare, that these people will not continue to receive welfare and will instead go out and get a job so that they will not have to get a job in order to continue receiving welfare benefits? 

 




 Back in the days when they still marketed cigarettes? 




 Some were never seeing a doctor before Obamacare. 




 I think they decided they didn't want to be crucified upon a cross of gold back in 1896. 




 I don't know anything about this video, but Ted Gunderson has been dead for four years. 




 Guy, second from the top left, isn't praying, he is thinking. 




 St.Peter dontcha call me cuz' I can't go,

 I owe my soul to the company store. 




 Wonder why there is no mention of the towns population (2,786) in this article and why would it cost a town that size "$350,000 a year" to have a police force? 




 Why aren't there any guns where you live? 




 By all means, feel free to go looking for more freedom and prosperity somewhere else and let us know how that works out for you.  




 Deleting Leaks, that's not how this works. That's not how any of this works. 




 Conservatives are like

"Ha, Ha, Hilary could lose again!"

"Oh Fuck, Warren could Win!?!?" 









 So when it comes to mandatory vaccination for contagious diseases and openly carrying loaded firearms in supermarkets, we need to get government out of our lives, but when it comes to who we marry and what we wear, we need more government in our lives?    




 You'd have to get remarried if you move to a different state, if not, then it wouldn't stop gay marriage because gays would just go to another state to get married and come right back, thus nullifying any state law against gay marriages.

 So it was really Democratic President Lyndon Baines Johnson, who was opposed to the Civil Rights Act and Republicans that shoved it down his throat? Funny, I remembered it differently.

 You've been here a year clicking links and reading comments, but never posting? Do you work for the Government? 




 I don't remember the Democrats calling for mandatory euthanasia of the mentally handicapped. Was that before or after the GOP called for drug testing them?

 The problem is that in order to get people as diverse as Stalin and Churchill to cooperate, you need a Hitler.   




 Which proves he isn't shaping public option or defining the narrative and hasn't been for sometime now.  




 It proves that most people don't get their information from the "Mainstream Media" anymore. That broadcast networks no longer have the ability to shape public option anymore.   
























 70% have four or more toolbars.

 One thing I noticed. At no point in this story do they mention when the under employed and those who have given up looking for work stopped being counted in the unemployment numbers. Where they ever counted? 




 Didn't say anything was wrong with it, just isn't usually done that way in the U.S. Just like the way he has his legs crossed at the knees, in the U.S. men generally lay one ankle on the other knee. 




 Actually I based my assumption on the way the dude on the right is holding his cigarette.   




 Foreign aid. Trade sanctions. 




 I'm guessing this is Europe. 




 More like over 70 years ago

In 1948, the Democratic President Harry S. Truman ordered the end of racial discrimination in the U.S. Army, proposed the creation of a permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission, supported the elimination of state poll taxes (which effectively discriminated against poor blacks and whites in voting), and supported drafting federal anti-lynching laws.
