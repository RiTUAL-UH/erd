 How is that a twist?  That's pretty much a non-surprise for a Republican politician. 




 That's awesome - I keep forgetting how big Chaos Crags is, and how rawly volcanic it is, being relatively young.  And you can actually see a lot more than three volcanoes in this picture, more like ten ... including at least two calderas (Tehema and the always forgotten Yana). 




 Go over to /r/badhistory, they're not really happy with glorification of an ultimately overturned and replaced document that doesn't actually have any legal ramifications today. 




  Don't forget about the war against religious freedom!!!

It's easy to forget about something that doesn't exist.

  I'd say she probably had no relationship with her parents to speak of.

With her parents, her siblings, *reality* ... 




  Yet a woman who identifies as black is somehow an embarrassment to the left.

A woman who *pretended* to be black, and used that as a way to fraudulently gain benefits and position, and also very likely faked a series of supposed hate-crimes and threats against her.

There's no parallel situation, no matter how desperately you *want* it to be true. 




  Same birther ringer as Obama.

What does that even *mean*? 




 Sooo ... you didn't read the article, and have no idea what it's actually about, I see. 




 I've lived in Northern California my whole life, and now I'm really bothered by the fact that I've never been in a basement, and can't even think of a building I've been in that had one. 




 ... I went to high school in a time before cell phones or anything resembling iPods.  And the textbooks were a few years old and provided by the school to every student. 




  And everyone knows where everyone else's locker is and being able to 'meet up' there.

That ... uh, kind of describes my school.  Only 300 students, though, grades 7-12.

Also being conveniently able to crack open a locker and leave something inside and the other person isn't remotely freaked out by the breach of security.

We actually didn't bother with the whole "locking" thing, either.  What's the worst that could happen?  Because the answer is "nothing." 




 ... how is that supposed to be relevant? 




  You're left with a vessel that could easily kill a heavy cruiser, likely cause captains of battle cruisers to have kittens, give battleships pause for thought and not start a war.

You're left with a vessel that could easily be outrun by a heavy cruiser, would get stomped by a battlecruiser, and would thrill a battleship captain for the chance to practice some gunnery.  It was a mediocre ship built of compromises and wishful thinking. 




  It was a Disneyland clone that opened 6 years after the real Disneyland

He phrased it poorly - Nara Dreamland opened 20 years before the official Tokyo Disneyland. 




  He... isn't?

Not a credible one.  We're talking about the guy that claimed the Obama stimulus of 2009 caused the recession of 2008. 




  If race is a social construct,

There are genetic, ethnic, and historical elements to race. 




 It may have just been a reference to the scarcity of Tiger I vs. American Sherman encounters. 




 I have a hunch it's because there *are* elk in NE California, and it was just a mistaken name.

Then again, Thousand Lakes Wilderness only has like twelve small lakes, so who knows.  Maybe they just drew names out of a hat. 




  Sputnik prints stuff your corporate MSM won't touch

I just looked at the headlines for http://sputniknews.com/us/, and what do you know!  It's all a bunch of stuff heavily covered in the American mass-media. 




  For example, the US airforce has mishaps on a daily basis, as well as the US Navy and Marines.

The U.S. has about three times as many combat aircraft, so a higher raw number of accidents is to be expected.  

The *rate*, however, of attrition of Russian aircraft should be worrying to the Russian Ministry of Defence, given how slow both their upgrade (of Soviet-era equipment) and procurement (of new aircraft) programs are right now. 




 Mission Accomplished. 




 Thank you, Devan Lochees. 




  It was so thrilling and if we smoked, we might have lit some cigarettes after that sequence.

Four hours later, I had to consult a doctor.

 I checked - all our memes seem to have retired. 




 A ladybug.  Everyone loves them, so I'm not going to get squashed. 




  most people prefer to keep their private parts private, 

The problem is that a lot of women *choose* to wear day-to-day clothing where nipples are noticeable through the fabric.  I prefer to think that it's on purpose. 




 Hmmm.  Spoilers, obviously.

Brys Beddit dissecting Rhulad Sengar.

The Church scene from *Kingsman*.

Logan Ninefingers vs. Golden whateverhisnamewas in *Red Country*.

Mark Vorkosigan taking down Baron Ryoval.

If we include battles, pretty much every major battle written by Steve Erikson in the *Malazan Books of the Fallen*, but especially the Siege of Capustan, the Chain of Dogs, and Second Yghatan.

I'm sure I'll think of more later. 




 "Get drunk alone and weep bitterly."

It's not for everyone, but I'll figure it'll be popular with redditors. 




 Logan Ninefingers.

Either that or Karsa Orlong. 




 Nickleback has at least two or three good songs.  The trick is to pick out a couple you like the sound of, and never listen to any of their other songs, because they're pretty much the same.

Also, I'll admit that I like Avril Lavigne's "Complicated," simply because I like the way her voice sounds in it.  I couldn't care less about the lyrics. 




 Just remember ... it doesn't actually matter. 




 Get laid. 




  I am going to a flight school at UC Davis

When did UCD get a flight school?  I'm assuming it's out on the airfield west of 113. 




 I really expect better of Star Trek:TOS than to get Old West history wrong. 




  Passion of the Christ is actually incredibly accurate to the bible,

Which version?  The four Gospels are all contradictory. 




  I'd almost like to see that one re-made.

Michael Bay kind of did that.  Unfortunately. 




 I'll be happy to trash him *in* context, too. 




 Kyle fucking Williams. 




 I'm too broke to afford new books, so I just stick with the ones I've read again and again.

(The nearest used bookstore is 70 miles away, and inter-library loan isn't very effective when the other libraries in the network also have the same poor selection). 




  Discover that Iron Age civilizations are pretty good a farming and engineering

I can't help but think that there's plenty of mid-19th Century levels of improvements that could be applied to improve 500 BCE agricultural methods.  

But I don't know shit about farming, so I can't actually name any. 




 The Burkes and Ticos are almost as long, almost as heavy tonnage-wise, and far more heavily armed. 




  Good news: Brandon sanderson is a machine, and we will get a book every two years.

We'll also get other Sanderson stuff, because writing medium sized books is how he takes a break from writing huge books. 




 Aircraft carriers aren't surface combatants? 




  you can't really eat mayo alone either.

Not with that attitude. 




  So Pat has several currency systems because he's into economics,

On that note, I'd really like an explanation of why Kvothe got change back from that tailor in Tarbean.  If the cost was one talent even, and Kvothe handed him a talent ... why did he get two jots back? 




 The most annoying part about that exchange is that Kvothe *uses the subjunctive mood* in his story telling.  He (and therefore Pat) obviously finds it useful. 




 The only recently notable (4.0+) earthquake in the Shasta/Lassen area was fault-caused, not volcanic. 




  It's just a bunch of government money funding "science" that produces the results government is looking for.

Given that the results are exactly the opposite of what the government wants to hear (we're fucking shit up, and it'll be expensive to fix), that's laughable.  And there's not much money in climate research. 




  In the 70s we were all supposed to freeze to death.

No, we weren't, and this is bullshit point brought up by climate deniers as some bizarre trump card that scientists aren't omniscient.  The "a new Ice Age might be coming" thing was a briefly lived theory in narrow circles that saw some popular media publication, before fading away in the face of things like *evidence* and *provable facts*. 




  They're war criminals,

That's the part that isn't proven.
 




 No, *he's* an idiot - a fat fundie racist redneck.

I'm just drunk. 




 I'm honestly curious ... how did you figure out how to post on Reddit?  Because someone as mind-bogglingly stupid as you ... well, it's quite an achievement.  I don't want to take it away from you. 




  why are they here???

Why are you here?

can't they just go back to iraq :)

Because all Muslims in the U.S. are from Iraq.  It's impossible that some of them came from other countries, or were born here.  Not possible, right? 




 The President is black. 




 And I'm sure you've been saying that for a long time. 




 Uh, is there some reason you can't listen to it anymore? 




 Huh ... didn't know you were still around. 




 Do you want to drive Fox News out of business? 




 Parents will still be able to order soda for their children at no extra cost  but they will have to ask for it.

The horror!

Oh, wait, not so much. 




   EPA regulations are tightening and they've pretty much killed coal.

Bullshit.  Cheap NG is cutting into coal. 




  But Obama told us the economy was going great. 

It was just a couple of months ago that Republicans in Congress were taking credit for the positive economy of late 2014.
 




  Any troops we would have stationed there would have been assigned peacekeeping -- not frontline -- roles.

Because there's such a difference in Iraq.  Hint: There isn't.

Their presence alone would be enough to deter any major assaults.

In what fucking lunatic reality would this have been true?  Because not this one, where the presence of American troops *invited* attack.  You know, here in the *real fucking world* where we have **fourteen years** of examples of this happening on a daily basis.  Then again, that probably dates back to before you were born.

You liberals are pathetic.

I really hope you're being paid to be this stupid. 




  Almost none would be needed to sustain those gains.

Hey, look, something that completely ignores TEN FUCKING YEARS OF ACTUAL HISTORY. 




 Not feeling much sympathy here, especially since she played the race card right off the bat as an excuse for her own horrible behavior. 




 Nope.

And yes, that's pretty fucking uncivilized. 




 For how many decades?

Iraq shouldn't be propped up with American blood. 




 ... OK, that doesn't disprove anything.  It's still free housing, of the non-carboard box variety. 




  even Colorado class battleship would have fended off the Bismark with ease.

The more modern fast BBs, sure, but even the post-Pearl upgraded Colorados would've had a rough time with the Bismark. 




  probably 

Sooo ... you're saying there's a chance. 




 Don't Starve. 




  but there is something about a physical CD that's impossible to replicate.

Oh, God, we've reached this point. 




  I don't get how they never decided to change tactics in that war. 

Read a book on WWI.  They did, they were just limited by the technology of the time. 




 I found a deer while mowing the lawn.  And while walking to the store.  And while driving from Point A to Point B.  And that was just today.

They're like big rats, but they come out in the daylight. 




 You have trouble with reading comprehension. 




 Well, not wearing a hat saying "FUCK IT" for months to come. 




 If you're not a sociopath, *yes*. 




  That looks ridiculously archaic.

That just makes it more appropriate. 




  If we're going with that era, I'd roll with J.J. Stokes.

Eh, J.J. Stokes is pretty well known as The Guy Who Didn't Replace Jerry Rice. 




 Justin Smith disagrees. 




  Therefore those responsible for such acts must have some legitimate reason for 'acting out' 

Ah, yes, all those liberals defending ISIS.  They're everywhere! 




 Not on the weekends.  That's when all the conservatives show up to downvote brigade. 




  Asked some folks where I could get some good Mexican and was recommended jimboys.

What did you do to piss them off?  Everyone in the Central Valley knows to go to a roach coach for good Mexican. 




 You mean like bombing the shit out of them, like we've been doing for a year?  Or heavily arming and supporting the Iraqi army, like we've been doing for twelve years?  Those things? 




 In an article in the National Review, Stanford academic Victor Davis Hanson

Should've known his name would pop up. 




  Now they're trying to persuade us that illegal immigrants don't drink water?

Residential water consumption is a small fraction of California's water usage - a few million immigrants don't have much of an impact. 




 Hell, I haven't even paid for MasterSplitter. 




  Oh, but are you saying a 6th grade child can't speak ONE VERSE! 

No, I didn't.  

Fucking hell, are you off your meds?  Because there are clearly medications that you should be on.

stop banning stuff.

Not teaching something in a public school as being true is not the same as banning. 




 Of course they can learn *about* them.  But such works shouldn't be taught as truth.  

And who said anything about denying?  Anyone of any age is generally all right (barring age restrictions, like for pornography) to read whatever they want in their free time.  Saying a child can't be taught a book in school isn't the same as saying they can't read it otherwise.

And you keep bringing up book-burning, which I haven't endorsed.  Do you even know what "strawman argument" means? 




 I don't want to deny the world books.  Why did you even put books in quotation marks?  

I want to make sure children are being taught reality, not mythology.  Reason, not faith.  They can be taught *about* belief systems, as long as that teaching is even-handed, and doesn't favor one over another, and doesn't claim that any one is true. 




 Do you ... do you even realize how crazy you sound?  I mean like, at all? 




 Oh, you're a fundie.  Sorry, I thought I was engaging in a rational debate with a sane person.

 




  Oh, but if you would disallow a small child in 6th grade from using a certain book, isn't that book as good as burnt? 

No ... no, it isn't.  Religious texts *shouldn't be used for instruction* in a public school.  That's what I'm getting at.  

What other books would you disallow 6th graders from reading? Using your own criteria, couldn't "christian fundamentalists" choose 1000 books to burn on the pyre? Using your own logic of course.

... Wow, you've got an entire *field* of strawmen that you're busy attacking.  Persecution complex much? 




 Who said anything burning? 




  What other books would you toss in the trash and not let a child learn from?

When it comes to a public school, I'd sure as hell start with the Bible. 




  I disagree. I could quote Galileo, and still have a captive audience.

That wouldn't be an endorsement of religion at a government function. 




 That's some 1980s OMNI type font, there. 




 There was the shootdown by the USN of Libyan planes over the Gulf of Sidra in 1981 and 1989, with a combined 4 Libyan aircraft destroyed.

Four USAF F-16s shot down four Serbian planes in 1994, during the Banja Luka Incident.

And, of course, the Gulf War: here's a list of air-to-air engagements (that resulted in a Coalition victory) during Desert Storm:

 To anyone that's watched both Arrow and Daredevil, is Arrow as good?  Because Daredevil was fucking awesome, so I'm afraid of being let down by watching Arrow. 




  I shouldn't, should I?

No, you shouldn't.  I watched it as it first aired, and never rewatched it.  I think LOST was worth the ride, though.  Then ending was good enough, considering how bad it *could* have been. 




 Praline and dick. 




 The aliens were actually demons, the water they were affected by was supposed to be holy water. 




 The really big ones tend to have a low population density but geographic   economic homogeneity, so there's no need to break them up. 




 A very accurate way to describe civil rights limitations.  No right is absolute, there are always conditions and limitations, as there should be. 




  Harkness and surrounding area are great, if you want to focus on it for a few days, not really a highlight worth additional driving if you're pressed for time.

Ah, I'm definitely not pressed for time when it comes to the Park.  I live on the road leading to Juniper, so I can make a day trip a few times a week, if I like. 




  terminal geyser and harkness are nothing special.

I'll second this, but only because I want to save them for myself.

They're more subtle, like Devil's Kitchen, or Jakey Lake and the whole eastern lake loop next to Caribou.  I prefer that over the touristy stuff.
