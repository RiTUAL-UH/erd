 I agree, it's annoying that a lot of people have seen the funniest 5 minutes of his shows without sitting through the 7 minutes of real talk on the issue. I watch the show religiously and I'm not even American.

 Just to be the devil's advocate here, horses die. People die. Sometimes when they are doing sports. 
Horses aren't beaten, the crop is used to communicate to the horse because it is too loud to use voice commands. 
Now, is it not just a little suspicious that the favorite horse collapsed right after doing a race it's done hundreds of times before? It's worth considering that maybe this was sabotage, poison perhaps. 
I'm not saying it's not worth looking into, maybe Melbourne is just too hot in November to do this. 
Horse racing is not inherently cruel. Races happen every single day. Physical endeavors just get more dangerous the more elite they get.
