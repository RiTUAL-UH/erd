 What is going on with that dude's Adam's apple? 




 Hate to tell you this but this gets posted about every other day here 




 Paper Planes by MIA. I just have yet to meet someone who doesn't like that song no matter what they listen to 




 Gives me a reason to go to Walmart other than Great Value 




 3 years you say I'll take that into consideration 




 I'd be ensconced in it 




 Dating app called Tinder. you "swipe right" on the girls you'd like to meet, or you know, hook up with 




 To think someone was so excited to get this. Maybe it was a kid. Maybe it was someone's girlfriend. And now to be left as this, trash thrown out, and not even a bag was spared. 




 There needs to be more XL size beer glasses 




 You're the person I hated to fight in my judo class cuz you're hard to throw 




 This is pretty tempting 




 My friend this NYE wore a vest with a button down shirt under it with a fedora. At first I thought it was ridiculous but he actually pulled it off well. Maybe it was his lack of a neckbeard, or any beard for that matter 









 I know it's already been said but this was freakin awesome! You did an amazing job editing that with the video and sounds and the order of it. I'm crying right now 




 Yeah pretty much. Also "having" a baby with your friend is a bad idea 




 intra-meta 




 They wasted the place tagging it is what they did. If they could keep this up it's like the ultimate club house for you and your friends 




 Wish I had known the point before I first pressed it. Just another 59 :( 




 I think I got 60?
 




 I pressed it without even thinking. Guess I'm just a sucker for peer pressure 




 "Plot twist: How I Met Your Father is about woman #31." from a comment there. This would actually be awesome. It could allow for a whole different dynamic, any type of show really. They could film it now so they have the final scene (since NPH would be aging throughout it) and it'd be just like HIMYM 




 Don't worry.. ducky tie comes back. It finds a way 




 The first time I watched it that day I enjoyed it. Then I watched it again an hour later with my girlfriend and didn't like it. The more I thought about it the more I didn't like it. I have to say I haven't watched any episode from Season 9 since, I've rewatched the rest of it plenty though 




 I'm sure at least 10. The problem is I'll watch a random one in like Season 5 then have to start at the beginning and watch all of them 




 This means I have to pay rent today :( and no gold to pay with 




 For those high sodium slices of bread 




 "Rice is great when you're hungry and want 2000 of something" 




 I was gonna say 58 of these would probably wipe out Europe 




 And that one movie with Seth Rogan 




 /r/im18andinhistory101 




 "Hey check out this funny cat gif" 




 I just picture 50 cent having a temper tantrum then running out of his grandma's house 




 They are 2 days from retirement 




 I guess it really depends on where you are going. I would say use google alot to figure out the best transportation though. You're probably going to have to take a taxi/subway/bus or whatever to get from one city to another or even just within a city 




 My senior prom was in the Space Needle which was awesome. As far as dancing n stuff goes though it was pretty mellow 




 He's probably waiting for the parachute to come out 




 When is Bryan Cranston finally just going to be an underwear model? 




 Turbotax this year had animations like a popup book. It was almost too EZ 




 Sites like twitter and yelp must be the best and worst thing for companies. I can't imagine getting your whole business destroyed by social media. Not that they didn't necessarily deserve it 




 It's also based on other things I've heard of the show. If you want to make a case for it though go ahead, I'd give a second chance 




 I know what you mean. All of a sudden plates are bowls and pieces of bread are plates 




 I actually forgot about Guardians but yeah that was a great movie. And I'm sure plenty of people on Reddit are big superhero fans but I think the masses will lose interest when there's lesser known superhero movies and too many sequels of existing ones 




 I've seen only about 1 episode of Friends but from what I remember it was nothing but half-attempted sex jokes. It did not seem funny at all 




 Yes. Although I suspect after Avengers 2 we're going to see the decline. I'm sure they were popular but I don't know too many people who watched the sequels to Capt. America, Thor, Spiderman, etc. 




 The difference is other out of state students probably are not paying out of their own pocket. I think everyone here would love for you to come to WSU but 100k out of undergrad would lead to a lifetime of debts and would not be worth it. WSU is fun but I'm sure the schools in Florida would be good too 




 Agreed. that is way more than a 40 lb difference. And looking like the left to the right in 4 months would be insane 




 It's a lot funnier with sound because he makes that horrible chalk screeching sound when he fixes the F 




 wifey girlfriend and mistress 




 Cuz I'm the Juggernaut biiiiitch 




 It's no joke. At this point I could go to McDonalds or few a couple more bucks I could go to any sit down restaurant and have a quality meal 




 At least they're already on a flammable surface for you 




 Correct! 




 Throwback to the skybridge nice 




 Yeah sorry my webcam pointed out the window isn't ideal 




 He's the one that isn't 21 yet 




 Nope guess again 














 My parents changed their home phone to one ring so it goes straight to voicemail. Do not know why they still bother with landlines 




 Put that little money into bitcoin. I can't imagine how rich I'd be now if I had done that 




 What's wrong with Kevin? He's nice and funny and seems like he would fit in if they didn't all hate him 




 Seriously. A lazy college student like me throws it all in the slow cooker then drunk me at 2 am already has chili  




 I found a full on skeleton costume at the thrift store so I bought it. Problem was it was meant for 10 year olds and I'm 6 ft. Still wore it though 




 Do you speak english motherfucker? 




 Ok so maybe 3-4 times is actually good for you. After that though 




 It's weird how perfectly flat the bottom of that is but every other part is fluffy  




 Who are we kidding there's no leaving this website 




 I smell a calzone! Costanza is in the building! 




 The opening scene to this is one of the funniest 




 He posted that shit 2 weeks ago. Which means he had the easiest case of cancer ever, he knew he was about to make a full recovery, or he's full of shit 




 Did some research. OP seems to post stuff in fantasy and writing subreddits. He's also the mod of r/shadestaff however it seems like a week old.  Looking up on Amazon the book came out about 6 months ago. Don't really have an opinion but these are the facts

Edit: I agree though that user has got to be an alt 




 I always kinda thought Ted's part in this was ridiculous. She reached for the check? I mean I know he seems to have some obsession with that as seen with the cat loving date pt. 2 girl but still. Beercules is awesome though 




 I just had war flashbacks to open labs 




 "Are you wearing mascara"

I am a guy

and no 




 I'll grow some kale. We need to be as organically hipster as possible 




 How else would they walk in to a porno? 




 I ensure that quality yet affordable products are well stocked at all times for the everyday working American and offer any answers to questions they may have. Aka, a sales associate at Walmart 




 I think every character had a good plot in this episode. I also really enjoyed Barney and Robins dance. It pretty much makes no sense but showing off their talent makes up for it. 

That scene at the beginning though with Ted and Marshal outside on the bench though. I kept waiting for that in Season 9 and it never happened, I didn't expect the same dialog but something to show it at least 




 every school ever 




 You can definitely tell there are far more viewers here than there are commenters. I almost feel bad because I reply to most the threads here but it would be nice to hear more people's opinions on things. Like other people said though there's less and less new ideas to be discussed 




 I always thought Marshal and Barney change the most. Seeing Marshal in Season 1 he looks like he's in college still, and Barneys face gets more defined wrinkles by the end. Robin and Ted hardly change at all IMO, and Lily "has statutory written all over her" 




 I had that exact car in high school. Super fun car to drive with the manual transmission and its turn radius is amazing 




 Wow, that's actually really subtle. Nice observation 




 Lol. And apparently 5 new bars in downtown, just found that out when I visited last week on spring break 




 Electricity doesn't just shoot out of outlets 




 There's good naked and then there's bad naked 




 I've been there before a couple times. There's not a worse feeling than knowing the next few hours are going to be really uncomfortable and you just want to leave that second 




 Someone get this man gold

Edit: Guess I prove my point from the downvotes 




 That's funny because Puyallup is a pretty decent suburb with not much crime at all 




 Same here it's kind of blowing my mind right now. I was really shocked to see Puyallup on the front of News 




 The person I know who's color blind goes out of his way every possible time to mention he's color blind. In class there will be a diagram with things labeled and different colors and every time he says "fuck you I"m colorblind!" Like yeah we get it now, you'd think he actually can't distinguish colors at all 




 Civil war when the government tries to ban firearms from the people 




 I always wonder how call of duty became more popular than MoH. The campain on the first 3 computer games from MoH were amazing 




 I thought that was only on the Oregon Trail 




 Lead a slave revolution? Become pharaoh?

 I figured she said that without knowing she made a famous Star Trek reference. Or this whole thing is made up, either way 




 "We're going to the bathroom, you guys figure out what we're doing next"

Of course us guys then proceed to make cool structures with our forks and knives 




 Well I do live in a college town, not much choice 




 Right? I've watched How i Met your mother since I was 19 and when I turned 21 I was pretty disappointed to find out that bars are super crowded, noisy to the point you cant hear anyone, and there's never a girl just sitting there waiting to be hit on

Found something similar but I had the same question 




 Banya! 




 Today, let my asshat be yourasshat :) 




 They say when you hit 14 in the 8th grade is when you really mature

 Yes. 




 I agree with this. Or the opposite happens where one or both people want to branch out and just need some space 




 True but that would be way less of a fine if anything 




 I practiced for a whole summer and still can't land that trick 




 r/unexpected? The only unexpected thing is that it's trending
