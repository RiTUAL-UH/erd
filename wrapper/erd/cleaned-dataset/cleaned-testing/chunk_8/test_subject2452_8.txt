 I should have mentioned the monitor off button. Whoever did this doesn't want you to disrupt the signal. 




 So you can see it too?! First nobody could see my posts and now this? Things keep changing and I don't know what's happening. I shouldn't have told you to go there. I don't know what will happen to you if you do.

If you havent read the first part of the story, I suggest you take a look at [part 1](http://redd.it/3dki98). What you're about to see (if you can even see it) might not make much sense otherwise. Im not sure how much sense it makes either way to be honest. I found something on this computer yesterday that shook me to my core.

Please tell me if you can go to:

I dont know if anyone can, and I dont know if anyone should. I didnt even know people could see my first post until recently.

 nbsp;

The link was just sitting there in a .txt file, tucked away in My Documents with a single line reading To help you scream at night. I didnt need to click on it. I shouldnt have. but what would you do, being trapped in a place like this? I said I wanted answers and I got them. I honestly cant tell if this is just a joke, or a pet project from someone at the radio station. Someone with time on their hands and a sickness, remedied only by their own grand delusions.

but I guess Ive recently developed some pretty awful delusions as well. Its been two weeks now, and aside from the stuff I mentioned in my first post, there hadnt been much activity until yesterday. I dont know if its the paranoia setting in after finding screamlouder.info, but Im seeing things now. Hearing things. Moving shadows in the abandoned remnants of homes, the sound of wind where I cant feel a single hair move above my head... 

And all your comments, Ill read them but sometimes they dont look right. Sometimes they sound wrong in my head. They scare me. Then I look again, and I understand that Ive received nothing but kind words and different methods to get out of here.

That reminds me, I tried to leave. It was 2 days ago. I thought there might be a path through the mountains somewhere. I packed a backpack full of food and supplies and made my way through the forest. After a mile or so, I came to a river. Completely black. The sludge blocked my way. 

I followed it all the way around town and back behind the cabin on the hill. Ive been on an island this whole time! I found a road leading to a bridge west of the radio station, but it had collapsed into the sludge below. I threw a log into the stuff at one point to see if I could swim through and it sank like itd fallen in tar. I imagined myself in place of the log, slowly sinking, deeper and deeper until the black ooze filled my lungs. I wept.

 nbsp;

 Im losing hope by the minute you guys, and I dont know how much more I can take. Worse than everything though, was last nights incident

 nbsp;

It was maybe 11 or 12 oclock at night and I couldnt sleep. Too many questions were buzzing in my head. I decided to go for a walk to clear my mind and get some air. Typically a fools choice this late at night, but strangely the electricity still works here and the street lights were lit up on all the poles that hadnt fallen. It provided me with sight and a sense of security. With or without light though, If it meant getting away from that computer room for awhile, Id take my chances.

Id just passed the street where I laid out some parking cones reminding me to stay away from that awful payphone, when I noticed a building that I must have seen a dozen times but never really bothered to look at. Through the windows I could see chrome rimmed tables and chairs, booth seating stretching from one end to the other, and framed pictures of places around town I could already identify (Im becoming too familiar with this place, god I want to leave). The sign above the building was brightly lit with some of the letters burnt out. Au_ie _ays Diner 
This must have been the diner from that website. I hated the thought of exploring unfamiliar territory after dark but I needed to make a connection, find some semblance of understanding in this place before I could sleep again. If this yokal restaurant had real answers waiting for me inside, nothing could keep me out.

The front door swung open effortlessly. Looks like the locking mechanism had been torn off in the storm. To my right in this darkened room was a lightswitch that, after several flicks from my hand, proved itself unusable.

 nbsp;

*click*

 nbsp;

The flashlight I took from my stash of emergency gear shot a stream of light at the kitchen behind the front counter. Hundreds of empty pie tins were stacked from floor to ceiling, covering every square inch of the room. Award winning pies was an understatement for this level of disarray.

Stumbling over broken plates and stray tins, I wandered into the hallway behind the counter in search of a circuit breaker. I kept my eyes forward and alert while I brushed my hand against the wall, hoping to catch the change from wallpaper to metal. Near the end of my path, I felt a wet spot. Shivers went down my spine as I shined the light on my fingers.

 nbsp;

**Black.**

 nbsp;

Hoping it wasnt what I thought it was, I brought my fingers to my nose and sniffed.

 nbsp;

It smelled like berries and corn syrup. Thank god, just pie filling.

 nbsp;

I shined my light over to the spot on the wall Id just touched, and noticed a crease in the wallpaper. I followed it up the wall and then over and down again. It was in the shape of a door.
Someone had sealed a room off from the rest of the diner.

Hundreds of pie tins crashed as I shuffled my way into the kitchen. I needed a knife to cut through the paper. I spotted one on the stove that was covered in pie filling. It seemed like thats all theyve been serving for a long time now.

I returned to the door, put down my flashlight, and dug the serving knife into the wall where the creases lay. As I dug, I noticed a flow of air from the room. It carried with it a sickly sweet smell. The scent of a secret decayed by neglect.

After I sliced through the perimeter, I felt for the spot where a knob should have been. Instead there was a hanging ring handle inlaid into the wood of the door. After cutting a hole, I grabbed the handle and pulled.

The inside was dark. I heard a drawn out gloop and squelch as something from the ceiling fell to the floor. I picked up my flashlight and peered inside. The walls and ceiling were coated inches thick in blackberry filling. It looked like week old coagulated blood, and it didnt smell much better. I held my shirt above my nose to keep from inhaling too much of it. I quickly shined my flashlight around the room and there in the back corner was a blob of flesh.

Man or woman I wasnt certain but they must have been five or six hundred pounds if not more. They sat there completely naked and lathered in pie filling, motionless against the wall. They must have added to the stench weeks or even months ago. It was a renaissance painting of the path to hell via gluttony.

 nbsp;

I stumbled backwards with dry, night-terror screams. I couldnt handle this, none of it made sense, and I needed to leave! NOW! but I couldnt feel my legs! I just stood there motionless in the dark, completely escaped from my body, repeating in my head *what the fuck is happening?!*

Then I caught my breath, eyes returned to focus, and I booked it without looking back. I screamed through the empty town, with no response but my own echoes off the nearby rubble. I ran up the stairs of the radio station, tripping over myself on the way. I hid in my bed for the rest of the night, eyes wide open peering through my sheets. unblinking.

That brings us to now. I knew this, more than ever, was when I needed to call for help again. I see your comments, I know youre out there...I just wish I knew you were real and not just in my head. I cant believe any of this!

How does a place like this exist and more importantly, who or what killed the person in that hidden room? I know I said I was lonely before, but now I pray more than anything that Im alone.

 nbsp;

I'm not ready to give up on leaving this place quite yet. I'll keep you all posted if anything else happens.
 




 please stay. 




 Thank you for the encouragment. I really need it right now. I'm not always sure if I'm alone anymore. I'll post more soon. P.S. naming the streets might be good, who knows how long I'll be here. Who knows how long I'll be alone. Please stay here.
