 anyone who upvoted his comment is already in jail 




 Maybe "worst" is the wrong word.  Most blatant, perhaps? 




 There was no nudity.  Why was this nsfw?  Got my hopes up for nothing. 




 HAIL SAGAN!

 This might actually be a race issue. 




 Rules that are left intentionally vague so that you can easily claim that it's up to interpretation.

you are fate was sealed.  

**YOU ARE.** 




 heh.  wood 




 Mention the ceo's husband and see what happens 




 You mean "benned" 




 If the rape is accidental, is it legitimate enough for the woman's body to shut down the pregnancy? 




 Ahh thanks for being a decent person. 









 that's probably the difference of 205 vs 185 you're looking at 




 ahh.  so then nothing to do with the romans as /u/zoicyte was stating? 




 Was the ottaman empire really an extension of Rome? I was Always under the impression that they were the successors to the islamic caliphate.

 Can we have Moreno if ya'll aren't gonna sign him? 




 It'll be *more* successful if they all contribute, though. 




 Inside the cage Sonnen was always a class act.  He never over celebrated. 




 How about a goal like not censoring default subs when content that you don't like gets voted up by the user base? 




 Don't feel bad, they got me when I was 28. 




 One of the better superhero movies out there. 




 As a former muslim, I can confidently say that Islam is exactly like that.  There is a very popular hadith that pretty much itemizes how one gets into heaven.  

First, you have to physically and outwardly be religious.
If you can't accomplish that, you must at least be inwardly religious and god fearing.
If you can't do that or are another religion, there's still hope!!  All you have to do is believe in the one-ness of god, regardless of what name you call him by.
If you can't accomplish this, perhaps missionaries were unable to reach you with the holy message in time, then you can still get into heaven.  All you have to do is have an ounce of goodness in you. (pretty vague, right?)

So, not so unique, eh? 




 I don't know...this doesn't feel like he's trying that hard.

 LEG KICKS DON'T WIN FIGHTS, BRUH 




 Way to go out on a limb and make a bold statement, Luke. 









 look how highly upvoted everything is 




 Lyoto vs. Shogun part 1.  That shit was a striking clinic in which both fighters represented their fighting styles in the best possible way, and did their schools justice. 




 Murica! 




 What's the difference between annulment and divorce? 




 Nice 




 CNN is the biggest joke in journalism. I wonder how blitzer and his ilk are able to show their faces in public and proudly call themselves journalists. 



















 That's her problem, not Honda's 




 Thank god. 




 It's as if he watched the south park episode about his shitty movies, and a year later decides that it would be genius to make that very movie. 




 Why would you spit it out just because it was in her butt?  It's gonna end up in your butt anyway. 




 My greatest achievement? 




 I wonder how many people Hitler actually killed with his own hands. 




 So far.... 




 Jesus man, that got dark quick 




 different frames of the same video?  brilliant! 




 Look up the "you're with me, leather" story. Also the suspensions that ESPN handed out when anyone ever mentioned the phrase "with leather" 




 God damn.  I might be the only person who loves Daron's voice.  Scars on Bradway are brilliant.

But yes, Serj is the master. 




 That's like a mountain being taller than Everest.

 Jesus, had to scroll all the way to the bottom for this. 




 yeah dynasty.  I guess that settles that.  Just saw that Corbin is 5 years younger 









 Honestly that was kind of my attitude in making the post. 




 Dammit 




 directed by the same people? 




 Really a toss-up here. 




 I think we can infer the story behind the pic without additional reading.  But thanks. 




 Did not know that. 




 Well, the likelihood of two T-Rexes fighting over a cantaloupe are higher than a woman giving virgin birth to the son of a diety who happens to be that diety, but is somehow separate from the child, so... 




 Man, there are a lot of Golf one hit wonders.  Guys who won a major and then did nothing.  Zach Johnson and Trevor Immleman come immediately to mind. 




 Todd Kaye.  America History X.

The guys who did Blair Witch.

The guy who did City of God.

Did Billy Bob direct Slingblade?

Edit: Tony, not Todd. My bad.
Also, I didn't know the Constant Gardener was directed by the same person who did City of God. Both fantastic films. One hit wonder status rescinded. 




 This is one where I think RT got it wrong.  The Rock and Sarah Michelle Gellar were excellent in it.  The movie wandered at times, but it's not a 36% movie. 




 JD Salinger.  Catcher in the Rye.

Arthur Golden.  Memoirs of a Geisha.

Margaret Mitchell.  Gone with the Wind.

Edit:  I get it, Salinger wrote many books.  I'm wrong on him.

Edit2: but really, does anybody remember vanilla ice's other songs? 




 To go with that, Paul Hogan.  Crocodile Dundee. 




 This is like a broke ass Stanford Prison Experiment, but with rats, and less quality control, and weak sample size.

 Probably most of the heavier ones, simply due to conditioning.  Yes, they are all cardio monsters, but in a 5 round war, if you know you are up, it just makes too much sense to coast.  Especially the heavier guys, who's opponensts have shit tons of power and any slip up could land your ass flat on the mat. 




 I'm ok with that, even as a JJ hater. 




 only assholes.  far people are th fucking greatest. 




 Found the Jew! 




 lol, get more 90s and generic with your porn searches.  When you want specific niche stuff, migrate to bing.  You might as well be at a public library with google's weak shit. 














 jet fuel can't melt trees 




 Google nerfed their nsfw searches, brah.  Get with the times. 




 So, there's no context/background/details whatsoever.  Just dumbass jokes all the way down.

 




 Obama did it, bro!  What are you, a bitch? 




 I don't think Rodon is unexpected.

 The video is private 




 They always end with Sugar.  Also holy shit, they played Spiders. 




 That 80's action movie music montage.  Nice. 




 OK, as long as we have your reassurance, I feel better. 




 This game made me realize how other-worldly JJ really is.  Never really watched too much of him, just paid attention via fantasy sports.  That man is ridiculous. 




 oh you 




 I like how this one got more upvotes than the one on /r/Tinder  



















 could you expand on that? 




 Reddit is just two guys trolling each other with multiple alt accounts. 




 Lyoto walks around at that weight now.  When he moved down to middle weight, he said he was going for a permanent weight loss to make the cut to 185 easier.  I truly believe he should fight at WW.  And have always believed that.  He clearly has better dicsipline than Rumble or Hendricks, so being out of shape between fights would never be an issue for him. 









 I have been defeated. 




 Doesn't GSP cut from 200 down to welterweight?  Hendricks?  Look how big Rory is in this pic.  It's not impossible. 




 God dammit, Lyoto. 




 This is not considered "calling out" 




 hence, the title 




 And there's Machida, trying to walk around at his fighting weight.  Why won't he do a drastic weight cut like these guys, and fight people who are actually his size, like welterweights? 




 Ahh, the old accidental but on purpose posting a long winded answer in the "wrong" thread for karma 




 so sexy 




 poor bastard

 Damn.  What a sad reality.  I did not even think about that.  I was simply thinking in sheer numbers, that the percentages would play out in favor of catching a high profiler.  But their access to wealth and power completely excludes them from that group. 




 You think any famous journalist these days is willing to admit a mistake? 




 I will give everyone in this reply gold if he answers honestly, and not just some stupid schill answer.  If any answer at all. 




 If that was true, you should have landed at least one high profile member of society. 




 You will not receive a reply in this fluff AMA 




 At least 8 of those holes are mine.

 so then you didn't watch season3 then? 




 Milfs.  Now that man knows how to party. 




 I dont know what you just said 




 Some strip clubs in the states let your hands roam free.  In one club I went to, it is a generally accepted rule that you can finger the stripper while she gives you a handjob.  That's called the "club's handshake".  At other clubs, you can negotiate blowjobs and fucking if the private dance area is discrete enough. 




 She probably should not have said that. 




 What the fuck?  It says that this company was busted for serving rotten food at the stadium before, and they fucking keep them? 














 That would be hilariously bad.
