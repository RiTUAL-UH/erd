 I agree. But I loved the cross-over episodes! I just found Angel to be to brooding. 




 Ha, ha my first name is Devlin but I figured that I'd put my username. 




 Okay, thank you :) 




 So what does this have to do with the mandela effect? 









 When I was a kid my family and I moved to the countryside. For the first four years we lived in a small town which was fine but we eventually moved, quite litterally to the middle of nowhere. It was this one street town with like 4 houses. It was ok because I spent most of my time indoors anyway (I've always been indoors-ey).
The house we were living in was big, much bigger than anything I had ever stayed in before (before we moved to the countryside we lived in a suburban area of a city with a pretty big home, then a small town, then the middle of nowhere). Most of the bedrooms were upstairs but there was one down stairs. Everytime you went in it it was cold, when I say cold I mean it felt like ice, you could always see your breath. So, as a rule, I stayed out of there. The rest of the house was awesome and my brothers and sisters and I had a pretty cool time living there but I started getting horrible feelings whenever I went near the cold room:
My eyes would water like I was going to cry, I would get a sore chest. I always tried to keep myself calm by explaining to myself that it was just me, I got a sore chest because of my asthma, I had watery eyes because of some other reason I'm sure I found less than convincing.
The part that gets creepy was when our kitchen was being remodeled. Because of the layout of the kitchen we had to move the fridge into the cold bedroom untill the remodelling was finished. I couldn't stand going in there and eventually I straight out refused. You see I spend a lot of time with my two dogs (who were younger at the time) since I'm almost always inside and whenever they went near that room they would show their teeth and raise their hackles, which they virtually never do.
One night I fell asleep and had this nightmare. In it I went into the room to get something as fast as I possibly could but then the door slammed shut and I couldn't open it for the life of me. On the other side my brother was trying to force it open. Then this man appeared he was clothed in a huge black cloak and started mumbling words I couldn't make out before he started choking me. I woke up coughing like mad and had, what I call, a "mini" asthma attack. I told my mum the next morning and she starred as if looking through me not at me. Then she said:
'XboxG4mer I had the exact same dream'
She never wanted to freak me out so straight away she comforted me by telling me it was just a dream. I kept having the same nightmare and I never asked her but I think my mum did too because after a couple of months we moved away.
The man in the dream was old but looked wholly evil. I don't know what happened in that house but there was something about that room. Nothing could warm it and the eery sensations I got when near it were stronger than any I've ever felt. 




 The protagonist(s) survive the impossible. 









 Eeh that's the subreddit for the show. 




 Ha, ha okay 




 I like that too. I don't live in the states so it's nice to speak to others that do. Or anywhere else really. 









 I used to bite my nails a lot. The best thing you can do is cut them with scissors or nail clippers and keep them short by cutting regularly that way you won't be able to bite them and eventually you won't want to because you'll be used to keeping them short using other means.  




 Awesome I'll check it out :) 




 Awesone I just messaged you :) 




 I'll invite you too a group and we can meet at the shrine in the rift. 




 Awesome if you're on now I'll do it :) 









 Orange is the new black. Oh my god amazing show can't wait for s4. 




 Love it! What did you think of the ending? I called it years ago and when I was right I felt kinda sad. I did like the ending though it was realistic. 




 Angel isn't nearly as good imo. I always found him to brooding. 




 Ha, ha one month! Amateur, week and a half here. I watched them wiithout stopping except for the wee hours of sleep that I got. 




 Username: DevlinFr3w99 

I'm up for talking about xbox, gaming, books, music, tv and movies.  




 Awesome! You're so lucky! 




 It's a matter of opinion. It's a difficult game which is good imo but the world doesn't pull me in like other games. I had fun with it but in my opinion it's not that great but I can see why some people like it. 




 Not buried, I read it :) 









 Try and draw a a sexy female poo, with long brown hair, glasses and a little black or red dress.

***EDIT 1:*** So a few of you said I should look into it and see what I can find. When I did a quick google of the street it turned up nothing and gave me the names of nearby locations. I'll update again soon.

***EDIT 2*** So I found it on the googs (sounds weird, google sounds better). However it only spoke about how the "village" once had a larger population, a school and a train station etc but after the coal mining industry in the area was done many people moved and full streets lay empty. I knew all of this and when I say full streets I mean like 15 houses maybe 20, barely anyone lives there today. 




 Wow. That's an awesome story. Kudos to you and your brother for keeping calm. Is he still serving? Have you since gone camping in that area?  




 How many steps have I taken in my entire life? 

How many people have there been since the dawn of time? 




 Don't ever talk about tucking snails! They're evil and terrifying! 




 Free will. I wondered about this a long time ago and aske  my self even though I technically could do anything I want is that my fate? To end up wherever I do because of what I do. So for a while I just did completely random, out of the ordinary things. I don't see any special results. Nothing monumental, good or bad happened and I don't see how it could lead me to my fate. We can do whatever we want. 




 It's a choice you can make just tell her your views on the matter. 




 I don't know about where you live but here it's a choic you can make when you turn eleven, regardless of what your parents say. 




 This is just a re-post of that post that said the same thing about the tallest person. It's kind of sad what people will do for karma. Also they might not have been since they may have been born fat and never experienced a skinny lifestyle. 




 No he wasn't. There would've been babies who were born that were smaller than him at birth. 









 How about we get married, in Summer, in a church in Antarctica? Then we jump into our sled pulled by dogs and go on a magical ride to Hawaii where we can enjoy our honeymoon? 




 Woohoo! We'll get married in winter in a church. You have to make me feel loved. 




 I'll do it for free in exactly 13 hours 24 minutes and 16 seconds if you're on the EU server 




 Marry me! 




 History. I could talk about it forever. I'm also deeply passionate about books and gaming. 




 It sounds really dangerous. Microwaves aren't safe when they have faults. They can cause various problems. I don't know exactly what's happening with your microwave but I definitely recommend that you get a new one.  




 Get rid of it and buy a new one, that sounds extremely dangerous.  




 Good for you, I never used socks but I now have tissues since joining 




 Aaw, that's too bad. 




 You are a good man. 




 I just want to say, I don't intend on trying it but I'm just curious. Please don't say 2/3 times. 




 After you eat anything wash the bowl/plate etc. It stops dishes from piling up.

Empty the trash frequently and taking shoes off at the front door is a good rule if you have carpets. 

Set aside a couple of hours one day a week and wash your windows and doors etc.

I realise they were more about keeping it clean. As for organisation:

Keep things in certain places. You keep your clothes in your wardrobe and dishes in the cupboard so do the same thing and set certain locations for certain things. 

A good I dea is a coat rack. Some can be bought that are pretty nice and they stop jackets from piling up.

 




 It is Harold. 




 Good for you man. Society does justify it way to much. Just cause it's "normal" doesn't make it good, slavery was once normal and so was burning people for being witches. I'm not comparing these three things just making a point. I've had a few times were I've made it for weeks but as far as porn goes I went months without it... untill recently. I still don't regret it though because I now know more than ever that I don't enjoy it or want to see it. Good luck friend. 




 Im a vorarephiliac. It involves people being eaten etc. You can read about it [here.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorarephilia) 




 I think I was around ten. We enjoyed the entire day and in the night she came to see us. We were playing with our new toys and she asked if we had a good day? We answered "aye" (from Scotland :) ) we spoke for a while about how fun they were and then she told us gently. I can't remember exactly what she said but she did it right cause weren't upset or angry. At the time we were beggining to question Santa's motives for bringing us free stuff (kidding but we were at the age were you question his authenticity).  




 Yeah, I'm in a large group of people who roleplay as werewolves, we take it pretty seriously. There are even larger ones that do all sorts of things you just have to find them. 




 Green. Or bumpy. 




 When she figured we were getting to old my mum sat me and my twin down on christmas night and explained gently to us. It went really well and we understood. She did the same thing with my older siblings. 




 My sister's friend's cousin's girlfriend's mum's friend's nephew was in a photo of some sort that was used to represent some sort of product somewhere. 




 Yeah people on the internet always lie, I also have a 11" dick. Really!


If everyone that had said that did then the average would be 11" and it wouldn't be so special. 




 I saw it in a Matthew Santoro video on youtube. 









 Yeah, fun game. Don't get me wrong I like pc gaming but I just prefer consoles. 




 You are an extremely gifted writer. Most TIFU post with anything even remotely similar are people complaining or trying, and failing, to be funny. You made me laugh so much while I was reading. I hope your, eh little you, gets better fast. 




 Well it's better than playstation and I don't enjoy pc gaming. 




 I see them as a people with a nice cultural background who are often taken advantage of by other ethnic groups. 




 No. Even if the answer was yes, I would say aye. 




 Ha, ha oh my god that was great! Did you make it? If so well done. 




 All the time on xbox. I'm Scottish so I'm always asked if I wear kilts, have ginger hair, drink whiskey etc. 




 By British you probably mean English. I'm Scottish (technically British) and I can't stand those people or their terrible jokes. 




 What you have to first understand is that the government cannot just print money as it needs to have a value. Here in Scotland our money is worth sterling. So if we wanted we could go to a bank and request sterling (but no one does). Instead of everyone carrying said sterling we carry notes to represent them. 


So the government, here can print depending on the amount of sterling we have. If they print beyond what we have inflation occurs and prices rise. This was a major issue in Weimar Germany 1923 and again in 1929. 

So to answer your question: Governments can and should print within what they have, depending on what the currency represents.  




 Around a decade ago NASA sent a space probe, called new horizons, on a journey. It is now closer to Pluto than any man-made object has ever been and can take much better photographs than our current technology allows via the use of telescopes.  




 I do this but don't suck in too much :) 




 The breeze (Brianna) from the "GONE" [series](http://www.michaelgrantbooks.co.uk/gone/) by Michael Grant.


She and I were around the same age when I read it (14) and she was everything I liked in a girl. Long(ish) Brown hair, witty, smart, a little bit cocky. She was just an awesome, well written character and then...

***SPOILER ALERT***


































They killed her off in the most inhumane way possible! I still cry at night. (Joking) but seriously she was awesome.
 









 There's a very good theory that bypasses all of that. It's a bit far fetched but possible. 




 Good luck OP. Maybe it has something to do with your old arrowhead shaped rock. If you still have that I wouldn't throw it away. I would go back to the tunnel you mentioned at the first chance I got and leave it there. Either way stay safe.
 




 Wow, weird. To me it sounds like she was killing them and taking different parts of each mens body together to make one "perfect man". 




 I know it's late but I made it to the front page of askreddit and got over 10,000 messages and I can't clear them all or read my actual messages from other posts! 




 I know right! 




 I know I'm late but hopefully you will read this. First of all I'm sorry you guys can't have children. I think you should tell your mum to stop torturing you and your wife. I know it's not an easy thing to do, trust me it's not, but maybe you should give her an ultimatum. Tell her it's not Claires fault she can't have children and if she doesn't give you both a sincere apology and stop upsetting you both then you want nothing to do with her. I know that sounds like a terrible thing to say to her but she will most definitely choose you and I know it will cause friction and tension but another option is that you sit down with her and Claire and explain that adoption is in no way evil and tell her she needs to stop, this is no one's fault. 




 I love these so much!!!!!!!! 




 Aaaaagh Felix!! :D How much? Honestly how much?! 




 Ha, ha she's gorgeous! 









 Wow, all I can say is good luck and I hope you do complete it and manage to compete. 




 Ha, ha what a great and inspirational man. 




 I saw it. I like that one. 




 Ha, ha nice one. 




 I would replace it with [this.](https://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=76RrdwElnTU) 




 Jafar from Aladdin. Sure he seems evil but if you think about it he is trying to save the kingdom from the idiot sultan who doesn't even notice the widespread poverty and famine in his own kingdom... and he's also trying to become an evil dictator but what's a little dictation amongst friends? 




 Ha! :D 




 That's a nice quote. You might've been late but I still read it :) 




 Yeah, no. 




 It doesn't have to just be in eso it can be from arena-daggerfall-morrowind-oblivion-skyrim-eso (also redguard and battlespire). 




 Yeah, no. 




 Either way I love him. He was so funny and during the planemeld he wanted to stop it, not to save nirn, but to "save" coldharbour from getting to much like tamriel.  




 I remember reading that post, sad for the guy but at least he probably inspired others to not make the same mistakes. 




 Me too :) 




 Ha, ha this made me laugh. 




 Wow good job :) (Not being sarcastic, seriously nice words). 




 I honestly can't remember who said it but I remember reading:


I am not a a pessimist for they look at the world with negative views and thoughts. Nor am I an optimist for they look at the world and often try and see the good where there is none. I am a realist. I am happy when things are good and face the hard times when they arrive. 


It wasn't that exactly but it was something like that. 




 I'm actually studying history and I love that quote, along with:

"History is not history, unless it is the truth":- Abraham Lincoln. 




 Ha, ha I used to, scrap that, I do love Rugrats! 




 WT?! 




 Ha, ha the end made me laugh :) I like that quote too. 




 Ha, ha this made me laugh. 




 I'll be back... to write some more Arnie quotes with you later and you better do it! 




 I like that :) 




 Okaaaaay. 




 Wai- wait what?! I blew up?! AAAAAGH!! :D I don't really use facebook. I have it but... meh. 




 Okaaaay. 




 I ***LOVE*** Mass Effect, great games, great quote :) 




 I think that's also the Nike slogan :) 




 I like that and I have to say, as a fellow gamer, I don't think it's wasting time. You're socializing, having fun and even though you might not realize it you learn quite a lot from videogames.  




 Ha, ha I might not have the power but I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs... I play video games aswell! As a fellow gamer with virtually no right to say this... I declare the above quote to be under permanent ownership by /r/Lizardizzle 




 Aaa thanks! 




 ***EDIT 1*** Wow! I just woke up and this post blew up!! Thank you all!! :D 




 Life would look bad since we see in much higher "fps" (of course life doesn't have frames but you know what I mean)
