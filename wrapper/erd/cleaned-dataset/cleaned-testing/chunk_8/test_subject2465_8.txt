 Why didn't this happen to Andrew Wakefield? 









 The Quran is VERY anti-gay.

Live you life, but don't just twist a blatant lie to help your case. 




 From the past? He's LITERALLY one of the most influential people of the last 100 years. 






















































 AND the video is unlisted.  




 Not entirely.

Geopolitics is unpopular but its definitely a problem that will never be hidden by ignoring it. The USA thinks it needs that leverage internationally.  




 he shits on TV a LOT for someone who stays on it 









 The man has argued in front of the Supreme court himself. He's not stupid 




 So this is going to go down like gay marriage, huh?

 Sayyid Qutb says hello 




 Are you really telling me you fell into the mythology that he was REALLY that honest? The man hated black people and pretended not to.

 I always wonder what these laws mean or how they're enforced because it seems like its pretty easy to cross the line and not know it...or maybe I don't understand.  




 The cords on these are retarded.  




 g'luck 




  Logitech UE900 cable 

mine just started to short out at the 3.5mm end. Absolutely drives me insane. 

barely 6 months 




 I believe it's similar to the situation in Russia. Putin too intelligent and worldly to be as personally religious and homophobic as his policies and statements reflect, but the Russian people are something like 80% orthodox and not too fond of the gays, and he's ultimately culpable to their opinions.
 

if you saw the last season of House of Cards, the russian leader kinda reminds me of what you're implying.  














 or to make sure your DSLR wasn't a gun 




 Whose rights were taken away here?  




 You can't be POTUS for 8 years and be perfect 




 Obama won 




 Well the only reason KSA is so screwed is BECAUSE of the schism between the religious rulers and the royal family 




 any chance it has a mic? 




 SEVEN CHURCHES HAVE BURNED IN THE AREA IN THE LAST WEEK

http://www.npr.org/2015/06/29/418490411/arsonists-hit-6-black-churches-in-5-southern-states 




 Yeah. WHITE people. 




 Are you fucking stupid? 

The KKK burned down the same church in 1995. Bill Clinton even viewed the site in 1996: https://youtu.be/z4g27k499Cs

SEVEN black churches have burned in the last week. The ATF is going nuts right now.

 




 White supremacists are upset. 

The KKK burned down the same church in 1995. Bill Clinton even viewed the site in 1996: https://youtu.be/z4g27k499Cs 




 You dumbass

**Do you know ANYTHING about the history of burning black churches in the USA? Or ANYTHING about white supremacist terrorism on black people?**

 Don't worry, Reddit says race isn't a factor anymore 














 Well will look at this? 

I'm sure the Putin-ites are shocked 









 Are you American?

I need to know before I answer this 




 What sort of pseudoscience is this? 



















 Theres TONS of factors.  




 This is going to massively shift radio for small artists.  




 How would you even determine if there was a correlation?

It seems like a stupid question to even investigate.  




 This is the same thing that led to recalls 




 wha? How? carbon fiber? gravity?

Are you a wizard? 




 I bet you think the WTC shouldn't have collapsed either 




 They ALL deserve it 




 She's a beaver who lives in bikini bottom 




 It is for many people. 














 And France will never have a culture of innovation. But hey, whatever suits them 




 Do you realize how NOTORIOUS France is for being anti-business? They wouldn't even compromise! And this place pretends to be a leading nation? 

Whoever is in charge of interacting with companies like Uber could have avoided this  




 Lets not pretend that France isn't notorious for not "seeing the future" if you will, and effectively standing in the way of such progression by way of taking chances.  




 I believe it does, even though I don't support it. 




 I don't see it as far fetched that inspired people take their inspirations to the next level. 




 Why is mental illness your cop-out?  




 He really almost got away 




 I did not support the Iraq War 




 This highlights the culture of innovation that a lot of other nations don't have.

Uber could ONLY have been invented in places like the USA. France has got to be one of the most anti-business places ever.  




 Why is it only a problem when the US conducts espionage?

Are we supposed to just sit back and lose leverage around the world while everyone turns an eye to other nations doing it?

I don't feel guilty for the US being powerful.  




 If France wasn't selling war-ships to russia, then we wouldn't have to do that. 

I see no foul here.  




 its just a rug 




 This is why the US is the innovation capital...and France isn't. 




 Amazing 




 Bloomberg is really turning the tide... 









 Uh...what the hell? 
























 They're like the largest spenders and STILL can't defeat some ragtag rebels on their border 




 This show is going to stick. 




 Is it even possible for him to successfully accomplish any of some of the talking points he makes frequently? 




 Those are huge

 This.

If I want to use my data to stream a podcast that got released 2 minutes ago, I shouldn't have to be on WIFI to do it.  




 They rioted because the cops killed a dude for no reason. 




 Buzzfeed has been doing VERY well with original content.  




 Greece is in a...slippery situation... 



















 Redwing. Period. 




 And he didn't even quote Michelle Alexander who wrote the book: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow

bastard 




 ...huh? 









 NY in general needs more train lines...anything over 1/3rd of a mile from a stop is unacceptable.  




 True, but they're probably the only people who end up affording this stuff.  









 racism isn't just the n-word. Its attitudes and behaviors.  




  The fact of the matter is that black unemployment is not institutionalize racism.

False. 

Red-lining did more to harm the black community than you'll ever understand.

There are systematic efforts to keep minorities out of certain communities and thus certain jobs.

Racism didn't just disappear overnight dumbass 




 Handling white supremacy IS a big deal. Lets not pretend that it just magically went away 




 I can't think of a more costly mistake to be recorded by Russian intelligence services and released showing US interests in overthrowing the Ukrainian president that led to the present situation that places Russia and the USA back in another cold war.  




 its not even cute...I bet its super heavy  









 so basically, make it up as you go along?
 




 Democracy isn't really meant for everyone 









 http://www.vox.com/2015/6/26/8849925/obama-obamacare-history-presidents 









 lulz 














 Lilly Ledbetter? 

ACA?

Gay rights? DOMA? DADT?

Fairer sentencing? 

Shifting drug enforcement policy?  




 Obama opposed gay marriage to get elected. He's supported it since 1996: http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0109/Obama_backed_samesex_marriage_in_1996.html 














 The sheer number of wins he's racked up over the course of these last two years have been incredible...is he on the track to have one of the best legacies of any president ever? 

EDIT: http://www.vox.com/2015/6/26/8849925/obama-obamacare-history-presidents 




 did you see that video of that guy in Atlanta who takes loaded AR-15s into the airport under the guise of "self protection" just to troll cops?  





























 ...don't push it. 




 How wrong is this article? 

The flag that has since been adopted has roots in these very ideals.  





























 Well then we'd have to get rid of Florida, Alabama, NC, TN, and AR as well 









 Put it in a museum. Why do we honor traitors?  




 how? 




 *Dzhokhar be kidding me!* 




  I don't think the issue is racist hiring practices (it's more likely a poverty/education disparity) but it shows that we've still got aways to go before people are really afforded the same opportunities.

Do you really think this? 



















 he had no choice. 

every major retailer jumped ship 














 did it affect his care? 




 SJWs?

Wheres your Nazi flag then? 









 this doesn't mean what you think it does 














 This, but theres not even an option for it to adjust what counts as "played"

 China and Russia make sure they don't fall TOO far behind  




 Hillary is pretty terrible 




 At least credit Obama:

 Job well done. 




 I play a lot of songs in public for people but its hard to know what I exactly played and when...and when I go back and try to figure it out, its hard to remind people of what I actually played or make lists for them.

Is there a way to skirt this issue and create a temporary playlist or enable a certain column ranking option?  




 yeah, but it doesn't show the order of songs you played  




 What do you mean?

 its always the 1%, huh? 

Its never white supremacy and inherent racism, right? 














 I love it. I'm all in 




 Meanwhile China doesn't have a TPP...it just takes what it wants. 




 Do you know any black people?

Are you black?

Do anti-black terrorist groups that are over 100 years old not bother you?
