 Thank you everyone for the great responses! 




 Being french, it hurts me :'( 




 I somewhat understand this, but please tell me what 'capex' means :p 




 I am very disappointing by Arianespace. It existed for such a long time, but is partly government owned and depends on subsidies. SpaxeX started out solo, and has grown successful due to innovation and efficiency. Now Arianespace is begging for more subsidies. 

If europe's space industry is to grow large, it needs more competition, more businesses aiming for efficiency, and broad government subsidies, not targeted at specific companies. 




 Hey r/rocketlaunches,

This is my first post here as I just recently started to be interested in this. Im only 17 and did basic Physics (and Chemistry, both IGCSE Physics Higher Level for those familiar. Got 93% in science.), and now pursue other subjects.

So with my limited knowledge, could you please tell me where to start off when learning about the physics behind launching rockets, how rockets work, how SpaceX is making them more efficient price and mass wise, what are the main issues with launching rockets now, as well as travel to Mars (radiation and other problems to maintain a crew to the red planet).

Are there articles, videos, maybe even books, that I should start reading? Thank you very much, I look forward to learning anything and everything! :D 




 :'( 




 Thank you. I expect more mistakes to come.  




 Hey r/mapporn!
To commemorate the end of the war, here are maps that show the events unfolding. Please tell me any inaccuracies! I want to note I did this unrelated to Mapporn and throughout a rather long time period, so the quality is inferior to my expectations.

http://imgur.com/a/JzU3O

Key: I did not think of it as being crucial considering everyone knows about world war 2, but here it is:

Blue: Allies

Dark light blue: UK

Light light blue: occupied allied* territory and colonies

Dark dark blue: France

Light dark blue: occupied french territory and colonies

Red: USSR and allies

Dark red: USSR

Light red: occupied soviet territory

Axis: Grey

Dark grey: Nazi Germany

Medium grey: German allies

Light grey: Axis occupied territory

Blue arrows: allied movements

Red arrows: soviet movement

Black arrows: axis movement

*Allies: includes all shown on map, USA, other colonies and dominions, and post-liberated France.

Again, I want to apologise for the low quality, I did not mean to do them to post them here.Furthermore, please find any mistakes, I am sure there are many! I want to apologise in advance for the lack of Lake Lagoda, lack of consistency in the shades and again for the poor camera quality.

 Exactly. 




 But look at the long term graph. Even if it had a higher value, its rise is so extreme it will crash before growing higher. Is my reasoning flawed? 




 That's why I emphasised how my analysis is based on so much more. Sorry for not being clear enough. But thanks for telling me nonetheless. 




 That should be a quote! When was the last time you invested in something? 




 Detailed and logical answer. I am curious however, is looking at fundamentals of the economy a reliable way to analyse the stock market? The stock market reflects the confidence in an economy, and may (usually) has wide discrepancies with the quality of underlying firms, and an even wider discrepancy with the fundamentals of the economy. There is also irrational emotions of the masses to consider.

You certainly are more knowledgeable than me, I am just curious. 




 Great answer! Never thought of that. So what are you doing now? Are you just waiting for the dip? 




 Im the OP, and thanks for all the great answers. Still would love to continue reading this great debate. I personally had a small question: if I were to keep cash, should I just keep it or buy short term government bonds in countries that have no chance* to collapse?

*Yes yes, I know. You know what I mean. 




 Its okay guys, im in Paris XD 




 :D Criticism is always welcome. I'm already subscribed to both :) 




 Thanks 




 Thanks for the great answer. But I couldnt help but mention that France has the glorious euro. 




 Great response. Thank you. 




 Thank you for your response. 




 Thanks. Was always curious. 




 At least 40% :'( 
Being 17 and doing this small time, what are the chances of gettting caught and what consequences will occur if I don't pay it?
