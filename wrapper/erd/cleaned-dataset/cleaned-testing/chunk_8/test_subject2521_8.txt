 I am in the process of completing courses to apply to the School of Psychology. As of today, I have three courses (all in psychology) and need a suggestion on what to enroll in to fill that extra slot. If the art department allowed for students to take one measly class, I'd be set, but they don't, and now I'm left trying to decide on a class. 

Suggestions? 




 Sex trafficking. 

KCMO is the 2nd largest city for trafficking both men and women.  




 If it was accessed via a VPN, or other services, there's nothing they can really do.  









 After running in to my Senior year English teacher a few years back, I told him that I had read spark notes for almost every book he had assigned. After rereading them in college, it was a shame I didn't understand that level of reading just a few years prior. 


































 I enjoyed the park during the early to late 90s, but it went down hill after that.  




 8th grade class trip back in middle school was to Joyland. After going on the water ride, I smelt like sewage. It was so gross. Plus I looked as white as a ghost after riding the rollercoaster.

Never missed the place after that visit.  














 One step in education, one giant ~~step~~ leap for the State of Kansas. 

 














 Not sure how many people pay attention to the classifieds section of the Kansan, but that's always an option.

Don't forget Craiglist. Always a last resort site.

 My now fianc told me he didn't like who I became while drunk and out at bars (we were out together for a friends birthday). I stopped going out with friends to get drunk. It was a huge wakeup call for me and a sign that I needed to grow up.  




 There's a Hot Box where I live. The lady delivering our order got lost along the way and called me on my cell as she was wondering down the street trying to find our house 

It was the only one with outdoor lights on. She acted like she was high as fuck.  









 For those of us who didn't vote for Brownback we are free to express our opinions... 




 For all of the years I lived in Newton, I never experienced a storm quite like that.  




 Tapped the documentary goes in to full detail about this....

 Who said anything about minorities? 




 I meant the city in general, not the high school.  





























 Looks like a giant mushroom of death.  




 KS is prime territory for sex slaves, drugs, and violence due to the direct route via the interstate down to Mexico.  




 There are two KC's...KCKS and KCMO. 




 Understandable, but this would be of a huge concern for people living in cities such as Wichita, KC and the surrounding areas.


 














 Other states are still looking towards the idea of passing similar bills. 

If it the action that the state of KS has taken is considered invalid, what makes those states think they can do the same thing?

Also, what federal law does this go against? (I'm not much of a history buff)



 




 Blackfoot Indian Chief in full gear, waiting for white man to stand up and turn around. 


Wearing those clothes weren't and still aren't everyday attire. Fucking racists and their technologies of the olden days.  




 You're kidding, right? 




 Ice cream man

The stereotypical pedophile with a twist. Dudes are fucking creepy, even as an adult. If you decide to get some sweet treats this summer, never let them see you walk home, take a different route back. 

Same goes for carnies.

Edit: words 



















 Do you work through a temp agency? 

If so, it should state on your contract and weekly time sheet that your employer is required to provide you with a lunch break or other breaks.

 Fellow Pinckney resident here! 

A few shady homes and loud neighbors, but all and all, a great neighborhood. 

Best bet in finding a place would be to drive around the area and see what is for rent. There are a few apartment complexes - two of which are owned by the same family - and they are always an option if a home is not available. 
 




 Thanks for using the 'dd' and not the 'tt'....as in Paddy's not Patty's.

I am not Irish and it is still annoying.  




 Every bar on Mass. 

Any drinking related day/ holiday + a college town = a lot of specials.

The Replay Lounge has live music all day and 'green beer' (PBR or another cheap beer with green food dye) 




 He's part cat. 




 Decided I'd check and see if I could find Founders beer via their site.

Of all the US states that sell Founders, for once I'm happy I live in Kansas.

Too bad the liquor stores are an hour away and I rarely drink.
 




 There's  flu epidemic of sorts throughout the State of Kansas and the U.S..... 




 The problems on the quiz were vocab words relating to the US Constitution. My boss and I spent days asking him the differences between Federalist and Antifederalist, the Bill of Rights and dozens of other vocab words. 

When assigned reading material, we switch off by reading aloud to him and then he'll read a paragraph or two...that requires almost a weeks work and he often still can't comprehend what was read unless we create a graph, table, ect. so that he can make sense of all of the information. 




 I need to read through his IEP and see if I can get a better idea. There is a lot to know about each student and I am starting to get a better idea as of what I should do.

This is my second month working with students at the high school. 




 I am neither one. I am in the process of completing undergraduate work before applying to graduate school. 




 Yes, I know. You are not the first to point that out. 




 He doesn't want to go to college.  




 Got the memo already.  




 I did not expect a lot of karma. Just wanted to share. I was so proud of the student and hoped other people would see that motivation really helps.  




 He only has the accommodation for Civics.  




 His IEP specifies certain accommodations. His reading comprehension is low and this helps him pass Civics.

 




 I'm a Title 1 Paraeducator 




 His IEP specifies certain accommodations. 




 He answered all 27 questions and only missed 4!  




 I didn't know how to change the text size :-/. 




 There are several different SPED departments and I work with students who are Emotionally Disturbed. These students range from having Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, a student's father was schizophrenic and the student is quite paranoid and often lashes out, others have Autism (yes, it's real autism, not what people 'think is autism'), and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. 

The kids need our help and would not make it through school without it. 

The students I work with are freshman and most are in intermediate classes. They need extra help when it comes to Geometry, Biology and Civics. Also, that's why I challenged my student. I knew he could do it and did not need to accept the teachers accommodation. 




 I wish I had more time to spend with them. I plan to start working towards a Masters in Art Therapy and Clinical Psychology next year. My career goal is to work with children and adolescents. 




 My bad. Using certain types of punctuation has never been a strong suit.  




 Ma'am and thank you! :-) 




 Check out options through a temp agency....

It was the only way I was able to find a job, even with work experience, and a bachelor's degree.

They provide jobs both part-time and full-time.  




 If it had a 'collar' it was most likely a dog from the neighborhood, and it's lost, not lose.  




 Ok? 




 Smuggling one into the US was easy.

Wrapped mine in perfume covered plastic wrap and put it inside an empty tampon container.

Then I learned that, that does not stop drug dogs from picking up the scent.

Now I have a floral scented Cuban cigar.  














 If you're the type that doesn't like seeing animals, fish, etc in tight cages or tanks...it would be best to avoid that restaurant. 

It's not in Kansas, but the Perot Museum (http://www.perotmuseum.org/) in Dallas, TX has the fossils of all of the dinosaurs on display at the restaurant. 




 Avoiding First Management would be a great thing to do, but it won't be easy seeing how they own most of Lawrence.

 














 No, but there was a shooting on Iowa...

 Knowing that if something were to go wrong, you're bound to be stuck on the streets or lose your house and end up on the streets.

 That, but with a giant cat maze winding throughout the house.  




 Has anyone else noticed that they're always Asian?

 Yeah, so, I did not take your advice....

 Or false memories that your brain created. Deciphering those from reality is one hell of a challenge.
