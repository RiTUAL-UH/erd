 Just finished it, and yea that was hilarious. Plus the cameos! If you're a fan of new girl, watch! 




 I saw a trailer for this a year ago plus. Completely forgot about it till now, thank you. 




 I don't know:( Ive read so many, enjoyed so many...

Maybe The Stand? It was 1200 pages long and it never felt like it. Even books half that size start getting annoying. So,yea, I guess The Stand by Stephen King. 
 




 about how I have spent my day. I started off with a lot of activity but now im tired.

School 10-12

Gym 12-1

I dont even like baseball 




 Quickest one to do it too 




 Thank you, already read The Goldfinch, but I didn't know Infinite Playlist was based on a book. Will read! Also, extremely loud sounds very familiar.  




 $90 million OW. $250 million domestic $780 million WW 




 It will definitely not surpass Furious 7.  




 I can see this. Maybe up to fifteen percent more. 




 I, dont , know how to , use commas. But I do know that I want to read a novel set it modern day NYC. I want subway rides, central park shenanigans, and some sort of protagonist. Thank you. 




 $195 million.

Avengers rec will stand for a while. 




 You can talk about smoking here 




 Where these orders based on luck, or did you work for them? 




 As a future AG, wow didn't know we could go to Germany. 




 Is PT3 good?  




 Well I'm glad the reccomendation got through.

Sometimes books are the best medium for story. Like, imagine that The Stranger was a movie. 

How would they show the things he thought?

They just wouldn't be able to.


I guess they could have him narrarate his feelings, but that's lazy. 

I guess, to understand the appeal of books, you have to read good books. Books that are special. And "The Stranger" is def special. 




 Did you end up reading the stranger? I remember being forced to read it in high school, and by the end, it didn't feel like I was forced. I loved it. Crazy that it was written so long ago 




 That guys never gonna be in a street fight 




 The Stranger by Albert Camus 




 The Stand. Post apocalypse the follows the chain of events extremely closely. 




 Not like they know her name anyways lol 




 Admitting to LSD I think is auto DQ 




 World War Z. Kinda. If you judge it as it if it wasn't based on a book then you'll enjoy it.  




 Amy Smart is so smart 




 That does make sense. The future hasn't happened so it is written yet. But what keeps fucking with me is that I already know where ill be in a month. In boot camp. So I've lived the last couple months knowing that I would be at a specific place.

Honestly, one of the reasons I signed up for the navy was for this very thing. I hated being in college. Not knowing what the future was gonna be like, but now I know that in two or three years ill be inside some navy ship doing my job. Before I signed up I had no idea. 




 I guess the future seems more appealing to me. The present is literally right now, and I'm on reddit, drinking beer and watching vobs burgers. This doesn't matter... Like, will I ever look back on this moment?  




 I need to get on that "less so". Its hard tho, right? 




 Wasting it. Idk, but I feel like everything I do is pointless because I'm leaving soon. So why do anything? Right now i met someone and it just feels pointless. Why get to know her? I'm gonna be leaving her soon, so what's the point?  




 Hmmm. Not sure if this is relevant to my post much, but I do write sometimes. Oddly enough, I write time capsule like summaries. Like, to myself. "on 4/2/15 I did this, and I was hoping too". I write these because I'm hoping ill find these amusing in ten years. 




 I cant help but constantly being in the future. Everything I do, is based on the future. Even this post. As I write it, I'm thinking of the replies and the red envelope.


When I talk to a girl, every little thing becomes a potential snowball. Hmm. She doesn't like action movies... So when we're married, how am I gonna watch new releases? 

I'm going to the navy soon, I knew about this eight months ago, and honestly, these months have passed by so quickly and I haven't accomplished anything else beyond waiting. All I do evry day is think about it. I lost eight months of my life. Just waiting.

I quit my job a year ago because I didn't want to be there my whole life.

I forget about the past because it happened already.


Anyone else like this?
Any tips? 




 If you qualify for crypto, go for crypto. Wish I could have had a cleaner record. 




 Not all Hispanics are mexicans 




 Preach. Demographics are changing, Hollywood will too. 




 There are a lot more nationalities out there that make up non whites  




 Transformers 5 to take place in Cuba. Classic cars transforming everywhere. 




 It might seem unimportant, but if a diverse cast can bring in $147 million opening week, start expecting more films with diverse cast. 




 The Southern Reach trilogy is exactly what you're looking for. First book is called "Annihilation" 




 Thank you, I think I like this answer the best. But thank you all for replying. 




 Don't know if this is going to be long, but here we go.

Basically from what I've retained from secondary education, science documentaries and basic critical thinking I've come to accept evolution like this:

An animal or plant, whichever, mates with a compatible mate. Their offspring takes a little bit of each of the animals. They grow up to eventually have their own offspring. Somehow there is a mistake in the passing down of genes, and the offspring of this animal has brown fur. Peers of this animals find this unattractive and the animal doesn mate.

Generations later this mutation comes up again and this animal mates. passes down his mutation. Then that offspring moves away to a further tree by another river. Generations pass, and another mutation happens, larger feet. It gives this animal superiority, so he takes over. Suddenly generations later this tribe that moved away to this other river has brown fur and big feet, not like their black fur small feet having neighbors. The neighbors meet up at the big feet havers decide to kill the others. Now all animals of this species start carrying the brown fur and big feet genes.

I can keep typing but i guess that this is good enough, so do I understand evolution? 




 idk why downvotes, it felt like less time to me as well 




 Of course avengers will, first one was closer to 2 bill than 1 




 Content: no

Comments? definitely. place is an orgy of scummy young villainy. 




 Why both NavyFed and USAA? Is their an advantage to having two bank accounts? 




 No ones telling you why not, its because they are looking for candidates with STEM degrees and above 3.0 gpas. Liberal arts degrees dont get much cred sadly 




 I say skip this. Read the first one and was severely dissapointed. 




 Theres this series on amazon kindle which is dirt cheap and action packed "Terms of Enlistment"  




 go to navy.com and look at all the enlisted jobs. If you see at least three that look interesting to you go and talk to a recruiter.  




 I spent a while on the Wind Up Bird Chronicle and during the first two thirds it was worth it, but when I reached the end I felt like I wasted my time. Dont think ill visit his work again. 




 That's a pretty large margin though 




 Sam Mendes is wonderful and so are his movies. Revolutionary Road might be the most depressing films ever. 




 Including marketing, not bad. The craze has been dead for a while, but its not like people forgot they used to play these games. 




 Only of they're funny 




 Scott Ackerman 




 Your bar for comedy is low, that's not really a joke, just a simple analogy. 




 Night Film by Marissha Pessl. If you like cinema at all you'll like it. Its pretty dark. 




 $1.05 billion my estimate 




 Hmm, didn't know that about the overseas economies. Still think it has a chance. 




 Fast and Furious 6 hit $788 million.

Paul Walker tragically passed away.

The trailer is fucking bonkers.

The previews are hype.

No way it doesn't hit a billion. 




 That is one of the best scenes ever 




 Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut  




 What with the dancing? It was pretty much the same. There was a difference in the gambling tho
