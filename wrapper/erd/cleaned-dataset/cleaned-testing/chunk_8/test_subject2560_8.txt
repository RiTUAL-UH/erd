 I'm not talking about aching muscles. After a long strenuous ride I often get a bit of a headache and feel a bit rough for the rest of the day. If it's been a bit cold it takes ages to warm back up no matter what I do. It's probably a preparation thing or maybe just an occupational hazard... Any tips? 

UPDATE: Thanks for the advice everyone - I'm pretty sure I drink and eat enough while riding but it sounds like I need to make more of an effort to think about what I eat and drink afterwards and force myself to rehydrate even if I don't feel thirsty. Really helpful thank you!  




 Aww busted... no you're right I strode in here with a generic tale of how men meet women every minute of every day but I didn't actually use the exact details of a particular story. DAMN LYING SJW!!! 




 Ooo Ooo I know this one. So once right, my friend was at a party and he met this woman and then he waited until he was introduced and then he asked her about herself and was genuinely interested in her responses. He talked to her like she was a human being not a conquest or a prize to be won and then at the end of the evening when it became obvious that there was chemistry between them he asked her for her number. He was totally willing to accept that if she said no that wasn't because she was a bad person, just that she wasn't interested in him, but she said yes and told him to get in touch.

Then he text her, remembering that she'd said she liked quirky cocktail bars and invited her to one. When they got there he talked to her like a human being some more.

It worked so well that eventually SHE made a move on HIM. And he was grown up enough to realise this wasn't in anyway emasculating.

I don't how he does it, man...
