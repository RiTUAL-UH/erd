 I'm very petite, and weigh next to nothing. I don't need to lose weight, and he doesn't have a condition. We've checked...So please don't be rude.  




 My boyfriend has claimed he has a low sex drive recently, which is so strange for me because this has never been the case. He's always constantly wanting sex, and now he doesn't. I have tried laying around naked, wearing nice lingerie and he just doesn't stop to look. I find myself drooling over him when he walks around naked, yet he never stops to tell me I look good, or anything. I'm not very confident about my body as it is, so I am trying and I just feel ignored. Him having a low sex drive just makes me feel disgusting and extremely insecure. So how do I make.myself feel more.sexy when he isn't interested? 

UPDATE: I am not overweight or underweight, he claims he is still attracted to me, and I'm not going to get rid of my long term.boyfriend over something that could be fixed...thanks.. 




 Thanks all :)  




 Thanks!:) 




 Hi!

I'm a very anxious, and paranoid female and have been diagnosed with depression. I am taking anti depressants but I still find it hard to be wind down and relax.

Please let me know of any good methods and ideas you use/have. 

Thanks :)  




 I've had a very low time, and I'm becoming fearful about how much longer I can live like this. Nobody around me cares about me, aside from my boyfriend but there is only so much he can do. We can't even be together during the week, and its the Times I need him. I'm not dealing so well at work, and my family do not give a shit about me. I really am struggling, and nobody seems to want to help me. 

I don't know what to do anymore.  




 If he's a sex god, then yes. 100%.
