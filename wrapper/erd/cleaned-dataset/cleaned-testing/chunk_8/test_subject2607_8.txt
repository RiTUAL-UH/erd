 Nah, you're close though

They usually look more green but 




 Going into my third year of Spanish. I love it, I'm planning on minoring in it in college. 




 I disagree with it. I'll sometimes make jokes about freshmen, but they're not serious. Honestly I try to help them out as much as I can, and be friends with them as much as I can, and make them feel accepted. It's hard being a freshman and I try to put myself in their shoes again. The most annoying thing is new sophomores making fun of freshmen. 




 About 1600 people, 9th to 12th grade. It's mostly either people who think they're redneck and southern or people who think they're ghetto, even though we live in the suburbs in Michigan. We just spent $2 million  that we don't have on a new football stadium for a team that won two games in three years. Our tests scores are in the 40th percentile in the state. Pretty below average.

Golden retrievers and babies are the purest forms of good in the world. Also I like reading and knitting and music and robots. 

Plz. 




 Yes! Oh my gosh I'm dumb, you're psychic. Thank you! 




 This might be a stretch, but there's this classic rock song that I know the rhythm of the chorus to, but I can't remember the lyrics or the name. It's really heavy rock and the chorus sounds really loud. It's one of those songs that everyone knows and has heard, like when I heard it at a dance the other day everyone was singing along. I had thought the lyrics were "You.. give me aaaaall I need" but it doesn't look like those are it. Sorry this is so vague, but it's been bothering me to no end. Thanks if anyone has any ideas. 




 Summer - Calvin Harris
Shamelessly addicted. 




 Rounding to the hundredths place instead of the tenths place. Failed a test that I should have gotten 100 percent on. 




 I have a fear of bridges, and pretty much my advice is to just do it. Don't even think about it beforehand because you'll just psych yourself out. 




 Annamarie225/16/F/USA

I posted here yesterday but I only got like one person so ugh I need to procrastinate please message me ily 




 I'm not sure. I consider myself atheist but I read a lot about Buddhism and Buddhist teachings because I like the philosophy aspect of it. 




 Yeah that sounds like a bad time. Just find a public or not crazy private college that you're interested in. Do some research. 




 annamarie225/F/16/US

I'll talk about anything and I need to procrastinate on my book report halp 




 Annamarie225 16/F I'm willing to talk about whatever and I do marching band and frc and I probably like you a lot. 




 I've had that song on my phone for years and I still think it's incomprehensible gibberish. 




 PARAMORE AND FALL OUT BOY VIP TICKETS TUESDAY NIGHT 




 A dumb boy. 




 Samson - Regina Spektor (it reminds me of someone)
In My Life by The Beatles and Drops of Jupiter by Train both remind me of my dad.
Sigh. 




 Mr. Widemouth and (don't yell at me) Candle Cove are my favorites 




 That sounds terrifying either way though! I'm so beyond lucky that's never happened to me, lol 




 Hey my birthday is tomorrow! Happy birthday! Let's celebrate having almost the same birthday together! 




 Sleep paralysis. It can cause some awful hallucinations. My friend gets it where aliens and other weird things pull up chairs next to her bed and stars at her.  




 Thank you. It helped writing it out. Have a nice day! 




 Read but not responded, and he's posted on reddit in that time frame. It's been about 5 days.  




 annamarie225  15/F

I'm from Michigan and I do marching band and frc and I'm tired and my birthday is in 2 days 




 Nope. We were perfectly fine, and we both went to bed because it was late, then the next morning he wouldn't talk to me. 




 Last night. I had a friend who I was talking to and cared about and shared a lot of really personal things with and now he's completely ignoring me and I don't know why. And I trusted him with all these things too. 




 Kik 




 My school has one except instead of being mean you  send in compliments about people and it anonymously posts them it's sweet actually  




 Vans and Converse  




 Boom Clap - Charli XCX. Oh my god it's so catchy. 




 THAT USED TO BE MY SONG IN LIKE 2009 THANK YOU SO MUCH I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT 




 One thing I notice is that a lot of places and people on the internet really glorify mental illness and depression and self harm. Tumblr especially doesn't shut up about how your scars are beautiful and that mental illness is just this thing for misunderstood moody teenagers. Obviously we shouldn't be criticizing people who have mental illness or have self harmed, but we make it seem like this thing that makes you unique or different or misunderstood when in reality it's awful and doesn't make you feel special. I think that might contribute to it in teenagers especially. It's glorified. 




 I don't. I don't think most girls do. 




 3,654  




 Cheez-its

Ew 




 Colours - Grouplove 




 Come On Eileen, Mr. Blue Sky, and Here Comes The Sun are my happy songs. 




 Michigan

We have drugs and poverty and water and tears. 




 My eyes are kind of pretty and my teeth are kind of straight I guess. 




 Thank you 3

I would do a link but I'm on mobile so 




 annamarie225 15/f

It's 2 am and I don't have anyone to talk to. I do marching band and frc and I like books and sleeping and animals. So. Please. 




 That's really cute actually aw 




 Taller than me (not that it's difficult since I'm 5'3"), funny, preferably dark hair and dark eyes but I'm not picky, smart, puts up with being forced to listen to my music, geeky, and maybe kinda chubby. I'm not picky though tbh I take what I can get 




 Hey, one B won't ruin your GPA. That sucks that the stuff on the test wasn't covered in class, that's infuriating. Good luck with all your other finals though. 




 Northern Michigan or nothern California or Seattle. I'd love to move to a South American country but I don't like the heat, so.  




 I think I'm the really shy girl with the weird glasses and 8 different hand sanitizers on her purse .__. 




 Our team is green and black, but we don't refer to it as green, I've only heard my team refer to it as "robot green" for some reason. The whole team is really obsessed with that shade of green for some reason, the lights on our robot were that same bright green and it got us the imagery award at Waterford this year. And we adopted the team name and logo from our school, since we wanted to be integrated within the school. So the captain head is the main logo on our shirts and we incorporated it into our rebound rumble robot, also getting us the imagery award.  




 Here is 3098's wrap-up video from worlds. The very beginning and very end make me kinda sad and nostalgic tbh 

http://youtu.be/lQ1IGKVyI30 




 ARE YOU FUCKING JOKING 




 YES. UGH. Life ruining. 




 We had a German exchange student at my school who was REALLY sweet and well-liked and she was pretty much great tbh 




 I've been listening to Straight Up by Paula Abdul for a half an hour and you can't stop me. 




 Oh my god. I don't even know. It's a long story and he's really difficult to read but idk. He's frustrating and I have no clue where I am with him. 




 IT PISSED ME OFF SO BAD THAT THE STUPID BOARD GAME SHIT WAS NEVER UPDATED. 




 My friend wrote a really in-depth and long thing in my yearbook. It was super sweet, and at the end it was "If I were a guy, I'd date you" with a bunch of wink faces and idk that made me laugh. The whole thing just made me stupidly happy tbh 




 I once failed a geometry test because I rounded to the hundredths decimal place instead of tenths. 




 annamarie225. 15/f. I like robots and music and marching band and cats and I'm a huge weenie

Plz 




 That's super cute, made my night a little happier! Congrats!! 




 I agree. That makes sense, and it's the first legitimately respectful comment I've gotten. Honestly, if I had realized that then I wouldn't have made the original comment. I didn't even think about that before. 




 Whoops, sorry I forgot that thinking that displaying racial slurs in a public place makes me "way too sensitive." My bad.
