 Didn't Karl Pilkington find one of those in the wild during his climb of Mt Fuji?  




 So that one was actually malicious, but this one is just simple dipshitery.  




 [Lol, like this?] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034314/)  




 I don't think that incompetence suggests malice.  




 Some fully formed organs. Not all of them are fully formed. Especially not the brain which is what we consider to be the most human of them all.  




 This comes across as incompetence to me.  




 So in other words the governor doesn't understand how the process works and no one in his office explained it to him.  




 Okay. So you're not a creationist. No one really cares about this sort of stuff. That's your personal belief and it doesn't affect anything or anyone else. When you start trying to substitute actual* science with those beliefs is when we have a problem.  




 How is standing for rule of law "anti-cop"?  




 You might remember Baptist as the denomination of Christianity that prides itself in not aggressively proselytizing at every possible opportunity.

What?  




 You're allowed to believe whatever you want. Just understand that it's in no way science and has no place in a discussion about science.  




 Are you trying to say that /r/coontown and other subs like it need exposure in order to exist because that's not really true. Most of these controversial subs get most of their traffic through word of mouth. If users don't log in they can't vote, post, or comment so who cares about them. People who opt out of seeing this side of reddit will miss out on a lot more than just a few hateful subs. Most people will want to see at least some of that content so this isn't going to exclude enough people to directly kill any of those communities. 

This wouldn't necessarily hurt any subs, but it will allow reddit to isolate that content and sell ad space for better or worse.  




 Because their unions lobby against decriminalization and legalization, and to increase criminal penalties so that their industry will continue to grow.  




 Yep. I agree wholeheartedly.  




 He was born again and very religious before he died. Christ forgives all sins. That would have to include drilling a hole in a teenage boys head and filling it with acid in an attempt to create a mindless sex slave. Go figure.  














 *Incarcerated

So basically the NYPD is just arresting people for no good reason. This is sickening. Almost every employee in a job that requires manual labor benefits from having a simple lock blade on their belt.  




 Of course he felt threatened. There was a defiant suspect in his presence. It didn't matter that she was a tiny teenage girl in handcuffs. He was fearful for his safety. She could have said something to really hurt his feelings. Teenage girls can be really mean. Especially when they've been drinking.  





























 Oh, my bad. I didn't realize that it was wrong to expect people to behave with any sort of integrity or honesty.  




 Ahh. Well, it was still appropriate so, no harm no foul.  




 And your male teenagers.  




 Anti fracking? How is that antiscience? You'd have to be an idiot to support a company whose operations are causing cluster cancer, earthquakes, contaminated drinking water, and flooding your streets with toxic waste. Opposing this shit is antiscience? That's rich. So now anything that opposes the operations and therefore profits of major corporations is antiscience? That's a very special perspective you have.  




 The creationist argument is the definition of idiotic and ignorant denial of science.  




 What are you trying to say? That Republicans are more likely to accept the scientific concensus that Democratic voters? If you're talking about the antivaccination movement you should do a bit of research. Those assholes are split very evenly across political ideologies with a slight increase as a person becomes more conservative.  




 What do you want me to do, go through every state's legal definition until I find one that doesn't define corrections officers as law enforcement so you can be right? Literally every source and authority I've looked at defines corrections officers as law enforcement. You're in the minority. No one else is arguing your case. Just give it up already.  




 I think a better argument would be that profit is not automatically and always a good thing.  




 The thing is iirc, he invited a bunch of these people to the award ceremony.  




 Apparently, on top of being in exact opposition of everyone else on this topic, you have a reading comprehension problem.  




 You're right. But I'm surrounded by Christians and they believe that Jeffrey Dahmer is in heaven right now.  




 This is probably why they don't travel abroad.  




 What? This isn't an argument. I'm not supporting the war on drugs. I'm explaining why your post was removed.  




 That's funny. I usually look at Dahmer as an argument against religion. According to the tenets of Christianity Dahmer should be in heaven with god and Jesus right now doing whatever he wants for all of eternity. But everyone outside of Christianity will burn in eternal hell fire. That's a lot of good, decent people suffering forever.  




 From the wiki:

During this period, Robinson cultivated and maintained the outward appearance of a community-minded citizen and family man; he became a Scoutmaster, a baseball coach and a Sunday school teacher. In 1977 he talked his way onto the board of directors of a localcharitable organizationand forged a series of letters from its executive director to the mayor of Kansas City, and from the mayor to other civic leaders, commending his generous volunteer efforts and generally singing his praises. Eventually he had himself named the organization's Man of the Year, and threw a festive awards luncheon in his own honor.

He was an* accomplished fraud.  




 There's also the fact that one study doesn't "prove" anything. It's completely possible that another study could have entirely different results.  




 I disagree. I think it's obvious that religious freedom for Christians means that only Christians should be free to practice their religion.  




 Pretty obvious sock puppet.

 "I hate them for who they love so they should be marginalized and discriminated against."  




 That's garbage. Posting an article in this sub does not equal a complete endorsement or agreement of its contents. 

I never said they should be disbarred. You can create whatever narrative you like, but it won't change anything.  




 Well, they're certainly not supporting religious freedom. They're pushing their own special brand of McMorality.  




 The courts have ruled that civil servants do not have the same rights as normal citizens during the performance of their duties and sometimes even during their personal time. Whether you agree with this or not is irrelevant. 

I didn't say that they should be disbarred. I suggested that there were possibly ethics violations that should be investigated. But, on reddit you're not allowed to be wrong without hordes upon hordes descending upon you to call you names and tell you that you're wrong.  




 I'm warning you, this thread is not going to be friendly to your opinion.  




 This is terrible. What kind of scumbag would listen to scientologists regarding mental heath issues.  




 No they're not. They're just assholes.  




 Yeah. That's right. Are you okay?  




 Please don't tell me what to do.  




 And how were the movements OWS/Ferguson/Baltimore illegal. And don't tell me that the movements were illegal because of a few bad actors because that's bullshit.  




 Oh they can. They'll just be fired. Civil disobedience is not a protected right. I don't know why you would think that it was.  




 Well you joke, but this amounts to more than just inconvenience. We used to have multiple arts and crafts stores here. They were family owned businesses. I was actually close with the family that owned the Ben Franklin. Things did not work out well for them.  




 Yeah. I remember those days just a couple of years ago. People were so free. Insurers were* free to deny children coverage because of existing conditions. Insurers were free to wait for a premium holder to file a large claim and then dropped them for something as simple as failing to report every childhood cavity or acne. You're right. Freedom is great isn't it? /s 




 Whether or not it's legal, it's certainly a dick move and it basically means that I and other artists and crafters in my area must drive two hours away or order everything online.  




 That's what I thought too, but the attorney in this thread said that oath is unenforceable.  




 With the new executive order that's not necessary anymore.  




 Thank you /u/in_yo_mouth for having the strength and courage to make everyone's contraceptive decisions for them. Next will you decide which shitty school we're allowed to send our kids to once a condom breaks?  




 Not to mention that they basically put all other arts and crafts stores out of business while simultaneously carrying a majority of hokey Christian related products and refusing to carry anything that might be from other religions or philosophies. Talk about freedom! 




 This is just poetically hypocritical.  




 Absolutely. But the executive order should sufficiently remove the employer from the equation.  




 I think you answered your own question.  




 You're right. The Supreme Court allowed employers to opt out, the executive signed an order allowing third party insurance to pay for it. Now employees can get the medicine they need and employers can butt-out. 

Edit: added a comma.  




 Did you even read the fucking article?  




 It's been explained to me that there's no precedent for disbarring either of these politicians. But if they were investigated it would be for violating the ethical guidelines defined by their respective licensing bodies, not for their political offices.  




 Apparently. Please go away.  




 My point is that the oath is unenforceable. But I don't care either way. I'm not arguing for impeachment. Why don't you bring your argument to /u/firstamendanon? He/she is a lawyer and can answer your questions. 

In the meanwhile, please refrain from insulting me personally.  




 An attorney takes the same oath that a politician takes in regards to upholding the law and the constitution. The lawyer in this thread said it's unenforceable.  




 Am I a criminal if I leave my car parked by the meter for too long?  




 Disobeying federal cannabis laws.  




 Right. But they do it all of the damn time. It recently came out that Rick Perry is on the payroll of the biggest donor to his superpac. Unless they were literally standing in front of a camera, how do you prove coordination or collusion? It's unenforceable garbage.  




 What the hell are you talking about?  




 Elected officials have a right to free expression. By your logic, nearly every elected official in Colorado should be impeached.  




 Luckily he'll never get the chance to do anything to the country.  




 You're right. I've become far more liberal in the last 15 years.  




 Correct.  




 You can at least stabilize the head, apply a compress, and proceed to rush the victim to an emergency department. But I guess if you are a police officer who shot someone, you want to be certain that they will die, so you do nothing.  




 I agree. This could very well solve a lot of the problems we're having with the police in this country.  




 A cop confiscating your camera and arresting you is not a passive act.  




 The sheriff said he was not happy to have to continue paying Bagnall a salary that he estimated to be in the high 40s until the case was resolved.

Theres a victim in this case ... and sometimes the system stinks, Bartlett said.

Were very proud of the job we do here, and this is not something we take lightly, The sheriff added. I was extremely disappointed in his actions, and he will never again set foot in this building, unless he goes to jail.

Good on the sheriff for turning this dirt bag out on his ass. Hopefully he'll do some real time for this. 

 




 Well, it would need to be more organized than that. Someone would have to write some legislation so it can be presented at the state or federal level.  




 You don't arrest criminals. The police are far too cowardly for that. You pick on kids and vulnerable people for smoking pot or being black. You take kick backs from or just steer clear of actual criminals.  




 I wonder where those god awful pigs from PnS are on this one? I wonder why they're not here to explain "how we don't know the whole story yet" or some shit like that.  




 Is that what you call it when the professional board that issued your license questions your ethics?  




 Omg, they actually cited that user even though he admitted that he was lying when he said he took that photo. What a bunch of assholes.  




 Holy shit. So aside from beating and killing innocent people the police are also ignoring and humiliating the victims of violent crimes? We don't need them.  









 You may be right about segregation being the basis of most Jim Crow laws, but understand that you're arguing that Ted Cruz is not unlike those tortured souls who fought for equal rights and treatment while he, in fact, argues against the equal rights and treatment of another group. And it's still true that there was much about the Jim Crow south that can not be explained by "separate but equal".

 My favorite part is how Forbes says he's worth more like $4.1 billion. 




 Can you read? 

Edit: I posted an article. That doesn't mean that it represents my views entirely and I didn't write the damn thing. Yesterday I posted an article that explained Santorum's position on a constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage. I sure as hell don't agree with that man about anything.  




 First commenter, whoever you are you may be shadowbanned. You can find out at /r/shadowban.  
























 Not all of them. That only applies to segregation. Jim Crow was much worse than just segregation.  




 The livelihood? He's a publicly paid elected official. It's also worth pointing out that he's made it his personal political mission to go after families he doesn't identify or agree with. 

Edit: It's also worth noting that he supports employers having the right to deny someone a job or terminate them on the basis of their sexual orientation, and businesses having the right to deny service or products to someone on the same basis.  




 So you're saying that Bernie Sanders should be in prison for allowing cannabis to be decriminalized in his jurisdiction?  




 The public employees who refuse to obey the law and perform their duties should be terminated by their immediate supervisors or the next elected official up.  




 I wasn't advancing the argument that they should be disbarred. I asked a simple question.  




 You're probably right, but at the very least it makes them hypocrites.  




 But this article and this discussion are referring to these politicians professional legal licenses. Otherwise what would we be talking about?  




 When did Senator Sanders obtain a professional license that could be scrutinized or revoked?  




 What do you call officers of the court and elected officials instructing public employees to disobey the law and refuse to perform their duties?  




 We already pay for the utility. Just like every other public and private service. There's no reason why we should have to pay for their mistakes as well as suffer the consequences of them. 

Then the individual himself is held responsible.  




 It's not the victim's family making these claims. It's the owner of the mobile home park and therefore the surveillance cameras that caught the footage.  




 Yes he was. He was not a public employee, and he was not an American so anything he said or did is not applicable here, and I think it's more than ridiculous to compare Senator Cruz to Ghandi.  




 How is advising public employees to disobey the law and refuse to do their jobs civil disobedience? Public employees are not private citizens during the performance* of their duties. This sounds more like "professional disobedience" or in other words, "insubordination" and grounds for termination.  




 Yeah, third party is what I'm talking about. I don't know about you, but most of the people I've spoken to would prefer if taxpayers were liable in any way for the actions of these employees. It's bad enough that we have to pay for their salaries and their equipment. It's unconscionable we should have to pay when they brutalize or kill us too.  




 Don't know. I doubt it, but it would surprise me if no attorney has ever faced sanctions for endorsing lawlessness.  









 No, public employees refusing to obey the law and do their jobs is not civil disobedience. A licensed attorney and public official advising public employees to disobey the law is not civil disobedience. And even if it is, civil disobedience has never been protected by law. If you need examples of this look at all of the people brutalized during Occupy Wallstreet, the Ferguson and Baltimore protests, or any other protest in US history.  




 It would have to be paid for by the individual. Cops would have to cooperate just as nurses, doctors, contractors, truck drivers, etc.  




 So then it's just meaningless. Because murder for hire is extremely rare and overall murder rates are unaffected by capital punishment.  




 So you don't have a source. 

Because what I'm saying is that Jim Crow laws were unconstitutional and once challenged they were thrown out by the applicable courts including SCOTUS. An attorney should not be telling anyone to break the law, but they can render an opinion on whether a statute is lawful and constitutional. In this case the SCOTUS has already determined the constitutionality of same sex marriage. Senator Cruz knows the law. He's not rendering an opinion, he's advising public employees to disobey the law which is very clear.  




 He wasn't so that didn't happen. 

But, I suppose if he possessed a license to practice law and violated the bar's ethics guidelines it would need to be investigated and he would possibly face sanctions. 

Edit: grammar  




 I understand that the author of the article said disbarred, but I said investigated. 

Where those Jim Crowe laws upheld by the SCOTUS? Do you have a source that suggests they were? 

Because, from what I understand your hypothetical is the exact opposite of history. Politicians and lawyers were mostly supportive of the oppressive policies, or in other words, the exact same position as Cruz and friends. It took the Supreme Court to overturn those unconstitutional laws and the established powers were resistant to those changes.  









 A licensed attorney is supposed to maintain a certain amount of professionalism and respect for the law. Actively advising public employees to disobey the law is questionable at best, and at the least worthy of professional scrutiny.  




 Admitting you're wrong is the first step to addressing any mistake.  




 See the other conversation that started at this comment.  




 I'm talking about them breaking the ethics rules regarding their licenses. We're not just talking about disagreeing with a political policy. These men have advised the public to break the law. There's nothing immoral about LGBT marriage, but it's certainly immoral to discriminate against* and marginalize those you dislike or disagree with.  




 Yep. Nurses have the same requirements, and they don't even carry guns.  




 Good argument for them to relinquish their licenses. Thanks.  




 That'd be great. I've been pushing this idea for a while now. The only person to argue with me was a cop, but it's obvious why he'd rather the state carry the liability for his fuck ups.  




 No, they should be investigated for advising people to break the law while possessing a very specific professional license. What's the point in this type of license if it doesn't regulate certain types of behavior?  




 I would argue that some people would prefer to not be relegated to the status of second class citizen. You know that whole "separate but equal" thing?  




 Even better solution; require all officers to carry a professional license and professional liability insurance. If an individual cop fucks up he will find himself uninsurable, without a license, and therefore out of a job.  




 Or at the very least have their licenses investigated and possibly be disbarred.  




 Maybe we taxpayers should do something to ensure that the police will stop killing us.  




 And if it's never released to the public would you just believe the police narrative?  




 I'd like those assholes from PnS to explain this one.  




 A licensed attorney should not be advising people to break the law. Most likely nothing will come of it, but it is worth pointing out.  




 Believe it or not, [he actually is being charged with conspiracy and obstruction among other things.] (http://6abc.com/news/philadelphia-police-officer-charged-after-being-shot/851157/)  




 Flash grenade to the face.  




 He was killed for contempt of cop.  














 What happened to the natives is/was terrible. But I hardly think it's appropriate to compare them to a conversation about wildlife management. Killing and destroying a population of people is hardly the same thing as mismanaging a species of herd animals.
