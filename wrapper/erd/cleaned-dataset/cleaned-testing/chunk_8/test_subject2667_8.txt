 Gaaah I knew I should have cut McCarthy on my fantasy team this week. 

Also, I think we can call this year the curse of the MacMath. A young, but constantly improving goalkeeper suddenly had the rug pulled from under him and the Union have had keeper (and winning) problems ever since.  




 Jihad is not part of the five pillars of Islam. Fasting, prayer, Hajj, the declaration of faith, and charity are the five. I don't know where you got Jihad from. 




 I confused Black September with the PFLP, a Marxist Palestinian group. My apologies. However, Black September was still secular and not particularly motivated by religion. 









  I have been. They lied to me then, just as you are now.

You're only lying to yourself. You have a confirmation bias. You will only believe negative items about Islam. I wish you peace, and I sincerely hope you find it.  









   I feel the most useful public discourse would challenge Geller to organize an event that lampooned both Jesus and Muhammed.

Muslims are also forbidden from depicting Jesus, or any other prophet of God. So Muslims would likely shy way from any kind of event, as was the case here, as the only two protesters at the event were these two people.  




 Your source is non-academic and biased. Taiqiyya is only to be used when one's life is in danger, and has historically been associated with Shi'a Muslims, who concealed their faith to avoid physical harm. I'm not lying to you, and it would be a sin for me to do so. Google that Quranic verse on non-compulsion in religion (which you ignored) if you don't believe me. 

 So you're in a minority. Or, you're lying. Either way, what do I care?

Ah, there we are. Your mind is closed. No matter what you learn or who you meet, you would stubbornly remain prejudiced against Islam and Muslims.  

Muslims like myself are the majority of the world's Muslims. As loud as the extremists may be, their attacks are isolated and don't spark that massive war between Muslims and "The West" (this doesn't make sense because many Muslims live in the West and consider themselves Western). I've attended many mosques and gatherings of different interpretations of Islam, from Sufi to Shia to even Salafi, and have never heard of imposition. 

 Facts define Muslims. A poll determines facts. If you believe those facts are in error, it is incumbent on you to demonstrate it, not just throw your hands in the air and claim you don't believe polls. You'd do just as well saying you don't believe in math.

Well, I'd suggest you show up to a mosque and sincerely and politely ask questions. It doesn't seem like you've ever met any Muslims. I'd sit down and talk with you, but as I mentioned before, you seem a bit closed minded, plus you'd probably physically attack me or something. 

I hope you find the truth, or at least, lose your hostility. Peace be unto you. 
 




 No, I've heard it used by Muslims talking about extremists espousing Salafi ideals, especially those prejudiced against minority religious sects.  




  Yes, you implicitly did, just as the author of the article did, by implying that Geller's personality in any way whatsoever justified the response of attempted murder 

We clearly didn't read the same article, as Ali condemned the attackers, saying that Islam says to ignore them. There were no protesters at the exhibition, except the two attackers. The large Dallas-area Muslim community mostly stayed away. The writer in no way says that Geller's personality incited or justified the murder. 

By accusing me of implicitly supporting their actions, you're attempting to read my mind. Neither was justified in their actions, in my opinion. Geller's same "free speech" stance is undermined by the fact that she campaigned against Al Jazeera's launching a network in the United States.  




 I think you'd be surprised if you looked at Muslims and gun ownership in Texas. Most, especially those of an immigrant background, do not own guns. 

**EDIT**: Thank you to /u/espitatic for changing "Muslims" to "ISIS" in the above comment.  




 A poll is supposed to define Muslims? I am a Muslim and in none of the mosques I've attended have I ever heard of anyone preaching that Islam should be imposed on anyone. Extremism exists, but it is called extremism because *it is beyond the pale and outside of the mainstream.* It not only flies in the face of religion practiced by the vast majority of its one-billion plus adherents, but also in Islamic history.  

People like to take verses of the Quran out of context. Well, see what you can do with this one: 

"Let there be no compulsion in religion." - Quran 2:256.  




 We're talking about the writer of this article, not the attackers.  




 Where did you get the idea that the reasonableness of depicting the Prophet was an argument? Or that anyone was justifying lethal force aside from ISIS and fellow extremists? Where has that argument been raised in this piece?  









 Haha, I think Wade Barrett told Jericho that when Jericho was his "pro" during the first season of NXT.  




 Can you seriously not distinguish between ISIS and the other billion-plus Muslims around the world?  




  Wasn't the Munich massacre 42 years ago?

That was a Marxist group who was responsible.  




  In fact, they probably "support" the muslim extremists, inasmuch as they probably think we should give up our free speech so as not to antagonize them.

You're pulling that out of thin air. "OMG he's criticizing the cartoons he must want to appease ISIS" is some zero-sum nonsense.  




  Finally, I'm not really interested in hearing veiled justifications for the attacks based on the personality of one of the people involved in the exhibit. Apologising for people who attempted murder because they were offended by some cartoons is frankly disgusting.


Where on earth are you getting that idea? Nobody is apologizing for any attack. Based on your comments and seeming support for Geller, I could make a similar argument that your condemnation for Anders Brevlik's massacre is nowhere to be found either.  




 **Submission Statement**

The shootings in Garland, Texas over an exhibition of cartoons depicting Prophet Muhammad helped extremists as well as bigots with their narrative: that "Islam is at war with the West."

To quote the writer: "These ideological extremists are two faces of the same coin; they have a symbiotic relationship strengthened and sustained by the others toxic absolutism." 





























 Add Otunga to that. 




 I read that in David Spade's voice. 




 All of them dated Susie, too.  




 Nah, you just have to get a special glove like Donkey Kong. 




 THEN Luke Harper.  




 Bork Bobland.  




 Probably because Pete (we think) tipped him off.  




 I think you mean /u/AKATheMaskedMan. 
 




 The Masked Man (David Shoemaker, /u/AKATheMaskedMan), before going to Grantland, had his column at Deadspin, a Gawker property. To say they are no friends of the industry is a massive generalization.  














 You don't want to have a nationality NOT named after a family?  




 Yet again, Vince doesn't think foreigners can be the top faces.  




 Eva Marie! 




 I should have addressed this in my comment. The kafala system is crap and is a form of slavery. Workers from South Asia are horribly exploited.  




 Yes, everyone should. Read it here: http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/343b1k/this_man_really_hit_the_nail_on_the_head_when_it/cqqxlit?context=3 




 The rise of Hindu nationalism, specifically that of the BJP in India, is bringing with it advocacy of Israel and prejudice/discrimination against Muslims, which brings with it Arab bashing. 

 




 **Submission Statement**

A journalist covering the riots in Baltimore saw two different sides of the city in a matter of seconds, but also put some context to what she saw, and what was neglected in the city.  









 I was laughing out loud. Pete getting out old-moneyed! 




 Oh, like those Californians Don met in the first season.  




 In New York, there are so many they are bound to be. The street shawarma in NYC is world-famous. Steinway Street in Queens and Atlantic Avenue are full of them. In the D.C., I know of a few Arab restaurants in Georgetown and Northern Virginia that are supposed to be good. 




 Have you ever been to New York and parts of D.C.? Plenty of Arab restaurants there.  




  Arabs are late immigrants to the United States,

Except in Michigan.  




 You should be able to get it in Chicago; there's a sizeable Arab community there from what I've heard.  









 On the contrary, at least it shows original reporting by each outlet. Granted, they all could be wrong, but at least the PR firms aren't winning the information war, right?  




 But does Bielefeld actually exist? That's what concerns me.  














 That's an interesting point.  




 That requires a new pro contract, which might not work with salary caps, etc.  




 Also Soony Saad and Justin Meram.  




 Soony Saad and Justin Meram are from Michigan. Both are pros, both are Arab-American and both play for Lebanon and Iraq respectively.  




 They support most of Hezbollah's stances but aren't the party's base.  




 I saw this on WrestleCrap years ago. Still wondering what Tiny Tim was doing on a wrestling show.  




 I've read elsewhere that those areas are primarily Shia and are pretty much AMAL's constituency since Hezbollah won't back weed farming. AMAL is allied with Hezbollah though.  




  Hezbollah protects the great kush fields of Lebanon

Isn't that AMAL territory?  




 Your opinion is disgraceful to that flag you have as your flair.  




 Can someone please leak one of the drafts of the TPP?  









 Nobody is attacking you or anyone for being successful. The attack is on hindering the success of others long ago and leaving the remnants of that mentality around today to continue that hindrance. It is not about guilt. It is about respect.  




 Google professional wrestler Jimmy Wang Yang.  









 Found Zapp Brannigan.  




 And that's why you always read the article! *waves hook* 














 Teshonisn't dragging himself through the media. This article only has comments from Teal Bunbury. 




 When are they going to expand this tournament and include every level of Canadian soccer in it? 




 That isn't what I said, but that is some severe butthurt.  




 Assad's regime still treats religious minorities better. 














 Kevin Eck was a journalist with the Baltimore Sun and left them for a creative job with WWE. His name was even on WWE.com a lot. You can Google it, it's true. 









 LOBIENA or SLOBINA 




 Oh good, nobody got Matt Damon.  




 Dolo used to do this with the national team on occasion.  




 He was on Jericho's podcast, actually. 









 Rock's St. Louis comments remind me of this: http://deadspin.com/cardinals-fans-get-ugly-in-clash-with-ferguson-proteste-1643282285 




 What did Adam Jones do?  




  Rock's entire rant is simply the populist pules of a racist.

It's the monologue of a comedian. You seem to have missed the humor in it. Rock is no more a racist than you are, unless you see criticism of anything white as racist.  




 Looking through the comments here, no one seems to be addressing Rock's point about the lily-white crowds.  




 It is a big deal, it's a historically black college. 

EDIT: I was wrong, it is Stillman. 




 He's a stand-up comedian, think of it as a riff or ribbing.  




 Because everybody watches football just to see the halftime show.  




  when they reject it you can't blame MLB

I'm pretty sure you can if they aren't succeeding. Maybe they are just bad programs that need fixing.  




 Bob Dylan was very pro-civil rights, incidentally. See his song "Hurricane." 




 I loved that hop he used to do out of the batter's box after hitting a home run, and that peace sign/kiss thing in the dugout. Of course, I hate him for his contribution to that horrible Orioles collapse in 2005. 
 




 By that metaphor, Estadio Azteca would be destroyed at the end.  









 Seattle fans don't dominate this subreddit. I've been here for a few years and can confidently say so. Also, many of those that are here have been around since the team was founded.  














 **Submission Statement:**

Der Spiegel, in a long story published over the weekend, "Secret files reveal the structure of Islamic State, said it gained access to 31 pages of handwritten charts, lists and schedules that amount to a blueprint for the establishment of a caliphate in Syria, which the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has declared it has set up.

 Good looking and tough, and not signed to a WWE contract? Somehow, I'm not surprised.  




 Well, he's not a fan, especially of wrestling in particular.  




 At least Houston's got the right idea in trying to tap the talent in south Texas. They're even putting their USL affiliate there.  




 Riley! 




 I can't tell if this is satire or not.

You're right in everything but this phrase...

 Reading the article, it sounds like his father has bad blood with the sultan and thus, he may be up for grabs.  




 I'd put Yarbrough ahead of Johnson, on par with Hamid. He starts for a pretty good Club Leon team.  




   Another group with a good number of supporters is Hearts of Oak.

Which resembles an upscale country club in terms of its membership policies.  




 At one point, you could only have one black player per team.  




 How'd that work out?  




 Rimando is Mexican-American.  




 No, you mostly get pity.  









 As I also said above, he's also from Mercer Island, a very wealthy community, and I can't imagine his parents put much stock in a professional athlete's career. Thus, there probably is a lot of pressure on him to get his college degree before signing any contract, foreign or domestic.

  I like Lenhart.

Uh oh, now you've done it! 




 I'd put them on par with Roma.  




 Are you sure it wasn't Fake Tottenham you bought?  




 Plus they use Under Armour kits.  









 Is it fair to say he has *puts on sunglasses* Inkoom problems?

 Drake helped TFC quite a bit.  




 People travel for international games. There are a lot of Mexicans in the surrounding areas, and trust me when I say they would fill a substantial part of RFK, FedEx or even M T Bank Stadium if Mexico was playing.

There's your difference. A government subsidy is not being requested, but tax relief is.  




 Are you mad, brother?  




 It doesn't help that the only player from Liga MX in the World Cup was DaMarcus Beasley.  




 LOL, I just came up with it. I am South Asian myself. One day we get a national team Desi. Considering how most of us aren't that tall and cricket isn't really taking off in America, we should be playing more soccer.  









 Samosa Indian or frybread Indian?  




 Kljestan's father is Serbian, and I believe Guzan is of Serban descent. Besler sounds German but I'm not sure. 

Howard's mother is Hungarian-Jewish.  




 Some forms even classify Middle Eastern under "white," and some of my Arab friends, some of whom are very light skinned, don't consider themselves as such.  




  deport his arse

I'm going to have to see his passport. His Americanness is in doubt for using the word "arse." 




  what were the whitecaps playing for

The fans, and not some silly yo-yo quest?  




 By that logic, why do you think international friendlies exist?

 Oh boy, I'd start by searching in this subreddit for terms like "Mike Petke."  




 LOL, it's cool. Adderall + Reddit when one is supposed to be studying probably is a lethal combination, though. 




  Then who is playing Left Mid? 

Graham Zusi. 

 




  It's pretty obvious to me that Chandler is one of the top few RBs in the player pool

Eric Lichaj, Jonathan Spector and Michael Parkhurst haven't gotten calls lately, and perhaps they should. 
 




 Hey El Tri, if you can't stand the heat, stay away from Kitchen? 




 They are, but citizenship isn't going to take effect until about September.  




 I would be looking at Kitchen as heir apparent to Beckerman, but that's just me.  




 So he's basically a younger Beckerman, who needs to work on his offensive skills?  




 I honestly didn't see any sort of clear explanation of any kind, which is why I was incredulous. Your reasoning kind of seemed fake, to be honest. I don't care who you support, but I was curious as to why you hated this team.  




 **Submission Statement**

I'll quote from the article: 

"This is the first in a three-part investigative series on Chinas inroads in Texas energy industry. It follows [an investigative series](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/1/26/chinas-louisiana-jindal-methanol-plant-environment-racism.html) on another push by Chinese politician-investors and U.S. officials for a methanol plant in a predominantly black neighborhood of St. James Parish, Louisiana."

In this article, Al Jazeera investigates US and Chinese interests behind a bid for $4.5 billion methanol plant in an underserved black community. 









 They were happy a goal was scored after a goalkeeper mistake? What fans in the world wouldn't be happy with that? If you're mad at that reaction, imagine if it was a British goal off an American keeper's miscue. The reaction, gloating and mockery would be 100 times worse.  




 Shouldn't you despise him instead... 




 WE'RE GONNA HAVE A MONTAGE 




 Ivesgate is about ethics in MLS journalism. 

      I'm sorry, I'm sorry 




 Isn't it amazing, how, probably just four years ago, everyone was hating the fact that Klinsmann was calling Beckerman into national team camps?  




 Thierry Henry also praised Connor Lade, someone who has to fight for minutes on his team, lest we forget. 
 




 That will give him, like, another 7 inches.
