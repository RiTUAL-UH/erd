 I think you're referring to the opioid AH-7921. 




 Super Smash Bros. Melee 




 Wow I'm a bit surprised nobody's recognized it yet since this is reddit and there are usually tons of CS/programmer types lurking around. But yeah I'm a software engineer. 




 lol I like your use of ASM in your flair. 




 Miralax or another laxative. 




 Yeah oxymorphone (Opana) is more potent than oxycodone on a mg to mg basis. 




 Yes, but I've only taken methylphenidate orally. I would say EPH is more euphoric then MPH but it doesn't last as long. EPH is also caustic and burns when you snort it, which is a good enough reason for me to moderate my use and keep my sinuses from getting too damaged. 




 I'd say ethylphenidate is the closest you're going to get to coke in the RC market. It's an NDRI that gives a decent rush when snorted. 




 I've vaped it off aluminum foil with a lighter and a straw. Bit of a waste but it works so I can't complain. 




 I noticed your username, have you tried vaping 3-fluorophenmetrazine? It's a nice rush but very short lived. I really like it. 




 Yeah I think it popped up in November on the RC market. In my experience 20mg snorted provides brief euphoria that gives way to 2-3 hours of functional stimulation. Less euphoria than EPH but I noticed less vasoconstriction as well. Similar burn to EPH when you snort it. May be caustic. Also, people have reported being pleased with how it vapes off foil and gives a pleasant rush. Personally I wouldn't vape more than 5-10mg though.  
  
For reference I have a moderate to low stimulant tolerance. Remember that RCs can affect everyone differently, so start small with dosing if you get your hands on some. Check out the 3F-phenmetrazine thread on Bluelight for more info :) 




 Jesus OP please don't follow this advice. Please don't give out dosage advice for substances that you aren't familiar with, especially a substance as unpredictable as heroin. Nobody should be doing more than 5-10mg at a time snorted without a tolerance, and that should only be after snorting ~1mg to test potency. Heroin has the potential to be cut with the opioid fentanyl, which is active in microgram doses and can significantly increase the risk of CNS depression. Even when taking dosing precautions such as these, you're still playing with fire and I don't recommend it. Stay safe, you can always take more but you can never take less. 




 I would say low dose ethylphenidate complements alcohol well, as well as 3-fluorophenmetrazine. I feel that their short durations allow you to fall asleep more easily at the end of the night than you would if you were on amphetamines.  
  
I tend to start with a small dose (~20mg) early in the night and redose one or two times throughout depending on how much I drink.  
edit: added dosage in case people are curious 




 I've only read about it but people seem to compare it to meth. I'm interested in your thoughts on that. Also what dosage did you take and which ROA? 




 I'm an atheist, but if there is a god then he's probably pretty angry with me for all of my hedonistic pursuits. 




 Very jealous, hope you enjoy it. What quantity did you get/how much was it? 




 Holy shit 600mg oxy at once? Can you elaborate more on your tolerance? 




 You sound angry, maybe you should do some dope. 




 My understanding is that if the final product of the diacetylmorphine hcl synthesis is washed well enough then it will smell less like vinegar. The vinegar smell is from a chemical leftover from the synthesis. 









 Good looks man that's an amazing trade. IR's too! Enjoy! 




 Hi there. I'm counting down the days til im able to cop a g of ECP for $80. Two weeks left til my guy comes back from vacation. I'm an occasional user since I've managed to convince myself that using more than twice a month will ruin my life :) All the dope porn on this sub keeps me happy while I wait to cop. Hope you're well OP! 




 Thanks for the replies everyone. I've decided to try 0.5mg with the subs next time. I'll have people around in case something goes wrong. 




 Hi /r/opiates, I've been lurking for a while and now I have a question.   
  
I have a few 24mg suboxones that I've been chopping into 16ths and snorting. This gets me pretty relaxed. I find subs pretty recreational during my breaks from H but I use infrequently. I'm looking to try clonazepam at the same time but I'm not sure what dosage I should start with. I'm aware that mixing benzos and opiates can be fatal. Cheers! 




 oooh shit hydromorph contins 




 You could cut up some lines and scrape them into little baggies, then when you want to snort it take a small straw and snort it straight from inside the baggie. Very fast and discrete way to do a line. 




 I agree with your once a month sentiment, it's been working pretty well for me so far. I've found that the best part about using opiates once a month is how your tolerance essentially resets after waiting so long. 




 Oh I see. Tolerance is a bitch. I'm a very infrequent user, so "not feeling it" has never been an issue (except if I get really shitty H). Stay safe.
