 Yessir. I will make it happen. 




 I try to do a bit of both. Women are 51% of the population, so they should be represented as much (if not 1% more) than men. There are a lot of instances where I just don't specify the gender so the reader can fill in the blanks. It doesn't work in all cases, though. When I can't, I try to cycle between dudes and dudettes. 




 Last week, I spotted a chilling headline hidden in my community newspaper. It was nested deep within its pages, between an article on tree pollination and a call for submissions on plumbing services --- the kind of mind-numblingly boring stuff people tend to skip over. Normally, I would have missed it, but my bus was stuck in a nasty traffic jam, and the paper was my only means of distraction. That's why the eerie headline caught my attention. It read:

*The Human Library  This Weekend Only!*

The words *Human Library* stuck out like a rusted nail in a children's playground, evoking a feeling of paranoid dread. I envisioned a mad scientist showing off his unethical collection of partially-dissected human remains. Perhaps some of his victims were still alive, unable to move or speak, but were screaming for help on the inside. The horrible thought sent a shiver down my spine. However, when I read the description accompanying the headline, I realized the event wasn't quite as sinister as its name suggested. *The Human Library* was a pilot project run by the local library where regular people from various professions were invited to sit down and answer questions. Think of it as a career fair, without the recruitment aspect. You could essentially "borrow" a human to learn about their life. It was an intriguing idea, and I figured it'd be the perfect activity to do with my kid sister.

When Saturday morning came, my little sister ran excitedly into my room to wake me. She was already dressed and ready to go, whipping her library card back and forth while squealing something in a tone so high-pitch that I couldn't make out the words. I replied by throwing my pillow at her face and rolling over to doze off. Unfortunately, I left myself open for retaliation. I'll spare you the gory details, but I should have known better than to give my only weapon to a hyperactive seven-year-old. The one-sided pillow fight that ensued would have given PTSD to even the toughest of men.

When we arrived at the library, we followed the signage to a large conference room at the back of the building. A bunch of families were already roaming about, speaking to the different guests. None was busier than the table in the far corner, which, as far as I could see, featured a firefighter. He wasn't wearing the full uniform: just a shirt with a logo on it. It would have been unreasonable to expect him to wear the undoubtedly hot get-up all day long. Judging by the flock of children fawning over his every word, and single mothers gawking at his stupidly muscular body, I could tell his choice of attire hadn't negatively impacted him whatsoever.

My sister, who was dressed as Princess Anna because kids have absolutely no shame wearing costumes in public even if it isn't Halloween, tugged on my shirt, and pointed to the firefighter. *Typical*, I thought. Firefighters and other "heroes" were like catnip for kids.

"Y'know, big brother is so much cooler than that guy," I told my sis, as I tried to steer her towards another guest.

She snickered and nudged me playfully, "You're so jelly you've got peanut butter belly! Jelly jelly peanut butter belly!"
 
"You make a good point," I relented, unable to come up with a proper comeback to the amazing burn she'd dished out.

If she wanted to be like every other stereotypical kid, then so be it. I; however, had no intention of being the only guy standing in a crowd of kids and moms. It would have been awkward and creepy, so I explored the other tables while she had her fun.

Having never been particularly comfortable around large groups, I gravitated towards the only unoccupied table. Behind it stood a large, burly man wearing a stained beige apron. His arms were crossed high above his chest, feeding the already hostile energy emanating form him. Strong, callused fingers scratched at his bearded chin. When he looked at me, he seemed to sneer at my admittedly inferior form. I felt my throat tighten, my muscles tense, and my head retreat towards my shoulders.

"S-so," I started, my voice crackling, "  W-what do *you* do?"

The man shifted his weight, then leaned forward, slamming his massive hands against the table firmly, "I'm a butcher," he replied, his tone sharp and authoritative.

Even when leaning, the man towered over me like a Neanderthal warrior. I could feel sweat collecting on my forehead, like dew on a dandelion. Compared to him, I was probably just as frail as one, too.

"Uhn  what  what do you like about your job?" I questioned uncomfortably.

He smirked lightly, barely giving the question any thought, "Watching the animals take their final breaths."

The twisted gleam of enjoyment in his eyes made me shiver uncontrollably, "O-oh."

"Especially the calves," he continued, though I wish he hadnt, "It's almost as though *they know* what's going to happen to them. Their fear makes them even more tender and juicy," he answered, still smirking deviously.

Meanwhile, I could hear the kids around the firefighter screaming "ME! ME! ME!" excitedly. At least *they* were having fun.

I regretted not sticking with my sister. It would have spared me from being forced to listen to what was undeniably a serial killer masquerading as a butcher. Our conversation continued, growing ever more disturbing by the moment. He described, in horrid detail, the slithering sound of guts being pulled and the weight of cow intestines in his hands. He said "cow", but we both knew he meant his countless human victims. He gesticulated how he cut them open and carved their meat, inhaling deeply as he smelled their fresh organs. He was so into it, that I could even see his pupils dilate and sweat form on his brow. I needed him to stop: I didn't want to hear this killer's confessions.

Taking a step back, I hesitantly mumbled, "Ri-right, I uh. I ought to get going."

As I was about to walk away, he gripped my shoulder tightly. With barely any effort, he twisted me around so he could look me in the eyes. His breath wreaked of week-old sausages and beer.

His bushy eyebrows twisted downwards as he gazed at me with his fierce green eyes, "Here," he said, slipping something into my jacket pocket.

*Oh god*, I thought. What had he given me? A human bone? An eye? A photo of his next victim? I was too scared to check. Too afraid that he would drag me out to his meat locker and gut me like he'd done with his other "cows". I forced a nervous smile, bowed my head respectfully, and mumbled a meek 'thank you' as I headed towards the other end of the room.

It was then that I noticed the firefighter and his crowd of eager followers were gone. I kicked myself for not checking on my sister sooner, but I figured she'd dispersed with the other kids and was stalking another guest. Hopefully she hadn't found her way to the butcher. I did *not* want to deal with the tantrum she'd have if she found out what happened to Bo Beep's sheep. Thankfully, she wasn't anywhere near him. After a quick scan of the area failed to produce her, I got a little worried. 

I walked to the main desk and approached the librarian in charge, giving her a half-hearted wave, "You seen a kid wearing a *Frozen* dress walk by here, by any chance?" I asked her.

She shook her head, but smiled calmly, "I bet she's in the play area. Follow me," she answered.

She brought me to an open space full of toys, puzzles, and excited kids. I couldnt see my sister among the group. Hoping one of them had seen her, I knelt down and tried to get their attention.

"Have any of you seen Princess Anna walking around?" I asked.

A boy playing with building blocks smiled and pointed towards the back door, "She got to ride with the firefighter!" he answered.

I let out a sigh of relief. *Of course* she'd go see the fire engine. What kid wouldn't? My relief was short lived, dissipating when I noticed the librarian turning as white as a ghost.

"What firefighter?" she asked, her tone stressed.

"The one you guys invited to The Human Library," I answered.

I'm not even sure if I heard her reply, or if the look on her face conveyed the message for me. One way or another, I received the message loud and clear: there hadn't been a firefighter there that day.

Stomach twisting in knots, I bolted towards the door as quickly as my feet could take me, screaming my sister's name at the top of my lungs. I could hear the librarian and nearby parents gasping. Everything became a blur as I ran into the street, eyes darting back and forth for any clue as to her whereabouts. One of her shoes was lying outside an alley. In an instant, I turned into an adrenaline-fueled Superman, flying towards that alley and ripping through any obstacle in my way.

"LEGGO!!!" I heard my sister scream.

I could see her in the distance, my vision tunneling around her. She was feisty for a little kid, putting up an impressive fight against whoever was dragging her towards the opposite end. My chest was burning with pain, but I ignored it. I had to save my sister.

"YOU LET HER GO YOU BASTARD!" I shouted.

The next few moments were disjointed and out of focus, as though I was watching a low-quality movie spliced together at random. I heard tires shrieking, I saw my sister fall to the ground, and I noticed the general shape of a car speeding down the road. My momentum brought me staggering past my sister and into the street. I spun on my heels, picked her up, and checked her over while she sobbed loudly. Id never felt so relieved in my life.

"Heeeeey kiddo, it's okay. It's okay. I've got ya." I whispered, petting her head.

She was trying to say something, but I couldn't understand a word of it through her cries. She seemed awfully upset, but I couldn't blame her for it. She'd been through a lot.

We headed back towards the library. As I walked, I felt something poking into my side. I realized it was the thing the butcher had given me earlier. I reached into my pocket and pulled it out, emitting an inappropriate laugh. It was a 15% off coupon for a butcher shop in town. I laughed so hard that tears fell from my eyes. After regaining my composure, I pocketed the card, and walked into the library.

A frantic-looking woman shuffled over, her mascara running down her cheeks, W-wheres Cynthia? she asked, in panic.

My heart, which had been beating rapidly seconds before, came to a complete halt. I was so focused on getting my sister back, that I never even considered she wasn't the only child taken. An influx of guilt at the realization made my knees buckle, and I had to prop myself against the wall to stay upright. My sister continued to cry, her earlier pleas finally sinking in. She had tried to tell me, but I foolishly failed to understand.

I stood there, the reality dawning on me and freezing me in place. The woman begged me to give her any detail --- a license plate number, the make and model of the car --- anything. I hadnt even thought to check. The worst is that, as I racked my brain trying to remember, a passing image came to my mind. I had seen her. Just for a second, I had seen the other child biting the attacker, causing him to drop my sister. Id been so caught up with helping my sis that I failed to realize it at the time. And now, I think Cynthias going to be part of a whole different kind of *Human Library*. 




 Oh ho hooooo, you fooled me good! Guess I should stop putting the cart before the horse and read before I judge! 




 I would highly recommend [Bye Bye Moving](http://byebyemovingottawa.com). They offer good rates and do a great job. I've used them twice now and have always been more than satisfied.

They're also really impressive to watch. I have this heavy living room table with a ceramic top. Takes at LEAST two people to lift it. A single one of these guys can move it around no problem. It's insane. 




 My interest is definitely piqued. 




 Note to self: include 'pique' in every single story moving forward. 




 The lime-flavored ones are the best. Mmmmmmm. 




 It annoys the heck out of me when *I* get it wrong, which is more often than I care to admit. Piqued isn't a problem, but *peeked* and *peaked* are just so visually similar that I don't catch those errors when revise my text. I'd love to blame my autocorrect on being a jerk, but I'm pretty sure it's just my lack of attention to detail.

You're missing one, though:

Peacocked - meaning to have a peacock flung into one's face.

*The man peeked over the peak of the mountain, his interest having be piqued by the sound of a hundred thousand limbless torsos rolling along the valley on the other side. Alas, as he peered over the edge, he was peacocked.*

*Edited for italics. 




 Do not approach the dog park.

There are no dogs allowed in the dog park.

People are not allowed in the dog park.

It is possible that you will see hooded figures in the dog park.

Do not approach them.

 That was absolutely ADORABLE. 




 **I must acquire them all.**

 It depends on *where* your condo is located and what amenities are included (pools, garages, etc.  = $$$).

I pay under 150$ a month on condo fees. 500-900$ a month seems insane to me, but it's all about location, location, location.

Think of it this way: a condo is like a house, except you don't have to take care of the lawn or shovelling. Plus, when repairs are needed, you're not the *only* person paying for it. A house is as much of a money-losing asset as a condo isbut maintaining it will likely cost you more in the long run.

I.e. A condo's roof might be bigger than a house's roof, but it's not THAT MUCH bigger. I'm going to throw a completely random number out there just to make a point, so don't quote me on this, but let's pretend a regular roof is, I don't know 2 000 square feet (again, random, unfounded number). Well, a condo's roof is maybe 5 000 square feet. Sure, it's bigger than a house's roof, but you're splitting the cost of repairing it between 12 households instead, which ends up costing you less. 




 There's nothing wrong about hiding in the bushes outside his house, OKAY?! Stop trying to make me feel bad about it! 




 Very true! WE'RE A HOOT. Get it? Because we're actually OWLS. HAhahahoooo hooooo hoooo.

(T_T That made no sense.) 




 Awesome, thanks! :D I wasn't even CLOSE to finding it. Wowsah, it DID get a lot of upvotes. Just goes to show that we don't always need to be funny! Yay for the NoSleep humorless clique! :D 




 ...I'm frantically searching through my post history to find it. Hahaha. Curious Manen is curious indeed. 




 Another excellent narration, Yara! :) 




 In case you *don't* have a Costco membership, Canadian Tire also sells propane for a fairly OK price. 




 Ah, man. That absolutely sucks. I hope you can recover your money somehow. :( 




 I'm sorry you went through hard times, but I'm glad you're doing better now. 




 I like concrete. It's cool. When you zoom in, you see a bunch of little pebbles. 




 Awesome! I love it! :D 




 Shhh  surrender yourself to the stories. The stories are living, breathing, writhing things that want to be told. We don't write them because we *want* to, we write them because they force us to. 




 Oh, thank goodness. That's much less frighteni-WAIT. 




 What is that monstrous face on the top-right of the dashboard? (Over the 6 circles.) 




 Please don't punch me again. :( 




 If you start a story that way, I will read it all the way through, I promise. 




 I don't have a best comment. Manen is a sad, humorless person. :( 




 I try not to let little details bother me, but I agree that people can get stuck in clichd versions of behaviors/jobs/locations. Unless it's pivotal to the story, I'll just ignore it. People get shrinks wrong all the time, but usually the story revolves around their client and the spooky stuff that happens to them, y'know? Maybe they're describing the most grossly inaccurate psychiatrist ever, but if the rest of the story holds up, I'll turn a blind eye. If you're writing a story about how you were a firefighter and something weird happened in an inferno but you haven't done even the slightest bit of research and describe the equipment and procedures completely wrong, then, yeah, that's another issue altogether.


Y'know what they say: when in doubt, set the story 50 years in the past, where no one can check for inaccuracies.


My biggest pet peeve is when someone starts the story by pointing out that they're not a writer. Honestly, if I see that, I exit out of the story immediately.


Fun fact: there's a historical statue near my workplace of some  dude who  uh, sailed or something. In his hand is an astrolabe. Turns out that the statue is holding it upside-down. Few people know or notice, and those who do don't really care, because the point is "Let's celebrate this famous historical figure". 




 I hope to feature a reading of this story on my YouTube channel :D

Ooooh, that'd be awesome. :) 




 Gracias. :) 




 All right, thank you. :) I do have a permanent position where I am at the moment, so I won't pursue the matter.

That said, perhaps one day I will have the pleasure to work with you. 




 ... Hmm ... Perhaps that would be do-able. *Perhaps*

In all seriousness. Is this a contract position? My curiosity is piqued. 




 Coding accessible HTML 5 websites is my home slice. I can do it in my sleep. 




 Hahahahahaha! Maybe that's what it was. 




 Thanks for catching the mistake (and for your kind words). Fixed it! 




 Hahahahaha! 




 The flag flew at half-mast, clinging to a rusted pole atop a crumbling building coated in roots and vines.

When the invaders came, we were given a choice: fight, or surrender. We proudly chose to fight with all our might.

First came the drones, raining death from the above. Even on the sunniest of days, the clear blue sky instilled fear in the hearts of all who dared to leave their shelter.

Next were the soldiers. Their rallying cries echoed in the distance. The front line drew closer and closer to our homes, until they waged wars and held siege right outside our doors. Still, we did not surrender.

Then came the biological weapons. Yellow haze blinded brave men and women fighting for their nation. Clouds of emerald melted their skin and infected their minds. They lived on, in agony, until the morning of the red fog. Their blood boiled and evaporated, covering the landscape in a crimson steam.

The worst was the sabotage. We decided that, if we couldn't have our land, no one would. We poisoned the crops, killed the animals, and polluted the waters until there was nothing left, not even for our own survival. Our children were the first to die. Unaware of the danger, some ate tainted food supplies, others died of starvation, and some simply melted into our rivers of acid. The bodies we could find were buried in unmarked graves or thrown in overflowing ditches along unpaved roads.

Finally came the mushroom clouds, the last nail in humanity's coffin. They rendered the world inhospitable for the few remaining survivors. Before long, all that was left was a wasteland of bones and morphed shadows clinging to broken walls.

Turned white by acid rain, bleached by the sun, and worn by time, the flag continued to sway gently in the breeze. In the end, it was not a nation or its people that surrendered: it was humanity itself. And so, the white flag flew at half-mast for a species too proud to survive. 




 I have definitely heard and seen some really weird stuff, but I don't actually believe in spirits, so I always attributed it to magnetic fields. They can really mess with your sense of perception.

That said, the strangest one I encountered was when I was in high school. I had braces back then, so I got in the habit of brushing my teeth straight after supper. I was in the bathroom upstairs when I saw the reflection of a figure standing in the doorway. This is the kind of thing when, in movies, the person turns around and the figure is gone, right? Well, I turned, but it was STILL there. I'm not saying it was headless, but I didn't *notice* a head. Just a long flowing white dress and light purple detailing. She turned around and walked into my sister's room. I followed her, thinking my sister was messing with me, but the room was empty.

I walked downstairs, saying "Hahaha, real funny, guys." because I was convinced they were pranking me. But then, I saw my mom, dad, and sister all sitting on the couch watching TV. They looked at me like they had no idea what I was talking about. 




 My first one lasted a couple years, I think? The second went on for barely a year. The last lasted a few months, then I gave up on webcomics for good. 




 Weeeebcooomiiiiiiiics!

Fun fact: I used to draw webcomics back in my youth. Ah, those were the days. 




 Fear is pretty subjective. What works for one person might not work for someone else. People who have kids, for example, might relate to the stories where children die from an unknown illness, and might be more inclined to be frightened by those tales.

But, hey, that's the beauty of NoSleep: you find pretty much everything here. From psychological horror to guts and gore, and everything in between. (Except psycho-murdering unicorns. I am very disappointed that no one has written a story about them.) 




 Thank you. ;D 




 I'm at work right now, so here's what [my office looks like](http://36.media.tumblr.com/41b6aa87fba94c99a26de41cc02f1a1b/tumblr_npmzmkHC3D1uqw4jao1_1280.jpg). 




 1. Your real story might just not have gotten any traction. It doesn't mean it was good or bad. Sometimes, good stories get swept under the rug, where they join a bunch of corpses that have been rotting there for years.
2. It's actually against the rules to comment on a story saying you should tl;dr it. This is a writing sub. If they're not willing to read, then they're the problem, not you. You go ahead and keep it as long as you want. If it's a good story, "they" will come. ("They" being either the undead, or readers.)
3. Don't turn it into a throwaway if you don't want to. Just tag your posts accordingly. There's nothing wrong with your username producing completely different styles of stories, touching on different subject matters. 




 You just made my monday morning. xD 




 Maybe he meant "stu**d**"?

This is definitely not the right place, as NoSleep is full of studs and stud-ettes. ;D 




 he'd wake up sick or in cold sweats randomly, or he would get extremely paranoid on some days, hearing people pound on his door etc.

Sounds like you're describing Monday mornings. 




 Don't worry, I'm here for you!

Except if you want me to rewatch Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. NEVER AGAIN. NEVEEER. 




 [Shin Sekai Yori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be0HqIhC48c)'s theme is also downright haunting. (WE ARE SUCH NERDS, badfakesmiles!!! SUCH NERDS.) 




 Nice to talk to you as well! Come hang out in the chatroom one of these days! 




 Hahaha no worries. The only way I can keep all the authors straight is by using a super-detailed spreadsheet of every single story they wrote. (I may or may not be joking.) 




 Thank you for your kind words!

I definitely did not write the lost town story, though. Not big on writing series---too afraid they'll get hated into oblivion. Manen's a very self-concious fellow. 




 I usually start at the newest story and just read in order, reading back until I have to do something else or until I'm done.

You are my hero. Good on you for not starting with the popular stories. I wish more people would do this.

I almost always either vote up or down.

Oooouh, slight hero-points removed for this, though. I get what your reasoning is, but I personally feel that downvotes should be used extremely sparingly. I see it this way:

* Upvote: I enjoyed this.
* No vote: I disliked it.
* Downvote: I HAVE BEEN OFFENDED GREATLY BY THIS AND WANT TO SEE THE AUTHOR AND ALL OF HIS WORK FAIIIIIL!

As a result, I avoid downvoting. I prefer letting the story die naturally. If it's bad, then it probably won't get many upvotes any way. If it just isn't my taste, then at least I'm not hindering the writer and preventing others from reading the story. (A single downvote can be the difference between staying on Nosleep's main page, and disappearing into oblivion.) If the story breaks the rules, then I report it. That's how I see it.

 I never considered it, no, but it's an entertaining thought. It'd probably make for an interesting story. Mind you, a lot of the "advice"  is so incredibly ridiculous that you wouldn't -think- someone would follow it. I.e. "BURN THE HOUSE DOWN!" Obviously, no one's going to be gullible enough to do that, but someone might be inclined to follow some slightly less exaggerated advice. Hmmm... 




 I think it's all about momentum. If you're lucky and have a few upvotes early on, then your story will do well. If not, then it'll be buried underneath a mountain of other stories (and might get criticized).

Keep in mind that the majority of voters *aren't* fellow writers. They are super-sexy regular people who just want to read something scary. If your story manages to make them hide in the closet, then grammar and spelling mistakes probably won't matter that much. 




 Please forgive me, Rodriguez! I promise to use fabric softener on you tonight, even though I'm allergic! 




 It's not the mods' job to go through the stories and tag them. It's up to the authors to tag their stories.

There are a variety of reasons why a story might go unfinished. I understand that it's frustrating, and I'm sorry it bothers you. I'm not saying you don't have a valid complaint: just that you're directing it at the wrong people. It would be impossible for the mods to keep track of **all** the stories and tag them.

You might want to check out [The Nosleep Index Series Compilation](http://www.reddit.com/r/NosleepIndex/wiki/index) if you want to read series, but want to make sure they're complete.

Edit: I made a horrendous spelling mistake that SHAMED me. Shamed me, I tell you. It needed to be fixed, lest I shame not only myself, but my ancestors! 




 I'd say that kind of falls under "breaking immersion", which is a big no-no. That said, in your post, you *are* allowed to include **subtle** links to your website(s).

Most people who do this either hyperlink a random word in their story, or put an "X" at the bottom  and hyperlink it.

What you definitely DON'T want to do is this: "YO FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER"


 




  Why waste time on old stories when you've got a slew of new skills and experiences at your disposal and you could just create something new?

For the same reason we renovate homes instead of building new ones: it creates jobs which, in turn, helps the economy grow. DO YOU HATE THE ECONOMY, KNEEOD?!

No, no wait. That definitely doesn't make sense. Let me try again.

Because  it keeps away the termites? Yeah. That's the reason. Termites. Let's keep them away.

(I can see the benefit of wanting to rework a story. Sometimes, you love the idea, but hate how it was applied, and want another kick at the can. I'd be inclined to go back and fix some of my stories if/when I release an anthology. 'Cause the formatting on some of my earlier ones makes my eyes bleed. And some of them weren't up to par. And termites. TERMITES EVERYWHERE.) 




 That's a pretty good question. Judging by your post title, I was going to send you to /r/NoSleepReruns/, but this is a little different.


 wise mods, what think ye? 




 Don't we all? ;) 




 I definitely think something is going on, I'll give you an update on my findings tomorrow!!!



IF I SURVIVE.

: P 




 There's a **No Series** filter at the top of the page. 




 goodness, WHAT HAVE I UNLEASHED INTO THE WORLD?! My creation --- it's a monster. A *monster*, I tell you! 




 No, it did *good*. It climbed trees to rescue kittens, helped old ladies cross the street, and even helped fund a new roof for the community centre.
 




 Ok! Noogie time! :) 




 Thank you so much. :3 




 Once you're *dead* and *spread* into ashes, people will finally see your true value, just like the great painters of the past! :D 




 [I was a decoy in a police line-up](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3625oc/i_was_a_decoy_in_a_police_lineup_but_it_all_went/) 




 I'll grind up grindhorse and make glue out of him for you! You probably just posted your story(ies) at a bad time. 




 This. Absolutely. Yes. 




 I  uhm  I feel *really* uncomfortable saying this, because I like to think I'm reasonably modest, but one could say that I'm a somewhat successful writer on NoSleep. I once posted a story on a throwaway just to see if it'd be popular even if it wasn't attached to this somewhat successful screename. I guess for my ego? I don't know.


I can't speak for the other authors, but that's why I did it. Just to prove to myself that people didn't *just* like my stuff because I had a few successful stories.


As it turns out, the throwaway story did good, so at least I didn't wind up CRUSHING MY OWN EGO TO LITTLE BITS AND PIECES LIKE A HUMPTY DUMPTY OF FAILURE.
