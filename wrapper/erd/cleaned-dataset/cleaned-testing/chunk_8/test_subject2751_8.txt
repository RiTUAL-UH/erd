 Based on your ratings, we have a pretty similar taste in euro games. The most suitable one is probably **Argent: the Consortium** where you use minis as workers for worker placement. It's decent with 2 players but probably best at 3-4.

Otherwise, minis usually mean thematic RPG (**Arcadia Quest**), Co-ops (**Mice and Mystics**) or map based area control games which only excels at high player count (**Kemet**, **Cyclades**). 




 A lot of people don't update their ratings to games, so BGG top 100 will never represent "the best 100 games out there" but rather "the Hall of Fame of 100 games". That's the reason why some successors and the original games are both in the top 100 (e.g. **War of the Ring**, **Imperial 2030** etc) 









 It's a neat little game that is fun to bring out every once in a while - best when you have actually forgotten about everything you did in your previous game. That's because it's completely deterministic. There is no random setup. The same buildings always comes out at a fixed time. Therefore I do not recommend replaying it frequently. 




 I do not recommend Bohnanza for 5p. Trading becomes too easy, and the game lasts too long for what it is. 




 I think so. When introducing a new game to a group, some basic labeling would help you find the right crowd. For example, "an area control game about engine-building and resource management (~Euro)" receives attention from a different crowd than "an area control game about betrayal and hidden identity (~Amerithrash)".

It's not about whether one is better than which. It's just a quick and simple way to identify with the right crowd. 




 Long-term goals: Grow to 4-5 dwarves, fill up most of your board, find 2-3 ways to accumulate a lot of points. Unlike Agricola, Caverna rewards specialising, not diversfying.

Mid-term goals: Food engine and dwellings. It might be sowing/ breeding/adventures/ eating resources. Whatever your strategy is, it's optimal to build corresponding rooms. 

Tactical choices: Rubies are extremely powerful. Uses include - getting a pair of animals before breeding, digging a tunnel to build a mine, getting veg and grain before sowing, going out of turn for a big adventure etc. It's good to keep 1-2 rubies in front of you to keep your opponents nervous. 




 Solo: **Mage Night**

2-p: **Castles of Burgundy**

3-p: **Le Havre**

4-p: **Terra Mystica**

5-p: **El Grande**

6-p: **Pictomania**

7+: None. I'd rather split the group into 2 games. 




 It sounds like a co-op game would fit all 3 criteria.

**Shadowrun: Crossfire** games are relatively short and you can set your own difficulty. It also incorporates permanent upgrades to your characters as you play the game repeatedly.

**Robinson Crusoe** is a co-op survival game that scales from 1 to 4 players. 




 If that's the only criteria, [this](https://boardgamegeek.com/search/boardgame?sort=bggrating advsearch=1 q= include%5Bdesignerid%5D= include%5Bpublisherid%5D= geekitemname= range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bminage%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bnumvoters%5D%5Bmin%5D=100 range%5Bnumweights%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bminplayers%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bmaxplayers%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bleastplaytime%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bplaytime%5D%5Bmax%5D= floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmin%5D=7 floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmax%5D=10 floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmin%5D=4 floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmax%5D=5 colfiltertype= searchuser=test_subject2751 nosubtypes%5B0%5D=boardgameexpansion playerrangetype=normal B1=Submit) is probably what you're after.

But **Mage Knight**, **Kanban**/**Vinhos**, **18xx**, **Here I Stand**, **Twilight Imperium** are all heavy games that are on par with Through the Ages but they are vastly different games. It would therefore be more helpful if you provide more information:  What did you like/dislike about Through the Ages? What's your usual player count? 




 Games new to me:

**The Doge Ship** - An average worker placement game. I'm usually up for dry euros, but I feel like there's mostly tactical play in this game and not enough strategy. 

**Formula D** - We played the base game only. A lot of probabilities and calculations involved, but I'd say it's a good game if you don't take the dice rolls too seriously.

Games that I've played before:

**Kanban** - taught it to 3 newbies but they all got on quickly. It's always a blast making jokes about office culture and meetings during the game.

**Panamax** - Probably my second favourite in 2014 after Kanban. Taking the offshore account card secured my win.

**Castles of Mad King Ludwig** - Probably my third favourite in 2014 still. The score updating is still a bit fiddly and the presence of AP players are what my ratings down.

**Agricola** x2 - Made a huge mistake that I probably will not forget whenever I play Agricola in the future....after having the baking tray I used the Major Improvement space to build the clay oven as I forgot that it could be built as a Minor Improvement. Lesson learnt at a severe cost.

**Splendor** - I still enjoy the game as a filler but probably will not voluntarily suggest bringing it out any more. 




 Have you tried the **Terra Mystica Fire and Ice Expansion** yet? It changes the base game quite a lot.

I'm pretty sure you would enjoy **Panamax**, **Kanban**, **Vinhos**, and **Brass**. 




 I recommend trying at [London On Board](http://www.meetup.com/LondonOnBoard/events/). There's a meetup practically every day and it's quite easy to find people to join Eclipse. I have seen it played every other week. 




 Borrowing examples from well known games:

Ownership of buildings that other players may use at a cost (**Le Havre**, **Lords of Waterdeep**, **Keyflower**)

Anything with area control (**Belfort**, **Dominant Species**)

Sharing stakes in the same company (**Imperial 2030**, **Panamax**, **Chicago Express**) 




 Yup. It's not about drawing well, it's about highlighting key concepts and getting it done quickly so you can start guessing other people's drawings. 




 **Pictomania** is a ton of fun, I highly recommend it. In a N player game, each round there will be a 7 x N matrix of items/events/ideas and players are assigned a specific column and row to draw (e.g., Column X, Row 3). Therefore, you are already certain that no-one else is drawing anything from Row 3. Drawing and guessing happens simultaneously, and you receive points if other players guess your drawing correctly and vice versa, with a speed bonus.

Players are rewarded for **creativity** - expressing themselves concisely, **deduction** - sort of sudoku like when you're not entirely sure what other players are drawing, and **boldness** - making quick guesses on other players' drawings. 

A minor con to the game is that it tests players' knowledge on actual historical figures (e.g. King Arthur), objects (e.g. U boat vs shipping boat) and pop culture (how do you draw the 7 books of Harry Potter differently?). Obviously if players get uncomfortable these cards could be removed by player consensus when they are drawn. 




 All pretty safe bets for ~4p games: **Lords of Waterdeep**, **Dead of Winter**, **Sheriff of Nottingham**, **Hanabi**, **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**, **Dominion**
