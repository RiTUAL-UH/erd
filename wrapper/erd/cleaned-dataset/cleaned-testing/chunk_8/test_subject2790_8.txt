 You've written in all caps so it *must* be true.  




 No problem, I'm getting jealous at all the options you have in the US. In the UK only a humanist celebrant, registrar or priest can marry you as far as I know.

I found [a link](http://humanist-society.org) to the Humanist Society in America, hopefully there's a celebrant in your area which gives you another option. 




 As a fellow bride with a strained relationship with my father - he won't even be coming to the wedding - I can see where your concern is coming from and massive Internet hugs to you.

Would a possible compromise be, as someone else suggested I'm sure, having your DJ play a song dedicated to your FH and FMIL but have the dance floor open to everyone? This would allow them to have their dance to a song of their choosing without the implications of a spotlight dance. 




 UK here, we're hoping to have a humanist celebrant marry us. We have to become a member of the humanist society for 2 years prior to the wedding  (they offer a package for engaged couples). Humanist ceremonies are much more personal than a traditional registrar and as FH and I are both atheists and marrying in an observatory it felt fitting.

 A glorious piece of modern art featuring liquid shit in the toilet bowl, vomit on the floor and period blood smeared on the wall. The tampon belonging to said blood was lying on top of the sanitary bin.
