 No Ragrets 




 Best game ever 




 Good lord man 




 You sure that isn't a weed issue? 




 When I realized some of the high school kids I coach were born in the year 2000. Mind blowing! 




 Human Centipede 




 I have never gotten any cool PM's. I figured if I stayed active on Reddit long enough and made enough funny comments maybe someone would show me their boobs or something. I was sadly mistaken. 




 Anything by Matoma or Kygo 




 Is it worth more than that?  




 Truer words have never been spoken 




 Damn, Afroman needs to puff one down and not deck chicks. Holy shit that was unnecessary.  




 Keep fighting the good fight brotha! 




 Doucheeeee! Douchheeeee! Douchenozzle!!!! 




 John Glenn, what a badass! 




 Why are there children sitting there watching that? 




 Does it grow packs of Jujubee's? Those are absolutely delicious! 




 I listed a house for sale. $2.1 million! 




 Police cop? 




 A beer bong 




 Fuck Tim Kawakami and everything he stands for. 




 Came here to post about Pennywise, glad it was already covered. 




 Majestic 




 Love it 




 That's awesome! 




 She was flying! 




 What it comes down to is that I'm borderline sexist and don't really find women ensemble casts that funny. If you enjoy those comedies though, who am I to judge. Carry on. 




 I'm well aware I can trade stocks on my own. My financial advisor is one of my best friends. He's very smart, knows the stock market more intimately than me and has invested my money quite successfully for me. I pick some stocks myself, but he also comes to me with ideas when I have some money to invest. It's a nice personal and professional relationship. 




 I'm quite happy to learn I don't know who was in Bridesmaids or who will be in this lame all-female reboot of a classic franchise. I'm not even defending Marvel movies per say, I'm just saying that this sounds like the worst movie idea I've ever heard. 




 You want to see a Ghostbusters movie with the same cast as Bridesmaids. I didn't really think I had to explain why I felt sorry for you, but there you go. 




 I feel really sad for you 




 You'd rather see an all-female Ghostbusters that will surely tarnish the good name of a proud movie franchise than something like Avengers: Age of Ultron? 




 I am rooting for Bane to blow up the whole stadium. Hooray Team Bane! 




 Thank god I didn't bail on my Apple stock a few months back when it wasn't looking so hot.

Edit: I just checked and apparently Apple went down over 3 points today. Apparently beating all the forecasts and making $18 billion dollars in one quarter isn't enough for Wall Street. I know nothing about the stock market haha.

Edit 2: Texted my financial advisor and fellow redditors reporting, up 6% after close. Profit reported after the close of the market. Feeling good again! 




 This gives me a freedom boner 




 Who cares... 




 Have you no decency sir? 




 Ask him why he sucks so much ass... 




 You like fishdicks? 




 37 Taco Bell crispy tacos 




 Your mom 




 Have your mom make it for me 




 Immediate divorce 




 TIL the meaning of Ents. It all makes so much sense now. 




 It's Booby D baby! 




 Just bought Matoma tickets for February in SF. Really pumped! 




 Enhance...Enhance...Enhance

Just print the fucking thing already 




 My apologies! She is quite majestic. I just got back from the snow with my Berner. I hated taking him away from it. He is so at peace in the mountains! 




 That hit me right in the feels 




 Love him! 




 Everything about this!!!
