 We both love cream of whatever soups, Gumbo, and things like Beouf Bourgignon, that require a coating of flour before searing the meat. Of course there are many soups that don't require flour, but I'd like to adapt our favorites to fit her needs. She was only recently diagnosed. 




 I have a dutch oven I got for my birthday a couple months ago that I still haven't broken in, but I'll ask her if she has utensils that haven't been tainted. 




 Sadly, there are no Trader Joe's here in Southern Indiana, but other replacements seem workable. 




 I am planning on making a bunch of soup for a friend with Celiac's. However, all of our favorites involve flour.

I know the obvious substitutions for thickening agents (cornstarch + water, instant mashed potatoes), but what about recipes where you need to cover chunks of meat with flour before searing (beouf bourgignon and the like)? Would rice or almond flour work for things like this?

She is completely broke (not like that "broke as a joke" post, she literally has $5 for the rest of the month), so I want to help her out as much as I can. I was planning on making several types of soup in the next few days anyway, but I never cook gluten free, since I don't have a problem with it.

What suggestions do you wonderful cooks have?

EDIT: thank you all for the suggestions! I will be making quite a few soups with your help this week. 




 Thanks, now I need to watch a bunch of Eyewitness mpvies to further my finals procrastination. 




 Keep supporting her. Since you said you also SH, that makes it a little easier. Suggest that she go to see a professional, but don't push it too much (I just went through something where my friends pushed too hard). Let her know that it hurts you when she hurts herself, and, if she doesn't already know, let her know that you suffer from the same thing.

Furthermore, do not EVER feel that you can help her pain by harming yourself. I know it can hurt, seeing someone you love harm themselves, but the only person who can help them is them. Do what you can, but always remember that. 




 I've met many cats who take worse pictures than Marshall Erikson. 




 Yeah, I always just get the "come over to feed them every day and they'll take care of themselves." Although I did leave both of mine with family when I was gone for a week this summer, but they are both basically dogs, so being alone for a wrek probably would have been bad for them. 




 I even love 21st Century Breakdown. Maybe because it came out when I was 17, maybe because Green Day has had a special place in my heart for as long as I can remember.

The rock opera thing was pretty bad, but if you treat it like any other album, I personally think it's pretty solid. 




 I had no idea that was why! 




 I always laughed when my ex farted near me, even if it smelled. He laughed less, but that's part of why he's an ex. 




 Great Pyrenees are also often crazy. A family friend fostered some for several years and they were all nuts. First one killed himself five minutes after they left by running around and wrapping the chain around his neck (15 minutes before the dogsitter arrived), the second was the only dog to ever bite me, the third and fourth had to be fostered by someone else because they tried to kill each other and the family cats. 




 My religious friends always said that it may be different for everyone. Like, for me it would be eternal winter, for some it would be eternity in a tiny room. Whatever would be the worst for you. 




 Not the same sex, but I introduced my second cat to a girl who was around the same age (11 months). They were snuggling after about a month. 




 I love the little freckled toes! 




 It isn't too hard to get rid of fleas. My apartment was infested when I moved in, so I just spent the night with a friend after deploying the flea bomb and gave my baby a bath with dish soap. 




 http://www.imgur.com/LtbVIyW.jpeg
I'm down! 




 Yup, both my domestic short hairs have it (salt and pepper tabby with a white tummy and ginger tabby), although it is more pronounced in the little baby salt and pepper girl. 




 It may not be food poisoning, but every time I've gone there in my 22 years living in Btown, I spend two days on the toilet spewing from both ends. Maybe we have some weird allergy, but it's still good to make sure. 




 Make sure the kids can handle it, though. I love Mother Bear's, but both my sister and I get violent food poisoning every time we go. I still indulge about once a year, but my sister and I aren't the only people I've heard this from. 




 I'm lazy enough that I don't go online. Try TIS first, then the bookstore. Don't expect anything back from novels (3 years as a French major taught me that), nor from custom books. It's pretty hit or miss, but I always get at least $20 back each semester. 




 I make croissants every couple months, and this is the best trick I've learned. 




 It's soo good. I think the place is called The Blue Moon, but I've never actually been. I've got family from right around there, so they bring some up every time they visit. 




 This! I also like to use a fifth of some liquor in a cylindrical bottle as a rolling pin. While the dough is chilling, put the bottle in the freezer. That way the pin won't warm up the dough too much. 




 I have no idea how they season or prepare it, but a tiny little hole in the wall in Owensboro, Kentucky has some of the best brisket I've ever had. Their mutton and pulled pork are better, but they're amazing. 




 Bloomington/Ellettsville chiming in, we call them potlucks. 




 Oh no, this reminded me that I have one to finish in the next three weeks! 




 The Guardian did a review, and it sounds as sub par as you'd expect. 




 Rabbit is amazing. A little gamey, but it tates like a mix of pork and lamb, from what I remember. I don't have any qualms eating it, because they're so prevalent. The phrase "fucking like rabbits" exists for a reason, 




 I've sadly only had it as sausage. Venison sausage is good, but doesn't have the same gamey flavor.

I have had rabbit, squirrel, and ostrich, though, which are all really good. 




 What I've always heard is "you have a domestic short, medium, or long hair, or you paid some serious bucks for it." Not always true, cuz I have a friend who got a pure bred Maine Coon from a shelter, and I've seen some Scottish Folds at my local shelter, but we haven't selectively bred cats like we have dogs. 




 I need to get a harness for my ginger boy, bwcause he loves being outside, even on a leash, but he bolts and his breakaway collar lets loose and I end up chasing him around the parking lot for 10 to 15 minutes, trying to keep him from running into the street. I'd love if they could be indoor/outdoor, but there's too many cars around my apartment for that. 




 It's sad that New Amsterdam tastes pretty good for my unrefined tastebuds. When I'm out and about, I won't order anything worse than Sapphire, but for a simple mixed drink while watching Star Trek, cheaper stuff is ok. 




 It's good for making vanilla extract..... That's about it. 




 Sounds awesome, besides the vodka (ugh again). The only way I can describe the tatse of vodka, even really good vodka, is "freshman year and regret." 




 I'm gonna finish the ham I made for Friendsgiving Sunday in the next day or so, so I think I'm gonna make some stock with that bone and the chicken carcass I have in my freezer, then make some split pea soup. I'm just hoping to finally break in the enameled cast iron Dutch oven I got for my birthday over a month ago. 




 Simple gin and cranberry for me. Since I'm still a poor colkege kid, it's New Amsterdam gin and Kroger brand cranberry juice, but it's better than nothing. 




 Always helps me. Maybe add a touch of honey, to help it stick to your throat. Whiskey+hot water+lemon juice+honey always helps my sore throats. 




 Buddha only had a male dog friend (Cody), but he only started squatting when he was 14 or so. Copying makes sense, though.

They both lasted for a long time, though. Cody was a cocker spaniel who wandered off one day a few months shy of his 18th birthday, and we put Buddha (a Newfie/Black Lab/German Shepherd mix) down when he was 15. 




 Glass blowing is awesome. I've seen a few demonstrations from the one at Indiana University Bloomington , and I know at one point all the scientific glassware at the University of Wisconsin at Madison was made by my grandfather. It's a skill I hope to gain at some point in my life. 




 And when my old boy dog was at the end of his days and arthritic enough, he squatted just like the bitches. 




 My first grade teacher told us that the reason Northern Indiana doesn't have as many hills as Southern Indiana because the iceberg that sunk the Titanic fell on the country and squished all the hills south. 




 Friendsgiving was amazing! I've still got some Dr. Pepper/sriracha ham left, but the curried butternut squash risotto and green beans with almonds didn't last 20 minutes. And per suggestion, I went with a spinach and arugula salad before everything else.

I didn't have time to bake my own bread or make dessert, but it was still appreciated.

EDIT: I did have to cut a few inches off the top of the ham because one of the cats started licking it while I wasn't looking. Assholes. 




 The more you know!

HuHot is good for what it is. Of course the badly translated stuff from the hole in the wall where they barely speak English is better. 




 This sounds a lot like the Hu Hot chain here in the states. Which is amazing, even though it's a chain. They have a bar where you fill a bowl with meat, veggies, and sauces, then they stir fry it all on a huge metal slab.

Nice to know the origins, because it was a huge deal when Hu Hot opened here in southern Indiana. 




 I always make a boatload of cookies (chocolate chip, sugar rolled in various colors of sugar, gingersnap, and these weirdly amazing salty oatmeal ones), fudge/truffles (mint chocolate and kahlua are the most popular), and fancy chocolate covered pretzel sticks (over the years there's been white and dark rolled in crushed candy canes, peanut butter and bittersweet, and so many others). 




 Here's why I only go on $3 Thursdays. Still $3 for a double at my usual, although it's $6 once my friends and I go to the club across the street. 




 So sweet. In other news, I have that same panini press/griddle. 




 And it ain't nowhere near big enough to be a malamute. Also, I'd think a dog indigenous to Guam wouldn't be that furry/kinda fluffy. 




 OH GOD, WHERE DO I GET THE SALTED LICORICE ONES?!?!? I guess my Scandinavian heritage is showing, because salted licorice is my second favorite type of candy (regular licorice being number one). 




 Never heard of it before, but I bet I do. 




 You've gotta wait a bit before consuming. Mix the pellets in with some of the melted stuff, and oh man. Makes me think back to when we had a kiosk in the mall at home. 




 I have sone undergrad friends who lived in Tulip Tree. Not sure if it was hard to get a spot, but it was an amazing 3 bedroom, 




 Where's the option for strawberry?!?

Edit: although I may just be weird, cuz pistachio is a close second for me.... 




 Love them all, but so so happy about your comment on Alloy. Reminds me of a terrible pale pink lipstick I vought once that can only be described as "baby prostitute color." 




 Haha, I love being able to hug her so easily, even though she protests. And I'm enough of a spaz when it comes to the health of the kitties that I call the vet pretty much the second I catch one of them puking, because they hardly ever do it. 




 I don't ever have bananas :-( 




 I learned the hard way to only cook chicken the second it's defrosted. I'm usually a skeptic when it come to exact guidlines, but eating chicken that has been frozen, then in the fridge for three days, is a terrible, terrible idea.

Also, as always, smell it. If it smells even the tiniest bit off, ditch it. It's better than spending three days on the toilet, switching which end your illness comes out of. 




 I'm hosting Friendsgiving on Sunday, the day before classes start up again. Several of my friends weren't able to go home for Thanksgiving (although they are getting a good dinner from another friend), and I hope to send them home with some leftovers, since I can afford it. So, I'm planning on something untraditional, since I get sick of turkey in a few days. Does this menu sound good?

Dr. Pepper glazed ham (had it last year and everyone seemed to like it)

Curried butternut squash risotto (another favorite from last year, and a decent vegetarian entree)

Roasted mixed veggies (I'm thinking turnips, beets, parsnips, and carrots)

Green beans with almonds

Brioche to go with it all (making brioche is awesome)

And pain au chocolat for dessert (making croissants is even more awesome). 




 I really like sauteed green beans with almonds. Butter and oil if it needs to be vegetarian, just oil if it needs to be vegan. 


Spicy glazed carrots are also good. I usually saute the carrots for a bit, then glaze with a brown sugar, sriracha, and water reduction.

These are both things I serve at my Friendsgiving, since I have a lot of vegetarian friends. 




 She'll be two in March, and only weighs 6 and a half pounds. The vet always comments on how petite she is. 









 I called those circular bales of hay "hay pigs," for a really long time. Kids are just silly. 




 I've only made then a couple times, but I'd agree that is too short. I put mine in the water before going to the store for wine, garlic, and bread, then rinsed them again. It was about 45 minutes. Super amazing, not sandy at all. 




 "Authentic full English breakfast poutine barbeque pizza paella" 




 Mine are technically Katrine and Guillaume (former French major). Kate because everyone I've ever met woth that name is super feisty (my dad only calls my mom that when she's being feisty, haha), and Bill because I hold the belief that all ginger cats should be named after Weasleys, haha.

I couldn't imagine fostering that many! Kate was a foster failure, I only got Bill because she needed a friend. 




 Haha, I posted a pic a while ago of my kitties lounging on my radiator. Now that it's turned full blast, they just do just what yours is doing, 




 Apparently I'm weird because I can't not give animals human names. I've got Kate and Bill. This little girl looks like a Sophie to me. 




 This, and water if you're shaping cookie dough into balls. 




 One of my best friennds hates peas for the same reason. I don't get it, but everyone has different tastes. I personally don't get how anyone can enjoy avocados, so you do you. 




 The dreaded three-day hangover struck me a couple weeks ago. Get yourself some oatmeal, that's my number one cure. 




 I think they migrate to those who are severely allergic first, though. 




 It's still a good idea to get a round of rabies shots after getting bitten, just in case.

My mom got bitten by one that got into the house earlier this year, and the doctor told her to go through with the shots. Sadly, even with insurance, it was $2400 for the whole thing, and it apparently hurt like hell (especially the one directly into the wound the day of, but getting several in a couple weeks would suck anyway). 




 Thank goodness I wasn't the only one who noticed. 




 Aww, I actually enjoy Enterprise. It is quite bad (the theme mskes the Firefly theme seem like a masterpiece, haha), but I still like it. 




 All of the Star Treks. The idea that there may one day be an Earth without poverty, without war, it's amazing. Voyager and Deep Space 9 are my favorites, but they are all wonderful. 




 I was one for two years in high school, and I always had the same early morning shift at the school. You get really attached to the people who come to your pool three times a week before work, and they get attached to you. They compliment you on your musical tastes, or tell you stories about "that time I saw Eric Clapton." They literally trust you with their lives, and they ask you about your swim meet that evening (a few of the guys who came in were either teachers or had children on the team). They ask how you're doing, and get excited when you tell them about your future.

It's been almost 4 years, but I still have a huge affection for "my old guys." 




 When I was little, the optometrist my family went to was named Dr. Ball, which was probably a terrible name. However, the clinic had a thing where they added the word "eye" before every doctor's name, so he was called Dr. Eyeball. It was pretty awesome when I was nine. 




 My eyesight isn't even that bad, but my optometrist is one of my favorite people. 




 "12 at night, love or fight/any way is right if you come out in night/its sp out of sight in Devil's Canyon."

Not quite as bad as I remembered, but no Leonard Cohen. 




 Free? My grandmother has been in this type of facility twice (2010 when she got her knee replaced and late last year when she broke her hip), and it was incredibly expensive. That facility works as both a nursing home and a rehabilitation center, and does get donations from the community, but staying there, even for a few weeks, can rack up a 5 figure bill. 




 IIRC, he wrote a song for them, but they rejected it. It's been a couple years since I re-read Helter Skelter, but my copy has a couple if his songs, and they're bad. Like, really really bad. 




 I sadly don't have any from that age, but here's a recent one! She's only 6 and a half pounds, and will be two in March. Tiny tiny.

 Being in the good side of your landlord is a good idea. I call the property management company about everything, so I only have to pay pet rent for one of my two kitties. Means I can't foster another, since I asked them before trying, but being on the gopd side of your landlord is really good, since they could make you homeless, if they wanted to. 




 Kinda makes me happy my landlord won't allow more than two pets. The two kitties make it hard enough to get thing done. 




 A calico and a goat? This picture is my dream. 




 This is exactly why I got cats instead of a dog (although I didn't intend on getting any pets until my former roommate decided to foster a kitten who stole my heart). Even a large single apartment isn't good to the type of dog I'd like, and class means I couldn't take a big Rottie or Newfie or Irish Wolfhound (my favorite) on as many long walks as he'd need. Once I move into a house with a big enough yard, I will get myself a nice big dog. 




 My tiny runt would disagree. She was only a tiny bit bigger than this at 12 weeks, when I met her. 




 Those look even higher quality than the ones I have. But they're lifesavers. 




 Also remember to allow for the fact that it will take longer to walk anywhere and that parking lots are always treacherous. I had to make a run to the Kroger on 2nd this morning before class, and nearly faceplanted several times in the parking lot alone.

I will also suggest going on Amazon and buying what can only be described as tire chains for your feet. I will look them up later, but they're $25, and are perfect for those of us who have to walk everywhere on the ice. Saved me from several bad falls last winter. 




 "And don't know how old it is" = proper sourdough starter. Jealous. 




 AirFrance has some pretty legit food, or at least it did in 2010. I mean, it's legit for economy class airplane food, but the French take food seriously enough that even the airplane food was decent. 




 O'Hare is just so legit. Only flown out of and into it once, but it was so much better than the Indy airport (which is actually really nice). SFO also has some really legit food, although $6 for a caprese sandwich is a bit much. 




 One of the only bad things I've found about the Indianapolis International Airport is that this is so not true. There's McD, shitty "mexican," and shitty "asian." Although, I've only ever flown out of it in the morning, maybe there are better things open past 9am. 




 Especially if you make the puff pastry from scratch, which is one of my favorite time intensive things to do. 




 I just brew some insanely strong coffee and use that to replace the water in ny recipe. 




 Not Thai, but there's a cajun restaurant I go to fairly often, and I always order the "spicy thai" etouffee, and they say that they are legally obligated to tell you how spicy it is. 




 First off, it's great that you're cooking for your family, and that you enjoy cooking.

Don't get too down because they don't express their feelings on the intricacies of your cooking. Some people can't pick them up, and some people don't even realize what the different flavor combinations are that make something taste good. I cook for my friends fairly often, and, while they say it's good, they don't say "oh, the nutmeg is what makes this curry really good," or "this is perfectly spiced." 




 This is me with Rally's. Dat fry lover's burger, tho. 




 Stoned. Fuck yeah. 




 I had a thing for dog treats when I was little. And I know a couple people who would eat wet cat food. So not too weird. 




 Upvote for music suggestion, although I would say that you should never ever ever skip Touch. Took a couple weeks, but that song def turned into my favorite of the album. 




 Ohmygod, ohmygod, mom, this box is so much fun! 




 Qit. Edit: 



 




 My parents got an electric cast iron one as a wedding present, and it still works wonderfully 30 years later. 




 I'm def gonna be trying this, cuz I personally dislike chickpeas. 




 I also suggest stocking up on sauces and spices you know you like. When I cook for friends, it's often just pasta+veggies+whatever genre of sauces and spices I'm feeling. Curry powder+nutmeg+red pepper flakes, hoisin+garlic powder+red pepper flakes/sriracha, or carbonara (noodles+bacon+egg+cheese) are some of my favorites. 




 Selling ramen at the liquor store? The only better idea I've even seen is the grilled cheese food truck that parks outside the bars every night. 




 Seconding the celeriac. My family used to always have a stock of cream of celeriac soup on deck until my dad found out he was allergic to celery.
