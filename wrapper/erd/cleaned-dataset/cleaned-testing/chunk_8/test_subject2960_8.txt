 I've been seeing a girl for the last few months who is absolutely amazing, and who's caught me off guard. We've been dating casually knowing that I'll be moving away to go to university on the other side of the country. We've only been seeing each other for two months, but I've really started to develop feelings for her that I didn't expect, and she feels the same way. Also her friends are great people who I'd really like to get to know better and I fit into their group very well (something that I often don't find easily)

I took a year off of university because I was dealing with depression and needed time to live at home and recollect myself before moving back to where I was going to university. Moving back to where I was going to school feels like it's the adult decision for me. It's me taking control of my life again and taking responsibility for myself. There are also a lot of great opportunities at the university that I'm going to that I wouldn't have if I stayed in the city I'm living in now (scholarships, professors that are invested in me, academic publishing, social contacts, etc.)

I planned on moving away before we started dating, but she and I really connect and I have some very serious affection for her. She's always known since the very start that there was a good chance I'd be moving away and that we'd only date for a few months. Also with the idea that we'd work hard to remain friends after I go back to university. 

There are some problems though if I stayed. First and foremost she's christian and I'm an agnostic, which is a problem for her. There would be problems in the long run because being in a long term relationship with someone who isn't religious could be a dealbreaker for her. Secondly, and related, she's a virgin and I am not, and because of her religious convictions I would feel bad about taking her virginity even she wanted to at the time. I've sexually escalated things with her (making out and being physical. both of which are new to her). Not being able to have sex with her would be a problem for me. That being said, knowing her, if we were to go forward with a long term committed relationship I think she'd be open to having sex. I wouldn't pressure her to go outside of what she's comfortable with, but sex is important for me in a relationship.

She's amazing, definitely very serious long-term girlfriend material. I'm really debating just dropping my plans and staying for her, because that's what I feel I want to do, but I know that in the long run going back to my university on my own gives me so much opportunity to succeed and grow. I really care about her and want to make sure she's okay when I go, and I'd be lying if I said part of me doesn't want to stay. 

What's your opinion, is it worth it to drop my plans to stay with a girl who I'm starting to have very serious feelings for? Or is it better that we go our separate ways, stay friends, and both look at our dating as a learning experience?

TL;DR: Unexpectedly developed a relationship with an amazing girl while taking a year off university, now that I'm going back I'm having some serious reservations about leaving. Should I consider dropping my plans to pursue a relationship, or is it better that I just let it go?


EDIT: I should just say that if I stayed in the city I'm currently living in that I'd continue my education here, it just wouldn't offer me the same opportunities that I might have if I move. 
 




 The mind's eye one is still broken, I just did it and scored a 4, when I've done similar tests with similar pictures and scored much higher.  




 I'm a writer and a musician. I used to write short stories and was working on a novella, but because of anxiety and depression I have a hard time creating new characters and imagining what they look like. I still write, but for that last year I've written only poetry, because I can create an emotion or a thought and don't have to create a person.  




 When my anxiety was at its worst I got into the habit of humming to myself when I thought no one was listening.  




 Yeah poetry has always been a fascination with mine. Lately I've been reading Rainer Maria Rilke, and I'd recommend him to anyone interested in poetry, especially on this subreddit.  




 I'm sure you know this, but most NT people don't usually follow those if there's no immediate reason to do so either. Most people don't follow arbitrary rules if there is no reason to. Lots of NT people would jaywalk if there were no cars coming (depending on the street of course) for instance. 




 The angst and sorrow are much too familiar for me. It might be an INFJ thing that we don't actually grow out of those feelings, but grow into and around them.  




 I have the same problem and am finding that writing every day yes helping me come up with and articulate thoughts better. 




 He seems like a good example of an unhealthy infj 




 I think Gandalf is the more INFJ of the two, but I'll certainly throw in my lot and say those characters have a lot of INFJ qualities. 




 Here's a quote from Andrei Tarkovsky's film Stalker, that I've always felt described music (and my feelings toward music) in a beautiful way. 


"Are you awake? You were talking recently about the meaning... of our... life... unselfishness of art... Let's take music... It's really least of all connected; to say the truth, if it is connected at all, then in an idealess way, mechanically, with an empty sound... Without... without associations... Nonetheless the music miraculously penetrates into the very soul! What is resonating in us in answer to the harmonized noise? And turns it for us into the source of great delight... And unites us, and shakes us? What is its purpose? And, above all, for whom? You will say: for nothing, and... and for nobody, just so. Unselfish. Though it's not so... perhaps... For everything, in the end, has its own meaning... Both the meaning and the cause..." 




 Yeah for MBTI I usually test an an INFJ but I've shown up as an INFP a few times. 




 More or less. I think the social functions of both are very different.  




 I've been getting a lot of comments in this thread assuming that I can't make general small talk. That's why I tried to preface what I was saying by mentioning that I'm fine with everyday conversation. I don't drag people into deeper conversations, and very rarely begin them because I know that I'm very analytical in them. Maybe I didn't write that clearly enough. I would never hijack someone else's conversation, and I know when it is and isn't appropriate to talk about certain things. I think you assume that I'm someone who forces intellectual conversation on others whenever I open my mouth, but that's not the case. 

As far as I can see, intellectual conversations are a level removed from everyday emotion based conversations. It's hard for me to see how an intellectual conversation could be separated from any hint of debate, even people with similar beliefs will disagree on some issues. I don't understand people who think they can lightly engage a topic like politics or philosophy.  




 That's where my problem is I can't see most intellectual conversation as regular conversation. Everyday chit chat is how you get to know people better, deep conversation is the trading of ideas. Chit chat is about participation, intellectually engaging conversation is about ideas.  




 Lately I feel like I'm starved of intellectual conversation. All day I participate in small talk, I talk about all kinds of things, I don't have too much of a problem, but I find deeper conversation much much more engaging. This is not to blow my own horn but to give context. I've always performed far above average academically, and have scored well into the gifted category on professionally administered IQ tests. 

The difference between my small talk and my intellectual conversation is night and day for me. I enjoy small talk. Talking about light interests, each other, places to go, things to eat, cracking jokes, I like it a lot; it's how you get to know someone better. On the other hand, deeper conversations on politics, morals, ethics, philosophy, literature, history, and science when I'm talking about the concepts and not just what's in the news is often another a whole other situation. I get very intense in these sort of conversations and I don't really know how to turn it off. It's not that I want to be right, but that when talking about these things I always want to dig deeper, and more often than not the other person or people don't want to. I feel like I do this because I almost never get to engage about these things in a meaningful way and when I do I try to keep the conversation alive for far too long. I don't have these conversations often outside of my family and very close friends, so it's not as though I'm badgering acquaintances with these conversations. I get over invested in intellectual conversation and it often makes me feel foolish when I try to keep a conversation about an intellectual topic going. 

What can I do to stop being too engaged in these sorts of conversations? 




 It's quite the odd thing to feel like an extrovert sometimes, even when you're not.  I know I prefer small conversation oriented groups,  and to be able to contrast that with how I can be at large gatherings is something a lot of people wouldn't guess about me. 




 It's definitely something that is a balancing act that I haven't totally figured out yet. I find that I especially try to adapt the sense of humor of a group, which can be difficult and awkward. 




 I'd recommend some Albert Camus, and Nietzsche. I know they are two very different philosophers, but Nietzsche gives a good explanation of why things are the way they are, and Camus' philosophy gives ideas on how to live with it. 




 I feel the exact same way. It's a confusing paradigm, and I'm still not too sure what to think of it. When I go to parties I often become the center of it, because it almost feels like I pick up on the "group feel" and adapt to it, but as soon as I'm away from the circumstance I go back to my own self. Sometimes I feel very out of touch with who I am. 




 Yea I have an intuitive (and sometimes annoying) ability to slip into the mannerisms of other people. I've been finding it very frustrating and a little distressing lately, because sometimes I feel that my own personality is "overwritten" by anyone else I interact with. It's something that I try to stay mindful of. 




 When I'm participating in a group I intuitively change my behaviour to fit in better with a group. The problem with this is I begin to lose my own identity inside of a group dynamic. I'll be honest that I have self-esteem issues, and that that is a certainly a big part of the problem. Every time I'm in a new group I subconsciously conform(sometimes unsuccessfully) to their behaviour instead of adding my own to the dynamic. 

How do I maintain my own identity and add it to groups instead of conforming to theirs? 




 Tonight I was out with my friend and their friends, we were laughing having a good time, and really we having great conversation. One of them pointed out that I fit into their group like I'd always been there. Anyway we had really long conversations about a lot of different things and I participated in all them very well and with no trouble, but I couldn't think of things to talk about myself.

 I seem to draw a complete blank when it comes to generating new conversation topics, or being able to change a conversation to a new topic. This is something I really need to get better at because I like talking to people, and am pretty good at it, but I just can't come up with new things to say, in fact I get a lot of anxiety trying to figure out something new to talk about. I can jump from someone else's last topic, but I can't start a conversation to save my life.  What can I do to get better at generating conversation topics and engaging people with them? I seem to do just fine in conversation outside of that, but I just can't seem to start my own topics.  




 Yeah definitely. I think the thing that I've been trying to do with "noun-ing" is going for things that dig a little deeper into their personality. It's a great way of finding conversation topics, and it's helped a lot with keeping conversations going. 




 I'm glad that my conversations are getting some flow to them. It was something that was really lacking, but it's getting better. I'm trying to work on getting a little more out of my comfort zone and "leading" conversations, but I've got lots of things I need to work on. Thanks 




 Today I went out for lunch with a friend, and the conversation went pretty well except that it went into some strange topics that left both of us wondering how we'd brought up that topic. We were at a restaurant and having a conversation about rats (not the most appropriate conversation to have where people are eating). We were talking about what kind of animals we'd seen or had lived around, she brought up mice, and then I told a story about the cat sized rats that lived near the harbor of a city I used to live in. It was a little weird and left us both asking how the conversation had gone in that direction. I

What're some good skills to work on when trying to change topics, or segue into something more interesting? 




 I just want to say that, for the most part, we're in the same boat. I've tested as being "gifted", I've had friends who are in art school tell me I should model, and I have many talents and interests (play three instruments, write, competitive sports, reading, cooking) and yet I have little faith in myself. It's been hard trying to gain confidence. I have a lot of reason to be confident, but it's almost as though I can't convince myself. 

I hope that you find out the trick to unlocking that confidence. Changing your own perceptions is one of the hardest things you can do but it's well worth it. Best of luck.  




 I quit games and started my self-improvement project. Whenever I don't know what I should be doing I either start reading (I've written a long reading list), go to the gym, or ask people if they want to do something. Setting goals for myself and identifying what I want really helped me to fill my time. 




 Thanks for the response, those are some good responses and I'll try to play up that sort of response in the future.  




 I think keeping a straight facial expression and not acknowledging the teasing would make you look like you can't take a joke. How could you seem dominant without looking like you have no sense of humor?
