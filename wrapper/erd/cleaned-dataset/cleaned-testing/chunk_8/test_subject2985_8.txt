 And you know that 100 years ago someone was crying "Think of the children! Nipples are sinful! Everyone will be lusting after them!" 




 This is what I posted on Facebook:

Tomorrow is the 15/15/15 Moneybomb for Bernie. Join this Thunderclap to maximize its impact.

 One of his most impressive stats is that he's received 400,000 donations from 250,000 different people, averaging $33. To give that some perspective, Obama (who defeated Hillary last time) had 180,000 donors by this point in the 2008 cycle, and Hillary has gotten donations from 50,000 people, but has raised 3 times as much money. She has the 1%, Bernie has us, the 99%.
 
 So join this Thunderclap and let's drive those numbers up even higher to show everyone that Bernie is the candidate FOR the people, BY the people!

Feel free to steal use any of it if you think it'll help. 




 Doesn't seem to be a problem for ATMs. 
















































































































































 Thank you.

Title:

Jesse Ventura: Bernie Sanders Has Got Momentum

Exact quote:

Hats off to Bernie Sanders. Ill help him anyway I can, although Im not quite as socialistic. Bernie believes in power to the people and the people controlling the government, and I believe in that also. 




 Look at his competition/peers. I'm not going to say that Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Scott Walker, etc. are as ridiculous as Trump, but they certainly play at his level.

 The two I'd recommend are The Wire and Boardwalk Empire. They're not Amazon Prime, not Netflix, though.

On Netflix I'd recommend House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, and Firefly.

  America has socialist aspects about it. It's not all bad.

Police and firemen are the ones that I often reference. When you dial 911, it's not a corporation coming to save you. 














 Awesome! Make sure he's set up to vote in your state's primary:

 What? 




 I'm sure he will. His campaign is only 2 months old, and he doesn't have billionaires and SuperPACs supporting him.   




 I was speaking about the country as a whole, not specifically in reference to Florida. I should have clarified, as both the article and the parent comment were about Florida.

My bad. 



















 I think many Sanders supporters have come to see the light by seeing just how aligned with Bernie their personal beliefs are, and these tests are a great way to show them that. I posted a link to [ISideWith.com](http://www.isidewith.com) on my Facebook wall today, and I think my friends were surprised to find out just how pro-Bernie they are.

Personally, I like ISideWith.com's test. I think it offers some really great resources and offers a very thorough set of answers across the political spectrum. But there are many out there, so post the one that you think is the best to the social media of your choice. 




 It never amazes me how the republicans are credited as being the party of Christianity, but almost everything that they stand for goes against the things that Jesus taught. He was incredibly liberal, yet "the religious right" has somehow claimed him.

 I actually think that if he wins the nomination, democratic turnout would skyrocket, which would be huge. The republicans are going to show up and vote for their guy, they always do (that's why the country is so much more liberal than the government, the left is underrepresented among actual voters). But if we give the left someone to get excited about, like Bernie, then I think they'll actually turn up and elect him.
