 That's different from what I mean. Calling out of work just because you don't feel like it. That kind of laziness is what I'm talking about here. Sitting in your car listening to music when you should be working, that's not being innovative. That's being lazy. Innovations are one thing, but if you're being lazy for the sake of being lazy, then that's what I'm talking about here. 




 I'm that guy that who tells stories "like an old man" as my wife points out all the time. I tell a story with every detail and it bothers her. Like a grandpa on tv when he's telling a war story but without falling asleep in the middle. 




 Quit being such a lazy asshole. Being lazy is the worst human trait ever. Work is good for you. I hate laziness. I want to call out every lazy person on their bull shit but if I did, then so many people I work with would dislike me to no end. 




 My dad always says the same thing. He grew up Catholic but didn't raise us the same. 




 The first time I saw marijuana up close. I smelled it and the smell was immediately familiar. Growing up, my family always visited my grandma who lived about 2 hours away. Her house always had a distinct smell and I wasn't sure what it was. When I smelled marijuana for the first time, it was as though I was back at grandma Tracy's house. Every time I'm ever close enough to marijuana, I can't help but take a big whiff. 




 Either of the following:
1. The smell of bleach on my hands no matter how hard I scrub
2. Stickiness
3. The sensation of wearing wet socks all the time
4. Standing in line for something I can't go on without
5. Driving in heavy traffic when I'm already late 




 This is perfect. I hate being sticky. Hate isn't strong enough of a word. 




 I see a lot of y'all want them to alter penis size and erection control. I would like to add my two cents to that idea. Twist the right one for penis length and the left one for girth. Push the right one in to activate penis erection and the left one to deactivate penis erection. Push them both in at the same time to immediately ejaculate. This last one would come in handy if you're experiencing that long fuck like Dave Chappelle's wrap it up box skit.

 Pizza Hut? I'm sure it is because their D.O.T. probably looks like a joke. Those clowns couldn't deliver a pizza on time if the food learned to deliver itself. 




 Came here to say this. Just the other day I bought a hundred dollar bottle of 18 year old single malt Glenlivet. Good stuff. 




 I gave my co-worker this same advice just a little while ago. 




 That's not worse than my brother in law piling "wasabi" sauce on his food thinking it was guacamole. 




 My mother in law convinced her daughter (20 years ago) that cantaloupe was alligator eggs. 




 The store I work at, if you order thin crust, we cut it into squares. Also, the artisan pizzas are cut into squares. Unless you mean a regular pizza that's shaped like a square. Then no. 




 I know a guy like that. His name also happens to be Matt. 




 He looks like he just woke up from a night of drinking. 




 What's the ratio of the pink sauce 




 Wait until there's about an hour left to my day and declare war on the rest of the planet (including allies). Then just go back to being me. 




 I'd walk in like "What up? I got a big cock!"
Sorry, had to be done...
I'm a terrible person. 




 I'll eat Vienna sausages but I refuse to eat that mushy canned meat that my wife claims is "the exact same thing but it's smashed up". Fuck that! No! I refuse! It smells like rotten cat food. Nope nope nope.  




 Which is why anytime I want the cheap taste of a fast food burger, I get the number five from McDonald's (double quarter pounder with cheese). No mayo by default. 




 I'm not the only one then. Tuna salad = Hell yeah! Hot tuna in any form = I'll starve to death first.  




 Same here 




 I've used numerous furnishings as masturbation assistants. Such items included two pillows tapped together, a mattress with a hole cut in it, and between two couch cushions (which didn't feel so good because they were those corduroy feeling couch cushions like this -- http://imgur.com/f2Sah8P which as soon as I realized my mistake I never used that couch again.
Also a micro-fleece blanket which I simply rubbed my junk on until I came. 




 I've done that... desperate times... 




 I might look like an idiot for this.


What's a "bae"? 




 Handmade pan pizza

Garlic parm sauce
Premium chicken

 Robert is his name. Bobby was what my siblings and I called him. Robert is what my mom called him. 




 Any and all of the lyrics from "The Fox" - Ylvis
It's like the Fisher Price toy that has the handle you pull and it tells you about different animal noises. 




 My parents needed me to stay with my uncle Robert and his boyfriend Lee at their apartment for a few days. The first night was fun, we all hung out in their room playing Nintendo 64, eating malted milk balls, and drinking soda. Then I had to go to bed. In a lonely dark room with a painting of some guy. This painting was weird to me and I couldn't sleep with it hanging right next to the bed. It was dark.

The door opened slightly letting some of the light in from the hall. Then a shadow blocked the light. It was dark.
My uncle walked into the room. He asked why I was still awake. I said the painting bothered me. It was dark. He confessed the painting bothered him too.      

Uncle Bobby sat beside me on the bed. He asked me if I would do something for him. It was dark.

I laid there quietly. He grabbed my hand and asked if I would keep a secret. I froze. It was dark.

He reached under the blanket. I felt his clammy hand get a light grip. As he gripped his target, he whispered "don't tell." He took the hand he held and moved it to himself and made me grip him as he whispered "up and down." It was dark. 




 I work for Dominos as a delivery expert and I'm addicted to two things. Delivering pizza and seeing the reactions on the customer's face when they realize how quick we got the food to them. "You guys are always so quick!" And/or "I was told 25 minutes and it's onlu been 18, wow!" It's so addictive.
I love my job. 




 A Klondike bar 




 Frozen pancakes baked to a crisp (not burnt) served with vanilla ice cream. Just because I was high when I first made it, doesn't mean it's a bad idea. 




 Shoes, mattresses, socks, underwear, tp, electronics, Oreos and stuff for your personal transportation (tires, brakes, fluids, battery etc).  




 Mississippi brings the Elvis sandwiches and catfish. (Prepared separately). 




 hitting the nail on the head - you did it right 




 Being the family computer know-it-all has its advantages. If I knew I'd be in trouble or I knew there was something I wanted to do, I would blacklist the MAC addresses of my parents' computers and devices. I'd "troubleshoot" for a short while and WHAM! No trouble accomplishing my goal. They would take it easy on the fussing and/or grounding or I'd usually end up going to that party or whatever. 




 Santa used the exact same two or three different wrapping papers as my parents. This seemed a bit suspicious.  




 I hate that too. My wife does that to me all the time. 




 This sounds like my kind of drinking buddies. Can't get that around here. 




 That sucks 




 A shovel. I used to dig holes in the back yard and got deep enough to drop down. Sometimes, I'd dig in a different direction once I got in and it'd be like a mining adventure and I'd find little stuff that was buried. One time I found a gold watch and someone's time capsule. There were old baseball cards, an old knife (Vietnam war era), and a small bag of "marbles" which turned out to be diamonds all in the time capsule. My dad sold the diamonds for about $500. We moved away from there and I stopped digging.  




 "Hey asshole, get the fuck out of the road!" 




 Until I was about twelve, I had an embarrassing lack of knowledge on how the powerball worked. I used to think one could write the numbers on the ticket themself. So my grand idea was "hey dad, why not just leave your powerball ticket blank until they say the winning numbers. You'd win!" I felt really stupid when I learned the numbers are pre-printed on the ticket.  




 I never did reach level 100 unless you count all the levels I've lost through PKers and lured higher level monsters (back when it was possible). Along with those lost levels, add in the various characters I've gotten to level 40+. With all that mentioned, I've probably reached level 200. Otherwise, I've never joined the level 100 club. I also stopped playing when it became harder to sell bps of runes. I used to have a steady customer base of over 50 players in Amera back then. I could generate 50k a day from rune creation. Now, pfft. 




 My wife enjoys "OviPets" or some shit. You only pay if you choose. In not sure on the details but if you remember neopets, that's what it reminded me of. 




 I've tried it in that sense too. Didn't care for it. I don't like how sweet it is. 




 You monster... how dare you.

On a similar topic. I seed to at least 2000.0 




 My problem with Pepsi is that they make mtn dew. That shit tastes horrible.  




 Not a throw away...


1. I like Nickelback
2. Don't care for cats
3. I don't care to use commas but when, I, do, it's at, inappropriate intervals.
4. That's all I have to say about that... for now

Edit:
5. I like Duck Dynasty 




 Those are simple for me. I have trouble with 12s.
* also 25 




 This. Exactly this. 




 I like to watch Duck Dynasty once in a while but I can't stand honey boo boo.
