 prolly more for world politics than world news. its only loosely based on an event.. the explosion, and more based on politics.


which is probably why the downvotes.

we might not have a choice with the rockets, but we can continue this discussion in a proper place 




 i dont care if it gives him the best orgasm ever, the government shouldnt kill its own people. We make mistakes and its cheaper and well a worse punishment to keep them in jail for life.
 




 i'll upvote if its about healing, and us coming back together and forgetting splits that happened before any of us were born.
 




 i bet you can find similar quotes from similar people at the same time slavery was ended. 




 every notice the difference between the staff at costco versus walmart? why do you think that is? think they like cherry pick the best of the lower levels of employment? or could it be that you get a better service because the employees care more because they can feed their family on the wages paid without having to get food stamps as well?

how does it go with you guys.... "you get what you paid for" and sir you just paid for some cheap ass service.
 




 well really, most people's complaints with CS, is when they try to leave.

well besides "Yeah, there is an outage in your area, we are working to fix it as soon as possible"

thats about it for cs.
 




 there used to be this store near me, called blockbuster... they had similar views.

its really kinda crazy, they had all the power and resources to kick ass, except the power to change.

its 2015 and the best they have given us is that crap hulu plus.

 




 dint [know this info, thanks](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/white-house-sides-with-oracle-tells-supreme-court-apis-are-copyrightable/) 




 Do consenting adults have a right to contract with other consenting adults? Supporters of the Supreme Courts decision argue yes but they argue no when it comes to economic liberties, like contracts regarding wages.

nope, even marriage has rules. Like multiple.. and divorces and ages and so on. I cant marry a child, like you cant hire one to work the mines, rand. Both have regs, yes marriage just lost one.. no gays. it still has a ton. Example fail.

I acknowledge the right to contract in all economic and personal spheres, but that doesnt mean there isnt a danger that a government that involves itself in every nook and cranny of our lives wont now enforce definitions that conflict with sincerely felt religious convictions of others.?

and when it effects others THEY SHOULD.

why does the right get this when it comes to muslims? and banning sharia law all over the south, like that was a pressing problem?

Some have argued that the Supreme Courts ruling will now involve the police power of the state in churches, church schools, church hospitals.

yeah cause teh rulling ordered preists to do gay marriages.

No one is saying shit to them, or shit to religious schools. HOSPITALS? YEAH FUCK OFF DUDE.. thats different. AND THE GOVERNMETN SHOULD TELL THE RELIGIOUS TO FUCK OFF.. its in the public sphere.. their schools and churches are not.

more fail from rand.

he also ignores his love of contracts doesnt work if they get invalidated at state lines.

but what ever.. keep digging rand, you never had a chance anyways, and you choose to step in a pile of shit, as you make dumb ass excuses about the free market thats just going to remind people your stepping into civil rights shit, when you claimed that the free market would have cured being bigots to blacks, without forcing businesses to actually serve them.. please ignore poverty makes it hard to "vote with your feet"

rand you just convinced me you are a bigger dumb ass than i ever gave you credit for and the only reasons you are speaking is you want to help protect the bigots. Considering the white supremecist support you and your father enjoyed, it might be just best if you shut teh fuck up and stick to tax cuts and deregulation, cause thats the only shit you really care about.
 




 ever have a divorce? 




 So walmart was set up.

Big fucking deal

and its the same BULLSHIT they did the last time with the anti gay cake.

The problem isnt the religious refusing to write gay and lesbian crap on cakes.. the problem was they refused to sell a cake at all. But the text on it.. that is  covered by freedom of speech and you cant make a cake maker write words they find offensive. BUT THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE CAKE.

so yeah a gay black man baker, has to make cakes for the klan/gop/w/e but they dont have to write the words on the cake.

this is more right winger retardation, just a rerun of the anti gay cake... they are allowed to do an isis cake and not a confedderate one, but both people have to get a cake.
 




 well part of the answer is there is no one republican party. its actually a coalition of conservative groups. There is the more economic conservatives and libertarian conservatives, who tend to yell the most to keep out of peoples lives. They are joined with the authoritarian and war like conservatives... How are more into spying and keeping the country safe and dont think people have the right to privacy and tend to like a lot of laws that put people in jail and are also joined with social conservatives, who do want government interference in social issues, like abortion and gay marriage and yoga pants and drugs and ...

there is no one republican party, so you are hearing the small gov chants of one section of the party, and the calls for  abortion laws from another section.

dems have similar coalitions, there is no one real dem party

they have to do this, rather than become multiple liberal and multiple conservative parties due to first past the post voting.
 




 this is my biggest problem with it. More than all the other crap people freak over.

it isnt national security.

Its a massive trade agreement.

Treaties are the highest law of the land akin to amendments.

the people have the right to know what our government is doing.

we are a republic, sure, cause the people can be idiots but mainly to protect minority rigths.. but also cause people would vote for services and vote against the taxes to pay for them and shit,. BUT  we have the right to be informed, and the right to lobby our reps on how they should vote and that if they dont vote our way, there could be consequences. It doesnt matter if we are actually in the wrong. 

and if we cna see some of the more crazy healthcare and budget ideas.. why the fuck cant we see this? that scares me more too.

like rand paul proposes flat tax.. thats insane, would explode the deficit, we would need massive cuts and would shift the burden to the lower classes...and now I know about it, i can tell my rep hell fucking no. or for the right, the proposals to legalize those brought here as children.. who have not commited any crime since.. yall have the rigth to say "hey vote fuckign no"

but with the tpp, they arent telling us shit. 




  ture but

1. news of the stupid doesnt require it be current.

2. it is becoming election season and as such this info is relevant to today.
 




 50-70 cents a day per phone.. without efforts.. can increase with a little effort. 




 Whats more, the updated terms of service would allow PayPal to contact users at either their designated phone number or even an undisclosed number PayPal managed to obtain through other means. 

wow.. a company gets a effective monopoly and cant leave well enough alone.


according to click throughs you can opt out but not easy

Those who dont want to be autodialed can contact PayPal support to opt out.

but also they say .. not everyone has been successful,.
 




 ER nope. 
 
how did he get so many upvotes? do people not read? Yeah thats part of it.. fucking read the rest in paypals own words.

(v) poll your opinions through surveys or questionnaires, (vii) contact you with offers and promotions; or (viii) as otherwise necessary to service your account or enforce this User Agreement, our policies, applicable law, or any other agreement we may have with you.


unless you want to claim a poll is a security measure.. you are actually doing exactly what you are bitching about, but from the opposite spectrum.
 




 Those who dont want to be autodialed can contact PayPal support to opt out.

no one said they were going to make it easy. Kinda shitty in my book. 




 probably just protesting the entire week. 




 what gets me, these people would like a dont_burn_the_us_flag in protest amendment, but then fly the flag of  the enemy of the union in protest every time they get.

Idk to me a little flag burning it a little less patriotically offensive, than actually flying the banner of the enemy. idk call me crazy. but one seems more like a complaint and the other seems more like a threat.
 




 damn you science and your limits. 




 yeah us cows in merica say moo, them french ones say meuh, finish amuuuuu, germans mmuuuhh, japanese mao mao.

 his investments in carbon also dont have an effect on its use. Demand and government regulation does. and the "you could do more" game is always a loser.

but everyone on the planet could sell every oil related stock they have and it wouldnt effect our use of gas. Investing in the energy sector isnt the same as venture capital into a new project. Losing investments would never kill big oil, they already make a little of their own money. 




 true.

But i do rank people like that in my mind.

People who believed in it before the ruling people who accept it after the ruling the people still fighting and crying about it.

pandering is better than digging in your heals. i'm a dem but i will say this comment is better than some of the others i have heard from the right on this issue.
 




 yep, heard it for years and thats about as much as you get. "he seems like it". But i would add, its more than not been married, he hasnt been known to really date either. i'm not trying to tilt the favor towards "he's gay".. but obviously if he had a different lady on his shoulder every week the "not married" wouldnt suggest gay in some peoples minds.

I couldnt care much less if he is or isnt. If he is and wants to come out, i hope he can some day. but i dont really consider him being fancy or single, means hes gay.. 




 What Googles doing, in these cases, is using its deep pockets in the interest of broader social ends, with seemingly little concern for short-term returns.

maybe short term, but lets not forget what google is, its an advertising and media company. Having a better infrastructure for silly cat videos is good for google. more and more people substitute youtube for tv. They might have good social intentions as well, but this sentence makes it sound like they are being selfless, and thats not true. 




 I think you mean as far as the line speed goes. FIOS and all and your mostly correct about that. but patent issues do always slow everything down a little.. but wasnt a huge deal with fios. but even if your idea is unique you got to do patent searches. But its been minor in bandwidth, and bringing high speeds to the people.

but the rest.. nah patents have been a big thorn in technology. There was a massive battle to build up patent portfolios when all the lawsuits started to happen. the big fears for small time developers is that they dont have the same access to a massive patent nuke of their own to protect them from lawsuits. Its definitely an issue. Slightly less today as some patent trolls were shut down by some various rulings, but yeah they were fucking up shit for a while

and then their are other countries fucking shit up.. like the iphone5 was patented by a clone maker in china before apple patented it...costing them a ton of money they might rather spend on research.


 




 well thats why governments tend to be the pioneers into the high risk unknowns and commercial interests come in afterwards and bring it to the people.  Gov explores, maps the wilds, puts up roads and commercial interests build the homes and businesses around it.

same with net, and space. unfortunately with net, they decided to stop branching out.. and luckily google though help with the government, stepped into some markets to inject competition.(sigh living near a google city, just an hour drive north they get 5 times my speed for the same price i pay)
 




 yeah its a bit odd given the context. She might have bigger identity fears though.. however the problem isnt women covering up, its the lack of choice. If she wants to wear her face thing, thats a triumph of freedom as long as she can take it off if she wants as well.
 




 not that hard actually but reddit might complain.

there are 'reddit clones" and i mean of the data.. sorta. I believe they just use the reddit api.. i used to have a rainlender desktop where i pulled in all the posts from my fav subreddits to be my desktop backgound. they were clickable and all that. could either go to the link or the comments.

but the point is, they could pull in through the feed the reddit posts.. though reddit probably would have a legit complaint over that, especially using their own software to do it. but voat could pull in just the posts and leave separate an area for us to comment.

and here are a couple reddit feed pages. and yeah i know not the same as cloning reddit. but the point is there are ideas they could possibly work on though legality might be issues.

[redditjs](https://redditjs.com/) (this one just kinda mods the interface, click grid and crap on top.. its cool)

and [aggreddit](http://aggreddit.com/?r=reddit.com+pics+politics+WTF+funny+programming+science+technology) (this one you set up the reddits with the link. like this one http://aggreddit.com/?r=reddit.com+pics+politics+WTF+funny+programming+science+technology)

and [redddit in real time](http://erqqvg.com/)

there are a few others.
 




 a small suggestion, since you seem passionately involved. I am going to assume for not, that you have a better idea of the contents of the TPP than say the generally public, since its been mostly kept a secret. And yeah there have been leaks and such. But you might want to pretend that people dont know anything at about it, each and every time you complain about being deleted or banned.

Like 

I hope they're not in college yet, because the TPP will cripple students.

wow sounds scary.. how is a trade agreement going to do that? honest. I dont know. I heard some on the copyright and some on the laws, i question, but most people i know dont know a damn thing.

These days, i hear more about the battle between yall and /r/polices and /r/news than i do the actual contents of the agreement. And thats not really good for your movement.

and yeah i know those are the places you would like to educate people and so part of that is hampering you on getting out your message... which is why you should be detailed in your complaints about deletes. Some of us dont know enough about it.

right now i am against it from what i heard, but yall go off on a lot of stuff, thats just not common knowledge yet and yall should work at making it so.

for me my biggest problem with the thing is being kept in the dark, this isnt war, this isnt national security, this is a trade agreement we have the right to know and lobby our reps to do what we think is right, even if it isnt. Even if our country loses power.. if we decide as a country we dont want to go in that direction, we shouldnt.(and unfortunately, i actually accept that on ideas that i would like to see passed.. its the american way, good or bad) 




 not only that, its a horse shit claim.

I can easily show how after connecticut closed the gun show loophole and put some restrictions on guns, saw a drop in murders by 40% over a ten year period. Now some of that is with the decline in murders us wide, but theirs was a bigger drop.

i can also show were missouri recently to show how anti left they were, got rid of some background checks and saw a 23% increase in murders.

most liberals.. just want to see the gun show loopholes which makes it totally easy for criminals to by pass background checks and get guns to get closed to make the law we put on the books back when reagan was shot, to actuallty be effective. Increasing background checks it not "letting only the criminals get guns". If you arent a criminal you can pass a  background check.

(and before someone says anything private sale loophole what ever you want to call it, but dont insult anyones intelligence by saying it dont exist.)

only a tiny minority of liberals want to go the english route of no guns.

What he is doing is as wrong as claiming all republicans think womens bodies shut down in rape so any women who get pregnant while being raped must have wanted it.

obviously only a small subset of extremist republicans feel that way.

well its the same but on the left with "gonna ban all guns"

 




 Its not really deceptive as long as you know they are measuring it by the country.

it is odd since the title of the link, is a bit deceptive to the 'left" of agw science... while the graphics sorta can appear deceptive towards the right. since it looks like "hey agw is no big deal here and fuck africa".. I get that. But its more about resolution. Posted without the text explaining that, then yeah.. its very deceptive, but otherwise its a difference of resolution.

I have to assume due to the title choosen for the article, that they were not trying to be deceptively denialist. Otherwise it would be "agw is not as big of a deal as you think.. look what countries will do ok"


and probably the most important line from the entire article.

 In other words, the best-ranked countries are only as great as they seem compared against the countries that arent performing so well.

its going to fuck us bad.. in costs.. for sure.. evacuate miami? lol easier to type but we are a wealthy nation and will do better, as far as direct climate effects than others. There is other worries about how the world will react  as climate change gets worse and we might have more to worry about from the war/terrorism front... then some countries
 




 /r/tronscript  might be some help 




 I think aol spent more on advertising than anything else. you could hardly get out of your driveway due to all the discarded discs.
 




 op here.. thanks.. post removed. 




 eh at least its posted here and not somewhere serious.

interesting read and some of it is probably true. but on issues like this, its a huge warning sign for you to use the views of a single person from that group.... and one that has been transplanted out of the area for a good bit of theri lives.


not saying they are wrong, but there has been a few black people who think taking down the confederate flag was wrong and harmed black people, by being petty over heritage and reinforcing the angry black man... not my thoughts in the least, but you can easily see and article "black man says keep the flag up, black people dont care'

and well you are missing the story.

OK back to the claim


Reading the click throughs are better at understanding this claim, then the article link, and i can see the concept as possible. However

if i say jews control all the money.. like some bigots like to do.. its still anti semetic, even if i wouldnt mind if it was me to control all teh money. So just cause i aspire to become that which i condemn, doesnt make it not bigotry always.

and last.. you do know its kinda bigoted to say all south koreas wishes they were money grubbing and careless about others? Even if you find one that pines to be attacked on those ideas. and you cant debunk a scientific conclusion with "i feel this is so" the scientific conclusion which COULD BE WRONG. that sk is bigoted because of the view they have.. to debunk this you got to show that SKn also hold the views that eventually they want to have these traits as well.. which means another study and not.. i met this dude who was like this and so all south koreans are like this.





 




 it is, but in america it is nearly impossible to have any civilized debate on the prison issue because one side refuses to and justifies everything by "that dude was evil".. doesnt matter if there is a better more effective way.. doesnt matter what science says.

shit look at all the people pissed the fuck off about how much it costs to keep someone in jail for life, 

A. ignoring it costs more to kill them.

and big for me.

B. these same people dont trust the government to do a god damn thing right, but when it kills its own people they are holy perfect.

so good luck talking about the conditions of solitary or how other countries do it.. or how our crime isnt worse than say frances, and yet per capita we put about 10 times as many people in jail.

we have a problem in this society and just trying to do smart things with the laws will get you labeled as a murder defender, or callous or w.e.. fuck even defence attorneys get attacked just for doing their job.
 




  On the other hand he has every incentive to sell prison employees out just to be a dick.

nope the exact opposite dude.

he has every incentive on the planet to not say shit.

how are you going to get more help to escape in the future.. if you rat out the guards?

nah.. he wouldnt say shit.


 




 well now I am confused.

You can keep wifi on the router for people with wifi.. and just disable it on the computer.

family can still use it.

unless you are trying to use your computer as a router? and want people to connect to your computer via wifi and go through your computer and out its ethernet? that can be done, but easier to just disable wifi on the computer and leave wifi on the router for family.


When I turn it off, the computer uses ethernet, but when it's on, wifi is used.

at least we know it isnt hardware.
 




 holycrap.. and this is the dailymail?

Just how the title.. not surprised they reported it but normally the title wouldnt have been so ..non attacking.

 




 running an iphone5 24/7 for an entire year is 41 cents. less than 4 cents a month. If your phone is crappier than an iphone5.. this number will most likely be lower.

ipads are less than $2 for 24/7 .. full year.


now laptops and tablets can get a bit more, seeing about $8 a year.. depending on models.

netbooks are going to tend to use less.

[for most of us, elect shouldnt even be a thought.](http://blog.opower.com/2012/09/how-much-does-it-cost-to-charge-an-iphone-5-a-thought-provokingly-modest-0-41year/)

i mean if your making less than 8 dollars a year in beer money.. 9in order for a laptop to be profitable) you might try something else.


 




 you really have all the info you need at hand, you are just asking for someone to tell you what to do. Its up to you man.

basically your going to hear two things.. i hacked and made a more money and didnt get caught.. versus i hacked and got banned, losing all ability to earn this easy beer money.

its classic risk reward... with unfortunately a random unknown.. you getting caught.

so is it worth it to you, the extra money you get per month 'hacking'. knowing you can get ip banned and lose the ability to work with perk, to keep doing it.

basically and this is a bit over the top.. but its the same idea, basically you are saying "i rob stores for extra money, i read in the paper that people get busted for this shit.. should i still rob stores" ok punishments are worse and rewards are greater... but its the same idea.
 




 like all others.

you get a link.

give link to friend.

friend clicks on link

friend signs up for perk

when friend redeems first reward..(read.. ACTUALLY uses the service.. they have to do this because its easy to automate sign ups.. and they want real people with real phones, actually perking)

you get your points.
 




 well you remember them pranksters? that tend to go to massive global business forums?

who made the proposal of letting the poor eat shit.. basically they claimed to have come up with a method of extracting nutrients from shit and turning it into hamburgers we could sell to the worlds poor.

the [yes men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP_nNemsNT8) 




 so by priority you mean the metrics?

hmm.. if you did metrics should have worked.

You can always disable the wifi adaptor in device manger or in the  change adaptor settings(probably best here)

if that kills your net.. and a reboot dont clear it up.. you probably have a problem with the ethernet.. since you bought a new router, i would check the cables first.
 




 why? its a good question? it helps further show how their true ideology is hate and bigotry and has shit to do with religion.  No i am sure they THINK they are religious, but basically they warped religion into a perfectly fitting body wrap around themselves. Thats not religion, thats clinically insane narcissism. They are basically saying they are the perfect example of what god wants to see in a human being, even if the bible says shit about the crap they do. because that doesnt count, the only things in the bible that count are shit other people do that he doesnt like.


it doesnt matter all the rest, any of it. lying stealing, killing, working on sundays, multiple marriages.. none of it for themselves, but for other people...

they are cherry picking bigots who want to shove theri own personal version of their religion down our throats while ignoring all the crap theri bible says about shit they do that they ignore. and the biggest is probably bearing false witness.

And last tell me this, if they are so fucking pious, so fucking religious the get pissed when someone doesnt say marry christmas. So fucking religious we got to tip toe arround offended them like they have some crazy person....why the fuck dont they threaten to set themselves on fire because the state lets people work on sundays in non emergency jobs? that shit was written in stone, i would think their god would think it was important.

nah they are bigots and liars.. and trump is helping people see that. 




 I get what you are saying the 10th.. right? The problem with that idea, is that constitution, is the constitution has a lot of other crap in it. Like how to AMEND the constitution and who gets finally say on what is constitution.(which you can override with an amendment)

Now.. this amendment process, honors the people like you who since the beginning of this country have screamed states rights. ITs actually honors the 10th amendment. Why? because amendments have to be ratified by 3/4ths of the states  level legislators AS well as pass the federal senate and house..

So the states, Under the protection of the 10th amendment agreed to the equal protection clause in the 14th amendment. This is where the fed doesnt get any powers not delegated to it. WEll the states gave the fed the power over "equal protection". The supreme court who decides what they meant, says its their jurisdiction and its their power to actually decide if its their jurisdiction via the constitution.

your tenth amendment rights were protected under both rulings. You have the right to over rule EITHER.. EITHER.. we can make black people slaves again.. NO SHIT.(well besides black people might not like that idea much) but it would take an amendment to the constitution. and 3/4th of the states to give the power back to the states. Now it is actually possible for scotus to find a new amendment unconstitutional but that is an untested legal theory as to what would actually happen in that case.


but yeah, just make an amendment saying states have the sole power to define marriage, and get 3/4s of the countries statehouse to agree.

 




 well they werent wholly wrong, he did say some very questionable things at the start, that made it seem like he was going to rule very much in the telecoms favor. 

I was only pointing out the flip.
 




 Sorry the title misrepresents the study a bit too much.

1/3 of the largest reservoirs are being used faster than they can recover. they are over stressed.

that is not the same as 1/3 being depleted as in gone.
 




 maybe.. especially in states that already legalized. the i got mine, dont give a shit about you and probably cry states rights.. yeah my state did it.. move here if you dont like yours.

and ... well there are probably some gays that like the excuse that its illegal in that it keeps their relationship open. Ok thats a bit petty but there are heteros that dont want to get married but are under constant pressure to do so.. see canadian storage wars.  WEll i bet she(the girl who keeps saying no on csw) might like the easier excuse,"i would marry you but its illegal" Its a bit more than petty to say its a bad decision because you have cold feet.. but its plausible. Some republican gay who has been using it as an excuse to his partner for ages, now has none. 




 he votes how alito votes. 




 1 of them joined the left. so  one is kinda mainstream.
it was 5  to 4 with all the left joining kennedy.
 




 i wasnt talking religion, just people who kill themselves to protest something. [And that most are a form of protest against a powerful oppressive government](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/a-terrible-act-of-reason-when-did-self-immolation-become-the-paramount-form-of-protest)

and while more prevalent in the east, the west, has seen a ton as well. but christians did it in rome, and russia, and various christians have done it but not for christian causes and at least one to protest war in the us.
 




 and thats good.. fast track isnt inherently  bad.. some of the rules they added to it is bad. Fast track is the way it actually has always been. 

You should not be able to amend the treaty and send it back.

you should be able to make recommendations and demands that the president secure, before negotiations. But you give treaties up or down votes. Thats because there are too many legislators involved in too many countries. WE would never have gotten any multi country treaty passed without fast track.

it simply says no amendments and the treaty gets a vote on the floor.

the secrecy and contents suck balls, but fast tracks the way its got to be.. in all big treaties.. maybe between two . or three countries.. but even then we are talking 2000 reps each with political goals and agendas.. much bigger than that, its wholly impossible.


edit; ok we can debate a bit on the "this treaty gets a vote" because it removes the ability to filibuster, which to me isnt as bad as adding amendments and can be killed with enough votes. But the rest of fast track is a good thing. (and yeah filibusters have been more than abused just to pass minor things, but something like this, i say filibuster is fair game)

 




 remember when reddit wanted to tar and feather wheeler? pepperidge farm remembers.
 




 actually this is typical.

the haters who scream they will do this never do.. its the ones who have a powerful feeling of sacrifice for others, in the face of some oppressing force... like tibet, china

haters tend not to. And you can kinda see why, their lives tend to be governed by fear.
 




 "true conservative"?

sorry but i disagree, you can have conservative religious. and you can have conservative authoritarians.

your brand of true conservative, which sounds pretty libertarian preaches less government intrusion.

unfortunately your brand of conservatism, is only a small part of the republican party which represents you.

Not attacking, same with progressives, we can have authoritarian progressives, and religious progressives, and non religious progressives. states rights progressives. but unfortunately for us, while we tend to have more social conservative progressives, we dont have as many economic and legislative progressives as many of us would like.

i am surprised there isnt more infighting in the gop because their coalition has so many opposite views.

but basically the gop is economic conservatives, mixed with authoritarian and religious conservatives.

 




 allah is the arabic word for god. Or "THE GOD OF ABRAHAM".. yeah that abraham.. same dude.

they are both abrahamic religions. Allah = yahweh = god

Same god, different language. Period.

Now muslisms came after christians and much like mormons today, they tend to not see them as following the same faith. but islam is just judaism and the torah + christianity and the bible + the quran and muhammad.

much like mormons are judaism + christianity, + the book of mormon and joe smith.

they are just additions to the existing religion. Same god, all 3.

now as a matter of faith, you can claim its a bastardization of the abrahamic religion.. but like it or not, they claim to worship the exact same dude.




 




 all religions are.

and sorry if you think the muslims are the only ones acting bat shit crazying and killing non believers you havetn been to christian africa, it just doesnt make the news as much for us, because it isnt very strategic.

the muslims were actually very enlightened when the christians pushed us in the dark ages. They lead the word for intellectual advancement and protected a lot of knowledge from destruction. They had a resurgence of right wing, lets go back to the past, science is afront to god, type folks, that put islam into its own sort of dark ages, part of that was helped by the west when we went down to the middle east and fucked the place all up which helped the more militant right winger muslims to rise a few dozen times in history, but part of it was islam itself. But it is no different that christianity as far as "outdatedness".. and there are many muslim nations that are quite progressive, especially in asia. you are just looking at the right winger version when you see the violence and offense and religious control over every day life.. much like our right would like to do in the us.
 




 2 people attacked by shark off the coast of SC.

right? left? inbetween?

There can be non political news, but I do agree that most is.
 




 nope.. it suggests that it does IN FACT reduce how much insurance companies have to pay out for claims.

its not the same as what you are suggesting which they do do for other things... let me put it this way.

jenny the drinker slips on wet floor, hurts back, sues for workmans comp, passes drug test gets 50k

tommy stoner, slips at the exact same time, on the exact same floor, but get drug tested. The insurance companies will claim it was the drugs that influenced his fall so they dont have to pay him 50k

it has nothing to do with drug tests working.

it has to do with using drug tests to get out of paying.

if you want to say they work at saving insurance companies and the businesses that hirer them, money, then yeah.. they work for that, but they are sold for productivity reasons.
 




 well thats generally what happens when you make less work injury claims.
 




 well I will if he only uses blogs and youtubes to make his case.

I don't share your faith in government and large institutions.

big business kinda disagrees, its government who are the pioneers, after they access the situation, the commercial markets move in. See commercial markets dont like entering areas where the risk is highly unpredictable, the government is less hampered and as such, thats why they were the first in near earth orbit, but now its time for the commercial enterprises to take advantage of the info the government provided so they can successfully fulfill market needs. (and yeah i saw the neil degrasse talk) 




  We don't have a realistic method to produce that much bacteria

i think the point is it would feed and breed on mars.. bacteria dont really need us to produce a ton, it would just take a lot longer for the colonies to grow.

but i suspect we would send relatively little.. and yeah maybe someone can debunk this idea and say "yeah but it would tkae 2 million years to reach critical levels" idk.. but i know that shit breeds fast.
 




 NZ finds Black Cocks hard to swallow

lol media.

Not quite the same but in south carolina with the gamecocks.. everything is cocks. girls all wear pants with cocks on the butt.

our horse cocks won the equestrian national championships.

our lady cocks kicked ass in basketball.

heck even our disc cocks  kicked some butt this year tossin the frisbees.

three wet cocks are going to the national diving competition.

running cocks, sandy cocks.. and so on... we are a bit childish but idc.

edit: my bad the volleyball team is the sandy cocks.. fixed 




 interesting, i had always heard prescott bush was part of that.
came from the bbc. Now i dont see any credible links.. just ones on sites like prison planet.. its still claimed in a single bbc radio program and can find it no where else.. cant even seem to find their sources.

anyone have any credible info, before i file this under my 'unproven conspiracy, dont use' box in my mind? 




 nope. We do get you have a hate for the man, so your view is horribly colored.

Let me hazard an easy guess, but i suspect you dont happen to be an obama supporter? that you probably agree more with the right of the aisle? is this a fair assessment? not saying you are a republican, just not left? and let me guess fdr mae the depression worse?
 




 it wouldnt matter if it was when he sucked hitlers dick.

the comment is about a president giving an eloquent fuck you to his detractors. the guy posting it doesnt even say he is a supporter. 

it doesnt have to do with politics as much as kick ass fuck you'n

and yeah a lot of the left was fucked up and bigoted as fuck before the civil rights era.. tell me do we have to discount all of history and say absolutely and none of it was good until say after the  race riots of the 60s? fuck back then republicans were the anti bigots.. now the head of the republican party in the house(not the speaker but the lead of the party) was a speaker at a white supremacist group which he claims was a different meeting held at the same time and place with the same people but on different subjects.

anyways lets get back to beautiful fuck yous.

like i said the GOP used to be the anti bigots.. maybe you can find a famous GOPr like lincoln or something telling the bigots off eloquently. I'll upvote that shit. Or fuck, idk, it could be bush jr, who i hate, if you find a good speech, and i agree it was a good fuck you.. Up votes are heading your way 




 and they never stopped hating him 




 more [info for those who want to know what he is talking about](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/joe-biden-gay-marriage-white-house-response-105744.html)

Vice President Joe Biden really did get ahead of President Barack Obama on accepting gay marriage in 2012  and the White House really wasnt happy about it, despite the two leaders many attempts to claim otherwise.
..

Thats the story laid out in Jo Beckers new book, Forcing the Spring, which documents the past few years of successful efforts to expand the legalization of gay marriage, according to an advance copy obtained by POLITICO.

biden might still get some credit historically. Obama def will get the most as he was president, but the gay community will probably learn of and know of bidens contributions in future studies.

 




 yeah, in my area it bugs me a bit, due to recession we cut back.. no more mosquito spraying.. but we sure as fuck put up christmas decorations every year.. and yeah we own them and probably dont have to replace too much but it takes a fuck ton of workers to put that shit up all over town and take down.
 




 i'm sure teh gov has some gels for various reasons, including entertainment. you will find them on military bases in the clubs and such. he might have gotten his own, but its not like the gov doesnt have them. 




 some  dude in bathrobe with a beard loves trucks... its hilarious how much reverence they give to an impossible image. Even if you think his skin wasnt that dark, his facial  features  as displayed are decidedly from north of those parts from which he was said to reside.
 




 It also doesnt matter that much.

there are rich people that lobby for higher taxes and yet still pay the rate it is today.

you can complain about the communication laws, trying to oppen the system up more, while being part of it.. like tmobile did some with tower sharing


you can claim walmart is killing the place without doubling your employees pay and trying to compete with your much smaller buying power.

its not necessarily hypocritical.. and yeah it is a bit different if it is a advocacy group but like people mentioned, it goes up to 15 quickly.

and you can be a smoker and advocate stricker laws, the big hypocrisy happens when you dont let people know you are a smoker as well and instead get caught
 




 is ti wrong? or cruel? I mean if you get the woman to stop destroying the thing further.. is that a bad thing? in court they are going to list the cost of repair. I dont think she would have listened if he said.. hey stop doing that. but she might listen if he said something stupid.
 




 yeah i dont doubt the idea between federal power and states rights has been a long fought over idea. But really with anyone saying that, point them to the confederate constitution. It gives itself supremecy over the confederate states. STRONG FED... that lost only the power to ban slavery.

They actually edited the lines above and below the supremacy clause in the us constitution but left the actual supremacy clause in theirs.

how can it be about states rights, when their own constitution set up the exact same fed as the US constitution, sans the right to ban slavery.

and here is the thing..  [banning slavery didnt start the war. Banning expanding slavery into the new territories into the west did.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) No one told the south they couldnt have slaves.. but that the slave trade couldnt expand out west. 

even when lincoln did his [emancipation proclamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation) which was after the war had started. ALL it actually did ws change the federal legal status of slaves. SO that if a slave escaped a slave holder state, he would not be forced by the courts to be returned as property. and due to quirks in presidential rights during war time... he could only apply the proclamation to states in active rebellion.. so only a few were actually freed by lincolns actions.. the rest were freed near the end of the war with an actual amendment process which you cant compain federal power, since it requires 3/4ths of the state houses to agree

 it did not apply to those in the four slave states that were not in rebellion (Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, and Missouri
 




 You know, I could respect her praise if she admitted she made a mistake and has grown on the subject like many other American.

so you dont think she is doing better than the GOP in the fact that she isnt trying to make an amendment overturning the ruling.

No where did i claim she meant it.. just that she accepts it.

You can at least grasp that right? The GOP are continuing the war, she put down the pitchfork. She can still believe what she believes, but sorry I WILL SAY IT IS A GOOD THING, when someone puts down teh pitch fork.. even for bullshit.. non real reasons. The fact is she is no longer dressed in the enemies uniform shooting at us. Why she isnt I dont give a fuck.. the fact she isnt is good.

But i do appreciate your response. Unlike the rest.

I am no fucking hilary fan.. i wonder about the clinton bush reagan connections especially when it comes to the CIA and drugs.. You do know the cia planes that did the iran contra drug smuggling used arkansas airports while bill was gov..


**But i am going to say, I am 10000000% correct, that someone not attacking us is better than someone attacking us. And I dare anyone to prove me wrong.**
 




 yeah ISIS is a bastion of gay rights.. that should have given someone a clue.. that maybe.. just maybe, they might need to look closer.

Like if you saw a black rights march, will 90% black people and suddenly some come by, carrying a confederate flag.. it might give pause, but if you see no one in the march.. upset in the least.. well you might need to look closer at that flag.

PS occupy wallstreet loves to fly the 'corporate america" flag for similar reasons. A quick view might seem 'hey they are celebrating america. when a closer view says 'no they are, upset at how corporatist america has become.

much like the dildo isis flag and they made it because isis says the same shit you hear american republican say on a daily basis when it comes to gays.
 




 not really sure where to post politics r/politics doesnt approve of.

and like it or not this does have to do with politics.
 









 i dont doubt really.. its not really a complex symbol..i'm sure it has been accidentally drawn in the past by people just making random shapes. 




 yeah thats part of my point. This is being spammed everywhere because the GOP think they can make points by pointing out that she was against gay marriage just like them.

but she changed .. at least her rhetoric, they did not.


i know her stance, my point of being vague was to apply it to all people left or right who you can find with a video denouncing gay marriage back in the past. How they felt in the past is less important than if they accept it now.

hey in my state, many of the politicians who now support bringing the flag down, supported the flag. Call me crazy, but I am going to give them a little praise, even though they are opposite ideology, for growing with the times, and condemn louder the people who dont.

You just cant expect a huge societal change like this and just condemn everyone who was ever against it til the end of time, even if they accept it now.

more downvotes and no debate, I see my detractors have no abilities to defend themselves 




 Clinton charity took up to $10 MILLION donation from African church which called homosexuals 'devils' - despite Hillary's support for gay marriage

her charity accepted money from an anti gay church. a charity she set up but doesnt run and so what? should charities do a background check on everyone who ever donates and give back any money that comes from questionable sources?

do you think a black family wouldnt appreciate food at a food bank given by the klan? and how does that say "we support this group" by taking their charitable contributions.

you might have a point if it was to the campaign.. but this is charity.. they take what they can get and they dont care if you are hitler, the money helps people. no charity would ever return money from an anti what ever.. its not the same as a political donation where you have the fears of like mindedness.
 




 fair enough, but i have lived from nyc to sc, been from cali to texas to washington.. and I have heard the term double park about a million times and have never heard it used for anything besides talking about someone taking up two spaces. Even in NYC. but i have also not been to an area where they are doing this 'double parking"(wiki def)

I guess its the difference between colloquial language and the proper defs.

but honestly i think most american redditors would agree, that the main way they have heard and used the term is for someone taking up two spaces.

thanks for the info that, didnt know the proper def. 




 [Hillary Clinton Praises Gay Marriage Decision and Hounds GOP](http://time.com/3938898/hillary-clinton-gay-marriage/)

[GOP presidential hopefuls deride gay marriage ruling, but differ on what to do about it](http://www.startribune.com/court-decisions-highlight-political-challenges-facing-gop/310250271/)

vote me into the ground if you want, but if you cant admit their is a difference between her response to the ruling and  the rights, you have a problem, not me. And not sure how you missed my first comment was about after the ruling, since i specifically mentioned people whining about it.. and not about her feeling prior. As for the date, that was the date of the video.

thats what my comment was about.. if she would accept the ruling and grow.. or attack the ruling like the right.

LIKE IT OR NOT SHE FUCKING PRAISED THE FUCKING RULING.

she is showing growth.

But hey why recognize that and praise someone for taking the first steps.. and instead pretend she is like the neanderthals talking about making an amendment to over turn it. Yeah thats a great way to advance the cause.


edit: hey downvoter.. dont want to debate? so your saying we should attack the people formerly against gay marriage who accept the ruling today, as much as the people fighting ot overturn it.. and you think that is helpful? I see they can downvote but not debate the issue, which suggests to me they dont have the capacity to support their position and are just downvoting out of spite.

 




 well you do know that the satanic bible was based on her writings, so says the author. Said satanism was basically randianism wrapped up in ceremony. not that it matters much but it is amusing considering the party that most embrasses her is highly christian.
 




 yeah she was against gay marriage when the majority of the country was. So was Obama. The real point, is do they grow and change with the times, like some have, or do they do like others and scream and yell about how its an affront to society?

[Hillary Clinton Praises Gay Marriage Decision and Hounds GOP](http://time.com/3938898/hillary-clinton-gay-marriage/)

downvoters say she never changed. Yeah this speach sounds just like the one in 2004. the point is people who ACCEPT IT and grow versus people who fight it.
 




 For me it doesnt matter really what it meant during the civil war. Its how it was used since. And it was mainly used by the klan before it was put up everywhere protesting desegregation.


and heres the thing, the swastika, used to be a sanskrit symbol meaning "well being".. people dont take kindly to it today, no matter how well being you think you are. Its not what it used to mean, its what it means today.

he could be 100% correct, it should still come down.

(side note, awful used to mean something that filled you with awe(like a general or king), try using it as a compliment today.. shit changes) 




 I moved to the south in HS a long long time ago. And that was one culture shock for me. At least where i lived in the north, there wasnt a lot of thought about the civil war.. it just was this war a long time ago. And we didnt really think of the divide. but when i came south, it was a bigger deal. not that thats all they talked about, but it was more important and they also saw themselves as more of a separate part of the us..not separated but a unique entity.. Than we did up north. To me living up north it was just geographic, but down south is the south.  and yeah i was taught it was all about states rights and questions of federal power. and many slaves fought for the south. and it was a strain between the industrialized north and the farming south that had been brewing since before we were even a country.. going back to the original disagreements when setting up the constitution over federal versus states power.

 




 it isnt that cut and dry and they are only trying to expand an existing service started by reagan. The phone program. TV is also considered a right which is why the government gave out the digital antenna to anyone who asked for one.

a lot of social services is moving online and that saves us money. As well as education and job services. and this isnt for everyone just the extreme poor and most of them will only get money off to buy internet.

one of the selling points giving them phones was they could get jobs. Now most of that, even the crap you find from the state offices, is all online and want online submissions.

but seriously if you say that, you dont have kids. You cant have a kid get educated today, without the net. half their lessons are online crap.

which is why so many schools give all students laptops.

welcome to the future.


 




 and they are talking about expanding the government subsidized phone service started by reagan, to include information access. So people have to tools to better themselves while working a min wage job when they cant afford to go to college. 

they arent talking about net for all.. or even most of us and even then, most of the people who do get it, will only get money off their bill.

its not quite how people are putting it like everyone in the us will get free net. its expanding a telecommunications program that already exists to include data.

you can still disagree but its only for people way below the poverty line and believe it or not more and more social service are being done online and that saves us money, but the poor have to find a kinkos or somewhere to email or fax the forms.


 




 actually you're wrong. telephone access is a basic human right according to our law. his comments were made to the idea of expanding that right to include internet.

They are talking about expanding the phone subsidy program for the poor, to include information access. what people stupidly call obamaphones.. as it started under reagan.

and since we are in ... cordcutters, tv is also a right, which is why the gov gave out all them free digital antennas cause so many of our people still get tv over the airwaves.. cause they cant afford cable.


 




 I'm actually surprised roberts been so vocal and so stupid in most his comments. I'm surprised that i actually agree with alito.. yes people will and have compared it to mixed marriages. CONGRATS for figuring that out. It didnt take the ruling though for us to figure that out.

and yes people who disagree with it will be labeled bigots by society.. which is the choice of society. Nothing forbids you from being a bigot. and to go back to his previous analogy, at one time it wasnt considered bigotry to think of black people as lesser people, our society as a majority accepted it. And times changed and now we call those hold outs to ancient ways, bigots. now in my opinion they always were but the point is it is society that actually decides if that label is appropriate. and... that doesnt take a ruling either.. cause we have been calling them ignorant bigots long before scotus said a word. but he is correct, they will have to put up with the growing reality that society see them as bigots.

 




 you kind of have to..  "sacrifices in vain" and such. like darkeox say, its why he got shot.

 




 the only moving part is the fan, so its the fan.

is there a danger of damage? sure.. it needs to keep the caps cool. It really depends on the psu, some handle wider temp ranges, but its summer and if gaming you will be taxing it.. and if its making noise air flow is probably compromised.

it wont explode.. but it might die.. i'm not even going to say the probability is high(short term).. but if you leave it like that for a long time, yeah.

make sure it is the psu fan and make sure nothing got sucked up in there thats just making noise by the fan hitting it.

you can probably think of it as noisy cv joints, or a squealing brakes.. sure you can drive but if you do a lot and tax it hard they can fail. and more so the cheaper they are.
 




 just cause [i wanted to verify some info..here is the response.](http://blogs.columbian.com/all-politics-is-local/case-closed-on-madores-silly-park-job/).

you can see in the pict, just to the left of that space is the turn for going to the other side. They say cars keep getting clipped.


though i kinda question the reasoning.. [since he used to just double park](http://blogs.columbian.com/all-politics-is-local/madores-park-job-is-meme-of-the-day/)

but to be fair, that is a shit spot to park.

and anyways it is plausible enough looking at that first pict, that i will put away my tar and feathers for now.(and uber dem here. so no not being biased)

 




 its not quite the same.. But i get your gist, people will drink diet drinks while consuming far too many calories and think the diet drink is helping. however this is just random observations.

[I figure the downvotes are due to it being inconclusive on why their is a positive correlation between drinking diet soda and waist size gain in older adults.](http://www.science20.com/news_articles/diet_soda_frequency_linked_to_waist_size_increases-154618)

I believe they arent sure if its has something to do with the alternative sugars and their digestibility, or does the ingestion of diet coke change eating habits.

er from a different link

In the new study, the researchers said that it is not clear exactly why drinking diet soda may be linked to an increase in waist circumference. But it may have something to do with the sweeteners used in diet soda, and the way they may affect food-intake regulation, Fowler said.


 




 I think there is probably at least some of that. Where people think that means dieting.

But i bet some of it is just from,  at least i am doing something. Not that they feel it is actually dieting.  It gives people some feel good about themselves when they arent actually really doing much at all. "i may not be exercising but at least i eat a fitness bar now and then, sure its not enough but its better than not doing anything"

its more about a small excuse to not feel as bad about not exercising.

and of course this is all just conjecture but I see some of myself in that in other subjects (too skinny for the diet concerns) but where i do just enough to feel better about not doing all of what i should. and you use it to help you excuse doing things you used to. "Damn i am running late for work and dont want to take the morning jog(hard), but i will eat this fitness bar at least"...(easy) and eventually the hard stuff gets less while you never miss that easy chocolatey bar.


 




 a little off but basically it.

The people.. told the legislators that they couldnt do it anymore.

they said the government must hire someone else.

This was done by referendum. These are little questions you can vote for at voting time. Like should we switch to this commision to draw districts, yes or no. Now this question is automatically added by the people, if enough people sign petitions to get them added.

the legislators who had the power removed from them, by the people. They didnt have any part of the referendum process, that was put on the ballots by the people and voted on by the people. The legislators simply lost the power to set the lines and were ordered to hire this commission to do it.

they are suing to get back the power, saying the US constitution says the job is the various state legislators(depending on how you read it) and cant be changed by vote by the people, without an amendment process. They are saying the referendum vote cant be binding in this case due to federal supremecy


 




  Each representative in Congress is basically there to speak for a limited number of people

it used to be much more limited. in 1800. each representative averaged 30k constituents. now it is 700k per rep. Of course had we kept the same numbers we would need a much bigger house, as it would have to hold 10,000 reps and their aids.

 




 well you are commenting in a thread where arizona is trying to change the method of gerrymandering... now they definitely arent selecting the condorcet method or anything close, but the fact is they are TRYING TO CHANGE IT. California did manage to change theirs.

i dont think we can dismiss that one day we can change it..

ok so they arent changing very far though.. i mean its light years from condorcet and not that far from normal.. but small changes can eventually lead to dramatic ones.


 




 well it does, after gerrymandering an area, what you tend to get is far more conservative/liberal people. the next census, it is these people who get to set the lines. yeah, sometimes the people can overcome even gerrymandering, but it tends to need the help of someone getting caught with their pants down.. otherwise it just gets reinforced more and more. And thats why we get people who can say the most idiotic shit you have ever heard and not lose their next election. they have the right team flag on their sleeve.
 




 yeah he does great videos explaining the problems, solutions and effects. most people dont think of the process, they just dont like the results. i bet most americans havent even considered the idea that their might be different ways of voting than first past the post.

and first past the post is kinda the default way voting starts and as such kinda feels like the way it should be, until you look at the flaws.
 




 thats what he is saying.. but one caveat.

but I absolutely assure you, Congress has the power to change the constitution.

Not without  ratification from 3/4th the states(their congresses and gov).. so no the federal congress cant do it alone.
 




 wow. it would never be ratified today. 




 well is it the old style rba without the big holes on the side?

people are drilling them out.
 




 OReillys statement is particularly surprising coming from a senior FCC official, given that the FCCs mandate is, among other things, to "encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans, according to the Telecommunications Act of 1996.

not really.

republicans put anti union people on the labor board.

they put young earthers and global warming denialist in charge of science.

and they made a man who said the un should be raised to the ground, as our lead diplomat to the institution.

its kinda their MO.

It could be praising israel. it could be praising you. All it does is take a mobile link and make the non mobile version which is helpful.

To vote it down is just retarded partisan politics. Its a thing.. it doesnt have an opinion.


 




 for nothing but educational access it is ridiculous to not provide the net to the poor.


screw getting the jobs and everything else.. the right always scream that the poor who work 60-80 hours a week at min wage barely feeding their family, just need to better themselves. Its not always possible or afford for them to go to college, but just maybe some of them, instead of staying in a dead end job that needs welfare assistance, might learn programming and help the us economically.
 




 pretty cool thanks. 




 One leaves on a spaceship at .99% of the speed of light and flies around for awhile. When he returns he finds he is much younger than his brother.

and if that first guy leaves at the 99% of the speed of light.. from the earth.. travels for a year, the second guy, left on earth, builds a better space craft.. this one goes 99.99% the speed of light.. and he sets off in search of his brother.

when they meet.. who is younger now?
 




 it banned selfie sticks because people refused to obey the rules on the rides.

 I was kinda shocked with how the state responded.

 wow how did you even intepret that that way.?

the coins had the graven image of caesar.
the reason they were asking jesus about paying taxes, is they were trying to trick him. See they figured he would say it was wrong, due to religious law. 

IT CONFLICTED WITH THE LAW OF GOD.

Jesus said, render unto ceaser, meaning the state cant make a sinner out of you, even though the graven image is a front to christianity.


and its not the only time they say that. They actually do say you should follow government because government was created by god.


romans 13

Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves

its a bit clear. but he clears it up more. So what happens if they are an anti christian dick?

Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended.

you still follow the law, but you also lead by good example and god will help.

but incase it isnt entirely clear.. he goes on.. romans 14

This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are Gods servants, who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.

if they tell you to respect and honor gay marriage you have to.
 




 Spending bill would also require religious experts to review recommendations for reproductive technique.

sigh. And what exactly is a religious expert? can you be one when everyone seems to choose what to believe? i know this is /r/science, but these same people dont put any effort behind keeping people from working on sundays compared to what they did to fight gay marriage.. well i have to question anyone who calls themselves an 'expert'.  the verses dealing with gay sex, was something 'god' told someone, where the not working on sunday thing, he wrote in stone... which is actually where we get the phrase, "written in stone" as a sign of permanence. 
 




 WOT?!?

1. lets see that gallup poll. I am interested in seeing it. Not sure the point. Are states banning reality tv? or are you saying the private markets are giving us reality tv when no one wants to watch it?

2. again what is the point? OP's own link shows in 2010.. most people were AGAINST gay marriage. But the scotus ruling did not occur in 2010. it occured in 2015 when MOST PEOPLE ARE FOR IT. are you just claiming that peoples views change over time? Sure i agree, peoples views do change. Not sure what any of that has to do with OPs chart or even the idea the title is trying to convey. please clarify for me.
 




 to be fair, your poll is a measurement of the US, they are talking about individual states, who often passed the bigoted anti gay shit by referendum.


edit; I aint going to claim they are talking about individual states,, cause well politics. I assume they are talking about individual states. 




 i do wonder, why the left doesnt do what the right would have done in this situation... "the supreme court once again slaps down".. obama.. "for his overreaching unamerican policies".. denying americans their god given rights. "this is a good day for america when the supreme court tells the left once again that what they are doing is wrong and illegal"

(yeah the parts out of quotes are just parts the GOP wouldnt say.. this comment is based on the bizzaro world where the GOP supports gay rights, but still respond to things in classic GOP fashion)

 I agree try the removal tool, though its probably best to do a clean install of windows, that will make it feel as new as possible and get rid of all the minor problems than can develop over time.

 Asked directly whether no Palestinian state would be created under his leadership, the prime minister answered: Indeed"

you cant ignore what he said before the election and then expect us to take for golden the shit he said after the election after attacked by the entire planet for the shit he said before the election. You also seem to skip the part about overwhelming the arab vote.. i wonder why.. maybe cause net didnt clarify that bigoted crap huh?

[Netanyahu apologises for warning about Arabs voting in election](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/23/netanyahu-apologises-arabs-israel-warning-voting-election)

we get it... you and net are doing the american southern strategy. YOU scream nigger nigger nigger, and when someone calls you on it you say you were misquoted and what you really wanted to talk about was bussing and charter schools. Same thing the right does. they try to scare right wingers that the minority vote is going to overwhelm theirs. same thing bigot net did.

so just ignore the mans actually words from his own lips.. and just claim he wants peace. GOT IT.


Sure, some people in Israel and Israel's government have no interest in diplomacy. So? I'm happy to say that, I'm perfectly comfortable with facts.

amazing you admit it.. thats a good first step.

Some Israeli settlers act like terrorists. The majority of them, and the majority of Israelis, do not support attacks on civilians.

this too.

This is false and unrelated

no it isnt, you are attacking me for things I never said. hense strawman.

how the fuck can it be unrelated when we are having this convo right now.. and you are purposefully misrepresenting what i said?


Do you mean 1948?

[nope. I meant 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War).. you do know the history of the area right? what the whole question about borders is? Most people today accept the 1948 ones.. its the 1967 ones that are the trouble,. Yeah i said 1968 over 1967 but it is more than remarkable you had no clue what i was talking about.
 




 they do it everywhere.

there is actually fertilizer lawn paint. you paint your lawn green and the ferts help it become green ..with proper watering.. later. [here is some grass paint, not sure if this is the one with ferts](http://www.lawnlift.com/products.asp?cc=)

its done a lot in certain communities where...browning grass or even new lawns are kinda frowned upon.. people even do it to sod.. when its just a little to light green from transport. and also used for spot hiding.. like dog urine spots which can really burn brown in the hot dry seasons. 




 NO. Not at all.

not even close.

but they are getting tighter on restrictions.

Now who to believe.. me? or itonlygetsworse. hmmm.. if there was only some way to tell.

[Rich Californians balk at limits: Were not all equal when it comes to water](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/rich-californians-youll-have-to-pry-the-hoses-from-our-cold-dead-hands/2015/06/13/fac6f998-0e39-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6_story.html)

oh wait there is.
 




 while i get the question, not sure the point.

the rebates weren't a win fall. this isnt a money many opportunity.. well unless you own a succulent store. The rebates cover PART of the costs.. to encourage people to do it.

the main reasons people do it, is maintenance.. its easier and you dont have to worry about the various restrictions on water usage that come now and then. Who cares if you can remember if you can water your lawn on wed, or thurs? you dont have to water your lawn at all.

so whats the point about putting an old lawn back in? if you just want to spend money on a meaningless exercise... maybe but otherwise there isnt any reason to do this.(yeah you might not like the low water plants, but why put them in in the first place? the rebate only gets you some of your expenditures back)



 




 did you see the post the other day on water? [one comment amused me.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/rich-californians-youll-have-to-pry-the-hoses-from-our-cold-dead-hands/2015/06/13/fac6f998-0e39-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6_story.html)

When we bought, we didnt plan on getting a place that looks like were living in an African savanna.

when while the area he lives in isnt 'african' it is actually a savanna 




  semi-arid

true but the point [he is making is the place is naturally brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-arid_climate#/media/File:The_semi-arid_terrain_of_Machakos_(5112045372\).jpg) 




 more than anyone else in the film, i felt like he would grow up to be doctor mccoy from the original series. He just had the char down pat 




 yeah.. wait spock? how is that possible.. ooooh.


damn reboots.
 




 imo, more olivia newton john than madonnas 




  No, it isn't. It's what Abbas admitted he would do back in 2009:

[Israel's PM Netanyahu: No Palestinian state on my watch](http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/16/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-palestinian-state/) he alo demanded right winger israelis overwelm the arab vote, which is pure bigotry. he was using fear like you right wingers always do.

derp much dude? i never said hamas was all the open arms people.. of cause you are talking about the other wing of palistine in your links.. but w/e I SAID THEY WERENT THE SOLE CAUSE.. as you pretend they are.

[Netanyahu admits on video he deceived US to destroy Oslo accord](http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/netanyahu-admits-on-video-he-deceived-us-to-destroy-oslo-accord)

lets do an experiment in bias and bigotry and we will see who is the full of shit one.

1. many in palistines leadership have zero interest in peace.

2. hamas military wing is a terrorist org that attacks innocent people

3. the palestinians and arabs helped start this when they went to war in 1968

Now let see you at least admit, that some people in israel and in their leadership have no interest in diplomacy.. you wont explode i promise.

admit that some israelis, especially the settlers act like terrorists.

can you admit any of that? nope. Sorry dude you are ignorant of the situation. I never denied palestine's shit stunk.. i denied that israelis shit smells like roses 100% of the time.

you are attacking strawmen.

 




 well except there are catholics there already and yes this is about letting them build more churches and do more catholic things there.

and if it is so useless why the hell did the right get so fucking upset leading up to this, and so fucking upset when it happened?


i find it interesting the right are all screaming.. the pope needs to stay out of it.. this isnt his business.

and then when it happens and goes against yalls demands "it doesnt matter, it is all meaningless"
 




 peace is impossible with an iraeli leadership that says they refuse to try to achieve peace.

you have no legs to stand on after nets election comments. You dont.

he didnt say "IF they renounce"

he said they would NEVER have a state.

#1 is just horseshit.. not only do they want palistine to agree to disputed borders israel claims before they will come to the table of diplomacy.. but they want israel.. the democracy, to be recognized as a permanent and solely jewish state. And well thats horseshit as well.

really, i think we should just take it away from both groups.. yeah you can live there but the entire area should become a world heritage site for abrahamic religions. And let them all come and live there. Jews, muslims christians. Dont mater and just let the UN run the place.. they created it anyways.

 




 so we demand they vote.. they vote for the wrong people and we take our ball and scream we aint gonna play anymore.
 




 I dont care if he quotes from a bubble gum wrapper as long as it is sourced.. which is better than the dude he is responding to.

you do see them blue underlined words in the blog. Click them. If they go to another blog, you have a point, if they go to legit media.. you dont.
 




  The Middle East/African voting bloc routinely gangs up on them for political/religious/fuck America's client state reasons.

because you say so right?

much like the right says the media is all liberal and they unfairly attack republicans when they point out that NO womens bodies dont have an off switch in case of rape.

Israel is anything but perfect, but they're far and away the best country in the region concerning human rights. 

when they arent runing over americans with bulldozers, kicking palestinians out of their own pools so settlers can use them instead of shooting at farmers harvesting their crops.. and denying gaza access to such dangerous items as biscuits and chocolates.

i dont deny that areas in the region dont have worse trouble.

But here is another rub.. you do realize what your comment is basically saying? its what cops hear all the fucking time.

"WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU BUSTING ME WHEN THERE ARE MURDERERS OUT THERE"

um cause you broke the law. saying their are worse people out their is no justification for breaking the law. It was the same thing the american right said about bush's torture program. "well in iran they do worse" 

so what. It doesnt make it right.  saying theri are worse people doesnt give you the high ground.



 




  The UN report was commissioned by the UNHRC, a body that has condemned Israel more than every other country in the world combined. That is not an unbiased investigation.

yep when ruled against, always claim bias.


I hear criminals who are arrested a lot.. they like to do that to. A dude down the street was arrested 4 times for meth. i havent been arrested once. I dont do meth. I guess the cops are biased against him. duh.


You may be interested in an extensive report [4] detailing how the UN relies on solely Palestinian amateur accounts, and fails to properly investigate.

LOL and israel controls entry into palistine for them to investigate.

LOL

**dude you still lose when you pretend everything is palistine when the leader of israel said they would not have a state on his watch.
**

it doesnt matter how wrong palestine is.. doesnt matter how many rockets. or the un lies. Or the gaza attack. Your dude said he has no interest in diplomacy and you want to put all the blame on palestine.
 




 "before coming to the negotiating table, we demand you give up key parts of the negotiation"

right wingers version of diplomancy.. its called I DONT FUCKING WANT TO DO IT SO I WILL PRETEND I DO.

it was the same with iran.. they demand iran end the nuclear program before we come to the table to discuss the nuclear program.

its solely designed to make it look like your willing to talk when you arent.

also recognizing israel.. they demand that innocuous thing all the time. why do they give a fuck? because it isnt innocuous. In order to recognize a state, you got to recognize the borders.. and they want palistine to give up claim to east jereselum before coming to the table.

**and taaravakin after the election, you really dont have a leg to stand on to claim high ground.**

The bigot fuck net, showed his bigot ass on tv. You cant scream that israelis much counter the israeli arab vote or scream that palestine will never be a state on his watch and then try to claim you are the reasonable one, and its all palestine who wont come to the table.

seriously dude, how the fuck do you think you could? ignoring the left right aspect.. seriously how the fuck do you think you can blame everything on hamas and palistine in the face of the comments of net during the last election? That just baffles me. i can understand bias and your feelings but to be willing to open your mouth in the face of a reality that plainly denies what you are saying, is quite interesting. Do you want to claim the sun is purple? 




 not really, just some biased person trying to dillute it.



The Vatican has agreed to a new treaty with Palestinian representatives that refers to them as the State of Palestine, which the Associated Press is reporting as formal recognition of Palestine as a state. A Vatican spokesman told AP, "Yes, it's a recognition that the state exists."
The Vatican recognized Palestine as a state after a 2012 UN vote, but this is the first official agreement the Vatican has concluded that recognizes "the state of Palestine." 

saying "hey we think you are a state" is all and great in 2012.. putting it down on paper is saying .. WE MEAN IT.


and [for something meaningless.. they were immediately attacked for it.]
(http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/vatican-recognizes-state-palestine-new-treaty-n358286)

i guess the left shouldnt cheer, but the rigth are allowed to attack.

**thats right folks.. the left are making a huge deal about absolutely nothing just for political and media purposes... and right wingers like the one above, also totally feel it is nothing.**  

/s

sorry dude, if republicans can attack the pope for dare recognizing palistinian statehood with this treaty, we can cheer it.

edit: dederped a link
 




 It will only convince the Palestinian leadership that they need not unify and reform, or negotiate, as Netanyahu has offered to do and Abbas has refused.

thats why the downvotes dude.. thats a bit more than simplistic.

net was on record in his election for saying they would never ever get a state.

and now you want to pretend that it is israel that is all open to compromise but them dirty palistinians are standing in the way of theri own statehood.

and well thats a horse shit view of the situation. Yes many in hamas dont want negotiations. they gained power and maintain power through conflict with the israels.. MUCH LIKE LIKUD,, who derives its power from the conflict with the palestinians.

I didnt downvote you.. but i would have upvoted you without that stupid line based on ignorance.

 




 yea and that was the fears at the time.. But you know some line in the sand type folks.. said fuck you this is our flag.

though in hindsight it is fitting.
 




 eh i am discussing both.. i would like to hear about the ignorance and bigotry that designed these other flags so i can judge if it is similar. But i remain skeptical without examples. I will never TIL from a sourceless comment.
 




 No one is denying that.

but people being racist, doesnt all of a sudden equate that they designed their flags for racist reasons. Some of us need a bit more proof. and if you know european history.. then share. 


give me one single flag that was created for racist reasons. I WANT TO LEARN.
 




 ok educate me, I like flags but not really an aficionado and well this is the net, and people just saying things that are sorta vague.. well give me some examples man. not doubting you, not educated enough on the various flags to actually deny your claim. So cure my ignorance.

like one example i for the longest time was misinformed that the black in the jamaican flag represented black people, but if you look the original meaning was hardship. I was misinformed by someone who claimed to know. And rather than google every flag in europe and africa, if you could give me examples so i can verify you arent like my friend, and i can make a better decision on why they made their flags the way they did.

I mean if you do find a flag where the white represented "the people" in a mostly homogenous nation of white people, i dont think that really counts in the same way. They didnt make the flag for whites.. its just their nation didnt have black people in it when the flag was made.
 




 i dont see it.

We will put massive pressure on them. and do you think the nsa doesnt have a dossier on her? private info they could use to pressure? i am slightly hopeful cause france told us to fuck off over iraq but that was quite some time ago and the beast has only grown since then/.
 




 Horseshit. I dont know if you were educated in the south, or just falling for some spun ass nonsense.

Yes it came back in the civil rights era.. but even back in the civil war it was pure racism.

here

[Heres the Racist Meaning Of the Confederate Flag, In the Words of the Man Who Designed It](http://mic.com/articles/121082/here-s-the-racist-meaning-of-the-confederate-flag-in-the-words-of-the-man-who-designed-it)

transcribed from the picture.

it would soon rank among the proudest ensigns of the nations and be hailed by the civilized world as THE WHITE MAN'S FLAG.

IT was always bigoted.

it also represented the confederacy.. which we will ignore was the enemy. The confederacy constitution in the preamble said it was all about slavery.. and that white people have the inalienable right to own blacks.


and you can read quotes from the [confederate leaders at the start of the war](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/what-this-cruel-war-was-over/396482/)

your falling for the same horseshit, this bigoed asshol is spewing. Sorry but its a total aberration of history to claim this flag had anything at all to do with anything but bigotry. **From the flag creator, to the constitution ot their leaders, they all admit it it was all about bigotry. not sure why so many cant today.**

 




 semantics.
 




 While i wish he would. Seems like a good idea and all, you cant pick a good guy and then just complain hes not doing enough. because you can always find more things he could do.

should he invest in these companies, maybe not, but not going to become a gates hater over it. And his investing doesnt really change anything, its demand and governments are the only thing that can.. its not like the oil companies will go out of business cause gates sold their stock. Really everyone could, and it might hurt some ceos a little, but mostly all it would do is decrease the price/earnings ratio.. make the stock look more attractive.

 




 [unchecky is a godsend.. ](http://unchecky.com/) 




 this is unfathomable. 




 Bristol Palin later became a paid spokeswoman advocating abstinence 

well..

[Non-Profit Pays Bristol Palin $262,500, Donates Only $35,000 to Charity](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/04/06/non-profit-pays-bristol-palin-262500-donates-only-35000-to-charity/)

but i guess abstinese education doesnt cost a lot.

 




 she does more than preach.. [she got paid nearly 300k to work at a non profit designed to prevent teen pregnancies.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/04/06/non-profit-pays-bristol-palin-262500-donates-only-35000-to-charity/) (they only spent 35k on preventing pregnacies. lol but to be fair, it doesnt cost much to say 'dont fuck')

anyone can say you shouldnt smoke and then be caught smoking, but to run an smoking group, and get caught, well thats a bigger story. 




 point out ones hypocrisy and showing that the ideas they present for others, failed themselves, is not shaming her.

see if it was the Obamas girls, some words like "trash" would come up, there would be a huge deal if she wasnt married, because you know black people are like that. etc

hypocracy like ignorance is curable, who you are isnt. now maybe there is media out there calling her trash.. i dont know i dont watch a lot fo the tv news, so if there is, i appologize but.. i'm just calling her a hypocrite. She could otherwise be a fine, nice young lady. 




 idk, in election season when we still have the same types out their promoting this crap, its still a good example for why its a bad idea. It really wouldnt matter that it was the palins.. or the obamas to be honest.. republican, dem i dont care. Not the point. She and her family promoted abstinence. She also LEAD a teen pregnancy prevention non profit.  Just like anti gay guys turning out to be gay... I'm not so sure I agree with you on the burying, as fox wouldnt bury it if it wasnt a republican. People like to read about that kind of stark hypocrisy and most of the time the media gives it to us.  




 why not post at /r/legaladvice 
there probably is some tax advice subreddit.. idk

but heres what i know.

the $600 requirement isnt directed at you the payee. The $600 requirement is directed at them, the payor.

IF they pay any individual over $600 they are required to send you and the irs a 1099.  That is a requirement directed at the people who pay you. But it is to help them catch a lot of people that have been going under the radar.. people who get paid small chump change.

now here is the part your not going to like. Thats just the reporting requirements of the people who pay you. YOU are supposed to file taxes anyways. Even on just that $300. No really, your supposed to list it as income.

but like paying sales tax for catalogues, almost no one actually files the taxes unless they get a 1099 or earn over $600 from one company. and almost no one gets in trouble. The thing is they dont file a 1099 on you until you get over 600.. so... the irs doesnt really know you made 300. Could you get in trouble, sure, and your mom could get in trouble for not paying sales tax on all her catalogue purchases like no one has ever done ever but are supposed to do. But most likely you wont.(if you did it a fuck ton, maybe.. like split it up in 500 dollar chunks between 100 companies.. well it might become noticeable) and really the irs is too broke to go after little fish rn. the right punished them for the irsgate nonsense and cut their budget a lot and obamacare added a fuck ton more work for them. so they kinda up to theri necks right now.

not a lawyer, or an accountant, or work for the irs, take this for what you will, but I attest it is mostly true. :)
 




 enhanced interrogation sounds much nicer. 




 I kinda think he was being humorous, kinda saying they are just taking the long trip to designing a desktop pc.

but yeah i do think people wouldnt mind a station they could plug in the laptop at home for more gaming..  




 The proposed bill is aimed at cracking down on the visual blight that occurs when vehicle owners store cars that dont work on their property.

how about address the problem? Just make sure they dont let cars fall apart on the streets. There should be zero reason you cant put a non working car under a car cover, or maintain it by washing a non working car or even a working car, while you get on your feet until you can afford insurance and legally drive. the problem isnt a lack of plates. the problem is letting cars get covered in crud and look like shit. 

when they do this, i question the motive, because it would be easy to target the actual problem rather than throw out a broad net and make everyone park face forward in theri drive ways and have plates seen from the streets to make sure theri car isnt visual blight? how the fuck does a plate not make it a visual blight? can i put a plate on a car and let it sit there with flat tires, covered in crude and concert fliers? thats what they are saying? they cant tell the visual blight cars without a plate..er what? if you cant tell you cant argue its a visual blight.

 




 there is no obamacare.. there is exchanges for the market place to compete for people on the individual market all in one place.. and some subsidies and crap. This is republicans counting on their base not knowing wtf Obamacare is.

they are trying to say it is so distasteful to get insurance this way that teh supreme court justices would refuse or something. Yeah it would end up costing them more than the free insurance they are provided.. but its just fucking insurance. There is no special obama to it. Its the same insurance you get at work.. just at work its cheaper because it is bought in bulk. this is a way to bring the costs down on the individual market.


anyways its a bit hilarious petty to try to punish scotus for a ruling they didnt like. Can you imagine if Obama tried to punish scotus  for ruling against his recess appointments or his abortion center buffer zone? I think he would already be under impeachment.
 




 [not real](http://m.snopes.com/texas-woman-pregnant-by-pig/)


and come on who would report it to the media? her hyper religious parents? 




 well except it IS working. 




 no 20% healthcare costs isnt a positive, but it is in a positive direction compared to the 35% we were starting to see.

i swear some people do all they can to not admit things like that. we are mostly all in agreement on single payer. Most of us think obamacare isnt that great.. but its better than what we had.

 




 the jobless young people will get subsidies or medicare.. the ones with jobs will have to pay.
 




 and now your just being a dick. the concept that everyone should have perfect prose, when not everyone is english or grammatically oriented and considering the various idiocies of the language is a bit extreme. So I must assume you are just being a prick. Good on you. you right short worthless comments that are perfectly punctuated.  I wonder how you are at calculous.

this place is casual in nature and the comments are disposable. No one is going to read this tomorrow. And just like when i make mock devices of something i want to build. I dont make it perfect. I make it good enough to work. I find people like you just want to hijack the convo and make it about grammar rather than discussing the content of the comment someone made. Its a bit low effort.
 




 I have a feeling you happen to be a libertarian/right winger version of an atheist? Most people didnt seem to actually have that much trouble understanding the concepts, that i was trying to convey.  While admittedly it isnt the cleanest prose, it is hardly as incoherent as your post. I suspect, your disagreement has more to do with politics than punctuation.
 




 i did miss use some punctuation, but I'm not trying to be published, just talking with like minded friends. I'd definitely clean my work up for commercial or educational purposes, but i tend to not proof read or care as much when its idle conversation. Not that its a valid excuse to write so poorly, but it is what it is.
 




 true but you got to give it to her for keeping her eye on the ball. she had a razor focus, and yeah in slow mo, but as a crappy golfer myself, i'm easily distracted by anything but the ball.
 




 they could afford to do both, often it has to do more with regulatory ideas.. and google wants to be able to reach everyone.. while fiber is great, there is a reason why they want free wifi...and NYC is a bit of a hotbed of tourism.. tourist walking around town.. needing info...on where to go. Google is mainly an advertising company. Tourists are some of the best cut of the consumer meat.  




 she wasnt wrong.. you people dont get it.

When conservatives fail and become pregnant it is called being human.. and has nothing to do with the abstinence.

when liberals do, its due to their crappy ideology that encourages teens to get pregnant as soon and as often as possible with as many species as possible.

(and yeah this is about religion, but its the right winger version that tries to force the ideas on others, where the left winger version might believe that it is wrong but believe in leading by example over leading by legislation)

**edit:** and to forgive the right a little in this concept, people in general tend to do this-- just this current subject is more conservative.But we tend to judge ourselves by our intentions,while we judge others by their actions. When i cut you off, its an accident, i was a little off today.. sorry. When you cut me off its cause your a fucking idiot who doesnt know how to fucking drive and prolly got his dl in a box of cracker jacks anyways.(eh atheism isnt the politics of left versus right and wanted to pull back a little)
 




 Both... well now looks like just one. 
Warm waters tend to bleach corals, while acidification makes it harder to get the carbon to make theri structures.

This article however is stating that some species will do ok, and so it will adjust, but some will die out. and its mainly investigating why some corals can rapidly adapt to temps while other species cant.

unlike the title, the study isnt saying that.. it says they can and are and will be adapting to a warmer ocean. Not to global warming itself, since that includes not only warming but the acidification.(which i believe would also happen with natural warming but much latter due to co2 feedback from warmth.. whereas with  AGW we put the co2 into the air already)

Now i guess someone might say.. well wait, if they say some corals evolved from warmer times and other corals that evolved from those corals have an easier time evolving with the heat than those who didnt have such a past. Shouldnt they have the same with acid.. since i say it will get acidic anyways. And while i am not in this field.. I would have to say no this doesnt prove that. While it might prove the corals have mechanism for quickly dealing with quickly rising temps, it doesnt show it has the mechanism to survive with quickly rising acidity even if its ancestors survived in a more acidic environment..  




 well its more than 'cant stand the heat'

and most of the argument is actually that its better AND CHEAPER to mitigate some of the problems now, than wait until later when its much more expensive and harder to do.

almost no one says humans will die out.

and had we started sooner, like in the 2000s with the plans on the tables back then, we would have been able to mitigate the effects even more.. the longer we wait, the more we will have to "just deal with"
 




 ok on the first sentence, bah on the second.

thats just click bait bs.

had 911 been successful the deaths would have been much higher.. but one plane crashed in a field and another the terrorists never made it on.

and judging how many would die on success is a bit of an art than science.  you can make some guesses, but they are only really educated guesses.
 




 kinda unfortunately reddit doesnt allow editing titles even to self posts. I get some of the dangers but you could easily implement some tracking of changes like wiki where people can click and see past titles and such and make up their own minds if shenanigans is going on or if the changes were legit.

there have been a couple posts of mine, that made it to teh front of reddit, where comment information changed what the title should say.. and my title was suddenly misleading IMO and i couldnt do anything about it.. and since so many people dont click through or read the comments, .. i was doing damage that i couldnt stop.

i am glad these days they have at least let mods add a little flair to titles so they can say "debunked".. or "mirror in comments".."not real, viral ad" but they really should let us to fix titles... hey send a message to everyone who voted that the title was changed to let them change theri vote.. fine, but they should let us fix titles.

 




 yeah, having messed with markup over the years, while this might not be aesthetically pleasing compared to some more graphic articles. Its extremely pleasing in the medium it was done in. 




 yeah  good point but i bet it is still pretty similar. your just going to know more about those industries if you live there.  Your going to have relatives and friends in them. And your more likely to hear info, that you might not hear from other sources. And the local consumable media tends to be biased towards the local industries. yoru going to get a more positive view. 




 my grands house still has the old ones inside.. for a few storage areas. I developed a thing for big ass old keys for a short time as a kid.
 




 YOu still cant seem to grasp the point.

tell me is theri a difference between what a klan uniform is designed for, and what a bed sheet is designed for? think anyone was raped on a bed sheet? well bigotry and rape are both wrong but ONE IS DESIGNED FOR THE PURPOSE OF BIGOTRY.. the other wasnt designed for rape.. it was just used that way.

same with your examples. You fail because the conservative flag was designed for bigotry.. read their constitution as well as the words of the dude who created it who put it on an all white background because it was the white mans flag.

and it was put up all over the south SPECIFICALLY for bigotry reasons to protest desegregation.

YES THE AMERICAN FLAG HAS BEEN ABUSED.. just like a rape happening on a bed sheet. But the american flag wasnt designed to promote abuse, nation building or anything else. 

THE CONFEDERATE FLAG WAS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE BIGOTRY.

not sure why yall dont get the different between use and abuse.


maybe i should try the right winger verision.

And electric chair purpose is to kill people.

thats not always true with guns., especially things like shot guns which were explicitly designed for hunting. But people do kill people with shot guns. That is abusing the guns purpose.  The chair on the other hand HAS THE SOLE PURPOSE of killing people.

its the same difference between the american flag, which was designed to be the flag of this nation, versus the confederate flag which was designed to be the flag of the white man.. in the designers own words.
 




 yeah and he wrote about how much the golds gym ideology helped promote his madness.

derp much dude?
 




 MOTHER FUCKER.

the civil war was fought over slavery.. its in theri constitution

Motehr fucker.. the flag was put up only to protest civil rights by threatening a new civil war.. it wasnt put up to celebrate any heritage or history.

the american flag... while it has been abused all over.. wasnt designed to be bigoted. And the pyramids while built by egyptions werent designed solely to spit in the face of the jews.

the confederate flag was. Thats why yall put it up during civil rights, and not at some special civil war holiday.

besides its the fucking enemy of the us.

you do realize many fucking germans have nazis as relatives? you dont think it would be condemened by the planet for parts of germany to start to display that flag all over their governments for "heritage" reasons

DONT BE A JACKASS MOTHERFUCKER.

we can debate the issue without either side being jackassses MOTHERFUCKER.


 




 yeah i actually think its a bit retarded what apple did.

but the flag was addopted by the klan to attack blacks with.

it was never historically part of SC besides for the klan.

until the civil rights era when right wingers threatened a new civil war.. and raised the northern virgina regiments flag all over the south.

most people dont have a problem with the flag.. the problem is when the governments promote it. and even if you scream heritage which is pretty ignorant since it wasnt put up to celebrate teh civil war but to fight civil rights, its the flag of the enemy of the US. and right wingers got upset and legit so, when a small spanish town had the mexican flag flying over the post office. This is america. but see historically that small spanish town.. USED TO BE MEXICO.. they have heritage as well. Doesnt matter This is america. They can fly the flag at their homes but leave the government out of it.

right wingers seem to grasp that in all things until the government promotes theri ideas and then they all play dumb.


well just like the mexican flag doesnt belong flying over any gov building in mexico the losing confederate flag has zero business flying over gov buildings in the US. The gov should be as generic as it comes when it comes to promoting of ideas. 

you dont need a fucking christmas display at the state house.. what fucking purpose does that serve besides telling non christians that this is a christian biased state?

we shouldnt have speciality plates for your car.. people cant afford a fucking bumper sticker?


shit from the gov should be cold generic and limited to the state flag and the us flag.

you can celebrate heritage and ideas at home. 




 so making less than min wage, is hard to keep up motivation.. who knew.(yeah i know many of us just use it as a way to get money you dont feel bad about blowing and have other income.. still point stands.. below min wage as far as the buying power it affords is not very motivating once you have already eaten)

and to ramble on, it doesnt even have to be about money.. you can see it some in games and things. scbuildit is an ok game on the android. They have these things called expansion items which let you expand your territory, they are semi rare in finding. but after so many clicks on average you will get one. well they just updated the game, adding a different expansion area and 3 more expansion parts.. the gist of it all is that it now takes more clicks to expand the game than it did before... basically they cut my imaginary game salary i got for the labor i did in click bubbles. and well i am not motivated to play anymore.




yeah everyone goes through it.  




 yeah annoying af 




 you are actually going to link teh american shitter to help this dude understand? fuck might as well linked what teh council of conservative citizens thinks on it.(for teh canadian the american shitter simply exists to attack the left in all things, doesnt matter what it is, a right winger could shoot another right winger in the face and it would be the lefts fault.. they complain fox was attacked when fox tried to claim it wasnt about race.. it ws about christians and was due to obama and affirmative action.. they deserved attack.)

could you get a more partisan hyper right winger source?

teh flag wasnt in use in most of the south.. it was the battle flag of the northern virginia regiment of the confederacy. IT WAS HOWEVER adopted by hyper bigot groups like the klan.. and until teh civil rights era, thats pretty much the only people who used it. 



but really dont read that american shitter article.. you will just get more misinformed..AND YEAH I WOULD SAY THE SAME IF IT WAS AN ARTICLE FROM THE BLACK PANTHERS.

you simply wont get any sort of a view of reality from people as partisan as the american shitter or the black panthers.


edit: ok i guess your trying to show how the right are being.. it wasnt totally clear by your link title.

teh [confederate flag is basically an extension of the rights bigoted southern strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) designed specifically to foster distrust betweeen the the races in order to attract the bigot vote, who fled the dem party when the dems adopted civil rights. and its the main reason for the wink wink nudge nudge.. no it isnt about racism
 




 but there are still problems with that concept.


for a more cogent example than the ones we have used. Some of the more people based and vague laws.. like indecency. If you look back at how a person in the 1700 might interpret indecency laws... well women today still wouldnt be allowed show above their ankles 




 so that means no free speech on computers because no one in the 1700s would have interpret it to include these type devices. ...

ok some might take exception with my example but the problem with his view is that society progresses. People in teh 1700 might not think free speech applies to hustler but then again they didnt have a concept of magazine and porn of that nature.

thats not to say certain laws dont actually NEED to be fixed to adjust with the times, but some we just shouldnt have to.. just because the medium changes.

you can say i am reading too much into how he does things but there are concepts that it just doesnt seem to make sense to say 'how would someone from 300 years ago interpret this' 




 they actually used to look like that.. which is why the graphic stuck around... sorta like the save button in word programs often looks like a diskette.


and [phones dont look like this](http://4vector.com/i/free-vector-phone-clip-art_110132_Phone_clip_art_hight.png)

but of course a plain white square on a black background might not say phone to people these days so prolly best we kept the old model graphic. :)
 




 its pretty cool.. but i wonder why this hasnt been done sooner. 

People doing bitcoin have been making theri cards external for a long time now with risers. i get it isnt quite the same but it also isnt quite that far away from it all.
 




 from the link click through in the article just cause i liked it.

In the mid-1980s, after consulting with Drucker, furniture maker Herman Miller (MLHR) agreed that its CEO's pay would be restricted to 20 times the average of all its employees. "The subtle part of this limit was the message to the CEO: If you want to get more pay, you need to do it by raising the average pay" of everyone at the company.

thats teem work. everyone from the janitor to the ceo working on the same goals. And i bet all feel valued like part of a company rather than a worthless product to be dropped on a whim. 




 they should fight for basic income over fighting for jobs. 




 one of the problems that society is facing and will get worse, is the jobs are going to disappear. Its the evolutionary direction of technology.. its kinda the point. We invent things to do the things we dont like to do for us. To free up time to do other things.  We dont have to wash our own clothes by hand which takes forever and is hard and sucks.. we throw it in a big white box, push a button and go do something else.

The luddites were before their time for sure, when technology came for the unskilled jobs, besides new unskilled jobs were created, people could better themselves as some like to cry. But there was a growth in need for skilled labor. Well now they are coming for the skilled jobs, and theres not going to be anywhere for humans to better ourselves into.. there is skilled or unskilled.. there isnt another rung.

at that point the only people with wealth, are those that own the means of production and all the robots.

there will probably be reforms we dont like that are needed as we implement BI.. but eventually there wont be a lot of choice, unless we just want to watch a lot of society die off.and yeah thats a bit off.. but it is the eventual course technology takes us.(and sorry but soon enough computers will even be better programmers than us, so saying everyone will just have jobs making the robots, well robots will take those jobs too eventually)

and yeah, i'm just an insane redditor.. lots of people make excuses and babble about shit that just has no bearing on reality. but luckily i aint the only one that says this.

[Bill Gates thinks super machines could eventually become smarter than humans and take our jobs](http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-artificial-intelligence-2015-3) (who wouldnt be the type of person to make up luddite conspiracy stories cause they are stuck in a dead end min wage job) 




 well after arguing with one of them anti gov types on why the government NEEDs to do min wage(under current system).. who uses similar verbiage.... I have to say i do agree with you, and him, but only if their was a BI already. 

I very much disagree without it, as you can see the effects of not having one in our history and in other countries right now, as our corps like walmart try to go back to paying people in corporate script or walmart bucks that could only be spent at the company store .. in mexico. Its the same games of desperation the robber barons did in the past. The reason the magic doesnt work, is people NEED TO EAT... its sign the contract or starve.. you can say there are others.. but the point is eventually YOU HAVE to sign one.. or starve or turn to crime. With a BI this opens the freedom for the magic of the markets to actually be realized. being able to eat people can sign the contracts based on the value of their labor hours and not the value of not starving to death.(which you can imagine.. is quite low.. I mean if someone was literally starving in front of you, you could probably get a fuck ton of labor for a sandwich)


**tl;dr** the contractional freedoms thing doesnt work without BI, cause the guy hiring can wait longer for an employee than the hirees can wait for food.
 




 not really.

i mean there are arguments against gravity too but the thing is their are things called experiments and we got 50 states of them, many had min wages before the fed government. They didnt add them for no fucking reason. They added them because we already tried it your way.

you can also see it being abused by american companies in mexico where they pay peopl ethey way you folks want.. in walmart script.. where the employees couldnt spend their pay anywhere but the company store.

you can see the problems in china to where people have to deal with the conditions we fought to get out of. Working fo 25 cents an hour, locked in a factory with no ac and many work place accidents.

this shit didnt come because some leftie had a wet dream

it came because people were suffering from trying its yalls way

the world wasnt invented with min wage

we tried it your way for years

I dont know why yall dont understand that

we tried your way

IT FAILED

bad

PS states with a higher "price floor" did better than those who didnt.

thats calls a failure of hypothesis.

[States That Raised Minimum Wage See Faster Job Growth, Report Says](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/07/19/332879409/states-that-raised-minimum-wage-see-faster-job-growth-report-says)
 




 well this is a horse shit view.
you same people say some of the problems with college is not everyone can go.

like it or not people do work for life with families at min wage, despite you right wingers pretending this isnt true.


and for less than they did in 1968 despite american is twice as rich per capita and adjusted for inflation.. people like you demand they work for less than they did in 1968.

and yeah we get why right wingers spread these bullshit memes. Its because most people who do work min wage for life, raising familys working 80 hours a week as people like you call them lazy and tell them they need to go back to school and better themselves while working 80 hours a week and raising a family and cry if they ask for help. Sorry dude the reality is people do and have always worked for min wage as a living. and saying "just better yourself" is some ignorant fox news watching mother fucking shit on the state of america today.
