 Even more annoying was that Harbs and Roman claimed they watered the down the playbook and simplified it this offseason 




 I've driven in many different countries as well as states, and by far the worst drivers (mainly taxi) are here in NY.  My theory is that the majority of this city goes by public transportation, and having access to a car is much harder.  Therefore, not experienced.  

I've also heard native NY'ers claim they wanted a service/driving job in the city (police, etc) b.c they wanted to drive a car.   




 There's also this other guy, he's called Jim Harbaugh, aka as the Head Coach.  But of course, he's never to blame right?  He only sits in every meeting for game planning, has the final call as to what the play calling should be etc.  Yeah Roman and Kaep are the biggest reasons.   




 Posted this in a similar thread:  
If you look at the past 3 seasons, it's been a different team in stark contrasts.
 Year 1, Harbaugh and Roman simplify the playbook and cater to Alex strengths. Remember the genius naked QB bootleg against the Saints in the playoffs? Where has that gone? The offense that year was pretty dismal at times, but we played really disciplined. There were a lot of shits, 2 TE sets, etc. Low scoring affairs, but the D was monster that year.

Year 2, we unleash Colin and the read option. Now the O is passing down the field more often, letting Colin run wild. In all the midst of it, the play calling changed and started to see more delay of games, weird run calls, etc. Let's not forget the last play of the Super Bowl.

Year 3. In the off season, both Harbs and Roman both agreed to clean and simplify the calls and terminology. What happened to our 2TE sets, or jumbo package for ground and pound?  How come Kap still throws 90+ mph fastballs to his receivers only a few feet away?  All these what and why ?s 




 It kills me when he throws a bullet to a WR 4 yards away.   




 Nah ignorance will supersede that 




 The way the offense has looked, we're not deserving of a SuperBowl.  This may sound weird, but I'd rather not make playoffs, so that in the offseason we clean up the roster and revise the playbook.  




 If this were to happen, there needs to be strict guidelines.  For instance, if the the officer tried to take off or disconnect the camera deliberately, their ass is fired.  

If I were a honest cop, why wouldn't you want a body camera? 




 Reggie Miller made a living out kicking his leg out.  Lin's fadeway wasn't even close to the same kick leg as Reggies 




 Is there a specific # of years thats determined for all this?  Curious bc of similar incidents such as Penn State Jerry Sandusky, or the sexual abuse from the Catholic Churches.  Those events happened many years ago but the perpetrators were still prosecuted  




 It's incredible how many ally oops we've had this season compare to last 




 Can't tell, but did you keep the head on?   




 I got to watch S Dot a lot last year living in NY.  The thing I loved the most is the height advantage he has over most PG's.  His ability to post up and defend smaller guards really creates mismatches.  Give him a few more weeks and you will see exactly why Dubs picked him up.   




 Which last time I checked, dancing naked was illegal and people have been arrested for it.  Why this guy want charged is straight up baffling 




 I'm sorry, am I the only one that finds it wrong he wasn't charged?  Just bc you lose your shit doesn't mean you can parade in public naked making a scene.   




 Just wondering, but can the same be applied to the bicyclist that hit and killed the woman in Central Park?

Although we're getting better at delay of games, it's night and day when you compare how the offense has looked.  I've never seen a team change identity so quickly.  To answer your question, yes I believe Roman is the problem.   




 And the person prior to that copied as well.  These are moves that have been around forever.  MJ crafted his own style from it.   




 Down to tail gate and pre party!  I'll be taking the train in with a buddy of mine.   




 Lynch is still learning schemes is primarily used on pass rushing downs.  Once Aldon comes back it'll be interesting to see what packages they will be using 




 When Livingston is running the 2nd unit, he'll be expected to distribute and be a pass first PG.   




 It's more like a 3 year window.  Look at OKC a few years back and that should tell you how quickly things change in the league.   




 UCC Coffee!! 









 On a similar note, Chinese food in Japan is pretty awesome.  Dishes like mabo tofu and tan tan men are good examples of that  




 Almost every time these "foods around the world, breakfast from every country" album pops up, they're entirely inaccurate.  Plus, I've never seen okonomiyaki look like the one posted in the pic.   




 Doubt it these days.  Last year, there were a few threads that really bashed Fitz.   




 This guy must destroy people in Jenga 




 curious what neighborhood did this took place in? 




 Contact Make A Wish Foundation.  See how they can assist 




 Asian guy here, but it's not too weird imo.  I got my "office" voice, and then my "kick it with the boys" voice.  2 completely different voices, 1 being.   




 His TD pass to Boldin against St.Louis was very Brett Farve like 




 How's the toe AJ?   




 He most certainly has looked more comfortable in the pocket.  His TD throw to Boldin was very Bret Farve like 




 Or go animal fries 




 But he also can wear out the other "4" because of his quickness.  I'm surprised they never tried a Steph, Klay, AI, Barnes, Bogut lineup 




 Kaep looked a little like Bret Farve on that TD throw to Boldin 




 Bogut didn't play in FIBA this year. I do think it raised Klay's confidence a little, but he's been working on his game all summer regardless of FIBA 




 Yup, certain sec at the Stick were regulated hardcore.  They knew the usher's name and would yell at the front row fans to always sit down.   




 NYC 




 I don't think its cocky.  It's his shot selection which I'm surprised more people don't mention about.  There's times he"ll pull up a fadeaway 3 with 2 defenders in his face.  
 




 And, no team had signed him so he's extra salty 




 Its bc a lot of these "fans" feel as though Harbaugh did the wrong thing by benching Alex Smith in favor of Kap.  Lotta salt from that wound 




 Must be a slow news day for Monte pool 




 There's times the 49ers resemble a college team based on their formations and shifting.  It's really predictable at times 




 007-373-5963 




 Other than Justin Smith's sack, the pass rush wasn't that impressive.  Similar to the Dallas game, it seemed as though we barely got to the QB.  Is this all because we're missing Aldon, or something else?     




 Why were soo pass happy?  Not just that, but the receivers were running long routes, 15+ patterns?   




 Anyone ever mistake you for [ronlivingston?](http://filmnewreleases.blogspot.com/2011/04/ron-livingston-in-game-change.html) 









 This wasn't my personal recollection, but I remember someone telling a story about this on  this subreddit.  

Soon after the first tower was hit, people living in BK began walking on the BK bridge to get home.  There were hundreds of people all in a frenzy.  In the midst of all the chaos stood a huge motorycyle cop, shirt burned and halfway torn off.  He had swastikas and other crazy tats all over his body.    But what struck me was the tears streaming down his face as he was  guiding traffic.  

 




 That's the black stallion 




 The owners need to band together and make a statement.  That might get the ball rolling, but it's hard to imagine Goodell stepping down from all this.  NFL is in major damage control right now, and will try everything in it's power to make themselves look competent 




 Boomer is borderline awkward when he tries to force his hand on topics.  His morning show is even worse 




 With the NFL having to play damage control, I can't help but think Goodell will try and bring down the hammer regardless of the verdict pertaining to Ray McDonald.  It's the leagues way of compensating for the screw up.  Thought's, Concern's, Gripes?  Fire away 




 His book, "West by West" was a fun read.  Gives insight about his competitiveness and how he handled it.   




 And that's part of my issue with all this.  In my opinion, it's borderline disrespectful.  How so?  You got Kap busting his tail everyday, trying to do all he can in his power to carry the team to the Super Bowl.  

And then you have a post about how happy some fans are that Alex Smith got a contract extension.  With the season starting in less than 4 hours, all focus should be on this team now, and how we're going to try and win another trophy.  Not a discussion on a QB that's no longer on a team that put up mediocre #'s.   




 Well if people stop posting of players not currently on the roster, then we can move on.  Of course there's a divide, and some fans still insist Alex was such a great player.  However all these Alex posts contribute nothing but debates and a big circle jerk.   




 Plus fuck ESPN 




 Anthony Randolph had all the makings of a super star.  Silly me when GS drafted him.  I think I even told one of buddies he's like KG but with handles and a jump shot 




 Impressed that the MMA kid fought while wearing his jacket 




 What are people's thoughts on lobster rolls that exclusively use claw meat only? I notice some places use various assortments, claw, tail, knuckly.  Tail meat IMO is the best.  I notice some Red Hook is claw and knuckle only 




 Thanks pal 




 This trumps Fette Sau?   




 Do you happen to know where your friend picked up that yakitori grill?   




 It was tasty, and if you've ever had Japanese Italian, the flavors were pretty spot on.  The cheese went really well with the noodles, and the sauce wasn't too tart either.  It wasn't heavy either 














 Or coming back from behind in Atlanta.   




 Exactly the right term, dink and dunk.  He can't complete a 20 yard out pattern to his WRs.  Either he gets too spooked in the pocket and does a check down, or doesnt have faith in his arm 




 This stuff goes well with grilled chicken 




 The post season really showed just how ineffective Lee was at times.  Granted bogut was out, but Lee looked absolutely spooked.  

Each round in the playoffs gets more intense, and there's just no way lee could handle the likes of Duncan, Ibaka, etc.   




 I like marinating in sesame oil, scallion, Lotta salt, garlic and soy sauce.  Grill it high to get the outside charred and the turn to low.    




 I've always enjoyed this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddwrxgikTsI) 




 I still remember vividly the night of 9/11.  Friends and I were smoking a blunt outside looking up a the sky.  All of a sudden we saw  2 F-14 fighter jets hovering over the SF bay.  

You could barely see their outline, but could tell by the sound and the lights surrounding the plane.  It was unreal thinking no other planes were allowed in the sky other than them.   




 Ever try soaking corn in water for about 30 min to a hour?  Highly recommend 




 When Scarlett Johansson nude shots were leaked, never seen so many redditors be kind to each other  




 Klay needs to take a good hard look at what's around him and then decide what he needs to do.  He keeps saying he would like to play for GS, he's gonna need to take a discount in order to keep other players.  If money is the deciding factor, then he's better off somewhere else.  I.E. Ducan and Novitzki taking pay cuts in order to keep the team together 









 Funny how people balk on the idea of B Davis, but would consider signing Basemore in a heart beat.  A washed up Baron is still way more valuable than a back up cheerleader 














 Because he's anti-49er, and as a commentator he should be neutral.  His voice is also monotone 




 The guy sleeping might have slept horizontally on the subway seat which is a automatic fine in NYC subways.  It's a shit rule, but I've seen many people get tagged because of this.  This is the only thing I could think of as to why NYPD would harass him 




 No thanks, we need all bench room possible.  I would rather take the time to develop Nedo and another back up PG/SG than use it on Base.   




 The ones in Japan are insane. Induction heating, ceramic bowls are just a few of the perks.  Im too embarrassed to say how much we dropped on ours 




 Golden state please step up to the mic 




 Curry, Klay, Iguodola, Lebron, Bogut would be filthy.  




 Pft is satire journalism 




 You're talon me 




 Feel like this is Spoelstra taking the fall and sticking up for his franchise player.  What else can he really say?  "Oh Lebron is a wuss, I'm disappointed" 




 Ugh...didn't V.D learn the first time, it's all about the team?   




 More than just a extension.  It's a statement to the rest of the league.  Were betting the house this year or next year 




 Damn her Twitter is just as [bad](https://twitter.com/JanelleAmbrosia) 




 My own take on this, and from what I observed living in not so great areas, i.e West Oakland and Riverside County.  When it gets hot, people like to drink more, that's a given.  

I noticed the liquor stores got busier, and the prices of 40 oz's dropped a little.  It's a cycle that doesn't stop.  People get drunk, sometimes get more irritable bc of the heat, drink more because their irritable, etc.  

Then you mix that with violence, and with school being out kids being bored, and it's a perfect recipe for crime.  I have no stats on this, just personal observation, but it's a theme that occurs every summer.  And chances are, the hotter it gets, more violence.   




 Looks awesome.  For tender asparagus, try peeling the bottom half of the stems.  Theres so much fiber around there it gets tough and chewy  




 NY'er here.  In the summertime, bras are practically non existent since it's so f'n muggy.  Another great reason to people watch in the summer =)

 There was a post a few years back where a guy was on a subway in NYC and claimed some homeless guy passed him a note with secret code.  Ended up being a huge marketing campaign for his start up 




 Tupac did Machiavelli.  Name another artist that could even come close to what he did.  How much more complex do you want from a artist? Btw, People Under the Stairs has cool flows, but complex would be a reach.   




 You're reaching with these points.  These guys are pros, and if you think a TV commentator is a distraction during practice, then they shouldn't be playing during crunch time in a playoff game 




 Perfect, just what Reddit needs.
More idiotic and ignorant posts 




 where on this post was it noted that I didn't credit the F.O?  With all these moves being made, and the F.O trying to win a championship, if these moves end up being disastrous, who gets the blame?  That was the message of this post 

You can claim we had the best starting line up, which is arguable.  I don't think we do, nor do we have a championship roster at this moment.  

As for "Cry Monta" Is that supposed to mean something?   




 With GS being in the news spotlight and all, we are now under more scrutiny than ever before.  One thing I'm curious about is the "blame game"  that might happen if we don't win, or exceed expectations.  

For instance, we had a bad bench and blame can be put on Myers and company for providing Mjax with such a shitty 2nd group.  I will give Myers some credit for the trade of Steve Blake.  However, we went into the season with Toney Douglas as the back up PG.  Did he really think that was going to work?  

So the question is, at what point is it more a personnel issue (meaning players and how they're utilized) and a coach issue?  I'm expecting us to make major roster moves this summer, and if the trade doesn't work in our favor, who gets the blame?  I guess my point is, how many freebies does Myers and West get?  Is Lacob so blinded and so awe struck by his F.O that he won't hold them accountable?   




 Don't forget the 5 man substitution patterns 




 As credible as Yahoo's Woj is, this one seems far fetched.  Why would Warriors personnel reveal something like that to media?  It would work against their favor, and we've typically been very quiet to reporters

Edit- Nevermind, SVG wanted full Baksetball Operations as well.  No Dice there 




 That article was border line awful.  -"According to non-management sources"  WTF does that even mean?

 If SVG can get Harrison Barnes to do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21cE2aUbWB0), I'm all in! 




 He called out Draymond Green in the playoffs last year, also called out Iggy.  You really want to consider him a coach, let alone piss off the players even more when they hear Karl could be a candidate?  No thanks  




 This F.O's message is to win now, not later.  I'm fine with that, and that message has been consistent throughout it all.  I want to see the same high standard held to the players, I.E Klay accountable for his poor shot selection, Steph with multiple turn overs, Lee and his lack of defense.  

I guess what I'm saying is that if the F.O is this serious, expect some major moves this summer to push the chips all in.
