 Yep, that sounds like exactly what I do, thank you!  It was a coping mechanism originally from my childhood that just never left.  It is sad at times, I do get attached to characters and end up feeling even more lonely when reality hits me.  I'd like to be able to learn to live in reality but it seems so impossible  ): 




 *Dysfunctional high five!*  Lol hi there.  It somehow makes me feel better that there is somebody else experiencing this.  Sometimes I get way too centric in my own world haha 




 I do have regrets of having given up on so many things, I just don't even know how to stick with something at this point.  Art is pretty much the only thing I ever keep in my life, but I frequently give up on those projects and such because of apathy.  I'd rather have learned to play the piano, something more exciting like that could probably keep my attention?  I dunno haha.  Most of my imagination is filled with what ifs and with a me that is much stronger than my actual self..
