 My point is that she's a glorious looking woman - look at those cheekbones!  This is an unflattering picture of her.  [This one is better](https://i.imgur.com/e80TKjb.jpg) 



















 I open your mother in one tab and your sister in another tab 




 Voat rhymes with Gloat and smells like my Boat 




 ooooooo INFOLIARS.COM must be real! 









 What an unflattering picture of her 




 Lol and consider what the TSA calls a "weapon", that means I have literally thousands (I'm a surgeon) 




 1.  the game is physically slow.  It could be a hardware issue.  Are there ways to tweak the settings so it's not so graphically intense outside of the game settings (I've reduced all of those to minimum).

2.  any idea how to do that?

3.  how do I turn on the default controls? 




 Isn't it time for the voatards to just leave? 









 Just downloaded and installed Witcher 3 for PC.  

Some problems:

1.  it's slow - any way to speed up the action (witcher runs in slow mo, etc)

2.  mouse is really sensitive, even on the lowest setting it spins witcher around if I'm not careful

3.  key bindings say "none" - do I have to set key bindings on everything or is there a default setting?

Thanks!

 Shouldn't you guys be putting all this energy into something positive like forcing the government to reduce its nuclear stockpile? 




 VPN 




 There's a couple camps off Rte 2 in Rowe that are nice 






















































 You mean my fedora LOL 




 Maybe that's why the US and Russia have over 20,000 nuclear warheads each...to nuke the asteroids that are coming 




 I use it because I can right click an image and it will rehost the image, which makes it easy to share on twitter or Reddit 




 Maybe so, but it's been reported on by multiple sites...I suppose they are all hoaxes also:

 Once reddit shakes off the former Diggers, it will return to normal 









 Just commenting.  No objective 



















 You think this is hard?  LOL 
























 The author obviously is not a redditor.  /r/conspiratard is a joke subreddit meant to poke fun at /r/conspiracy and other conspiracy subreddits.  it's not to be taken seriously. 














 The population is going down across the board, and teens are not looking for jobs (recent NY Times article).  76,000,000 Americans are either retiring soon (including myself), or are already retired (the Baby Boomers).  Where's the incentive to have children now?  America's birth rate is the lowest it's ever been, 12.7 per 1,000 people in 2013.  

We're not having babies and we're dying off.  Millennials and teenagers are not looking for work.

I suspect that many of these old jobs will disappear as people resign from them 




 Oh, so what you're saying is they don't have a legitimate beef with Leviticus?  If that were correct, that what's all this BS about gay marriage being a sin? 




 I agree with you, but I just can't imagine the hippy-freaks from the Green party joining up with the gun toting freedom 'tards of the Libertarian Party  














 If Reddit sold more advertising, I would suspect it of being clickbait 




 who 




 I think their god has left the building 




 So what.  No point in getting your jammies in a bunch because I'm practicing safe internet and others are not.  It's a matter of personal choice. 




 Good point.  If they are all god fearing Christians...I wonder about other things Leviticus has outlawed and what they've quit because of them:  

1  Burning any yeast or honey in offerings to God

2  Failing to include salt in offerings to God

3  Eating fat

4  Eating blood

5  Failing to testify against any wrongdoing youve witnessed 

6  Failing to testify against any wrongdoing youve been told about 

7  Touching an unclean animal

8  Carelessly making an oath

9  Deceiving a neighbour about something trusted to them

etc 




 And it's all good :) 




 Wikileaks may be a limited hangout, it certainly is suspicious.  I won't go near it with a 10' pole

#1 - we've already outsourced most of our jobs to Mexico, China and India.  Nothing new here

#2 - copyright is already a thing.  you will be fined if you sell something that's copyrighted without permission, you may even go to jail.

#3 - admittedly this may be bad, but inspections in the US have been bad for over 30 years.  In my state alone, there is only 1 inspector for over 1,000 funeral homes and veterinarian hospitals...some of these places haven't been inspected in 10-15 years.  

#4 - as a medical doctor in a busy ER, we are already seeing how much control pharmacy companies have over the hospital.  It can't get worse than it already is (bad)

#5 - from the language of the article, it is not clear whether or not environmental protections are indeed affected by this.   




 [BS](https://i.imgur.com/LR758Vh.gif)  This is not evidence, it is speculation and it's very thin 




 Where's your evidence of this?

This ruling has been coming for a few years.   









 Just go and sit in the back...get a feel for the room and during a break ask questions if you feel up to it.  Bring something to record the jam (smartphone will do), and have fun.  if someone offers you a chance to solo, don't try to rock out - just do flatruns if you want, they are easy and conservative and sound pretty good...later, when you've had more experience, you can rock out on solos. 




 Because the bird is still living 




 I suppose it's the right thing to do to leave if you can't do the work for some reason. 




 Once I switched over permanently to DDG, I noticed there are a bunch of blog sites that automatically share these 'tard articles: Above Top Secret, Godlike Productions, Democratic Underground, Natural News, Infowars, Veterans Today....it's like they are a hive mind and share this stuff around hoping something or someone will pick it up and think it's legit 




 I agree with you on that.  I use Bing for video search because youtube is not the default in Bing, which is great.  A lot of musicians I like won't use Youtube for various reasons, so I can find them more easily on Bing 




 You're right.  Most people are still using Internet Explorer.  Over 60,000,000 Americans still use AOL 




 Medical purposes?  Robots?  This whole sex robot thing is actually a thing... 




 They can be made by humans, and they have been made, but they are also still made by seemingly random events or weather - in seconds, not hours - with unexplained conditions (flattening of stems without crushing or snapping, for example). 




 This supreme court decision to make same sex marriage legal in all states is the greatest step forward for atheism we've had in 100 years 




 ajw.asahi.com is a Japanese website in English.  Not sure why it would crash your site unless you're blocked  









 I have location settings turned off.  I don't want Google building an index of things I search for in my locations 




 Exactly.  I will also.  For example: Pizza, Amherst 




 I wish they had a better Android App...I'd use it 




 I've used DDG for several years now.  My wife uses Chrome with Google as the default search.  Every once in a while when I pick up her laptop to look up something quickly, I'm amazed at the junk and the bloat that Google will load on the first page!   














 Dude who wrote this has no idea how reddit works.  Conspiratard is a joke subreddit, created for mocking this one and others.   




 I'm still waiting for the EMP that was supposed to happen in Texas almost a month agao 




 Watch it again 




 I'm sure you're right.  Testosterone and cocaine don't mix! 




 Flowers 




  ZetaTalk

"we, the Zetas" lol that's some fanciful nonsense 


































 I came to Reddit about 8 years ago from Fark.com  There were only a few hundred people using it at the time.  It was a great community.  I remember when people started comparing it to Digg...that was a huge kerfuffle when that all happened...and a bunch of top Digg submitters created subreddits here and became bigwigs again and the controversy and the naysayers and the whiners... this is just another "thing" and those people who are upset most by it will leave as they did during the last two or three "things" that have blown up on Reddit in recent years.

Meanwhile, I'll stay here, enjoying the site as I did 8 years ago. 




 Hey OP, don't come back! 




 DDG doesn't have as many relevant searches as Google for things such as videos and images, but it is a much better search engine for delivering relevant results without all the claptrap and bloat Google wants you to see 




 I hope these dissenters leave Reddit, and soon.  I suspect they all came after Digg died.  They have short attention spans and will go wherever the latest trend takes them 




 I'm glad.  I hope they all leave and soon.  Then we can get back to enjoying it as it was intended 



















 Did you see that rant from McCain this week?  He's pissed that we're still buying rockets from Russia.  Well, sir, maybe you should have ensured the NASA budget passed each year? 




 That one cop talked about a bad odor inside, not a sewage odor, but something smelly. 















































































 3 "doctors" in quotes. 














 aww...that's really nice of you :)

See?  This is the kind of comment that makes friends, not like your bullshit, icecreammachine 




 Voat smells like goat and rhymes with boat 




 eat me you piece of shit.  I've reported you (not that it matters at this point with all the bullshit going on around here).  But you're now on my shit list 




 Due to the number of trolls that have followed me over here from /r/Korea, I have to limit the number of approved submitters for a time.

If you would like to be an approved submitter, please PM me! 




 Who buys reddit gold?  I"ve never bought it and never will.  By the way, I've used adblock since the 1990s 





























 OP, you're out of the loop 














 Very true.  But it's a nice gesture :) 





























 Actually, I was drafted as a medic during the Vitenam war.  Best OJT there is 









 No 




 Calling this person a doctor would be like calling my plumber a surgeon 




 Where are the fucking aliens, Wikileaks?  That's what we care about! 




 Not that covert if this moron knows about them 




 I haven't watched tv since 1998  




 I'm a doctor with an MD from an accredited medical school.

These are "doctors" 




 It always amazes me that people really talk like that, they're not fooling around.

When I was a medic in Saigon, one of my nurses had an accent so thick you'd have to squint to hear English there somewhere 




 you mean "InfoLiars.com"?  yeah   




 Exactly!  Where's the EMP?  Fema coffins?  Death camps?  Death panels?  Fear Theater 




 Try or don't try.  I don't care either way 




 Foreigners?  MERS is directly affecting the native population.  There have been zero instances of foreigners with the disease 









 over the last 9 years of being a member here (obviously this is not my original account), I've had hundreds of front page posts.

you can't take it to the bank

nobody IRL cares 




 We lived near the Army base because they provided a discounted rent system (this was over 20 years ago)...later, we moved closer to my sister-in-law in Seocho-gu because my wife wanted to be near family. 




 I thought it was going to be at Hampshire? 









 Still waiting for your EMP that never happened.  When are you textards going to realize jade helm is what the govt says it is, a training exercise? 




 Here's the OP's original text

The original thread where this all started: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/345ssr/rconspiracy_new_queue_moments_ago_notice_anything/cqriaap

The more recent thread where it was discussed: http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bf43o/the_modtalkleaks_continue_major_moderators_caught/

If you dont want to sift through the above threads, the TL;DR is this: He got caught using alts to upvote and agree with himself as well as creating SRD threads to discredit the sub. Despite the indisputable truth, Flytape bullied the other mods into removing his ban, thus calling into question his own motives for allowing someone who clearly works to discredit a sub that "he cares about" to continue to shit up everything he posts on. Now they are both lying to cover up the trail.

Blacksunalchemy has now deleted those accounts even though there are artifacts of them still around (such as the redditfun link you can find in the thread). At the time of the instance, I sent several mods the info and they all agreed that he was, in fact, clearly engaging in this behavior, but Flytape continues to bully them and protect his "buddy".

He is now back on a new alt, GorgleGoo, and started gaming the sub to try and establish credibility by posting in his own thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bmwac/cops_livid_over_proposed_police_reform_measures/csnno6v

Fortunately other users noticed this strange behavior and called him out on another thread he derailed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bmqbt/pentagon_changes_laws_of_war_to_declare/

He follows the same MO every time: 1) Disrupt and derail the conversation with garbage. 2) When this is pointed out, claim to be an honest arbiter for the truth. 3) If that fails, then claim that you are an innocent victim of these baseless attacks!

One thing that I noticed and found extremely curious is that, on his new alt, he used an acronym that I only remember seeing one other place: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bmqbt/pentagon_changes_laws_of_war_to_declare/csoaxzk

I consider myself a CT

This immediately brought to mind another user who constantly disrupts and harasses others on the sub, CT_Warlock. This would follow the naming convention that he likes of dark wizard stuff from MagicTG blacksunalchemy and nomed_yob (boy demon). 100% proof? Nope but just another coincidence that I thought should be pointed out.

Furthermore, lets also not forget that he likes to claim to be a video expert. He draws signs in photoshop for a living as he has freely admitted several times. Nothing wrong with that. This, however, does not make one an expert in video, which he claims to be in order to make the invalid argument from authority in order to debunk others. I, for instance, am a materials scientist, but I dont claim to be an expert in rocketry just because they also call themselves scientists the whole idea of that is absurd. Example of him debunking the faked ISIS videos here: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2thvuu/debunked_the_latest_isis_video_of_two_japanese/

Since we cannot count on the mods to help the situation on this subreddit, and even have to question what motivation Flytape would have for defending a user who was caught red-handed gaming the sub and posting SRD threads to discredit the sub, I think it is only prudent that the userbase be the ones to police themselves.

Great job to those in that thread who caught on quickly to his games and called him out. We need to be the change that we want to see. Keep up the good work, guys.

 I don't have time to game a system, I'm just here for the lulz 




 Finally!  

What about InfoLiars.com an Veteranstoday.com?  When are you going to ban them? 




 waste of my time 









 How can sharing articles about an outbreak that is still killing people be "fear mongering"? 









 [this is for you](https://i.imgur.com/eAfXb4c.png) 




 Hardly.  My wife's sister was at Samsung when this whole thing broke out.   









 gross.  I hate hangers, especially on a fat young person...you know they'll be wrinkly and down around her knees when she's 30 




 Me too.  That guy from vermont said he doesn't believe in a god, he's pro gun, pro choice, wants to bring jobs and manufacturing back to the states...what's his name bernie something 




 A lot of shops sell Eastmans though.  For example, Gruhn's guitars, Gianna's Violins (TN), Music Emporium in Arlington, Fretted Instrument Workshop in Amherst, Ma 




 I second that.  Best instrument in that price range 




 ugh 




 That's what I'm thinking.   




 If you grew up in the hilltowns or even the countryside, I would understand your confusion, but down here in the city/urban areas (springfield/holyoke), it's a rare sight.  That's why it's interesting. 




 please post the original article with the sourced links 









 I have hundreds.  Let's start with yours, because they should be easy to produce 




 we can only hope 




 Can you link to an example, oh heck since you say they are all "heavily sourced", how about the latest top 3? 




  sighted

sighted
sdd/
adjective
(of a person) having the ability to see; not blind.
"a sighted guide is needed"
having a specified kind of sight.
suffix: -sighted
"the keen-sighted watcher may catch a glimpse" 









 The way I figure it, if they are hawking water filters, prepper supplies, medical marijuana or a book or something, then they are doing it for the money.  Of course that filter doesn't always apply.  For example, James Corbett is selling his "inside scoop" to subscribers... 




 James Corbett / Corbett Report is top on my list

Techdirt / FastCompany / Ars Technica for inside scoop on tech

Schneier on Security for NSA / Encryption

We Are Change (although they have gotten worse over the last year or so, linking up to InfoLiars too frequently for my taste)

The Intercept

Of the MSM, I read the New York Times headlines, and other related sites, just to get a sense of what's going on.

I skim the new posts off GLP to see if anything grabs my attention (it's mostly junk, but once in a while something interesting appears).

Then just a shitload of other middle-of the road sites that are too peripheral to mention here.  I read between the lines and don't take anything too seriously...I read them to get a general "pulse" of what's happening



 




 It's a conspiracy, I tells ya! 




 I didn't post it in /r/news, I posted it in /r/massachusetts where I live.

It is interesting because there have been more reports of bear sightings not just where they are more common (like Montague for example), but in Holyoke, East Longmeadow, Northampton and Amherst.

 




 A lot of fundies here too.  Consider the posts about the rapture and related nonsense about prophesies, etc.

Also a lot of unsourced stories that are probably hoaxes and frauds.  Consider anything from Infowars, prisonplanet, alex jones to be an outright fraud; and anything from Veterans Today to be at least 40% lies (according to Veterans Today Editor, Gordon Duff).

Sure people here are less likely to believe whatever latest crap is being trundled out by the main stream media, but there's a lot of alt media crap posted here also. 




 Asians have bigger brains (they are smarter than you) and wider hips than white people
