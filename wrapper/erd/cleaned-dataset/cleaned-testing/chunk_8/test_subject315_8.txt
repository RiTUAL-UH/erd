 Thanks for helping me clarify, see the edit!  




 it's all subjective my man 




 Speyburn Braden Orach, no age date printed on this bottle of single malt scotch.

I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water. 

Color: pale yellow amber

Nose: yeasty, pear, orange, lemon, vanilla

Taste: honey, lemon, salt water taffy, cinnamon, faint sour watermelon candies

Finish: oily, oaky, spicy, and pleasantly long

This is a better Speyburn than the 10 year I reviewed before. I'm actually enjoying it very much.... and it costs only 21 bucks in Michigan. 80/100.

Now for the cheapskate's questionnaire:

1. How many bottles does it take to upgrade my beginner status? 

2. If I considered changing my titles to "A Cheapskate's Review" what is the maximum amount I should set for myself in those reviews? 

Don't worry, it's not going to keep me from periodically reviewing a pricier scotch. It's just that I see so many reviews of obscure and expensive scotch I want to give us little guys a chance. Thanks for reading!

EDIT: in question 2 by maximum amount I mean maximum amount of money in American dollars.

 Speyburn 10

Is it too soon for my next review? I burned through that last bottle of Glenfiddich pretty quick, damn that stuff was tasty. Oh well...I love scotch! Scotch, scotch, scotch, here it goes down....

I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.

Color: yellow like a Cheerios box

Nose: apricot, green grapes, bubblegum, clover

Taste: woody, slighty smoky, dried banana, cranberry

Finish: watery, with a spicy burn, doesn't stay with you very long

This is a good single malt for the price (33 bucks in Michigan). It's not very complex. Not bad scotch by any means... but I'm not too excited about it.  68/100

See you next bottle!   









 Because you're not doing it right. Don't discourage this.  




 So... much... goose shit. Nothing ruins a good day more than stepping in goose shit.

 As a 30 year old man, this still made me smile. 




 No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no noooooooo. Please don't make this show. I love you, Netflix, but I will not stand idly by while you rape my childhood. Can we just have another season of Orange is the New Black instead? 




 "Feed" by M.T. Anderson 




 Thanks everybody for your nice comments!  




 Glenfiddich 12 yr

Got my paycheck, time for another review!

I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.

Color: faint orange like the stripes on a tabby cat

Nose: lime, butterscotch, nutmeg, caramel, roasted almonds

Taste: the box ain't lying when they say fresh pear, cinnamon, faint hint of mint and honey

Finish: oily, a little fire like I just finished eating a red hot candy

Overall this is the best scotch I've had so far (remember, I am a beginner!) and I can see myself buying more bottles of this in the future. I enjoy the complexity that this malt has to offer for the price, 42 bucks here in Michigan. 

90/100

 Ain't no relaxing with salvia.  




 I'm being serious here, but try smoking a joint before a cram session. I graduated college with honors (cum laude) because of Ms. Mary Jane. When you're high it helps you focus while simultaneously shutting out all the exterior noises that might distract you.  




 Glenmorangie 10 yr

I bought this for 44 bucks in Michigan. It was the last of an order of gift sets that my local liquor store had in stock. It came with two very classy scotch glasses that I use pretty much exclusively now. They are shaped to concentrate the nose with a weight that feels nice in the hand. 

I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.

Color: very pale yellow

Nose: floral, butter, potpourri

Taste: pumpkin pie, sweet potatoes with marshmallow, pecans, coconut

Finish: fine notes of toffee, very smooth, doesn't stay with you too long

72/100

Perhaps I'm spoiled in my first bottle of scotch (read my first review) but there isnt much complexity here. This scotch doesn't have much personality, but I do like it. I would probably offer it to my friends that haven't tried scotch before to get them started. 

 














 Well I've never heard of waze until now. Downloaded and installed now. Clever marketing strategy. 




 Is she hot? That's all that matters. 




 I hope Brenton finally does something about his nails. Did anyone see "The Signal?" His fingernails were literally the most disturbing thing about that movie.  




 How exciting! Hey family, let's all gather in the living room tonight to watch emaciated dead bodies being shoveled into a pit with a bulldozer! It's so amazing because Hitchcock kept it sealed for 70 years! 




 lol 




 We Americans subsidize the rest of the world's pharmaceuticals.  




 Is this so hard to understand? You're not even quoting me correctly.  




 The girl in the first one has really sad eyes.  




 That's pretty much sealing the deal on your eventual break-up. Good luck trying to break that lease.  




 
I've always hated liqour, but I'm 30 years old now and I thought that it was about time to find a liquor I enjoy. After watching youtube videos for a while, and googling the hell out of the subject, I've decided to become a scotch drinker. Here is my first review.

The Black Grouse

I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature,  with a dash of water.

Color: amber, like leaves in early fall

Nose: under-ripe oranges, lemon, hint of vanilla, maple syrup

Taste: smoke, sugar, burnt caramel

Finish: very dark chocolate, woody

As a beginner, I actually enjoyed this scotch very much. The price is right, too. Paid 26 dollars for this in Michigan. 78/100. 

My next review I'll post with when I get my next paycheck. I'm going to try Glenmorangie 10 year. I love scotch! 



 









 This is not the Enterprise. The Enterprise was built in space and she stays in space. That is why JJ's Star Trek 2 is stupid.  









 Frisson is that tingly feeling you get in your spine when you witness something really exciting or emotional. Google it. 

For me it would have to be the killing of Hexxus at the end of "FernGully." 




 you pile stupidity upon stupidity, kid. Just stop.  




 There is actually no difference between turtle and tortoise. Do some research, jackass. 




 We're we all reading the same book? Yeah, it's a horror novel but it still will always be more of an epic fantasy novel in my mind. I think we need a decent adaptation of "The Talisman" instead. 




 Is anyone else bothered by all the Nazi/Hitler posts in this sub? It seems like I'm coming across at least one a day. Why the fuck should we care or want to learn about these monsters?  









 Well I guess pigs can fly... time to go do that thing.  




 yeah but she is super ugly and kinda looks like Skeletor so no

 I understand that hipsters like you enjoy old-timey shit, but this is just ridiculous. It's not cool to make yourself bleed now, then, or in the future. You're a fucking dumbass.

 You're either fat, depressed, ugly, stinky, or have social anxiety. Lose weight and/or see a shrink and/or get plastic surgery and/or wear deodorant and/or smoke more weed. You say you'll be rich? Don't worry... you'll be able to buy friends and/or hookers when that happens.
