 It's not about how I look or how I think I'll be perceived, it's just some irrational thing I don't really understand. 




 C'mon, it'll be fun! Who knows where we'll end up? 




 I sometimes meet my friends' kids who I last saw when they were 4 or younger. I try not to say much about them in those days because I know they'll feel awkward. 




 This. No color appears. 




 Asking people I don't know for things -- even salesclerks, coworkers in other departments, people whose jobs involve helping me out. 




 Had this happen recently. I hadn't seen this person since I was about 12, we're talking decades, and I also forgot how she knew us (her mother and my mother were ~~college~~longtime friends; I could have asked beforehand but I had the derp). It took me a while to get caught up; I hope I didn't give anything away. We got together for dinner next time she was in town, so it's nice to be caught up.

 Agree on the interior space; it's amazing how not having a back seat makes the interior so much more efficient.

Disagree on the acceleration, though; the Smarts I've driven (I lived in a car2go city) have all been slow on the uptake. But apart from that they're a ton of fun, and soo easy to park. Now I live in a big city and wonder why there aren't a ton more of them.

 Consonance too. 




 In some militaries the words have different meanings; a marksman has greater skill or training than the average soldier and has a specialized role in an infantry, but a sniper is even more specialized. I'd say casual usage reflects the same distinction, a "marksman" is a good shot but is not necessarily a sniper.

 I grew up in the city where the BTK murders were happening, while they were happening. It was years before they caught the guy.

Later I moved to another city and a shopkeeper near my apartment tortured and killed six men over several years. He was caught when the seventh man escaped from his basement and went to a neighbor for help wearing only a dog collar. 




 A writer and an editor are lost in the desert, and just as they're about to give up hope they see an oasis. They stagger up to the pond and the writer puts his face in the water to take a long drink. When he comes up for air he sees the editor peeing into the pond. "Hey, what are you doing?" the writer yells. The editor replies, "I'm making it better!" 




 You picked a fine time to leave me, loose seal.

 Miranda Rights come from a 1966 Supreme Court ruling. *Dirty Harry* was released in 1971, so Harry would have gone through police academy and possibly already made detective before the SFPD started using them. So it's no surprise he didn't quite know how they worked. 




 I had to look to be sure I didn't write this post because it's so familiar. I was getting out of bed OK, but actually writing wasn't happening for me either. 

I'll say this: If you take step a) and drop out, you may find the depression lifts because the degree obligations aren't hanging over your head. Shortly after I left, people told me I looked much more relaxed. Felt that way too.  




 Interesting. I'd have thought the extra few years of learning research would be more valued, sort of treating the PhD programs like farm systems in baseball (free training!). But I don't know as much about STEM as I'd like. 




 Noted; most of my knowledge is in social sciences. In my field (journalism/media studies) there are some journals where publication doesn't help you much -- one prof at my school was denied tenure in part, so we heard, because he was publishing in the wrong places. Some journals are actually scams, but there are so many people looking for the lines on the CV that they rope some of them in. 




 Yeah, the general rule is you don't pay for your own doctorate. Not worth it. 




 TT = Tenure track; professors want tenure because it's job security. If you're not on the track your fate is out of your hands.

I don't know your situation well enough to offer advice, but when I got out of undergrad I had a crap job for a year and realized I was better off going back. It clarified things considerably. 




 Maybe they have looked at the job market and decided you'll have the best shot at a TT job if you have at least 3 publications, so they make it a requirement. That would be a rational approach to the current situation. 




 What's odd about grad school is that you can find out when you're still partway through that it's not working out, but pushing through can seem like a less-bad option than dropping out. There's some sunk-cost fallacy going on there, though that's not all there is to it. But once you're in that situation your life can seem aimless. 




 Agreed.  




 When I say "the system is heavily biased" that's probably right. In most fields there's a quite reasonable assumption that if you enter the a PhD program you're looking for an institutional teaching or research career, since that's what they're there to prepare people for, and going a different route takes extra effort. 




 I don't know that there's one root, unless it's the slowness of the institution to adapt to external changes. Administration is part of it.

And PhDs have more options, and I mentioned some resources in another comment. But the system is heavily biased toward steering them into teaching jobs outside STEM and to a great extent within it. 




 Maybe, maybe not; you should be *learning* to generate publication-quality research. Most dissertations generate publications after graduation, not before, in part because the student is busy finishing the damn thing and doesn't have time to write up articles. (Dissertations themselves are a highly constrained format not suitable for publication as is. Everyone I know who eventually turned theirs into a book spent at least a year on the rewrite.) 




 Oh, that's exactly the real issue. There's a finite amount of time that the academic community can devote to peer reviewing articles and editing journals, and diminishing returns on quality set in long before the demand for publication space is close to satisfied. 




 What /u/brilliantjoe said, plus many universities are cutting costs by hiring adjuncts (lecturers, instructors, "visiting" profs) instead of actual professors, or alternatively ditching adjuncts and making the profs take on more or larger classes. Either way it means there's a shrinking supply of decent jobs in the field. 




 At least one-third of your colleagues feel the same way, possibly more. People just don't feel safe talking about it so they keep it to themselves.  




 Three publications as a degree condition is highly unusual IME. I could have graduated with no papers, and my colleagues in other disciplines had at most 1 publication required. 

Requiring so many publications is a rotten idea also because it increases the demand for places to publish, and tons of journals spring up, many of which are crap. That makes it harder to find the worthwhile research in the sea of mediocre-to-bad articles. 




 Been there. Excellent advice, and there's more in the comments over there too. 




 I'll second especially what /u/RedBugs said and others. I left my program after 7 years when my diss proposal wasn't accepted. I'd been at it too long to have come up with so little, so there was no point in continuing. Fortunately I had been applying for non-academic jobs just in case, partly because I wasn't sure I wanted to be a professor anyway. Two days after my proposal died I had my first job interview, and I got hired and started work within a few weeks. The pay isn't quite what I'd hoped, and I'll be dealing with student loans for a while, but as I look back I realize I'm doing work I like in the city where I've always wanted to live, and I doubt that would have happened so quickly if I'd gotten the degree. 

I'm already making more contacts in my non-academic field, and things are looking fairly bright from here. 

Oh, a word about grief and shame: They are both natural in your situation, and they suck, but you don't need to feel bad *about* having those feelings. It's like breaking up with your SO after 8 years. You'll feel a deep sense of loss for a while, then eventually things will get better. Not today, probably not tomorrow, but not too long from now.

One more thing: check with your school to see if they provide access to the services at [Versatile PhD](http://versatilephd.com/); their rasion d'etre is helping academics, both PhDs and ABDs, to find good careers in the "real world." You can pay for your own subscription if need be, and it may be worth it to you. I was lucky to get a job before I needed their services much, but I'm pretty impressed with their resources. 




 Been there. For some of us there's just some mental block about actually Getting It Done that we can't go around. I've heard it called Dissertation Paralysis. I talked a psychologist at my school into starting a support group for just that sort of thing, and (irony of ironies) it didn't get me over the hump, but a couple of other people in the group said they probably wouldn't have finished without it. 

One difficulty we face as PhD students is that "diss paralysis" is never talked about; either you're making progress or you're not, and the professors (who all *did* succeed so they may not "get it") have a limited set of ways to deal with it. I'm hoping that that support group, which is still up and running (and spawned at least one offshoot writing group), will lead to more openness and support in that area.

Once I recognized the diss paralysis problem for what it is I started talking it up at academic conferences. Some people seemed interested in learning more, because they do want to help the students finish and graduate, but it's still a ways from being seen as a normal thing that happens to many of us. 




 What's in your cart can suggest whether you're not married (lots of single-serving items, say). It slightly raises the odds above random chance that whoever we're approaching won't be already partnered up. And for some guys, any edge in the odds is enough. 




 My closest encounter was shopping at an antique/oddity stall called Bob's Bazaar Bizarre in the Westport Flea Market in Kansas City. The proprietor was Bob Berdella, who was later imprisoned for torturing and killing six male prostitutes over the course of four years. I don't remember much about him. 




 I suspect that most successful TV shows succeed because they create characters the audience can care about and relate to, so when they get into a not-too-original situation each episode it's still new-ish because we see how *these* characters respond. Sci-fi can make such characters, but since each episode "has" to have SF elements there's less opportunity to develop the characters or to put them in situations where they don't end up phase-blasting their way out. It can be done, but it's not easy.

BSG succeeded in part because early on it put a LOT of resources into world-building so that the writers could plausibly replicate just about any dramatic situation. "Labor strife, but in space." "Ethnic discrimination, but in space." "Rigged elections, but in space." They had much more range and didn't need as many old tropes as other series. 




 In particular, it's usually Nike athletic shorts and a T-shirt, and usually in a combination that suggest the person dressed in the dark or is color-blind.

What also gets me is that the "official" T-shirts that people wear to the games and so forth are either burnt orange or ... hot pink. And groups of people on game days wear both. It's hideous. (I like burnt orange when it's paired with colors it works with, which unfortunately are few.)

 From my time in academia, I'd say that the farther you progress, the more you know about a narrower range of subjects as you specialize more and more. So you learn a lot, but it's an inch wide and a mile deep, and so you feel as if you're dumb about everything else. 




 He's just having a catnap. 




 My history teacher in high school had a twin who taught at a different school in town, and she said they sometimes taught each other's classes. I have no idea if they did it while I was in their class, since they never gave it away while it was happening. 




 Second PCL. I always bring a jacket or sweatshirt. 




 If they wanted to promote a professional atmosphere, they'd either post the *entire* code or just say "follow the freakin' dress code, people." What they actually did is cherry-pick the code (which is not on UT's website anywhere) specifically to single out women as the cause of whatever problem it is they are claiming to solve.  




 UT acknowledged it, and said it was "poorly worded" and that it would be taken down.  




 I'm told there's also a pig about town named Peter Porker. He goes for walks on the LBL trail now and again. 




 I think that number is wrong, or at least misleading. Wikipedia says the entire TAMU system has 28K faculty and staff. To get to 50K you probably have to count graduate assistants, adjuncts, and part-time student workers.
