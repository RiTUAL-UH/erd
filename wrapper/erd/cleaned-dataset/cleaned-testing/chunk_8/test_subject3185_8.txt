The secrecy of letters and correspondence is derived through litigation from the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an 1877 case the U.S. Supreme Court stated:

 No law of Congress can place in the hands of officials connected with the Postal Service any authority to invade the secrecy of letters and such sealed packages in the mail; and all regulations adopted as to mail matter of this kind must be in subordination to the great principle embodied in the fourth amendment of the Constitution. 

The protection of the Fourth Amendment has been extended beyond the home in other instances. A protection similar to that of correspondence has even been argued to extend to the contents of trash cans outside one's house, although unsuccessfully. Like all rights derived through litigation, the secrecy of correspondence is subject to interpretations. By Supreme Court precedent, rights derived from the Fourth Amendment are limited by the legal test of a "reasonable expectation of privacy". 




 What if britain withdraws from the European Court of human rights?  This is exactly what the Tories are talking.

You see your entire copypasta argument supporting guaranteed rights instantly falls apart.


In the US, the Bill of Rights is seen as a sacred text, with any violation intolerable. 

Also compare this to the UK government where the will legally justify mass surveillance

So I'm certainly not the idiot here.  Top tip. Don't use copy pasta.

 I think the citizens take it seriously and slowly those rights becomes an election issue.  The current government might not care until then.

 I believe that virtually every single one of our international dank memes was invented or codified by the people of Chennai.

 Stopping these sneaky moves is important and necessary. But it's like bailing water out of a leaky boat. To plug the leak, reduce the influence of money in politics. 




 While your OP   is certainly aired in jest, I honestly believe we are in the midst of history in the making. While trying to avoid buying into hype and grandeur, let me elaborate a moment.

We've all read some writings from Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton (this guy is a true hero), Ben Franklin, Thomas Paine, John Adams (no less a hero, ironically HATED Hamilton), etc on these very topics. Similar was their plight and equal was their discontent, though it would inevitably grow much stronger nearer the Revolution itself. Their established, respected government encroached upon their fundamental rights. It was nothing new then, it's nothing new now.

Having watched the video, I am unable to separate them it from those letters and well known quotables from patriots long gone. Granted, no one is asking for revolution, at least, no one of any sense. But the fact remains that one day these silly little sketches from from a silly show finding their way to a website like may find their way into the textbooks text-tablets of our grandchildren. Will they speak of an evil, failed coup to cripple the Government's (No doubt by then the word will carry a capital G while the word "god" will not) enforcement of the law? Or will they be the words of activists who fought for human rights against an overreaching body? 

For all of our sakes, for our children's sakes, I sincerely hope it is the latter. May changes to policy, and more importantly, the world's attitude towards these issues, come swiftly and peacefully.

Let me pre-empt the critics.  Yes  some are reluctant to compare Snowden to the likes of Jefferson and Franklin. Please do not misunderstand. I know it's a big jump, but I don't see it as immediately inappropriate. Americans hold certain historical figures up high as a manner of culture. They deserve our respect and gratitude, but in truth they were humans who spoke up in their times. They were farmers, business men, lawyers. Both sets (activists then and now) committed treason in the name of human rights, and that is to be respected.

Now, we do not need a new bill with his face on it or anything. My position is simply that these events and issues will undoubtedly be marked in history, and that Snowden has had no small part in it.   #NSALookAtMyDick may well be an important chapter and history in the making.

 The trouble I find with that system is that it invites exceptions and conflicts

e.g. data protection act versus anti-terror legislation.

The American system isn't great but its simplicity seems better equipped for people to point to fundamental higher rights when making arguments.

Maybe a trained lawyer would have no problem describing the UK system but I get confused by it and don't find it empowering.

 This is what I'm talking about 




 [This was my sauce](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/24/gchq-nsa-surveillance-scandal).  Funny that their comment of the week is something lauding them. 




  At the top of the Pyramid and you have the Rothschilds, the British Crown and the Vatican.  You can make a noise about lizard people to distract and create ridicule.  However, you cannot hide back the truth which is evident in the media every day. 




 Virtually every single one of our international sports were invented or codified by the British. Ping-pong was invented on the dining tables of England in the 19th century, and it was called Wiff-waff! And there, I think, you have the difference between the British and the rest of the world. Other nations, like the French, looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to have dinner; the British saw it as an opportunity to play Wiff-waff.   So yeah you may call me 'Murican but I know why we have table tennis and why it ain't no ping pong.

Reading these responses from all 3 OPs, I am unable to separate them from those letters and well known quotables from patriots long gone. Granted, no one is asking for revolution, at least, no one of any sense. But the fact remains that one day these silly little AMA's from a silly website may find their way into the textbooks text-tablets of our grandchildren.

  The Queen has a weekly meeting alone with the Prime Minister.  You can be sure that they don't just drink tea. 




 I think the bbc must remain neutral.

If there is a message, things like games help individuals see the problem, futility and perhaps the solution for themselves 




 In the UK, the data protection act has teeth and is a hugely important for how organisations go about their business.   Not sure about exemptions but things like counter terrorist legisalation must make plenty of those for GCHQ.
https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act


 




 The Sovereigns assent is required to all bills passed by Parliament in order for them to become law.  This means that the Queen and British Crown is in ultimately in charge.  Never forget that.  England will prevail.
 




 
They are just afraid of how legislation will be used.  Look at the mess that the European court of human rights has caused and how it has crept much further than expected.

 




 The guardian is a leader on promoting the snowden leaks and disemination of information. That is *why* I mention it.

Now ask yourself - what if a country offers justice, justice in the form of a charter of liberties, allowing every man to forage for his hearth, to be safe from conviction without cause or prison without charge, to work, eat and live on the sweat of his own brow - and be as merry as he can.  That would be a free and land.  But it would require a royal decree. 




 In tyranny lies only failure. Empower every man and all will gain strength

 Everywhere else is like Britain.  It is the empire on which the sun never sets. 




 The US government is concerned with the actions of the NSA because citizens have rights expressly declared in the Constitution. The NSA has violated those rights which delegitimizes the government itself. So the situation is taken seriously.

Elsewhere like Britain, there are no guaranteed rights. The only concern for the relevant parties is reserved for trouble makers like the Guardian newspaper, who insist on keeping the citizens informed.

 On December 2nd, 2013 a man was shot in Iceland by police officers after shooting two of them with a shotgun (both officers survived).  He was not killed immediately, but died in the hospital later, because the shot was meant to subdue him, not kill him.  The Icelandic police force publicly apologized to the man's family and offered counseling to the officers involved.  

This was the **first** person to be killed due to an armed police operation in **Iceland's history**.

 Depending on country, I don't think it is a terrible thing to have these types of arrangements and a good opportunity where everyone can win.   The net neutrality argument is weak when it makes services unaffordable for the masses. 

 




 I think I will wait to see what games/apps need room space.   I keep thinking of the nintendo wii where all the good games require subtle movements and the shit games involve flailing arms around in a big space.

 Thanks for the delicious karma.   



















 Yes.  Do you understand how infrastructure investment is not necessarily well served by draconian net neutrality laws? 









 *  Net neutrality in India doest sound so good. 

*  They need content creators to invest in the infrastructure.

*  Facebook etc seem to be willing to throw a lot of money at it but not sure what regularoty changes will do for this enthuasm. 

*  Also remember how most are reliant on mobile networks. 

*  There must be a milder solution.
