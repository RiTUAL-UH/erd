 Stop downvoting /u/thatscrap. He's asking genuine questions and wants to get informed about how this works. Nothing wrong with that.  




 I'm so glad that The Ed Show is on 5:00-6:00. That's a really prime spot to have right at the end of the work day when people are getting home and it gives Bernie a lot of good exposure when Ed Schultz talks him up.   




 It's actually only been flying at the State House since 1962. In 2000, it was removed from the dome of the State House and moved to its current position next to the Confederate War Memorial.  




 The flag that was first put on top of the State House in 1962 was the Tennessee Confederate flag, which is the traditional, rectangular version we think of usually. It's well-accepted that that flag was used in defiance of the civil rights movement at the time. That flag was taken down from the State House in 2000 and the Battle Flag took it's place in front of the State House. It's only been on the grounds for about 50 years, so anyone arguing that it is a part of our state's heritage, is in denial.  




 If anyone wants to look up the current law regarding the flag, it's S.C. Code Ann. 1-10-10 (1976). The South Carolina General Assembly is only in session from the beginning of January to the end of June, just six months of the year. Hopefully the plan involves some kind of special session of the General Assembly to address the flag issue, otherwise any bill would have to wait to be considered until 2016. Unfortunately, that's just how the timing of this attack worked out. 

Edit: Based on Nikki Haley's speech, it looks like she'll invoke her executive powers to extend the legislative session to ensure that the flag removal legislation will make it to the floor and be voted on. 

Edit 2: 6 legislators from the South Carolina Black Caucus will be introducing a resolution to amend the General Assembly's agreement for adjournment to include debate on removing the Confederate flag from the State House grounds and to include debate on hate crime legislation. South Carolina currently has no hate crime statutes.
