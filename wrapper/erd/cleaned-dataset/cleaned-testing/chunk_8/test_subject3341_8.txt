 Can you link it for me? I can't seem to find it. 




 It sounds like chaos because the timing is off and the brain can't find a "groove" to settle into. Take a look at what /u/Poobslag commented above. The chord changes are jarring and seem out of time with the song.  




 Tapered is your answer. No one's calves are bigger than their thighs. 




 Standard tapered have significant'y more thigh room than slims. I went with a standard tapered because I normally can't wear slim pants (511 is a sausage-thigh fit) and I normally wear normal tapers but I definitely could have gone with a slim tapered. Think of slim as the standard, skinny as the slim, and standard as the "plus".

I will say the standard still has a nice taper to them. They won't look like dad pants.  




 Some leather conditioner might help.  




 [Navali bags](http://www.navali.com/bags/boatswain-messenger-bag.html?product=anchor639) are pretty nice. And they're on sale right now! 




 You should wear light, pastel colors. 

If you want to really go in depth, check out [this](http://www.wikihow.com/Choose-Colors-That-Flatter-Skin-Tone) guide to determining your skin tone. Once you've found it, search your skin tone + color chart to find a palate of colors that work well with your specific skin tone. 

Note that these aren't set rules! If you find a color that doesn't match your skin tone but you think still looks good on you, rock it! And what color your clothes are relative to you matters very little. What's much more important is your clothes' color relative to each other. 

As for what clothes you should wear, check out the side bar's Getting Started Guide and hang around on this sub. 

Good luck! 




 I know charcoal colored gets thrown around here a lot but I already have one of those (J. Crew University coat, which I love) and I'm looking to expand my coat selection during the coming end-of-season sales. I am looking for a light, heather gray wool coat.

I love the design and color of [this Zara](http://www.zara.com/us/en/sale/man/coats-and-trench-coats/coats/double-faced-coat-c541817p2161054.html) coat but I have heard bad things about Zara and the quality at this price point. I would rather have something that will last me a while. Is there anything with a similar design? Or should I just go for this one?

I also like the [Schott Car Coat in Heather Gray](https://www.schottnyc.com/products/wool-car-coat.htm) but my size is already sold out. 

The [J. Crew Skiff Jacket](https://www.jcrew.com/AST/Navigation/Sale/AllProducts/PRD~A9716/A9716.jsp?Nbrd=J Nloc=en_US Nrpp=48 Npge=1 Ntrm=skiff isSaleItem=true color_name=CHARCOAL isFromSearch=true isNewSearch=true hash=row0) is also nice but doesn't come in the light gray color I want.

Do you know of any coats that fit my description?  




 It's called flaring, and there isn't too much you can do about it. I'd return it if you still can. Ironing may also help.  




 All this is sound advice, but if he is unmotivated to do any of this with you, there is very little you can do to persuade him otherwise. Some people just don't care about clothing or fashion at all, and no amount of guidance or conversation will be able to change that. If you try all of this and he STILL doesn't want to do it, please don't try to force it or make ultimatums or anything like that, for the sake of your relationship. Just accept that he really doesn't care and drop the issue. 

I really hope everything works out! Good luck! 




 Don't worry about having the "normal" amount of pants. Even if you had 500 pairs, if you had a use for and are happy with owning all of them, it's okay.  




 I used to do the same thing as you when I was first starting out and buying my basic items. Now that I have a good enough wardrobe my shopping experience is a little different. There are a few items that I am looking at purchasing/upgrading to add to my wardrobe (parka, dress shoes) that I am slowly researching and taking my time on purchasing. When I go to stores I take a look at these items but also "impulse buy" anything that I like that is on sale (ie. might not be there when I come back) at stores that have good return policies. I then sit on it for a while and really consider whether I will really use an item or not. Most often I end up returning the item. If what I like is not on sale I'll add it to my list of things to research more. This gives me the "shopping fix" without wasting any money.

I view shopping as more of a journey than a destination spot. I have more than enough basics that I don't have to make trips to buy specific things anymore - instead, I shop to see new clothes that maybe aren't exactly in line with my current style or something I wouldn't necessarily think of wearing. Maybe I will be inspired to try something new. 

A total of zero of my friends care about dressing well, and they view shopping as a chore and only go when they absolutely need something, and try to be in and out as fast as possible. They make fun of me for going every week and coming back with nothing. But I don't care. To me it's an experience that helps me develop my personal style. 

Plus going by myself gets me away from my asshole friends. 

TL;DR: what you're doing is fine and better than what most people do.  




 I think the most important thing about a fragrance is whether you like it or not. If you don't like it, you won't be confident when you wear it, and confidence is everything.  




 I would save up an extra $50 or so and get a pair of Meermins.  




 Uniqlo heattech is deep enough that two buttons undone won't show. I have yet to try to airisms.  




 Stretch might not be the right word to use... A wool coat will "soften" up over time, conform to your body shape and become much more comfortable to wear after a little while. 

I definitely think there is such a thing as "breaking in" a wool coat. If the fit is fine, just give it a little time to relax and form to you.

 Honestly I think Ross's cologne prices aren't anything spectacular. You can buy the same things on Amazon for about the same/even less. 

Watch the clearance section for reasonable deals. I picked up some Calvin Klein Euphoria that I really like.  




 Perry Ellis 360 Red is the one that smells like Aqua di Gio. Personally I think Perry Ellis 360 smells absolutely disgusting. It made me so nauseous I had to wash it off. 




 It doesn't look like she's eaten anything before.  




 So soaking in vinegar does nothing? Is there anything else I can do?  




 If I don't want my new raws to get super siq faydes what should I do? I've heard a cold water, salt, and vinegar soak helps lock in more dye. I've heard woolite dark helps. 




 What size should I get if I wear 8.5s-9s? 




 I have the same problem and Uniqlo's cut was really bad for me. I have found J. Crew's slim shirts to fit very well off the rack. 




 If I don't want my new raws to get super siq faydes, what should I do? I've heard a cold water, salt, and vinegar soak helps lock in more dye. 




 As much as I hate to circle-jerk, Uniqlo's stuff fits your body type very well. Other brands that I find fit well are J. Crew and American Eagle.

 Just get both and try them on, they have free returns.  




 I just called my store and they told me they weren't doing the extra 50% off winter items and denim :( Oh well, it's still a great price! 




 Unfortunately my local store doesn't carry Unbranded :( Do you think they would still take the 50% off? 









 Looks too small and tight. It looks like an undershirt right now. 

Tanks should be a little loose and billowy. You're supposed to be letting the air flow through to keep you cool. [This](http://www.randysreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bro-tank.jpg) is how I think they should fit to look okay. Notice that the chest is not skin tight, as it is right now.  




 What is normally included in these grab bags?  




 I am looking to be an investment manager, the interview will be at Morgan Stanley. Still think it will be okay? 




 Would a dark brown perforated cap toe shoe be too casual for an interview? Should I do a non-perforated cap toe instead? 




 And free! 




 Uniq-

Oh, you said boxers, not boxer briefs. 

But still, most likely Uniqlo. 




 Also, these "mature" clothes mentioned above will look "young/fresh" if they fit well and are cut in a modern style. That way you can still look grown-up while still keeping a fresh look.

This is the game I play constantly in college.  




 I got sent another one of these codes today and noticed that it was the same one I received yesterday. I tried it and the code worked! I would try using your codes again and seeing if they reset overnight.  




 J. Crew's 770 fit is very similar. 




 Get a suede brush (or use a firm toothbrush) and brush the shoes to restore the nap. Be sure to brush in one direction, like you're brushing a pet.  




 Nice, picked up a pair of used Chippewa's for $58.18. Got lucky! 




 Warby Parker

edit: oh crap you said not expensive... yeah I have no clue. Sorry :( 




 Your hair is the perfect type to do something like that in the picture. There is about no way to get your hair to look like that without using product, at least at first, so don't worry about how your hair grows at the roots. You will be able to style it like that. 

In regards to clothes, just read the sidebar and hang around on this sub. Go thrifting and experiment with clothing. Remember, fit is king. Slowly but surely your style will develop and you will start looking the way you want to.  




 J. Crew has a similar fit with a longer body length.  




 Not a big fan of J. Crew Factory personally. I'd say Uniqlo has the edge quality-wise, but J. Crew's fits just work better for me.  




 I just called and they didn't let me :(  




 I'd check out Warby Parker, they have plenty of glasses that would match pretty well.
