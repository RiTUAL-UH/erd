 He'll just pay the fine, come back and finish the film, get paid shitloads, and respect the laws the rest of us agreed to going forward. We do love JD too, just egalitarian. If i did the same I'd get the same, not that I'd have fucken yorkshire yapyap terriers. 




 Strict quarantine laws because we don't have rabies, and have a bad history of invasive introduced species. The US has its own laws about bringing in animals. All countries do.  




 And halfway through filming latest Pirates movie.. And yea, he flew his dogs home on private jet so pretty sure he'll stump up. Equal application of law is heartening. Being able to choose between 10 years jail and being able to pay cash to not do that is really not cool.  




 True, they're cunts imo.. But then how do you feel about the rich and famous judged under a different set of rules? JD's one of my fav bros, doesn't mean he gets to do whatever. We have quarantine laws for good reason. You want me to bring all our beasties to your house?

 Worked for me using the data in the pastebin, split using Text to Columns with commas as the delimiter. 




 For the record, the reason some dates aren't changing to the "d-mmm-yy" format you have set in the date columns is because they're before 1 Jan 1900, which is where Excel starts counting dates (1/1/1900 = 1), so dates prior to that are text strings, not numbers. To change the formatting on the dates after 1/1/00, highlight the column, right click  Format Cells. On the Numbers tab in Category, select Custom. In the Type field, enter *d mmmm yyyy*.

 Again, we're talking about a lengthy period here. But in the 5th and 6th centuries trousers, traditionally worn under a short tunic or with a small cloak, were ankle length. If loose, the excess material was bunched around the waist and, as Owen-Crocker describes, hung in folds around the legs. [Owen-Crocker, Gale R., Dress in Anglo-Saxon England, revised edition, Boydell Press, 2004.](https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Dress_in_Anglo_Saxon_England.html?id=45RJYhTGZiUC hl=en)

 We cannot be sure exactly what Anglo-Saxon children would have worn, but we can make a guess based on objects found in graves, from drawings in Anglo-Saxon books and images on objects.

It appears that Anglo-Saxon children wore clothes similar to the adults. Boys would wear trousers with a tunic and a belt at the waist, like men. Girls may have just worn a long tunic dress but some girls also appear to have worn the over-dress held together with a pair of brooches at the shoulders and a belt at the waist. Children would also have worn leather shoes.

 [Tolkien on America, democracy, and 'the West'](http://threehierarchies.blogspot.com.au/2008/06/tolkien-on-europe-america-democracy-and.html) is a decent read on this.  




 That wasn't admin, just some random dude in sub. It makes good business sense for all parties -r eddit gets news, sites get traffic for tidbits. See how we go. 



















 Put it this way, if your girlfriend had a store stuffed with gold-pressed latinum that was quantum locked so you dumped her because the investment value was no longer there, then for reasons I can't fathom she removed that lock..would you not reinvest in that relationship? 




 What if they unpaywall? 




 The subreddit belongs to the subscribers. We're just the curators, keeping it real as best we can. I've submitted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/35q6qt/block_paywalled_sites_unless_they_allow_reddit/) to the admins, which could fix the issue both ways. See how we go. 




 Submitted [this suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/35q6qt/block_paywalled_sites_unless_they_allow_reddit/) to admins. It's a good idea, and reddit may well have the clout to achieve it. 




 Reddit has the clout as a major driver of news links to request this. It has precedent and would be worthwhile for the sites who allow this as one-off articles. At present they are clogging up reddit with unreadable news links. 









 If it were 'Asteroid Impact Imminent In New York' or something, I'd agree, but what is important to the sub is the content of the news, not the speed of delivery. There are plenty of non-paywalled news sources running it now. A paywalled article of import frustrates subscribers and is poor form on our part from a readability perspective. We are drafting a rule change to disallow them. 














 Our Rules were adopted in consultation with our subscribers, we don't change them lightly. Paywalls aren't an issue that comes up much, but I've initiated a mod thread to discuss. Agreed, they're a pain. There are other non-paywalled sites running the story, or you can google the title and get unpaywalled WSJ article from search links, but I'm leaving this post as it's not against current rules, and at the least will make people look it up if they want to read more. But yes, annoying. 




 Noted. We will discuss. This is a tech-relevant post, though clearly not ideal link. We currently do not have a rule against paywalls, but is an issue.

 Oh the irony.. 
























 Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State, at that time (1892) an independent Boer Republic. It became part of the Union of South Africa after the Boer War. Tolkien had little conscious memory of South Africa. His father had only taken the assignment in Bloemfontein because the English bank for which he worked had promised him a promotion for going there. Certainly Tolkien never considered himself to be a South African, just an Englishman who happened to be born in South Africa. He never returned. 




 His father was head of a British bank in Bloemfontein. They moved back to England when JRRT was 3.

 I'd think the electrons leaving so quickly leave the surface full of positively charged ions, which repel each other owing to the ions mutual electrostatic repulsion.  




 When elements are close to being stable, they would want to bond with others to drop that electron to become a compound. When elements want to bond with others so badly, it makes them more reactive. Exothermic. Also:

 I'll defer to that, adjust accordingly. I did 2009 - 2012, and the winds that truly vexed us (actually, 2009 was the only bad year to challenge the the bar structure) was a hardcore easterly. But point being, consider it with camp layout. Missing it again this year :( fair trek from oz. Burn for me.. 














 If you do do this, set it up with the opening facing west. White outs most commonly sweep through east to west, and you don't want to end up a giant dustpan. Something to lower and secure on the open side when the wind kicks up, but also the ability to loosen the walls cloth/canvas/plastic/whatever on all sides if the structure is in danger of shifting if the wind gets too crazy. You'll fill up with dust, but better than the collapse of the structure. No matter how secure it looks, you are still basically a sail, and when the wind is beyond the capability of a ship to handle, you retract them. And as stated, rebar rebar rebar!
