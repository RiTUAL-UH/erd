 Fun little Asteroids clone I made for the One Game A Month challenge. You are a spaceship pilot, sent to wipe out the hordes of Jovian GasBags infesting Jupiter's upper atmosphere. These jelly-fish like creatures float in the air, splitting apart under laser fire.

##Controls
***
Arrow keys/WASD to turn/thrust. Spacebar/Control to shoot. Press escape to pause while in game, M to mute the music, and R to restart quickly when you're on the death screen. The levels get harder and harder, and when you die your highscore is saved locally.
