 Yes, I mean the notification light. I had a Motorola Bravo before the SGS2 and really liked the notification light.

Good to know it works...I keep unlocking the phone so often, maybe I've missed the flashing :-/

Thanks! 




 Yeah I can't decide too.

I really like it in Google Now. It's a very intuitive way to deal with all the information, but outside of it...I'm not sure yet. Especially when you can't swipe them away. 









 Before, Google now, now Google play

A swipe to the left, a swipe to the right  
Nothing happens, they're stuck there tight!

 Yeah next year sounds good. Ten years later, it won't matter if I climbed Adams before Rainier or Rainier before Adams ;-)

I bought the book, thanks for the recommendation!

 I have DTExpress IV, that I've used lovingly (as lovingly as drummers can, I guess). 

Everything works perfectly. The module is still doing its job impeccably and you can upgrade all the pads and use the same module. At least, when I bought the drumkit, it was the same module across kits.

This is the kit: http://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-DTXPRESS-Special-Electronic-Drum/dp/B000YK9XB8/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top

Except for the snare pad, which is not the mesh pad as shown in the figure, but just a normal pad with three zones.

The item is no longer manufactured by Yamaha, though I believe they are still using the module in their entry level kits.

PM me if interested. I can't ship this and don't have a car...but it can sort of fit into a reasonable trunk for short distances. With a truck, it's not a problem at all. 




 Really? Lucky you!

I'm working with a Geophysics professor now, and he's forcing me to use R. If he'd used Matlab, I could have worked so much quicker :(

 




 I use CU Bus guide. It could be better, but it's quite good and usable right now. It has Nearby stops and easily accessible Favourites...which is more than enough for my usage. 




 Yeah it takes a while...Because it's interpreted, it's quite slow. 

But if you learn to/can vectorize your loops, even the speed is not bad at all! 




 The advantage of matlab is that functions are available for everything! And array manipulation and vector operations are brilliantly simple.

There are many disadvantages, but it's really good as a (scripting-ish) language only for scientific computing and engineering work. It's what it's meant for. 




 Yes. It can be used to do very big things, like run wind tunnels and really big and complicated experiments.
 




 Thanks! My plan was to switch to T-Mobile prepaid in any case with the Nexus 4. So this way I'll get the Nexus, use it for a year and switch to T-Mobile prepaid when the contract is done! 









 Yup...RAW it's going to be for sure...thanks! 




 Wow..thanks a lot!! That's a lot of information right there. Saving the comment and keeping it for reference!  




 Me, I prefer to fuck brave people. Not just here. Anywhere. 




 I've been photographing stuff (mountains and people and leading lines and frames...) for about five years now, but haven't really been doing any processing. Mainly because I really liked the act of getting out in the world and taking pictures, but didn't really feel the need to do much else.

Because of my laziness, my photos now lie scattered across various hard disks, each representing a different era in terms of age, photographic maturity and file naming convention.

I want to set up a workflow now, because I'm starting to feel a need to get organized. I've decided to use Lightroom for this task, because as far as I can see, it has more than enough power to do all the processing I want to do, and also has enough strengths to force me to organize stuff.

I want to learn Lightroom properly. No shortcuts, no nothing. So what should I do? What are some common pitfalls I should look out for? What should I certainly NOT do?

Thanks a lot for any advice you can give me! 




 My friends and I.

Our experience level would be equivalent to the first half of a basic mountaineering course, I guess. We know how to use ice axes and crampons and have used both on climbs before. I can handle ropes from some rock climbing experience, but I haven't used ropes on mountains.

The only reason I ask for Mt Rainier is that I don't really know what being a glacial mountain entails in terms of climbing...what would that be?
 




 I really do want to do mountaineering. I've done some technical climbing before in the Sierra Nevadas and I love it. But I do think it wasn't *too* challenging and it certainly wasn't on a glacier.. 




 I do have questions!

1/ It does look like I won't be able to train this year, so I might have to postpone climbing to next year. I'm getting to Washington by August. What training do you suggest? Where? I dont really want guided tours. I would rather take the time to learn myself and go once I'm ready.

2/ How have you been preparing for this? Do you have experience with glacial climbing?

3/ Nothing here...Thanks for your help! If you're in Seattle and we meet, beer is on me! 




 That's exactly the issue. I know very little about glacier travel... I'm happy to do training, but I'm not getting to the area till August and then it might be too late to do both training and climbing.

Do you know places in Illinois or whereabouts that offer training?

 









 I'm thinking of climbing Mt Rainier in August by the[ Disappointment Cleaver](http://www.summitpost.org/disappointment-cleaver/155670)

I have experience backpacking and climbing mountains with some degree of technical stuff. The route above seems doable.

However, what is this I read about special climbing passes for glacier mountains? Is it necessary? Does everyone in my group have to get it or just me?

Any other advice that you can give me will be awesome!

Thanks! 




 Gravity and centripetal force will act in different directions. Centripetal force acts towards the axis of rotation (in the same plane as the latitude at that point), while gravity acts towards the center of the earth. AT the poles, there is no rotation and hence no centripetal force.

The weight you measure of course, is the sum of all the forces acting towards the center of the earth, so the centripetal force is included in there. Yes, it does reduce your weight.

Not sure why I'm being downvoted, because I'm right. The direction of the forces is different. They're the same at the equator (where the axis passes through the center of the earth) and different at every other latitude. 




 It's because you're working against gravity when you're running uphill. Running uphill is the equivalent of having an extra weight on your back when running on flat land. More work - More difficulty. 




 Ha. The day lines of attack are based on consistency...will be a very good day for sure. But it is not today, evidently. 




 Huh. Actually, you're right. That sentence was quite badly worded.

It's really cool of you that while laughing at my word choice and sentence structure, you also took the time to answer the questions I raised. 




 The links only showcased promiscuity and prevalence of STDs, neither of which represent inefficiency or anti-social tendencies.

Also, the study was flawed not by misconduct, but by poor research practices. If you talk about effects of gay parenting on children, the parents at the very least, have to be gay, right?

EDIT: Also, the real assertion was that inefficiency and anti-social tendencies have something to do with marriage rights. 

So let's see: Gay people are anti-social. No. Gay people are inefficient. I suddenly realized I don't even know what inefficient means in this context. Unless you're talking about the fact that they can't have kids with both parents procreating with each other, that's a No too. 

Even if there were some fictional group of people who were anti-social and "inefficient", why wouldn't you want them to get married? Marriage will only help with anti-social tendencies and whatever inefficiencies are. 




 I want to break free. 




 My code is running in the background, so I have some time and will explore each of these links.

Okay, done exploring. Overall, you seem to be saying that gay people are more promiscuous because of which they have a higher incidence of STDs, which is already well known, is it not? Is that the point you're trying to get across? How does this make them anti-social or inefficient, which is what the commenter above you asked? 

More importantly, what does that have to do with gay marriage? Anti-social and inefficient people can't marry the ones they love? 


This is the only relevant article you've posted...which I had to take from a different comment:

 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X12000610

The study seemed interesting and convincing. Till you realize that what the study treats as "children of gay parents" are actually not that at all. They are children of people who have had at least one homosexual relationship at ANY point in their life, even if they are now heterosexual and happily married to the love of their life, who is of the opposite sex. That is an extreme misrepresentation of what the study purports to say. More info here: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beyond-blood/201206/flawed-study-gay-parenting-roundup-recent-media-coverage-and-critiques

http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/Newsroom/msmpressrelease.html[1]

This says that gay people have a higher incidence of HIV (isn't that well known and accepted already) and suggests that more prevention efforts need to be targeted at them. Very sensible and true. Not sure what that has to do with gay marriage, though. 

 http://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/for-your-health.htm[2]

Again, HIV. What does this have to do with gay marriage? Many diseases (some just as serious has HIV) have large variations across various ethnic and minority and every other kind of groups. Not sure what that has to do with marriage rights.

http://chipts.ucla.edu/2012/05/29/a-comparison-of-sexual-behavior-patterns-among-men-who-have-sex-with-men-and-heterosexual-men-and-women/[3]

This one is again about HIV. In fact, it says: "MSM reported more consistent condom use during anal sex than was reported during vaginal sex by heterosexuals." 

While that means gay people are taking care of the HIV thing (and still have higher HIV incidence rates for a myriad of reasons), I still don't see what that has to do with marriage rights. 

 http://www.thebody.com/content/67321/a-comparison-of-sexual-behavior-patterns-among-men.html[4]

Dude! (Or Dudette). That has exactly the same text as the previous link. Come on!

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876122/pdf/canmedaj01409-0056.pdf[5]

If you're trying to make the point that more healthcare efforts need to be targeted towards gay people, you're making an excellent point. I agree completely. But I still don't understand what that has to do with the issue here, which is gay marriage. Why are you using promiscuity as some yardstick for marriage rights? It doesn't make sense to me.

 http://factsaboutyouth.com/posts/promiscuity/[6]

Okay, first of all, enough with the promiscuity. Gay people have more sex. Good for them! Tell them to use condoms (or whatever it is that lesbians need to use). 

That site says "Reorientation therapy" has been shown to be effective. What the fuck, man? The American Association of Pediatrics said: "The document and website repeat distorted claims that sexual orientation and gender identity are changeable by reparative therapy and that if theyre not reinforced in youth, then their homosexuality and/or transgenderism will eventually go away." (http://www2.aap.org/featured/sexualorientation.htm)

www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/STD.htm[7]

Woah...Cool link. Thanks for telling me that there are diseases that can be transmitted via sex.

 http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2012/08/10/cdc-has-new-plan-for-gonorrhea.html[13] (Homosexuals create a resistant strain of gonorrhea just as scientists are getting HIV under control)

That article actually says gay and bisexual people have increased *resistance* toward gonorrhea and the incidence is reducing in the West of the US. Not sure what you're trying to say.

Okay, back to coding.

**tl;dr**: Good to know you're an atheist. Good to know (I mean in the way that more knowledge is good) that there is a higher incidence of STDs among gay people and more health efforts need to be targeted towards them. Good to know that drug rehabilitation centers are able to target efforts to them as well. None of this however, makes gay people anti-social or inefficient. And the only link that talked about gay marriage didn't talk about gay marriage.  




 Smart man. 




 Just curious: What's a miles card (as in, how is it different from a normal credit card/airlines credit card)? What does it mean to pay cash with it? 




 And here I thought RES was scrolling wrong. 




 You think the grass is greener on your side. Gay people probably think their side is greener. 

Doesn't matter where the grass is greener. Lay on it and look up at the rainbow. 




 Nikon 55-200 mm zoom lens for sale. I'm downgrading to a Micro 4/3rds from a Nikon DSLR. Already sold the camera. Now looking to sell lens.

This is the lens I'm talking about:

All is well with the lens. PM me if interested. 




 That's how my jeans tore!! I've been wondering so long.. 




 Here are some:

**Near** 

Meadowbrook park -- 2 miles paved...~3 if you keep taking deviations into the grass trails and coming back onto the paved trail.  
Crystal lake -- ~ 2 miles road. Some grass.  
Busey woods (right by crystal lake) -- 2 miles on the trail. 1 mile on the boardwalk  
Japan house+ Arboretum -- about 5 miles all around including some pseudo-hidden trails.

**Far** (20 miles):

Lake of the woods -- They have lots of running trails. Paved  
Homer Lake -- 4 miles trail around the lake. Really, really cool trail...My favourite of the bunch.  
Mahomet -- Been biking there..quite a long biking trail with lots of runners too...Paved.  

**Farther** (20 miles):

Allerton -- Very beautiful place. Around 4 miles of trails.  
Kickapoo -- Some short trails. One long 5 mile trail (RiverSomething it's called)  
Turkey run -- Lots of trails (about 10) ranging from 1 mile to 6


 




 I went to undergrad in India. And my college used to host an intercollegiate festival with various competitions. One of these was a fashion show, which was cancelled by the dean because of supposedly indecent exposure.

I was pissed. So I wrote an email, met him and tried to convince him for an hour...to no avail.

So my friend and I decided to take the air out of his scooter tires. We drove up there at night, but couldn't figure out which out of three his scooter was.

So instead, we went up all the way to the third floor to his house and stole his milk bag.

That was our fuck you to the system. One day without milk for the dean! 




 I'm taking CS 418 right now...it's nothing you can't learn on your own with a little enthusiasm, because tutorials abound online for every topic that's taught in the class.

Most of every MP can be just solved directly from examples on the web.

If you're really interested in Graphics and are prepared to go above and beyond the call of duty, it's a great course. Otherwise, you can get by and get a reasonable grade without really learning much.
 




 Me too. And I did it after I read your comment. Umm... just to make sure you were actually that dumb.

I was right. Ha! 









 Only rich people can get respect because their car breaks down! 




 Uh shit. The funny thing is...the pressure cooker I use right now is one of those oval lid ones...

Actually it's not so funny. Imagining those things bursting is really scary...Because they fit inside, so the explosion must be even worse :O 




 Enough remained in the cooker for lunch, thankfully... And they tasted great!  




 It's on the album Voice (the studio version). She does only one Beethoven composition on there, and I think the live version is better.

The rest of the songs are amazing too! 




 Indian reporting in. We use pressure cookers for a lot of our cooking. Lentils. Rice. Vegetables...

Once I was trying to impress my mum with my newly acquired cooking skills. She left for work with the promise of lentils when she came back. Well, the cooker "exploded". It was loud. The lid was around the cooker. But the lentils were everywhere. The ceiling (11 ft high), the walls of the kitchen. Some of them even made it to the adjacent rooms.

Though if you follow instructions, you'll be fine. 









 Those were actually the lines I was most uncomfortable with...now I know why! Thanks! :) 




 It's meant to be choppy, yes. Punctuation's always a hassle for me. I never know what to do really. So usually, I just take it all out. 

I could ideally space the poem out more with whitespace, but that seems a little pretentious to me.

 The snow was white    
Now mostly gone  
What's left is brown

The grass and the trees  
Are now back in town  
A happy green  

The sky was white  
Now a little blue  
With shades of grey

My mother  
Shes in all these things  
Shes with me  

Or shes not  
You know how it is  

Rationalizations, lukewarm blue  
Play a game with  
Reality, freezing gray

The winner gets me  

Two red birds  
(A brilliant red  
As if they just came   
To be included in my poem)  

Fritter around and make  
Bright squeaky sounds  

My mother  
Shes behind this  
Only she could know  
Exactly what I needed   




 That is the exact thought process I'm going through right now... It's good to see that you made the switch and are happy with it... It gives me a lot of confidence.

Thanks!  




 That's just the body, right? With the lens, the cost ist at $400. The E-PL3 is available for $300 with lens refurbished at Cameta, and I'm leaning towards it.

Any reason to prefer the GX1 over the E-PL3? 




 What do you mean by 12 MP sensors are weak? I don't really mind the difference between 12 and 16 MP since I won't be making large prints...but is there something else technical to consider that makes the 16 MP version better? 




 Ah...thanks! So 10-30 mm is equivalent to 18-55 mm? 

I can always buy the lenses later, when my budget gets replenished :) 




 With my D40 I had a zoom (55-200) that I never used. I was very happy with my prime (50 mm) even though I had to focus manually and the kit 18-55 lens. 




 There are some amazing deals on Camera...I'm leaning towards the E-PL3...It's available for $299...do you think that's a good price? 




 I was just going to ask that...In fact, the E-PL3 from Cameta refurbished is $299

EDIT: Here's a decent comparison in which E-PL2 turns out to be the winner: http://snapsort.com/compare/Olympus-E-PL2-vs-Olympus_PEN_E-PL1 




 I've used  Nikon D40 for six years and I've always imagined that I'll be upgrading an SLR with better specs.

But this recent onslaught of mirrorless cameras with slightly smaller sensors has really got me intrigued. My main aim with photography is to take good pictures while hiking and backpacking. So these cameras seem to fit perfectly into what I want to do.

Does anyone have experience using them? What brands/models would you recommend? What are the numbers I should be looking out for? 

My budget is around $500. Megapixels don't matter and I don't have to have the newest model at all. So there are a lot of options from me from Nikon, Panasonic, Sony, Olympus... Any help?
 




 And then I felt better about myself... Because he was worse off than me. 

Man, I don't get the point of these quotes 




 Not a noob, kind Sir/Ma'am. But I get your point, shall move on! 




 My last laptop ran only Linux...the distro varied through the years, but Linux was all that was on it.

I bought the Vizio CT15-A5 ultrabook recently and it's gorgeous and all, but it comes with Windows 8.

Does anyone have any experience with how Linux friendly this laptop is w.r.t hardware?

Also, I remember reading about problems with dual booting with Windows 8...UEFI and all that? What kind of issues arise because of that?

Thank you for any help you kind people provide. 




 For Algorithms, *The Algorithm Design Manual* by Skiena is incredible. It's written well and skimps a bit on rigor knowingly and just enough to give you an intuitive idea of what's going on.

For Machine Learning, it's best if you take one of the courses on coursera (or read the notes that you have AND implement the assignments/homeworks) because you learn much more even about the theoretical aspects by implementation.

In my experience so far (MS in Computer Science with research in Machine Learning/Computer Vision) Information theory is used only sparingly, and when used, it's more to say that "From Information theory, we know that...."

 




 I assume they're just making the app full screen and implementing their own notification system.. 

Not sure though, really.. Not my area of expertise.  




 No. I think the article says the HTC First is the only phone that will show the actual notifications.

What that means is that if you were to download the Home app on a Samsung Galaxy S3 you wouldn't get system notifications while using the new Facebook Home app.

You would still get them inside Android, but you wouldn't get them in the Home notifications," confirmed Ondrejka.

 Thanks! I'll take your advice and drive around in May and then look for apartments again when I come back in August...all good! 




 I did read the sidebar, actually...I was more curious about the dates...Thanks for the information!

 




 Yo all,

I'm moving to Seattle in August. I was planning to come down (well up) with my dad in May and look for apartments. Is that too early? 

Given that I'll be working in downtown, where should I be thinking about living? I don't mind a longish commute if the neighborhood is worth it. My cousin sings praises of Capitol Hill.

Thanks for any help provided!
 




 Urbana-Champaign here. 




 Yup I agree with that. I had far fewer bridges to cross than OP. 

But the point I'm trying to make is that the companies won't care. They will only look at how good a programmer he/she is when he/she applies, not whether he has a BS degree. At least some companies. 



If 

 




 Well, the job I got had nothing to do with Aerospace...I guess it did help me get my foot in the door. 

To get the job, all you need CS coding skills. Just learn from coursera or something.

I was taking CS courses all along even when I was in Aero because I liked that stuff. So really, if you like programming, keep programming and things will fall into place.  




 Yes. I have a BS in Aero, an MS in aero, a PhD in Aero that I quit in order to pursue an MS in CS.

2 months into the MS, I had a job. I think it's more of what's on your resume, because software companies really, really need good talent. So build your skillset and you should be good to go.  




 Ooh nice question.

Arbitrarily small sizes are a pain because molecular effects come into play. But even there, angular momentum is conserved (I think...I vaguely remember something about conserving angular momentum...but an expert shoudl chime in).

But otherwise, angular momentum has nothing to do with restriction. It's a property of the particles. For water with no bathtub, angular momentum is conserved. The angular momentum of the whole ocean is conserved too.

The angular momentum of fluid particles rotating about a vortex center is conserved, irrespective of how close you get to the center (arbitrarily small size), if that's what you're asking. I keep talking about vortices because they kind of generate angular momentum in flows. But the discussion holds true in their absence too, of course.
 




 Yes. All the time. Fill bathtub with water, rotate hand. Remove hand. Angular momentum is conserved, or rather, would have been conserved if it hadn't been for that cursed viscosity.

Planes fly because of lift. Lift generation is explained by vortex structures leaving the plane. The behavior of these vortices (again discounting for cursed viscosity) is governed by the conservation of angular momentum, among other things.

Angular momentum is a property that applies to anything that Newton's Laws applies to, because its conservation is a form of Newton's Laws!
 




 I think the account is active for a year, after which forwarding is active for two more. Not sure of the exact numbers, but it's in that ballpark. 




 Except for stop signs, the other two are legal. Cyclists CAN cross as both pedestrians and vehicles and it is in fact acceptable for them to ride on the road. Unless you're talking about pedestrian sidewalks..those bikers be bad. 




 It is not really just stretching. Breathing and meditation are what make Yoga, yoga. 

It's taught in a form that emphasizes the stretching here, which is sad, but necessary to market it effectively.

The benefits that are marketed (inner peace and all that crap) don't come without a huge investment of time and effort into Yoga. And personally, I believe that a similar focus on any activity will give you the same inner peace and crap.

To be fair, Yoga as it was intended is only a way of living. There is even a Yoga called Karma Yoga which says that if you do your duty, you are doing yoga. 

I think what differentiates Yoga from other fitness activities is the philosophical backend. That philosophical backend, however is transferable to any activity. I don't know why people don't do that...maybe because Yoga is a selling point... 




 I'll answer the two parts separately (source: My mom received a PhD in Yoga and is part of the transitioning of knowledge from the second half (what the "inventors" did) to the first half (today's scientifically accepted facts )). 

Also, this is an Indian perspective. It seems similar to what I see in the US, but I don't know if my cultureFilter glasses are effective.

The "original" Yogasanas were only loosely scientific. They were based more on the "sages" experimenting with their bodies. When I move this part, I feel something in that part, so if I stretch this way, it must be beneficial. Also, that animal seems to look cool in that pose. It seems like that will help me, let me try that. 

I know that's vague, but the point is that they did not do experiments in a repeatable, verifiable manner. There were no guidelines for people with problems to not do certain asanas. So no, they were not scientific.

However, personal anecdotes and development led to a very strong belief in Yoga. Especially since it was so intimately tied to the Hindu religion. 

Forward to today: There are yoga quacks who teach yogasanas. I know of a case where a teacher made his students do a complex breathing exercise (Bastri + Kapalabhati). He DID NOT tell them (probably did not know either) that the exercise involves extensive use of the lower back. And people came to my mom with damaged lower backs... and they just wanted to do more Yoga to help!! (Well, yoga is excellent for lower back problems, but I'mn sure you see the point I'm making).

The only way out of this is to scientifically examine the effects and benefits of Yoga, and that's what a LOT of researchers are doing these days.

The problem is that the scientific method looks at Yogasanas in a very atomic way instead of a holistic way since well, the "holistic" way is not scientific. It's a fair compromise, I think.

I digressed a lot there. but: 

*tl;dr*: Inventors of Yoga made up asanas based on trial and error and logic. They did not go ahead to scientifically test the benefits and effects of their asanas because they believed in self-experimentation. So, scientific examination is being done today.


 




 I have this conversation sometimes with my friend in fleeting corridor moments.

Me: What's up?  
Him: You too.


 




 Neither did I! I was just making a bad joke about the importance of punctuation in your second attempt at perfect honesty. 

TBPH,  the joke didn't even make sense.  




 It's always good to be perfectly honest  




 I think what eshemuta means is something similar to what you are saying and it is something I experienced recently.

On a hike near Seattle, I didn't take my camera and I was marveling at the scenery and the light and the place. I could see the scene completely differently because of my efforts with photography. But without the thoughts of taking a picture, the experience was completely different.

It's like sitting for half an hour on your streetcorner, admiring the light and...that's it. It's a different experience. Different from the photographer taking the picture and different from the guy who likes the view, but doesn't know the things a photographer does. 




 Yeah you just create a new category saying "The ones that don't follow any of the above patterns and follows unpredictable reality", which is exactly the case here. 




 I agree with all you said in the first paragraph... But to me, people who achieve that state of writing  regularly, writing with discipline... They're magicians.. 

Discipline is the new magic. The old magic is just a bag of tricks.  




 Wow...that video was intense! 




 "Big Data" is a buzzword these days, and any company that deals with them is looking for Data Scientists and are very pleased if you can show some Machine Learning background.

Of course, robotics is booming. Companies are looking for talent very seriously and they need MS students that can do their work. 




 Yup, that's what I thought too.

But then, here they're only worried about making it look realistic. For example, if you wanted the stresses at every point on the cloth when you tear it this code wouldn't give it. But your months-to-make code will. 

If I was the head of a clothing company, I would use your code to design my clothes, and his code for advertising.

Though it *is* still *amazing*, that they're able to simulate the looks of a cloth tearing.
 




 They call it simple because an analytic solution is available that they can compare the numerical solution to.

It's just an exponential term plus an error term.  




 I just saw this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8Vwu4cdFFw 

And then exploration began...hadn't heard of her before... now can't stop listening to her! 









 If you're problem is depression, this isn't the subreddit you should be looking for answers in.  




 I don't think the balance is fine at all. I'm heavily on your side in this argument. Googling is okay, I guess, only as long as you make sure you're understanding what's going on enough to not make the same mistake. 

And that understanding is kind of enforced if you don't have Google... 

Well... The line is kind of fine :-)  




 Oh...yeah that's not your fault either. They should see EE and Java and realize that you probably know Java and programming through your EE courses, which have a very different emphasis than the CS courses. 

I was an Aerospace PhD who switched to a CS Masters...so I feel ya.

It would help though, if you read up a bit on Design Patterns and Algorithms...What I did was read up on two CS courses -- 1/ Data Structures and 2/ Algorithms ... that should cover your bases.

In interviews, they generally ask you to rate your skills on a 1 to 10. Be honest. Say you're comfortable with the language, but are learning the concepts, and then talk a bit about Abstract classes and Singletons and all that cool stuff you think they think you should know.
