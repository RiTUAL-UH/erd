 Didn't even see that, thank you!  









 Ha. 




 You complained about an opinion/analysis piece, when you are reading entries to a subreddit that is based on opinions/analysis. So sorry, thought you would have understood that; didn't know I had to clarify. 









 I replied. 




 I guess you don't understand the fact that *I don't care* about what you think. I believe that the message is a good one, and for that reason, I posted it. 

*Get over it* and **go complain elsewhere.**

Furthermore, /r/inthenews is for opinion and analysis--so, if you don't want analysis or opinion then don't come to this particular subreddit with your complaints. Find an opinion/analysis you like or support and post it--but don't come here and whine about opinion pieces.  









 Go for it 





























 Yes!! 





























 I'm an asshole, I'm so sorry lol 




 Still not editorialized. You can have an opinion on the quote--and as you perceive it to imply some sort of 'weakness'. However, I see it has passion, strength, and commitment. The *fact* remains that the title was not editorialized as you initially suggested it was.  









 Very true 




 Finally, speaking some truth
Clinton may have opinions on these and other topics and wont tell us what they are. Alternatively, she may only figure out what she thinks once the political winds are settled. Either way, this is not presidential behavior. 



















 Thank you! 




 Taking a direct quote from the article is not editorializing the headline/title.  





























 Agreed, reading and I would say embrace the outdoors 




 Wondering the same thing... It would be totally awkward if they just sat there stiff not eating lmao. I'll try to find out though :) 




 omg lol, I didn't even notice. eeek :/ 




 I totally agree with you! Last month almost *all* HP articles were downplaying his candidacy as well as his personality and/or the way he looks/dresses (but that's one of the things I love most about him--he doesn't care what people think; all he cares about is getting the job done).
