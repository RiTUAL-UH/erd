 Numbers? 




 Based on the very little I know about this sport, I feel expanding the 'court' to allow a third player on each team would make it a lot better. A goalie who maybe had a bike geared (pun unintended) towards less actual movement and more blocking (I have no idea what such a bike would look like. Scenes from Mad Max come to mind), almost like the special gear of a hockey goalie. Without a dedicated goal keeper the threat of the hail-mary-cherry-picker is all to real. A third player would also add to the intensity and awesomeness.

I feel like I'm writing a letter to the minister of cycle ball or something. 




 Welp, I'm off to Google 'quasi-legally'. 




 What in the hell... 




 Lol thought you were going to say /r/trees, which is kind of a perfect fit. 




 Aw, fuck now I absolutely gotta go find my little guy just for a hug:( This might be a bit of a search, he's very small and very quiet. 




 I'm about 85% sure there are pieces of actual cookies in it.

 Dude, Americone Dream is where it's at. Either that or Milk and Cookies. Not Cookie Dough, Milk and Cookies. Big difference. Fuck, now I gotta go get Ben and Jerrys. 




 I wish I had more than one sibling to understand the concept of one being a butt and one not. I can't imagine looking at one sibling very differently than the others. 




 I grossly misunderstood two things about your story:

**A:** I thought you were a girl the whole time. Not sure why, sorry about that. Had to reread a second time to figure that out.

**B:** I thought they were 6 and 11 years younger than *you*. I could not for the life of me understand why you were taking a nine year old (don't disprove me with math, I'm in no condition) to an R rated movie, let alone smoking with them. Had to reread about three and a half times before I figured that one out.

**C:** How was Ted 




 Did...did you have super sonic hearing too? 




 I just saw Dark Skies, and I'm 100% convinced you got abducted by aliens.

 **The Battle of Red Cliffs**

Unlike most military victories where the smaller side somehow scares the other side into foolishly fleeing or surrendering, Zhou Yu beat 800,000 men with his measly 50,000 *in battle*. He did it by first antagonizing the opposing Emperor Cao Cao to attacking his position across the Yangtze River. Before crossing however, one of his spies working as an adviser for Cao Cao recommended that he chain his ships together to 'reduce sea sickness among the unseasoned soldiers'. As soon as Yu saw the misinformed fleet attempt to cross he sent fire boats at them, which started a fire that spread to every ship given their conveniently close proximity to one another. That was the battle that ended the Han dynasty. Imagine being the person that ended your own dynasty with 800,000 men against 50,000. And that's just the smallest estimate, others said it was upwards of 200,000. 




 Holy shit, those birds from the Windex commercials were right... 




 (Yes) ? 




 I'll pretend to get it 




 It's just 'Pound', not Pound Town. Nice try, OP. 




 "She definitely noticed" 




 No, it's just bad. I assume you're on Netflix? Instead, watch...

**[Nightcrawler] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kYDQan8bw)** Unless you're easily creeped out. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a rather...odd character, and he absolutely nail the roll. It's good though, all about people who film accidents and dangerous events for the news and maybe even go a little too far to get the shot. Awesome movie, I might be over hyping the creepiness a little.

**[The Big Lebowski] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd-go0oBF4Y)** Hilarious, well at least to normal people. Some don't seem to 'understand' this type of humor. I've honestly never loved Jeff Bridges more than after seeing The Big Lebowski, and that's saying a lot for me. In my humble opinion, everyone in the world should see this movie.

**[Dark Skies] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8iLp1xQtPQ)** One of my favorite and most underrated horror movies out there. Soo many good ideas in it, I'm not sure who directed Dark Skies but they did a great job. And J.K. Simmons is in it! Totally my tempo.

**[Chef] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgFws3AoIUY)** *WARNING: THIS WILL MAKE THE MUNCHIES ABOUT A MILLION TIMES WORSE. PROCEED WITH CAUTION* I have no idea how they got so many big name actors in an indie movie, but they did it. I'm usually not one for the easy, unstimulating watches, but they managed to keep this movie a little edgy at the same time. Would definitively recommend.

**[Inglorious Bastards] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AtLlVNsuAc)** One of my favorite Tarantino movies out there. Plenty of blood and gore so be prepared for that. If you like that one, you'll love **[Django] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUdM9vrCbow)** too. Christopher Waltz and Quentin Tarantino together again! Django also (although it isn't a commedy movie) has one of the [funniest scenes] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsaxyraBdQ8) ever too. Not sure why Jonah Hill agreed to come out just for one scene, but I'm sure glad he did. Amazing acting in both movies.

**[Hot Fuzz] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayTnvVpj9t4)** I can't be the only one that fucking loves Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Personally, my favorite is Paul, but that one isn't on Netflix. Awesome awesome awesome movie though.

**[Arrested Development] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfU2Td_MMf0)** It's not a movie (it's a TV show) but just give the first episode a shot, and I promise there's like a 70% chance you'll absolutely fall in love with it. Probably my favorite comedy TV show of all time. And Netflix is making season 5 as we speak! 




 I won't even ask how the lighter fits into the equation. 




 In my experience, everything suddenly turns to slow motion, you turn to your smoke mates in despair, cue [the dream] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16i0_NdPowE t=0m10s), and dramatically drop the roach off the bow of the ship as you wipe a lone tear from your eye. Adieu, sweet blunt, adieu. 




 Good god I could go on for hours. What kind of music are you into, lets start there.

 OP, I'm a little rusty on my Nepalese marijuana policy info, is it legal? If not, is it illegal enough to stop you from, say, harvesting said wild growth and claiming it for personal uses?

 To be fair, both have lead to some shaky personal decision making.

Drunk = Lets go swimming in the local pond!

Stoned = Do you think peanut butter and sour cream would go well together?

I'd say they can both potentially be 'harmful', but with weed the only person you could harm is yourself.

 I dropped a quarter. Yup, I dropped a fucking quarter. I was at bagel store paying the last dollar in change, I like to give exact change if I can. I dropped the quarter, picked it up, hit my head on the counter on the way up. I imagine someone knocking themselves out by hitting their head on a counter probably looked pretty funny from a third person prospective, but it wasn't nearly as humorous from mine. A few moments later I woke up and was driven to the hospital by one of the girls that worked there. I insisted that I was fine but apparently it wasn't up for debate (I think the very grumpy owner was worried about getting sued). As we crossed an intersection about half way to the hospital the back of her car got hit by a speeding driver. As it turns out, this guy was a pretty hard core drug dealer. He had a metric SHIT TON of weed, cocaine and other drugs I haven't even heard of in his car. As compensation for the damage and agreeing not to call the cops, he gave the bagel girl $6,000ish in cash, and me $1,500 for going with it I guess. There was a giant nug of weed between one of her little stacks of money, not sure if that was an accident or not. Anyhow, we didn't go to the hospital I just said we should go get her car fixed. We're still very close friends today. The drug dealer gave her his number in case he didn't give her enough money (which was absurd, her whole car wasn't worth that much). That ended up having it's own impact on our lives too. Not even necessarily in the way you'd expect, we kind of know him now, he invites us to a lot of parties.

EDIT: Reading this over makes me realize my life could have been a lot more boring.

**TL;DR Dropped a quarter in a store, bent down to pick it up, knocked myself out on the counter on the way up, got driven to the hospital by a worker, her car got hit by a drug dealer on the way there, he gave us a lot of money to not call the cops and for the damage, still know them both pretty well today and have a pretty good party story.** 




 17 (I think). I drank half of a smallish bottle of rum (as I was told was the customary amount) and ended up stealing a probably very expensive but rather small ice sculpture, climbed a street light, accidentally marched in a gay pride parade, and then returned half of the ice sculpture and a case of bottled water. I'm told who ever owned the sculpture didn't share our sense of humor. I didn't stick around to see for myself. Didn't puke though! Saved that for the second time.

Really? *That's* what comes to mind?? 




 Go to kids sports games with friends and sit really really far away so we don't piss off the parents. Then we announce the game as if it is a professional level event, developing elaborate back stories for the players as we go. We end up cheering for both teams, as well as cheering against both teams (not loud enough for them to hear obviously). Chants and songs have been developed for each team, and even a few players. Celebration dances and typical sporting event crowd nonsense (the 'wave' for example) are also included. We've even gone as far to ask the kids for autographs and fist bumps after the games. They just think it's awesome, and the moms tend to be too naive to suspect anything. Everyone has a good time. 




 As a son of over protective parents, I feel I should stress the importance of not being overbearing. Not something you have to worry about anytime soon, but especially for when they get to be 13-18. My parents were crazy, they put parental controls on everything (computer, TV, phones, etc.), they didn't allow dating, I couldn't stay out past 9:30 and I couldn't see friends on weekdays. It was incredibly embarrassing and just encouraged me to become increasingly secretive and sneaky. I've seen it over and over again, families that are run by strict parents don't encourage trust. Don't make the same mistakes. I know it's a long way down the road, but something to keep in mind.

 I'm sorry, had to log on just to call complete bull shit on that. Your first time might have been awesome, but it *definitely* doesn't have to be anywhere near the best you can expect. I can clearly remember my first two times, and neither of them were anything special. In contrast to yours, it just goes to show that every time is different. There are a ton of factors that could go into why it wasn't the same, but you're tolerance probably isn't one of them. It may have gone up marginally since the first time, but not enough to make that big a difference.

I would recommend next time you do it in the early/middle day. That would leave you better rested and make it easier to resist the urge to go to sleep when it comes and go do something fun instead. fatmenareepiccooks was actually right though about indicas causing sleepiness in perticular, I would try a sativa if you could get your hands on it.

Every method is slightly different too. Somking, edibles, vaping, dabbing, etc. are all different in their own ways. Edibles tend to be more intense and longer lasting, I personally like them better, but you could easily have an equally good-even better-experience another way, say smoking. I would also try it with other people, that's usually more fun. Just do your own thing though and don't take any thing anyone says too seriously (including me). In the end everyone is different, so go try everything out by yourself and don't be deterred or motivated based off of what people say on the internet. Good luck! 




 Varys, Ned Stark, Stannis Barathron, Hot Pie (not even kidding), Khal Drogo, Arya Stark, Bronn, Davos Seaworth, Margery Tyrell, Syrio Forel and Joffrey Baratheon.

In contrast, they missed: Daario Naharis (both times), Jamie Lannister, Theon Greyjoy, Mance Rayder, Renly Baratheon, Meera/Jojen Reed, every single Sand Snake and all of the characters they left out but shouldn't have.

Not that all the characters they missed were necessarily worse, or bad even, but they were very different from the versions GRRM had laid out in the books. 




 It didn't work. 




 Woah, how did you still find this? 




 Lots of people quit watching the show because they hate getting attached to characters just to see them die. I've been pretty on board with it though, I like how it makes the show more realistic, the good guys don't always win. That being said, I would be so done with this shit if any of that happened.

EDIT: After thinking about it, I think we can discount this one. Azor Ahai is supposed to have some sort of ancestral link to the Targaryens, which Jorah obviously doesn't. The only two *real* contenders are Dany and Jon, no matter how you try and look at it. 




 Fuckin' Olly 




 I think Balon's was more of a "Quick! They're not looking, grab what you can!"

EDIT: Some of the comments regarding comparisons to World War II, ISIS and renaissance era diplomacy have taken this comment way too seriously... 




 You left out a few:

* Trystane Martell: I don't think he will have a *huge* roll in the next season, but they wouldn't have taken him along for the ride if he wasn't going to make a few appearances. Maybe another trial by combat volunteer like Oberyn? Maybe they'll find someone else for him to marry up in Kings Landing? His little story line is very uncertain, but he'll almost certainly be back.

* Jorah: There's a good chance he either dies, or cuts off his arm this season. I don't see him cutting it off, they already did that whole thing with Jamie. He could survive without cutting it off, but that only happens very rarely. Either way, he'll have a rough time on his road trip with Daario, and I wouldn't be shocked if he didn't make it through the season.

* Arya: She regains her sight after she kills the guy on the docks like she was supposed to. In the books that what happened, accept her blindness was a part of the training, not a punishment. Either way she eventually gets it back and becomes a near fully trained faceless man by the end of the season. Maybe even hitches a ride back to Westeros with Dany.

* Lady Stoneheart: I feel like GRRM wouldn't bring her back unless she was pretty important. I'd love to find out what that important thing is in season 6/Winds of Winter. What ever this 'thing' is though, I think we can guarantee it's very revenge based. S6E9 anyone?

* Stannis: I personally think he's dead. On the off chance I'm wrong though, he could make a big difference in the story line. He doesn't have an army though, so he wouldn't have to team up with or join someone that does.

* Davos: I love him as an honorary member of the nights watch. He really has no where else to go at this point. I hope they don't abandon the story line though.

* Jon: I know you covered Jon, but I can't imagine them holding on to Jon's body for 10 episodes. They are going to burn him, but and either hes dead, or he'll walk out of the fire like Dany with a little help from Mel. Him and Dany supposedly have similar ancestory after all, it's not a stretch to expect they'll both be 'reborn' in the same way.

* Bran/Rickon: Not sure why they missed a season, I guess they're story is a little slow. I really want them to be in the opening scene. Anyhow, major potential spoilers: [Season 6/Winds of Winter] (#g "In the books, Bran can see back in time using weirwood trees. There is a theory that Bran will discover Jon's parentage this way, since Rhaegar and Lyanna were supposedly very conveniently married in secret under a weirwood tree. I think this will be the way R+L=J will be revealed, assuming it does. Rickon, Meera, Hodor and that other girl whos name I forget will go down to Castle Black to deliver the news. Mostly because it would be very boring for them to stick around in the same place all season, and someone needs to tell Jon. I think this is likely because they need a way for Bran to stay engaged in the story. If this, or something else pretty major, doesn't happen, he'll just be sitting around watching everyone else but not actually interacting at all.") I wanted to block that just because it would be pretty huge if it turned out to be correct.

* Uncle Ben: They put up too much hype around him for him not to show up eventually. That might not be season 6 though, they could push it all the way back to 7 if they wanted. Still, I think we're closing in on his grand appearance. He could very well be an ice zombie by now though. Some people think he would be a white walker, but that only happens to the ones that were taken and raised from birth. And it seems very unlikely that he survived north of the wall for that long.

* Cersi: She has something wrong with her foot and everything goes down hill for her from there. It was said that 'Jamie was born holding Cersi's foot in his hand'. Having Jamie's hand cut off and Cersi's foot somehow injured would be pretty symbolic. And Qyburn said something about her injured foot at the end of season 5. Either way, she's completely and utterly defeated leaving Tommen and Jamie to run Westeros on their own. She might kill that nun though.

* Robin: Everyone's favorite brat gets to come back with Littlefinger. That's gonna suck. He might end up marrying Sansa eventually too, if Ramsey dies. I assume his time becoming less of a bitch has been slightly transformative for him, but not enough for him to be the least bit likable.

* Sam: He and Gilly and Sam go down to Oldtown where he gets a probably dull but potentially interesting story line involving how he becomes a maester. We get to see Oldtown, yay! He comes back to castle black by the end of the season but leaves Gilly and Sam in Oldtown for safekeeping.

* Hot Pie: Stories of his kidney pie and wolf cookies spread throughout the Seven Kingdoms. In every great hall, songs are sung about how he didn't give up on the gravy, and how he got his hands on a good bottom round steak despite the ongoing war. His new found fame has made him the lands first celebrity chef. His new restaurant, 'Cuisine de Tartes Chaudes', has a wait list that goes back ten months, you need to know someone to get in. He regularly caters to exclusive events, such as Clegane Bowl I and the Purple Wedding. His new book 'Unburnt, Unbraised, Unbroiled, How a Visionary from Flea Bottom Changed the World of Cooking' is highly anticipated, and is said to be coming out some time after The Winds of Winter. He's writing as fast as he can. 




 Best Game of Thrones party tricks.

 Chuck Testa 




 Would you rather have nothing? Because there is/was no other way to do it. 




 He doesn't speak of having any association with the lord of light until he [ADWD] (#b "is on his death bed"). At that point it seems as if he desperately needs someone to pass on the information so he brings it up. The people he tells just think he's crazy at that point, it's just for the dramatic irony. Personally though, I believed he was right. I can't explain why, just the way GRRM had it play out in the books.

EDIT: Actually now that I think about it, Ameon has talked about it in events prior. I still think he's a more reliable source considering Mel's inconsistency. 




 I think he said he had a three way with a married couple he met on OkCupid when he was a crazy 19 year old. And then he said he said he was currently 20. 




 That's awesome. 




 "Once in a blue moon" 




 I was expecting something like "I'm 34 now". For all we know dude, that could have happened yesterday. 




 I'm so conflicted about giving you an upvote for the best possible answer to this question, or a downvote for one of the most messed up things I've ever heard. 




 Could we at least substitute it with 'that's what she said'? 




 They absolutely are, did you even read the books? Why do you think Jon is dead? Or Arya is blind? Or Cersi confessed? Of course there are some major changes, but the show still follows the general path GRRM has laid out, especially with regards to major events. 




 1. Varys is the master of secrets and his little birds
2. A popular fan theory concerns the mother of Jon
3. Joer is the father of Jorah, who used to trade slaves
4. An infamous disease is greyscale, which in the show is currently infecting Jorah
5. Ramsey Snow was legitimized by his father
6. Jeyne Pool was substituted by Sansa in the show
7. Qyburn is not an actual maester
8. The first city Daenerys visited was Qarth 




 I don't think there is any reason to be 'three', and I honestly don't even see any signs pointing in that direction other than the sidgle. If they wanted Aegon to be in the show, they would have introduced him already. And what reason is there for him to be the 'ice representative' (feels funny to say it like that)? In the books there is nothing to support that. 




 [ADWD] (#b "If this goes by the books I think we can go ahead and dis-confirm this. Before dying I think Ameon said something like "Melisandre was wrong, Stan isn't the chosen one, Dany is". There is obviously a decent chance it might not go by the books, but that would be a pretty huge thing to change between the two story lines.") 




 Wishful thinking. As much as I would love to see that, the one other time they tried a flashback it really fell flat. Especially as a season opener. It also seems like way too big of an event to put into the opening minutes of the first episode. I mean book readers have been waiting for years and years for this, and it's going to happen five minutes into season 6? I couldn't imagine it going down that distastefully. 




 Holy shit it might just be me but that actually seems like a lot. How much was in each bag? 




 Instantly. Literally before you even knew it. 




 Well the stregenth of gravity is inversely proportional to it's distance from it's source, but it will never reach zero. That means that yes, us humans are effecting the gravitational strain on literally everything that has mass, including black holes.

This however is really only significant on a mathematical level. The amount of gravitational influence we would give off to such a huge object so far away would be as close to none at all as you could get.

Most galaxies in fact have a super massive black hole at their center. Ours does. It acts similarly to the Sun in our solar system, but on a much much larger scale.

The Sun is pulling towards us gravitationally, but we are in an orbit because we also have inertia. Think about it, if it was *only* the Sun's gravity we would be pulled right into it. Instead our own momentum keeps us orbiting the Sun.

We don't orbit in a perfect circle because the momentum could almost never be perfect enough to allow for such a thing to happen, regardless of other forces pulling on us. There really is no such thing as a perfect circular orbit.

Theoretically any black hole could gather the entire mass of the universe. Lucky for us, the black hole would probably decay before swallowing up everything. Although the universe is not yet old enough for it to happen yet, black holes will eventually die out. Despite how ridiculously long their lifetimes are, I doubt one would be able to collect all of the mass of the universe before fading away.

If it did somehow achieve this though, it probably would not explode. Nothing can escape a black hole, not light or even an explosion. Even if something was to explode inside the black hole, it wouldn't be able to even effect anything on the outside. It probably wouldn't recreate the Big Bang. 




 Spaghettiception. 




 I hate to break it to you, but yes. 




 They can decay theoretically, though the universe is not yet old enough to even come to the end of a black hole's life. 




 They can decay theoretically, though the universe is not yet old enough to even come to the end of a black hole's life. 




 A black hole is as large as it's apparent horizon, not it's event horizon. A black hole the size of a baseball would have an even horizon much much further away. 




 I'm not sure where you go that from. The center of the Earth has no gravitational pull. It slowly becomes stronger as you move towards the surface. Once you get there it slowly recedes again as you move away into the atmosphere. The 'source' is the consolidation of it's mass. It pulls you towards it's center because that is it's central most point of mass. 




 I saw an opportunity and I jumped on it. 




 You could obviously never get that close to the event horizon in the first place with out being sucked in. That was just an example. 




 The size of a black hole is not the size of its event horizon. The black hole itself is the mass that makes it up. It's event horizon is the point at which that masses gravitational pull overcomes the force of light.

The very definition of singularity is it's so small it cannot become smaller, yet your argument is based off of making a black hole smaller? Shrunk to the size of a nickel? He was speaking in theory, it's not possible. 




 Your nerves would eventually become disconnected, but I would think  up until that point it would probably hurt. I mean imagine your hand falling off one atom at a time within a minute. You're loosing big chunks of hand at a time, that cant possibly feel great.

In the end, no one has experienced it, and even if they did they wouldn't live to talk about it, so we'll never know. It would probably happen rather quickly though. 




 There is so much that would kill us before we got to the black hole, this is just a 'what if'. 




 It would probably be doomed to fail. If we could harness the energy of just gravity, our energy crisis would be solved!

Many believe black holes *are* wormholes and that if you were to somehow survive the journey into one you would come out in another part of the universe or even in a different universe all together. This is all theory though, it would be impossible to prove. 




 It would happen with both. The singularity leaves no survivors. Once you pass within the event horizon you are exposed to roughly the same gravity no matter the size of the black hole, to an extent of course. 




 If it's in your pocket, than your already well with it's event horizon though... What point does that make supporting what you're saying?  




 Well we could be sucked towards a black hole before reaching the event horizon, that just the point at which we wouldn't be able to escape.

But yes, one could pull us without destroying the planet. As long as the gravitational pull is strong enough to overcome that of the sun and the inertia of the Earth's orbit, but not strong enough to suck us in, we would be pulled off of our orbit.

That applies to anything that has a gravitational pull though, not necessarily a black hole.
