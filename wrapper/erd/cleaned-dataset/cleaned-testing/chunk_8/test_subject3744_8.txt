 Always nice and shiny without a single water spot.  




 Why do i think i'm going to see the posted all over the place the rest of the day. 




 Usually they aren't 6 miles deep and 50 miles away from the nearest city. 




 wait... The top post less than 2 hours old has /u/iBleeedorange commenting on it? Did Earth's magnetic field shift? Usually you are the top of the frontpage and others are commenting on it.  




 We would have shit galore? 

 




 We all are... 




 SoCal water isn't much warmer, but you do have better beaches. 




 Water is too cold in NorCal. 




 Maybe, maybe not. 




 Where is Cover beach? 




 This was a pretty shallow quake though, not much to be worried about other than a tsunami wave. According to NOAA data there was just minor movement.  




 I know and understand. I can see the argument from both sides. Just hope OP and everyone else can learn from what we saw. 

Thanks for the kind words stranger.

Can't believe it is actually real. 




 Gave it to myself actually. 




 Why would you act against the grain online, and not care about others finding your point of view offline offensive. You make friends with like minded people, and if they don't agree with you then they aren't friends anyways. 




 Touche 




 They can be pretty scary. 




 I did care, but i've learned not to care what other people think of me. Life is better when you live your life the way you want. Unless drugs are involved, that would probably get me in trouble. 




 You can have a private life on the internet without commenting. Yes i think anonymity is important as far as what you want see on the net, but why would you need to censor yourself for what you say? 




 Then why are they your friend? 




 This is actually a good point. Wonder if there would be a way to get around this. 




 I'm not worried about what i say, my friends and family know how i stand. Any job that fires me or won't hire me for what i say, i don't want to work there anyways. 




 Why can't you say what you want without your name attached to the comment?

I can see why if your government will punish you for your free speech.

 I probably have over a million miles driven from Santa Barbara to San Diego. I've had this happen countless times. Amazing how many times i've seen an accident like this happen. 
 




 You are absolutely right, wish i saw your comment before i started the same argument up above. 




 Without the video evidence then yes you would probably be liable for it, if there wasn't a reliable witness involved. 

With the video evidence it would still be considered a no-fault accident, and i'm sure the insurance company would sue the PT driver for causing the accident. 

Reason why dashcams are needed, wonder what OP's insurance company would say if they saw this video. 




 What would you do at the 7 second mark of the video if this was you driving? 




 Thanks for saying what i wanted to say. 




 The PT cruiser's angle of attack was too steep, it always looked like he was going to keep coming across the lanes.

Couldn't have said it better myself, thanks. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb4iFLrTeSo 




 Amazing when you learn how long a plack second is.

 









 Didn't blame the cammer, just said it was avoidable.

Edit - This is probably the first video i've seen on here that i thought was avoidable.  




 LMFAO only if you really knew me.

Edit - Thanks for the flair 




 Sounds like too much work, i am lazy. 




 I agree, but this was avoidable if OP just let of his gas when he saw cars merging ahead of him. At the 7 second mark on the video, i would have started to get into the left lane or let off the gas to see if they stay in their lane. 




 Pretty sure your insurance would be paying for both vehicles repairs, but it would be considered a no-fault accident.

Then the insurance company would try to sue the PT driver for causing the accident. 




 If you keep an eye on your mirrors and watch the traffic around you, you can keep a mental map of the traffic around you.

You don't have to predict the future, just don't expect that driver to stay in the lane they are suppose to after merging. 




 Even if you have video evidence of trying to avoid an accident? 




 Whenever i see cars merging onto the highway i will do exactly what you said. If i knew there was a car in the lane next to me, i would have let off the gas when i saw the cars starting to merge to avoid OP's situation. 




 If you keep aware of your surroundings you would know if there was a car there or not. Even so, OP had plenty of time just lay off the gas and coast to slow down when he saw cars merging. Maybe OP was in a zone and not aware of his surroundings. 

Pretty sure if he had done this, the PT would have merged in front of him without even having to touch the brakes.

Even so he has video evidence that proves he was trying to avoid an accident.  




 They probably drive just like OP. Guess growing up in LA traffic has made me more aware of other drivers. 

Even just watching the video made me want to slow down seeing the traffic merge. He practically drove into her blind spot.

Don't get me wrong, the PT is completely at fault. 

Edit - I will take the downvotes because this was completely avoidable accident.  




 If OP were to apply the brakes (not slam on them) and make a move to the left lane, that PT wouldn't have hit OP. Why is his first reaction to just honk the horn? If you are a defensive driver you would be letting off the gas and slowing down and ready to hit the brakes moments before OP just honks his horn. OP didn't even try to slow down even after he honks.

Even if there was a car in the next lane that OP hits trying to evade, he has video evidence he was trying to avoid an accident.

20 years of driving defensively i haven't been in any accidents, and have been in OP's situation many times. Don't expect other drivers to be paying attention at all times, especially when they are merging in the lane next to you. 




 Exactly how i do it. Build it hot then starve it of oxygen. Usually can leave it alone for hours only really having to open vents a lil bit of time to maintain temp. 




 Well you are the ones with the guns. 




 Only if you do it in a panic. 

hoping the impact might be a bit lighter

OP had enough time to realize what was happening for him to honk his horn, instead of making a controlled maneuver to evade. By the time the other driver has time to realize what the honk was for, OP could have got into the other lane. 




 Why didn't you try to evade him instead of honking your horn?

Edit - ~~I'm not going to try to argue this anymore~~, this accident could have been avoided if OP was a defensive driver.

edit2 - Just realized that another comment was downvoted to hell for saying the samething.

/u/Malfeasant describes [this perfectly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roadcam/comments/3ackon/pt_cruiser_owners_are_the_worst_drivers/csbiu80). If any of you have ever ridden a motorcycle you would understand.

 He had a plan to go in and shoot a bunch of people and was lucky enough to get away.

 Anyone that notices this fucktard user "massshootingagain", tag him and fuck his mom. 




 Anytime there is a crime involved in this magnitude the FBI would either take over the investigation or at least aid with all resources available. 




 I'm sorry, i am on the border of being drunk. If you were to depend on new comments with gold standards you would still have to filter through all the bullshit trolls. 




 Even though reddit is great for providing the first info, it all comes from an original source. 

For a start, [follow these local stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_in_Charleston,_South_Carolina#Major_network_television_affiliates) on all social media platforms. Then follow the hashtags would be a decent start. 




 If you need gold benefits to find new info, then you don't know how to work social media well enough. Not hard to find the breaking news if you know how to find it. 




 Even if this quote "rifle behind every blade of grass" isn't really made by Isoroku Yamamoto, it speaks the truth.

 In 1960, Robert Menard was a commander aboard the USS Constellation when he was part of a meeting between United States Navy personnel and their counterparts in the Japanese Defense Forces.
Fifteen years had passed since VJ Day, most of those at the meeting were WWII veterans, and men who had fought each other to the death at sea were now comrades in battle who could confide in each other.
Someone at the table asked a Japanese admiral why, with the Pacific Fleet devastated at Pearl Harbor and the mainland U.S. forces in what Japan had to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness, Japan had not simply invaded the West Coast.
Commander Menard would never forget the crafty look on the Japanese commander's face as he frankly answered the question.
'You are right,' he told the Americans. 'We did indeed know much about your preparedness. We knew that probably every second home in your country contained firearms. We knew that your country actually had state championships for private citizens shooting military rifles. We were not fools to set foot in such quicksand.' 




 Worse than a troll if you ask me. 




 Also live on the west coast and got home to find this thread. Granted i was in the ER an hour before this started. 




 Could be and i hope we are both wrong. 




 Isn't that what live threads are for?

 Don't remember the name of the place, this was probably at least 15 years ago. It was a guided hunting type lodge. I just did a google search for "central california boar hunting" and the first page was full of hunting lodges and related info.

 That is Vegas, why i can't figure out why he said Reno. 




 Mozgov was amazing, my new favorite russian.  




 Next highest is Eugene, but is just barely over 150k residents. I wouldn't say it was major city. I live in a city on the outskirts of LA county and has roughly the same population. 




 Reno isn't big at all, maybe he was thinking of vegas? 




 He knew there was going to be enough video to rewatch it when he wanted to.

 The CJ crowd is powerful and can make threads go to the frontpage very quickly. They don't stay there for long after it is thrown in front of the whole site which will start to downvote it.

Even comments about racism in the defaults don't stay visible for long. Just look at the whole FPH situation, right after the ban they flooded the front page quickly. When the rest of the site caught on to what happened, does that content still reach the frontpage today? 




 Reddit has seriously gone crazy in the last week. 

 




 I would probably say most of us don't. We just don't go out of our way to make that vocal.

Considering YT was launched Feb 05 




 Don't worry, i finally figured this out after about 500 hours... 




 Can you explain to us that don't? 




 It is probably a company that provides fencing for construction sites. So i would imagine it could be found almost on every single construction site.

From their website is seems they provide scaffolding so you could probably find it in several different places in the image. 




 Honestly didn't think i would find it. Figured it would have to be close to the camera and just zoomed in on the bottom left of the image. Looked at [this sign](http://i.imgur.com/e5KgeeE.png) for a minute then zoomed out a bit. When i saw that [blue/white portion](http://i.imgur.com/MNagPnR.png) i had a hunch that there was a sign on it. Couldn't believe i found it when i zoomed in to see if it was a sign.
