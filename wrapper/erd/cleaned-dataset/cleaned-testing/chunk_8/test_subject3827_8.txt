 I messaged the mods earlier about having another bingo game like at Star Wars Celebration - I made a board for it, would you consider it?

 I don't think Arndt ever had a full script, just a story treatment 




 But it's relevant to this community. 




 MakingStarWars.net 




 No, a lot of his leaks have been true before. 




 My dad, mostly. He was buying Star Wars toys for me even before I was born. 




 Post it for real so people know it's fake 




 Don't be a jerk about it, man. 




 I agree with you on the Family Guy part, but at least the Simpsons writers try. The show might not seem as good as it used to be, but that's really just because it's changed to cater to a more modern audience. Family Guy is literally just beating dead horses and making pop culture references. 




 Yeah I did that and it worked fine 




 Please /u/00-----00
 




 I know it is, but that doesn't mean a movie couldn't be coming. McGregor has expressed interest multiple times, so I don't know why Disney wouldn't do it. 




 Well, unless there is something else that would "break the Internet" like /u/00-----00 said.
 




 I think we all know the movie is coming by now 




 I think this is pretty realistic. Other than having Gwendolyn Christie and maybe Harrison Ford at SDCC, it's possible that they bring out Ewan McGregor at the end of the panel to announce an Obi-Wan movie. I think this would make up for the absence of a TFA trailer, and they could even show a teaser for the Kenobi movie, similar to what they did with Rogue One at Celebration. 




 They didn't think to mention "teaser," just trailer or clips. 




 Ah. It wont let you use the AR function unless you scan that magazine ad that was leaked yesterday. 




 I think they're saying its going to be on Google Play soon 




 Nothing's been confirmed as of now, but I bet they will. 




 Well, 4.5 of those things we know are true 




 I think it's left to right top, and then right to left bottom. 









 It was so amazing. If someone had asked me to go back the next night I definitely would have. And I probably would have wanted to go back the night after that, too. 




 Any good (Photoshop) tutorials on how to do this? All the ones I find are bad and whenever I try it turns out horrible.  




 Haha you and everyone else 




 At least he can write well - I'm sure the *idea* of the spinoff wasn't his, but the story certainly will be, and that's a good thing. 




 Yeah 




 Kinda sorta, but he would definitely make a better Indy than Han 




 I definitely don't hate him, but he's too old, doesn't look very much like Han, and really doesn't have that same charmingly arrogant quality that Han has, if you get what I mean. 




 Definitely Boba Fett, maybe Lando, and maybe Jabba. I'd love to see why Han has Jabba's bounty on his head. 




 I think anyone with common sense would rather do a Star Wars movie than a Flash movie. If anything, they'll drop out of *that*. 




 If they cast an unknown actor who can actually *act,* then we'll definitely have something to look forward to.

I hope it's not Chris Pratt. 




 But he was by Sean Connery 




 I bet that whoever they cast in this will end up being Indiana Jones as well (but that could never happen, because Indy 5 comes out the same year as this) 




 Taron Egerton, Ryan Gosling 




 Yeah but having two movies without the force (as far as we know) isn't any reason to say the studio hates the idea of the force  




 I'm sure it will be - I don't think they'd do it directly before A New Hope, or else they'd have to cast someone *really* similar looking to Ford 




 Interesting idea - I can imagine Boba would play some role in this 




 The next movie coming out literally has "the force" in the title. 




 And written by Lawrence Kasdan and his son Jon! 




 Odd choice, but they've done good work in the past - Lego Movie, Jump Street, Last Man on Earth 




 Pretty nice, though I wish you had done Nimoy as Spock in place of the "Chewie, we're home" part 




 Why would that ever happen? 




 It's just as easy as baking a cheesecake 




 Mm yes FakingStarWars the most believable news source since The Onion 




 The movie is optional. It's not the worst thing ever, but it's certainly not the best.

The series is great, however. You can either watch it in the order that it was released, or you can watch it in the chronological order: http://m.ign.com/articles/2014/03/18/star-wars-the-clone-wars-how-to-watch-in-the-right-order 




 John Boyega playing a Stormtrooper 




 I would. Star Wars is big, and there's no way this information won't get out to the public. Disney would rather put out a video of the panel in high quality than have a bunch of low quality phone recordings. 




 I think it depends on the studio and the director. I would imagine that JJ Abrams has a lot of control over what's in the Star Wars trailers, while the directors of Marvel movies probably have less input. 




 As much as I love them, there are *many* other critics who are better than them in terms of actually reviewing films. 




  I'm a biologist, not an astronomer

I read that in Dr. McCoy's voice 




 Why would they go to SDCC and show nothing? That is definitely not the place to disappoint. 




 It looks more like a Japanish one to me 




 What about the names? 




 I guess so - I can imagine we might get a plot synopsis, cause Kasdan will be there. 




 No, it really wouldn't. It gives background information of what's been going on in the past 30 years. It's not like the crawl for ESB mentioned Vader being Luke's father... 




 *George Lucas 




 Yeah but I don't see any reason why Disney would put Star Wars in a place where studious usually go all out just to tell a couple of behind the scenes stories and some pictures. 

And besides, they don't want Star Wars to be overshadowed by DC if another BvS trailer comes out - they want to be the ones breaking the records for trailer views, not their competitors.  




 Same with every other person who's claimed to have seen it... 




 Yeah 




 That was still a teaser 




 Really?? That's the movie of his you're saying is bad (which it isn't)?

Not Meet the Fockers? Ishtar? 




 ITS A TOMATO! A TOMATO DOESNT HAVE LOGIC!! 




 Now back to 9/11 




 I don't believe it. Why would they choose not to have a Marvel presence at a *comic* convention? Did they only put Star Wars there for a few behind the scenes videos? Doesn't add up.

At the very least we'll get some new information and a poster, but I wouldn't give up hope on seeing a trailer or a third teaser. 




 What about D23? 




 The EW article is in the tumblr page. Actually click the link. 




 I wouldn't give up hope completely.

Who knows? This might not even be true. At the very least we'll get some new bits of info, and maybe some behind the scenes footage of even a poster. 




 Sry m8 - just confirmed that there's no trailer at CC whatsoever 




 Damn it. Well at least we can put all the "leaks" in the garbage bin. 




 It sounds believable but you have no proof. Some of that is based on rumors, some are just things that one would logically assume. I could very easily make up something like that and have it sound true.

Not saying that it's all BS, but I'm just gonna have to take it with a grain of salt. 




 Yup - I think they'd rather have an official high quality version than a bunch of shitty phone camera ones 




 How would your friend who works in VFX know anything about the releases of the trailers, and where Rogue One takes place? I highly doubt what's shown at SDCC will be exclusive to that. 




 Totally - that and the World's Fair bit were the best parts of the movie. 




 That's awesome - I've always loved that style of drawing. 




 I bet Disney will release the whole panel online, too. That's exactly what they don't want, low quality leaks. 




 Well I would think that Disney would rather have a high quality version come out instead of a million bad-quality phone recordings. 




 The standalone movie 2 is coming 2018, I'm pretty sure.

I think the release schedule is:

The Force Awakens - Dec. 18th 2015
Rogue One - Dec. 16th 2016
Episode 8 - May 26th 2017
Standalone 2 - 2018
Episode 9 - 2019
Potential Standalone 3 - 2020 




 No - I think both Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrams realize that these new movies can't rely on nostalgic references to older movies. They're trying to get a new generation into the Star Wars world, and if they want to do that, they must put story first, and not callbacks to earlier films that the audience might not understand. 




 Jenississ 




 Says the man who starred in *Ishtar* 




 Uh huh. 




 Why? They have literally nothing to do with each other. 




 NO I HATE IT WHEN KIDS INTERRUPT MY VIEWING OF A KIDS MOVIE!!!!  




 Stop. 









 Of course it will. It's a *Marvel* movie. 




 Not that there's anything wrong with that... 




 Yeah but it's not foreign. Foreign director =\= foreign film. It has a 60.000.000 budget, is being distributed by a major (American) studio, stars American actors, and was filmed in Canada. 




 The Revenant doesn't really qualify as a foreign film though, does it? 




 Yub Nub is the shit man 




 Yeah - a lot of the rumored plot points, like Boyega being a stormtrooper, turned out to be true, even though they were talked about way before they were confirmed to be real. 




 *July 




 I think it reads like a trailer. Scenes from the film that gave dialogue about the plot? New character and location reveals? Pretty trailer-ish 




 It is, but here's my theory as to what happened.

The chocolate was originally wrapped on the outside, but they did it wrong, causing all of them to turn out like [this](http://imgur.com/Ek3DA3K)

So, they unwrapped all of them and closed them the right way, leaving most of them completely unwrapped and some of them partially wrapped in plastic, like [so](http://imgur.com/H9gMiQR) 




 No, your point is pretty simple. I would literally read absolutely nothing into it 




 The artists names maybe? 




 You know that the narration is re-recorded dialogue from Return of the Jedi, right? It's not supposed to mean anything (concerning Vader). 




 Maybe something to do with the alphabetization of the name? 




 I think it's pretty clear what it's saying, actually.  









 Tomorrowland.... 




 I still don't think it's possible to fast forward live television... 




 It's not out yet... And it's very likely that this is completely fake. 




 It's still fun to read, even if it's not real... 




 The Phantom Menace trailer has nothing to do with how good this trailer is. And the director is good, he's shown that he is. All of his movies are well-directed movies.  




 Probably fake, but awesome nonetheless. It's fun to talk about this kinda thing, even though it might not be real. 




 The Star Wars prequels are pretty boring in a lot of parts if you think about it - trade negotiations, boring scenes of sitting on couches and talking, stupid dialogue - and those still made tons of money - the same would apply to Jurassic Park (which, by the way, I don't find boring in any part).
