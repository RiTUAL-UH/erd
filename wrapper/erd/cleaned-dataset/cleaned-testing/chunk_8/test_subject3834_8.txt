 You just made me realize that for all the wheel-chair bound cripple fucks, there isn't a single handicap ramp in all of Yharnam.  Yharnam is a dick to handicapped people! 




 I tried that trick last night (was using USB becuase PS+/internet were being bitches), and I received one blood rock in 20-30 tries.  Guess RNgeezusmotherfuckeralready hates me :/


Then I got bored, and moved on to a depth 5 dungeon that had the headless bloodletting beast, and I killed him about 15 times, but nothing other than gems and chunks dropped there either :.


Will try again soon I guess.  Thanks for the info.
 




 I'd go something like 25 end, 25 STR and 50 SKL instead, for visceral damage, and because I love the burial blade and the SKL weapons in general, and your LHB can still have an ridiculous AR of 850+ even with a SKL build.  Supposedly the LHB gets slightly more AR out of STR, but the SKL weapons are much more fun imo, and unless you wanted a dedicated STR build, I feel like the SKL version has more versatility.  Either way, the above is what I would use for a skill build, whether or not you wanted to use the OP LHB, and either way the build will still remain competitive. 




 Yeah, but Evelyn spam builds are the equivelant of magic spam builds from DaS1/2.  I'd rather play the game, but some people think this is fun PvP I guess.  Even more annoying are the people who sit there spamming the shotguns.  That being said, you have to play super patient and let them run out of bullets, but I usually run out of patience and run in, and half the time I die in 2 or 3 hits from the fast rips of their Chikage.  FYI, in the last few days, I don't think I've seen a single BT build outside of reddit dungeon hizzngr.  It's pretty much the meta there, but I hardly see it elsewhere, which is nice.  And it's a shame, because I find BT builds fun to play, just not fun to play with in PvP :D 




 Were you able to get more than one blood rock from the same boss in the same chalice glyph?  I swear, I killed CE a zillion times, but I only ever got one.  I received a blood rock on my second CE kill, then I killed him another 20 times and didn't see anything, which lead me to believe that you can't get more than one blood rock from a single chalice glyph, but I would love to hear if that is possible.  How many times did you have to kill him to get more than one blood rocks?  One in 25 kills?  One in 50 kills?  Etc?  Thank you. 




 But being that most PvP fights last 20-30 seconds, there just isn't enough time for more invasions.  I really do miss the 1 v 1 v 1 or the 2 v 2s and etc. 




 Dude.  Now I want to google bloodborne porn...but I am also kind of afraid to...  I'd be all for hunter vs. doll, but with how weird the internet is, I'd probably find Rom vs. Vicar Amelia or a Snatcher :D 




 Yep.  I took a break from Bloodborne pretty quickly, whereas I couldn't put down DaS and DaS2 for a minimum of probably 5-6 months each, and even then, I came back for more, and I did it quite often.  And what game did I take a break from Bloodborne to play?  SOFS...and then vanilla DaS2 to do a full playthrough with my brother.  I'm back to playing PvP in BB, and while it's fun, I also find it very...lacking :/ 




 FYI - I went to hizzngr3 last night, and not much has changed - though I got just as much shot-gun spam as I did Evelyn spam, so if anything, it was just more annoying, but the matches seemed to come faster than Nightmare Frontier (with a toon I just pushed up to 120 from 110).  I'm thinking I'll back up my toon, then push him up to 150 to see how I like it.  Thanks for the info so far, and I appreciate your efforts to try to bring up the validity and fun of having a higher level meta to the community. 




 I think the biggest flaw when it comes to the PvP meta level discussion is that people keep trying to treat this game like Dark Souls 3, but it isn't.  Sacrafice has been important for level metas in the souls games, and it is a very valid point, but this isn't a souls game, and sacrafice doesn't mean much when we intentionally stay low level, yet farm 27% and other max level gems to kill each other in two or three hits anyway (and I don't blame people for staying competitive), but imo these have been the fundamental problems people have been complaining about for months now, as two to three shot PvP in the clunky multi-player system of Bloodborne can grow stale, samey, and the waiting periods to invade/be invaded (even with hunter's marks) usually last longer than the matches themselves.  We can't just go to a dragon or blood bro and summon them like we used to, or use a red orb to invade whereever and whenever we feel like it.


A higher meta gives us more survivability and more build options, and these have been lacking in standard meta Bloodborne PvP.  As for trying to treat this game like DaS3, let's look at what we left behind, and what the argument for a lower meta always fails to address:

 nbsp;

Weight/Armor/Poise and all that it entails:  In BB, everyone is a ninja.  There is no sacrafice here, no gear choices, no armor vs. weight, no diversity, no creativity, and no heavy armor, or light armor with better all rounded resists, and no armor with stats or buffs.  What is there in terms of resists is just short of negligible, especially when you consider fashion!

 nbsp;

Weapons - We have very few choices, and even less choices when you consider the many who flock to to stay competitive by using the two most easy to OP weapons in the game (LHB and Chikage+eve).  In past games, we had infusions, boss weapons, and all manners of options, but they were never as straightforward and OP as stacking 27% damage x 3.  There was more nuance (aside cheesy metas), but what the hell, eat my 850AR LHB or my 700AR Chikage that swings faster than a dagger!

 nbsp;

Movesets (quick vs. strong attack) - Let's be honest.  Movesets don't matter as much when it comes to PvP in this game, as most anything beyond dashes, rolls, or regular quick attacks can be easily punished in so many ways.  Sure, you might be able to sneak in the occasional jump attack or charge attack, or strong attack to mix it up, but there is a reason why people spam fast attacks:  becuase the game and the play-style of it makes it too easy to punish anything else.

 nbsp;

Buffs:  There are no survivability buffs, be it through magic, miracles, or items.

 nbsp;

Competition and game mechanics:  This goes back to what I've mentioned before and putting it all together:  We have ninja builds with no armor/weight options, no survivability buffs, less HP than ever before (especially when you are the invader), little build variety, and weapons that are easy to make ridiculously powerful, and thus the low level meta is a two to three shot, 20 to 30 seconds PvP match.  I think these are the main reasons so many people come on here to complain that the BB PvP scene is boring, stale, and has less longevity, and oh by the way, they are back to playing DaS2.


As for myself, I've come to prefer matches with healing, as they last longer than 20 or 30 seconds, and are more enjoyable and make for more thrilling fights, and with how slow and clunky multi-player can be, it becomes even more relevant.  If I PvP for a half hour, I'd prefer four or five, three to five minute matches, rather than the commonplace occurrence of eight to ten 30 second matches, with the waiting periods between the matches being longer than the fights themselves.


Edit:  I'd like to add that the two to three shot meta is also kind of frustrating, as your latency test for the other player can put you one swing away from death, and leaves little to no room for experimentation and lag.


 




 But, but, don't people like dying to Evelyn spam plus two hits from a bloody chikage?!  :P


In all seriousness, I am all for build diversity and I love the idea of expanding them, as having all of five builds is pretty lame.  And being that match-making can be clunky and slow, I am all for PvP fights lasting longer than 15-25 seconds.  I think 125 is a good meta. 




 Bloodborne is a great game to be sure, but I would have been happy with a multi-player system that didn't suck, covenants that didn't suck, and more than four "builds," becuase the lack of options and creativity sucks :/


 




 Says the thousands of people who "hated it," yet still played it longer than any other game of 2014, who played it more than DaS, and who still play it to this day.  The PvP is better and has more longevity than Bloodborne, that's to be sure, and the multiplayer in general is so much smoother and easier :D


If you're gonna talk shit about it, fine, but that's your opinion, but a lot of people still love it, and still play it, and still enjoy it, even if it isn't the best souls game in the souls series (it is still the best RPG in the souls series). 




 What have you put out into the world, from your own head, for yourself?  Thanks in advance :) 




 I have that one printed up already.  It's what I've been primarily using the last few weeks, and it's pretty great as well, thank you.  I liked the previous spreadsheet MrBrokewilly posted because it had a lot more details and info about other items and bosses you find within most of the glyphs :D 




 Ah, ok.  This was one of the questions I was definately more curious about.  Thank you. 




 Yeah.  I've done that, I usually shoot him to stagger him, then catch up and slap him around like a bitch, but I've had it that the doll puppets get in the way, or I get snagged on a corner, and etc, and the worst of it was a boring circular 10 minute chase :D 




 I think Micolash was actually a missed opportunity, as the concept is kinda cool ( a maze/puzzle boss), but it wound up lame and annoying as fuck.  It is an extremely easy fight too, but careful, because he might one-shot you.  At low insight, he would just run in circles (often not running into the first room), and occasionally jump through a mirror, and it's just not a fun fight to chase a boss in circles for 10 minutes, and then chase him some more, then have him one shot you, then rinse and repeat, and pwn him the next time around.   




 Yep.  I think it was a missed opportunity for something even greater (a creepy/puzzle/maze boss), but it wound up clunky, lame, and easy, with the occasional one-shot, which just isn't fun or challenging really, especially if you spent 10 minutes chasing him in circles at low insight :D 




 I want moar Sen's :D 




 I'll sacrafice a goat to Chemosh and hope for the best :D 




 Oooh, thanks!  Will have to try this!


Edit:  also, do you happen to know or remember what the other bosses are off-hand?  Thanks again. 




 Eh, I don't think this is the same bull-shit cliche of *"it could all or was all a dream,"* as the dreams in this game are as real as the waking world, more akin to another dimension or facet of reality.  It does make things convoluted and obtuse as you put it, but it's nowhere near as trite and obnoxious as the whole *it was all a dream* cliche.


Edit:  And while there is the curious love-craftian mechanic of insight vs. madness, it isn't as fleshed out as it could of or should have been, but at least this is one of the few love-craftian games out there with an actual Lovecraft mechanic in it (so many games miss out on this awesome opportunity).  That being said, I don't think there is much (if any) room for the "madness makes anything possible" idea, because as convoluted and obtuse as everything is, it is still fairly straight forward:  old ones, hunters, queen Yharnam, etc, are so powerful they can maintain consciousness through force of will; there are dream worlds that are as real as the waking world; the great ones exert their influence from beyond them, and the humans in the waking world try to exert their wills on bringing them through, etc.  If anything, my critique of the game is akin to yours - there seems to be quite a few contradiction in items and descriptions (not talking about the general FROM vagueness and connect the dots method, I mean straight up contradictions), and if anything, this story is more straight forward with more given answers than previous titles - I think the one thing that just trips everyone up is how weird it all is, rather than say, the consistency and repetition of fallen kingdoms and fallen gods and heroes that come to supplant them in the souls series.  Your thoughts? 




 Fire does decent damage on him (oil urns+moltovs, fire papers, etc).


You can throw blood cocktails to distract him for a few seconds (to either heal, use antitodes, or attack).


You definately want a few antidotes on hand in case you get poisoned, as it can drain your HP super quick.


To make it a sure-shot, I'd stock up on the above listed items, then use an insight to summon Alfred, and don't be stingy with your items that way you won't waste half your items and be left without the kill.  Good hunting to you  |o_ 




 That is the sweetest spread-sheet I have seen so far, but it has no info regarding boss blood-rock drop rates, or good dungeons to farm for them.  Thank you though. 




 Haha.  No sweat.  I don't blame you.  After my next and last toon that still needs to finish the story line chalices is done with them, I will probably never run a story chalice again.  Funny enough, I do enjoy the randomized chalices, as it's fun seeing the monster combos and grouping (and how totally fucking difficult they can be) at times, as well as hunting for loot. 




 Yeah - dun sweat it.  You'll catch on.  I've been a long time souls player and FROM fan, and after being familiar with all the tropes and secrets that FROM tends to put in their games, I beat this game very quickly (I didn't mean to, nor was I even playing it that much), and I found it to be the easiest and fastest game so far, once I got used to the change of pace/mechanics from previous games that is.  Given more time, you'll wonder how you ever sucked so bad in the first place :P 




 Yeah, but Destiny is one of the shittiest, shiny turds ever produced :D 




 FROM games made most action-RPG type games and MMO's feel like hello kitty's island adventure when it comes to combat.  There just isn't enough depth and weight and impact and conservation of movement and resource management to make other game's combat feel as challenging, heavy, and engaging :/ 




 As the title says, I was curious if anyone has had decent luck farming specific chalices for blood rock drops from bosses?  I have probably completed 5 to 10 depth 5 chalices on two different toons each since the patch, and so far, I think I have one blood rock drop for one toon.


That being said, the drop came from a cursed dungeon, and as such, I haven't seen a blood rock drop from a non-cursed depth 5 dungeon boss.  Can anyone else confirm whether or not blood rocks can drop from non-cursed dungeon bosses?  


Also, in regards to good chalice codes (ie, quick, easier bosses, etc) to farm blood rock boss drops from, does anyone have codes that also include mobs/bosses that drop other valuable gems - such as the high tier 27% triangle and radial gems?  Thanks in advance for your input and your replies. 




 I hear ya.  I've completed the chalices on 3 or 4 characters (with one more, my BT toon, to go), and like I said, at first it was a pain in the ass, but then I started breezing through them, so it has become less of a pain.  But what I meant was, let's say you get summoned into the defiled to get the pthumerian ihyll chalice (the one with the queen), even then, you might have the chalice now, but then you'd still have to go back and farm for materials to create that one for yourself, no?  Not to mention, if you wanted to farm specific chalices for specific loot, you'd be unable to since you lacked the root chalices. 




 Did you have to go back and farm for chalice materials then to be able to even create the chalice, then?


I mean, as much as I was annoyed at having to run chalices on toons to run depth 5 and so forth, the fact that the SRRC is a total clunky piece of shit when it comes to connecting for multi-player has made the skip options seem dubious to me.  I'd rather just run the dungeons quickly and get them over with (it doesn't take that long once you know them) than sit for 15-20 minutes at a time at some off-hand chance to even be summoned into the correct dungeon.  How long did it take you to connect anyhow?  Thanks :D 




 I agree on some points, but to be less one-sided, if you play the chalices level appropriately, they aren't as boring, and if you thoroughly explore and loot all the mandatory story chalices in order, you won't have to farm any materials at all, as you will wind up with more than enough materials to create the story chalices.


Edit: worth noting, I do enjoy exploring and seeing what challenges and enemy varieties the depth five R/F/C dungeons throw at me :D 




 Seriously man.  Read what you wrote.  You sound like you are 16 years old. I was attempting to salvage the situation, but it seems you can't even face up to what I wrote, and you obviously can't have an adult conversation about it. 


That being said, you are paranoid and delusional if you think I'd create multiple accounts to upvote myself. 




 Good point.  




 Holy shit!  Neil Young, the first hunter! 




 Hmm, maybe 125 is the sweet spot, but at that point, you'll be getting matched with 150's and higher anyhow, no? 




 Point taken, and yes it is easy to get the gems, but praisethesun is right when he points out that people keep treating this game's PvP like it's dark souls 3, when it is not. We've eliminated poise, buffs, medium armor, heavy armor, the weight system (and gear choices that it entails), and a few other odds and ends, yet what we have are weapons that do more damage than ever before, and for some reason, in a game with clunkier match making and long loading screens, it's no surprise that people are dissatisfied with the PvP experience where everyone kills each other in 2 to 3 hits.  




 Yep. My uncanny BB is siting at something like 650-700 AR with those gems (and those are the weaker gems, not the highest you can go) which still isn't as much as my uncanny LHB that is at 850 with plain old 26-27% gems in it, but I prefer BB for PvP anyhow, and it has and takes a lot more finesse :D


Edit - worth mentioning that you can get lots of blood chunks and the exact gems you need for the uncanny BB and regular BoM (killing 2 birds with one stone) by farming layer 1 chalice bosses. Just look up the appropriate glyphs.  




 Diversity?  We only have five builds in this game... but you do bring up some good points :) 




 I have yet to try the 150 pvp meta, but I love the idea of it, as there are only five builds in this game, and what the hell do our 'unique' (one of five) builds matter when anyone running the current standard meta can kill each other in two to three hits?  PraiseTheSun has a point - trying to keep a low level meta of mid-game level, yet wielding the very end of game 27% damage gems is pretty ridiculous. 




 I don't.  Get an uncanny burial blade and fit in three +8-9% physical damage with +60-70 flat arcane damage gems :D  




 Well, in DaS, there is the brilliant writing that was snuck in there from Oscar (who gives you the estus flask) in the beginning, right before he dies:  he says, 'perhaps you can continue my chosen undead quest to ring the bells, and *keep the torch lit so to speak.'*.  Big allusion to the whole kindling the flame thing, but even then, he is handing us his quest, and the answer is right there, hidden in plain sight.


We go to Yharnam, and we are faced with a similar mysterious dilemma, though we actually know our character was there to seek paleblood (as reiterated by the blood minister).  The difference is, if anything, our PC in BB has a motivation, even if we don't know anything about it, though in DaS, our toon was just rotting in a cell until Oscar came and freed him, and later gave us his quest.  The point is, they are equally mysterious, and equally vague, though I can see why you would think what you think.

With DaS, Oscar is someone else putting their quest on us, and in BB, we have a quest, we just don't seem to remember much (or know much about it) in the first place.  And just as well as DaS is written with that information in plain-sight, BB is written well too, as I think the blood minister gives us the biggest clue of all:  "Where's an outsider like you to begin?  With a bit of *Yharnam* blood of your own."  Dude is straight up injecting us with the dead queen's blood (the same blood that has corrupted all), and thus begins our mysterious adventure to keep the torch lit, I mean, seek the paleblood.


But I'd agree, but I don't think it is the story itself that it is lacking.  It is the...movement and timing maybe?  I don't know how to put it, but it does feel a bit jumpy or off at times, but to me, it also sort of suited the cosmic horror nature of the game.  Maybe it was the whole 'hi gothic horror adventure, holy shit SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER SPACE SQUIDS!!1!' thing that threw you off? 




 Wow.  And you are a clear example of a presumptuous, jump down your dick internet asshole who decides to be hostile and ridiculously aggressive for no apparent reason, other than, fuck you, I guess?  As if I somehow had threatened the core of your existence?  Why are you so sensitive dude? (and I mean that seriously).  

 nbsp;

Did vaati kill your mother and copy your work too?  I mean, it's ok, we all have our own dispositions, and I'm sensitive too, but I try not to come out the gate foaming at the mouth, calling people douche bag for their opinion, making assumptions about what they believe, and in general acting like a total cunt.  Sure, in the post you responded to, I said 'I think OP is being hypocritical,' and he was being hypocritical.  He made the post (only to delete it later) to make a knee-jerk claim that his content was stolen before he even confronted the person in question about it, and then he tells other not to act so knee-jerkingly after he started the shit in the first place?  How is that not hypocritical?

 nbsp;

And speaking of word usage, I find it pretty damn funny that you bring up how irrelevant word usage is, while the very root behind the subject at hand is the particulars of language that FROM uses in their games - and that language makes all the difference in these games, as well as in real life and art and language and poetry and everything else.  You discount the power of words, here of all places?  That's pretty goddamned ridiculous, so don't tell me that words and semantics don't matter, though I suppose you might be one of those people whose words don't mean shit to them, because they don't value their own word, honor, or integrity.  But I don't know.  So far you've yelled at me like an asshole, but I don't know where you stand with integrity and honor.

 nbsp;

Lastly - I don't know about you, but I don't care for drama queens.  I'm too old for that shit, and too old for random internet asshole arguments too, but I'll entertian this all a bit more:  if your wife/GF/SO thought you were cheating on her (whether it was true or not) would you rather her,

A) confront you in private first, and discuss it there first before jumping to conclusions?  or

B)  Kick in the door to a family and community party or event, and have her accuse you in front of everyone?

 nbsp;

Because OP did B.  He did option B with little no no proof.  To be fair, OP did credit a bunch of people in his essay (as one should, and no, I am not cool with plagiarism), from anonymous users who helped him come to his final conlusions, and people who helped him put it all together, so at least he has that going for him.  And to be thorough, I also threw out the names of other "original" content creators in other posts, so chill out with your assumptions.  You know it's not a bad thing that there are say, more than one band making original music, or one artist making one kind of art, or one director making movies, or one DeS/DaS fan making fan videos, right?  Sure, give credit where credit is due - to the originals and to the people who helped set the bar and garner interest in a field and who pioneered something, but it doesn't mean that it has to or should stop there.... 




 Yep.  I never realized how much I'd miss boss-soul weapons, the clunky upgrade paths of DaS1 or even the simplified infusions of DaS2.  It was never as OP as say, damage +27% x 3, and at least you had different classes of armor (as well as buffS) that could counter those harder hitting weapons and spells anyhow.  (And few seem to take this into consideration compared to level metas in previous games:  that we used to have poise, armor that had weight vs. defences vs. elemental resists, rather than mostly fashion, etc)


I can sort of see from a design view, since there were so few weapons, they wanted to make them more customizable, but RNG gem farming (or any farming for that matter) isn't the best game design or use of a player's time imo.  Off hand though, I'm not sure how they could have achieved said customization, aside carrying over some form of infusions, or maybe just have less gem slots.  And then there is balancing for PvE and PvP as well, so I'm not sure how that would have looked with infusions either, but I digress.  I'll back up my save in the days to come and try out this 150 meta.


And here are a few last questions for you - what is your actual vitality at on your 150 toons?  And what does that total health pool look like?  Do you use it with or without health runes?  


And have you tried any other PvP hot-spots with the level 150 meta?  If so, which one is the best with consistent and frequent match-making?  I don't want to feel like I am stuck in nightmare frontier for an eternity.  It'll be like the iron keep bridge all over again :D


Edit:  The more I think about this, the more it makes sense.  People keep clinging to the point of builds and the sacrafice we make for them (which has always been important in these games), which does have merit, but they totally fail in the lower meta argument in every other regard since they dismiss the fact that we no longer have poise, armor weights (and the sacrafices we made for gear choices), better armor and elemental resists, magical buffs, and instead of simple weapon upgrades and infusions, what we do have are gems that make us do ridiculous damage.  


Besides, there are only four builds in this game (five if we include quality as a build in itself, which we can and should), but aside pure lower level builds, a lot of builds still dip into secondary stats anyhow (Ie, STR usually has some SKL, BT usually has some SKL for untransformed chikage, etc), so it's not like we are going overboard anyhow, or making our toons be masters at everything.  I think people really are comparing BB to the Souls games too much, and trying to treat it as more of the same is gimping the gameplay. 




 Yeah, but DaS and BB were both very specific with item placement, and there were usually specific reasons as to why items were where you find them, or why you receive items from specific enemies (not including RNG chalices).  And being that they specifically make Caryll out to be a mystical genius, it seems kinda odd that all of a sudden, any old asshole can now understand and create runes.  So far, I don't think it is due to randomized item drops, I just think it was oversight on their behalf in the item descriptions :D 




 Yep.  And a lot of us enjoy a good, challenging and more evenly matched fight.  If I was to say, co-op with a friend that I was much higher level than, I would either use a completely un-upgraded weapon, or fight with my bare hands to make it more on par, but I have yet to do that anyhow :D 




 Bingo.  He was constantly rooted in place due to the slow recover time, and I was constantly getting flinched by buckshot in my crotch.  Either way, was one hell of a party.  It was satisfying once I pinned him to a wall and shredded him with my saw spear.  From there, it took about 5 minutes of wandering to finally even find the host (as it was for a co-op round).  RIP Papa G 




 Ah, bloodborne huh? 




 You're only a week late, but to be thorough, I didn't say he IS a dick.  I said he is being a dick about this.  Apparently he agreed to to some degree, as he deleted his post. 




 In regards to the previous posts on this topic about level metas, I do think you're right about one thing - it is kind of oxymoronic that people want to cap their builds at 75-100, yet farm for the 27% gems.  Between the clunky multi-player and the loading screens, I don't understand why people enjoy this as much as they do.


At that point, if you're going to use the highest gems, why not bring up the meta to 125-150, that way people won't be dieing in 2-3 hits?  Or why not stay 100 but use no gems, or why not level to 150, and not use any gems there either, even though that winds up being more like a war of attrition...
 




 Yeah, I whomped a dude last night who just kept spamming his blunderbuss.  I usually see pistols and evelyn's more than the shot-gun spread weapons, but those pellets are obnoxious when they make you stutter, and yet, brings no real advantage because not either him nor I him could do anything about it with a follow up attack... 




 The coolest thing is that you can make an awesome SKL build that still can rock LHB for 800+ AR, and still utilize the BB to max potential.  




 You don't need arcane to be more than 15 if you just want to use the tools, as the BoM and BB get squat for damage from arcane. You just have to gem them properly, which are the +physical damage/+flat arcane damage gems. Both weapons are monsters once you socket them correctly. 

Edit: you just need 18 arcane for augur. And if you make the build right, you can sit at around level 100-110 and also rock LHB for shit tons of damage too, while still having 50 SKL for good visceral damage.  




 I think it is the Queen's blood, and with FROM's history of hiding answers in plain-sight, I think the blood-minister in the cutscene tells us exactly what we are taking:  "Where's an outsider like you to begin?  With a bit of *Yharnam* blood of your own."  After all, the city is named after her, and it sprung up around Laurence and the healing church he founded.  


The rest of my theory is conjecture:  that the great one's blood is indeed pure, hence, there are some pthumerians who didn't go full beast, but once you start ingesting second-rate, second-generation blood, enter super PMS beast mode! 




 DaS2:  "*You will stand before the gates of the kindom, without even really knowing why."*  -The Firekeeper Narrator at the beginning of DaS2.  


This is a fairly accurate description of pretty much every FROM game - we have vague ideas of what's going on, and we have to find our own purpose within the complex web of events that happened or are going to happen.  My PC was motivated in BB.  I wanted to know what the hell was going on, but the story is and was, I was being duped and puppeted by others, until I said fuck this and ate some aborted babies and then killed the moon prescence and transcended into a squid.  Take that bitch-ass MP! 




 Another thing I see tossed around loosely:  the original blood/medium used for ministration, and the time-line about the city of Yharnam itself.  Please correct me if I am wrong:


We know the story pretty much started with the discoveries at Byrgynwyrth, and the split came when Laurence left to pursue the power of blood (and founded the church), but the issue I have is that I see everyone talk about it as if Laurence set up a church in Yharnam, whereas, I'm pretty sure that several in-game item descriptions indicate that Yharnam pretty much sprang up around Laurence and the healing church.  Hell, it's even named after the Pthumerian Queen, which would be a hell of a coincidence if it was founded before Laurence got there to found the church.  The other thing I mentioned, is the medium itself.  I think the beast plague comes from second-rate blood.  Byrgynwyrth/Laurence didn't find unadulterated kin or great one blood imo, they found incestuous Queen Yharnam blood.  Given FROM's history of hiding things in plain-sight, the original doctor tells us exactly what he is giving us:  *"some Yharnam blood of our own."*  The transfusion we are given is the same corrupt blood of Queen Yharnam that everyone else has been using.


Again, just like the seeming continuity error I mentioned on my previous post on this topic, I see these details glossed over or mixed-up constantly, and I'd like to see it cemented in place if it is true, or thrown out (all if possible) if it isnt.


Your thoughts?

 




 Someone once pointed out that Wilhem indeed wants you to kill Rom, hence he points at the lake - he wants Rom to no longer hide or block the ritual(s), the implication being that he wants you to see the madness for yourself to stop it, and this goes back around to the Bygynwerth/church split, as we know Wilhem wanted to stop experimenting with blood, hence he wants you to stop the church/choir/mensis.  All the notes about 'the spider hiding rituals' seem to coincide with this, as he is directly keeping the red moon at bay, and the summoning of the one reborn.  But if you interpret all that slightly differently, there is another possibility that the choir (that's why the hunter is there guarding wilhem) placed Rom where he is, so it could hide their dark rituals from the rest of the populace, and as you suggested, the events in Yahur Guhl could just coincide with time passing.  I believe the former, not the latter, but the latter would still make sense in certain context.


I always thought Rom looked more like a caterpillar than a spider.  Also, we get kin blood from him, not great one.  I was thinking that Rom is possibly kin, yet to evolve into an actual great one.  I was also thinking that the husk-like fossil thing in the choir church that Ebriatis is at, could possibly have been her husk, but that wouldn't make much sense, since she was already 'the great one who was left behind or abandoned,' so it wouldn't make sense if she metamorphisized later...


edit:  In answer to your other question, if wilhem did indeed create or summon or place Rom where he is to stop the mensis/choir/church rituals and practice, it wouldn't be inconsistent per se, as Rom is seemingly just a band-aid to the problem, a temporary fix, and not a final and actual solution, so Wilhem's desire is that you put a full stop to it, rather than rely on his temporrary solution.


Ahem, I think we only have more questions now... 




 But we don't know if she gave birth to a great one in the times of ancient Pthumeru, do we?  What we know is she is dead, and it seems the great ones descended in current times to impregnate her, because like the hunters and gherman and Mic Cage, she can retain consciousness by force of will. 




 One seeming continuity error that annoys me in game is the description that says *"master wilhem would have been proud of Caryll's runes,"* implying that Wilhem never got to see the fruit of Caryll's work, yet, Wilhem is in possession of the eye Rune.  Worse still, in all the biggest lore posts and videos, I've never seen that seeming error mentioned.  I've heard that same description of 'wilhem would be proud' quoted, and all manners of things related to them, but I have yet to see anyone say 'there is a discrepency here.'


Your thoughts? 




 Yeah.  I shouldn't have used duct tape :/ 




 Is it a caccoon casing?  For all we know it is a husk of her caccoon, though I don't know why it has the name it has, or why it is where it is per se.  As OP said, it is very similar to Ron the Funky Caterpillar... 




 Yep, though the initial transform attack into the 2hand version is too slow  




 Heal Problems?  Learn to toss numbing mist vials to keep them from healing, toss poison daggers, or learn to shoot and interupt and/or parry+visceral the heals.

Learning to parry?  Time your reactions better.  Don't blindly shoot and cancel out your own parries, and don't be so jumpy that you dodge backwards or sideways every time you shoot, as you might have gotten a parry (lag) and need to dodge forward to follow it up with a visceral 




 Eburietasu-son say, *"SUDOKU!"* 




 If you've cleared the chalices (or are at least to the depth 4 story chalices), just put on a moon rune or three and use a hunter's mark to clear a room or two in some of the depth 4 to 5 dungeons, rinse, and repeat.  You can have millions of blood echoes in 15-30 minutes. 




 SHUT UP TOM GIT GUD SKRUB!


Just kidding.  Yeah, there are some great people here, and there are also plenty of unnecessarily hostile, jump-down-your-throat-for-no-reason type ding-bats here that will defend their angry, insecure dellusions to the death, so don't be too discouraged when you find the typical internet assholes crawling out the wood-work  :D

Good hunting to you o/ 




 Don't give up skeleton!  I mean, pull the lever!  Wait, what's going on again? 




 Yep.  Very linear and short, though the awesome level design helped hide that in BB :| 




 The runes and rocks I have experienced, but I have never seen a blood chunk in a chalice dungeon, aside the recent post patch boss drops, and the one time a gargoyle happened to drop one :/ 




 To be thorough though, bloodtinge builds are really fun to play imo, even outside PvP.  Besides.  We only have four or five builds at most in this game, so I can't really blame anyone for using one quarter of the options available to us... 




 I know journalism typically appeals to a four to eighth grade reading level, but aside being a general skrub, it's a sin to use the words *getting* and *like* in professional writing  :D 




 And BB doesn't?  All that cooperation with Sony and they couldn't set up a little something for FROM for BB?  That's a bummer, but even then, I don't see why they couldn't have just morphed the summon signs to messengers that sat there ringing the bells for you, that way you could still easily and classically find a summon bell messenger (red or white for pvp and pve), activate it, and expect and know that most of the times without fail, that person you just summoned will be coming into your world, rather than, *I'm wasting an insight to ring a bell, then hope and wait for someone to show up, and half of the time, it just fails out, and I have wasted 10-15 minutes of my play time, or even longer with less success when it comes to the SRRC* 




 Yeah.  I hate the way multi-player in general works in this game.  It worked so smoothly in DaS2, and even more smoothly in DaS by comparison, and I don't see how or why it was such a step backwards for BB :( 




 I had previously never seen a blood chunk come from a CD's treasure chests or tombs, and I still haven't, but I have received a lot of chunks from layer 1 and 2 bosses in depth 4-5 dungeons :D

edit: clarity 




 I could say no based on my experience, as one of my toons who had previously looted a blood rock from a chest in one of each dungeon type received a blood rock from a layer 3 boss in a depth 5 dungeon. 


Edit: worth noting, I don't know how rare the blood rocks drop rate is, as I've cleared maybe 4 or 5 depth 5 dungeons between the toon I mentioned and another toon post patch, and I've only seen the one blood rock drop so far.  




 For sure.  I know if I was a new player to the souls/borne franchises, it'd be more akin to the wonder of our first trips through DeS and DaS, so the familiarty and suspicion made the game less intimidating, though I still found my first playthrough very engrossing, and the atmosphere is superb to be sure.


I agree with you about the armor thing being liberating, I really do, especially compared to how wonky and undependable poise wound up being in DaS2, but I still appreciated that being light weight meant you had to sacrafice stats and gear to move fast, and it wasn't a simple matter of aesthetics.  And while I appreciate the fashion options without having to upgrade all your armor to stay competitive, I actually think upgrading armor would be a good option to counter how ridiculously powerful the blood gems are in BB's PvP.


Armor choices aside, (besides pure fashion), and aside when plenty of us say fashion  stats,  armor wasn't just a matter of choosing stats carefully, it was (and still is, DaS2 pvp is pretty great) also choosing gear more carefully.  Sure, no weight in BB is cool, and being able to equip a weapon in 2 slots on each hand w/o weight is great, but even that is a step backwards from DaS2 where we could have three on each hand, though managing that could be clunky or weigh you down too much, but it was still an option that a lot of people used.  


But all that being said, I think I might be using the wrong lens to appreciate BB (at least, the end game/pvp) for what it is.  Just like while DaS2 was not the best Souls game, it was and is the best RPG (and pvp) game in the series.  Instead of trying to look at BB like more of the same, I feel like I should look at it like others haev suggested - almost more like a fighting/arcade game.  While I don't agree with the 150 meta per se that these same people have mentioned, they do have a point that it intentionally plays very differently.  I welcome 'differently,' but it is hard to enjoy it when differently winds up being limited, and definitely more limited than the previous FROM game. 




 Biased how?  Like I said, I think BB is a master-piece of a game, and I guarantee nothing will come close to this game for the rest of 2015, at least as my personal favorite of the year, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have its faults.


The game itself is actually very linear.  There are only a handful of optional areas that people can miss, but that doesn't make it any less linear.  And while you can skip those along with a boss or two in the main game, it is all still very straight-forward, as you always start and end in the same place.  Again, the awesome level design hides this fact very well.  I know we could talk about the story chalices here, but again, those are very linear, and I don't think they are designed well enough to be able to talk about them as if they are some solid content, or at least, in the same category as the main game.


As for the armor, while most of it looks very cool, and it does have stats, most of it is comparable, besides a few odd instances where you might want frenzy resist or lightning resist.  As you know, the important difference is that past games had poise, and different classes of armor with weights that complimented different builds, and thus, on top of a lot of fun weapon options, you also had your fashion/armor options, which played very differently, from light and fast, to medium and versatile, to heavy and slow like a tank.


At first I thought it was cool that everyone in BB was a ninja fast hunter, but I didn't realize how much this lack of armor variety would truly kill the creativity, versatility, and build options.  Couple this with the fact that were are so few weapons (even if they are all pretty awesome), and the fact that we have four to five stat builds at most to use, and then you see how the game is super limited in variety, and the PvP plays very samey, even if you make one of each build (as I have).  Sure, there is a big differene between how BT plays vs arcane or quality, but still, even then, it can become fairly redundant.  


As for myself, I never realized how much I'd miss boss weapons and excessive weapons (even if a lot were samey, a lot of them were still unique) until I was sated on Bloodborne :/ 




 Yes - I've made several PvP characters as well, and to be able to complete the quests I want, get the items I want, and level what I want, it still only takes a few hours.  A little over two or three hours for the main game, and another two hours (probably a bit longer) for the chalices - which is really damn fast when you think about it, and it is super easy once you have the know-how, but that's the way it goes with all the souls games once you figure them out.  Of course, on my first play-through I took my time, and explored a lot and so forth, but even then, the game seemed surprisingly short, and being familiar with FROM's tropes and way of hiding things, BB just fealt supremely easier once I was accustomed to the mechanics.  It was even easier on subsequent playthroughs, and even the cursed mechanic isn't much of a bother anymore.  I'm sure a new player to FROM games would not agree though.


Of course, building new toons for PvP isn't as fast as a true speed-run, but it can still be done very fast, and depending on someone's play-time, it can be done in a few sessions, and even less if you don't bother to farm for the 27% and other top-tier gems, which aren't even necessary depending on the weapons you use, as you can still two to three shot a lot of people with the main game gems.


Here's hoping the DLC brings some much needed variety and multi-player options to the game :D 




 What bias?  I said this game is a master-piece, it's just severely limited in quite a few areas, especially one of the most important in any of FROM's game:  the multi-player.  

As for the difficulty, I suppose you didn't see the 'relative to other Souls game part (especially for people who aren't new to the series),' but then again, that has been the point in all these games.  Sure, they can still deliver an ass-whooping, but once you learn them, they become significantly easier.  As for my critique of this great game, I was dissapointed at how short and linear BB is, though the awesome level design hid that fact well.  From there, the multi-player system is stupid and clunky, the SRRC is terrible, PvP invasions are extremely limited and the health penalties are asinine.  The covenants are also lame as fuck.  I could go on, but that is a good place to stop.  Still a great game, I just wish they had more time to make it even better.

 Actually, compared to the other souls games, BB is pretty short and easy, and once you've run through it once, it is fairly easy to take a character through pretty much the entire game in an hour or two.  The chalices slow you down, but if you speed run those, you can still be done with them in short order.  A good defence of the changes FROM made to co-op, is simply to say, it's cool that they let friends and people have fun summoning each other, because I'd wager that just because someone can summon a high level into their game, a lot of new and low-level players won't be summoning high levels in to beat the cleric beast for them, simply because it takes premeditation, and not everyone plays these games in group or co-op at all.


Point is, this game is already easy and short and limited in every aspect that has made FROM games great: builds, variety, armor that is more than fashion, covenants, and a better multi-player experience for PvE and PvP.  It is a msterpiece to be sure, but fairly dissapointing in a lot of regards (not talking about the FROM hype either).  I am fine with them opening up the game a bit to let friends play with each other online easier.  Now, if they'd only fix a myriad of other fundamental problems with this game, like the SRRC, or covenants, or the stupid invasion system and its penalty... 




 I hate that stupid light on the controller.  It creates unnecessary glare, and it makes it harder to spook myself in the dark  




 Just did another 5 runs of pwmf22gu, and nothing more than 25% gems...

edit:  and a 6th one yielded a lvl19 27%.  Woohoo! 




 HookerFolio 




 Winnie like The Pooh?  Or whinny like a horse?  Or winning like Charlie Sheen? 




 Right, but even the higher % attack gems still give crap returns on the crap arcane stats on BB and BoM.  Those weapons are min-maxed with the +physical gem w/ flat arcane damage, and that is how you optimize those weapons' split damage.  What annoys me is it is still a lot more work to get usable gems for those weapons, than say, throwing in a few easy to aquire 20%+ physical gems in weapons like ludwig's or the chikage, and even worse is trying to get the best arcane gems :/ 




 I can see the wonder of it all now:  the static bell maidens summon maidens that then summon more maidens that summon spiders. You spawn into a chalice dungeon, and wonder why the floor is red and sparky, only to realize that the floors and walls and all the enemies are now made out of red spiders. You go to flick the lamp to escape, but the lamp was really a summoned red spider all along. YOU DIED.  




 BoM and BB aren't meant to get their best damage and best AR's off the arcane stat, as it scales like shit, and is built by that design.  The damage is split with the weird scaling because you min/max those weapons with the +phys damage gems with the +flat arcane damage gems, and that is how you get 600 AR+ on BB and BoM's. 




 150 means we wil have two or three builds, instead of four or five.  This game is already severely lacking in options, variety, and creativity when it comes to PvP, and as stream-lined and as fun as it could be, I think it is unnecessary.


Edit:  worth noting on the BoM discussion.  The BB and BoM weapons aren't meant to get their damage from Arcane stat scaling - they get their best damage off the +phys % with +flat arcane damage gems, as they both attack fast and can really dish out the numbers when gemed appropriately... 




 As others have said, Ludwig's Holy blade is sort of seen as the go-to newb weapon, as you can find it early in game, and it is easy to pump up the damage on it relatively quikcly.  I never even picked it up until my third or fourth character in, and I gotta admit, I see why it is the go-to weapon - it is extremly powerful, you can pick it up fairly early, it scales well with both STR and SKL for either type of build (or a more balanced quality build at like 35/35, but I prefer to specialize and pump at least one to 50), you can enchant it with papers, and it is easy to get that thing to 600+ AR, whereas other weapons involve a whole lot more gem farming (specially arcane, or the other SKL weapons with optimal gems) to really max out the potential AR. 


That being said, Ludwig's will be your go to when you really are having trouble with a boss, or want to sort of smash your way through everything.  For a bit more finesse, and to vary up your play-style to keep things interesting, if you do go for a SKL build, then you'd want blades of mercy, and my favorite, the burial blade.  There is also the cane, but I can't stand the weapon's AR, moveset, or anything about it (just my opinion though).  Again, Ludwig's is easy to fall back on, because to get the best AR and gems on the BoM and BB, you need an uncanny burial blade (triangle slot instead of waning), and you need to farm gems with %physical damage plus flat arcane damage (ie, +9% physical damage, +65 flat arcane damage).  These weapons have lower base AR's, but a little innate arcane damage, but they hit quick, so between the physical and the arcane, if you gem them right, you can easily have 300+ physical damage and 300+ arcane damage per hit.  That is a lot on the burial blade, and especially the blades of Mercy since they hit super quick :D


If you went STR, you are dealing with slower weapons (though even the slow weapons in this game are fairly fast).  You have the axe with decent AR, but it is the awesome, versatile, crowd-mangling 2hand moveset that really makes it shine.  There is the wheel, which is very... different, but I couldn't get into, no matter how hard I tried (worth checking out though).  The stakedriver is fun, and it definitely takes more finesse and timing than a lot of other weapons, and lacks reach, and finally, there is the hammer, which I wanted to like, but honestly, between a lot of the terrible camera angles, I often found my entire character, the enemies, and half the screen being blocked by the giagantic hammer that was slung over my shoulder, and I just couldn't play the game like that.  But with all that being said, it is definitely worth trying them out to see which ones you like best, and from there, you could try to see where you'd like to take your build.  There are a few other weapons I didn't mention, but the ones I mentioned are the most popular and versatile ones.


Worth noting, for a standard level 100-120 build for Co-Op and/or PvP, you want at least 40 vitality for health (especially due to co-op/invader -30% health handicap), 20 endurance (though I prefer 25, as 20 won't even give you every weapon's full 3 to 4 hit combo), and a primary damage stat at around 50.  Blood tinge should be ignored unless you are making a blood tinge build, and arcane should be at 15 if you want to use the hunter's tools, but no higher unless you are making a full arcane build.  Hope this helps.

Edit:  typos/clarity

Edit 2:  To be clear, I'm pretty sure you're right about LHB being top dog for damage.  Other weapons might have more versatile move-sets, be quicker, or be more engaging or challenging to use, but in terms of raw damage especially with being able to be enchanted, I'm pretty sure Ludwig's is the highest damage weapon in game. 




 Oh yes!  This one too! 




 Even with a B/B scaling in STR and SKL, supposedly Ludwig's Holy Blade gets slightly more AR out of STR than skill, so for a quality type build (which you already have), I'd leave either STR where it is, or SKL where it is, and max one of them up to 50 for your primary damage stat.  Personally, I prefer SKL weapons in this game (namely for a particular end of the game weapon), and SKL also increases the damage of your visceral attacks, so in general, I feel like SKL  STR in terms of general usefulness in BB, never mind the slightly slower attack speeds of a lot of STR weapons (though they still wreck).


That being said, my original toon was a STR build, and I had a lot of fun with it and really loved the hunter's axe, but my main toon for PvE/PvP is a 25 STR / 50 SKL /15 Arcane (for tools) SKL type quality build that is capped at level 110. 




 Cool.  So there is hope, huh?  I was mainly wondering if I was wasting time still looking to get lv 19 gems from said bosses, since I oddly didn't see one drop after an hour+ of farming last night, whereas, the night before I received several in quick succession.  Thanks for your input, and damn you RNJesus! 




 It's the ghost of Gwynn! 




 Yes yes yes.  And worthwhile PvP covenants, and an arena, and better conenctivity, and better summong/invading options period. 




 I know a lot of people tested this, but part of me thinks it was all in people's heads all along :P 




 As I said in an above reply, I don't have a large enough pool of accurate data, and RNG is stupid like this, but I found it odd that I received several 18 (or is it 19?) gems in a short time pre-patch, and post patch I didn't pick up a single 18 or 19 gems in a similar amount of boss kills.  Could have just been opposite RNG day.  Will try some more tonight.  Thanks for your input. 




 Yep...  wish they could have come up with better or different rewards for the chalices, and different ways of upgrading your weapon aside gems...  Also, I hate the sloppy way they are organized in my inventory, and I hate searching through a massive pool of gems :D 




 Yes.  Yes I did.  Editing it now.  Thank you :) 




 Yeah.  I just found it odd that after at least getting a few 27% gems fairly quickly pre-patch, I didn't even get one within a similar amount of time of farming post patch. 




 Yes!  After being sated with BB in such a short time, SOFS totally engaged and engrossed me, which I didn't expect it too, at least for PvE, but it did, and I had already played DaS2 vanilla/DLC to death in both PvE and PvP from last year.


 You'll notice a lot of different mechanics at play, more character stats and abilities to figure out, but the best thing is that the multiplayer is infinitely better than how slow and clunky the multiplayer in BB is, for both PvE and PvP :D


Edit:  As others have said, it is worth playing DaS as well, and DeS if you have a PS3.  

Edit (added more): Out of DaS1/2, DaS is the better souls game, but take the whole *DaS2 is the worst* opinion with a grain of salt, because it is still a great game and people love hyperbole.  In fact, DaS2 it is the best RPG with the best PvP in the series, it just isn't the best SOULS game in the series :) 




 So, the day before the patch I had farmed up quite a few 27% physical damage triangle and radial gems quick and easy from the popular chalice glyphs many people use (5pwujscd for triangle and pwmf22gu for radials), and I was pretty much swimming in 27% damage gems.  In fact, I don't think anything less than 27% even dropped.


Last night I ran quite a few boss kills on both those glyphs (mostly pwmf22gu though) for 27% gems one of my lower level PvP toons, and I didn't see a single 27% gem drop.  At most, I received a few 25% gems.  Now, I didn't go about it in the most scientific manner or track the drops well or anything, but has anyone else who keeps better tabs on these things noticed a change in the drop rates of blood gems?  Did they make the 27% gems more rare?  I plan on running some more tonight, but until then, has anyone had similar experiences?  Can anyone confirm or deny?  Is it just RNJesus magic?  Thanks in advance for your replies. :)

Edit:  had wrong triangle glyph listed. 




 Yes.  Yes I did.  Anyway.  Drop me a line sometime.  We should totally play some bloodborne. 




 Uhhh, did you miss the joke? I was saying you didn't belong here because you weren't acting like a bitchy, over-reactive, self-righteous, self-important, cynical and life-hating, reddit dick-head...
