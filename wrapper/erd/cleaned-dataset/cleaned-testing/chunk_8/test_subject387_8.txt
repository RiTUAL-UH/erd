 Thank you very much! 




 Whoa, nice set ups. That switch-Axe Kick was sick. Nice Find! Thank you. 




 If glutes and hamstrings are the primary muscles used in the Axe-Kick, wouldn't focusing on Squats directly increase the power of an Axe Kick? 




 Deadlift primarily works on lower back muscles, right? 

How does that translate into power for the Axe Kick? 




 Enough money will corrupt you eventually. 




 It was a counter-punch. He blocked his opponent's roundhouse kick and used a reverse punch at the same time. 




 I agree! Btw, If I may ask, what is exactly is "ITF-ish"? 




 Oh my gosh, thank you so much for your detailed advice! I will definitely practice these tips on my BoB tomorrow. For the reference - I do WTF-Style Taekwondo which, as you know, does not allow head punches so I will have to try feinting in. Any types of feints you would recommend? I really want to practice Hug's Spin Kick Feint to Axe Kick combo.

Once again, thank you very much! 




 I consider myself a martial artist, but I don't consider myself a "spiritualist" nor am I "spiritual" at all. Those two terms are not and should not be assumed to be associated with each other.  




 Great article by the way! Thanks for sharing. 




 Can it be attributed due to innovations of technology that allow us to accurately diagnosis cases, in which may not have been diagnosed in the past due to limitations on technology or just plain out factors that we still have yet to fully grasp - environmental, genetic defects, etc. ? 




 What I usually do is throw a couple of Roundhouse Kicks to the body have them thinking about that motion. Then, I'd do an Out-To-In Axe Kick which initially follows the same motion as the back leg Roundhouse Kick and then dropping it over my opponent. If it misses the head, it will hit the body. The Axe Kick, in my opinion, is a kick that covers one of the greatest amounts of range amongst all kicks.

I can't tell if Hug is hitting with heel or the ball of the foot, either or - the most important thing, it seems, is after getting the technique down - the timing.

I'm going to be honest and say I spam a lot of Axe Kicks. I'm going to stop using them so excessively in order to heighten my chances of nailing a really good one and dropping my opponent. 

Just throwing an axe kick without any strategy isn't going to end well.

Right on. It seems to work well as a jam/cancel/trap attack so I'll try working my Axe Kicks on the motion.

 Wow good eye spotting that Hug utilized the Axe Kick to cancel his opponent mid-attack. Do you ever utilize the Axe Kick in sparring, personally? 



















 NAPPA DIDN'T SAY OVER 9000 YOU FUCKER 




 What the fuck. 




 /s. 




 That would be breaking the fourth wall, dude. 




 Oh I didn't know you could watch it live! Yes! Now I can support my dojang from the comfort of my own room. 




 Forgive me if this is not the proper subreddit for it, but I figured with all the active users - one can enlighten me on whether or not the fighters were at the same weight or if they met catchweight or if there were no weight classes at all in this fight. 




 Never would've thought there are Redditors that rival the perverts on 4Chan. 




 A lot of people, including the coaches at my own dojang, will religiously remind their students to keep their guard/hands up. However, if the top-level guys are having their guard down - is this the most efficient way to spar? Arms hanging at the sides to intercept fast roundhouse kicks from touching the Hogu? 




 Even in the Flyweight division, the shortest Olympic athlete that placed in London 2012 was 5'10'' which is quite tall compared to my size, 5'7''.  Of course, *anything* is be possible - but regarding EBP, E-Hogus, or Daedo -  scoring tends to favor the fighter with the longer reach.  Especially in a fast-paced game that now favors the lead leg cut kick to keep your opponent at bay and to cancel their kick, which works especially well for taller guys.

I do fine against taller opponents via regular chest guard but against taller guys with the E-Hogu - it's very difficult and I'd imagine, at the Olympic level, seemingly impossible.

The same strategy applies for taller, faster fighters I'd imagine - stay outside their kicking range and don't linger on the inside for too long. Angles and feints. Of course, that's easier said than done - especially if the lengthier fighter has a very good guard.

In fact, a strategy that my coach developed against tall fighters with strong guards that involves making them go negative via penalty points in order to win if traditional scoring just is not working at all. (Focusing on knocking them down/off-balance to make them fall while avoiding losing any points, getting them to step out of the ring, etc.)

Basically, it's a definitely harder to go up against a taller opponent, no question about it. But regarding getting into the Olympic-level in a game that favors height and speed, is that even possible?

Sorry if my grammar doesn't make sense, it's late at night and this is something that's been on my mind lately. 




 Yes.

 Watch out for Crescent kicks to the head from close-clinch distance as well. 




 Yes.

 oh ok ty. i thought it meant south side for a bit. like the gang 




 Thank you for the information. 




 What you learn in Combatives is for an untrained opponent, so live sparring against a jiu-jitsu grappler doesn't really factor into the curriculum.

Well, it would make more sense to do that for self-defense than to prepare yourself against 1/10th of the population that actually knows jiu-jitsu. Most of the time it's someone untrained that's trying to punch your face in. 




 Yeah I just watched this video recently. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgb1Attfm-0

It explains that they hold off on sparring until Blue Belt because it provides a good base for students to spar with when they finally do it. Sparring can be scary and as a white belt you usually end up getting murdered a lot - that can be discouraging and lead to many people giving up and quitting. Holding off on sparring gives them more confidence which leads to more people sticking with GJJ - according to the video. The video also lists their stats on how many people have joined and stayed since they incorporated this new system of instruction regarding the sparring in contrast to how many people have joined and left before the new system. 




 Very good point 




 Can you recommend me a bi/tri program? 




 Started training in Judo recently at my Taekwondo Dojang and the partner I usually pair up with is always falling before I even fully set-up or execute the technique. It makes me question whether what I'm doing is valid or if he's just being too submissive. I'd barely get my hook in on his leg without adding any force for a sweep yet and - there you go, he falls.

I feel like I'm not learning. Also, I should probably point out that my TKD instructor is also a Black Belt in Judo. 




 But that just goes back to the difference in systems right? Gracie Academy is focused on self-defense rather than rolling/free sparring for points. 




 Do the branches created through isolation translate into the trunk? AKA does doing isolation make your compound stronger? 




 What is a good routine/exercises I should follow to build my arms through these "branches"?  




 Do BJJ schools, on average, outside the Gracie Academy focus on what to do in those scenarios? Against an armed assailant, etc. or are they purely focused on what is legal in Sport Jiu-Jitsu? 




 Thank you for your very thorough and informative response. :)

On average, do BJJ schools ever touch-up on the topic of Self-Defense? EX: Neutralizing punches from the guard, escape getting body slammed from an armbar/triangle.

Or do they purely focus on what is legal in Sport BJJ? 




 How can you learn without live sparring? I don't think that's an accurate claim. They likely do have live sparring to prepare for spontaneous self-defense scenarios. 




 You do realize though that students of the Online Academy must be tested in person to earn their Gracie JJ Blue Belt, right? Simply being able to demonstrate the techniques via video may earn you a "Technical" Blue Belt, but an actual Blue Belt must be earned through rolling in the Gracie Academy.
 




 I was referring to how people don't like that Gracie JJ teaches "self-defense" jiu-jitsu rather than "sport" jiu-jitsu. And is there an actual difference between "self-defense" and "sport" jiu-jitsu? 




 Oh, I was referring to the actual instruction at the Gracie Academy. But I understand the frustration about the online Gracie University tuition. 

I'm gonna play the skeptic for fun.

Also, what if the student, in question, has no access to a BJJ school in their area? Gracie University makes Gracie JJ accessible to anyone with internet access.

 Why did you not complete the armbar? What if he had followed up, tried to slam you, or someone else jump in? 




 Why didn't you break his arm when you had the armbar? Why did you let him go!??!?!?!???

 My arms are toothpicks. Please Help.

I heard that if you want aesthetic arms, you must add isolation. Compound exercises do hit the bi's and tri's but doing compound with added isolation will, obviously, hit them even more. Ofc, this is just based on what I've read. I'm a gym n00b. Please help.

 He does indeed mention "Bunshin," however he STILL makes the damned mistake of pointing it out as a **Ninjutsu**. The Ninjutsu variant of the clone jutsu is the Kage Bunshin or Shadow Clone. Bunshin, regular clone technique, is a **Genjutsu**.

EDIT: Am I really being fucking downvoted for pointing out facts? 




 DUDE, THAT'S EXACTLY THE SCENE I WAS REFERRING TO. 




 Can you try to explain it to me? 




 After Naruto knocked down Neji, he proclaimed that he failed the graduation exam three times because of one jutsu that was always on the exam. His clones were pathetic, he said. He failed the **Shadow** Clone Jutsu/**Kage** Bunshin no Jutsu every time.

Interesting, except solid Shadow Clones/Kage Bunshins are not expected of Academy Students to create in order to promote to Genin.  He learned that technique from a Forbidden Scroll that contained the 2nd's Jutsus along with it's more advanced, forbidden version - the Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu/Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu.

Even Kakashi was surprised to witness that Naruto could truly use Shadow Clones in their first bell test.

I checked both versions, the Dub and the Sub for consistency and both versions mention that the Kage Bunshin no Jutsu was on the Academy Promotion Exam.

Even when we see Naruto test for his exam in the very first chapter/episode, he was asked to perform the Genjutsu-Variant, Clone Jutsu/Bunshin no Jutsu.

So what gives? This has always irked me since I first saw the episode.
 




 *grabs your penis* 




  Not speaking from experience, but for martial arts wouldn't you want to focus on speed and power, not size and strength. 

Definitely. But, I'm on "off-season" for competition and this is my first year going up in the Senior Division (18+). A lot of guys cut down to my weight class at 135 or 128 from two, maybe even higher weight classes so they have a sizable strength advantage over me.

I've always been a relatively small guy so I wanted to use this time to focus on building strength and mass and then cutting later once I get to competing again.

Are 5 day splits generally used for building muscle?

 




 Three months. I kind of want to switch to doing a designated muscle group per day and only squatting once a week per leg day. 




 Do you think I should just stick to 5x5 for strength/mass training and deal with the soreness?

EDIT: I just want to do legs once per week.
