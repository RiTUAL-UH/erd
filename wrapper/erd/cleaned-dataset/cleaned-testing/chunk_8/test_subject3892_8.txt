 No love for Terence Crawford here? The dude's unreal. 

I'll also throw in Golovkin and Kovalev.

I feel like I should also say Canelo, but I don't know where I stand on that right now.  




 Ali is quickly becoming one of my favorite fighters. His fight against Abregu showed his power, and his last fight against Santana showed his durability. His face looked like he was hit with a few hammers over the course of the night after that one. 

Bradley is elite, as many of you have mentioned, but I really think we'll one day look back and talk about how he just wasn't the same fighter after Provodnikov. Sure, he got his win over Marquez after that, but that BS draw against Chaves started to really show that scar tissue building up on his face. We saw it again just recently in his fight against Vargas. Combine that with the series of concussions he's accrued (I think he closed out the fight against Vargas with one), and you have to wonder how much more his body can take. 

I've heard him speak a few times about it, but that Provodnikov fight had him talking with a slur for nearly SIX MONTHS after it was over. No doubt he gained the appreciation of fans and showed he can bang, but definitely a cause for concern.

I like Tim, but if Ali gets the edge in this one then Bradley should really start to weigh his options.  




 I actually had a similar convo with a buddy of mine after the Matthysse fight. He's going to be the network journeyman after all is said and done if he doesn't start getting a little more selective with his fights. I mean, I don't want to see him taking on tune up after tune up, but maybe two tune ups, then Matthysse. A tune up and then Rios. His tank-like style doesn't contribute much to longevity. As time goes on there will be less and less on his punches. And then what? 




 Absolute blood bath. Each guy would take years off his career. 




 Damn. Next time wait for him to get a hooker and time the shot for juuuuust the right moment.  




 What? When did I even ask a question? 




 Salido aside, Lomachenko needs a real fight where he is tested. And even that was a test of how many hits to the nuts he can take and still maintain his masculinity.

Rigondeaux cancels guys out, so it will be interesting to see what he does against an accurate volume guy like Lomachenko. 

Great opportunity for each guy to showcase their talents and make some new fans. Hopefully it's as good in the ring as it looks on paper.  




 I stuck it out. Wasn't easy at all. If anything I think it made me want to finish it even sooner. Just to be done with it. 




 Yeeeeeah that was heavy. I had no idea how it would differ from the movie. So imagine my reaction when I came across that scene. haha 




 Haven't read The Road yet, but I think Catcher in the Rye should be read twice in life - once during those teenage angst years, and again in your 30s or 40s.  




 Ditto. I found myself glazing over that one. But I also found it to be artistry in a way whenever Bret Easton Ellis would do it. He knows people don't care about that kind of stuff, and if you actually do maybe you're not much different than the narrator. 




 Ending aside, I think the most memorable part of the book for me was touched on in some of the aforementioned comments regarding his attention to detail. The level of awareness only helps reaffirm the fact that the protagonist is absolutely insane. He's also working in an industry that employs vapid personalities focused only on the aesthetic side of it. Sometimes it's not even a personal aesthetic but it comes down to the restaurant they choose, the car they drive, the suit they wear. He turned all of that nonsensical stuff that the average person not working on Wall Street couldn't relate to into a game of constant judgment that practically anyone at any point in their life CAN relate to.

That said, some of his deaths in the book were even more over the top than the movie. I'm not a prude by any means, but that one murder with the rat gave me fits for days after reading the book. Even now as I think about it I remember the sweats I got as I feverishly turned the pages on that one.  




 This is pretty much one of my biggest fears ever. Hope you're OK.  




 Bought this as two separate volumes at a library sale two weeks ago (the super small print in the paperback version gives me a major headache). Can't wait to start it.  




 Is Bookbub the site that was first to get the Harry Potter series, or am I thinking of something else? 




 I purchased a Kindle 3 in 2010, and then followed up with a Kindle Fire HD tab in 2013. 

The Kindle 3 is your basic e-reader, complete with the page-flip tabs on both the left and right of the frame. Honestly, I love this thing. Even if I read consistently for, say, one hour a day, a single charge can carry it for about three or four weeks so long as you keep wi-fi turned off (outside of buying books, you really don't need it on).

I noticed the complete opposite when I purchased the Fire. Although the color is great and the quality is incredible, I read books to get away from computers and a backlight. Although you can disable the latter, it's heavier than the Kindle 3, flips pages via a swipe motion, and doesn't last nearly as long on one charge as the 3 does. I took this with me on a five-hour flight one time, fully charged with Wi-Fi disabled, and it died before I landed. Side note: If you really like comics or graphic novels, this is an incredible way to read them in the digital world. 

All in all, it comes down to preference. Do you want a tablet or an e-reader? The Fire is more of a tablet in my opinion, while the 3 and paper white versions are meant strictly for the hardcore readers.

As far as my relationship with it goes, I tend to go through fits of interest and disinterest with the tablet. In my mind, nothing beats a good library sale, as indicated by the stacks on stacks of books I have piled up in my room. But sometimes when I travel for business or I want to maybe read a few books at a time, I'll take the Kindle 3 along for the ride.  




 What about in those instances where a plot is hard to follow or just a series of broken storylines? Do you find yourself still going for it out of interest in how it all ends regardless?

If I don't find myself thinking about the book during lulls in my day, odds are I'm not too wrapped up in it. One of the more recent books I picked up and put down shortly after is the first Game of Thrones book. Too many characters and too disjointed for my tastes. I know it has a huge fan following, but it's just not for me.  




 I read the first Hunger Games book and pretty much concluded that it was good enough as a standalone and opted to not continue the series. I know it's a huge hit and all, but there was zero motivation on my part to pursue it as a series.  




 This may seem a little crazy but as a big-time sneaker connoisseur I often times use my girlfriend's nail polish remover to get rid of scuff marks. Of course, a shoe is a little more forgiving than a book, so I would make sure that if you do try this that you use a cotton ball, only a LITTLE BIT of nail polish remover and then give it a go. 

You can also use a rubber eraser if you'd prefer to try that method first. Windex can get the job done too but, again, I'd recommend very little. 

And please, if you do try, let me know if it worked :-)  




 Exactly. How do you not hear the chair roll away? 




 I try so so hard to avoid putting a book down for good. But what once started as a challenge to finish something (no matter how bad) eventually mutated into the understanding that laboring through a bad book was cutting into the time in which I could be reading a good one. So yeah, I've since put down a few books but I've always made sure the next one was very high on my to-read list.  




 You have a good friend.  




 Re-read it for a third time this year. Hits me differently every read.

Also my first Vonnegut book.  




 Waiter Rant is amusing, especially if you've ever served at any point in your life. That said, I still feel like a few of his stories were either created or dramatically embellished for the sake of the book. Still, an entertaining, light read.
