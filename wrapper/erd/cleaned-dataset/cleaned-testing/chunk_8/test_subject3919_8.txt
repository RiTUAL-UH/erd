 I stopped playing the game recently (will come back to it, just into other games now) and I'm seeing a lot of posts about a bad update. What was so bad about it?

 No don't get me wrong he is absolutely my favorite YouTuber (well just the grump family in general) but he plays to the person of "total and utter hilarious d-bag" 




 Yeah but you're almost supposed to kinda hate Arin
 




 I personally enjoyed it! I think it's definitely worth 8 bucks if you're into stealth. 




 I can say they thats not use for skateboarding in normal cases 




 So I guess skaters can't trip.... 




 I added the language as an edit (vb) 




 I am putting the output into a label, it's just giving me the data like how I stated in the post 




 Added as an edit 




 So I have a random number generator and the code is like this

    lbl1.Caption = Int(1 + Rnd * 10)
    lbl2.Caption = Int(1 + Rnd * 10)
    lbl3.Caption = Int(1 + Rnd * 10)


    int1 = lbl1.Caption
    int2 = lbl2.Caption
    int3 = lbl3.Caption

    
    intTotal = int1 + int2 + int3




and say the numbers were 4, 5, 9. I get 459 not 18. What am I doing wrong?

Edit: sorry Visual Basic 




 Disproving evolution with the "some are still the same today is like" statement is like saying if a slice of meat is on a sandwich then slices of meat can't be off a sandwich by themselves therefore sandwiches aren't real.

 So i tried my own code (I can't use your code) and It won't work
   
     Dim strUserSentence, strWord1, strWord2, strNewSentence As String
   
     strUserSentence = txtUserInput.Text

     strWord1 = txtUser1Word

     strWord2 = txtUser2Word

     strNewSentence = strUserSentence.Replace(strWord1, strWord2)

     lblOutput.Caption = strNewSentence

I get runtime error 424: Object required. how can I fix it?
 




 Oh okay thank you! 




 My directions:

Write a program that asks the user to input:

	A sentence

	A word found in the sentence 

	Another word to replace the first word that was selected

When the New Message button is clicked, the original sentence will be displayed with the users first word replaced by the second word.

For example, if the user types Learning to write computer programs is easy. into the first textbox, then easy and challenging into the second and third textboxes, the following message will be displayed, as shown in the interface below

I'm really struggling with this one and I am constantly having errors. How should I approach this? 




 Using the longnail usually avoids this because if they have sheilds while they die they seem to never do it. (longnail avoids sheilds)

 Darksouls PVP is good if you're into that 




 I used 2 layers. I put my wallpaper underneath and the space on top then wrote text over it. I merged the text with the space wallpaper then selected it and delete it to expose the  alt-j wallpaper underneath.
 




 sorry life's been crazy and I could never get around to it. [here it is.](http://imgur.com/DDlGnqZ) if its not right say so I don't mind fixing it 




          better shut up
