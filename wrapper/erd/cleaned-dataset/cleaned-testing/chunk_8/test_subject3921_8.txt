 Pulp Fiction: "Bring out the gimp" 




 Additional question: Have any of you seen "The Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"? If so, is that worth a watch? 




 Thanks! Never considered The Abyss, love James Cameron though. Will definitely add to the list! 




 Excluding Jaws, I have not seen or heard of any good underwater thrillers. Do you guys know of any? (Documentaries about the ocean are welcome). 




 I love him in Horrible Bosses, along with the rest of the trio. He is a very loveable guy and can't imagine hating him in any role. 




 "If this doesn't work out for you, you fuck off back to your studio palace and dive back into that cultural genocide you guys are perpetrating. You know, a douche bag is born every minute, that was P.T. Barnum's premise when he invented the circus, and nothing much has changed, and you guys know that if you crank out any toxic piece of crap, people will line up and pay to see it, but long after your gone, I'm gonna be on that stage, earning my living, bearing my soul, wrestling with real complex human emotions!" -Mike Shiner(Edward Norton), Birdman (or the unexpected virtue of ignorance) 




 Don't believe I could conjure up a top 10, but my top 5 would be:

1. Guardians of the Galaxy
2. The Dark Knight 
3. Iron Man
4. The Avengers 
5. Captain America: The Winter Soldier 




 Forrest Gump, no doubt. He is one of my favorite movie characters of all time and seems like the guy who'd be with you through thick and thin.  




 I agree, Rogen has sort of cornered himself in comedy. I would love to see him become like Jonah Hill and show off some dramatic acting chops. Obviously they saw something to cast him in the movie, I have great faith. My guess he will be much better than Gad, but I'm pretty sure they were just shooting for look-alikes. 




 Landed on Gangs,and I am very much a movie enthusiast. I absolutely adore and appreciate great acting and creative direction, loved Gangs. 




 Oh don't worry I watched the first five minutes with my great aunt Dot. Had to turn it off immediately and was not really feeling it, landed on Gangs. Absolutely loved it. 




 Thank you, I was strongly considering Clockwork. I appreciate the input. 




 I have not.
