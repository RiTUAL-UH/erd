 I'm 5 years older than my younger sister, and when she was born I could never really grasp the concept that she had severe mental retardation. My parents always said she was "special", but I was too young to understand. I grew up loving and caring for her and I doted on her. She was too mentally retarded to walk or talk, and only communicated by pulling hair. 

Fast forward and at this point I'm now a middle schooler who is ashamed and embarrassed of her own sister. I refuse to let my friends come over and rarely ever talk about my sister even though she was the light of my life, I cared more about fitting in. I constantly used the word "retarded" even though it made me uncomfortable knowing thats what people would call my sister. 

One day, the first time I brought a friend to my house to hang out, they saw my sister and called her a "disgusting retarded freak" and she started to cry. I was distraught ag seeing her cry and being FULLY AWARE of peoples opinions and what they said about her. I kicked my friend out and hugged my sister for a full hour. 

After that, I realized that my sister isn't something to be ashamed of. She's my best friend, and to this day she will always be the love and light of my life.  




 As a high school senior who was accepted into UNC and is a NC native...this is why I declined my acceptance.  




 I've heard her acoustic version of Yellow Flicker Beat and it was beautiful! She is seriously gifted because her pipes are amazing 




 Many people say Royals is a pos song and that her voice is too "dark" to be a pop singer and that she has no clue how to dance. Let the girl do what she wants! She's awesome. 




 In my area (the southern states) everyone's like "LORDE? more like GAY! Jason Aldean is more pop than her!" 

As you can see, my highschool is full of 6th graders hahah 




 Lorde. Everyone always shits on her but I find her music to be very catchy 




 Kinder surprise eggs! 




 wow, thats so sad to hear. how are you holding up? 

i wish that you have all the icecream and sad movies in the world to cheer you up! 




 Added! Snapchat is princess-kawaii 




 Went to the doctor on Monday and she said it didnt seem like an infection, just severely irritated. She took preventative measures and prescribed me 3 day antibiotics and a saline solution. So far the swelling has gone down to almost normal but it still looks a bit pink/red. So far so good, though :) 




 i never thought of the post being too short. i havent changed it since i got my nose pierced, thanks for the advice!  




 OK, I will look into making an appointment. Will icing it and applying tea tree oil and taking an anti-inflammatory help until I can get an appointment? I really dont want to have to remove my piercing  




 Nope. I've kept it a stud for work related reasons, and the jewelry has remained the same (and its good quality).  




 I had my nose pierced about 4 months ago, and up until yesterday my nose had been healing fine. Yesterday I woke up from a nap and saw that my nose was HUGE and tender to the touch. I applied ice for about 15 minutes every hour or so. I applied Tea tree oil at night and when I woke up my nose was only a little better... Now the stud is sinking into my skin and I don't know what caused this. I don't think its an infection because I don't have any secretions or crustiness. Its just really red, swollen and hot to the touch. Should I still apply ice and tea tree oil to help soothe my piercing? 

Advice is VERY welcome!! 









 I met Ian Watkins at a lostprophets M G. He was super creepy, and kept trying to lure me away from my mom (I was 14 at the time, so she wouldn't let me go alone)

It was really making me uncomfortable so I left to talk to the other members, and he called me a "slut" to my face :( 

Needless to say, I still love their music but I'm glad that asshat is in jail.  




 Nightmare and the Cat- Alvarado

 Downvoted because youre ugly and that lipstick is too red 




 I would like to think 5 feet is short
