 I am a peggle addict but they don't make it for Android. Is there a decent Peggle like game for Android? 




 It depends on your mood. I saw Fury
 last night and it was epic. The action scenes in it are unreal. It's a good emotional movie that make you feel for the main characters. 

However if you want to laugh then 22 is a pretty funny movie that I reckon is up there with the first one.  




 Hey thanks heaps for all the advice. The date went real well  and netted me plenty of brownie point.  




 I'm playing on the X One. I'm guessing that sadly it's not that easy.  




 I have a friend who is a little irritating and he keeps joining my fireteam. Is there a way I can set it so my team is private or he cant join? 




 You are really the about Barb. In a podcast she shows off a Senators puck that someone gave her.  




 In college football Geoff is an Alabama fan
