 I'm not sure, But I believe there are some cases I've heard about where they just pick someone, usually someone they see as a threat in some way or even someone they just don't like and terrorize them, kinda like a school bully o-o. 

 I'm not well versed in Navajo Culture or such and I havent spoken to my grandma in many years. I'd love to get in touch with her again and I may just try and do that this weekend, but I'm not sure how stable her mentality is these days (like I said, she's in her 90's) 




 I firmly believe that at one point, I was a cat. Which is why I think I have such a connection with cats now. I have *always* loved cats, ever since I was little. 

I don't remember this, but my mom said that when I was little, about 5 or 6, we were going to visit some friends of my parents way out in the country, I was looking out the window and as we passed a big, read barn, I go "hey! I was born there!" pointing at the barn. 

My mom goes "no, you were born in the hospital silly"

and I go "oh, I know now, but before, I was born there, in the hay, with my brothers and sister, we liked to play a lot and my mom always brought us mice to play with".

She even said how I insisted I'd been born in that barn, even went into detail about what my "mother" and "brothers and sister" looked like. 

My parents knew the people who lived in the property with the barn and they did have a lot of cats. 

Every once in a while, growing up, I'd have dreams where I was wondering through the woods and I'd wake up the next morning bone tired. 

I don't dream like that so much anymore. 

May have just been my imagination though, while I do believe in reincarnation, I don't necessarily believe that we are meant to remember past lives.   




 Never seen anything, but I've heard of them. 

Jumpers, my grandmother called them. 

Beings from other times or dimensions, not aliens, but not something belonging to our world but that exist along side us. We usually cannot see them, but they are aware of us and so go out of their way to stay hidden. 

Most of them are harmless and are usually more scared of you than you are of them. But some can be Maleficent. 

My grandma on my moms side(she's 1/2 Navajo and 1/2 Irish) once told us a story of how, when she was a kid, she followed what she thought was a shadow cat, about 4 feet tall into the woods, she followed it until it disappeared into a rock only to find that she had ended up over 4 miles from her house.
