 I read through the two stories. I'll try to give you some feedback tonight. Noticed you're on the front page again though, congrats.

Honestly it seems like you're doing great so far. 




 Too late to make a save. He's thinking that if she becomes encumbered while floating, she sinks to the bottom. 




 That's not "dead in the water." Your scores are actually fairly good. And you got picked up by Chilling Tales for Dark Nights on both counts, so I'd say you're off to a great start!

Keep writing consistently and you're sure to pick up a following.

 OK, so Grindhorse is in. Who else? 




 No... Should I be? 




 Maybe he *has* and nobody knows his username. 




 Congrats on the internet. 




 This isn't appropriate for /r/nosleep, since you didn't invent BEK. It might be alright for /r/creepypasta or something like that. 




 Yeah, hey, can we get a "filter by:" twist/no twist option? 




 *L - U - N - C - H - B - O - X*

I pulled the trigger and the adhesive label dropped into my hand. Putting it on straight wasn't easy, but I did the best I could.

*F - R - I - G - E*

*Clunk.*

Maybe all the words weren't spelled exactly right, but I knew what everything was. It made me happy to see them wearing their name tags. Things called just what they were.

I went down the hall to my parents' door.

*M - E - A - N - I - E - S*

*Clunk.*

I'd probably get in trouble for that later. I hurried down the hall to my room and locked the door. I labeled a few toys. My Etch-A-Sketch already had its name written on it, so I skipped that one.

I took out Daddy's toy from where I'd hidden it at the bottom of the toy box.

*G - U - N*

*Clunk.*

Then I pulled the trigger. 




 I like to think that the artist giggled like beavis as he wrote in that "69." 




 You leave out one word! "Along flesh" instead of "along *his* flesh," and suddenly it's a whole different story! 




 Not a mod, but you asked this almost 24 hours ago...

Without seeing it, it's just kind of hard to answer. /r/shortscarystories is for original works. They have rules against series/multiple parts and links to outside sources (specifically for self-promotion). My interpretation of it is that the *intent* of those rules should discourage you from posting it here.

A good rule of thumb is "What if everyone started doing this?" and I think that in this case it would be a negative thing. Be inspired by what you read, write whatever you want, but this probably isn't the proper outlet for it.

My personal opinion is that /r/DarkTales should be more popular than it is. /r/LibraryofShadows is another one, though the CSS there makes my eyes bleed. There used to be /r/AlmanacofHorrors (RIP) where I'd post things that just didn't fit anywhere else.

There probably are other poetry subs that would enjoy it. I'm not a poet, so I wouldn't really know. Maybe /r/poetry? 




 I'm *very* surprised that this wasn't Rick Astley. 




 "Heart rate normalizing."

*Damn, that's strong. Clear cut. It might even be beautiful if it weren't going to end up killing him.*

"Nurse, do those cameras work?"

"Yes, doctor."

"Could you have someone turn them on, please?"

"Yes, sir. But... why?"

"I'll explain as I go."

I looked over at the anesthesiologist. "We're okay for about ten more minutes, right?"

"We're doing good now. He didn't like whatever you just poked, though. Heart rate shot right up."

"Camera's are on, doctor."

"Thank you.

"This is Doctor Edward Harris. It's June 21st, 2015 at Maine Medical Center. Please, just read the first page of the chart for the cameras if you would, nurse."

"Patrick D'aury, 24 years old, male. Self-admitted with no other family or friends on June 21st complaining of pain in the left arm from a human bite. No apparent physical wounds were found despite large amounts of blood being present. Patient began to seize. PET/CT scan showed a mass in the lower brain - "

"Thank you. The patient experiences phantom pain and delusion while awake and under general anesthesia."

"Ahem. Delusion wouldn't exist under anesthesia."

"Patients don't dream when they're unconscious?"

"No."

"Are you completely sure?"

"Heart rate is rising."

"Brain is lighting up like a christmas tree."

"He's moving."

"Doctor, you're killing him!"

"Heart rate is stabilizing."

"What the fuck is this? Did you kink the tube or something?"

"He had a dream. A bad one, probably, or an exciting one. When mild electrical stimulus is applied directly to the tumor, the patient dreams."

"He *can't* dream. He's -- "

"I'll do it again. Nurse, please watch his eyes and make sure that it's recorded by the camera."

"They're not moving, they're just...

"Wait. That... That's REM."

"Thank you. It's inoperable to say the least. One of a few fast-growing cancerous masses that seeds deep into the brain stem. They're unique. One-in-a-billion, one-in-two-billion. And yet, one of *seven* found in the past two weeks."

"You're sure, doctor?"

"Take that tape, have it sent to the CDC."

"The CDC?"

"Cut the anesthesia."

"But we haven't closed up yet."

"Tie him down. Use the heaviest restrains that you've got."

"Tie him - what's going on here?"

"Leave the brain open. I need him awake. I have to be able to ask him questions. And I have to be able to stop him."

"Sir, this is unethical. It's wrong! He'll feel everything!"

"I hope to God that he does. If he's like the others, though, he's already lost that. First the senses, and then the memories. Once cognition goes, he *will* be dangerous."

"Restraints are in place."

"Everyone out."

"O-out?"

"This is on me. If he's progressing the same as the others, I can't allow him to live. I also will not allow any of you to accept the responsibility of taking a life with me."

I pulled the pistol out of my scrubs and pointed it at each of them as they left the room.

The patient was starting to move. Eyes flicking, mouth working.

"Patrick. Patrick, can you hear me?

"Patrick, do you know where you are?

"Tell me what day it is.

"Answer me, Patrick. Come on, ***are you alive in there?***" 




 No book from me. Congrats though. And for anyone else not in the know, check out /r/writerschoice.

 Meh, I thought it was a little shredded.

 Calling all ~~Survivors~~ Writers,

Look!

It's a story prompt! A collaborative writing project! A... *zombie-flash-fiction-rap-battle?*

Well... maybe.

If you want to write some flash fiction tales of psychosis, cannibalism, murder and the downfall of modern civilization they bring on (or riff off someone else's vignette as a prompt) then /r/thezombiedelusion is the place.

Deets for the lazy, which are now in the sidebar:  

**What is The Zombie Delusion?**  
A collaborative writing sub of stories taking place in a single universe, where the apocalypse is caused by the spread of mental, not physical, illness. People begin to think they or others are infected with a zombie virus and act accordingly (the delusion), causing the collapse of civilization by their actions.

**What causes it?**  
There is no one single cause or origin of the delusion. This can vary from story to story, or ideally, not be explained or referenced at all.

**How do I participate?**  
[Report an infection](http://www.reddit.com/r/thezombiedelusion/submit?selftext=true). Stories should be told from the point of view of, or around, characters experiencing the delusion. Others are then free to write alternate points of view of the same events (or a related story) in the comments. Please do not directly continue the original story - additions should be related or from a different perspective but ***not a straight continuation of the submitter's original story.***

**Why another sub?**  
It just sort of happened. A little collaboration that was born in /r/shortscarystories that is now open to everyone.

**Where's this business?**  
/r/thezombiedelusion

Let's get infected.

 Nice work on the CSS, itch! 




 I go to therapy. At one point in time it was mandated, and I just kept going for the entertainment value. The drama. Some people have celebrity gossip, and I go listen to people talk about their problems. Is it so different?

Some of the most juicy group sessions are for military vets, police officers and security guards. 

"I let him go with a warning and he killed his wife that night."

"My partner is gone and I don't deserve to be here."

"I shot a kid."

It's the stuff you might not believe if you didn't hear the eyewitness saying it.

There was a newcomer at our session. Fresh from Mule Creek where they send law enforcement to keep them insulated and safe. Prison's still prison though, and the older man looked like he'd been in long enough to pick up some habits. He was nervous, glancing over his shoulder, trying to keep an eye on everyone at once but not meeting their eyes. I'd been watching him since he walked in. It's a game I play: I try to guess what kind of incident brought them to this path in life.

I had him pegged as someone who went too far, got carried away and killed someone. He seemed a little unhinged.

After introductions and with a little encouragement from the facilitator, he opens up and drops a fucking bombshell.

I know him. From the train.

I saw the bite, I saw everything. I still have the scar.

I also saw him shoot the wrong man while they shuffled out the door.
 




 I'll just pretend you were talking about me. 




 If you haven't torn the closet completely apart yet, get on it. There's something in there and ghosts don't use cars. 




 Sure, they'll ask that until they find the camera inside. 




 My goodness, that was fantastic. 




 Congrats, everyone! Especially /u/deadnspread. You're the man!

And thank you, ~~Chuck Norris~~ Anonymous User. 




 Mostly because of your username :P

Did you know about his page: http://theitchwrites.com/ ? 




 This is really unsettling for some reason. It's like her brain's skipping a cog or something. 




 Are you... *stalking* the_itch? 




 Nice! Thanks for the help. 




 I know exactly how I caught it. They say it spreads through blood and saliva, and I know exactly the moment when it entered my body.

"That's expensive wine, you know" I said to my wife. It was our thirteenth anniversary and I'd taken her out to dinner at our favorite place we couldn't afford. She'd been just comatose all night. I'd bought the whole bottle, but she had only taken one sip from her glass. "If you don't drink it, I'm pouring it back into the bottle."

"Why don't you... just... drink it yourself?" she asked. Her eyes settled on me, unfocused, staring off into the distance.

"Are you okay?"

"Oh yeah. I feel... *greeeat*."

"Marie. Are you doing drugs?"

"Oh no. I think... I'm... just..." I waited, but she never finished the sentence.

I asked for the check. I was starting to worry about the way that the color had gone out of her cheeks.

That was when it happened. I drank the wine, swallowed the infection down in big gulps and doomed myself.

She was right, though. I feel right... as... 




 I work for the city, cleaning the ancient floodwater systems beneath the streets. It's a creepy place, and at the beginning of every day, I have to do a sweep to check for people who've snuck in. They usually leave during the day, but the last thing you want to do is work overtime and be under when it gets dark. People get in. A lot of scary people live down there.

Downstream of Gibbs Market, some branches fell into the stream, then those caught a big mess of plastic bags blown in from the parking lot, and the whole thing got constipated faster than my 80-year-old father eating hotdogs on the Fourth of July.

I fixed it a little at a time but it took extra tools. After that many trips back to my van, I had lost track of time. When I came up, town had been transformed. There was a green glow to everything, especially the people. I don't know... how that happens to someone's skin. They were all *green.* How long do you have to be dead for your skin to turn that color?

Back into the sewers I went. I could only run and hide like a rat..

I heard them coming down the tunnels. In my hands, I held the big axe I use to break up the bigger logs. There were so many voices, though, I knew it would be no use... *almost* no use. I wonder if I'll feel it when I end myself.

If you find this note, tell my family that I love them.

And flush the storm drains. 




 Eight days ago, you could have found me over on the back porch of the Dillon Family ranch, ice cold beer in one hand, cigarette in the other and sweet, sweet Jessie Dillon sucking me off like a Hoover. That might be the last good memory I'll make now that the world's ended.

A real shame, too. The rest of the Dillons weren't too bright. That's probably why they didn't make it. Jessie, though... I tried to teach her like my Papa taught me. "Be ready for anything," he'd say. "'Cause the end comes at the time of his choosing, but it comes. It *always* comes."

And he was God damned right, too, nevermind all the shit they used to talk about him. What in the fuck is a "Prepper" anyway?

Well, last Sunday I shot a man for sneaking around on my property. He was all dressed up in a fancy black suit. I almost took his head clean off.

Then I recognized the clothes he was wearing. They were the ones we buried Papa's body in. Now, I've seen that before, in the movies. I'm glad I was ready for anything.

I went over to the Dillons' place and they were all acting crazy, screaming and trying to grab me and my gun as soon as they saw me in their living room.

I found poor Jessie. They got her too, but I couldn't pull the trigger. I like her. 

I got her tied her up while I try to find the cure. There's gotta be something in this Bible that can fix her. 




 They're supposed to plan for this type of thing. Governments and security agencies are supposed to have plans in place. A *contingency*, they call it.

But it happened gradually. It spread so slowly that they couldn't even detect it. It wasn't until people started dying that it became apparent what was happening. By then it was too late. Of course, it happened on a Black Friday. Of all days. People crammed around the entrance of the mall, pushing, pulsing, moving in waves. One infected person became a thousand, and there was nowhere for them to run.

Maybe that was my savior, though, it being the biggest shopping day of the year. I was at work four hours earlier than usual, making my rounds when I heard them start moaning outside. Checking the monitors from the security station revealed just how bad it was.

I roused Mike, asleep in his chair, his little girl slumped in his arms -- the difficulties of being a single parent with odd hours. I suddenly wondered how they'd even made it there. I couldn't remember them coming inside. 

"Mike. Wake up. It's bad. They've got us surrounded."

"Wha-? Of course we are. Did you forget what day it is?"

"Look at them out there. This is something different."

Mike set his daughter down and studied the monitors, frowning face bathed in the gray glow. Small figures tore each other apart in low-definition. "It's... I dunno. God. Oh, shit, God. Should we call the police?"

"We can't. We're on our own," I said as I offered him a pistol.

"Jesus! What the fuck are you doing with that thing?"

"Self defense. Something like this was bound to happen sooner or later. I felt it coming, so I prepared."

"You can't be serious. Put that down before you hurt someone. We just need to figure this out. Those are *people* down there!"

I put the gun back in my belt. "Come with me." Mike stared, unmoving. "I'll show you. You don't believe me? I'll show you real monsters." The tone in my voice didn't leave room for argument. Mike went to the next room to wake Casey.

"She's not moving!" he shouted. "Something's wrong with her, she's not waking up!"

As he knelt over her unconscious body, I quickly struck him on the back of the skull. A half hour later, he found himself on top of the roof.

"You're sick," he said.

"No, I'm not. And neither are you. They are, though." I gestured to the pirhanal masses below. "They're not human anymore, Mike. They're gone."

"Ca- where's Casey?" He tried to stand with numb legs.

"Casey's gone, Mike. I saw that bite. They're all gone. There's only one thing left to do." 




 My sister Tabitha has been called many things. "Strange." "A freak." "Unstable." To me, though, she's always been one thing: a burden.

Our parents weren't really around much growing up. Dad was always on the road and mom threw herself into her work as a doctor. That made me, the older sister, the adult. They've never accepted that Tabitha has a problem.

I lived at my parents' house until she graduated high school. I worked a minimum wage job to save enough for first and last month's rent on two apartments, at the same time as I helped her with her homework. My mother called me a freeloader and a waste almost every single day. Finally the day came and we left. I still had to keep an eye on my sister. There's no telling what kind of trouble she might get into.

I showed her how to shop. To do laundry. I even found her a job that she can do from her apartment. She wanted a pet, so we adopted a cat. An old gray Norwegian she named Frank. (It's short for Frankenstein. She's into gross, creepy stuff like that. I think she even posted here once or twice.) Frank was a girl, but it didn't matter to Tabitha.

Years went by. We found a sort of precarious balance. But when Frank died, she almost lost it. We got her another, a kitten this time. Then she found one on the street. Then two more. Then a litter of kittens. She tried to hide them from me, but eventually I found out. Four of the kittens were dead, hiding under her bed. I let her keep one, and the rest went to the Humane Society. It was a bad time for us. That was a few months ago.

She *is* improving, though. Most days I just call her on Skype to check in on her...

Yesterday, I called and she didn't answer. I'd just gotten off working a double, and almost just left it at that.

When I called again, she had this huge smile on her face.

"Frank came back!" she said so loud that it distorted the microphone.

"Frank?" There in her arms, I saw a gray Norwegian. "Tabby, no."

"He's back! He was just sick. See?"

Until then, I'd thought she might have dug up Frank's corpse, but this cat was alive, tail jerking back and forth. It did look a lot like Frank, except for the eyes. Even through the computer screen, I could tell that this cat's eyes were a striking green color.

"I'm coming over."

"No!" she screamed.

"Swear to god, Tabitha. I'm not going through this with you again. That cat isn't yours. We're taking it back."

She harumphed like a toddler. "Can't he just stay the night?"

My stomach growled and my soft, warm mattress called out to me from the next room. I sighed. "Fine. *One* night. Tomorrow, he's going back, though, and we're having a long talk about taking things that don't belong to you."

That was the last conversation I had with my sister. Please, if you know anything.... If you've seen her... I'm worried to death about her. 




 Chaplain? Hi, it's PFC Tucker.

I called earlier. Did you get my other message? Oh... okay. Well, we're headed back outside the wire soon, so this is going to kind of be like the last time I'll have access to a phone for a few days.

Anyway, it's about Private Webb. He's, uh, not doing so well, I don't think. We've all seen stuff. Scary, crazy stuff, but the last time we went into this village on a patrol, things went really tits up. Sorry, I, I mean... Well, yeah, they got bad.

They knew we were coming. That's not new, but these ones, I don't know what they were thinking...? They just came out of the buildings and started running for us, and I've never seen that before. We started putting them down fast. It wasn't, like, really a fight, but then somebody else outside the town started with the mortars.

Webb was in the first Humvee, right up front manning the .50 cal. That first mortar dropped right in the middle of the street. It hit the group of them running at us. Pretty good shot -- I mean, they were aiming for us, but they took out all their own guys. Must have got about six or eight of them. So Webb, he's got front row seats for this. 

You ever seen someone get hit by artillery like that, Chaplain? Right, so you know, there's just... *parts* all over. The sand and dust clears and you can't even tell who's who anymore. Webb's seen that before, too. We all have.

Now, I'm about three trucks back, and it's time to get the fuck out of -- sorry, it's time to get out of there before the next round hits, so we're trying to turn around and hightail it, but Webb starts opening up on them. He used up everything he had, melted the barrel, just held down the trigger like they teach you not to do. The sound of the gun fades out, we're driving back out again, and you can just hear Webb screaming and crying like a madman.

He's like, "Why didn't they die?"

The guys in his Hummer got him to calm down before we got back. When I saw him, he just seemed kind of tired. I asked him if he was doing okay, and what happened back on that last mission... and he gave me this look. I've known Webb since basic, Chaplain, and I've never seen a look like that from him.

I think he's hiding something in his locker. He knows we're not supposed to loot the places we go to, but I think maybe he found something and kept it. I don't know. Maybe it's nothing. Just another month of this and we get to go back home, and maybe that's what he needs.

Maybe you could talk with him, though? Try and see if he's okay? I don't want to get him in trouble or anything. I'm just trying to help.

 Good, congrats on the first post. I really liked that dream sequence, that was creepy.

Maybe just a personal opinion thing, but I'd lose that "******PART 2 WILL UPDATE SOON!!!11!!!****** stuff on the bottom. Just tag it as a series, and if anything say that you're going to try to find out more.

Good luck! 




 It's gone! :O 




 That's amazing! Very industrial-looking for a swimming pool because of the bare concrete. Looks like a place I'd have liked to play as a kid too. 




 Pool as in swimming pool? 




 To avoid a story that doesn't translate to spoken word very well, you could look for ones that have been read on YouTube. There are a bunch of channels. 




 Thanks! 




 Bolt cutters snapped the lock and it clattered to the floor.

I wore a mask, but the stench gagged me. My flashlight revealed so many bodies -- so many *more* than I'd imagined. Slumped over desks, onto the floor, several crowded around the door. Hollow eyes and limbs stripped to the bone. Where one corpse ended and the next began was indistinguishable.

Cold air and bad feelings washed over me as I stepped inside. An improvised tomb, that's what this was. A tomb for monsters, they damned humanity.

In this lab, they'd created the virus. It took over the brain, killing the parts that didn't serve its purpose like pain, fear, love, even death. It turned anyone, even your own family, into hellish fiends. All that remained were the basic instincts.

To kill.

To feed.

They'd tried to send a message -- maybe they had a cure. Papers were scattered on desks. Memos, notes, schedules. Nothing that could help. Anything important had been stored on their computer system, locked away forever.

In the large office at the end of the hall I found a handwritten note written on official-looking letterhead, splattered with blood. A used pistol laid on it like a paperweight.

The rest of you may keep searching for a cure. As for me, I believe that none exists. This sickness is designed by God, and we've been doomed according to his wishes. If you intend to stop the virus, you must kill God.

I heard bodies begin moving in the next room. 

This wasn't where it started.

This was where the battle to save us was lost. 




 Oh whoah, thanks! 




 That little "how-to" booklet is the bees knees. 




 Everything that /u/Human_Gravy said.

Finish it. One discouraging thing is that you're breaking it into parts already. Why drag it out like that? Why not just tell the story you want and worry about formatting and organization later?

So what I think you should do is finish your first draft of this. There's some good news here: first drafts suck. It's not a big deal because no one is going to see it but you, and now you have someplace to start. Then re-read it. Then re-re-read it. And again. Then, when you've made edits and fixed timing and dialogue and cut out the weird distracting parts that aren't working, **then** ask other people what they think.  Don't ask them to write your story for you.

It might sound like a lot of work, but you've been carrying this idea around in your head for years, so don't be afraid to do it some justice. 




 The cost a good gripple is insane these days. 









 I hate this title and it doesn't really fit with any ongoing projects. Just had a thought and rolled with it. 




 You know I don't like when you breathe on my neck. I prefer kisses.

 Snakes? Zombies. 




 I work for the city, cleaning the ancient floodwater systems beneath the streets. It's a creepy place, and at the beginning of every day, I have to do a sweep to check for people who've snuck in. They usually leave during the day, but the last thing you want to do is work overtime and be under when it gets dark. People get in. A lot of scary people live down there.

Downstream of Gibbs Market, some branches fell into the stream, then those caught a big mess of plastic bags blown in from the parking lot, and the whole thing got constipated faster than my 80-year-old father eating hotdogs on the Fourth of July.

I fixed it a little at a time but it took extra tools. After that many trips back to my van, I had lost track of time. When I came up, town had been transformed. There was a green glow to everything, especially the people. I don't know... how that happens to someone's skin. They were all *green.* How long do you have to be dead for your skin to turn that color?

Back into the sewers I went. I could only run and hide like a rat..

I heard them coming down the tunnels. In my hands, I held the big axe I use to break up the bigger logs. There were so many voices, though, I knew it would be no use... *almost* no use. I wonder if I'll feel it when I end myself.

If you find this note, tell my family that I love them.

And flush the storm drains. 




 I just meant "huose." :P 




 Weird, it worked on /r/nosleepreruns (except the colors are backwards, oops). I'll kind of miss all my posts getting gold, though. ;) 




 Welcome!

Did you want them wider? There might be a way... 




 *Eye twitching increases.* 




 That's not the problem here! 




 Like wdalphin said, unchecked the box, and you'll see it in reddit's default CSS.

Another option is to use Pocket, a browser extension that's useful for a lot of things, but in this case, it can re-format the text in article view to make it easier to read.

Or even paste the URL into skimreddit.com, which also re-formats it for reading. 




 The idea is kind of fun. It just didn't have that immersive realism that nosleep is so good for. I couldn't suspend my disbelief. Maybe /r/Darktales would like this? 




 If they stopped updating on nosleep, it's safe to say that they died. 




 They got grazer and laser and all kind o -azers! 




 Huh. Interesting. I think you might be onto something there. 




 Someone's got to get out there for the rest of us to write about. 




 I know exactly how I caught it. They say it spreads through blood and saliva, and I know exactly the moment when it entered my body.

"That's expensive wine, you know" I said to my wife. It was our thirteenth anniversary and I'd taken her out to dinner at our favorite place we couldn't afford. She'd been just comatose all night. I'd bought the whole bottle, but she had only taken one sip from her glass. "If you don't drink it, I'm pouring it back into the bottle."

"Why don't you... just... drink it yourself?" she asked. Her eyes settled on me, unfocused, staring off into the distance.

"Are you okay?"

"Oh yeah. I feel... *greeeat*."

"Marie. Are you doing drugs?"

"Oh no. I think... I'm... just..." I waited, but she never finished the sentence.

I asked for the check. I was starting to worry about the way that the color had gone out of her cheeks.

That was when it happened. I drank the wine, swallowed the infection down in big gulps and doomed myself.

She was right, though. I feel right... as...

 I came for the movie review. Aw.

So I submitted *"Next Year,"* and it may not be the classiest thing to do, but I'll vote for it. It's one of a few stories I've got bookmarked so I can come back to it again and again. AL is really great as well.

 This one gets it. 




 Oh, so you must know the Dillons then. 




 I'm not afraid of the bogeyman. I *am* the bogeyman! 




 That's some city folk shit right there. Though that guy in blue did kind look like my Papa. 




 Yes! 




 In a good way, though... Right? *Right?* 




 Eight days ago, you could have found me over on the back porch of the Dillon Family ranch, ice cold beer in one hand, cigarette in the other and sweet, sweet Jessie Dillon sucking me off like a Hoover. That might be the last good memory I'll make now that the world's ended.

A real shame, too. The rest of the Dillons weren't too bright. That's probably why they didn't make it. Jessie, though... I tried to teach her like my Papa taught me. "Be ready for anything," he'd say. "'Cause the end comes at the time of his choosing, but it comes. It *always* comes."

And he was God damned right, too, nevermind all the shit they used to talk about him. What in the fuck is a "Prepper" anyway?

Well, last Sunday I shot a man for sneaking around on my property. He was all dressed up in a fancy black suit. I almost took his head clean off.

Then I recognized the clothes he was wearing. They were the ones we buried Papa's body in. Now, I've seen that before, in the movies. I'm glad I was ready for anything.

I went over to the Dillons' place and they were all acting crazy, screaming and trying to grab me and my gun as soon as they saw me in their living room.

I found poor Jessie. They got her too, but I couldn't pull the trigger. I like her. 

I got her tied her up while I try to find the cure. There's gotta be something in this Bible that can fix her. 




 Love it! Posting on SSS now.

 My sister Tabitha has been called many things. "Strange." "A freak." "Unstable." To me, though, she's always been one thing: a burden.

Our parents weren't really around much growing up. Dad was always on the road and mom threw herself into her work as a doctor. That made me, the older sister, the adult. They've never accepted that Tabitha has a problem.

I lived at my parents' house until she graduated high school. I worked a minimum wage job to save enough for first and last month's rent on two apartments, at the same time as I helped her with her homework. My mother called me a freeloader and a waste almost every single day. Finally the day came and we left. I still had to keep an eye on my sister. There's no telling what kind of trouble she might get into.

I showed her how to shop. To do laundry. I even found her a job that she can do from her apartment. She wanted a pet, so we adopted a cat. An old gray Norwegian she named Frank. (It's short for Frankenstein. She's into gross, creepy stuff like that. I think she even posted here once or twice.) Frank was a girl, but it didn't matter to Tabitha.

Years went by. We found a sort of precarious balance. But when Frank died, she almost lost it. We got her another, a kitten this time. Then she found one on the street. Then two more. Then a litter of kittens. She tried to hide them from me, but eventually I found out. Four of the kittens were dead, hiding under her bed. I let her keep one, and the rest went to the Humane Society. It was a bad time for us. That was a few months ago.

She *is* improving, though. Most days I just call her on Skype to check in on her...

Yesterday, I called and she didn't answer. I'd just gotten off working a double, and almost just left it at that.

When I called again, she had this huge smile on her face.

"Frank came back!" she said so loud that it distorted the microphone.

"Frank?" There in her arms, I saw a gray Norwegian. "Tabby, no."

"He's back! He was just sick. See?"

Until then, I'd thought she might have dug up Frank's corpse, but this cat was alive, tail jerking back and forth. It did look a lot like Frank, except for the eyes. Even through the computer screen, I could tell that this cat's eyes were a striking green color.

"I'm coming over."

"No!" she screamed.

"Swear to god, Tabitha. I'm not going through this with you again. That cat isn't yours. We're taking it back."

She harumphed like a toddler. "Can't he just stay the night?"

My stomach growled and my soft, warm mattress called out to me from the next room. I sighed. "Fine. *One* night. Tomorrow, he's going back, though, and we're having a long talk about taking things that don't belong to you."

That was the last conversation I had with my sister. Please, if you know anything.... If you've seen her... I'm worried to death about her.

 They're supposed to plan for this type of thing. Governments and security agencies are supposed to have plans in place. A *contingency*, they call it.

But it happened gradually. It spread so slowly that they couldn't even detect it. It wasn't until people started dying that it became apparent what was happening. By then it was too late. Of course, it happened on a Black Friday. Of all days. People crammed around the entrance of the mall, pushing, pulsing, moving in waves. One infected person became a thousand, and there was nowhere for them to run.

Maybe that was my savior, though, it being the biggest shopping day of the year. I was at work four hours earlier than usual, making my rounds when I heard them start moaning outside. Checking the monitors from the security station revealed just how bad it was.

I roused Mike, asleep in his chair, his little girl slumped in his arms -- the difficulties of being a single parent with odd hours. I suddenly wondered how they'd even made it there. I couldn't remember them coming inside. 

"Mike. Wake up. It's bad. They've got us surrounded."

"Wha-? Of course we are. Did you forget what day it is?"

"Look at them out there. This is something different."

Mike set his daughter down and studied the monitors, frowning face bathed in the gray glow. Small figures tore each other apart in low-definition. "It's... I dunno. God. Oh, shit, God. Should we call the police?"

"We can't. We're on our own," I said as I offered him a pistol.

"Jesus! What the fuck are you doing with that thing?"

"Self defense. Something like this was bound to happen sooner or later. I felt it coming, so I prepared."

"You can't be serious. Put that down before you hurt someone. We just need to figure this out. Those are *people* down there!"

I put the gun back in my belt. "Come with me." Mike stared, unmoving. "I'll show you. You don't believe me? I'll show you real monsters." The tone in my voice didn't leave room for argument. Mike went to the next room to wake Casey.

"She's not moving!" he shouted. "Something's wrong with her, she's not waking up!"

As he knelt over her unconscious body, I quickly struck him on the back of the skull. A half hour later, he found himself on top of the roof.

"You're sick," he said.

"No, I'm not. And neither are you. They are, though." I gestured to the pirhanal masses below. "They're not human anymore, Mike. They're gone."

"Ca- where's Casey?" He tried to stand with numb legs.

"Casey's gone, Mike. I saw that bite. They're all gone. There's only one thing left to do." 




 I think that's Human_Gravy_Gravy. It's good on biscuits. 




 "God, why does this shit happen to me?" Malcolm drunkenly shouted, splattering the lid, seat, tank, floor, walls with the evicted debris from his bowels. A two foot chili dog, one gallon milkshake and hours of the worst beer that this hole-in-the-wall bar had to offer had created a deadly chemical reaction. He'd started with the hover -- the toilet was probably the worst in the Western Hemisphere, but had since achieved lift-off.

He clenched so long and hard that he nearly passed out. As his vision returned, mind empty of all thought, the words at the end of the long black tunnel were impressed upon his brain.

*"Don't worry. There are plenty of fish in the sea."*

Fog slowly cleared from his mind, and Malcolm recalled the fit brunette he'd been trying to catch the attention of at the bar outside. Clearly, an exercise in futility. He checked that the coast was clear before abandoning the stall. 

*I'd take just about any kind of trout at this point,* he thought as we washed his hands in the sink.

Behind him, someone went rushing into the stall-slash-gateway-to-hell-on-Earth. "God, why does this shit happen to me?" said the newcomer.

Malcolm left that night with a slightly overweight blonde that he hadn't given a second look at before. Their shared affinity for food, Netflix and video games made them friends first and lovers second. Each fell hard and fast for the other, spending nearly every day of that week together. 

It was going to last. 

When the weekend came back around, they agreed to meet up at the watering hole that had brought them together. Too many Jger Bombs, and Malcolm found himself back in the stall. He was getting sleepy, and his aim was failing. On a drunken whim, he decided to back away from the bowl. He chuckled as he shot 50% from the line.

As he shook the last drops onto the floor, he noticed a new addition to the artwork on the walls.

*"Choose a job you love, and youll never have to work a day in your life."*

The gears of Malcolm's mind fell into place, lubricated by the words of his unknown mentor. He hated his job. Why do that to himself? The blocked portal of waste suddenly became a metaphor for his life -- down the drain.

Someone in a hurry bumped Malcolm on his way back to the table. The blow spun him, directing his gaze to an orange paper sign hung over the bar.

*"Bar for Sale."*

This could work.

After a month, Malcolm was living his dream. He'd purchased the bar, and it was pulling in more business than ever. Everything was flowing smoothly -- everything but the third stall toilet. He'd hung signs, of course, but you can't expect sloshed patrons on their way to give the old heave-ho to stop and read.

Still, he hated cleaning it. The putrid stink burned through his facemask. He nearly yakked himself. Through watery eyes, he saw new words scratched into the stall.

*"No need to worry. It will all be over soon"*

"Thanks, pal," he whispered to the air. 




 *I* should? It sounds like you've got it all figured out!

Edit: Okay. 




 I was thinking *Awesome, the_itch wrote a straightforward zombie story,* until "the undead screamed."

I pictured it on top of a shopping mall too. Maybe a Black Friday turned red? 




 ~~Fuck~~ Thank you very much! 




 Check out /r/nosleepworkshops for that! 




 Thanks! Exactly what I'd hoped to hear! 




 *(Today)*

I didn't kill my daughter. I didn't.

I understand, that when these things happen, you've got to look at the father, but you've got to believe me when I say I did not kill her.

This is all a... tragic accident. She must've found my gun, must've been playing with it in her room.

*Sobs*

Sorry, I can't do this right now.

*(Yesterday)*

Today's the day.

Since Janine died last year, things have been getting worse and worse.

I can't stand the little brat. So entitled. So goddamned needy. Well, what about my needs, huh?

If she thinks that I've made her life hell, then she hasn't considered what it's like to have to live with her. This whole pile of shit just poured into my lap -- I didn't even want kids! That was Janine's thing.

She's ready now. Over this last year, I've worn her down. 

Such a soft... 

weak... 

*coward*.

I'm not going to kill her. I don't have to.

Today I gave her the gun. 




 Spy! Who are you working for? 




 Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us. 




 I have my phone chime every half hour to keep track of time. Oh yeah. 




 Thanks!

He was reasonably worried about exposure, especially in the long term. The young scientist was feeling better about his decision already. He could picture them, homeless, huddled cold and starving under the overpass near the park. The two serums clinked as he put them into his Velcro pocket. Two subjects. If he was right, one of them wouldn't spend another day down on the planet's harsh surface. And the other... Well...
