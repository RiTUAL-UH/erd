 I can imagine that some users want their content to take off so bad that they downvote all above and below them on the 'new' page.  




 Thank you! 




 I just think this would be a really good way to disappoint a redditor.  




 I'm the hacker that fucked this all up. 




 Because it's an anti joke. 




 I predict that there will be some users that submit the survey more than once. I highly doubt there are users that are going to sit in front of this survey and fill it out 100 times.  




 You know, I'm not experiencing this. I just sorta came up with it. :) 




 Is there a similar website like ZenniOptical that you use for contacts that can get them to you at a low price? 




 The knife that went through it.  




 Thank you! 




 You PM him/her over a period of months until you gain their trust. You find out that they actually live in the same city as you, in fact, just a couple of blocks down. You share pictures of yourselves with each other, slowly piecing together your independent lives. You find that you have similar interests including vast collections of fedoras, novelty swords, and NES cartridges. You muster up the courage to let them know you have feelings for them. You find that they share the same feelings towards you. You share more intimate photographs with each other leading into ending every night with a message in your inbox that says "Goodnight, I love you, I can't wait to meet you."

You decide to take the initiative and set up a date together. You invite them out to the local Hilton restaurant for a fancy meal followed by a night out on the town on Monday, April 20th, 2015 at 6:00pm Central Standard Time.

You wait until the eve of that fateful night and never leave your driveway.  




 BOOO CAPTIONS 




 Yes, but what are the ratios and cooking instructions? 




 Don't pick it up bare handed!!!!

There is a flesh-eating bacteria that is present on those chunks!  




 Yeah!

I was a little curious after the shampoo washed out of my hair, down my face, and into my mouth. It was very salty!  

Then I noticed that the shower gel is the same consistency! Naturally, I was curious about its taste so I tried it to compare. SAME FLAVOR, super salty!  

That's when I looked at the ingredients. They are the same!   

Yes, I could've skipped the second try but some minds work differently from others. 




 Yeah, I just found out that the Internet on campus is sluggish today. Sorry about that! 




  monoprice.com

Goddamn reddit hug... 




 I have a business proposal for all of you worried about the change:  


Step 1: Buy all the Kraft Mac   Cheese you can **NOW**  
Step 2: Wait a couple of months after the new mac hits the shelves  
Step 3: Sell your stockpile at a premium  
Step 4: Profit. 




 If you don't mind me asking, I have been trying to get into the IT world. How did you do it?    

Any sort of special classes you took? I already have my bachelor's degree (in history) but I am great with computers. Like, I do IT work in my office for my coworkers. 




 You seem to know your bugs.

Would you mind informing me what kind of bug is in this amber I found? 

http://youtu.be/fieTpX7DQE8

It's legit amber too. It was partially encased in rock and I cleaned up the stone. 




 I don't understand 




 Not really. 




 I can tell you this by experience. The body wash and shampoo of Spa-Haus taste the same. I then looked at the ingredients... the same.  




 Not sure why you're being downvoted... it completely ruined it! 









 Plus, how long am I supposed to leave it in the hot water?  




 It's because their last emperor's surname was Nguyen and it changing your family surname to match was respectful.

[Source](http://www.ibtimes.com/why-are-so-many-vietnamese-people-named-nguyen-1556359)

By the early 19th century century, the Nguyen Dynasty seized power in Vietnam (which unified the country), prompting yet another wave of surname changes and adoptions. That dynasty, which "awarded" their surname to many people, ruled the country until the end of World War II. Esther Tran Le, a Vietnamese-American journalist based in New York, said that the name Nguyen was the last name of the last dynasty of Vietnamese emperors. Apparently the last King's name was Bao-Dai, but his real name was Nguyen-Vinh-Thu, she said. Many of the Vietnamese [peoples] last names derive from the former Emperors' last names. 




 Reminds me of the Game of Thrones intro. 




 I'd call you all up and we'd have a giant circlejerk while listening to that song.

Kind of like right now. 




 Where did you see thin? 




 You'll never forget her.

You WILL learn to be okay with that.  




 This is the most finicky subreddit.  




 Hey Gordon!  

You should visit my town sometime and slap some sense into restaurant owners around here. I swear we are becoming the burger joint capitol of the work. I think we have at least 13 mom-and-pop burger places for our 40,000 people.  

A taco joint shut down and now someone bought the building and is turning it into ANOTHER BURGER PLACE...  

We have no diversity! It's all burgers or Latin American food!  

Sherman, TX. Future world record holder in burger places per capita. 
 




  "thank mr skeltal" to this message and spread it to 3 more circlejerk posts!

 









 Or we just don't want to take part in a giant circlejerk about it.  









 Show some empathy. 




 I feel the same way! 

It sounds like "ker thump" and then picks back up again! 




 What brought you to DC, what kind of job did you have, why did you decide to leave? 




 I think you are mistaken.  




 Before reddit Lemur was just 'mur'. 









 I hate having to need a car! Mine is a run down piece of shit. 

I have a 4 year degree in history and I'm fluent in Spanish. Any way to get there and make it?  




 "Don't worry, we can fix the broken paw with an arrow through the head!" 




 Where'd you see that? 




 I ANAL? What does your sexual stimulation preference have to do with this!? 




 They are two factions in a game called "The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim".

You can choose to join either faction.  




 What did you choose? I chose the mayo. 




 WOOP! IT'S THERE! Thanks! 




 I just shrekd all over myself. 




 Hold up, are you saying that my iPhone 6 can also film at 60fps? 




 It was the sketch of the internet being a physical location. 




 Trickle down economics and the war on drugs.... 




 When he is on his deathbed about to have his final breath; whisper into his ear:

"I had gay sex with my boyfriend in your house." 




 Great question!

Honestly, I'm not sure about the IP address. I would assume no. What I meant by that in the post is that there is a survey site we were considering that had an option to only allow one vote from one IP address. 

This poses an issue when it comes to schools and business. Effectively one vote can determine an entire school's opinion. We wanted to avoid that. 




 PLS 




 Hello /r/gifs users! 

We've been receiving a lot of mod mail from you all regarding 'Power Users' (i.e. those who post content to /r/gifs 20-30 times a day). The complaint stems from other users' inability to submit content to our subreddit and collect the karma that these posts accumulate. 

We've decided to create a survey and let you all decided if we should enact a post limit for users. 

Please take five minutes out of your day to answer! There are two  questions that are mandatory and the rest are silly questions we've come up with to get to know our user base a little better.

The survey is open for all to submit answers to but **PLEASE ONLY SUBMIT IT ONCE**. We had the option to use a feature that only allows one vote from an IP address or allows only users with a Google account to vote BUT we decided that these features would hinder our users' votes. 

**[LINK TO SURVEY](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1otfolOwCvjhUVtLo8lwvO5z3iZGWjkCm43b2XrMqIy8/viewform?usp=send_form)**

Thank you so much for your participation in this community and survey. It means a lot!

Sincerely,

test_subject4255

EDIT: I guess I should have mentioned a date at which the polling ends. How about a week from today? 

Polling ends 4/23/2015 at 12:00pm Central Standard Time. 

EDIT 2: **POLLING HAS ENDED. RESULTS WILL BE GIVEN SOON** 




 Gosh, I'm not great with the lingo. 

When the song starts you hear "da da da daaaaaa daaaaa da da daaaaa daaaa daaa"

Know what I mean? 




  HIS IceQ 7870

Wow! How much are you asking? 




 Who is that? Where did you see that? 




 I thought he was the one singing the "das" 









 ABC [Texoma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texoma) 




 It used to be called the 'I So Pale Ale' and then they changed it, no? 




 Oh yeah, duh! Thanks! 




 link us! 




 I don't think OP claimed to have seen it.  




 I once tried to download an episode of Chappelle's Show but instead got the Paris Hilton sex tape.  




 Is Buzzfeed spilling over? All these clickbate titles... 









 I usually bitch about captions but I think this gif is an exception. Great job! 




 I think we should just confiscate all guns. No guns = no illegal selling of the weapons, no confusion whether or not you're holding a taser, no gun related deaths.  




 Please give me some sources that say more white men are shot/killed by police than black men.  




 But it does! You don't see white men getting shot by police.  




 Idk, maybe he was afraid? Fight or flight? 

Doesn't warrant a death sentence.  




 I don't understand. Why would you shoot the guy if he's being held to the ground? Taser or not?  




 Comments are in response to posts.  




 Corey Stoll should've been cast as Lex Luthor.  




 ~~If you ever let anyone shoot a firearm for the first time, full auto or not. ALWAYS LOAD ONE ROUND. That way they can see if the will be able to control the recoil without endangering themselves or others around them.~~

How about we just not let children play with firearms?  




 [The MENSA one was pretty funny too!](http://www.adultswim.com/videos/the-eric-andre-show/mensa-convention/)  




 That's the beauty of it.  




 That donut looked like it was made of plastic. 




 Neat. 




 And where is the bidet?  




 BOOOO, waste of time. 




 He's preventing others from getting their food by acting like a child. I think the manager was calling him out on his bullshit because nobody else will.  




 Not really. 




 Just all of a sudden. 




 Bullshit, he's just trying to get the reddit vote.

 




 My toenails are kinda cool in the sense that they will grow to a point and stab the toenail next to it. If I don't trim them, they start killing my other toes. 









 I want to stand in it.  




 So this is what /r/combinedgifs will be for some time, that seen from GoT mixed with other scenes from different films/TV shows...

I see it now. 









 Weird, it's like every time there's a cop that murdered an innocent black man reddit has a post on the front page the next day that shows a cop doing a good deed. 

Stop trying to change the subject.  




 "iShit" here 




 I call that folder 'iShit' 




 BOOO CAPTIONS! 




 Ask the grill man! 




 The show sucks 

Come at me bro 




 Redditors are salty. 




 Probably America.  




 I don't get it. 




 Where'd you hear that? 




 Wtf is the point of all the old clips? They add nothing. 




 What's the last thing that was cooked on you? 




 HOLY CRAP THAT IS EXPENSIVE! 




 What game is he playing? 




 Link me!!! 




 Fookin' noice wan. 




 What middle school did you go to? I recall a similar experience.  




 Attach a hair dryer to the bowl! 




 Inside out bacon socks with soap smeared on the front and earplugs provided by the hotel. 

It's going to be a long day tomorrow. 

Yes, I called the front desk. No other rooms are available and they are comping my night. 




 And the canned laughter! I don't need to be reminded when to laugh at a joke! Well, with that show, not even canned laughter could make me chuckle.  




 BOOOOOOO CAPTIONS! 




 Sooooooooooo??? Did you get canned?  




 their friend* 




 WELL DONE! No captions! :D 




 I swear every other gif on this subreddit is 'how a gun works'

WE GET IT.  




 hahahaha 




 Time to initiate Helios One.  




 It was a thing that maybe happened 2-3 times.  




 As a former dumb. What were we talking about again?

 [REQUEST] GTA V


I know. It's posted as a request nonstop. Let me tell you why I'm different! I'm not.

I just simply don't have the money to purchase a game that I know I will enjoy. I've been a huge fan of the franchise and put a lot of hours into GTA: San Andreas when I had it for Xbox. I never really appreciated GTA: IV because I'm a big fan of flying airplanes and I feel like Liberty City is confined.

San Andreas has been my favorite one out of the series because of its size and GTA: V is the closest sequel that mimics it. I want to rob stores, steal fighter jets, take flying lessons, etc. and I know this game will offer it all to me.

Plus, my SO would be ecstatic considering we first connected with her love of driving down sidewalks.

Thank you for considering me. 

http://steamcommunity.com/id/jrockbarn/ 




 I like it! It's a little dark though and the NPCs are hard to hear.  




 [A lot of people](https://www.google.com/search?q=reversible+raincoat safe=off rlz=2C1KMZB_enUS0537US0537 es_sm=93 biw=1366 bih=643 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=5SwgVemgLoKSsAWX74DoDA ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg) 




 I just eat turds. They have already been processed so my body does less work in scavenging the precious vitamins and minerals left behind from the previous tenant. I've refined it so much that I've stopped shitting, there is nothing left to process. The 'waste not diet' is the one you should really be on.  




 It took me about 3-4 weeks to get over my sugar withdrawals. It's crazy. You'd have to experience it to believe me.  




 I get where you are coming from. Yes, it is a disgusting thing. 

If you just try and realize what conditions need to be like for you to willfully take the life of endangered species maybe you'd see that it's probably not what they want to do but is what they must do in order to survive.

On the same note, there is a market for what they do. If you destroy the demand the supply will go with it. This is something that the Chinese government is trying to work on. 




 You came off as super critical of his actions.  




 Learn how to empathize. Put yourself in his shoes. I wouldn't be able to think straight. I'd probably be crying and trying to hug the fireman.

It's getting old.  




 Idk, I would've been hugging the shit out of that guy.
