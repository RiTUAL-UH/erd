 How do you match up with people then? I built an army of 40k soldiers, 20k archers and 30k Knights and I've still been wiping the board clean at nation level with those numbers and now I'm at less than half of all those and still winning  




 Here's a direct link to the group. This should be in the sidebar IMO

 Wait, what? What's the source on this?  




 This is what I always did. I felt like I was too tired to really get anything done on my first day off so it was more of a recuperate and be lazy day 




 I'm the same exact way. My wife gets pissed because I'm making a mess but she doesn't understand that I do things in steps. Usually I'm throwing stuff together that's going to sit in the oven for at least 20 minutes except if it's pizza. Then I have all that time to clean everything up. I clean when I have time to lean 




 Most places I've worked at had pretty strict policy about cameras on their property  




 I bought a big bag of parmesan the other day because it's cheaper to buy in bulk. I use enough of it that I don't like buying in small amounts but I don't go through it fast enough to use it without freezing it. So I sat there and portioned all the parmesan into smaller freezer bags so it doesn't go bad. I felt like I should be back in a restaurant doing morning prep before we open 




 Uh oh, I used to work at a sandwich shop that got deliveries through them.  




 Why dig up rabbit holes? Doesn't that destroy the hole and then no more rabbits? I just make a bunch of traps and lay them on top of holes and when I come back I usually end up with an entire inventory of rabbits  




 My wife and I started playing with her brother and while each of us are not bad at the game by ourselves, we don't seem to be the best at doing it together. The wife died three times, and her brother and I died once. She survived the rest of the first winter just barely and was able to revive me and that's where we are now. 

I've been trying to focus on food supply but I'm finding it difficult to feed 3 people. I've been trapping rabbits like crazy but I haven't been able to build any kind of food surplus, we're always just barely getting by at the end of the day. I have two bee boxes but I don't want to use the honey because adding one honey to any of the recipes with a morsel makes honey nuggets which isn't nearly as filling as meatballs. I haven't really found a good way to get full sized meat to make honey ham 




 It's the only entrance to the living room area so we at least need to be able to move it easily. Something that's at least as high as the couch seat and he can't push it out of the way 




 Unfortunately we don't have a table so the breakfast nook is all we have for a place to eat besides the couch. We have smaller wooden barstool type chairs but he was able to grab onto one of those and pull then over because they're so light. The pool noodle is a good idea, I think one of those should cover all the ends 




 Our living room is pretty secure but the only thing that remains keeping him in here is a gap between the couches at a 90 degree angle. For a little while we had a little bouncer seat we'd turn sideways and that would keep him in here but now he figured out how to move it because it's pretty light. 

[here's the spot in question] ( http://www.imgur.com/HEQUazQ.jpeg) 

As you can see he heads straight to the rod iron chair which happens to be where our cat likes to store his toys at. I think by the time he's old enough to jump up onto the couch and get off the other side we'll be more okay with him wandering the kitchen, my only worry would be him falling on those rod iron chairs, but they have been in the wife's family for a long time and have been through 6 babies/kids 




 As a husband who works 5am to 3-4pm Mon-fri, I envy your position. I'm not saying it's easy, but it on weekends I generally am the primary caretaker for our son and I love spending the time with him. It's far more enjoyable than being gone 10 hours a day and being exhausted (physical job)  when I get home. I'd rather be hanging out with him all day 




 It just seems like any time I see posts like this on on reddit, it's filled with condescending comments about how bitcoin is the future and this will never be an issue with bitcoin. I suppose maybe it's different because this is /r/Android. Don't get me wrong, I'm a proud supporter of bitcoin and I've done a fair share of mining, but I just hate seeing people be douches about it 




 I'm not sure. Clans seems to fill up pretty quick. I wouldn't mind being in one but I don't have the dedication some of these crazy people have 




 So you just keep your screen on all night?  




 I'm wondering if he meant 1 week after researching it. Sounds more reasonable but still crazy 




 You're probably being booted from the clan. I guess some clans are trying to be competitive to get the most skulls by the end of the week to earn the 10k gold or whatever  




 Starting from nothing? Good god man 




 I've been playing for about a week, have almost. 200k population but I am less than 1% of the way to the wonder. At this point it's hard to build my population, my max food isn't enough to make 10k population, so obviously I'm building 10k barns at a time, but I'm only able to do 10k pop the first time after the barns go up, then it's immediately not enough 




 I'd go with food. I'm not even close to getting a winder yet, but I have about 197k citizens and over 100k of then have to be working on damn farms so everyone doesn't starve 




 I prefer wangnumber 




 I was almost expecting to see the bitcoin brigade all over this thread

 Damn, filled already  




 He goes through a few stages. First he babbles and rolls around, then he takes his pacifier and starts banging it on the sides of the crib. Sometimes he throws the pacifier out of the crib or drops it down the back side which sends him into the second stage. If he's still holding the pacifier he'll start getting upset that it's not in his mouth and he'll also start rubbing the crap out of his eyes and then move onto stage 2. 

Stage 2 is more rolling activity, even more eye rubbing and moans and groans that slowly climb in their volume and intensity

Stage 3 comes after the breaking point of stage 2 and now he's crying but not CRYING. This stage will also rise in intensity until the next stage

The last stage is inconsolable crying and hyperventilating. 

He will successfully climb through these stages by himself without assistance or intervention, and sometimes even if we are patting him on the or talking to him he still may get to stage 4. I can count on one hand how many times he has gone to bed peacefully. By far the best time was when we were visiting his grandparents and it was near bedtime when we were coming home so we changed him into his jammies there. He cried on the way home but fell asleep in his car seat. I was able to successfully get him out of the car seat without waking him up and transfer him to his crib. But I don't think car rides right before bed is a habit I want formed 




 His wake up time is around 8 or so. He'll eat around 830-9, then nap time around 10, lunch at noon, nap around 2, and dinner between 430-5. Then around 8 is bath time if he needs one, then he gets his last bottle while he gets read a bedtime story and he's in the crib by 9. It has been that routine since he was 2 months basically and he still won't go down easily for naps or bed time 




 He'll start rolling and moving around, sometimes sitting up. If he isn't rolling around and he's on his tummy, he will refuse to lay his head down. Then he starts making sound, moans and groans at first. Then it turns to a whining cry, then an actual cry, and it progresses like that until he's plugged up his nose with snot, and either hyperventilating or screaming the most wretched scream you've ever heard. That's if we leave him to his own devices. But sometimes being there and patting him or talking to him also makes him upset. This kid just does NOT want to sleep.  




 My son is coming up on 10months and he's great during the day but nights are a spectacle to behold. Putting him down to sleep is worthy of a competition for who can do it the fastest. We've had the same exact bedtime routine since he was 2 months and he's not any better at going to bed or for naps now as he was then. He does nothing but fight it and refuses to self sooth. I've looked up sleep training but I don't see anything different with that than what we've already been trying. Once he's asleep, he almost always sleeps until morning but if for any reason he wakes up in the middle of the night, he will not go back to sleep for any reason. He does not sleep like a baby, he sleeps like a Vietnam War veteran with one eye open and the other on his pistol on the nightstand 




 I hope he didn't try to eat it by holding the stick. I'm imagining the molten hot pocket filling squirting out of the bottom with each bite  









 Yay nepotism!

 The 623s run a little under a half size too big for me so I have to get insoles for them. Other than that, my only complaint is the lack of support for keeping my heel in the shoe 




 This thread upsets me because I really like the look of the 623s. They're the only sneakers I've found that don't look gaudy and awful. I really like the blue 623v2s 




 You have 3 unopened pairs of women's 587's? 




 Are you shitting me? I got a pair of 623s a few years ago (looks similar to those) because they were the only non-gaudy sneakers I could find. Got another pair after those wore out and then after that pair wore out, I saw they came out with a color variant and [I got myself a pair of those] ( http://s7d5.scene7.com/is/image/NB/mx623nv2_nb_14_i?$dw_temp_default_gallery$) that I think looks really nice. 

Also the shoes you linked are women's  




 That truly would have been a sight to behold  




 I'm governed to 65 on cruise. I don't want to take it off cruise and slow down just because the guy in front of me is going slightly slower than me.

 I'm here as well. I got banned on justiceporn because at one point someone posted a picture of ice with the title "mods are asleep post just ICE porn". A bunch of people including myself joined in. Woke up the next morning with a message that I've been banned. I guess some mod got a justice boner from banning everyone taking part in a fun joke. That was several months ago, last week I sent them a message asking if I could get unbanned and no response from them

 I want to like the Giant Bomb podcast but it's way too damn long for me. I listen to podcasts while I drive for work which amounts to about 10.5 hours per week and I don't like to have just one podcast take up 3-4 hours of that time. Especially when they talk about wrestling or Dota for am hour 




 I'll refer you to my first sentence of my last post:

Laws don't always make sense. 

I did it for two years and never got in trouble and I had already knew what I would say if I was reprimanded in any fashion for looking out for my own safety.  




 Laws don't always make sense. Bikes on the road are no better than someone walking on the road as far as safety goes. I'd argue it's actually worse because there's less chance of a person suddenly swerving out in front of you to avoid a rock in front of them. When I rode a bike in Bozeman, I rode on the sidewalk because I don't want to be killed from behind by a car and if I were to run into a pedestrian, it is far less deadly than a car hitting me

 Fuck I was gilded last week 




 And today by far has been the worst of it. He has been incredibly difficult to feed, trying to squirm out of eating the solid foods and many times outright refusing his formula, and even if he does drink it, it will be like an ounce at a time on his own terms. He has always gotten 6oz of formula 4 times a day and he hasn't had a problem with it until very recently. 

On top of this, his sleep has never been worse. Putting him to bed at his normal time works fine but if he wakes up for any reason at all you might as well give up on getting sleep for the rest of the night because no matter how tired he is, he won't fall back asleep. For at least the last week he has been waking up 4 hours after getting put to bed and is up crying the rest of the night unless you give up and take him downstairs and let him be awake. He's cranky all day long because he's tired and yet he refuses to sleep and even naps are half hour if you're lucky. We both are at a complete loss at what to do

 Finding a car seat that will fit in that space that our truck allows. We thought that a quad cab would be a happy medium in size.

 This kind of stuff sucks for everyone involved. Sysco, USF, AND FSA drivers are all worked like dogs and as a result don't do proper pre-trips on their trucks, are always in a rush, can never arrive on a regular schedule because of the volume of stops they have each day and can also cause them to have negative attitudes, which is only worsened by being chewed out at every stop. I sympathise and empathise with both parties as I have both worked in kitchens and I am currently a delivery driver of the beverage variety. My job is difficult but it looks like a cakewalk compared to Sysco. I talked to the Sysco driver that delivers to one of the grocery stores I deliver to, and during the summer it's common for him to be out at 4am and still not be done with all his stops by 7pm. Fuck. That. Shit. 

As for sales reps, if they are fucking up orders then fuck them. That part of the job is easy as shit.
