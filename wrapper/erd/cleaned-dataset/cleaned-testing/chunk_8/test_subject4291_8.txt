 Nice use of color and motion! 









 One Dozen Eyes - Island 




 I noted in the description that I'm trying to find alternatives, like day-care or walkers. I have time outside of work to take care of it, and I understand it can't be left alone for 10 hours. So, would taking it to day-care while I'm at work be sufficient? 




 What kinds of stories, if you don't mind my asking? 




 Right, absolutely. Thanks :) 




 I'm definitely planning to rescue an adult (don't feel like dealing with having to look after a hyper/destructive puppy).
So hypothetically, if I could run with my Husky for 2 hours after work, would that be sufficient? I don't think I can leave it alone for 10 hours... 

As for dog walkers, what would be the best way to go about that? Have the walker take the Husky for a walk or two every day while I'm at work? 




 Well, on the weekends, sure I could run with it (maaaaybe not 50 miles). But during the weekdays, isn't that what the day-care would be for? 




 ... good one 




 So I really want a Husky, but I'll be working full-time soon, meaning I'd be out of the house close to 10 hours per day. It's also not a big house, and has no fenced-in yard.

What can I do to make getting a Husky possible? Would taking it to a doggy day-care every weekday be okay for the dog? 




 I want an energetic dog that I can run with. I also think bigger dogs are adorable (which I acknowledge isn't the best reason for getting one). 




 I'm about to start working full time in a suburban area in Washington state; I'll be living alone and out of the apartment for 9-10 hours every weekday. I want a dog for companionship though, and am willing to do the needed grooming and exercising (1-1.5 hours per day), though I don't think I'll have a fenced-in yard.

I really want a Husky. I'd likely get an adult rescue (not a puppy); would it be too demanding?

Otherwise, other breeds I'd be interested in are Mastiffs, Australian Shepards or Shiba Inus. Would any of those suit my lifestyle better?


Edit: If I were to get a dog walker to walk the dog around midday (so the dog would never be alone for more than 4 hours or so), would a Husky be out of the question? 









 Just playing around I'm afraid. All of QC's scenes are (relatively) 'docile' 




 Her name's Ashley. The scene is from qualitycontrol.cc 









 Yeah, it's from QC. Excellent site.
