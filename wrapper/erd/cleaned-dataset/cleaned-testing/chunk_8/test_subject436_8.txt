 The question is whether this thing is going to choke on any kind of multitasking even though it's a 4-threaded CPU. For example, let's say I have several programs running at once: can I compile a program and watch Youtube without the machine stalling? Can I listen to Pandora or 8tracks in the background while I am doing work? The reason why this is an important question is because the OG Macbook Air was absolute shit at multitasking. 




 People have also been charged with dui for sleeping in their vehicle with the keys not in the ignition. 




 The problem is that the study is inconclusive and warrants more research (great!) but science writers were breathlessly jumping to conclusions without having read a single sentence of the actual article. That's really embarrassing, considering that a journal article costs ~$30 and takes a science journalist maybe a day to skim the intro, methods, and conclusions. I'm a scientist, and while I'm eager to learn about scientific topics outside of my expertise from the media, I'm starting to think that I should only read reports from the news sections of Nature and Science. 




 The fact that a huge percentage of Instagram accounts are public and you can hashtag anything for people to see makes it amazing. Like Twitter but without the noise. I posted a random picture of cupcakes that I had made one weekend and it had likes from random people across the world. Wouldn't happen with any other platform. 




 Can you think of any major ad-based social network (say, 1-10M+ users) that went under? Off the top of my head I can only think of Myspace and Friendster. Another one (Orkut) had a buyout exit from Google. By all accounts Twitter is doing fine too. 




 Yes, but a huge part of medical costs are independent of labor (eg. doctors). The doctors and nurses could plausibly take less pay, but how would you pay the bills for infrastructure, equipment, and drugs? 




 Pro tip: buy a Cuisinart ice cream maker and her ice cream recipe book. Has many of the flavors featured in the shops. 




 Rapid tooling is pretty popular nowadays. Big companies may outsource to these ones for their parts. The law stipulates a requirement for repairs and parts, so I think some kind of turnaround time is reasonable. 




 This is a non-issue. If the plaintiffs win, the subsidies will continue in "state-established" exchanges and the insurance companies will see their money from the federal government regardless. Red states that "opted out" will suddenly see millions of working and middle class people lose their subsidy overnight. Because the individual mandate hasn't been shot down, the only way out would be for (a) states to implement their own subsidy and hit their own budgets, or (b) to swallow their dignity, set up an exchange, and let the federal government foot the subsidy bill.

Either way it goes back to the status quo. I don't know why people make it out to be a doomsday scenario. So long as the individual mandate stands and people want health care, politicians will come up with a crafty scheme. 




 That number means less than you think. The Russian revolution (and others for that matter) that happened 100 years ago started with way less people. You just need a very determined group of people beyond a critical mass. The vast majority of the public just want to go on with their lives and don't care either way who is in charge. They may not necessarily agree with a revolution but they won't go out of their way to stop it either. 




 I think that depends on what your definition of "fine" is. From looking at the list of "post-Soviet" country, none of them would be considered a "failed state". None of them turned into a Middle East shitshow. That's pretty good, all things considered and also considering the whole Bosnia thing that was not too far away.

That said, Putin did improve the economy by quite a bit by using the muscle of oil. Can't really blame him for that, since that was basically Canada's MO for the past 20 years. The only problem was that he let the power go to his head and there was no real plan to diversify the economy. As Canada is now also learning, oil is great when it's booming but you don't want to depend on it. 




 That was what wolves did at first. They just started way before cats did. 









 There are a lot of physicians who end up recording by a recorder (tape, or digital) and having someone else transcribe later. This could end up saving a lot of time. I think primary care would also help by having a "medical scribe" be there to write down all information and what happens during the appointment so that the physician isn't distracted. Sure, it costs more but probably pennies compared to other things in health care. 




 You have to go much farther than that because people can paint guns however they want. If you want to address this specific issue then you have to outright ban toy guys that have any resemblance to a real gun. 




 The only way would be for the whole world to collectively stop resorting to violence as a first line response to conflict. This doesn't just apply to world governments, but everyday people. 




 Honestly, I don't see what was wrong with the deal. It is a paid app (already generating revenue), and $40k/15% is a steal for an app that people are already paying for. 




 Fluoride is one of the best things you can do with regards to the "risk to benefit ratio". You are very unlikely to overdose on fluoride except in really special circumstances. In terms of other things you can add to water, I would put minerals on top of the list. Some people really hate hard water, but I think it would go a long way and it's practically impossible to overdose on it. 




 I think it's ridiculous that things such as not disclosing funding sources can still happen. Virtually all institutions have an office of sponsored research that manages all incoming grants (to get a piece of that sweet overhead, amongst other things). It should be trivial for institutions to publicly disclose all grants that fund a particular researcher so that issues such as these will never come up. 




 I have a question that's been on my mind for some time. When I lived in Germany about a decade ago, the one thing that I noticed a lot was substantially less Roma people compared to other "Western European" countries (eg. France, Spain, Italy). Why is that? 




 How long ago was this? In the past two institutions that I've worked at lab credit cards basically didn't exist anymore. That or they were such a pain to use it was not worth the hassle. 




 Not to mention virtually all postal offices are understaffed. Labor is expensive, especially if they are unionized. Where are they going to get people to do all this extra work, and would revenues from banking pay for that kind of trouble? Consumer banking isn't exactly a growing industry. The only way this would make sense is if they had a "branchless" banking system. 




 I think the more incredible thing is to consider what other shit is happening. Think about it: the NSA are not the only players in this game. Every country with a major cyber budget is probably doing the same thing. At this rate I'm sure most computers in the world are hacked by one government or another. 




 You don't need to even cross-breed apples. Apple trees derived from a seed will look nothing like its parent. That's why many apple varieties are just grafts. 




 I mean, this is essentially a microwave:

 Also, wouldn't the microwaves interfere with the operation of an infrared camera? 




 Here's the thing. He's 52 and been with the Daily Show since 1999. He has more money than he needs. It's really the perfect age to retire if you have money because you have the health to do fun things with his family and the means to do so. I don't fault him for making that decision -- many people may worship him, but at the end of the day it's still just a job to him. In fact I applaud the fact that he arrived at this decision at his age, rather than at 70 years old and in poor health. 




 That really depends on a lot of factors. Because $35k/y is a pretty comfortable lifestyle, literally everything you make from whatever career you choose will be pure profit. I don't think most people who have that kind of funds sit around and do nothing. My guess is they would try to find new and unconventional ways to have more income because they wouldn't be bound by risk. 




 It would have to be ridiculously lower than a $30k car. How many people buy new cars? The price comparison should be towards used cars. 




 Is this an American thing? I am Chinese and grew up in Canada. By and large most Asian restaurants on Canada are pretty clean. But in the USA there seems to be a huge amount of really dirty ones alongside the nice ones. 




 Chinese Canadian here. There are literally millions of Asian restaurants who are able to make duck well without violating health and safety issues. Many of them are new to Western culture too.  




 Isn't 35 pretty mediocre when you take into account all fully developed and mostly developed countries into account? 




 The exceptions to the trend as described by OP have been the American and Canadian olympics. We've actually been doing quite a fantastic job of breaking even. 




 It's also pretty ridiculous, considering that alternatives to neonicotinoid pesticides are organophosphates which are way more toxic to pretty much every animal. 




 Here's the thing: industrial farming absolutely requires the use of pesticides. What are you going to use if you completely ban neonicotinoids? Go back to organophosphates? Keep in mind that neonics were developed because of toxicity in mammalian species. 




 Public health policies are by design somewhat against complete civil liberty. Because infectious diseases and their prevention is basically a public good, all citizens participating in society must take part otherwise it won't work at all. The only way to enforce rates of vaccine compliance at rates required for herd immunity requires the government to step in. You can't free market your way into 90%+ vaccination rates without some sort of involvement from the government. 




 It's kind of a bad article. Like you said, you could argue that the weight gain was solely caused by the absence of CD-related digestive issues. Suddenly she's absorbing a lot more calories, so she would naturally gain weight. Unless they adjusted her diet accordingly I don't see how they could come to the conclusion that there is such a thing as an "overweight" microflora. 




 Why are you making it hard for yourself? Just put nail polish or something similar on the cable's pins. 




 The question is why doesn't the US even try to attempt to convince the Saudi government to reign in their religious extremists? I'm convinced that there is a huge split between the Saudi government and their rich nutjobs, but why does it seem like nobody wants to do anything about it? The US government at least tries to help out Pakistan with their terrorist problems. 




 How about this: That 1% or 2% skim milk you're drinking is actually skim milk with the fat put back in. 




 Even better: The LA metropolitan area has a larger population than the combined population of every Canadian metro area with a population of over 1 million.  




 Because the intruder knows that you don't need great aim to defend yourself with a shotgun. 




 Actually, if flu vaccine supplies were not an issue, then having mandatory yearly flu shots would greatly reduce health care costs. 




 It's also ridiculous to think that humans were at the pinnacle of health and were perfectly evolved to be in dietary harmony with their environment. Except for very few cases, organisms have evolved to be just good enough to have offspring due to the dynamic nature of evolutionary forces. Ancient humans were eating to *survive*. 




 I think it helps to understand it from their perspective. You are basically the child of your godmother's sister. She must have suffered so much by losing her sister, and all of that trauma is wrapped up in her fear of losing you too. 




 It's pretty much the entire West coast of Canada and the US. I live in the richest area of the US and there are still problems with the homeless and mentally ill. People here easily have the resources to make a huge dent in terms of getting housing and health care for the homeless, but unfortunately by and large rich people don't want to contribute towards the public good. Another great proxy for this is that the roads here are literally falling apart, public transit is abysmal, and the streets are disgustingly dirty. 




 Chinese here. Lost the fucking lottery -- I have wet ear wax and my armpits smell. 




 Not to mention that all the irritation and ingrown hairs looks pretty gross. If you can pull it off, fine, but seeing red razor bumps makes me gag a little. 




 Yes, but even in protein purification preps for difficult proteins nobody would ever suggest an aggressive shear by vortexing. They would suggest denaturation but never anything outside of "mild" for refolding. 




 It's interesting, because in 99% of molecular biology labs you are taught to *in no uncertain terms* not shear your enzymes and proteins by vortexing them. 




 I don't know if this will help you feel better about the world, but here's a fun fact: the vast majority of relationships in this world have never had a problem with fidelity. If you have been cheated on multiple times, perhaps it is because you are dating very similar types of women that would increase these unfortunate odds by a lot. Try broadening your horizons! Date someone completely different than your usual "type"! You might be pleasantly surprised. 




 I'd just like to point out that the expectation of fidelity wasn't so insane throughout most of human history. There are plenty of genetic genealogical studies done that estimate levels of extramarital children (which is a proxy for infidelity) and it appears to be a rarity. Pair bonding was also one of the major evolutionary factors that set us apart from chimpanzees and made us pretty pacifist compared to them.

What is different today, however, is that in modern society there are probably more humans alive than all of history combined. That means the number of people you interact with is now vastly larger. Obviously that's a huge psychological and sexual pressure that is being tested today and I don't think anyone really knows the answer to that yet. Today, it still seems like the vast majority of relationships have no problems with fidelity. We do hear more about alternative relationships, but that could also be due to easier modes of self-reporting and people just being more transparent about their lifestyles.  




 I think a lot of people assume that narcissism is synonymous with having a huge ego. A lot of times it is actually manifested as crippling insecurity. 




 Well, they did dump nuclear waste off the SF bay for a while. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farallon_Islands 




 Not quite. They'll still make plenty of money from Enterprise customers. They realized that they could sacrifice a little bit of revenue to bring everyone up to a newer release, and make up for it in other revenue streams. 




 Think bigger. Imagine remote assistance for surgeries. Telesurgery with the camera on the HoloLens to an outside team.

Anything that requires logistics will benefit greatly from this. Imagine a Search and Rescue team with these headsets! 




 The big issue is that the "social benefit" of these satellites rapidly declines as countries improve. You are spending a fuckton of money for something that is unsustainably expensive to maintain and improve. Once developing countries get off the ground, they will demand better/faster internet. They will start building their own cell towers for mobile broadband. After a very short period of time these hundreds or thousands of satellites will become completely obsolete for any useful application.

Contrast this with a vaccine that costs pennies or drugs for malaria. Your "social ROI" is way better because you spent very little and gained a lot. You basically spent pennies for literally 60 years of productivity. You can't say that about ho-hum satellites.

Google and SpaceX are playing the philanthropic angle, but it's all PR. It's a PR move for SpaceX to show their capabilities. 




 I've been here for a long time. I remember when getting 100 karma for a comment was a big deal. A thread with 1k+ comments was pretty rare. Now both of these are regular occurrences.

Edit: There were also *a lot* more Ron Paul fans back then too.

Second edit: I'm pretty sure memes like f7u12 and advice animals played a big part in how reddit transformed through the years. 




 Probably a great VR application too. 




 Holy shit, I tried explaining this to some people, who reply with "If I use my turn signal then people will immediately box me in!" WTF? 




 There seems to be a lot of small molecule inhibitors with great results recently. I wonder if people will now follow this route more than trying to make antibodies against cancer genes? 




 I fucking wish the USA and Canada would have something even resembling a European Doener kebab. I lived in a tiny Franconian city a decade ago and I still have dreams about them. The "shawarma" here doesn't even come close. 




 Where in the Bay Area are you living? There are decent 2br apartments in Palo Alto and Mountain View that are way less than $5k/m. I guess you prefer a house but given that most places here have tiny yards, I don't think the cost differential is worth it. 




 Not sure why you're being downvoted! A real question would be how animals are treated before slaughter for meat. There are probably more people in India who would look down upon the entire North American continent for eating cows. People should really watch the South Park episode about dolphins and whales before passing judgment. And this is speaking as an Asian living in North America for practically his whole life. People eat what they eat. 




 I think there's a big difference between the protesters' expectations versus fundamental realities. Their expectation is that sudden shocks to people's routines will magically make them follow your cause. That's just a lot of magical thinking. I sincerely believe that idealists have a moral obligation to be pragmatic, because then otherwise all you will do is alienate or cause people to take extreme positions for or against you. 

Sure, if you block traffic you will be able to bring some attention to your cause, but if at the same time you make 80% of the people you affect take an extreme position against you then you are actively doing harm to what you want to achieve. 

If you want real systemic change, what you really want is to *change opinions*. If your mode of protest achieves the exact opposite then you are really just being selfish and acting out on what I would describe to be "instant gratification" activism. 

Activists really need to ask themselves some hard questions: what do they want to achieve from their actions? What are their concrete goals? If what they do does not realistically move the needle towards them, then maybe they should sit down a while longer and hash out some better ideas. I'm not saying that disruption is necessarily a bad idea, but it is applied in many cases where it completely backfires. Especially when you are talking about a city like Boston, where the racial problems are not even comparable to other "big cities" like LA, Chicago, or NYC. 




 Also, most blacks in the USA have little connection to Africa aside from skin color. They're more American by descent than most whites in this country. Why would anyone call them African in the first place? 




 Your point may have been valid 10 years ago, but bandwidth today is so cheap to deploy and the "pipes" are so wide that it is extremely hard to get significant amounts of network congestion that is caused by your neighbors. Cable internet (DOCSIS) is so ridiculously fast for the average home user there is no reason to even have tiered pricing. 




 If you order from Thorlabs you get a nice box of snacks! 




 Or that's a really tiny child's guitar. 




 I don't know why you're being downvoted. Microsoft can implement exactly the same approach for Windows with regards to updates or state autosaving. They just choose not to. 




 If they were all about good intentions then all they would have needed to do is implement a version of the "dead man switch". You have to come back after winding it up for X minutes. If you don't your car gets towed. The switch gets reset when the car leaves so you can't wind it up forever and leave it for the next person.  




 If you are doing the quick and dirty DNA extraction with NaOH/EDTA, then you will absolutely need to neutralize with Tris before you put it into the PCR. Unless you diluted the extraction by a ton then the NaOH is going to interfere with the PCR.

Also, everything I say doesn't really matter if you got the genotype that you were looking for. Did you use any +/- controls for mouse tails with known genotypes in the same DNA prep and PCR reaction? 




 What are you doing with the DNA afterward? If your DNA is purified, having it being extremely alkaline doesn't do anything except denature it and so it will still be good for PCR. EDTA at pH 8.0 doesn't do anything bad or degrade the sample. 




 I thought seasons 3-5 were the best ones. Season 3 was when it started to turn into a real spy drama with a large overarching plot, and 4-5 got quite good. I started watching from the first episode and was pretty happy that it matured into a pretty cool show. All things considered, the finale was pretty much the best that anyone could ask for. Most shows don't even attempt to wrap anything up. 




 Honestly, ingrown hairs, red bumps, and stubble burns are way less attractive. I think hairless looks great but very few people can pull that off without all the irritation and maintenance.  




 Honestly, as a guy it doesn't really matter as long as you pick one or the other and stick to it. Stubble is the worst feeling in the world, but grown leg hair is actually quite fine and soft. My girlfriend doesn't shave her legs and it has never weirded me out. 









 WHO ARE YOU 




 So in hindsight which is harder? The physical pain of the injury or the pain of withdrawal? 




 PhDtephen, if it were at a Starbucks. 




 It's almost as if there should be an entity that negotiates health care prices on behalf of citizens..... 




 Nice job. Did you take a look yet at the mega-special on avians in the recent issue of Science? http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6215/1308 




 I lived in Franconia for a while about a decade ago and all toilets were like in OPs picture. 




 I don't understand how this makes the news. North Korea says this literally every single year on January 1st. In fact, I'd be surprised if they didn't say anything. 




 The problem is: what will they call it? The name has to be easy enough for regular folks to understand that it's an internet browser (ie. many people have no idea what Firefox or Chrome are). It will need to have the word "internet","web", or "browser" in the name. 




 Anecdotal, but I live in Palo Alto -- where Macs dominate the entire surrounding 10 mile radius -- and the Microsoft Band is sold out. 




 No, it was because many developers were lazy shits and did an OS check for "Windows 9" hoping they would hit the 9X versions. 




 As a case example: imatinib was originally developed to treat CML, which is by most interpretations a very rare cancer. Novartis made fucking boatloads of money. 




 Wouldn't the natural solution be to strip all police units of militarized equipment and outsource it to a new unit of the National Guard? You could even make it such that the police have to pay, with city money, the National Guard every time they need a SWAT/armed unit (you could even charge really high prices). It would slow down the knee jerk "send out the guns" police responses, and make the police really think about whether they have the money to do it.

Secondarily, the "lack of professionalism" in police forces comes right down to lack of accountability. In the military, you are punished and/or dismissed. You are afraid of your superior officers. You are afraid of the enemy. In the police force, you're unionized so it's practically impossible to get fired without it being a huge bureaucratic mess. Citizens are generally unarmed and can't do shit to you. DA offices also have unlimited power to prosecute. 




 Not to mention the USSR was driven largely in part by "extracted resources" from satellite states and the resulting trade with them. Things like food and raw materials. Russia has none of that, doesn't have a great manufacturing sector, and is frozen out of capital markets from international sanctions. 

Wars are expensive. Invading Crimea was the dumbest thing Putin has ever done. It gave the West a reason to put the classic economic stranglehold on them. Putin was also too stupid and lacked the foresight to see US fracking disrupting the oil market, which with the invasion gave the Saudis two reasons to really fuck with the oil prices. 




 I'd say it would be worth the risk if it drops to ~1% of its previous value. Right now even if it recovers you wouldn't make that much of a return for it to be worth the risk. 




 This doesn't quite work if one side has disproportionate power. 




 90% of what? Relative to what? Lifetime? Age? 




 You don't need unemployment to be 20-30% for the problem to get really bad. The labor participation rate is the lowest in decades, mainly due to the elderly leaving the workforce early. These people will have limited savings and SS will be strained to its limits. Politicians love to talk about SS's solvency, but the fact of the matter is that if you have (1) a consumption-based economy and (2) a huge and aging part of the population unable to afford things, you have no choice but to be aggressive as you can to pour money in. In the future, UBI could basically be a massive expansion of SS. 




 That... is really dangerous. Your lab can get investigated or penalized for that bullshit. 




 Im overly paranoid: I take off my gloves every 30 minutes or when I'm switching tasks. 




 Caps to the right -- they won't snap off in that orientation. 




 A lot of Chinese eat it at home, so they won't be seen eating it by anyone in the public. In my case, I've only had it around my parents. 




 There's one for stomach organoids recently in Nature as well. 




 Seriously though, looking forward to some epic space battles. DS9 had some great scenes with the Defiant fucking shit up. 




 It's politically convenient for Democrats to do it now, since the map is structured so that they aren't dependent on the Florida vote. Also, that state has become way more diverse in recent decades so the Cuba voting bloc isn't as strong. 




 He did give the order, though. It's likely that Dar Adal doesn't give a fuck about Saul or Lockhart. 




 At this rate Schwarzenegger has more political experience than Colbert. 




 Propping up the currency is useless if you freeze up capital flow and consequently stop the economy. Modern economies rely on credit, so if you suddenly increase to 7.5% you will literally be putting many companies out of business overnight. Not to mention that consumption drives economies, and high interest rates encourage saving. 




 You need money to fight wars. How long can Russia last? 




 Don't banks usually raise it a percent or two at a time? How does a 7.5% interest rate increase not collapse the economy, excluding the effect of oil prices? 




 Having your bargaining chip be your lifeblood is definitely a stupid business plan. The other issue is that with how geopolitical games are playing out with Ukraine, nobody can trust Russia or its government supported companies to negotiate in good faith. At least in China where they have an even higher penetrance of government-sponsored corporations, money rather than politics is the bottom line.
