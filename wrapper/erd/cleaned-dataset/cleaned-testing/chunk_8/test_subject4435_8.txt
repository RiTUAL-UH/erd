 I'll check it out but when I looked at the AL Finder map there were only 6 people in my area. :( 




 Wherever that is, I need to go there. This community sucks. 




 IT'S SO SMALL. There's like 25 of us here and like 85% are exes and then another 10% is friends with one or the other half of the exes, and then the other 5% is apparently invisible. 




 Not here! That's why I'm asking about other people's communities! Here anyone you think might be butch is gender queer or trans. Which is TOTALLY fine. But butch women seem to be curiously absent! Leading me to wonder if it's just here, or if it's everywhere! 




 Pardon?
I guess the simplest explanation is:
Women who dress in a masculine fashion, and don't feel a need to identify as anything except women who dress in a masculine fashion. 




 It's... Well it's a difficult explanation really. Because it's one of those silly sub-types of labels. BUT. To me it's truly butch, not androgynous. Not trans. Manners, cockiness, knowing how to treat a lady. I fully expect to catch heat for this but it's women who enjoy being women but also dress like men and don't feel the need to be anything BUT a woman who dresses masculine. 

That was the worst explanation ever. I'm sorry. 




 Hey all!
I have a question!
Do "old school butch" women still exist? Where I live (Atlantic Canada) it seems like "true butch" just got totally obliterated before I was even a baby gay.
What are your communities like? Does "old school butch" mean anything to you? All opinions welcome! Show me what you know! :) 




 What is ftfy? 




 Court can call it whatever they want, but it's still rape.  




 Lol. Read a book. 




 Also I'd like to add that spontaneity is a factor, as well as potential intoxication. Those things, being drunk, high swept up in a moment, they can cloud your judgement. You may realize once you're in a situation that you're not comfortable. You should then be able to say that no, you're not comfortable, and that the situation needs to end. 

If we equate what you've said to a different crime perhaps you will see where you went wrong. On a first date, should I inform the person that I'm having tea with that I wouldn't be comfortable being murdered in any way, and that abduction is not something I'm into?  




 What's unrealistic is to state your sexual boundaries before you've even spent time with a person and gauged sexual chemistry and interest. I shouldn't have to start every first date with "I need to have protected sex." Because clearly I'm not going to have sex with all of those people. No does actually mean no, even though that phrase has been used to much it has almost no meaning now. I should be able to decide at any point during a sexual encounter that what's happening is not okay with me, and have that encounter end or change pace. I shouldn't be forced to complete an act I'm not comfortable with simply because I did not state when I met this person, that I was uncomfortable with something. 




 I probably wouldn't physically push anyone. Girls like that... they won't necessarily let it stop at that and the next thing you're in jail for "beating her up." 




 Please do!  




 I knew there was logic behind my irrational fear of amusement parks. 




 Everyone should have a Mrs. Ara.

 Is your dog okay?  




 I seriously would not let her out of my sight. Nothing has ever happened to my girl but in the city I live in, bad things happen to small dogs A LOT. She goes out on a leash AND we have a fence with a gate that makes a ton of noise. Call me paranoid if you want.
Do you have any enemies you can think of, OP? Do your parents? 




 I'm sorry the comments section is full of a bunch of jokes. Not sure what happened there. What did it feel like, grabbing your hand? Another hand? Smooth? Scales? Etc. Did you guys find somewhere else to sleep? What did your husband have to say? 




 Holy shit dude. It already happened once? Talk to your parents again, see if you can get someone to watch her during the day. I dog sit, but I'm betting you're too far away for me to help you. 




 He's a dickhole!! Or an assdick. 




 It got removed cause it was too short. Maybe add it here instead? 
I hope your pup is okay. I know I would go pretty batty if anyone tried to hurt my girl. 




 I know right? Nothing since the nose bleed except more heartburn but seriously waking up and reading this scared the bejesus out out of me. 




 Smash it. Burn the pieces. Mix whatever's left and all the ashes with a whole bunch of salt, put it all in a jar, and leave it in a church. 




 Any thoughts on what she was/is? Your description made me think Fae, dark Fae clearly. Let us know if you've got any information on her! 




 They're Fae. And you've pissed them off. Leave small bowls of offerings, honey, milk, sweets, etc, near the circle. While you're there tell them who you are, why you're there, and apologize for disturbing them. Tell them you mean them no harm. And keep us updated!
Edit: My family always said to ward off Fae you should carry a piece of iron on you and place it above your doorways as well. We use horseshoes above the doors. The Fae can't stand iron. Nor can they stand salt so putting a line of salt at your exterior doorways should keep you safe when you're indoors. 




 Deathly heartburn and random nausea last night, bloody nose this morning. Well fuck. Am I gonna die? 




 Fucking furbies. I "accidentally" left mine behind when we moved house a few years ago. Hope whoever moved in had a great time with the little bastard. 




 That's basically why I don't pick up in bars. Ya never know what you're taking home. 




 I love bikers. Y'all are so tough but if a toddler hands you a plastic phone you're damn sure gonna answer it. I hope those of you left make it out alright. Keep us updated. 




 It's gone anyway but disbelief doesn't belong here. Everything is true on Nosleep.

 But people are just so much more terrible... and they inspire so much more grief.  




 You're a fucking lunatic. If your idea of fun is killing an animal, I hope someone gets the same joy out of killing you. Kill people. They are inherently bad and they deserve it. Animals have done nothing wrong. 




 Welcome, friend. It happens to the best of us. 




 Honey I think you might have died. Maybe you're in someone else's body, maybe you're not. But you need to do some research. Google the car accident. See if you died. If you look hard enough you should be able to find death certificates. Maybe listen to the guy on the phone, too. 




 So many babies here. So many.  




 You're not supposed to break character. That's the whole point of the sub. Everything here is true. 




 That isn't how things work here. 




 Maybe just stop killing her... Tell someone when you see her. A doctor or a police officer. Anyone who knows what happened in the past. 




 Okay so. I'm sorry for what happened but this may be the wrong Sub... 




 Tell us what happened next! Did you confront your parents? What happened to Margaret?! 




 Salt!! In all the doorways and in a circle around your bed. Also, lazy arse, start shoveling. I've been shorter than the snow banks for weeks here and haven't put the shovel down yet. If you're still alive, give us an update! 




 First of all, the part where her blood was green was actually a story she had told from a previous time. Not actually a part of the events of OP's account. Secondly, it takes an extraordinarily large and long-term addiction to the drugs to produce the green blood reaction. For example, mixing heroin and oxycontin for an extended period will sometimes produce it. However, everyone's body chemistry is different and not everyone will have the same reaction. AND you just broke the rules of this sub. No disbelief. 




 Really? 




 Thanks. I've started doing that too. Not eating when I know I'll be out all day. Quitting smoking made it so unbearable that I didn't leave my house for 2 weeks and basically just decided to keep smoking so I could walk my dog without incident. I haven't sorted out what triggers it yet, I seem to just be on a 3 day rotation of can't stop/can't go. Maybe I'll give the walk in clinic a shout and see what they can do for me! Thanks! 




 That would just be magical. No more gallbladder = spanking new case of ibs. Still haven't mastered that whole being far away from a toilet thing yet. I would literally try anything to help. Even some of the questionable Nosleep style remedies. 




 Both I guess but mostly your sister.
