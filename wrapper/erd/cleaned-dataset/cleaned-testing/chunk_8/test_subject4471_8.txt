 Since when did Jupiter have a blue atmosphere? 




 These threads are a welcome break from the "DAE Roman Reigns is bad for main event?" 




 hafr jlus bjrnsson (the mountain actor) would be a sight to see in the ring 




 To add to this anecdote, I used to work in telecomm, working on hydro (power in Canada) lines for the local power companies. While my own company is fairly small and was all guys, the power company was this monolithic public corporation, yet some of the supers were explaining to me they were having a hard time hiring anyone because (a) half of the population (women) never apply for anything but office jobs and (b) graduating college kids with engineering degrees don't want to work in some middle-of-nowhere city. 

These jobs pay a metric fuck ton with amazing benefits AND union support. You practically have an amazing job for life, yet no one wants to work on substations in Farmville Canada. 




 The most UW has is the Chinese Student Society and a couple other clubs, but the campus is socially dead. 




 Now keep this between you and me, smashed hat. 




 Noooo, Screamville. 




 *That's the joke* 




 *Parole granted.* 




 Fox turned into a hardcore sex channel so gradually, I didn't even notice...yeesh. 




 It's just a stupid rock. But do you see any tigers around here? 




 A boat's a boat, but the box could be anything...it could even be a boat! You know how much we've wanted one of those. 




 Big Rigs: Off the Road Racing would like a word with you 




 I managed to get it to work doing this a couple hours ago, though I appreciate you giving help. 




 Which VPN? Hola never works for me anymore 




 Too late! 




 Look who the new pet is! 




 Watch out, radioactive man! 




 City simulators, various single-player space games, EVE Online to an extent 




 Aw man, this is depressing.

I know what would cheer us up...bowling! 




 YES! Take that, Bitterman 




 All right, well I suppose it's time for your bribe. You can have the washer and dryer where the lovely Smithers is standing, or *what's in this box.* 




 I can barely read this 




 GW2. FFXIV has a better end-game for its PvE raids, but that's about it 




 GW2 




 A temp 




 Actually, most polls and studies I have seen show most gamers being in their late-20s to mid-30s, not teenagers. 




 If you just want to level fast, get on an eye of the mist "karma train." I leveled two characters to 80 from 20 with birthday boosts. /age on each is 22 hours. My first 80 normal quest leveling took months. 




 [Same character then starts drinking again in season 3.](/nsfw) 




 I have 600 hours in this game; second most played aftet WoW in my entire library. If anyone has questions just ask me 




 THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE 




 Hey I know Kimmo, the artist. We did some work together; got him on my LinkedIn as well 




 I had a massive spreadsheet I used for planetary interaction...but that is hardcore industrial stuff most players never touch on the scale I was doing it at. :p 




 But why would you ever pay for an alpha, especially for a game ALREADY COMPLETED. It's not like Trion is some indie company either; did they charge for the fucking Rift beta? Defiance? No. 




 Never pay for a beta. I thought all you people learned from fucking archeage.... 




 Everything clashes with everything. The hair, the armor dyes are all mixed, the ridiculous final fantasy legendary sword, the sunglasses and even the back piece. :p 




 I'd rather spend the money on whopper wednesday 




 GW1 just gave an error message. All of what you said can be solved with basic "if" statements; if inventoryfull=true then show error message and do not change the build.

It's a basic UI feature that should have been in game since launch 




 "Interested" is PR bull for "not anytime soon." How fucking complicated can it be to implement a basic build save/swap system? Instead we get hang gliding and black angel wings.... 




  Not gonna lie... it totally works.

By getting you killed? 









 at least the wings in Aion served a purpose... 




 Gretchen  Elliott had far more impact on Walt than any other character in the show, except for maybe Jesse. Gretchen was Walt's ex-girlfriend and Elliott was his best friend in grad school, the man with whom he founded Grey Matter.

As we see in the show, Walt wants to earn everything himself - when Gretchen's rich family helps startup Grey Matter (presumably, but never explicitly mentioned), Walt becomes infuriated and leaves her. In his chaotic and moody state after leaving the love of his life, Walt gets hitched to some random diner waitress named Skyler, gets her pregnant almost immediately and then goes and buys some boring suburban house like everyone else. Walter then watches for 16 years while his ex-girlfriend marries his best friend, takes Walter's research and uses it with Gretchen's money to forge a billion-dollar pharma company that should have belonged to Walter. 




 Smells like a quick rewrite over some contract dispute or accident off-set 




 Breaking Bad was also a cable show - they were limited by how much they could swear (I believe it is 1-2 per season). Not giving House of Cards an excuse, but rather it makes the Breaking Bad writers work harder as they need to make their few swears have that much more impact. 




 Well the writers are clearly inspired by Macbeth and Richard III, two of Shakespeare's plays. In Richard III, Richard monologues quite a bit with the audience in the first act, but as the play goes on, he does this less and less to make him less sympathetic to the audience. By the end of the play, he does not monologue and the audience can see how monstrous he has become. 




 YO PRESDENT.

BITCH 




 I'd rather they end on a high note then drag the show along for more money. 




 Need to stretch out the show so Netflix and Kevin Spacey get more money.

I felt Doug should have ended Rachel in episode 3-4 and the whole Dunbar Iowa crap ends around episode 7-8. 




 gtfo this thread idiot 




 But they're not free. You're paying $40 a year. That $40 could have bought me the games on sale on Steam for my PC. 




 That's a really stupid analogy. I don't pay a monthly fee to use Steam and therefore don't get any "free" games that normally cost money. 




 Not really "free" though, is it? Still have to buy Gold 




 That's not a very good thing at all. 




 *You're all going to die.* 




 They can't laugh. They're in too much fear of the guards jabbing them with bayonets. 




 If I was a modeller or artist who made The Order, id be pretty damn proud. The art was apparently the best thing about the game. Good stuff for a portfolio too 




 Call her to make date arrangements. When someone says (with their voice) they will do something, there is less of a chance they will flake. Works at work and dating. 




 Frankly I did not read your post. Wayyyyy too long

If you want a number, ask for it. There no fucking magic trick. "Hey, what is your number?" Done. Don't need to write a fucking novel dude. 




 Like this crystal meth. 




 Don't know why... the market sucks right now. Good luck selling an 890 or reclaimer for anything above the CIG price. 




 Mm...no. people are just buying cool looking ships at this point. 




 *polite clapping* 




 Being a trade mogul and running a large corp, same as EVE 




 Better Call Lionel 




 looks like something is wrong with the specular maps 




 "OMG guys look, The Repopulation."

"OMG guys look, Star Citizen."

"OMG guys look, Blade and Soul."

"OMG guys look, Everquest Next."

"OMG guys look, ArcheAge."

"OMG guys look, Albion Online."

"OMG guys look, Black Desert."

"OMG guys look, Crowfall." 




 WoW stomps on all of them, the closest I can think of are GW2 and FFXIV. A different kind of game, but DC Universe is also fairly polished. 




 Have you played Machinarium? It's a puzzle/adventure game set in a similar setting; steampunk with robots and fairly post-apocalyptic.  




 No more fantasy, no more elves. I want to see more contemporary or realistic sci-fi MMORPGs. Someone mentioned TRON, which would make for an awesome MMO setting. You mentioned Cowboy Bebop, which would be very cool. 




  "fuck this drama"

That was really stupid...now you sound even more passive-aggressive.

As for third dates - somewhere romantic where it's not just sitting in a dark theater 




 Boy, that would be sweet. 




 Before you learn to kiss a girl, you need to learn to KISS. Keep it simple, stupid. This post is way too long.

Go outside and talk to people. There's no magic trick to it; the more opportunities you give yourself to be around women, the law of averages dictates that one of them must eventually like you enough to kiss you. 




 My eventual goal is marriage and a family with a future best friend.

The red pill is about misogyny and hatred. The dudes there are the extreme version of neckbeard rejects who have never gotten laid - they take their frustrations out on women, instead of realizing they are all a bunch of miserable losers with no confidence nor effort to improve themselves. 




 Wildstar still has the best IMO, but the rest of the game is under-populated and buggy. 




 Oh, Ice Creamville! 




 I thought they lived in New Horror Field? 




 "Hey, I really like speaking with you but I have to go; give me your number so we can keep this going."

Or you can do the more bold thing and straight ask her out: "Sorry, I have to go but I want to continue our talk over a drink sometime, maybe next week. Write your number down."

Never ask them for their numbers. Always tell them you want their number, then hand them your phone. I get rejected far less when my phone is already out and it's staring the girl in the face.

Never be scared of rejection. It happens to everyone. Shrug it off and move on. 




 To become more intimate with the person in a conversation, just ask them intimate, personal questions. Say you start talking about a vacation they were just on; next, ask them "That sounds awesome! What would be your dream vacation?" 




 You didn't ask for a date or anything - you're just making lame jokes for what end purpose? You need to be direct with women and stop beating around the bush. They will respect you for that and it will help outside of dating as well (e.g. in the work place).

As for your picture in the OP, I could say maybe get a haircut or something, but looks are nowhere as important to women as personality and self-confidence. But definitely lose the shag - I can see you with short sides and a bit of styling up top. 




 no, move on 




 I don't think physical demons exist like we see them in comic books or Diablo 3, but are manifestations of bad ideas, thoughts, habits and activities. Like when someone did something bad they feel like they're "living with demons," when in fact it's just a sense of regret and foreboding.

When someone passes blame to a sort of intelligent evil mastermind behind everything bad, it does a discredit toward's humanity's own craftiness and tendency towards violence. Furthermore, why would God just let these little red-eyed devils run amok among his people if they have no redemption available to them? 




 May have better luck asking on /r/OrthodoxChristianity

Use the search bar there, lots of times this question has been answered 




 Do you seriously believe that? lol not sure if troll. 




 OP, everybody 

 wouldn't really mind having my boys hear their mom moaning for me from another room. 




 Ask her what food she likes. Cooking can be fun and easy - she can help you make it, or just let her sit while you do all the work, but keep the mood light and flirty. 




 He just said he was going to cook for her. They're not going winter hiking -.- 




 Did you buy the tickets already? 




 Get rid of the movie dude. Johanna is right - you want to have as much physical and social (conversation) interaction as possible on a first date to get to know the person and establish some physical contact face-to-face.  




 No, its shit. The shepard looks all deformed and you can clearly see they ripped the Charon from EVE in the bottom right. 




 The movie was not as good as the book - no movie I've seen has ever been as good as their book - but it still was a good movie. 




 The baby scene 




 amazing 




 Here's a trick: text them back while they're standing with you, using the excuse, "Here, let me send you my # too."

 So do I attempt to call her again?

No. 




 Something lighthearted and in public, considering it is a first date. Go take her to get coffee or hot cocoa, then walk around a park, go skating or something. 

NEVER go to the cinema on a first date. It's dark. You can't talk to them. It's really awkward and shit. Cinema dates are better later on - great for making out in the back. 




  "Be selfish"

I really don't like this, but that's the Anglican in me speaking.. You can be confident, charming and intelligent without having to resort to being a selfish prick.

The first paragraph was good advice though. OP needs to stop complaining and actually put in the time if he wants some results. 




 Plenty more numbers out there man - grats on getting one girl's number (well, almost). Chin up, take it as a victory. 




 ^^no 




 how i accounting? 




 Why not? 




 I don't think we're the right people to answer your questions - all we can give is amateur conjecture. I would strongly suggest seeing a sex and/or relationship therapist. 




 It's this weekend. 




 Um, it's free. 




 "move it chowdahead."
