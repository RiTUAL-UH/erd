 Surprised to see Stone and Echo has never been opened.  









 Hahaha 









 I think he just used the one for the photo op.  




 I saw "bacon fest", stopped reading and clicked the link hoping to find the details to a bacon festival where people eat bacon. Do they at least serve bacon during the discussions? 




 Yeah he is a very talented human being. 














 See? Zach knows what the fuck is up.

EDIT: Words. Was drunk. 




 Aaaaaaand that's how my story should have ended. Respectively. 




 Super funny when you look back at it. As soon as I saw this post, that random moment in my high school history revealed itself. It was like winning the memory lottery. 




 No dice. This guy was "Screech". 




 What was the singers name? 




 Holy shit. I totally forgot about this. Awesome. 




 This reminds me of a talent show my friends entered as a band back in high school. Of course the school wanted to review what each group would perform, so once they read the lyrics to "killing in the name of", they told the singer of the band he had to change "fuck you, I won't do what you tell me" or don't play it at all. Fast forward to the performance, he actually had the vagina to scream "screw you, I won't do what you tell me."

I feel he totally missed the point of the song.

EDIT: Words 




 Thanks, I'll give this a shot. 




 I'd love to have my library sorted by artist (alphabetically), album (year of release), with every track in the correct order. That's how I have my actual music folder sorted. Is there a code that can correct this, given every file has adequate tag information?  




 I've recently switched from iTunes to foobar200. I love the interface and the customizability so far.

I am having an issue with organizing my library. Turns out some albums in my music folder do not have the track number in the file name, but only in the tag. As such, those albums are now organized alphabetically in my foobar library. I have done some research, and have found I should sort by "%album% %tracknumber%" with no luck.

I'd really like to avoid having to update any album that doesn't have the track number in the song file names. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry if this is redundant or the wrong sub, first post here.

I still buy CDs, and this software is the best I've come across. I'm sure one could acquire it for free, but I support them because it's so great. Not only rips CDs in FLAC/320, but fills out all identification tags and adds album artwork. 




 1994 - X-Files themed chat room. I was known as "Iceman". 









 Ok that's good news then. Playing those levels are my better memories of 1999. 




 I'm playing through Black Mesa for the first time and heard there are no Xen levels? Is this true? I'd be super disappointed if that were the case. 




 All good, thanks again. 




 Thanks for that. How about the quality of the gear? 




 Is this a good buy?

 Holy moly, this post blew up. Thanks for the front page! 









 Great tune, and leads wonderfully into Right In Two. I've always loved this song in particular and hope Tool revisit this type of sound again. 




 /r/pawg 









 It doesn't have that grinding noise I love so very much, as it pours throughout the surround sound in my man cave. 




 I might be alone in this, but I really dislike how the BR sounds and looks as well. 




 Is it bad I'm married with kids? 




 I can see the new marketing scheme now, "Chef Boyardee, it fills voids!" 




 Black then white are all I see in my infancy, red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me. Lets me see.


As below, so above and beyond, I imagine drawn beyond the lines of reason. Push the envelope. Watch it bend. 




 I agree. However, I'd love to see how they make that beef product.  




 The sound of the spoon scraping the side of the ribbed can really adds to the effect I find.

EDIT: Spelling. 









 Kworalllll 




 Haha! As buggy as the thing is I have been enjoying myself.  




 Fun fact: the heads on spikes scene can be attributed to [Adam Jones](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Jones_%28musician%29), the guitar player for Tool. He's awesome at all things creepy. 




 I'm with you. Loves me some heavies, if you know what I'm sayin'. 




 Yeah this seems to make the most sense. 




 Yeah I can totally see that being the issue. 




 Oh yeah, totally forgot about the heavy version. 




 I too enjoy the lack of snipers on this map, but thought it was odd all the same. Maybe it has to do with the camping spaces, like on top of or around the satellites. 




 Something I've always wondered.

EDIT: Pertinent halo related discussion instantly downvoted without reason. Cool. 




 Who would do such a thing? 




 Interesting. Thanks for that. 




 I used to have a copy of that book with the same cover, I can't find it anywhere.  




 I think we can Allah Gree with that. 









 I'm here man, what do you want to chat about? 




 It's the health epidemic that's sweeping the nation. If you and your product cannot be synonymous with healthy active living, it will fail in today's market. 

I'm not saying there's anything at all wrong with healthy living, but I can't help but feel it's forced down my throat every day, and this picture is a perfect example of it.

Every time I eat a cheeseburger or have a cigarette I can't help but feel overwhelmingly guilty, it really sucks.

TL;DR Boo hoo poor me. 




 [We get them around my work all the time](http://i.imgur.com/heUJqvo.jpg) 




 I'm not sure they have a website, it's really just a butcher on a farm North of the city. They offer just about anything you can think of. They have all sorts of game meat (elk, bison, deer etc), and of course chicken, pig, and beef. A big juicy New York Striploin is about 10 dollars, and personally for me, the best thing I've ever eaten. 

I stock up on all my meats there, hamburger, whole chickens, bone-in hams, steaks, bacon, and sausages to name a few. It's worth seeking out and having a look for yourself.

(FYI - you have to call in and pre-order bone-in hams this time of year)

 




 I highly recommend "Balzac Meats". The quality of everything they have is amazing. 




 I am not familiar with the band, but these pictures are the epitome of bandporn IMO. Good work. 




 Nice, thanks man! 




 She likes beans and Guinness now.

 Oh dear god.... 




 Simplistically beautiful. 




 We're throwing a seasonal going away party for a soon to be ex-coworker, so of course I'm looking to do something a little demeaning, but in good fun. Something fun we can laugh about. Thanks in advance for any and all help.

I'll be happy with whatever image you can come up with.


 




 Anyone have Palms wallpapers? Google is coming back with junk. Thanks mahfuckahs. 




 The sign on the door annoyed me.

[http://i.imgur.com/cTEyKDr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cTEyKDr.jpg) 




 One of my all time favourites. 




 Let me know if you ever think about selling it. 




 A copy of Radiohead's "Kid A". 




 I've been materialistically yearning for this thing for so many years. Let me know if you're willing to part with it for a price. Most eBay copies are damaged and I can't bring myself to get one. 




 [Se7en.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114369/?mode=desktop) 




 Haha awesome, thanks! This is perfect. 




 [Imagine studio versions of the live stinkfist, third eye, and schism extensions?](http://i.imgur.com/Q8BvuIJ.gif) 




 That about sums up my halo 1   2 match making experience so far. Either I'm incredibly bad, or I'm very very terrible.

 On that note, I find intension doesn't get enough love. It's great.

 I am totally ordering it.  




 V2 is my favourite. I love that movie, thanks for posting. 




 "Hey here's an amazing idea, would you like to buy it?"

"Holy fuck that's amazing, I would buy that in a heart beat"

"Ok we'll release it in like, 6 months"

"Alright 6 months has passed here you go!"

"This is nowhere near what you described 6 months ago."

"Oh yeah, well about that, we totally shouldn't have promised 6 months, more like 8. Sooooo sorry."

"As a consumer I should be outright pissed off and demand my money back. But because this is the current state of the world and it's lack of quality assurance, I'm totally ok with it." 




 Classic misunderstanding. All is good. 




 Buddy is hard as a bag of frozen rabbits. 




 Good stuff! 




 I would highly recommend "GoSkyWatch", interactively learning about the universe around you is fun at any age. It's totally worth the few bucks it costs.

EDIT: [GoSkyWatch Planetarium - the astronomy star guide by GoSoftWorks](https://appsto.re/ca/mzh_q.i) 




 I agree, this scene actually made me laugh out loud, I thought it was gold. 









 Not once did I claim to be the originator of the photo. If I did, I probably would have said, "this old picture I had taken". I most certainly did find it on a hard drive though, in a folder of a bunch of other stuff I made/saved from the Internet. 

Thanks detective, your work here is done. 




 God Frankie is so awesome. I love how generally concerned he is for his fellow countrymen.  




 Mine will always be The Exorcist. I will never forget the feeling of utter dread it instilled in me when I was about 10 years old and seeing it for the first time. I've been hooked on horror ever since.

After that I would say (in no particular order):

The Shining

Exorcist III

Martyrs

Jacob's Ladder

Silence Of The Lambs
 




 [Well that's underwhelming](http://i.imgur.com/42kdLIq.png) 









 Haha, funny. 




 Willow park is great hey? 




 I am not a musician myself, but I understand where you're coming from. I do own a couple of guitars, and I do strum them like an idiot from time to time, but I know talent when I hear it, or so I like to believe. Then again, music really hits me emotionally, and if I can find solace in a piece of music, then I consider it good. 




 Lurker here, Laphroaig QC is only $40.00 here in Alberta. 




 Yeah no doubt. 




 I think you'd have to be straight edge to pull off that level of virtuosity. 




 Good, I thought it was the Ebola virus. 




 At the end of the day this sounds like the best solution. 




 I named this guy too, "Hairy Satan". 




 I think it's best we try and establish communication. Perhaps we can find a mutual agreement. 




 Dude. Best idea yet. 




 Especially if you offer them a beer. 




 I was thinking about how cool it would be if they were the size of wolves and lived in our forests. 




 I'm glad to hear this actually. Was wondering if its bite would cause necrosis or some other god awful ailment. I will leave it be. 




 Definitely the right species. Guy over in /r/whatsthisbug said it was a cats head orb weaver. 




 I invited it in for a beer but it hissed at me. 




 That's totally it, thanks a million! 









 Hey thanks! I'll give it a shot. 




 I was considering this. I need to know what it is first. It's still out there staring at me through the window. 









 Ouch. 




  Have you ever seen a police officer stop people downtown for running lights or blocking traffic? Not once in 15 years and I see it several times a day.

I agree, that is exactly what you said.

 




 So what do you do for a living? Monitor and observe police downtown 24/7? 

As Oderdigg has  never seen a cop give out a ticket, it therefore has never happened. 




 I grew up with an 11/11 (Remembrance Day in Canada) as my birthday. My parents always had parties for me, despite being from a family with a lot of military history. As long as you try you'll be ok. 




 Haha! 




 Mildly interesting as fuck right there. 




 Why? 




 Opposite side of the futon. 




 Thank you! 




 Haha nope, just pretending to be Neo on mIRC. 




 Bought from the parallax shows last year, 10 bucks a piece.
