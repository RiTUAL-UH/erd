 No, I don't really feel a romantic connection with men.  

I've met a few guys I've been physically attracted to but their personalities totally turned me off so it was a no go. I can't really explain it. I'm attracted to the fantasy of a man but not irl men. I find that guys fall short of the fantasy. 




 I was raised Roman Catholic and couldn't imagine leaving the Church behind or renouncing my faith. I'm more Catholic in tradition than practice (but still attend Church occasionally, etc.). My family are just Catholic, that's just the way it is. I've reconciled my faith with my sexuality over time. When I was a teenager I believed it to be a sin. Now, I just believe Mark 12:30-31; I believe in loving God with all my heart, and loving my neighbours as I love myself. And oddly enough, I think of the Miranda Lambert song "Heart Like Mine"  where she sings: Jesus, "He would understand a heart like mine". I think if I try to be a good person, go to Church, be charitable, and kind to others, than that's all that really matters. In the end, Jesus will be my judge, not man. 




 I identify as bisexual, but only consider dating women. I'm sexually attracted to men but that's about it. I have yet to find a guy in real life that I'm attracted to, the more I get to know a guy the more I lose interest, meanwhile women are just so attractive in every way. 




 What bothers me is that they have to explain it at all. From the viewers POV, everything was working in the favour of the allies. If they hinted that it was going to be a hell of a fight with tons of casualties, it would work but they spent the last episode having Cage in a sort of rage because they, the MM, aren't left with any viable defences. 




 Yep, same here, with one added 'tell' which is my voice for some reason goes deeper. 




 Emmylou Harris - Boulder to Birmingham 




 Yes! It would be nice to be asked. I asked a friend to take down drunken pics of me from his facebook. He did but then months later put them back up. I approve things added to my timeline now. 




 Yes, Kate Winslet. Titanic. 




 My golden does this sometimes. Usually when we're out for walks and she wants to play with stray dogs and I won't let her. 




 For slowed down music, I've always liked Don Williams. Emmylou Harris is also good. 




 Jenny is my favourite L Word character. 




 Now I'm confused, I thought TDEE took into account activities like exercise? 




 I'll see how it goes for this week. I played my first soccer game yesterday and it was pretty intense so I'm really tired and sore. If 1540 calories isn't enough I'll add 100 calories incrementally until I feel the difference. 




 I'll try it for a week then and see how it goes. Thanks. 




 I'm 26, 5'5", 132lbs. I started lifting and running three weeks ago. I lift and run 3x a week and play soccer once a week for an hour. I'm wondering if 1520 calories is enough? My TDEE is 1902 and I took 20% off of that. Should I be eating more calories? I want to lose weight but gain muscle.

I try to eat 105g of protein, 60g of fat, and 140g of carbs. I always fall a little short on protein and fat and overdoing carbs but everyday I'm getting better the more I experiment with food. 




 Dixie Chicks Top of the World CD and 20 best of 60s Rock and Roll CD. I was 14 and decided I would find music that I really liked and stopped listening and buying whatever MTV or pop radio told me to listen and buy. The 60s CD was my parents but I loved it, "Da Doo Ron Ron" "Ain't No Mountain High" "Wild Thing". 




 I love running. I used to run track and field in Grade 5 and I remember looking at a poster of Donovan Bailey wishing I could be as fast as him. I played soccer as well in elementary and later ran track in high school. But I think it does grow on you but you shouldn't be afraid to try other things. My mom started cycling after being a runner for years and absolutely loves it because it's much faster, and less harsher on her knees. 




 I bought a digital textbook. Was slightly less expensive and it expired at the end of the semester. I could bookmark pages so I could flip back and forth very easily. The only thing was that it was available through a website I had to login and the website sucked and was a little slow and I could only download one chapter at a time. 




 I actually like Blake Shelton's music because I feel it's genuine to who he is. As for Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean, I believe they're sell outs because I really don't think their music is genuine to who they are. 




 Ashley Monroe, Elizabeth Cook, Kelsey Waldon, Sunny Sweeney, Angaleena Presley, Nikki Lane, Lydia Loveless, Holly Williams, Lee Ann Womack. Thought I'd add more women to your list. 




 Xena. Buffy. Spice Girls. Hermione Granger. Captain Janeway. Sandra Bullock in Miss Congeniality. Aurora from Sleeping Beauty. Stupid Ash from Pokemon couldn't appreciate Misty. Also, my brother and I used to have lightsaber fights in the backyard. And how could I forget Lucy Liu in Charlie's Angels, leather and whip.
