 The outtakes were not pretty.  




 That's the first one we did in that sort of style but you might like what we did with the MT-09:  https://youtu.be/f1i9Ww27lxU 




 I'm just shit at kick starting. A mate who grew up on dirt bikes got it going in 7 or 8 tries.  




 Absolutely. It's easy to ride and pleasant to get about on. You're not getting Yamaha reliability - but on the other hand if you don't mind getting the spanners out now and then to do minor tighten ups and check things over, it'll teach you more about maintaining your own machine than you'll learn on a Yamaha.  




 I can tell you on our test bike the exhaust shield bolts came undone on day 2. But pop a bit of loctite on and you should be right. It's the classic bike experience.  




 GET OUT 




 Yeah he was a surprise - I just wanted somebody to walk down the street playing trombone, I had no idea he could impersonate a motorcycle! Right guy to call! 




 Damn, great find! Thanks for that. That's a pretty compelling graph. 




 Haha sorry mate, we got a bit twisted with this.  




 I left a shot out where I tasted the himalayan pink salt and said 'mmmm, that's good salt.' 




 We were trying to keep things a touch ambiguous. Personally I can hardly watch it. I'm loving the YouTube comments. Haha!  




 It depends what you ride for. For me it's the thrill, and a naked makes fast feel a lot faster. I like having to hold on when the pace comes up, it's much more involving than sitting behind a fairing. More reward for less risk.  




 You don't spend much time on Web forums, do ya?  




 Looks a lot like the Zero S from some angles. 




 Look to the superteam of the East. There's your villain. 




 Last year was magnificent. Total humiliation.  




 I hate the cavs with my whole shriveled, black little heart.  




 This might be the year they finally grow up and do what everyone believes they can if they play the ball and forget the refs. 




 I used it just this week. It's there! Make sure you haven't clicked on a category that's restricting your search. Click on Video in effects and search for letterbox.  




 I dunno mate, check my history, I'm not a bullshitter.  




 The one dunk I ever got in a game. It was a D-grade women's game and I was reffing. All alone on a fast break, this lady puts up a layup, and I can see the instant it leaves her hand exactly what's about to happen. It's going to sit pretty right in front of the rim.

I was obsessed with dunking. At 5"11 and white, this was not a healthy obsession. I used to jump off things to make it happen. I could jump straight up and hang on the rim with both hands, but was an inch or two short of being able to throw it down. It just burned me inside, I used to dream about dunking at night.

So when I saw that ball, something snapped inside me. I was already at full sprint, but I changed course to head for the basket instead of the baseline... One, two, launch... I caught the ball with one hand and jammed the fuck out of it, and roared like a mountain lion.

Then I had to blow the whistle and give somebody a sideball as they all looked at me in total shock. And to make things worse, one of their kids on the sideline started crying and saying "NO JORDANS, NO JORDANS."

Doesn't matter; got dunk. I never got another dunk in a game but I can now die happy. 




 We'll see it in MCN as "LEAKED: could this be the new GSX-R?" 




 I've been helping out with promo in Australia, so i got to our local premiere. Great film, very funny. I never saw the first one but laughed my arse off at this one.  




 Fucken yay. 




 Jesus that guy's voice is just exquisite. It's the perfect instrument for pop.  




 Aaaaaaaaand no NBA for you Australia.  




 It's a bastard to get out of that stadium. 




 Unfortunately then you will have zucchini.  




 That guy is just ridiculous.  




 Another tip: I forgot to pay my rego and was pulled over for unregistered driving. Had to pay the rego by the side of the road before I could leave, but I got a 750 buck fine on top of it. 

Because it was within 2 weeks of the rego expiry, I was able to write in, say it was a mistake and get let off on a warning.  




 Not the worst way to spend a lunch hour. Definitely read the instructions, no matter how good you think you are - step 1 is "take the lid off the jar before you do anything else." 




 You sure you're infertile? I thought I was supposed to be after losing a nut and having chemo, but now I've got a son who disagrees with that assessment.  




 Took me about 5 years to be able to think clearly and sharply again, it felt like I was thinking through cotton wool. I found modafinil helpful.  




 I carry the gear I need for the job... If there's no job, the camera in my phone is good enough for snapshots. 




 Aw.  




 I like the way it rises like an empress above the Seeeerengetiiiiiii.  




 You and George Clooney.  




 Did he boop him on the wang there?  




 That's a great way to make sure next game the chants go "refs you suck dicks." 




 And the layups, and the open long twos. He's gonna be shattered.  




 That tech near the end - does he get that call if he hasn't been a whiny bitch all year? Huge call.  




 Dirigible.  




 I wonder what the stats are on gay dudes drawing dicks. Higher or lower rate of knobdoodling than straight guys?  




 STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM NOW WE... STILL HERE.  




 Or, YouTube could simply play vertical videos back in vertical orientation. 




 Actually it pretty much does. And ninja turtles.  




 I was against the idea of ABS until I tried it in the rain. It's beaut. And there are genuinely bikes out there now that are so fast that I find myself leaning on the ABS on fast roads. That's probably not a good thing, but the technology is astounding. Not to mention Bosch's cornering ABS system which takes it to the next level. 




 He's also shown he can be a huge douche, don't give your heart away so easily. 




 I suspect it'll be terrible. I know a company that's working on it - soundracer.com - and those guys have a fun thing that plugs into your car cigarette lighter. It reads the revs on your engine and then transmits the sound of a huge V8 to your car stereo so it feels like you're driving a monster truck. 

But it relies on revs - to do this for an electric vehicle, you'd need to simulate the presence of gear changes. It would ruin the effect. 




 I've ridden plenty of loud bikes, but I split every day on a bike that's as quiet as a mouse. I regularly sit and wait behind guys who plod along blipping their throttle waiting for assistance from car drivers to get through. The best thing you can do to make your bike better for splitting is to fit fold-in mirrors. 




 I like the sound of a bangwagon. Amish porn?  




 Yep. I'd put a giant-arsed family size pizza tray sprocket on the back and make it even more berserk if I owned it. I've got no business going more than 300kmh.  




 I've seen what they're working on for the next model and it will be right up your alley.  




 This is 100% down to battery cost. And there's some serious volume manufacturing staying to happen soon that is expected to bring the prove of batteries down by 75% - that's the target, at least.  




 I didn't get the prism til later. It's a GP10 Bluetooth backpack on the GoPro 3+ that receives the sound and sticks it on the GoPro vision.  




 Yeah I was traveling so I bought a lid in California, and I wanted something ADV style. But it wasn't too bad, even at speed!  




 The Gigafactory is all about cost reduction. But every battery company on the planet reckons they've got something with twice the energy density on the bench due to better structures or chemistry. Obama threw 6 billion dollars at the industry a few years back and there's just a constant stream of new ideas coming through. I have a lot of faith that major breakthroughs will change the game in the next 5-10 years. I'd love to see a graph of battery improvement since the 1990s, ni-cad through to Li-po and beyond, I suspect you'd be surprised.  




 Because people are still stressing about range on these things and going from direct drive to putting a gearbox in is at least a 10% drop in mechanical efficiency.  




 I have a strong recollection of one of the FAST BIKES guys pictured in a magazine pulling a huge stoppie on a GSXR K5, I think it was, without his fingers on the brake lever. This shot reminded me of that photo, and now I can't find the god damn picture. 




 Aprilia runs hot as a motherfucker. You'll need tin foil underpants if you "cruise" on it so you can get a nice crispy skin on your baked spuds. Good bike for going flat out on, but grumpy around town. My pick is the S1000RR, the 2015 model optioned up with the active suspension and cruise control. That's one hell of a bike. Super easy to putt about on, plus goes like stink on a full throttle, and having ridden a good few superbikes I'd say it's also been the comfiest for me. 




 Yep, brought a 20S with me to America and bought a helmet when I got there. Had the little GP10 GoPro backpack on. Sadly I fucked up the angle of the chest camera and I had precious little time to film, so that stuff was all but unuseable. The 20S does a pretty remarkable job considering I got up to about 130-140mph on some of those little squirts. 




 Here's the thing - massive, monstrous levels of performance are just not an issue. Range, battery density, fast charging standards and battery price are - and those will come down fast as the Gigafactory and other mass battery manufacturing operations kick into gear. All the things like emissions and noise regulations, and all the complicated reasons why petrol engines need more and more complex engineering to keep improving them - electrics don't have to worry about any of that stuff.  




 He's right - full throttle at a standstill doesn't take off like a rocket. It's an immensely powerful and torquey motor locked in a very high gear. I suspect most gas superbikes would beat it to 40mph. But hit the gas at 60mph, like I was on the Skyline road, and there's *nothing* I've ridden that comes close. It's absolutely insane. And if I owned one I'd downgear it as far as is practical, because I ain't gonna be doing 218mph any time soon and I'd want that monster performance as accessible as possible. 




 US$38k... Yeah. Still early adopter territory. 




 I don't think I'd have worked it out if he didn't put the tail piece next to it. 




 I had a Boss Hoss in my session on a track day once. Sat back and watched him lug that lardy barge around for a lap. It was a huge chore in the corners but he was clearly having a giggle smoking it up on the exits and the straights.

 Yeah, but you know how that stuff works. People who post that sort of shit are usually the ones who most need that message, that's why it resonates enough for them to want to post it. John Lennon's a great example - his lyrics were 'peace, love, mung beans' but he physically and mentally abused his wife. 




 I'm a father. I toss my son in the air heaps coz he loves it. Ok he's indifferent but I love it. Screw you guys.  




 No, but c'mon in buddy. Your bike is now an orphan again.  




 Fucking pricks. Just about every story or photo I post gets stolen and rehosted somewhere too. Even worse to see it submitted on reddit.  




 Melbourne is one of the best places in Australia to ride a motorcycle. Nice wide lanes you can split down, and you can park your bike on most footpaths for awesome access to just about anything. So if you're at all interested in bikes, this is a beaut place to ride them. Sure as fuck shits on public transport.  




 It's training. Easier if you do it earlier, but I believe if there's nothing physiologically wrong with you, you can learn.  




 *timbre 




 That's how basic traction control works when it has different levels you can select. Slide control is a bit more complex as I understand it. 

The latest and greatest bikes are starting to run inertial control units that can get very accurate readings of things like your lean angle, the pitch of the bike, g-loads and yaw. I believe slide control uses the lean angle and yaw readings to allow the bike to get a certain amount of sideways happening before it gently intervenes. 

I've only had one quick track session on it, and I was focusing on the active suspension out there, so I didn't play with that setting. But the electronics are just getting more and more amazing.  




 The new S1000RR has slide control.  




 He sure does seem to ride like a man who hasn't figured out how hard the ground can be yet. Magic.  




 He's got that humble dunk attitude though. I wanna see him break out a bit of flash.  




 I was looking for Gerald Green.  




 DONGGGG 




 Mind you the really cutting edge stuff from silicon valley rarely seems to work on android first.  




 For the continuity stuff, you can get pushbullet for android. Works great.  




 ...and those fucken mushrooms. Dear god they are just ridiculously good.  




 Dunno what side of town you're on but there's a taiwanese restaurant opposite Malvern station that sells it as 'XXL chicken' as well.  




 SOUND BATHS! SIGN ME UP!  




 Best in-game dunker in the league. OH YEAH I SAID IT 




 We'll know in a day or two!  




 I'd say don't bother with a camera until you can afford one that is stabilized. The vision is useless, and the cameras weigh the quads down, reducing maneuverability and flight time.  




 Melbourne, Australia. It's about to become legal here in a limited sense but has been tolerated add long as I remember. I split every chance I get and will change lanes if I can't get through. I'll fold in my mirrors if things get tight. I make sure I don't hold car drivers up, and they don't hold me up, that's my rule.  




 Paywalled.  




 Big announcement from DJI tomorrow... 




 Brave is one word for it.  




 You're probably right. But you never know.  




 How you feeling about this at this point?  




 Extraordinary work, mate. Get yourself a license and go commercial with it.  




 Yes, because the usual crowd of bron chasers would flock to follow him. For all his many vaunted skills, team stacking may be his most powerful ability.  




 Correction: as I understand it, the terms of the TPP are to be kept secret for FOUR YEARS AFTER IT IS SIGNED.  




 Can you do us a favor and post a dyno chart?  




 Just tell 'em where the stops are and maybe any hits you want them to catch. Work with them in rehearsal or send them a recording of a groove if you like.  




 In all seriousness, this is why I recommend if you're gonna go and ride hard, you should learn how to wheelie and stoppie. When a wheel comes up you should know how to handle it, and the best way to practice that is in a safe place at lower speeds.  




 I generally get along well with Canadians - same as kiwis and scots. I think all us little brother countries have a similar attitude.  




 I don't see a lot of hate for AD, Curry or Durant. The guys that cop it do for a reason.  




 Get a bit of mongrel up ya Wiggins! Don't gimme that fluffy weak crap! 









 He broke back in again though. 




 Who's cuddling up and enjoying movies? I look at that guy and experience about double the 'holy shit' factor I get from Arnie - it's an awe inspiring display of insanely hard work and discipline combined with jackpot genetics and the best nad shrinking drugs money can buy. Arnie's physique is stunning but believable. This guy is so far beyond that, it looks almost like another species.  




 I believe that's how it works. So players can be totally confident they won't be tested again after their 4th check. Seems ridiculous to me but I think it's part of the deal with the players' union. 




 The NBA needs to publish the dates of when each player gets his 4th and final 'random' drug test for the year. 




 Bummer eh. I suppose it must be a touch demoralising being a stand-in and knowing you'll be sitting behind one of the greatest in the game as soon as he's healthy again. 




 What the heck happened to PJ3? He looked like durant-lite for stretches when KD was out. Did I miss a memo somewhere? 




 Yep I thought I was a goner. Passenger had no idea til she saw the video... That was the last time she got on a bike. 




 Maaaaate who needs brakes? They just make you go slow.  




 I was there too. Stonking motorbike. That suspension... Wow.  




 This is me on the bike. Looking back at it still scares the shit outta me. https://youtu.be/9TxEw1LunfM
