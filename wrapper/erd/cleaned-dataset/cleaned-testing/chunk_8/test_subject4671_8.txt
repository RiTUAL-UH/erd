 3 you the best 




 whats up with the formatting for the EG games?
 




 man...Bang threw that game so hard 




 iirc at the time EG was looking into signing a team but didnt because they were unwilling to drop their dota squad...and since Scoots was 2 or 3rd in charge of EG at the time he is a credible source. I think it was in his real talk with JP..have to see if i can find a time stamp 




 Didn't sir scoots(formerly of EG) confirm this during an interview? 




 I always respond with "I love me too" 




 see title 




 if you are in your 20s/30s I've found okcupid to be the best in terms of getting actual response 




 how is this game played if I'm ambidextrous? 




 said male may be interested in you and using the "you're so quiet" line as a conversation starter...i know i'm guilty of this 




 very true. but the lack of warding/overextending exists outside just IG/WE is endemic of the entire chinese scene. If tsm wards and plays "safe" they should shut down the OMG roam and may have chances to make their own picks 




 The only game I can see going any other way is the OMG vs TSM match. having watched most the LPL I'm very concerned about OMG's laning phase and their tendency to over extend. We saw in all-stars that the US can punish these chinese tendencies in lane and TSM just might have the team fight coordination in the late game to finish OMG off. 




 these times are way outside NA prime time. NA prime time is 7 EDT to 10 EDT. This starts at 10pm and goes to 2AM EDT most nights so even us East Coast US people are screwed...oh and we dont even have a good server. 




 What Doa was saying is that the items bought with their gold leagues create huge power spikes for their respective champions.  




 assuming you dont have subscription to OGN it looks like the VODs are slowly being uploaded to LolChampSeries on youtube. 









 I feel like a lot of girls i know pull this look off regularly 




 Lg-IM already has 2 LOL teams, MVP has arguably the best LOL team MVP Ozone...thus makes sense. 




 ps3 plz 




 Didn't Ryan slit his throat? I swear I remember that being the end of an episode  




 i think ryan is missing some kills..namely the son of the mayor...name escapes me now :( 




 for me i hate small talk because it prevents me from getting to know the "real" person i'm talking to. Plus talking just for the sake of talking is exhausting 




 I know I personally unsubscribed BC when I bought gold pass I was promised 4-5 major sc2 LANs(Orlando, Anaheim, Raleigh, cbus, providence?) a year...and now MLG has not only cancelled sc2 coverage..but they stopped coming to my area(Raleigh) 




 whats the best way to support this effort? watching the videos? liking the videos?  




 as a sc2 player, neither Day9 nor HD(who isnt even involved in the scene anymore) are considered analytical casters. Day9 especially has been exposed over the past year for being a self hyped glorified play by play guy. 




 dont  look at others peoples numbers, the only person you are competing with is yourself. Push yourself while knowing your limits, nail form over big numbers, and most importantly have fun 




 who is the OP of this post...how can you not love chobra?! 




 which is why EG have thresh/twitch/xin because it allows for great disengage/kiting 




 while correct. for about the last 10 minutes eg was grouped allowing NIP to respond. Also, Wicked was not split pushing at all. if they had employed a 3-1-1 split push they could have take towers much easier. 




 two teleports...refuse to split push...it makes no sense 




 i feel like they aren't pushing enough...when did their first tower go down? it seems like its too late. IN ogn when this is run(usually cait/ez) its based off a really fast tower push based on nunu/nasus 




 its a solid comp..double ad has been dominating in korea...CLG just refuses to use the fast push that it requires to work. 




 in this case indicating skyrim will be next 




 That's the thing that annoys me most...at least give us an update on twitter or SOMETHING.  




 Is the wcs europe stream down for anyone else. I'm on android using twitch app and the English stream has been offline for about 45 mins now. I can still see games via Russian and Spanish streams...but obviously they aren't the same 




 As someone who does crossfit and is huge into the Esports community I think Esports has a higher chance..mostly because individual components of Crossfit are already in the olympics. Also, the olympics kinda works off a predefined format where the variation the crossfit games provides cant  be  replicated. Also, League of Legends is getting huge with their LCS players being officially recognized as athletes by US govt for passport purposes.  




 i'm pretty sure that to make up for this, c9 went void staff instead of Frozen Heart 




 had ryze hitting his power spike with spirit visage, tear, roa(aka the Dade Ryze build) as TF was falling off at the same time 




 stephano was imba when he was on mill..kinda fell off after joining eg...and jaedong only looks get when playing vs zerg or foreigners 




 your joke wont counter the eg curse :( 




 this happens to me and i have cox...i think its a riot issue. Hampton VA 









 i can only assume he is talking about Catz getting invited to hsc and not going...but the reason he didnt go is he didn't want to pay for flight...so not sure i understand his point 




 Norfolk is the best. if your work takes you to the other side of the water I would suggest http://www.crossfithamptonroads.com/

 




 Last night when I went to bed it was easily number 1 on here. I'm guessing a lot of people changed their minds after reading monte 




 excellent execution of the feed the khaxiz strat. superior team fight potential. C9 won at champ select. 




 both buffs getting stolen is rare for sure. but dig did nothing with those two buffs. for example if the had used all 4 buffs to stop towers from going down and/or to push bot lane tower they would have had a lead. but c9 played a smarter(korean) style 




 and this can all be fixed by going bt into blue ezreal build 




 I'll try my best but this question as a whole is better answered by a guy like monte cristo. Lets start as the buffs are getting stolen. c9 has 2 options, contest with multiple players(putting each lane at a disadvantage) or letting them take them. Nasus then goes immediately to the 2v1 lane bc jungle nasus takes spirit fire first allowing easier wave clear for an even faster tower. As soon as C9 takes first tower the have map control and can dictate the pace of the game. C9 switches their duo back to bot to prevent dig from taking a fast tower and to keep pressure on dragon.

C9 keeps pressure on lane and slowly push all lanes. The slight lull in action we saw during mid game is bc jayce becomes a monster in team fights around the 18 min mark or whenever muramana is complete.

support takes oracles earlier and often to keep map control and allow for more psuhing. this is standard korean play 




 Trick question right? I always ate all my candy on Halloween 




 especially since he a producer of all their english streams. 




 The korean guy is Chobra. he is the english/korean translator for ogn.
The guy on the right is Montecristo, he is the artosis of LOL. He is also a former WC3 player and a SC2 player 




 and resistance series, and infamous series, and little big planet  




 i'm on 480 fine...i'm watching the osl streams though 




 I forgot I was subscribed to ogn stream..thought vods were available for everyone 




 May I suggest twitch.TV streams which are free? 




 This is a joke IMO. Purposefully having the bracket so that no one race can appear dominant. Such a shame.  




 I promise I won't tell the party  




 next week do we find out that uncle oris is actually tugabutt's father(horribly disfigured from being crushed by an ogre). Then he goes on to kill ~~Emperor Palpatine~~ dalamar? 




 i didn't catch a lot of the cast but I think the one thing i would say is to practice intro to the game starting/outro to commercial break. I know its really tough to pull off but it is awesome when done right. 




 him and montecristo are AMAZING for the OGN LOL stream. They have such great synergy. Haven't watched their SC2 casts but it shouldnt be bad 




 Have they fixed the horrible memory leaks in it yet? Last time I tried it, it was unusable  




 The same thing happens if you use Google chrome in a nonfull screen window 




 Sorry. I thought you were correcting the English of first post BC you were pro bring MC  in to cast 




 His sentence is correct assuming the emphasis is on the importance/quality of the game being played(aka a proper game) 




 but getting people fat means they need to be fat means they can get fat again.. 




 that business model 




 have you been to sc2ratings.com  ? 




 As a diamond NA I can confirm most of us want to sit back and defend till 200/200 




 when i get to stream it usually always has 10k viewers 




 qxc went full mech..you never go full mech 




 you spoke to early

his internet died. 




 If you can afford it, subscribing for the VODs is definitely worth it if you watching league. The qualiber of play will shatter your mind. If you can't afford it I suggest checking out the GPL English YouTube channel. You see crazy stuff in Asia(support veigar) 




 that looked like the same area the have lcs matches today 




 TCC: at least its not Thomas Nelson ;) 




 James Madison sucks. go ODU! :D pretty cool getting to meet MMA
