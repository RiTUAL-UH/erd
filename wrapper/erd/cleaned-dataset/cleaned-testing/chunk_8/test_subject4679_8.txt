 I'm a psychologist in Vancouver Canada with an interest in NEETs and Hikikomori. I've seen many people in my practice who show all the standard features of this problem, and psychologists around the world seem to be reporting the same thing. So there may be some specific cultural features (in Japan for hikikomori; perhaps in the UK where the NEET term is most often used), but there are probably common features as well. 

At the moment I'd be interested in input on a particular question. Given that there is probably no single factor that caused the issue in most cases, what are some of the important factors that you believe contribute to the problem? Extra points if you're speaking about personal experience, but don't say anything that will reveal your identity.  

Maybe only one cause or factor comes to mind.  If so, what is it? If more than one occur to you, what are they? 

Thank you for any help you can give. 




 I'm a psychologist in Vancouver Canada with an interest in this area. I believe that much of the discussion in the academic literature on the hikikomori issue is misguided - it focuses on the question of why this problem is specific to Japan, and what the unique features of Japanese society are that might contribute to it.

But it isn't unique to Japan. I've seen many people in my practice who show all the standard features of this problem, and psychologists throughout the West seem to report the same thing. It may - or may not - be more common in Japan, but it certainly isn't unique to it.

At the moment I'd be interested in input on a particular question. Given that there is probably no single factor that caused the issue in most cases, what are some of the important factors in your own life? I'm not asking anyone to list ALL of them. Maybe only one comes to mind.  If so, what is it? What are they?

 Yes, both homelessness and suicide are more prevalent in men, though problems like depression seem more common in women - and hikikomori seem often depressed or, at minimum, socially very anxious (which has a more even gender ratio). There are suspicions that people edging toward the Asperger's (high functioning autism) spectrum may be more likely to become hikikomori, and all ranges of autism are more common in males. But I suspect this is more a matter of fad-ism - Asperger's is presently in the public consciousness and as a result is likely being grossly overdiagnosed. A person we might formally have called socially phobic or avoidant is today likely be labelled Asperger's - and I think mislabelled for the most part. 




 This may well be true in Japan. But the gender imbalance that I'm thinking of is in Canada, where there doesn't seem to be an expectation that women stay home at all. In fact, few clinicians seem to have met women with this issue.

As a side note, the phenomenon also seems to be almost uniquely a heterosexual thing. None of the clinicians I've spoken to have seen a gay man with this issue. This may be a numbers problem - there are more straight than gay men - but the number of cases I'm talking about suggest otherwise.  




 I like your comments particularly within the spoiler section. Without giving away any spoilers myself, I would echo the sentiment that what seems like a painful but necessary step for many people who are stuck in their lives is to relinquish the fantasy that they have been engaging in - a fantasy that feels like it sustains them but actually keeps them stuck - and deal with humdrum reality instead. By giving up on my dream of being a wealthy rock star and getting an average job, etc, I may feel like I'm losing out but I'm actually trading an ultimately unfulfilling fantasy for a satisfactory reality. 




 I like that phrase - "smear flowers onto the issue." 

I wonder about the "life is horrible" thought. It surely is in many places - Gaza, Iraq, Sudan. Most of Sato's life, though, isn't really all that bad. He has a home, he has food, and yes, it isn't given to him and he needs to find a way to get it. His mind is in a very painful place, but he actually has the resources to get out of that place, as he discovers when he begins to use them.

Sato's internal world is one in which people are constantly laughing at him and criticizing him. But in fact most of this is imagined. Some people do criticize in the series, but not nearly as much as he trashes himself. In fact, in the street scenes he is generally as anonymous and unnoticed as he would like to be.

I agree completely that the solution is often to give up on the idea of the magical fairy (Misaki, a girlfriend, a psychologist) to come and save us, and instead to take the reins of our life and do it ourselves. 




 I may get myself into trouble with this reply, but I think one of the problems is often society's emphasis on ultra-achievement. For you to become good enough you have to be a high-powered lawyer, a heart surgeon, an internet billionaire, etc - roles that a) most people will not achieve, b) would not suit most people, and c) many people feel skeptical about anyway ("I get to drive a Ferrari but I got there by destroying the environment, climbing ruthlessly over others, or otherwise violating my ideals").

Sato and Yamazaki fantasize about the big score - becoming heads of a mammoth game development company. Whether they do or not (no spoilers there), what seems to help many people is relinquishing wild dreams and alighting on planet Earth, getting a job not because it is a great passion or "fulfills my soul" but because it pays rent and may serve as a stepping stone to the next bit of my development. 

In Canada everyone has had the experience of being stuck in snow and feeling the temptation to tromp on the gas pedal and spin the wheels 0 but when you do that you don't go fast, you just lose traction. To get out of the hole, you need to go very slowly and gently. That seems to be how people get out of the hikikomori life as well.  




 Many would agree with you. Personally, I am relatively unimpressed by my field's fascination with diagnosis. We take a difficulty with living (a tendency to fall into one of life's many traps, let's say) and call it something it actually isn't: a disease. So we take a person facing a challenge and tell them "You still have that challenge, plus now you have a mental illness" and we think we're helping. 

Therapy involves overcoming the sense that one is a victim of a disorder and developing a sense of agency and control in one's life. So my bias is not to call it a diagnosable disorder and just deal with the issue. But I am often a voice in the wilderness on that point. 




 I recently conducted an unscientific minisurvey amongst psychologist colleagues asking about gender ratio of this type of issue, without signalling my own suspicions.  Without exception, respondents identified this as a majority-male issue. Most stated that they had not seen a woman in this situation, though some had - and I agree that they are likely out there. There are no good epidemiological studies, but I believe the life is more of a draw (trap?) for males in general. 




 Could I add this remark to the blog post (or a followup) itself? You don't seem to be saying anything that would identify you, and I would not use your handle.
