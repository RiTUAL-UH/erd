 Since your blending and their in season, try adding some pineapple or mango for a sweet kick. Plus the butter and salt the other redditers said.

 I have never claimed this was my picture. I posted it a second time because I  was hoping to make the fudge this weekend but haven't been able to.

 WOW! I saw an almost identical one in NYC yesterday! http://imgur.com/H9EegZD

 I was eating the same cut of steaks when it popped up while I was surfing youtube. I had mine with a mushroom gravy and baked potatoes. 









 Bingo! Which is why having his wife give him one is so funny. 




 I was going to post the "Castle Truck" video as well but remember these guys are in Australia or New Zealand so they have different height rules than we do. I've also thought of doing this with a row of steel framed windows that can be lowered/raised into place for travel. Something like this but movable https://www.pinterest.com/pin/388646642820603133/ 




 This looks like a German version of Beef Braciole and you don't have to use the pickles but try some with just to try them out. 














 I know, right? I tried;( but I think if anyone would have gotten it right away it never would have been aired. Conan was not live then, am I correct? That's why it's such a great joke now. 







































 Is that at night? They have colored lights on the tower?

 And you took it BACK? Take it to a dealer, get it done right then get them to cover it. 




 Yes, there were a few.

 I wish I could have seen the "Oh Shit!" expression on my face. 









 The ONLY G Train Stop and Wait Here to Board Sign is posted 5 feet in front of the stairs, having never taken the G Train before I walked up those stairs and then down the platform past those 2 people in the picture. I was hoping to get in the first car to look out the window as the train went along the elevated tracks but to my surprise the train stopped WAY down the platform and the doors closed before I could run back down the platform so I had to wait for another train. The same thing happened to 2 guys when the next train showed up but I blocked the door so they could run down and get in. 




 Correct, but the sign is posted five feet BEHIND the stairs leading up to the platform. I walked up those stairs and then down the platform to wait for the train, who knew the G Train has so few cars having never taken it before? 




 I thought that would go a different way ;) 




 No, someone just took the G Train for the first time. 
























 Your right, I don't know what I was thinking. Thanks for not being mean about it.

 You are correct http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/lamborghini-huracan-crash-video-2015-01-19 




 Nope, totaled http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/lamborghini-huracan-crash-video-2015-01-19  




 Whoever posted it to youtube got it wrong. They both survived! http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/lamborghini-huracan-crash-video-2015-01-19 




 They proved he lied about knowing the PEOPLE involved but because he didn't provide his text messages and emails they can't prove he lied 100%. Shame, really. I think if he just said I like the footballs I use to be a little under inflated and an equipment guy did it so his teams quarterback would be just that more comfortable in the game, everyone would have forgiven him and moved on. Has nobody learned nothing from Watergate? The coverup is always worse than the original crime. 




 I think they have raised their prices at least 5 times since then.
