 He was probably teasing his civil war involvement. which is now official.  




 That will change with direct x 12 though. http://wccftech.com/geforce-radeon-gpus-utilizing-mantle-directx-12-level-api-combine-video-memory/ 




 During the party scene Wilson mentions a missing persons case to cap. Anyone know what he was on about?  




 And this was mostly doing side missions to level up. The side missions are just as entertaining as the main story and a lot of the side missions link up with the main story line. Now I'm level 10 and I'm about to resume the main story line. This game is amazing. Its gonna keep me busy for months! 














 i watched it in 2 days.  




 I actually agree with them. I thought the VFX this season were really good.  




 Works for me here in NZ.  




 yea and I can get on the store just fine.  




 eh steam isn't down.  














 Get the 4gb model. Now a days games are using more vram than 2gb.  














 So let me see if I understand this correctly. Becuase of the alternate timeline and what not that the flash going missing happens a lot earlier than 2024? I'm guessing the black whole was the crisis also?  




 970 here. Played for 4 hours straight no problems.  









 You can run the witcher 3 just not on ultra or high settings.  














 I'm getting it on PC.  




 The wait is so painful especially when people on twitch are already playing it.  




 No begging.  




 I have this one to! its awesome.  









 here's the original interview if anyone's interested its around 3:10 when ruffalo appears. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0grQvejhFtU 




 its regional pricing. Everything is devalued over in the ukraine no idea why.  




 fyi this infographic is a bit out of date. Doctor Strange is out in November not July.  




 fyi I think this infographic is a bit out of date. Doctor Strange is coming out in November not July.  




 they moved it forward back in October when they announced phase 3. James Gunn announced the new date.  









 They will make it. Just not now. Probably in phase 4.  



















 Kayran from the witcher 2. such an awesome and challenging fight it was.  









 proably high settings at 1080p.  




 it will run it fine. Its just bullshit marketing. Nvidia trying to sell their 900 series cards.  









 I think present day Barry is gonna get stuck in the future and the whole flash vanishes in crisis will happen earlier than 2024 because of wells speeding things up. 




 Starling city is under attack and Barry be like. Nah I need to have a chat with my buddy wells.  









 Is Stephen Amell done with arrow? The way it ended it would seem like it. Or are they just sending Oliver away so that Amell can film TMNT2 and then return when hes done? 









 So Oliver appeared as the arrow on the new episode of the flash.He's seen wearing league gear. Anyone got an explanation to this and where it fits into the timeline? 









 Yea I know deadline and various other sites are saying its gotten a 13 episode renewal so I was curious and checked the official facebook and twitter pages of POI and I see they haven't announced on ether of those services that the show has been renewed yet. Is it possible their still deciding on the whole 13 episode thing? since deadline was the only one mentioning it maybe they jumped the gun a bit to soon and had an unreliable source? you'd think like other shows they would want their fans to know they have been renewed.  




 there is still one episode left.  




 Did that reference confirm GL is gonna appear eventually in the Flarrowverse? 




 Netflix
Hulu
Amazon (Prime)
TNT
Starz
ABC

Any others you guys think would suit POI?
 




 I could see amazon picking it up. they seem to have a good relationship with WB with amazon prime and all.  




 I find it interesting how Brett Dalton (Ward) seems to be back in the main cast.  




 We have two episodes tonight so we could find out then.  









 How can this Sub evolve if its not allowed to change? 




 and in one of the marvel one shots they reference blonsky and in agents of shield the abomination gets name droped.  














 Say for instance I get off my horse and go exploring for a bit come back after a while. Can my horse be attacked by other creatures and even die? 




 The Witcher 3 obviously.  




 I love it. very different from the american trailer.  









 interesting. mine shows 3.92gb http://imgur.com/2oFz5KI 




 Doesn't happen to me. weird. I got it on steam.  




 the best part lol "do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers" 




 OMG THIS. My mum does this all he time and she doesn't undestand why I get pissed off. its so damn annoying. Ill be like shut the door please after shes talks to me and shell just walk away. lol.  




 Red Skull anyone? 




 why do all of his movies suck so bad? 









 Action movies. I have no shame. I liked transformers 4 lol.  









 You have to remember they are marketing to a completely different audience in Japan. what seems like a spoiler or ruined moment to us probably doesn't to them. Its a very different and tough audience to market to.  









 Anyone else get the feeling their up to something? Especially Agent Weaver I get an evil vibe from her when ever she gets involved in discussions and mission plannings its like shes hiding something and shes got her own motives for doing things.  




 LOL thats bullshit.  




 Damn and no word on Fox shopping the show around to netflix or hulu :( 




 The blacklist already got renewed for season 3.  




 Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! 




 Not at all. Chris Evans was the human torch and Captain America. Why can't Hardy be The Punisher and a DC character?  









 How do you think season 9 will open and where do you think everyone will end up?

I think Leonard and Penny will get married

Raj will continue dating Emily despite being weirded out by her

Howard and Bernadette will ether kick Stuart out within the first few episodes or something will happen to Stuart that forces them to let him stay with them. 

Not to sure about Sheldon. He might try and get Amy back but the way they ended the episode it seems pretty clear the relationship is over at least for now. Really looking forward to see how the writers handle this. 
 




 wooo 3 hour podcast hype.  









 lets say he is Spider-Man and the whole "casting a younger actor" was just a ruse, do you think he'd be a good choice?.  




 Finally he gets in on the action and he now knows whats really been bothering Felicity! This was long overdue she should of told him about the league like 3 or 4 episodes ago.
 




 I don't care what people say Im watching them in the order their aired.  




 As soon I saw how Oliver reacted when he heard that maseo gave ra's the bioweapon I knew he wasn't brainwashed.  




 why the heck would I skip an episode of the flash? gtfo.  




 Not gonna happen.  




 No one is hating on it. its just age of ultron didn't live up to the hype for a lot of us. its still a good movie but a lot of us feel underwhelmed by it.  




 Everyone has their own opinion. But I liked the movie alot. I personally think Norton is a better Bruce than Ruffalo. You should still watch it, it has a lot of great moments.  









 Why did you get a 5930k instead of a 4790k? you could saved money and got a better gpu.  




 Mean while Civil War will actually be the big kahuna that we're all waiting for and marvel decided that age of ultron along with ant-man were just a bridge to fill the gap while we wait. It was almost like a filler episode of a tv show setting up and teasing whats to come and didn't really move the plot forward aside from meeting some new characters. Maybe this was intentional or I just picked up on it due to Whedons background work on TV? It just felt like an episode of a tv show that plays before the finale you know what I mean? 









 I like the story to. Multplayer not so much. Mainly because I just don't have the time to invest in it.  




 I think the very concept of supergirl sounds stupid and just doesn't fit in the arrow and flash universe imo.  




 This is old news.  




 War machine is absent quite a bit in phase 2 we see him a bit in Iron Man 3 then all of a sudden he is a member of the new avengers? I guess we're to assume that a lot of stuff happened off screen between him and cap but id sort of like an explanation of what happened I mean sure he helped out in Ultron but does that make him worthy to be a member of the avengers? I guess maybe stark recommended him to cap as his replacement? 









 well he is a new avenger. so not surprising. would be kinda weird not to see him. 














 benchmarks or I don't believe you.  














 Well I saw someone mention it over on r/pcmasterrace that their was someone or a group of people working to bring the campaign to halo online.  









 Also looks like its gone up a couple of percent, before it was at 73% and I was worried it might drop below 70% hopefully it can work its way back up to at least 80%. 

http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avengers_age_of_ultron/ 









 What a movie indeed. so glad I finally I saw it. Colin Firth was a bad ass. Action scenes were really well done to. So happy to hear its getting a sequel it really is a sleeper hit. More people need to see this one.  




 Any thoughts as to why hes teaming up with Barry? if hes supposedly forgotten everything about Oliver it doesn't make sense unless Barry manages to get through to Oliver some how but Oliver keeps pretending hes brain washed when he really isn't just to buy time and figure out a plan.  




 yea its fair. i liked the first movie and loved guardians and cap 2. I found the first half of ultron a bit boring and tedious to get through.I didn't start appreciating the twins till the second half of the film. It definitely shows that Whedon is running out of ideas and its probably a good thing hes not doing infinity war. id say its fair. Ill be a bit worried if it keeps dropping though.  




 its sad that you have to point this out. people are so afraid to speak their opinion.  




 it was avengers assemble in most countries outside of the U.S.  




 Heres some of my ideas

Have an original avenger die. e.g stark or cap

Spider-Man swings in making his first appearance in an avengers movie. 

Have the avengers actually do some serious damage to thanos, thanos withdraws but we see a credit scene with him and his real army of villains and what ever aliens he might have at his disposal, ready to return in part 2. 

The guardians arrive to save the day. 

Got any other cool ideas? 

 




 Wow....  














 people hate on 2 and 3 but I like both I thought 4 was trash.  




 Since steam has pretty much gone to shit. Gog galaxy will be the next big thing, right? 









 power supply could be on its way out, maybe its not delivering enough power. it happens.  




 Not everyone wants to build their own.  




 you can https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KubRDApPHc 




 You know their gonna use that in their arguments now.  




 its a new zealand based store. its fully legit.  




 Or do I need to get an actual 3d monitor? 



















 no.  




 no. buying online is much more convenient as long as you get it from a good store like new egg or amazon.  




 and yet OP will be at the star wars episode 7 opening night.  




 i agree with this but what we can agree on is that the joker looks terrible. But his performance might be awesome. And that's what matters. 









 fake. 
























 RDJ has two more movies on his contract. Civil War and Infinity War Part 1. He will probably die in Infinity War.  









 I like it. it ties everything together.  




 I think at some point in the upcoming crossover with the flash, Barry is going to tell Oliver that he can travel back in time. I think Barry and Oliver will some how travel back in time and save Sara thus preventing any of this from happening and Oliver never has to join the league.  









 It was mostly small bits of the title music for spider-man 2 that I noticed quietly remixed in a couple of the action sequences involving Wanda Maximoff sounded very Danny Elfman esque.  




 i thought it was pretty weak. i haven't seen the movie yet but it just felt bit disappointing. I would of been happy if the spidey one was real.  




 Type cast? hes only been in guardians and now in Jurassic world. That is not being type cast.  









 broadwell cpu. Nice. 960m is also pretty solid. decent for 1080p gameplay.  




 I don't know why your being downvoted this would be the best option if something like this were to happen 




 They were standing in a police station i dont see how wells would of gotten away with it.  





























 By doing what ever the f I want  









 some of its ok if the chick sems to enjoy it but I've seen it to point where it sounds like their in pain and im just yea im done lol.  




 I actually don't mind this. lol.  









 I tried the code and it doesn't work.  














 I went to buy it from nuveem but its still not available there. Any other places that have the price as low as nuveem did?

 before I forget , credit to the original post http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/336yil/what_is_this_a_billboard_for_ants/ 




 Don't all marvel movies use the stero d logo? 




 it will be this year guardians of the galaxy I'm calling it now :) 









 they could be lying remember they said their was gonna be no post credit scene for the first one and then bam we get the Shawarma scene.  














 its not aborted. its still in the pipeline its just being reworked to accomodate the new spiderman.  




 the iron man reboot is quite interesting. its good to know they have a plan when RDJ eventually leaves.  




 god damn i love these emails. hilarious.  




 https://wikileaks.org/sony/emails/emailid/88763 




 If he wanted to watch any of the prequels he could probably get away with just watching revenge of the sith it has enough back story for anakin imo.  




 Its apparently from the hacked sony emails. so it could be legit.  




 There are too many story lines and we need to choose which ones we are focusing on and lift out the other ones, ie; could reduce father arc to just Roosevelt?
 
Could cut out plane crash and Richard destroying spiders and start on armored car  dont start with Spider-Man.let the danger/stakes to NYC build first and then have Spider-Man enter the scene heroically.
 
Tone down Paul Giamatti performance, so he seems a bit more menacing and less cartoonish.
 
If you cut Richard from the opening and the plane crash maybe you could instead do Harry coming home and seeing Norman at the top of the movie as a cold open.
 
Really love Electro  feels like you may not need the scene in his apartment, which makes him seems completely crazy and hard to relate too.
 
Like the idea that eel goes in his mouth and instead of burrowing, you see it glow within him
 
Need to set up the Power Plant earlier, visually.
 
Seems like the movie switches povs a lotwhy are we in Maxs pov during the car chase, worth looking at this playing out from Spideys pov.
 
There could be a better way to reveal that Peter is missing graduation  maybe when you cut Gwen you cut to the wide shot? 
 
Tiny note  dont think Peter would lie to Gwen about sirens --- maybe he just downplays it
 
Stan Lee Cameo  maybe need a little more emphasis on Peter here trying to get out of his costume and not be in seenset up a little more the pressure of the principal getting closer and closer to calling his name.
 
Instead of seeing the ghost of Captain Stacy, can just here the voice in Peters head and maybe flash back to the last movie?  Dont think we should add Cap Stacy back into car chase.
 
There is too much back and forth with Peter and Gwen  can we recut the Dim Sum scene so that it doesnt feel so repetitive of their break-up in the last movie  Can Peter be more honorable and definitive and less wishy-washy?
 
Why do we need a year to pass
 
Harry story feels like the main plot of the movie  Peter should look into the past b/c of Harry  maybe find some photos of them together as kidsuse obsession wall more to set up this part of his past not just what happened to parents.
 
Not sure what Peter learns at Roosevelt is entirely correct. Were distracted by the idea that Peter became Spider-Man b/c of his fathers blood --- all this special back story with his super-scientist dad fights with the idea that Peter is normal kid from Queens who becomes the greatest super-hero in the world
 
Andrews performance is all over the placea lot of crying and then a lot of mania. Hard to track him emotionally sometimes. It undermines his reaction to Gwens death b/c he gets upset and emotional a lot.
 
Dont like the idea that May tells Peter his parents were spies b/c two seconds later he finds out they are not and it again fights with the idea that hes an ordinary kid.
 
Like the idea that May finds out hes Spider-Man  finds his costume instead of just the rosemary harris wink-wink all the time.
 
Kind of like the morgue, but hate the dancing mortician  clich.
 
Are you using VFX to show how Electro is travelling from one point to another (bursts of electricity).
 
Need to underscore capture of goblinmore sirens as you linger on the clock 1;21, 1:22 am (nice touch).
 
Surveillance scene should be about following Harry not Peterno one should be following Peter.
 
Can Electro hum Itsy-Bitsy Spider before he plays it electronicallymaybe we can use this again.
 
Maybe intercut the ending montage and hearing Gwens speech with someone going into special projects and revealing more easter eggs and see that the rhino case has been broke into and the suit is missinggreat way to transition to rhino ending.
 
Dont need Aunt May in the kitchen.
 
Spider-man needs to feel more directly responsible for preventing the planes from crashing.
 
Dont show New Yorkers looting. 




 I felt like they just released this teaser because they needed to before people forgot about the movie it didn't interest me at all except for the cool dialog from batman at the end. Maybe I was all hyped out from star wars. Hopefully the second trailer is better.  




 All of them. Find which suits your tastes better and stick with that.  




 They already have announced a spin off movie. its called rogue one.  









 Transcendence is so bad tho. I usually like Depp but his performance was so bland.  




 i hated 2 but like 3 and 4 and 1.  




 The Star Wars prequels. I grew up with these and love them. You guys had the OTT and I had the prequels and you cant take that away.  









 i think skyrims even gone cheaper than that for like $3 or something.  









 it was available in 3D in countries outside the U.S. 









 I am and I cant fucking wait! 




 Space battles will probably come later with DLC. I guarantee it. Don't tell me DICE don't have something like that planned in the future.
