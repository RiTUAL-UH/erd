 That technique works wonders in r/news and r/worldnews as well.  




 To be fair, I've known plenty of guys who have made a tinder account for the same reason. But I do agree that their are some super shitty people on those apps. Congrats on finding your SO by the way! 




 I think that viewing this situation in an empathetic manner is key. We should be empathetic for op who is a person who happens to be a guy; it's unfortunate that he was labeled as a rapist/sexual predator/etc. simply because he was walking in the same direction as a person who is a woman was walking. We should also be empathetic for the person who is a woman, however, because her feeling threatened by such a little thing is also unfortunate. While I am in no way condoning her being rude afterwards - wrongly accusing someone as being something as heinous as a sexual predator is not something that should just be brushed off and ignored because such a title carries significant social and legal repercussions for the person receiving the title - the fact that we live in a world where such caution needs to be taken shows that a problem of how we as a society handle sexual assault - both in terms of the treatment of the victims of the crime and the people who are wrongfully accused of committing or planning to commit such inhuman acts - does exist. In my perfect world, people who are women would not have to always feel fearful of being the victims of rape/sexual assualt/etc and people who are men would not have to live in fear of having their benign actions being viewed as lecherous motives.  




 Damn, I didn't know that you could smoke WITH bubblers! Are they good at cornering?
