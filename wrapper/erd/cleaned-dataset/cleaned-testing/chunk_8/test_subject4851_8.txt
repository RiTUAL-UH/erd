 You are actually in agreement, even though your first words are in contradiction with everything else you/I have said. Education is not equivalent to college. There are many many forms of education. But, a ward of the state must be offered some training to become useful in society. Failure to fulfill this obligation, on the part of the state, is leaving such a person to do what they must to survive, which, unfortunately, very often leads to a life of 'crime'.

So yes, your initial description is spot on. 




 Why do you think it shouldn't be free? Please offer the reasoning behind your thinking. 




 And if so, how do you propose we accomplish a zero cost of education for every citizen of the United States. 




 I'm sorry man. Thank you for clarifying what you intended to say. 
But, because of where I am from, I can not but reject your logic. If desperation is a licence to forsake virtue, then all is lost. Case in point: much of Sub-Saharan Africa. Many of these people can be considered 'descent' human beings as evidenced when they migrate and are immersed into 'developed'/'stable' economies in Europe or America. But take a look at the turmoil, violence, corruption and all manner of ills which, according to your logic, is perfectly acceptable because they are 'starving' to death.


 




 Cool. I'm almost done with my graduate studies. I'm trying to learn German in the hopes to do a postdoc and work a few years as a researcher there before I move to Africa where I feel there is a much more serious need for education and, to a smaller degree, applied research. 




 Where did you move to?
edit: might-move. For the life of me, swipe makes my writing sound retarded. 




 There is no where in the world that says this is what financial aid should be. You describe the status quo, which is broken. For a civilized country, a well educated citizenry is the only way to remain civilized. This is the primary role/function of any state. It is the very reason for its existence!

edit: primary 'rule' - primary role/function 




 This is still not right. It's unaffordable period. 




 Here's an idea, let's make this the number one election issue. I mean, every young person in the nation votes on just this one issue: the candidate who will make free education, and I mean completely free education, his / her number 1 (and probably only) priority!
 




 Why are you still under your parents? Why are they still claiming you as a dependent? 




 Details. How did this work out? 




 He meant puking outback steaks he had the night before, folks. No? 




 I think that cut a little too deep for some folks. Leave noodles out of it man. Just leave it. 




 Where did you get that "they are more accountable" from? The most accountable form of government is at the local level. 




 Likewise bud. 




 Imagine living in a body with this punt of flexibility and fluidness day in and day out. That would be a delight. My kids will all do gymnastics and or ballerina. At least to learn how to move. 




 Wow. Vulgar but poetic. 




 This is true. But many people indulging in something does not make it right. 




 Look at this guy. First you ask me to agree to disagree and then you hit me with something I agree with! Just who do you think you are?!
Yes, clearly the planet has gone to shyt with very many people who should not be on this earth. Except they are here because people created an environment suitable for them.
What I think we agree to disagree on is what to do about them. You killing people is different from them dying.  




 The only place I see a difference is when you are defending a loved one or someone who is in immediate danger, and even in this case, as a last resort.
Note here that the overriding thought is to protect, help, save, these are all good things. But when you delve into the realm of revenge, the overriding thoughts are to inflict pain, suffering, etc never anything benevolent.
I believe it is the volition (thought/wish) behind an act that determines whether it is right or wrong (good or bad). 




 No I can not. What I see is two killers, and they both have their reasons. One for pleasure, and the other for revenge. 




 2ndly, Christ was also reported to have dined with the affluent as well.  




 You're not entitled to making or fabricating hypothetical interpretations where there are facts. According to the accounts Joseph owned his own shop. So hinting that he 'could have been employed by someone else' is just making things up.
But you can maintain your opinion, you are free to have them. Just pointing out that it is wrong. 




 Actually, the fed is big because of its role/powers. Shift the powers to the state, and they will be just as big. 




 Your comments are disturbing. The same hate that led the one you complain about is brewing in you. It is the exact same thing, can't you see that? 




 This is what every single person in the history of the world said. It's interesting how everyone has the feeling of uniqueness or being the exception. 




 This. How people cannot see clearly here that it's worded expressly to subject people to a group of people (namely the church), is just a result of lazy thinking. 




 States are also governments too. How come the desire for smallness doesn't extend to the state 'government'? 




 This is a common but deliberate misconception about Him. Joseph owned his own carpenter shop. Think small business owner and a healthy middle class family - no excessive wealth but also not poor. He was well to do. Being a carpenter and owning your own business with several employees isn't being poor!

Edit: Ah yes. Down vote facts because they do not conveniently agree with your self delusions. 




 Clearly sir, you need to grab a book on the subject. No, I mean that in all seriousness. Saying that one with virtues will be poor or destitute just shows you don't fully understand what they are and how they operate. 




 That other incentives pail in comparison. Virtues and their corrupt equivalents are far more powerful. Think about hate and how much it can motivate a person. No amount of money in the world can compare. 




 Not worrying about rent is not equivalent to not paying for it or setting to it that you have a means to do so. Look up the word worry.  




 I disagree. It's just a mind thing. 




 How do you figure that? Having 10000 people sign up is already 1 million dollars to 'process' people. Really, it's a line in a database you're paying $100 for... That is a LOT of money 




 Relax Bro. I heard your sigh from way out here. 




 I call bullshit seconds. 




 Ethics. Why do you not see anything wrong with this?
