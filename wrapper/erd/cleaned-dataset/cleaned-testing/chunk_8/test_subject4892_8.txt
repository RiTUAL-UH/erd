 Cool. 









 You *really* think Missouri is an Arkansas   Bama/MSU win away from being ranked in the top 4? The team that lost 34-0 to the only currently ranked team they've played this year? 




 As a counterpoint, Florida State is most definitely where they are purely because of their margin of victory. 




 I mean... Muschamp's 3 prior years at UF they've had the #10 (small class), #4, and #2 recruiting class. Being "not a great coach" is still pretty important. 




 Okay :( 




  I also previously predicted that since Minnesota was the first ranked team to lose and not move down a single spot

Utah was ranked 17th in the week 10 poll, lost, and still ranked 17th in the week 11 poll. Minnesota was not first. 




 Ok that's fair. Sorry, my heart rate is basically just set at 140BPM for the rest of the season. 




 If you think for one second the UCLA deserves, or that the committee is going to be in front of FSU, you're nuts. 




 Right now, we could probably use some of their linebackers. 




 Well we had 5 turnovers giving you several short yardage TD's and an offense that couldn't control an alarm clock.  




 Greenbow Alabama was filmed in Savannah, GA. Let the hate continue. 




 Well we'd be the other exception then because we have a better history than Florida. 




 Top 4 anyways. Depending on how you view Osborne, Wilkinson, Hayes, Joe Pa, and Bear. 




 I actually honestly don't. It's extremely hard to go 10-0* against bowl-eligible P5 teams. Especially when 6 of them have a bye or an FCS opponent the week before they play you.

*Depending on if Virginia beats VT next weekend 




 Yep, Florida State has 14, Texas has 9, but USC has never had more than 7, which was during the pete carroll era. 




 yea but 




 No way. If Oregon is the only school in front of you that loses you're still sitting on the outside. 




 Going by the BCS rankings for the BCS era. 




 and #3 vs. #127

EDIT SORRY WRONG POLL:

#1 vs. #127 




 But really though, I counted 5 drops that went straight through the hands of our recievers, including one in the endzone. We were getting murdered by drops, and to suggest that the rain helps with that isn't exactly a far reach. 




 In 2007, Kansas was ranked #2 behind 10-1 LSU. At the time Kansas did not have a single win over a currently ranked opponent. LSU had wins over then ranked #8 Virginia Tech, #12 Florida, and #23 South Carolina.

And for bizarre coincidence: Oregon could easily end up with its best three wins being #8 UCLA, #12 Michigan State, and #23 Utah; with FSU having no wins ranked in the top 20 on tuesday. 




 To be fair, both of those actions constitute a pretty awful job of regrouping. 




 Nah, we stay three this week, then drop to #6 or 7 next week with a loss to UF, then climb back up to #4 with a win over GT. 




 Fans get chaos. FSU gets to play in New Orleans. We all win. 




 It only has one eyebrow. 




 Florida State.

UF Zook's us for our final regular season game, meanwhile GT beats UGA, and Ole Miss wins the eggs bowl knocking Mississippi State out. Baylor loses to KSU, and Ohio State loses to Wisconsin the in the B1G championship game. FSU proceeds to knock out #13 ranked GT in the ACCCG and climbs back up into 4th, with TCU being the 3rd seed. 




 I mean - he probably definitely should have been ejected going by the rulebook. But any given college football game has dozens and dozens of actions where the referee crew varies from the rule book (see: the rulebook definition of holding), so I'm fine with the referee crew deciding that in this case his shove wasn't worthy of an ejection. 




 That ref shoving thread is an absolute bloodbath for nole flairs. 




 I don't think the FSU fans on the sub is that much of a difference. For starters, we have a quarterback that is absolutely hated by the sub (see [comments like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/2jny8u/post_game_thread_2_fsu_defeats_5_notre_dame_3127/cldgba4),) so right away the people we want to succeed are getting run through the mud by the masses. Additionally, there are a *lot* of people here who think we don't even deserve to be in the playoffs because of the way we played; something FSU fans disagree with. Those two factors working in concert have given rise to a back-and-forth of persecution complex and actual persecution between the FSU fans and everyone else.  

I think at the end of the day you have to decide the value of "quality wins", or how you look doing it, versus the fact that *you are simply winning.* We can all agree that in marshall's case the former clearly outweighs the latter, and in Oregon's case the latter outweighs the former. FSU is a pretty tricky middle ground though, because they've faced a decent but not too difficult overall schedule and have won unconvincingly, but the loss column is still the best in the country. Deciding which one is actually more valuable is a pretty impossible task. 

I side with FSU fans obviously, in thinking that even when we have a down game (or 6) and are dealing with injuries (11 starters missing time so far this season), managing to end up with the win anyways for 11 straight games is still an immensely value trait to have; and it's something no other P5 has been able to do. I definitely don't think we're the best team in the country, but I do think we're the hardest to beat. 

I think writing FSU off as lucky is extremely unfair. Nobody thought Auburn didn't deserve to be in the championship game because of that miraculous touchdown against Georgia, or the kick-6. I don't see why we shouldn't get the same benefit of the doubt. 




 Charles Kelly isn't terrible, but he's no Jeremy Pruitt and definitely no Mark Stoops. 




 Don't worry, we're like 2-0 this year when leading at halftime. 




 That's the Florida State first half we all know and love. 




 I think an important distinction to make is that Purdue hasn't won 5 national championships the last 30 years. 




 Fun fact: no player on an opposing team has had the game high rebounding total outright yet this season. Between Harris and Vuc we're 12-0 with two ties. 




 A little, yeah :/ 




 Congrats on proving that two of the 20 greatest players of all time could only barely carry bad teams to low playoff seeds. This for sure proves Kevin Love isn't one of the 20 greatest players of all time.

Great detective work indeed.

 




 Yep. Florida State actually has fewer overall games because 12 of their wins from 06/07 were vacated. 




 Fun little tidbit: As of this past weekend, there is almost a three-way tie for the most wins of the last 25 years. School records for 1990 to present are:

Nebraska: 238-78-1  
Florida:   237-77-1  
Florida State: 237-67-1

There are a lot of scenarios that could play out for the title. For instance, the UF/FSU game will probably decide who takes the lead between the two Florida teams. If Florida State makes it to, and wins, the national championship they could win outright; unless Nebraska makes it to, and wins, the the B1G and their bowl game. Nebraska has a tough final two games, and if they lose out Florida could take the lead by upsetting FSU. 




 Are you telling me an OJ Mayo/Dion Waiters backcourt wouldn't make you drool? /s 




 I don't think people quite realize, it's not that Marshall isn't a P5 school, it's that they have possibly the weakest schedule in the *entire* fbs division. Their four best wins would would seriously hurt any school in the top 15 as an OOC schedule. 




 Additionally, in future years if there are 4 1-loss schools with resumes like Oregon/Bama, which is not at all unlikely, it could very well mean leaving an undefeated team out of the playoffs. 




 FSU being ranked #1 would mean playing in NOLA which is way way more advantageous than a Rose Bowl game against Oregon. 




 I mean... maybe. As far as potential quality wins left on the schedule, a win over Ole Miss will probably look better than any of TCU's remaining wins, and whoever OSU ends up playing in the B1G championship game. Considering Miss St already has ground on both of them in the eyes of the committee it'll come down to what value a conference championship actually holds, but if I had to, I would definitely take MSU over both of those teams. 




 If that happened I don't think too many people would disagree that those two teams deserved to be in the final. 




 To be honest, I want Miss St. to beat Ole Miss and pass us... playing in New Orleans as the 4th seed would be way way better for us.

Or, Bama/Oregon losing would work too. 




 I mean, Bobby Bowden went 18 straight years without losing more than 4 games. 




 I don't know what Florida State has to do with a comparison between MSU and TCU. 




 It's hard to believe you guys should jump last week's #1 team in the country who suffered a road loss against this weeks #2 team in the country after you beat Kansas by 4 points. 




 Nope. Missouri will very likely climb back in as an 8-2 team.  the B1G will hold pat with 4. 




 I think it's highly unlikely. Even if one of Miss St./Alabama lose in the regular season and you defeat the other in SECCG, there's still  
- Oregon  
- FSU  
- TCU  
- Baylor  
- Ohio State

You'll probably have more impressive wins than most of them by the end of the year, but you also have two very bad losses. You probably need 2 of them to lose to be in. If both Bama/MSU win out and you defeat Bama, then MSU would still probably go over you guys as well. 




 I mean, we're 2 wins behind the winningest school of the last quarter-century (Nebraska, 238 to 236), and averaged 10.3 wins per season under Jimbo before Jameis came along, it's not exactly like we're a flash-in-the-pan success team. 




 I think us being ahead of TCU, with a much stronger remaining schedule AND a championship game against a presumably ranked team means that there's about 0% chance we fall out of the top 4 by going undefeated. If ASU jumped us it would be at the expense of beating Oregon, and I think there's basically no chance of tOSU or Baylor climbing ahead of us either.

Ironically enough, I would actually love to see Alabama beat Miss St., and Oregon win out, and us take the #4 seed over the #2/3 seed, because we'd fair much better in NOLA 5 hours away from Tally than at the Rose bowl. Or just taking the #1 seed would work too. 




 Yes, this. And for real life implications - if Bama beats MSU, I wouldn't be shocked for FSU to move to #4. If we continue to get close wins against our opponents, whose to say a TCU that dominates their remaining games with 1 loss against an 11-1 Baylor by 3 points doesn't jump them either? 




 Really? Not your quarterback? 




 Prostyle offense? Check  

Elite program looking for next years quarterback? Check

One more way to tell Urban Meyer to suck it? Check 




 A quick review of Alabama's wins against ranked opponents:

1. One overtime win against #20 LSU 




 Florida State hasn't had a losing record, at all, since 1977. 




 Fun facts: assuming we both win tomorrow, the totals since 1990 will be:

Nebraska: 238
UF: 237
FSU: 236

However you've also played 10 more games than we have, if you rank by win % we're 2nd among P5 teams at .771 and you guys are 3rd at .760; behind OSU at .774 




 We had a total of 2 bowl wins in school history before Bobby Bowden took over as head coach. We're currently ranked 113th all-time in total games played.

We are a very young program. 




 The Magic rookies Elfrid Peyton and Aaron Gordon will have 2 of the 4 best rookie seasons. 




 I know I know, I just have a chip on my shoulder as a huge Dipo fan the way Giannis was the rookie who came out of last year with seemingly all the hype. I take sick pleasure in belittling his accomplishments. 




 Fun fact: Aaron Gordon just surpassed Giannis' career high, at 9 months younger and with 77 fewer NBA games. 




 What are the 16 programs? 




 FSU was also the preseason #1 in 1993 when they won it all. Historically we've gone #1, #4, and #1 when ranked #1 in the preseason polls. 




 Kyrie Irving's 2nd career game without an assist.

The 6 total assists by the Cavs this game was a lower than any game by a team these for the past two seasons.

Damn. 




 He was really good at halftme adjustments last year too (see: Auburn), it was just never apparent because our starters were usually out halfway through the third quarter. 




 Honestly I would say he's simply gotten better as a coach during his tenure. We probably had the talent to go 12-2 his first two years as coach, and a team that should have gone 13-1 in 2012 (no way we were beating you guys the way EJ played), but his ridiculous conservativism held us back big time offensively; he's shown some really smart playcalling ability these past two years and he's definitely a huge reason we're 22-0 these past two seasons. 




 No, arguing halftime scores when talking about crushing opponents over a full game is never valid. 




 49-17 final score though. 




 Minnesota's last three games are against Iowa (6-2), Wisconsin, Ohio State, and Nebraska. There's a good chance they finish 7-5 or worse and are not really considered a needle-moving quality OOC win.

I hear you though, I think you guys are the better team for sure and are much more likely to make it, I was just responding to the post above that you guys aren't 100% safe as a Big12 playoff invite even if you win out. 




 I mean if Baylor wins out, they'll have a comparable schedule of good wins (one more better win, against you guys, once worse loss, against WVU), and I would imagine having the conference championship would be the tiebreaker in the committee's eyes. 




 Huh, I was misinformed. Thanks. 




 What did he say? 




 If Baylor wins out (including wins against Oklahoma, Okie St., and Kansas St.) they'll win the conference, and very likely could jump TCU. 




 This is actually incorrect, we vacated the win, but we did not vacate the appearance. So even going technically by ncaa standards we still have 33 consecutive appearances. 




 Definitely you guys; the UF alum network in the state of Florida is way more powerful than FSU's. 




 Standard scoring, need 1 starter:  
Lamar Miller v. SD  
Justin Forsett v. Ptt  
McKinnson v. Wash 




 What conference did you lose to again? 




 If* 




 Don't forget Clemson! 




 In no particular order, I think it will be:

1. Oregon - Survives Stanford, cruises through the final three games, and with a healthier O-line beats whichever Arizona team makes it to the Pac-12 championship game.

2. Kansas State - despite all three remaining tests being on the road, being the one elite big-12 team with very good defense allows them to win out.

3. Notre Dame - I think not falling very far after the loss to FSU benefits this teams greatly, and they make it by winning out. 

4. Georgia - For the SEC West, I'm predicting Auburn to lose to UGA but beat Alabama and Ole Miss; Alabama to beat Miss. State and LSU but lose to Auburn; Ole Miss to lose to both Miss. State and Auburn. That leaves Miss St. (who otherwise wins out) the SECw champion at 11-1 and all other teams with at least 2 losses. I think Georgia will beat Miss St. in the SEC championship game and is the only SEC team to make it because no other SEC team ends the season with only 1 loss. (Yes, I realize predicting that many games is ridiculous)

I think Florida State's shady offensive line and lack of run game will collapse against one of the best defenses in the nation this Thursday, and they lose to Louisville and are out of the playoff picture. I'm also predicting Ohio State to win out and beat Michigan State, but with a weak SoS and a bad loss, they end up being one of the one-loss teams on the outside looking in. 









 Seriously arguing Davis had a better defensive year than any of Dwight's from 2008-2012 using blocks, steals, and fouls as his substantiation is basically the definition of being a box score expert. 




 The thing with Tobias is that he's way more of a wildcard than Vuc. We, for the most part, know Vuc's floor as a player. Tobias varies between looking like a career backup worth $4m a year, and a career 19/8/3 guy worth max or near-max. I honestly don't even know what I would extend him for; 4/40 maybe? I can definitely see why he's going to be a bit more polarizing in extension talks. 




 I actually don't think they would. FSU has no ranked teams left on the schedule, so I don't see them getting a win that will launch them back into it. I expect at least one sec west school to finish with one loss and not win the division; and/or Georgia to be in if they win the SEC. Assuming FSU loses, two spots for SEC schools is a very likely scenario. 

With two spots left, I think Notre Dame, Oregon, Baylor, Kansas State, Michigan State, and *maybe* Ohio State would all pass them if those teams run the table, and I think the odds of 5/6 of them lose another game would be pretty slim. 




 Nope. That article's source is just another person speculating. Still no word as to whether he will or not yet.  




 Don't be a dick. 




 Well there are four teams in the SEC West better than the best team in the Pac 12 South so.... 




 I just mean Bobby v. Tom Osborne, sorry, vague language. 




 All I meant was that there's a very good argument that he's better than Tom Osborne, haha sorry; I don't think he's the greatest football coach ever. 




 I mean, objectively there's a very very good argument that he is. 




 Yep, if you do tax high net wealth individuals you may be 35-40hrs 40 weeks a year, but the month leading up to April 15th, and the two weeks leading up to Sept 15th and Oct 15th it's not unusual to go north of 90. It's very specific to your group (and even firm) within the profession. 




 That's the point of emphasis of his post. 




 It also matters that their two best players are still young and not in their prime yet. 




 Are we just ignoring Oladipo now? 




 Stop. 




 Why does the PAC 12 continuously do this to itself. 




 You realize that's very possible... right? 




 Yes. This is how rankings work. Everybody doesn't get to be in the top-25. 




 Oregon struggled worse than we did against arguably a worse team than we had, so even in spite of their win it's not like they don't have question marks. 




 Basically guarantees he **have** to run the table, but at the same time makes running the table a heck of a lot easier. 




 It's alright. The ACC only needs one ranked team anyways. 




 curious, how do you measure "moisture" as a percentage? 




 Ahhh crap, okay: Justin Forsett, TY Hilton or Terrance West at flex?? 




 In the last 30 years Florida State football is #1 in the nation (outright or tied) in the following categories:  
winning percentage overall  
winning percentage vs major conference teams  
winning percentage vs top 25 teams  
winning percentage vs final top 25 teams  
winning percentage vs final top 10 teams  
wins by double digits  
blowouts (20+ point wins)  
bowl appearances  
bowl victories  
Top 25 finishes  
Top 10 finishes  
Top 5 finishes  
wins vs bowl teams  
wins vs 10-win teams  
wins vs the SEC Champion  
wins vs the (eventual) National Champion  
total wins  
Heisman winners  

Florida State also has, by far the longest streak of top-5 AP finishes (14) and top-4 AP finishes (13). The second longest streak was Pete Carrol's USC at 7 for both.

Extending it out a little bit, Florida state is also reaching the all-time bowl appearance streak, currently at 32, and only behind Nebraska 35 (1969-2003) and Michigan 33 (1975-2007)
