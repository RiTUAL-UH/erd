 You mean (shudder) more Chihuahuas ? 









 Well you have to note one thing about the case. He presented his opinions on Twitter, not on a news broadcast. On his own time and not on company time so to speak. What happened then, and what is incredibly common, is that readers of the tweet took the time to track down who he was and mount a campaign, spreading a call from computer to computer, to **get** him. It worked. No doubt the campaigners felt that they had truly 'accomplished' something. When the dust clears, however, nothing in the social positions of the groups mentioned nor in government policy has changed at all. The 'victory' was purely symbolic and illusionary.

As the author mentions these sort of campaigns - and campaign it was - have become the standard crusades for both left and right. They serve as a substitute for real political action. The net result is a more restrictive public space and a build up of ill will on both 'sides' of what is called the 'culture wars'. 

This results in a certain amount of harm for a gain of nothing at all. 




 I can imagine that any planets laying in 'the line of fire' so to speak and close enough (how far ?) would be sterilized.  Most planets in any galaxy, however, wouldn't fit these two criteria. 









 Yes, in conversation with you and others I've been convinced that the headline is exaggerated.  





























 Well I disagree. Invoking the 'tu quoque' card may be a debate ender in philosophy seminars, but in the real world where interests are at stake (always) and it is a matter of political debate it is very much legitimate. In other words 'academic purity' is only applicable when there is absolutely nothing at stake. Life is not a seminar.

To be all academic about it the 'argument by analogy' I presented is very much to the point. No doubt any debt can be paid off if it is reduced enough and delayed long enough. A recipient of such generous largesse isn't on the 'moral high ground' when dunning others to 'replay their debt' unless, of course, they are willing to extend the creditor the same advantage they had. The whole matter is actually in the Bible where Jesus speaks of motes in your neighbour's eye and beams in one's own. One of the many quotations about hypocrisy. 



















 The first thing you should 'make of this' is that you should chose evidence that actually supports your case. The article you linked to states *very clearly* that there were times when the debt was reduced ie part of it was written off and the payment term extended. It is as if I were to take out a $5000 loan with an agreement to pay it back in five years. One year later my debt would be reduced to $4000, and the new terms were ten years. Six years later the debt would be reduced to $2000 and I would be given 20 years to pay. Finally, ten years later, the sum would be reduced to $500 and I was given a final 5 years to pay. At the end of that term I paid it off. I'd like it if I could get loans from the same lenders as Germany did.

As to 'tu quoque' it doesn't apply in a situation where the argument is about the moral standing of one party in relation to its denigration of another party. In that (this !) case "you too" is very applicable because the subject is very much the moral standing of an accuser.

 I know, but they are trying to enforce their policy a bit more strictly. This case isn't the only one where presently a true name could endanger the user. 
































































 I'd think the major concern would be the usual rail accident with far worse consequences. 









 If you're thinking of a new mission then 'next' is a matter of more than a decade. To my knowledge other missions have priority. 









 This has been discussed several times before. My main disagreement is that he says that humanity's 'war-like nature' will kill us off here on Earth. My trouble with this is that, if true, said nature will come right along with us into space. 




 It would be interesting to see such songs done in different genres...rap, country and western, blues, classical, etc. Could be fun. 




 Well, I have to say that that is an ingenious experiment. 









 I wonder if New Horizons will discover yet more moons. 





























 But that's beneficial to India in monetary terms. 




 Yes, that's possible in theory. Remember, however, that 'non-infectious' is not the same as 'non-pathogenic'. In terms of the microbiome an organism has to be 'infectious' in order to establish a commensal or mutualistic relation with the host. 




 I assume it means income as in "I live on my salary of x dollars per week. 







































 That's likely to happen. 









 It's been in the news in 'dribs and drabs'. The thing the NYT is reporting is the 500+ page report that has been released. 









 The authors discount that possibility. No doubt the pesticides aren't helping, but there are other factors at work as well. 









 It's sad. I hope it isn't indicative of a general trend of moral decay because of partisanship. 



















 I never noticed the analogy as well as you have, but it is for sure provocative. 














 Yes, the terminology is difficult. I presume they meant to include *both* recognition and the subsequent actions of the microbes. Personally I think 'selection' would have been a better choice, but then it would be confused with 'natural selection'. 




 I guess. Scientology, however, is not the only source of opposition to the theories and especially the practices of clinical psychology. It isn't even the most important one. What it is, however, is the organization that does it best to profit from the dispute. 














 My first guess is that they would be *more* likely to develop an allergy due to an enhanced response to such organisms. The establishment of tolerance as in the 'hygiene hypothesis' requires chronic exposure in my opinion, not the episodic exposure of a vaccine. 




 Thanks, that's an important thing to point out. 














 Try to watch what your bot is doing. 







































 Never in my basement, though there are usually a few nests just outside my side door. 









































































































































































 Seems the knives are really out in the boardroom. It would be great if there was a source as to the **financial** reasons behind the power struggle. The ideological reasons may be fine, but I'm sure they are not the whole story by far. 












































 Will do. There may be a 'security problem' on their part depending upon where they are presently living. Being as they are Kurds you might want to query 'democratic confederalism' and not just 'anarchism'. 









 The collection comes from 'Mideast Tunes' which features 'progressive' musicians rather than specifically anarchist ones. I'll see if I can dig up anything on the individuals mentioned. 



















 I hope other statements are forthcoming soon. 




 One of the "missing pieces" in the general debate about what Syriza should or shouldn't do is the matter of 'tax dodging' amongst corporations and wealthy individuals in Greece. From what I understand the prevalence of this in Greece is higher than it is even in Italy. I don't have the references in hand, but my understanding is that Syriza's efforts on this issue have been weak at best. The international bankers and other institutions are quite unconcerned with this aspect of the Greek crisis. One might suspect that tightening up is the *last* thing they would want. 





























 Yes, it's sad but predictable. I'm interested in what will happen in terms of the internal disputes within Syriza itself. Also in the actual story behind the story of Varoufakis' resignation. From what I have seen he is reluctant to speak plainly about the disputes that led up to his replacement. Trying to 'reform' a social democratic party is almost always a fruitless quest given the 'coalition' nature of all such parties. Greece differs from other situations only in the speed with which events developed and the importance of the subject of the internal debates.  


































































































































































































 The smoke extends that far ? The fires are mainly in BC and Saskatchewan. That is some distance. When Mount St. Helens blew the atmospheric effects were apparent over a thousand miles away. It's likely you will be seeing blood red suns and not just moons near sunset.
