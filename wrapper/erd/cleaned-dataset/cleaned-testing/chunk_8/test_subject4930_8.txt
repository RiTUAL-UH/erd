 The extra information on the item http://prntscr.com/6ceoms 




 oooooooooo cold. xD 




 i mean it's cheap so you can easily replace it if it does. but i dont own the knife so i cant say. 




 after a very quick search i found it in black. im sure you can find it in silver if you just search "balisong trainer" http://www.amazon.com/Black-Metal-Practice-Trainer-Sheath/dp/B00H977EJW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1420948412 sr=8-1 keywords=balisong+trainer

 Almost everyone over at r/balisongs considers this the best cheap one http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Cool-Metal-Steel-Practice-Balisong-Butterfly-Trainer-Training-Sports-Dull-Tool-/121497151639?pt=UK_Collectable_ToolsHasdware_RL hash=item1c49cb6897 




 Dont get the cheap made in china ones with the aluminum weights! they're awful. Get the made in USA ones with brass weights. 




 YOU WANT A BIG FOLDER, MAGGOT!? http://www.ebay.com/itm/Giant-pocket-knife-Bad-to-the-Bone-Folder-17-inch-nice-gift-free-shipping-USA-/191473160580?pt=Collectible_Knives hash=item2c94b09184 




 I bought it was a collectors piece. I like the way it looks, it's not a nice that will get any use.
 




 Thank you :) i answered Khthonic's question in a  reply to him if you wanna check that out :P 




 thanks man i'll check them out! :) 




 This Knife has Fire Storm pattern Damascus steel blade, made By 1095/15N20 ALLOY STEELS (176 true Layers) Hand forged. Not amazing steels, i'll give you that. 




 well i bought it from www.poshland.co.uk if that helps :) 




 i wanted to see it's chopping power when i first got it... placed a plastic bottle cap on the floor, cut it clean in half.... and my carpet xD
 




 the indented blade is for batoning wood (notice how the top of the blade above it is curved, perfect for hitting with another piece of wood like a club/hammer). where as the curved blade (the belly) is more for your everyday stuff :) 




 actually the model for that is based of this knife https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=mtech+usa+xtreme+mx-8054 espv=2 biw=1680 bih=965 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=kESxVM2aBJDgaM-cgMgE ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg

EDIT: there's also this if you're looking for an irl damascus huntsman. About as close as you can get https://poshland.co.uk/product/tr-p-334-custom-handmade-damascus-steel-tracker-knife-stunning-micarta-handle/ 




 It appears to be made by a company called "Stainless Steel". Hope this helped. 









 woah dude.....wooooooooooah.
