 Power bills in the $10m range. That's per month. With current processor and system architectures a true exaflop capable machine would -literally- require a dedicated nuclear power facility. 




 Your living room would be very well heated.  




 He claims to have done the software legwork but that doesn't appear to be part of the story yet. In fact that is the meatiest thing here--and all C based?  




 Well, at least you can be pretty certain you're using all 8. The risk for so-called dark silicon is something of a topic to consider with these puppies. 














 That's some Grade A hexagonia coral. They are very simple to polish by hand, by the way, although that one will be pocky. Get a tough sanding sponge, then gradually get a finer grain and you'll have a nice shined piece with a few hours of work (I do this when I sometimes watch TV or listen to NPR or just need stress relief). 



















 You will probably using something like a Knights Landing/Knights Corner architecture for AI...It's not quite there yet, very HPC focused. But the days of the discrete GPU for these kinds of things are numbered--having it all on the die this (and OpenPower architectures on the way with NVlink) will make your work great fun--and ultra high performance. 




 couldn't agree more but for the big exascale folks, it's going to boil down to raw performance per watt. That's where this battle will really heat up--at this point no way to tell how differentiated. 




 He is a giant. I believe over 7 feet tall. And one of my favorite writers. It's a shame that's the only comment this brings forth.  









 Yeah, but I'm not a subscriber 









 Weird--I see the whole thing, not sure what the difference is. 



















 Not sure where you found it but it could also be ancient pottery. I found a few similar pieces in the South that looked like wave-formed sandstone (albeit darker) and found it was burnished pottery. 



















 Dear sweet jesus, bacon agate. That just set off sparks in my brain.  




 These are good points. How common are these scenarios though outside of research HPC? 









 Bryozoa 









 I used to make the mistake thinking they were fish fins on finds from the U.P. in northern Michigan--these are abundant there as well. 




 I've never seen anything like the garnet inside the quartz--amazing find! 












































 I hereby coin the phrase "Tampa as fuck." -- Because yes, this is story is Tamp.... yeah. You get it. 




 Wow. That is the most obviously fake thing I've seen in a long time. Bravo! I watched it twice for fun. 




 When you say it like that I want something with guacamole. And I would drive to India to get it right now. 




 He is disturbingly ripped and tan for an old white politician. It just makes this all the more Michael Bay-ey. We need to just stop fucking around and just hire all semi-well-aged post action film career-oriented actors as the symbols of presidential authoritah. 




 On second thought, Team America World Police" 




 This text is ripped right from the script of a Michael Bay film.
 




 And even though it's for zombies and it's silly, when you think about it, the intro/soundtrack at the beginning just keeps splitting into my mind when I watch what's happening. Or building, more accurately. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y26TQKczaaY 




 Another. Because this is what is was made for. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lfInFVPkQs 




 Let me add to this.

I'm showing my old age. But damn. It's starting again. I can feel it. Can you? 









 If everyone is looking for a panic story, they're now in luck. This is the only time I've been worried about Ebola in the US--no story has convinced me that it's anything good sanitization and medical practices couldn't fix. But this...this is actually news. 




 This is a very half-assed news article. What's up with the BBC these days? No context, errors, etc. 




 So very very tired of shallow Hadoop reporting. 




 Or fossilized hexagonia coral (aka "Petoskey Stone") 




 The link there was the press release rehashed. The only real details to be found about the system is here http://www.hpcwire.com/2014/07/10/los-alamos-lead-shares-trinity-feeds-speeds/ 




 This was written by a fifth grader. 




 For now. But they had one four years ago. Then they took the top. Now they have a ton of funding (U.S.'s not there) and now they're building more AND building their own stuff (i.e. not reliant on American tech for their high end computing). It's significant as a trend.
