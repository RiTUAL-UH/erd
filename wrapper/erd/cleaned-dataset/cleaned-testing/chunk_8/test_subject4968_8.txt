 Cocaine. 









 Key plot points are mentioned once, then thrown aside for another three episodes. Did you remember there was a missing girl until yesterdays episode? No, no you didnt. Peoples names are mumbled, and unless you have been making your own police procedural board at home, you have no idea why any of them are important. Each scene is set up in the first two sentences, so if you miss those, you are cast adrift for the next 10 minutes. Youre pausing the TV and turning to your already annoyed other half, saying: Er, so, just to recap  these people are  bad?


Think that was a point alright.
