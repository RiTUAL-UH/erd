 Thank you. 




 This is a really touching read. We all derive fulfillment through helping others. We all need to be needed. We're like gears, our interdependence is what gives our lives meaning. 

I found:

It gave me something to focus on besides my grief and turned me into someone my brother would be proud of.

especially inspiring. I'm really glad to hear you're doing better. Remember that those close to you have the same human need to help others, so don't be afraid to reach out to them. Take good care of yourself.  




 That's a sweet proposal story! I guesstimated my wife's ring size by casually letting her mess around with an old ring I normally wore. When she slipped it on, it seemed to fit perfectly, so I figured "If it fits me, it'll fit her" was a good philosophy for engagement ring shopping. 

Then when I bought the ring it was too big for her. Apparently my own ring was slightly tight on me and slightly loose on her. 

It was ok, because it's always easier to resize a too big ring than a too small ring (plus, a girl will feel embarrassed if her finger is too big to fit into the ring). Unfortunately I hadn't purchased the "re-sizing insurance" thing, so it was extra.  

TLDR: Always buy a slightly too big ring, and re-sizing insurance.   




 Thank you.  




 Yes it's my name (I don't normally give personal information, but I figured first names would be ok because I didn't expect many people to see this). I grew up in the U.S., but my parents are Indian. Take care.
