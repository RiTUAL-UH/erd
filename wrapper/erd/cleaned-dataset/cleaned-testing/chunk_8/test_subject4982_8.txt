 I am currently on POF. I have also labeled myself as "average" body type. I gained some weight when my kate fianc passed away. I have always been in great shape, and I am a very attractive woman. (I have been told by so many people throughout my life. No I do not have a big head.) Figured it would be good to get back into dating online and try things out. Although my body type says "average", I have lost 30+ in a few short months. I still have more to go. But by eating healthy and actually getting out of bed and starting my days makes that much of a difference- I was so depressed for the longest time. I do let the men I talk to know that I am on this journey and if they can accept me now, they will be more accepting when I reach my goal. 

I'm not telling you this to feel bad for me or anything, just sharing so you know not all "fatties" wanted to be that way. And that some of us are making the conscious effort to better ourselves.  




 Some people are so strange.  




 One time my (ex) boyfriend ate me out at a restaurant under the table. It was a really dark restaurant and the table clothes were touching the ground. The waiter came up to the table and realized he was missing said I could order for him if I knew what he wanted. I told her to come back in ten minutes that he left his wallet at home. Honestly that was the best ever and I do not feel guilty about it at all.  




 This has to be the funniest shit I have seen in FOREVER 




 Brandon Novak heroin.  




 That girls hair extensions look lime sheeeeiiiiittttt 




 STFU?! As sick as that is- completely badass. CHEERS.  




 Ohio is 80 




 This makes my heart happy.  




 I love you 




 Prozac saved my social life. My family could deal with my crazy shit but people around me didn't know how...Once I was put on meds, I actually had a true friend. 




 Hey, any time. Went through that recently as well. Roommate burned my kitchen down.  




 Positive vibes your way.  




 I worked at this place called The Barn. It literally is an old red barn from the 20's and opened as a bar in 1934. Anyways, we had a regular (way before my time), whose name is Frank. He passed away about 6-7 years ago. His wife still comes in. He was a huge Captain Morgan drinker and we have his "last bottle" in a shrine/glass box. Frank was know to really dislike rap music so when we had DJ's come in he would flight glasses straight across the bar. Not just push them, as if he was throwing them. When employees, including myself, would be making a burger in the back he would tell us when to flip them. Often I would be checking an I.D of someone's and if they were. underage I would get awalsy a swift tap on on the right shoulder. We knew it was him, never failed to amaze us though. 









 Mean Girls 




 First off I live on the edge of suburbia and corn fields. This girl got so drunk she said that she wanted to drive out to the country and hold a family hostage and torture them. She went into extreme detail about this. The whole time with a huge grin on her face.  




 I own a trailer. Nice one. Newly renovated. Got a roommate. He was struggling with some things had him pay $250 a month in rent. Cheap. Told him no smoking in the house. He got drunk and decided he wanted to make fried chicken. Started the process and then passed out on the couch with a cigarette burning. To my surprise it wasn't the cig that caught my trailer on fire.... He burnt the chicken. Caught my stove on fire and slept threw the whole thing. I work in a bar so I was just getting home around 4 A.M when I saw the paramedics, fire trucks and police officers. He came out unscathed and moved out the. next day. While I had no place to live considering majority of my place was gone. I had to move back home with my parents. Shit sucks. 

He got his karma a few months later- got pulled over for a DUI in someone else's truck with no insurance.

EDIT: I have multiple bad roommate stories. I have always had bad luck in this department. 




 Yeah of course, my cottage is right by there. Scio, Ohio. And I went there for a "religious retreat" (I went to Catholic schools didn't exactly have a choice!) 




 I'm from Sylvania, Ohio! Small world. About 30 mins from Yipsi. 




 What really kills my self esteem is when I'm having a great night at work, no tables have complained and everything is prompt. (Fine dining) And then all of a sudden a cook calls you a cunt in front of all the staff because HE fucked up the timing on the ticket. Broke me down. My tables heard and everything. Real self esteem killer.  




 Very interesting, thank you!  




 And what is the material they are made out of?  




 I always thought the Sorell had a little citrus flavor to them. I used to eat them all the time. Still do!  




 Ya and God forbid I wear actual panties and not a thong and my friends point it out. Jackasses ha 




 I just watched the trailer and I am terrified.
