 This is actually a great story. Not because it's good, and I'm sorry it happened. But...what an exchange. 'Fuck you.' 'Fuck you.'

My aunt was in Chicago and she had her handbag snatched, she chased after him screaming for her passport and, nice of him, he stopped, took it out and threw it for her. He got everything else. But at least she could come home. 




 True. But I don't think to an incredibly vast expense. 

I think too many developers is going to hit the developers hardest, though. Which they should bear in mind. 




 Been writing for ten years. Spent four years writing and editing a novel, got rejected a few dozen times, and then realised it was shit.

Trying to push out some shorts and poems whenever possible.

Working on next novel. About 25k words in. 




 Doesn't matter how many people use Unity or UE, not that many people are going to be able to put out games. 




 Have to say, I agree. These films are excellent.

Skadoosh. 




 Open Office, on the other hand, is absolutely free. And does the exact same thing to the exact same quality. 




 I recommend the Ukulele over the guitar. I've been playing for about two weeks and can play four songs. I've been playing Bass on and off for years, and can only just about play three songs.

Also, the ukulele is just the most fun instrument to play. It's so non-serious, and that's great.

I got my Ukulele for 16 off Amazon, which is nothing. 




 Well spotted. Good game? I do kinda want to buy it. 




 If you're just remember you have just as many oscars as Leonardo Dicaprio.

If that doesn't work, just imagine a T-rex making a bed.

 




 Fuckin' Borderlands 2. Christ - speak about *too* long. 




 Yeah, you need a team. You need a whole team and a flawless strategy. You need to be a better gamer than anyone thought possible. Yeah, that's just for local(ish) tournaments. 




 I think she does bat them off quite quickly by hiding behind the cop's failures, so the FBI don't want to press her too hard. The evidence as it is does add up. But that book was pretty flawed anyway.

She wanted her dead body to wash up on the shore. Great, which would *absolutely* prove that he didn't do it. Fatal flaw in the plan was to not just disappear! Throwing herself off a boat would never have worked. 




 Also, sorry, just popped over to Booksie. That is not a good looking website. It looks strange, it's not as presentable as it could be, and your stories don't feature as prominently as they should.

I would recommend moving over to Wattpad (which is a much more recognised name). Or even Figment. 

(also, you trust a site that let's anyone print off your entire manuscript without any qualms?) 




 Promote harder. Never stop promoting. Find new ways to promote. Build on old ways to promote. Promote yourself, build up your social media presence, keep people coming back for more. Not the material, it's the coverage. Use other writing sites, too. Put up samples, and then link to a single, main account (which seems like Booksie in your case) and drag them in that way.

Also, having things online doesn't stop them being published. Of course, you'll have to take them down. But no one would forgo a piece of writing because it was on the internet. I've seen a lot of people have that concern, and a lot of people have replied, stating their fears are unfounded. Don't worry :) 




 The thing about Patreon is that without an audience who does care, you just come off as a money-grabbing asshole. And you don't want that. As mentioned, build up an audience first. Which can take time but will work in the end. There are people out there who write serial novels on wordpress and make a living out of it.

Come up with a great idea, keep at it, keep the momentum going on wordpress as you build up a decent audience. And then, when you have a fair amount of readers, bam! money please :) 




 The whole point - which is explained in the novel (sorry) - is that she traps him. That, even though her original plan didn't work out, she totally won still. Eventually her 'fake-death', and "rape", were just byproducts of the fact that, eventually, she still has him totally trapped. 




 If you're definitely going to change your story vastly, then making as resolute an outline of the changed version as possible. You want to make the merger as streamlined as possible. It depends if you want this new draft to resemble the original at all, or not. If you do want to, then just write an outline of changes. Otherwise go full draft.

I've never rewritten something from scratch no. I spent three years writing my novel no way I was going to rewrite the damn thing. But I did spend a year editing it.

You have to be aware of the limitations of your novel. You don't want to spend the next two years reworking this, if you would benefit more from moving on to something else. That's what I had to tell myself. After a year of editing, the novel wasn't getting any better, into the drawer with it. It's definitely something worth doing, rewriting the novel. But give yourself a doable time-frame, and don't ever extend it. Stick to it like your life depends on it.  




 I am also fine with this word. I like words that aren't in the dictionary, they're the best. Stabby, that's the word I made up today. I had to describe a sharp stone with certain qualities: stabby. 




 It would be remiss of me not to share my favourite meme of all time.

[I promise, this is the last one](http://imgur.com/RisOcxl) 




 Hard to say. It's probably worth drafting up a secondary version now, and then distancing yourself from both. As you go through your main, written copy, after your month break, you can compare the written events to the secondary events, and get a feel of how it works out in that scene.

That is what you asked isn't it? 




 I like to be at least slightly resourceful when it comes to memes and gifs :) 




 This worked out quite well.

[Just one more gif :)](http://gfycat.com/LikelyHappyAmericanavocet) 




 Those are my two tips for cheering up. The first is that, whenever you're feeling down, always remember you have just as many Oscars as Leonardo DiCaprio. 

The other is the T-Rex thing, perfectly demonstrated in gif form. Which I will cherish forever. 




 Spain. France. Greece. Malta.

If I live in England, I guess Wales and Scotland count.... 




 Here's a gif of a t-rex trying to make a bed someone made for me:

[Clickity](http://i.imgur.com/sKjhQ6G.gif)

They were asking for ideas to cheer up and I said I always imagine a T-rex trying to make a bed. It worked, and they made a gif of it for me. And I thought it was genius. 




 I'm sorry, it was meant to be a joke :( My bad for not making it a very good one. 




 Don't think I'm being too serious. It's common superstition that it's bad luck to talk about Christmas, or sing Christmas songs when it's not Christmas, that's all.   




 Dude, it's like July. I can't imagine the kind of Sin, Bad-Karma, bad-luck/misfortunate you'll get for invoking the name Christmas.

 Because they already have an excuse for elitism: PCmasterrace.

I'm not just bashing on PC. I'd disagree with anyone who blindly proclaims one console over another. It annoys me when people say get a PS4 purely for the graphics. That ain't logic. 

And I know not every single PC player is like that. But I have seen a god awful amount of threads asking about preference towards consoles, and on *every single one* someone pops up and says "PCmasterrace".  




 Because there are different people. 

One is someone who calmly explains the benefits of each system, and why, perhaps, the PC is a better choice, if the asker is so inclined.

Then there are the people who blindly bash away at people who have asked what console to have, spouting mindlessly to get a PC, without any real reason why. The kind of people who don't make cases logically, just blindly declare PC is best for them, and therefore everyone.

Also because, for a post asking about consoles, you have to take a step back and say "Yeah, consoles are great, but have you thought about a PC, here's why..."

They don't do that. If they did that I would be fine with it. It's just when they spout *"Get a PC"*. 




 We want proof that the underdog can beat the man.

"We learned to root for the underdog because we see ourselves in them".

Add in a post-apocalyptic setting and you've got it.

 




 Well, when you put it like that... 




 Obviously as PC gamers they don't have anything interesting to say so they just bash on consoles.  




 Being as it won't be about Joel or Ellie. I doubt it. Trust Druckmann.  




 No, I was saying that shortcuts and roundabouts don't exist. Not that simply writing was a shortcut. The opposite. There is no easy way.

It's funny how all of these workshops and writing schools have popped up at just the right moment to serve the hundreds of people who want to be writers. How did every single writer before the 21st century manage without attending a seminar on writing? 

 




 Fuck, I'm sick of these posts. Not only are there hundreds of them *on this thread alone* there is always the inevitable answer from a goddamn PC-playing elitist telling you to get a PC. 




 Men do not care. We just don't.  




 I just don't tell any of my family I write. My friends aren't readers, or writers, so they don't really care. So I miss out a lot of these steps :) 




 It is commercial, and I know of authors who have recognised that and entered the market for purely financial reasons, but I don't think this is the case for all writers. 

Once something gets popular, say, Twilight, a lot of people try to emulate that success, so we get a market saturated with emo vampires. Now Meyer, who is the most successful, isn't to blame here (except for Breaking Dawn). The original trilogy was fine, and she, as a previous author, wasn't just writing for the money (except Breaking Dawn). Those that came after her, copying her, did. 

Otherwise, you are perfectly correct. 




 I think that a lot of trilogies are born from an original thought: What if kids were made to fight in an arena to the death? What if kids were made to run a maze for [twist, twist, twist] reasons. What if there was a society of people who had surgery to make them beautiful at 16? 

All of these taglines on their own are pretty awesome. And they stand up as solid novels. But the tagline doesn't extend to the sequels. So they has in a sub-plut (post-apocalypse - evil government, post-apocalypse - evil government, post-apocalypse - evil government)+ and that's how it plays out for the rest of the sequels

+I didn't choose all three of us because they embodied those theme. I chose them because I have read them all, they just so happen to have the same *freaking* antagonist!  




 Inception! 




 Structure is sitting down every day at a certain time and writing. 

This is a craft, it's art. There is no shortcut to getting better, no trick or roundabout way. There is only one: to write. Everything else is...arbitrary. Except reading. 

Look up what everybody's advice is about how to get better at writing. It's not to enhance your vocabulary (which is a side-effect of reading widely and reading well), it's not to read as many 'how-to-write' books as possible (9/10 of which are BS scams anyway). It's to read and to write. That's it.

You want a goal? 500 words a day. If you can put in more time, go for higher. I try and write a thousand. If I'm feeling good, I can pump that out in an hour. Then I move onto my scripts, or writing my games. If I do all that - back to my novel.

You might benefit more from books on writing than I do, I've always found them a waste of time; purely because I could be writing instead. 




 The technique and ideas for editing have already been pretty thoroughly laid out by others, so here's my two cents.

Traditional publishing and self-publishing are nothing even remotely alike. Don't throw yourself at one or the other. Research and research and research thoroughly. Written accounts, agents accounts, testimonials. Everything, for both sides.

As it stands you have to have a super duper amount of faith in the project to pay someone to work on it. 

Even more pertinent: you don't have to worry about any of this until the book is finished. Nothing else matters till then. 

Good luck :) 




 Back in my day, haha. What an expression. 




 Knowing all the words, and being intimate with all the fiction in the world, won't make you a better writer. Only writing will. 

Your plan should read more like:

* 7 Days writing
* Read in the evenings
* Submit through the evenings. 




 No point on lingering on it. Our fears didn't come true. Everything is far happier returning to how things were, than lamenting on how things could have been. 




 Ask her friends. :) 




 A lot of companies publish all their financial statistics, you just have to rummage around their website long enough to find the boring part. A lot of companies are owned by others, so it's worth finding out who their parent company is first.  




 "wroters?"

Typo, or...?

There are websites for writing, where you can upload your writing and others can read it. But a lot of these also include forums for various things. Check out Figment and Wattpad. 




 Speedrunners. So much speedrunners.

Also Team Fortress 2.

 




 Everything you're going to try and do will be to improve it. It's going to change a lot of in editing either way.

I think the best thing to do would be to summarise the plot in bullet points, and then create a list of events that you would change, and then see which one you prefer, which you hate. Once you can see an overview of the new canvas you might see how much you like, or dislike, the new version. 

If it changes that's fine, so long as all the changes are for the best. Of course at this stage it might be good seeking other people's opinions, because if you're unsure how to move forward on your own it's always worth just getting a second opinion :) 




 It needs to attach itself to Parker. All of it's traits are from him. That's the reason he so resembles a spider, why he can do something that resembles web-slinging, and wall-crawling. 




 My first long-term relationship.

But hey, it first-time relationships aren't for fucking up I don't know what they're for.

Note to self: Find someone who actually gives even a slight shit about your life-goal. 




 More than like haha. It has quickly gone on to my list of all time favourite things ever. 




 Just what I need, another depressing song.


-Merrily plods off to listen to the song- 




 [sent later than it should have been due to there being too much laughter to type.] 

Yea, I needed that. That was amazing. 




 That's not a bad idea. 




 It wasn't bad, by any stretch. I just found the first half of her life more interesting than the second. Which isn't a reflection on Gainsbourg, because I think she's great. Just that portion of her life was more interesting than when she joined up with that guy and just started torturing people.  




 That's what I thought. You've had lots of practice. 




 Would you be interested in starring in my screenplay, Mr. Cruise? It's about a guy who has to run away from things. I feel like you would be the best person for the job. 




 There is a cost, that's why I have to ask.

I'm a writer. I'm writing a novel, and I'm working hard on it. I'm writing a short film, and I'm writing for some indie game developers as well. I'm doing everything I've always wanted to.

But I got made redundant, about two months ago. 

I have enough money saved to keep me going for a few months longer, if I'm careful with it. But it won't last forever.

So my question is; should I continue doing what I'm doing, and pushing myself to fulfill my dream? Or should I get a job? 




 First half was better than the second, imo. Both were excellent. I'm not sure how this compared to the other two. It just seemed a bit more windy, and fell off track more than the others and you really feel it at moments, particularly the second half. 




 Yeah, I'm doing that. The same old song. And that's the one put me in the rut in the first place, it's certainly not helping. 




 But it only comes in the evening... 




 Nice try ;) 




 Too damn right. Wish I could do that. 




 You listen to [one sad song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgmgfDWfOd4), and suddenly you can't shake the irksome feeling of loneliness and inadequacy.

Know what I mean CC? 




 The best time's I had with my friends were on Halo/Halo Wars online. (We used to kick so much ass one Halo Wars, were unstoppable). Me and a friend got super-amazing at SSB on the gamecube, and later the Wii, to the point where we were so matched out fights would last half-an-hour. But other than that, it was all online regardless. 

And Nintendo still do that. Most of their games (Mario Kart, SSB) cater to a couch co-op market. 

I don't think I miss sitting at my friends house drinking cheap beer we had nicked from our parents, I miss that time of my life in general. The gaming has little to do it. 

And I think if I were to say what I missed specifically it would be the nostalgia speaking. There was nothing explicitly amazing about gaming except how I approached it as a young child new to it all. 

I would have liked to have seen games be introduced, and be influenced and been a part of the industry at the time when it was new, and they were just setting the rules. 




 Whenever I'm down I just remind myself that I have exactly the same amount of Oscar's as Leonardo Di'caprio. 


If that doesn't work, I just imagine a T-Rex trying to make a bed. 




 CGP Grey - surprisingly fascinating videos. 




 [Andromeda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udAL48P5NJU)

This is a compilation of images taken with the Hubble telescope, and gives us the most in depth image of Andromeda ever. The image doesn't just do it justice so I've linked a youtube video.

The video selects a portion of Andromeda, somewhat on the fringes and zooms in. And the image just keeps getting noisier and grainier and it keeps happening, and thousands of dots just keep appearing and appearing. And then you reach a moment where the noise falls apart and you realise that all those tiny pixels you mistook for grains...are fucking stars. 

[Also this heartbreaking image, and the story behind it is a really fascinating. Worth looking into, and about the photographer as well.](https://iconicphotos.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/kevin-carter-vulture.jpg?w=700 h=466)

[Also, this guy is a goddamn genius. Linked to his whole website because I couldn't pick a favourite. They're all amazing](http://www.joshuahoffine.com/#/horrordashasdashmetaphor/6) 




 Missed out on?

Gaming is as good as it's ever been. It's at its peak, better than ever. We have different platforms to purchase games. Making games has become so much easier, leading to an incredible rise in the Indie gaming market, which has given us some of the best games ever made, and allowed hundreds to pursue dreams they otherwise might have to have given up on. I can whip out my phone and play a game any time. And I can do it for free. 

The technology is incredible, everything that gaming has to offer is mindblowing. Games are being incorporated into education and healthcare. The console and gaming market is a thriving economy that employs thousands of people globally, and reaches thousands more to give them an outlet of entertainment that can't compare to even a decade ago.

Narrative, and characterisation, alongside fleshed out gameplay have come to a head and that's amazing. 

I honestly wouldn't wish for anything else. 

 




 First of all, before you separate yourself from your novel for a month, here's what I recommend. Read through it now, and just correct any grammatical mistakes, typo's, just all the little things. While the novel is still fresh in your head. You'll be thanking your old self in a months time after spending so long away from it.

The thing is your first draft is meant to be malleable. The editing stage is the point where the book *changes*. You have to sit back and look and decide what serves the story best. It might turn out that involves changing a whole lot, but hey, your story doesn't deserve any less.

It might take a lot of time to do, so it depends how much time you want to put into it. I spent a year editing my novel for nothing to happen with it. You just gotta do it. Don't hesitate because it's a big undertaking, or because your attached to your work. Gut that manuscript till it's bloodless. It's a hard thing to do, but it absolutely must be done. 

Best advice I found when to stop editing? When you find yourself changing things back to what they were originally, stop. You just gotta see what's best for the story. And if you change it only to discover it was better as it was before, now you know. Just change it back, and then leave it for good.



 




 Was about to pop on and recommend this. First comment. I like it =] 




 Only chance I'm going to get to fly. I get lucid dreams so rarely and I never have full control. I can only tip the current dream I'm having in a favourable direction. If I try and take full control it wakes me up. 




 Probably Lilo   Stitch. I love the Lion King, and I love Disney but I have this little point inside of me that remembered hating all the Disney movies for no reason other than because I was a young boy, so there's a little residue from that.

Also, just want to point out the *vast* distinction that has to be made between Pixar and Disney. They are not the same thing. Pixar are incredible, Disney are not. 

Not a shot at the OP, but Inside Out is *not* a Disney movie.

 




 Ask them to fix it. It's what they ought to have done in the first place, explain your position, I'm sure they'll understand. 




 Interestingly enough, I live England, and we do not celebrate at all. 




 When I tell you don't you don't think of an elephant, what's the first thing that pops into your head?

Elephants.


In this instance, Elephant is me googling an animal's penis. 




 Pphh. You don't avoid boredom. You goddamn embrace it and power through it.  




 I like the solitude. It's the one time I'm away from a TV or laptop for any length of time. It's just headphones in and being left alone with nothing but your thoughts for an elongated amount of time. 




 Probably knowing what you're going to do, and what your channel is going to be about helps. That decision should certainly come before contemplating the how of making a video.

Also, production values. Do not underestimate production values. Lights, and a good camera. 




 Been there! 




 Hit me with the most random fact you know off the top of your head. If you have to google it, you're cheating.

Keyboards were actually invented to make the user type as *slow* as possible. That's why they're so random. On typewriters, if the user typed too fast the machine would jam. So keys were placed in non-alphabetical order, and as random as possible to slow us down. Then we just got used to them, and they never changed. 









 What's wrong with Summer Reads? 









 Dragon Age: Inquisition had a decent system like this. Very similar to how AC did it, but a bit better. Unfortunately the rest of the game is meh. 




 I saw the film first, when I was quite young. I still think it's a really good film. That certainly hindered my expectations of the book. A few years later I would read American Gods and within a few weeks I would go through the rest of his bibliography.  




 I thought it was kinda genius. De Niro was actually brilliant in the part.  




 Late reply sorry. I think it is quite good yes. Definitely vastly superior to Twilight. It might take a little while to get into, it's written like that, but after that it's good. 




 It does feel like a compiled book of short stories, especially the way it jumps between characters and their events. But, still, if you're interested in Middle-Earth, it's fascinating. 




 But only what they're allowed to know. That's it. Don't forget they're heavily brainwashed to be very disgusted by the idea of parenthood, and anything natural. 




 Stardust. Because the book doesn't have Robert De Niro as a cross-dressing sky-pirate. :) 




 No. The alpha's wouldn't be the people who look after the livestock, they would have no interaction with anything that bred. 

Furthermore, there brainwashing would have nothing to say about it. They wouldn't know. Perhaps the lower castes would be brainwashed in a certain manner so they could breed, but not the alphas.  




 Iyam! And thanks :)

Short link to the vlog for you :)  




 I don't doubt for a second I can get round to all of those :) 

As for 1984, I absolutely loved that book so why not. 




 Not likely. That was a hearken back to the olde days of...2005/6. Not recently. 




 You can follow my brand-new vlog where I'll eventually talk about it. I don't want to plug too obviously so I'll wait to see if you're interested before linking. 




 My sister was a prolific Myspace'r. I guess, in her own humble way, she was myspace famous. Which was *the shit* back in the day. So I guess that's the only reason I got into Myspace. 




 Back in the old days before Facebook. Rush home from school so you could talk to your mates on MSN. And, of course, make sure your *myspace* page was top-notch. 




 I do, but I'm keeping a lid on it for now m'afraid. 




 Yeah I realised my mistake as soon as I made it. Having to make superscript isn't something I often have to do on Reddit. This ( ^ ^ ) is left over my old MSN days. That's how long I've known about it. 









 Did I miss out the other eye? I meant

^ ^

=D 




 I'm exactly the same! I've only just settled down into a nice routine of living my entire life on Reddit. I like this arrangement! 




 :O Thanks ^^  









 Malevolent spirits. And how my two protagonists deal with them at three different stages in their lives. 




 That's enough internet for today. 




 I'm working on my novel. And I also got a new job writing a short-film for a local film-maker, so that's awesome. Especially when I said I'd work for free and he said he'd pay me so...I'm pretty happy with that :)
