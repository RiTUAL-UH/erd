  reddit can then devolve into the mismanaged, juvenile slapfight it was supposed to be.

*Then?* We're already *there* and have been for a while now.  




  What doesn't make sense to me is why Ellen and or the admins don't talk to the community

Because we're the peasants and they're better than us so why do they care what the average user of this site thinks? That's how they think.

 




  you people are jumping with joy that this happened so you can, in your minds, prove a point.

They're proving our points for us. We don't need to do anything. This is the umpteenth story about a non-citizen, illegal criminal alien coming into this country and killing someone because of Obama's open borders policy. Bush opened the border up as well though not to such an extent as Obama. The GOP sells out real Americans so that their fat cat donors can get cheap labor while the Dems sell us out so that they can get a giant new voting bloc straight outta Mexico and Central America. Who stands up for real Americans?

Bet reddit never read or heard about that. Just one of many stories. 




  Could someone explain why it's a good idea to not deport people who are in a country illegally?

Because Obama and the Democratic Party want America to turn into Brazil or South Africa demographically so that they never lose another election. Obama is going to amnesty all 11 million + illegal immigrants in this country so that he can ensure that he and the Dems run the country in the future without the GOP standing a chance. It's just racial mob rule democracy that the Founding Fathers never wanted in this country. Dems and Obama don't care. They're done courting the white vote so they're importing as many non-whites as they can who are lower class so that they vote for the party that gives them government benefits.  




  step down as CEO.

Nope. Her life is on the line, not just her career. No one has a full financial audit/report on her and her husband but the word on the street is that they are bankrupt so she needs this job. If she loses this job somehow then I think that she is done for good in Silicon Valley and possibly elsewhere.  




 I doubt that she will. I'll bet that when she signed her contract to work for reddit she signed a non-disclosure agreement or something of that nature which prohibits her from discussing her firing.  




 The funniest thing happening right now is that 4chan's /pol/ board has totally taken over /r/TimAndEric  which has 20k subscribers and it is being spammed with all things /pol/.
 




 Can you link me to the post or comment that you made about this that got you banned? I really want to read this and have it on hand for future reference. Thanks in advance.

 This is like War Games between the reddit admin hierarchy and the power mods.

     Shall we play a game? 

     Love to. How about global thermonuclear reddit war?

     Wouldn't you prefer a good game of chess?

 If you say so. I'm not a part of the reddit mod hierarchy so I'm not privy to such backroom dealings and discussions.  




 /r/AskReddit is private. Interesting since krispykrackers is an admin and is the highest ranking active mod of that sub. I think that the creator of AskReddit is qgyh2 or some other inactive mod so krispykrackers is the highest in command. I wonder what's going on in that mod mail right now. karmanaut is the fourth highest mod on the list there so my guess is that he shut the sub down. krispykrackers is the only admin/mod of that sub so she is in a bit of a pickle right now because karmanaut obviously wanted the sub shut down, other mods may have gone along with it, yet these mods don't work for reddit like krispykrackers does. I wonder if Ellen Pao and the other reddit admins or employees will put pressure on krispy to take control of the situation, the subreddit, and of karmanaut.

  The truth is, Roberts is the same fool that believes racism doesn't exist anymore.

No, he just doesn't believe that racism is as virulent and institutionalized as it once was. He doesn't believe that there is no racism. He believes that things like affirmative action are outdated and he is right. Soon, the SCOTUS will be examining an affirmative action case involving a white female applicant to a university that rejected her and admitted a less-qualified black applicant to their university solely due to race. In my opinion, affirmative action policies are racist in and of themselves because they always tend to discriminate against someone due to their race in order to "not discriminate" against someone of another race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. 

How is it fair that qualified individuals like this young woman are denied opportunities that they earned so that people who aren't qualified can be made happy? It's total nonsense.

We see the same thing with Asians in Ivy League schools like Harvard who discriminate against them by rejecting them and accepting typically blacks and Hispanics solely due to race and for no other reason. They say "we have a holistic admissions process" which is a bullshit way of saying that "we drink the diversity Kool-Aid even though we can't demonstrate that it benefits any of our students to admit less-qualified college applicants who happen to be non-Asian minorities."

 Are you a girl if you're transgender? I thought that you can be a girl if you're transsexual since you've taken hormones and other treatments to change your body. Transgender people are just one sex but feel like they're another gender so a boy who feels like a girl who consequently dresses like and/or behaves in a feminine manner. Am I wrong here? Can you be a female when you have a penis but feel like and say to others that you are a girl? Sorry, I'm not well-versed in this trans stuff but I'm curious.

 - Blink-182 and other pop-punk bands. If there was a soundtrack to my childhood then it was filled with Blink-182 songs along with other pop-punk bands like Yellowcard, Green Day, The Offspring, Sum 41, etc. Any time that I hear songs from these bands on the radio or anywhere else I am transported back to my childhood and remember days of running around our neighborhoods playing Cops and Robbers or of days in the Summer spent riding all over town on our bikes or attempting to skateboard in each other's driveways. 

- Skateboarding and skateboard fads. Me and my friends were posers but I still loved the Tony Hawk Pro Skater games and wearing all of the crap that I bought at PacSun with my friends. Billabong/Quicksilver shirts with skate shoes, cargo shorts, and a rope or pukka necklace was a must back in those days. 

- Recess. So much fun. We and my friends used to play soccer, kickball, basketball, football, or we used to chase the girls around and they would do the same with us. This was the age of cooties so being able to outrun the fairer sex was essential to your survival. Nobody wanted to be a member of the male herd to be culled by a superior female specimen who was capable of running you down and infecting you with her cooties with the touch of a finger. 


- Playing video games with friends. Countless nights we would spend over each other's houses playing Playstation, N64, Gameboy, GameCube, XBOX, etc., until we were called home by our parents or we fell asleep. GoldenEye sessions that lasted hours. Pokemon playing on Gameboy that lasted hours. We would play the game and would also trade cards with each other during breaks. TJ is still on my shit list for putting a crease in my holographic Zapdos. Bastard. 

- Field trips at school. I was lucky enough to go on plenty of field trips growing up to a number of different places. Me and my classmates went to art museums, the aquarium, the movies, to theme parks, to giant outdoor arboretums and gardens, to wildlife parks, musical concerts, and more. I always looked forward to these because I got to hang out with my friends outside of class and because it gave me a chance of sitting next to girls I liked on the bus on the way to and from the places that we went to. I'll never forget getting to sit next to and talk to Dana on the bus and then during our trip to the art museum out in the countryside in middle school. I can remember that whole day. It was like heaven for me at that age. I barely knew Dana but she was really pretty and nice and we were split up into the same group and walked around with each other the whole day and then talked and played trivia games with our friends at the back of the bus, you know, where all the cool kids sat. I used to listen to a lot of the songs on my NOW compilation CDs and think about Dana. I remember listening to LFO songs all the time while thinking of her. I guess you could say that things got pretty serious. 

- Watching cartoons. It's strange to think about just how big a part of life cartoons were and then how they were gone when I got older. I haven't watched a cartoon since I was 14 yet I watched them relentlessly for years. Hey Arnold!, Doug, Angry Beavers, Pokemon, Rugrats, Dragonball-Z, etc., all long gone and out of my life despite being such a big part of growing up. It's bittersweet to try and watch some of the episodes again only to realize that you've seriously outgrown the shows and that they no longer are as captivating as they were many years ago when you were a kid. 

- Spending time with friends. We used to be together all of the time during the school year but it was the Summer months that were magical for me and my friends. We would honestly spend just about every waking minute with each other. We would wake up, all go to the pool, spend hours there until dinner time, usually head to each other's houses for dinner, then play outside at night or in each other's basements all night and sleepover each other's houses. We would repeat this routine almost every day of the week. I loved some of the games that we would come up with when we got bored of established games like basketball or whiffle ball. One of my favorites was called "Santa Clause" where one of us had to put on this giant Santa hat over our heads and then come down my friend's basement in the dark where we couldn't see anything. The other guys were down there and had constructed all of these obstacles or boobie traps to screw up the poor friend who had the hat over their head. The way to win was for you to be the last friend hiding who didn't get touched by the guy in the Santa hat. You could hide or beat the crap out of "Santa" with pillows. Many times it was our hysterical laughter that gave away where we were and Santa would lunge at us as and tag us as soon as we gave away our position. Riding bikes, playing tag, swimming at the pool, playing sports, video games, watching movies, watching MTV music videos, and doing other fun stuff with my friends is something I hope that I never forget because those were some of the best days of my life. We were totally carefree, life was so much more innocent and interesting, and it was so much easier to have fun back then. No drama, no egos, no responsibilities. We were all just friends and as we got older things would change and some of us would change and it was bittersweet to lose some friends who you spent the best days of your life with, only to then make new friends who you would make new memories with later. 




 There are dildos and dildon'ts in life. This kid committed a dildon't.

So did another one bite the dust or no? I'm confused. 




 The best part about them sucking Bronn's cock is that they can't speak and we can't hear them when doing it.  




 lol funniest comment so far in this sub. Yes, the mainstream media has totally *pivoted* from the fact that a White supremacist killed some blacks. Yes, our totally right wing media managed to pull one over on everyone by *pivoting* and making it all about the flag. lol wow dude. It totally wasn't the Left in this country and SJWs and black lives matter protesters who made it about systemic racism and the legacy of slavery and the Confederacy. It was totes the GOP or the media pulling our eyes away from the racial killing and towards the flag. 

No one pulled anyone's eyes away from the killer. Are you even joking? 

I would love for you to show me statistics about just how prevalent the beliefs of White supremacy are in our modern day GOP. Y'know, the GOP whose leaders don't even stand up to Obama when he tries to get 11 million illegal Hispanic immigrants amnesty in this country. McConnell and Boehner did nothing to stop him yet White supremacy is enough of a part of the GOP base that cosmic forces needed to *pivot* away from their "involvement" in the GOP. Funny stuff.
