 Julianne Moore in Don Jon. Wtf? 














 Subscribed. 









 How did you give him a concussion?

I would love to hear details :)

 What's the one that looks like it has a web over it? 




 A completely different Mad Max sequel.  




 I guess we will be seeing a sequel. Bring it on.

Although I hope Miller does something completely different. 














 I think they can pull it off. 




 For future reference, Channing Tatum is not listed as part of the cast anymore for Tarantino's the Hateful Eight. He was a few months ago but his name has been removed from IMBD and Wikipedia.  




 Pulp Fiction. 




 Forrest Gump. 




 Jake Gyllenhaal. 




 Cinematographer? 




 That is strange. I just looked on wikipedia and his name isn't there anymore as well. 
























 I tweeted the founder of bloodydisgusting.com he said they are seeking a new director, news by july hopefully. 









 Maybe I've mixed up iffy writing with iffy line delivery. Some of the lines just feel a little ham-fisted at times.  




 What is his twitter? 




 The writing can be a bit iffy sometimes but overall I think it's a great western-drama. It's one of those films where the supporting actor is way better than the lead. Casey Affleck in this film is something to behold, his acting was far ahead of Brad Pitt's, and that doesn't happen very often. 

What are your thoughts? 




 It's from MTV's reboot show. It looks like a mannequin about to perform fellatio. 









 It's for iOS guys.... 




 Does anyone know if there will be any vehicles in F4?  I saw the flying heli-carrier type thing in the trailer, I'm not sure if that counts as a useable vehicle. So yeah is does anyone know?

Edit: I don't them as /u/Herdnerfer mentioned.  




 Did I just....fucking read that right? 

Leo DiCaprio and M...Michael....Bay....teaming up...

Well, in that case, [I'm fucking out of here, cya'll later!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/lftoff.gif)

Edit: I know that Leo is not starring nor Bay directing, this still comes as a shock. 




 That is quite a nice poster.

This is guaranteed to get nominated for some Oscars. 




 Except that poster is creepy... 




 All good, thank you anyway! 




 All good, thank you anyway! 




 Love if someone could take me on a step by step guide on how to jailbreak my iPod 5th Gen. Also if they could tell me what the risks and benefits are.

This would be greatly appreciated :)

iOS: 8.2 (Haven't updated to new one yet) 




 I found a thread for Apple users.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/22kn5p/trying_to_make_my_iphone_into_a_pipboy/ 









 It's kind of a funny story? 




 Yep, I'm done here.

Go fuck yourself reddit. 




 Girl interrupted perhaps?  




 Holy shit that sounds creepy as fuck. Imma go look for it! 




 Fallout 4, M:I 5, Everest, Macbeth, Cartel Land. Oscar season is certainly heating up. (excluding Fallout 4 of course.) 




 So many trailers right now!

Honestly though, this looks fucking insane! 









 So many trailers lately! I love it! 




 Fallout is not about the graphics. If you ask me, giving a Fallout game Battlefront 3 graphics will just ultimately ruin the experience. 




 Thank you The Social Network. Thank you thank you. 




 Decade defining films. For example, for the 1970s your choice could be Apocalypse Now, 80s it could be Terminator etc, etc.

Also, what film do you think defines this current decade? 




 There's absolutely nothing like this for Apple? 




 I just downloaded the one from the website :/

Thank you for this. 




 I pretty sure every gamer on the internet has lol. 









 I hope this tops Ghost Protocol. 

 









 Front page of r/movies 














 I think that all the time ahaha. I see something really neat, and I think, they'll all be gone in a couple of months. I saw some Jurassic Park posters the other day, they'll disappear soon. 




 Wireless Keyboard. I haven't read that one, any good? 




 Pennywise is a monster. Although I see what you mean.  




  Bah.

*What?* Hahahaha. 




 Where!? 




 You have no idea what you've conjured. You should probably delete this, before [they](https://www.reddit.com/r/moviescirclejerk) find this. 




 The guy at the top left:

".......FUCK" 









 /r/rekt 



















 This isn't Fincher... 




 That looks pretty intriguing. 

Although it'll probably end with the wife jamming the baby down the toaster or some crazy shit. 




 Amy Pascal and Scott Rudin are up there, along with Kevin Feige. 

But for most powerful I would have to say Harvey Weinstien. 




 wow! listen, I would like to become a cinematographer. I was wondering, could you help me out? 




 What are you expecting? What do you want to see in this season? 




 Now I know someone is guaranteed to comment Every Fram a Painting, I already know and love that channel. 

But yeah any channels that look at/analyze cinematography in film would be greatly appreciated. 




 Why can't all action films be like this?

Fuck shaky cam. 









 Damn, knew I forgot one. 









 Opening scene to Zodiac stays with me every time I watch it.

Opening to The Social Network is brilliant.

Drive. 

Apocalypse Now of course.

The Godfather (Duh)

The Dark Knight

Heat.

The Town.

Schindler's List.

Saving Private Ryan.

Inception.

Pulp Fiction

Inglorious Basterds

Watchmen

Zombieland. 




 **City of God**

Knew nothing about it, completely blew me away.  














 It fits perfectly.  



















 Yeah sure. 




 *Insight 




 Such bullshit :/ 




 Details in description: http://redd.it/37x1ty 




 Are you aware of the IT remake? 









 Driving.

Kill Billing.



 




 Now that would be wicked. 




 As you can all see I am no writer. Within the DCCU, we have Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and Justice League Parts 1   2 all staring Ben Affleck as Batman. DC have also announced that they are making a single stand alone Batman film JUST about Batman (obviously there will be supporting characters within) whereas Suicide Squad, Justice League and BvS are all feature Affleck's Batman as a supporting character.

In this discussion I just wanted to ask everyone what they would like to see in this stand alone Batman film, what villains they would like to see etc. 




 I'm getting a serious 'Blood Diamond' vibe from this. 




 They've launched a new universe with Ben Affleck as Batman. The Dark Knight Trilogy were their own thing. But yeah this new universe is more true to the comics. So they've got a whole new cast for DC characters. These include Henry Cavill as Superman, Jared Leto as the Joker, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn etc. 




 What are your thoughts on the standalone batman film DC are yet to make? What kind of film would you like to see with what villains etc? 




 squeal like anime school girls.

O_O 




 When you've seen all of them... 









 Collections aren't allowed :/ 









 Aha I know right. 









 When Deakins was announced to lense BR sequel my life automatically completed itself.  




 Any insult from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSEYXWmEse8) video, a youtube classic. 




 That does count. 









 Maybe. If Scorsese ever returns to the gangster genre one last time, it is quite possible. 

Black Mass and Legend both look like promising gangster films.

 




 Please include the name of the film and the cinematographer.

Please one still per user.

I'll announce the winner one week from now, so that gives everyone plenty of time to decide and post.

The still can be from any film whatsoever. Think long and hard about what still you want to post, remember it has to be truly breathtaking on both a technical and storytelling level!

If you have any further questions, please comment or PM me.

Good luck and think hard!

Edit: This submissions just keep getting better and better! I'll give you guys a hint: I'm a BIG fan of Roger Deakins...


Edit: And the winner is...../u/gundamgirl for [this](http://i.imgur.com/XqK5GLj.jpg) shot from THE FALL. Thank you for all of your awesome submissions, It was extremely hard to choose! 

(sorry for the late announcement guys, I could've sworn I posted this on a wednesday...) 




 We have much in common, my friend. 




 What are they and what are you expecting? 




 Hey David! Kung Fury is a spectacular piece of work, I love it!

My question is, what was the biggest challenge about making Kung Fury. 




 You got to...work with....Deakins? 














 Brilliance. 




 /r/TrueFilm will help you out more and in much greater detail.  




 Now THAT is one of the most fucked up things on the internet. 




 Fucked up. 




 **WATCH IT** 




 Sweet, just picked up Chinatown on bluray. Will watch soon. 




 Both of those are hilarious. Especially Tropic Thunder.

*"A nutless monkey could do your job"* 




 Well worth your time. 









 I have immense respect for trauma dogs. Or any kind of animal that can help people. 




 The Graduate.  




 That order exactly. District 9 is amazing. 




 That order except 2001 last.
