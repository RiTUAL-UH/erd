 Who hasn't been there before?  




 Jackson is Bucky's closer 









 I am currently student teaching and had a really shit day today. This quote genuinely bettered my day. Push on indeed President Coolidge.

 There is no chance they keep Freeman, with or without Norv. They will keep Cassel as a vet, if anyone, and draft qb in 1st or 2nd. 




 No longer spies, find cocaine. Now drug cartel. 




 The title didn't tip you off on the swap? 




 I imagine the equivalent of the Amsterdam coffee shops will begin opening up at some point. Seems only logical, no? 




 No offense, but your comment comes off as ignorant as shit. I assume you are white? You clearly don't understand the unequal job opportunities of African Americans in ANY profession, let alone head coaching in the NFL. How many black head coaches were there prior to this rule?? It clearly is working as they are now actually seeing opportunities. It's not forcing any team to hire these individuals. Its forcing teams to actually give them a look. 

Its not like you can just "get rid of the Rooney Rule."  Racism isn't dead, and old white owners usually need to be pushed in the right direction. Sorry, for this mini-rant, it just really pisses me off when people are ignorant of the incredible struggle for equality that is still being fought for by African American coaches. 




 Maybe pick up something from Milwaukee Brewing Company. Local, very city orientated. Or hit up Great Lakes Distillery for some great local booze that may not be available up in Appleton.  




 Understandable. They are quick reads. The dunk and eggs are only 50-70 pages 




 If you still are feeling the itch, there is also the Dunk and Egg novellas as well as The Princess and the Queen. All in the Westeros world. Fantastic reads.
