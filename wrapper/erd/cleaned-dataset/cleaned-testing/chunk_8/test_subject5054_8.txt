 Does smith like rondo more than howard? 




 McDonalds double hamburgers when I need some pick me up calories. Decent enough. At chipolte double chicken bowl, extra black beans, easy on the rice + grilled veggies and salsa and side of guac = macro heaven.  




 I didn't hate it, especially because we had fun teams who were easy to root for (except Kevin Martin).  




 It doesn't work like that. You can't trade for a player just to flip him. Pretty sure he's locked in till after the season or for a year.  




 Holy shit you're obnoxious. Do yourself a favor and re-read all your replies tomorrow when you get a chance to cool off a little.  




 Found the nerd.  




 That's what I immediatly heard.  




 Haha I wanted a z4 for like 10 years after watching it. 




 Yeah I was also not into Wondrous that much. Liked Mute and that's about it.  




 That's one of my favorites as well. I really liked Dalton as Bond. Him and Craig portray/ed a fairly similar Bond.

Golden Eye is probably my favorite though because it was the first one I saw and I got to see it in theaters as a 7 year old. Still remember my dad jokingly covering my eyes during the sexual scenes with Xenia.  




 What did you think of Youth Lagoon? I credit 'The Year of Hibernation' as the catalyst for a lot of the good things that have happened in my life over the past 2 years. I was, almost exclusively, spurred into going to Outside Lands in San Francisco last August to see YL. I thought the show was great (as was the whole festival) and that trip ended up leading to an amazing group of friends, a deconstruction of my previously self-destructive social/general anxiety, and lots of fun in between.

*We were all having fun.*  




 Was kind of disappointed in this version. I like the pace of that live performance a lot more and think it fits better with the song/lyrics. 




 Saw them a few weeks ago in Houston. Good stuff. 









 I bet you can.  




 Not that it does but that could mean that a movie with 99% on RT with 100 reviews could have 99 who think it's the best movie ever and one who doesn't like it and a movie with 100% could have 100 reviewers who just liked it enough to give a positive review.  




 I'm pretty sure that's not Jeff (the guy behind the costume). Unless he's changed A LOT since I talked to him at the end of last season.  




 That's not Clutch. Jeff is way skinnier than that guy.  




 Earlier you said you were a practicing cat psychic though.  




 It's actually the same size as it would be at any distance.  




 Talking about the distance at which you saw it.  




 If you're *sure* it was hunting something else, why did you say it was hunting/stalking yall? Could have had a prett freaking great story but You had to go and get self conscious and sensationalize the events in question.  




 These are shit.  




 You also described it as 'big and scary', which would not be the case at a quarter mile.  




 He noticed a mountain lion stalking Yall at 1300 feet? Worst mountain lion ever or is your uncle the greatest Hunter ever or are you the biggest exaggerator ever of all time times a billion quadrillion? 




 something like 1/4 mile away

You realize that's like 1300 feet, right? You wouldn't know a mountain lion was 130 feet away, let alone 1300.  




 shoot. thanks. 




 It's December, right? 




 The definition of 'beast' is "an animal, especially a large or dangerous four footed one". 




 This is true but we did have Steve Novak. 




 Cool. Guess I'm just a boring person. Enjoy being a fun person.  




 Why are they 4 and 10 respectively? Just curious why he would be ranked higher when they are on the floor together. 




 San Antonio has fields. Cool. Sorry for finding the city boring. I'm sure a lot of people find Houston boring. I don't take it personally. 




 to the flash point a few months ago when a white hispanic guy on neighborhood watch shot an unarmed black teenager he thought was scary.

that was actually 2 years ago

not to discredit the rest of your post or anything. 




 I "hate" San Antonio because it's boring as fuck and hating other big cities in Texas comes with the territory of living in a big city in Texas. San Antonio has 50% hispanic population verse 43% in Houston so there are a lot more Mexicans in Houston than San Antonio as well. But yeah it's because us white folks are scared of the brown invasion. 




 Not sure about Episcopal but St. Thomas Episcopal has a very good one.  




 You should contact St. John's school and St. Thomas Episcopal School, they both have very good bag pipe programs and I'm sure you could find someone to help.  




 Lemme guess, you're mexican? 




 He's got like 5 years left in the tank. Prob less after all this stress.  




 You two should build a time machine and go back into the past where films *were held to a higher standard* and then jerk each other off with the tears from all the laughter.  




 You basically called me Toby.  




 Sure, if you were white.  




 Why? If you think the Bible Belt is the worst place to be an atheist you're not smart.  




 The only way you could know if she never once looked up at the stage was if you never once took your eyes off of her.  




 Clever? Sure. Ingenious? Naw.  




 People don't get legally executed in the bible belt for being atheists, so no it's probably not the worst place to be an atheist.  




 lol you talk like its some kind of rule or you know enough high level drug dealers to make an educated statement on the matter.  




 Which probably leads to all the crazy - specifically Japanese - kink porn bred out of a repressed sexual society.  




 You know a lot about smash.  




 If you literally hate *people*, like in general, they probably did raise you wrong.  




 Seems like an easy fix to that would be that the longer the wineup, the higher the priority. 




 My only let down with this movie was that one of them didn't wear the Minotaur costume at the last battle. One of my favs though.  




 Sorry. I'll be more tactful.

At a gas station buy water, mineral water or unsweet tea for a drink and almonds or peanuts or jerky (careful as some have a lot of added sugar but it's easy to find some with minimal - which isn't a bad thing) as a snack.

You're right, it's not easy but it is simple. You just have to adjust the way you approach purchasing food. I was in the same boat and felt the same way you do, but with a little bit of foresight and willpower, it's easy to not consume heavily processed junk food. Buy fruits at the grocery store, take them with you. Buy frozen fruit (i prefer raspberries which are very low in sugar and blueberries) and [edemame](http://www.seapointfarms.com/new_products_pages/lightly-salted.html) for quick and easy snacks that are high in fiber, protein and vitamins.

Drink hot tea or black coffee. Buy chicken breast (bags of frozen chicken breasts are cheap, healthy and easy to work with). Buy seasonal vegetables. Canned tuna is extremely healthy, make a tuna salad with 0% greek yogurt, celery, and whatever else you like in it. If you have to have bread/pastas buy whole wheat with the least amount of sugars (though those carbs are broken down to sugar so even 'sugar free' bread technically has sugars).

Get a crock pot, make stews with lots of vegetables and some meat. Lentils, quinoa, black beans are great sources of fiber and protein, are cheap and are filling.

You'll find it gets easier and easier to adjust your eating and buying habits the further along you go. I consume very little food which has added sugar and it just takes a little bit of self control to get there.

Good luck and sorry if I was an asshole earlier, just trying to help out.

Lost about 80 pounds the past 18 months by adjusting my habits. Cutting out that (excess) sugar is so worth it and I hope you manage to make it a reality. 

  

 




 Hey Yao!

First I just wanted to say that I'm a huge Rockets fan and you and T-Mac were my favorite players of the 00s. It was truly a privilege watching you play, laugh, joke and be an ambassador for the sport of basketball and for your home country of China.

I've got a question about basketball and a question about your humanitarian work, I'll start with basketball.

What was your favorite moment from your career on the Rockets? My greatest memory was the playoff game against the Lakers were you went to the locker room with an apparent injury, only to emerge a bit later in the game to lead your team to the win in LA.

You've already had a successful public campaign against the consumption of shark fin, and now what will surely be a successful campaign in Africa. What will be the next big project you tackle? Will you follow in the trend of a humane approach to animal protection or do you see yourself shifting towards other projects and problems? Also, would you ever consider teaming up with Deke as two towers of humanitarian work?

Thanks for using your global appeal to change the world for the better. We need more people like you out there that aren't afraid to use their fame, stature and respect to change the world for the better and it was an absolute privileged watching you play basketball.

 




 Stop fucking shopping at convenience stores. Buy food that isn't in packages. Drink liquids that don't have sugar. It's essy, you're just conditioned to think otherwise because you don't know how to shop. There are so many options, but if you expect to eat what you were eating before just minus sugar yeah you're gonna have a problem. 




 Brodhisattvas 




 I also found out it is extremely hard to find stuff WITHOUT sugar(or sugar substitute) in America.

It's really not though. Like at all. It's actually pretty easy. 




 Me when your mom asks wants if I want seconds. 




 Lake Placid 




 well here is the city of houston boundary: http://imgur.com/0yQKaC8

thought maybe he rotated at first but that doesn't even line up. not sure where his base came from.

e: the little bunny looks like the top right isolated boundary but it's mirrored. 

 




 nice 




 Should change it to Hareston so you keep the H. 




 I do, I think what I proposed is the best course of action in his situation. 




 Cool I guess we have different memories or something.  




 Haha fair enough. Rough stuff if you didn't even notice a rib injury! Gotten a bruised rib once and it was one of the most lingering painful injuries I've had.  




 Bruised ribs are fucking awful. And the worst part is everything is so much funnier with a bruised rib. Cruel joke.  




 I know. Just don't remember 'We did it Reddit' until Boston.  




 Sounds about right. 




 Meh 




 Has it? I only remember it entering the popular lexicon of reddit after the Boston bomber fiasco.  




 God damn you sound like a straight up cunt.  




 Post about it to /r/nosleep with perfect grammar and incredible narrative. I know that's what id do after losing my whole family.  




 You would have known if you had a broken or cracked rib.  




 Just curious. Was asking him but everyone else and their mother seemed to feel obligated to chime in on the matter. 




 You asked for the logic behind it.  




 And about as much as that comment? Congrats.  




 There weren't subdeddits 8 years ago.  




 Just curious, but why have an account if you contribute so little? 




 Ah, there it is. 




 Same to you guys! Can't wait for Saturday. Should be a great game. 




 If we still had Asik we wouldn't have Ariza/Terry/Papanikalou.

I think we're better off. 









 meatballs killed my toilet this morning 




 You felt like a Bench 




 Terry had a great game.  




 Hey do you think I can get a personal reply?

Cheers,

Michael Ainsworth 




 Oh, my bad. I thought I was talking to children.  




 Coo 




 Why? Why is there more value in a true story than a fictional one? This isn't a thing that the truth makes more valuable.  




 I'm gonna use kerfuffle today. Thanks. Forgot about that word. 




 Protests.

The Arab Spring were protests yall.

The Arab Spring led to fall of numerous Arab governments. They weren't simply protests.

Occupy NY, those were protests.  




 You people seriously need to get the fuck off reddit and reevaluate yalls lives.  




 Why? I liked Gaurdians of the Galaxy and the fact that it didn't happen doesn't change that. Why is the truth so important for a subreddit like /r/tifu? I'd rather have fake, well written stories than real, poorly written ones.

But I guess we're the vanguards of truth up in here.  




 Why the hell do you people whine about something that isn't real, that doesn't do anything, that you supposedly don't care about.... unless someone else gets it?

Like seeiously, take the day to reevaluate your priorities.  




 Why the fuck can't we just enjoy things without worrying whether or not it's true? Jesus Christ, you aren't a fucking detective. Just enjoy, it was a good story and was well written. Yet you whine that it's not "true" enough for your standards.


This bullshit ruins posts. Him writing a fictional story didn't ruin the post, your need for whatever the fuck you're looking for when you go detective mode ruins the post. Why the hell can't you people just suspend reality for 2 seconds, read the story, react to it and move on. You don't have to treat it like the gospel.

Yeesh.  




 He wouldn't, sista-bear.  




 One thing is for sure; this has been a great start to the season for the Rockets to pad their "pretty much meaningless historical comparisons stats". 




 I'd really love a chance to play yall in the playoffs, it would be a great series. Pretty sure heading into this season we're tied up in our franchises head to head play.  




 Work put him up? Use your imagination.   




 It's been a week. Yall will come back after everyone's healthy and contend.  




 Yeah, but you can't value a player based on his team.

Eh, I disagree man. Morey matches that offer sheet if Bosh had signed with us. The market dictated his value so high because team(s) were willing to overpay based on their teams contract situations (Rockets w/ being able to sign RFA over the cap   Mavs w/ Dirk taking a major paycut).

I do however think this was a very unique situation which we won't see again for a long time.

And agreed that he'll be impossible to trade if they ever want to.  




 I'm not even talking about stats; Parsons had 29 last night. I'm talking about cohesion, chemistry and their complimentary skill sets. This year's team hums like a machine whereas last year's squad seemed to step on each other's toes frequently which would grind the train to a stop. Harden/Lin/Parsons all had similar offensive repoitoires which would create knots in the offense. Now Harden has free reign of the mid range, and shooters on the wings. You know, in theory.  




 Oh god I'm getting giddy just thinking about reddit's reaction to a Heat/Rockets finals. Two most hated teams past couple years. This feels like a great partnership in evil.  




 see: the 2008 houston rockets 




 The only thing glue and Parsons have in common is their pigmentation. 




 I think Parsons has more value as an individual player but Ariza is a better player when you have elite interior and perimeter players. 




 I guess where I'm coming from is a heads up basis. If I had to choose between Ariza and Parsons to build a team around, I'd take Parsons every day. When the team they're put on+their salary are taken into consideration, Ariza is by far the better option .
