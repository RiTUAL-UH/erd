  Actually, Marx said socialism is the political stage before Communism. In socialism the government controls the means of production and distribution. The word control does not just mean outright ownership. Control can mean the government allows  private ownership of business or industries but that it controls how ownership makes decisions, production, access to raw materials, distribution channels etc etc etc

 The Fascists were socialists. Mussolini was a devout socialist leader and writer. He envisioned a type of socialism that featured extreme nationalism. This is common basic history.

 Professor said the Nazis were right wing. Actually the Nazis were socialists (edit note: it amazes me how many uneducated people are down voting this comment.  Yes, I know you were told the Nazis were right wing but that refers to the socialist political spectrum not the entire political spectrum) 














 Naziism was a socialist political movement. The Nazis, AKA the National Socialist German Workers Party, believed in government control over the means of production and distribution and a government centric society at the expense of individual liberty. Hitler was a devout socialist leader and writer. He felt that standard socialism was too slow and he  felt Naziism offered a better socialist path. He disliked communists because he felt they were too internationally focused and that they contained too many Jewish members. 

Hitler was a true socialist as was Mussolini. They were certainly not Communists. Socialism works on paper but always fails in real life. The reason? Because ultimately, the government (acting in proxy for the community) must use force to compel the people to comply. It is at that point that all socialist societies resort to violence to force the people to obey. 

The US has killed many during its history and yes some of those people have been innocents. But you simply can't compare what the US has done in its history with what socialist regimes have done in their histories. The US have killed mostly combatants that were actively trying to kill Americans. Did Pol Pot do the same? Mao? Hitler? Stalin? Tito? Ceauescu?  No, the difference is that those regimes used violence to compel civilians to obey. They used murder, starvation, secret police, active campaigns to force compliance to official policy. 

 









 It shouldn't be but sadly it is. Whenever an issue becomes politicized, facts become scarce 














 What about the socialist regimes that have led to 100 million deaths? Remember Pol Pot, the Soviets, Cubans, China, Nazis, Fascists? What about them? Also did you know that the Scandinavian countries practice socialism lite, rich, homogenous, the US pays for it's military protection? What will happen to those countries once immigrants from the middle east overwhelm their social safety nets? 




 Socialism is cancer to a nation. Eliminating Leftist policies are the best thing any country can do to push themselves forward

 Marx said that socialism required government control over the means of production. That may or may not mean outright ownership of a company or industry by the government. It can also mean the fovernment allows a company or industry to remain in private hands but falls under srtict governments control. 
With regard to the Nazis, the government allowed many armament  companies to remain in private hands but it kept strict control over the companies' decision making on out puts, pricing, and access to raw materials. Examples include Krupps, volkswagen, Mercedes Benz, focker, mauser etc etc etc 




 Yawn. Considering your lack of education, maybe you should stick to commenting on r/videogames. I am so tired of uneducated high school teens debating factual issues with their simplistic opinions. Facts are facts. No  matter how much they conflict with your juvenile worldview they still stubbornly exist.   




 I suggest you request a refund from the "college" you attended. Personally, I doubt you even graduated from high school. Telling me to fuck off, that's great. Did you learn that debating strategy from the debating team at the "college" you attended?  




 I am curious, what level of education have you achieved? I ask because discussing the subject of socialism with you is like discussing the subject of religion with a Pentecostal bible thumper. You have a set, faith based view of the world. Facts, logic, and history are meaningless to you. I suggest you open a book or do your own research to learn basic historical facts that anyone who has taken a 200 level college political science class would readily know. Good luck 




 

At the turn of the 20th century in Germany, many political philosophers took the core elements of socialism and added their own elements to it in an attempt to improve on the basic socialist model. Hitler did not like Communism because it was internationally focused and had too many Jews as members. Hence he developed his brand of socialism called National Socialism. Others created their own brands of socialism. These improved systems still retained their classical socialist elements. 

It was Marx who said that political systems were on a continuum with societies starting as agrarian, then capitalist, then socialist, and finally communist. That was Marx who said that. He stated that during the transitional phase known as socialism, government would control the means of production. That may mean ownership or it may mean coercion or legislative control over formerly private industries. Ever hear of Obamacare? The government does not own the industry but it controls it. 

Your opinions on what socialism means to you is interesting but they are not the definitions that Marx or any other socialist agrees with. I simply don't know why you are having so much trouble understanding what socialism is. I highly suggest that rather than simply guessing, you should actually study the history of socialism.   




  "improved socialist systems"

 The nazis were socialists because they were the National Socialist German Workers Party.  Their core beliefs were a government centeic society at the expence of personal liberty. They practiced in governmemt  comtrol over the means of production and distribution. Hitler was a long time socialist writer and philosopher  who envisioned Naziism as a fairer and faster form of socialism.  




 Naziism was a form of socialism. I can't  debate such an obvious historical fact. Please brush up on the subject so you can debate  intelligently in the future. Btw what level of educarion have you  achieved? Just curious 




 Marx said in communism, ownership of the means of production by the community is necessary but in socialism, the step before communism, control over the means of production is allowed and even useful  as a neccesarry transitional state. I really wish you had a greater basic knowledge of Marx and his theories. It also puzzles me how you assume your views are infallable . You are simple wrong here. Don't take it personally. The facts are the facts 




 The nazis were socialists. We really cant debate that point. You really need to study the socialist movents in Germany during the early 20th century. It is facinating how ao many tried to take the core elements of socialism and try to improve on them to make socialism better, faster, and fairer.  Naziism and Fascism were two such attempts.  




 Care to refute my facts?  Or are you only interested in silly snark?  




 Sorry but you need take some college level poly sci courses.  If you have already done so demand a refund. The Nazis and the Fascists were both socialist movements. Socialism requires  control over the means of production and distribution.  That does not equal ownership of industries, merely control. I suggest  you study the socialist movements of the early 20th century. It is a facinating field that explains how many took the core elements of socialism and tried to create a better, faster, fairer socialist system. The nazis and fascists were two such improved socialist systems. Rather than just claiming these facts are not so, why not put that effort into actually learning  about socialism. Good luck
  




 The nazis were socialists as were the  Italian  fascists. Have you ever taken a college level political science  class?  




 Hitler was a devout socialist.  Naziism was a form of socialism. You are confusing the fact that the soviets considered  them right wing. They were on the right side of the socialist political spectrum but they are on the far left of the whole political spectrum. Socialism is classified as a government  or community  centric political system that controls the means of production and distribution. That defines the nazis. Naziism took socialism and added antisemitetism to it.  




 Why is that? Are you pro Nazi and pro socialist? 




 I was making the point that it is a good thing when Naziism, which is a form of socialism fails. Naziism is a bad system. Do you disagree with that?

 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz boring 




 Blah blah blah. You are simply parroting things you have heard and don't understand.  




 I asked you a scientific question  and you can't  answer it. No matter how you avoid it that is proof you know nothing about acience.  Maybe stick to subreddits like r/spongebob? 




 That cloud looks just like a mountain! 




  The main problem is the rate of the change. In the past, nature has always been able to adapt to natural changes slowly over time. 

Earth's temperatures vary widely by season. In the space a a few months, temps can go from 100F in summer to -50 below zero in the same location. The rate of temps rising in the last century is well within the normal fluctuations observed throughout earth's history. Earth's temps are cyclical and complex. Solar activity, volcanic activity, ocean activity all impact earth's climate. What make you think that the proposed solutions, raising taxes and empowering elites, will have any impact on the climate at all?  




 You are obviously not a person versed in science. Maybe you shouldn't discuss climate change?  




 
There are no correct or normal variables for these questions, there are only correct parameters within which mankind can remain prosperous

Can you say what those parameters are? I ask because a .7 degree rise in temps over the past century is hardly a reason for concern or to spend billions needlessly. 


 




 I accept your admission of defeat. Either you can answer my questions with actual science or you can't. You can't. Good luck at Ringling Bros 




 I am still waiting for you to answer my questions. Until you do, then get a job at a carnival. 

Any clown can make silly claims. 




 You lost a debate on climate change because I had the science to prove my case. Now all you have is snark. In the end, I would rather Be the scientist than the silly jester.   




 I used science and you used religion and I defeated you. Science....deal with it... 




 You were beaten by a smarter, better person today. Nothing to be ashamed of. I'm sure your religion is important to you. 




 I hope you realize that a climate change skeptic debated you today and kicked your butt. Victory is indeed sweet! 


































 Yup, I thought so. You can't answer the question. That means your position is not science. Your position is political, philosophical, or religious. Praise Gaia! 




 If you can't establish what temperatures and CO2 levels are needed to save the planet then your argument is non scientific. Think about it.... 




 Lets stick to facts:

If climate change is indeed a scientifically based problem, then you must be able to establish a factual baseline for which all measurements of possible damage and solutions can be based.

What are the correct and normal atmospheric temperature(s) for Earth?

What are the correct and normal ocean temperature(s) for Earth?

What is the correct and normal CO2 level for Earth?

If you (or anyone else) cannot answer these questions then the issue of the dangers of climate change is not scientifically based and therefor is either politically, philosophically, or religiously based 




  but temps are still rising at a rate of 0.05C/yr.

That figure is well within the margin of error. Translation: not a reliable or provable fact.

 Rather than merely claiming my sources are compromised, can you point out which of their claims are factually incorrect? Has there or has there not been an 18 year pause in rising temps? Have all climate change models predicting fast rises of temps been wrong or correct? Have temp reading been enhanced rather than simply reported? Have climate change proponents emails admitted lies, changed data, and an organized campaign of retribution against anyone who opposed them?

Can you deny that Leftist politics has seriously influenced climate science?

Can you deny that major climate change proponents have lied, changed data, are influenced by politics, or are influenced by grant money? 





























 The 97% of scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change is occurring claim has been thoroughly debunked.

http://www.thegwpf.org/new-paper-the-97-consensus-and-its-critics/

http://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2014/09/Warming-consensus-and-it-critics1.pdf

The 97% claim is based on a study by John Cook. His emails on the study are revealing:

"Its essential that the public understands that theres a scientific consensus on AGW. So [Skeptical Science activists] Jim Powell, Dana [Nucitelli] and I have been working on something over the last few months that we hope will have a game changing impact on the public perception of consensus. Basically, we hope to establish that not only is there a consensus, there is a strengthening consensus." -John Cook

Two things are immediately apparent from this email: Cook had decided even before he began his investigations what those investigations would reveal.    This was always going to be a PR exercise, not a scientific one.
    

Cook's own emails further destroy any credibility in the 97% figure be showing his intentionally misleading methodology:

"Okay, so weve ruled out a definition of AGW being any amount of human influence or more than 50 percent human influence. Were basically going with Aris porno approach (I probably should stop calling it that) which is AGW = humans are causing global warming. e.g.  no specific quantification which is the only way we can do it considering the breadth of papers were surveying." -John Cook

But Cooks 97 percent consensus claim was rebutted in subsequent analyses of his study. A paper by five leading climatologists published in the journal Science and Education last year found that Cooks study misrepresented the views of most consensus scientists.

The definition Cook used to get his consensus was weak, the climatologists said. Only 41 out of the 11,944 published climate studies examined by Cook explicitly stated that mankind caused most of the warming since 1950 meaning the actual consensus is 0.3 percent.  




 The climate systems, ocean systems, solar activity, and all other factors that effect Earth's climate are very complex. 

The fact that all models predicting temperature rises have been woefully wrong compared to actual data proves this.

This graph proves there has indeed been a pause in global temperatures for 18 years and running:

The data for the graph above is from RSS satellite.

You said:

There is no ideal temperature for Earth

there is no constant to provide as an answer, CO2 levels are always changing

So how do we know that the current (or future)  temp and CO2 levels are bad? Doesn't that defeat your entire premise?



 




 Let me see your cites professor 




 So you agree then that there is no scientific significance to the term consensus. Our understanding of any scientific field of study, at any given time,   is but a point on a moving continuum. We should never simply conclude that we know enough and quit a scientific field.  




 First of all, that 97% of scientists figure has been thoroughly debunked. That survey was made of a hundred odd scientists, the vast majority of which were not climatologists. 

If we understand the climate systems involved as you claim, can you explain:

The 18 year pause in temperature increase? 

Why every climate model has been incorrect?

What the best temperature for Earth should be?

What the best CO2 level for Earth should be?

 




 There is no such determination. Ever hear of the Scientific Method?  




 The climate always changes. The question is whether man is contributing to an increase in temperatures that is disastrously harmful.  









 It's a fake issue designed to increase taxes and empower elites.
