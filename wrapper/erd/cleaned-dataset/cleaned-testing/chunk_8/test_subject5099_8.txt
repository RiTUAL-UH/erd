 Video games, thats about it :/ 




 What's on my mind is that I don't find myself with much of a future, as most people, even my father, find me purely despicable. 




 Thing is, she wants me to kill myself, and I still love her, I care about her more than myself, and I just want to do as she asks, added onto the lack of hope I have left for any real reason to live. 




 You obviously don't know Yetii 




 Could be OldManWillakers, Rurikar22, nisovin, and Jintozen, or really any of Rob's alts 




 NOPE, AMAZINGLY CUTE, THANK YOU

 I say the same, okay, yes, it is annoying and unbalanced, but the real Roamin would do it, so to "firespam" is its design.

I fight because I find myself obligated, but when the fights are boring, and I relive my losses, I quit, and give my memories, as well as protect the sword I am sworn to, Orion. 




 But I can't be lost forever, sadly, our world for whatever reason doesn't allow us to do that. We end up as failures, I just want to go before I end up that way in the end :/
 




 I would do things I liked to do, if it wasn't for the fact all I likedcto do was things with her. I can't help anyone, anyone I try to help just ends up hating me in the end, I just don't want
 to do that to people anymore, to hurt anymore, I just want to be gone :/ 




 I'm a rather depressed person. For about 5 years of my life, I felt lost, without anything to aim for in my life but maybe a chance I could find a reason. And then, one day, after a bit of time, I found that reason.

I found her.

And I know what you're thinking, he's going to kill himself over a girl, it's not worth it, I know that.

She was more than a girl, she was my reason to live.

We met eachother through a game, we lived across an ocean from eachother. We loved eachother, but we had issues with what we did by ourselves. Me much more than her. I cause breaks like this with everyone. I don't have friends, I don't know where to get help, I was sent to a mental hospital, it fixed nothing, my following therapist, nothing.

I am talking here, because I had no friends. Everyone I have ever talked to has one way or another turned out to hate me. I just wanted someone to talk to, that's all. I have little hope, but I need to know if someone, anyone out there cares about who I am for more than just a human, for me, JT.

And if there is not, then may there be salvation beyond.

 This one came out of the crevese in dogekac and made its way into the shrine, capturing one of the dwarves inside it. 




 No Problem :L

 I personally got to see the Kraken about a year ago, and I can dig up screenshots at your request, no video though. 




 I walked into the room, instantly feeling a sense of, *emptiness* in the room. It was clearly lit by the full panel windows along the walls, but the light didnt reach the back recesses, to the staircase. It was nearing night, and patrol would need to start again to keep the monsters out. It had been a few days since the last attack, and the pink sky out the window seemed to fully encompass that bliss that many of them had been feeling. They were still warned however, to not go beyond the shrines reach, because if they do and die out there, they would not have the shrines timewarp ability, and they would be eternally doomed to a death of nothingness. 

I sat down in the chair outwards from the table, and had a look around. The room was mostly bare, but bookcases lined the walls that the windows did not. Books filled with history and knowledge of the Dwarves past and even before that, before the calamity. These books and this house held the utmost importance to this outpost, as this was home to the second oldest living dwarf, and not only was he the ancient in his status, but he is also ancient in name. He is the last surviving titled warrior of the dwarves, a practice that was ceased a long time ago, after one certain title was killed beyond the shrine. After that title died, The Old Man never titled another dwarf again, realizing that giving these warriors titles and then losing them was causing more morale loss among the dwarves than needed, and was unnecessary. 

Slowly, more and more of the remaining titles were lost to the place beyond shrine jurisdiction, and eventually that left one. At 23 dwarven lifetimes, he is only four lifetimes younger than The Old Man himself, and because of this, he experienced much of the important events that had befallen the dwarves. So, this dwarf, was forever to have the occupation of The Rememberer, which has now become his name, as no other name seems to fall upon him. His job was to answer the dwarves any questions they might have that could pertain to the past and all events in it to his knowledge. 

Thats what I was here for, I had vaguely heard rumors and seen inscriptions of one certain topic in particular and I had come to ask The Rememberer if he knew its origin or meaning. The question befell on me each night when I saw a vision of the inscription each time I shut my eyes, of the bright blade that shone brighter than all others, but was not that legendary sword of the Old Mans , but was another, beside his, with another name below it.

While in thought, a small, quiet voice asked me, Yes, Jimmy, what are you here for? What is it that you seek to learn?

He slowly walked to me, with a cane in hand, and sat in the chair infront of mine. He sat there, giving me a questioning gaze with that bright blue eye of his. He only had one, the other was lost lifetimes ago, in another battle; no one had asked. He had one rule about questions of the past, no dwarf was to ever ask about *him* and his involvement in dwarven lore, and so the mystery of his eye and his title are known to very few surviving dwarves, and they do not utter a single word. 

I quickly composed myself and as fast as I could asked the question that was burning inside my mind, Who was; The Deathseeker?

Excuse me son, what was that? He asked, as if completely dumbfounded that such an audacious question could befall upon him.

Well, sir, I had been seeing some visions of an inscription I saw a little bit ago

I dont need backstory, he interrupts, just ask the question again.

Well, who was the Deathseeker?

He sat there for a few moments, and put his face in his hands, for several minutes he sat in silence, and then very quickly outbursted, I dont know what youre talking about, Im sorry, I dont have that information, goodbye.

Dont you think they have a right to know, JT? a soft, low voice said. Across the room near the door stood none other than the General himself, OldManWillakers.

No, Bruce, they dont, it need not concern them and theres no reason to lose more lives because of a dumb prophecy. The longer they dont know, the better. The Rememberer said, very quickly and coldy to the General. It had surprised me to hear him say The Old Mans first name, something no other dwarf had ever said and lived to say again.

Just because you refuse to use its power because of your loss does not mean another Deathseeker cant after you. There is no reason to be withholding this information from them, it doesnt hurt them to know, if they want to know, tell them. She was important to me too, you know The Old Man said.

It doesnt hurt them not to know either Bruce, so what does it really matter? And please, dont talk about her. The Rememberer said, almost moving to tears over his last statement.

I began to tune out their bickering as it seemed not to be going anywhere important, just endless arguing, so I began to look about the room some more. Something I had appeared to miss now shone from the falling sun, up against the wall by the staircase was two very unique items. One of them I very clearly recognized, was the bow known as Brenna, used by the Ranger JT, who had supposedly fallen many lifetimes ago, one of the first to fall. However, he did note that Bruce had called The Rememberer JT, and no one had ever asked about JT specifically in the past, it was possible that the dwarf standing before him was JT himself, but it didnt change much if he was, beyond the name. 

The other weapon however, was more curious. A shiny Silver Blade sat in a glass case, and I couldnt look directly at it, as the shine off of it made it nearly impossible to do so. Its shape was not unlike that of the Dwarven Runeblade, yet, slightly bulkier. It did not have the same bend of a holy blade, this sword was much different from them.

The Old Man and JT seemingly stopped arguing, with The Old Man walking up to me, saying The Rememberer here has agreed to give you your answer, but I am going to give it to you.

The Deathseeker is a legendary hero of the dwarves, able to unlock the power of a sword nearly as powerful as Excaliju; Orion, the Silver Blade.

I glanced back over at the case, this sword seemingly to fit the description.

This blade could blind the monsters with its shine, and cripple them from escape, allowing for an easy powerful swing to end their undead lives. Only one Deathseeker can live at one time, and when one passes, another can then realize his potential with the Blade. The Old Man explained.

However, the last Deathseeker to be known did not use the Blade, and instead kept its knowledge from the dwarves for thousands of years, as well as hiding its prophecy and inscriptions.

The current Deathseeker is the man that stands before you, and that is his blade, in the case, never to be used until he passes

Never to be used again, I hope. JT interrupts.

You wasted your ability to use that blade, you could have helped purify so many places and you wasted it. Bruce sternly said.

Because that sword gives nothing but trouble, and I wanted nothing to do with spreading its curse to others. JT retaliated.

The curse is a small price to pay for power. Bruce said.

It wasnt a small price JT trailed off, seemingly on the break of tears, Get out Jimmy, thats the story, now leave. 

I got up and left the room, heading out back to my barracks to start my shift on patrol, and think over what I just learned.
