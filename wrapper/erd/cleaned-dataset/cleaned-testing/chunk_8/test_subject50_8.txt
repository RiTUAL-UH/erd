 Maybe, organs have to be healthy, and people have to die. We're getting good at preventing death while not being healthy. 

TBH, every time I've had to go to get a new driver's license since I turned 18 (so twice now...AZ licenses expire when you turn 65), I've been verbally asked if I would like to be a donor (which of course, is yes). I'd be interested in seeing how many organ donors there are in developed nations to put this type of "we need an opt out system" in perspective. 




 I think some people may have religious qualms. Such as: keeping the body together after death (putting them in an urn is considered together). I remember hearing that spreading your ashes across some space (ocean, space, etc) was not considered a Catholic burial in high school 




 In all likelihood this study was funded before the original paper had been debunked and thus the money was already "spent." While unfortunate that funds are allocated this way, it does help maintain normalcy. 




 I get shocked a lot, despite moving to a much more humid climate 




 Having been shocked by 1200V and 15kV sources (separately) that run in the microamp range, you'll fucking feel it, for hours. Just an odd tingling sensation after the initial "Oh fuck that hurts!" as it's burning you goes away. 




 That was going to be my exact comment. 




 Honestly, I can never get through all those carrots (seriously, most other things I can). Maybe this would allow them to sell in smaller quantities so I don't waste it 




 How does this help with produce? 




 Usually the factored in cost here, with regard to human cost, is [quality adjusted life years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year). At least that's according to those in public health, so who knows if they have people's best interest in mind?/s 




 So I had the same adviser for undergrad and graduate school and went straight through to get my PhD in Biosystems Engineering. In undergrad I told him I wanted to get a PhD and was open to both options. When I got into grad school I told him that I was more interested in working in industry. We worked a lot with industry. In fact, they were our primary funding source for most, if not all, the time I was in grad school.

He always tried to steer me a bit towards academia, but I always told him, and my committee, that I was more interested in industry. We actually spent a fair amount of time talking about it, which was very valuable. One of my professors spent a large portion of his career in industry and then moved back to academia when he was older and I'd say he's one of the better professors for having that experience.

One thing to keep in mind is that while publications don't necessarily matter in industry, getting them in grad school does matter to industry (if that's the track you take. I had a friend to an MS in aerospace that never published and it was totally fine because he did a big design project or something). The thing is, it's a good experience, IMO, to have some less than random person who is supposed to be anonymous rip through something you've worked on for months-years in an attempt to make it better.

Now, when it came time to graduate last August, you can bet your ass I was looking at Academic Keys for a PostDoc position as much as I was looking for a job through Indeed.com, BMES, etc. I ended up getting a research/development job in industry that, so far, has turned out quite well. Everyone told me "Remember where you came from," when I told them (I also moved 1800 miles), but also congratulations. I think being open with them about what you hope to do is going to benefit you because if the professor(s) have been around for a little while, they've had a student with similar, if not identical thoughts. 




 That's what I've never understood when IMF/WB/US go into a country that has comparatively 0 GDP. Why not work with them through investments that actually lift people out of poverty so they can then ask for more money to build nicer things and make everyone more money. I know this is extremely simplified, but it seems like a win win. 




 I ask my friends "can't or won't?" a lot. They all watch Archer and usually it's both.
