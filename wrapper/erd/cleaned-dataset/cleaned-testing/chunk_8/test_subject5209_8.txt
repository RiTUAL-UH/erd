 Tahoe. You know your center consoles, eh? 




 My penis has been in your daughter's mouth. 




 I'd say the birth of Jesus.

I'd sneak in and replace the 8 lbs, 6 oz Savior with the baby prop from American Sniper and see how long it takes the wise men to notice. 




 "Don't be stupid." - My dad 




 Police officer. 




 A montage of furious masturbation, set to 80's music. 




 Math. 














 Sometimes that's all you need. 




 Maybe if it was a question mark instead of a period, it would work out better. 




 HULK SMASH...dat ass. 




 Yeah, that would put you on a list somewhere. 




 Have to keep them warm somehow. 




 The gerbils? 




 Ass 2.0 comes with a flatulence volume level. 









 "Oh, this? It's not mine. I'm just holding it for a friend." 




 Freeze tag. 




 Getting head in the back of the theater while watching Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls.

It's the only thing that made that movie watchable for me. 




 Buy clothes that made me look good for a change. 




 Balls of Fury 




 What if that's the only way he has to cut up hot dogs to put in his spaghetti?

Thursday night's spaghetti madness would be ruined! 




 How big was Jesus' penis? 




 Beyonc. She thinks girls run the world already anyway. 




 Wonder where my wife is. 




 A bowling pin balanced on two chopsticks. 




 After I made it, I saw a St. Bernard with cow utters.

 Joyous annual celebration of your liberation from uterian captivity!

 That's the biggest brick of weed I have ever seen. 




 Sure, don't take tips from [this](https://youtu.be/pQcKVUQ4dDg?t=59m) woman.

 That's what she said.

 How Can We Think, If We Don't Have Brains? 




 Or you can use the same name and focus on the world of Harry Potter. 




 If the things in my imagination actually happened...this world would be a fucked up place. 




 Sneaky little hobbitses. Tricksy! 




 I had religion forced upon me all through my childhood. When I was old enough to say, "I'm not going to church today", I did that...every Sunday and Wednesday for the last 15 years.

I felt so free from people scrutinizing my life and judging my actions. Now, I'm married...and back in the same boat. Fuck. 




 When I was younger, I broke my ankle coming out of a bathroom at a strip club. I told my parents that I slipped on some ice outside of my cousin's condo and broke it when I landed awkwardly on a car in the parking lot. 




 Doesn't matter, had sex. 









 Thanks! 




 Sorry for your loss. Your dad sounds awesome. Sounds like you honored him greatly by injecting his personality and sense of fun into the services.

 And a "No Groping" sign right beside you. 




 Do hot girls eat chili? 




 Cool. I guess you wouldn't mind if I tape my dick to your forehead, so you can cd's nuts? 




 Cool.  I can only hope to be like that when I'm older. Fun and full of life, instead of joyless and depressing like I've seen some people become in their golden years. 




 With Kirstie Alley in attendance? 




 On which mode - Easy, Medium, Hard, or Expert? 




 Like [this](http://www.keepbusy.net/content/boneless-girl.swf)? 




 So do you.  
  
Do you like tapes and CD's? 




 Then you could come back 4 years later and make a shitty funeral sequel, where you are controlled by voodoo. 




 Your grandparents sound like they are/were fun people. 




 Did you fill her boots up with sand and put a stiff drink in her hand? 




 That's a very noble idea. 




 I like your style.  
  
I would say that I hope you die soon, so maybe I could join the BBQ...but I don't want that. 




 Design your casket to look like the Death Star and have your pallbearers dressed in Jedi or Sith robes...people would buy tickets in advance to your funeral. 




 DJ Rigor Mortis, in the hizzay!!  If you're dead and you know it, leave your hands down! 




 Once people are high as fuck...there is no dilemma. That friend cake is going down!

 Worst. Sand castle. Ever. 




 Get those bitches some tissues. Bitches love tissues. 




 This answer also works for the question, "What would you do for a Klondike bar?".
