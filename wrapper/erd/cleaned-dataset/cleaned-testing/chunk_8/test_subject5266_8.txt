 Yeh but there's lots of cultural stuff we don't adhere to anymore, so its not really an excuse, although I know you're not excusing it 




 Mgs has never been that subtle in terms of exposition, so I didn't see a discord. 




 Kojima's games are very anti-war so I expect this game to be no different and potentially more confronting including the child soldier stuff mentioned in other games.

Its most likely going to be the most hellish game of the series' given the characters, subject matter and it evoking classic anti war Oliver Stone films like Platoon. 




 Played Peace Walker before this second time playing MGS4...

Big Boss' death ;_; omg so damn fucking tragic.

All the regret and sorrow for what he did to the world, chained to the shackles of his ideals of "liberty". Giving Solid the true freedom to stop fighting and take peace.

Holy fuck, after Peace Walker too, when The Boss AI accepts peace and this angers Big Boss in that game, here you see him finally accept it.

Jesus christ, this is the same game where a weirdo soldier poops his butt for a whole act. Lol.

Seriously, fantastic ending. 




 Awesome 




 This looks great! How did they make this? I prefer new tomb raider but old TR is cool too :) is this based on an alien invasion? Will it feature the orson welles radioplay? Omg that'd be amazing, imagine that - probably copyright issues though with that. 




 Fair enough, I definitely think there is a huge space for historically accurate games! History is so damn rich and it's weird that Ubisoft is the only AAA dev to really use it outside of wars. 




 hows gaming on it? steam, gog, etc? 









 To be fair to Assassin's creed, those games engage people with history far more than most other popular media. When I played Assassin's creed, I won't deny that I googled the American revolution to get more immersed in the world. Whose to say other people didn't delve even further as a result?

Think I'm going to do a video on that at some point actually, could be interesting topic. 














 Iran is such a fascinating country with a tumultuous history, I absolutely loved "The Cat and the Coup" - a free, simple and interesting, game on steam. Gives you some interesting political history about the country in the 50's, which might give some good background/context to the next 1979 revolution? I can't remember.

This will be very interesting to see the 1979 revolution. Wow. I am actually really excited, I love seeing non-western centric politics in games, it just feels a bit refreshing ya know?

 




 Yeah basically anything fan service-y (right word yes?) is pretty cringe. That said, I wouldnt mind seeing it even out with:

1. Less scantily clad women
2. More sexualised men

Sexuality in and of itself is not a bad thing. It is bad when the character is an object to the audience and/or is dressed/acts to allure the audience.

Positive example: MGS4 is an ass simulator, and whose ass you looking at? Snakes. (Ignoring the leery camerawork on the women in the game here)

I think the main issue is when women are treated like sexual objects for audience pleasure in games. The game of war ad evokes that, although Kate Upton im sure IRL is a very capable human being.

Snake, on the otherhand, is a fully realized character and also happens to wear skin tight outfit with no shame in his old muscley man body. If that can be conveyed with a woman that would be no real issue to me. 




 I see no benefit to starting a witch hunt, which is the kind of thing that happens inadvertedly after these kinds of reviews, especially to smaller devs with no PR, company or fanbase - based on a few kickstarter discrepancies. 

People attributing malice is pretty extreme accusation.  




 They might have got friends and family to chip in? Kickstarter is a complete gamble, I don't feel it has the credence to justify an outrage if you pay money to a kickstarter (an obscure one at that) it's not the same as thinking your buying a finished product. 

In terms of Steam, there are refunds these days anyway. 

This review seems out of place, I am still uncomfortable it was published in this current fashion, given the potential online knock on effects. 




 People equate honesty in disliking something with being agressive, I see that as a false equation. You can recommend against buying a game without dropping outrage that will inadvertedly spur on a huge audience to make this devs life miserable. 

1 . Ending a review with "Unfortunately I didn't enjoy this game much, especially the character models, which needed more work to scare me. I hope the developer can learn from these points with future games. 1/10" is different from "Oh, and the scary little girl looks shit. 1/10"

They convey different attitudes to the audience.

2 . Jim is a top tier reviewer, there are games with bigger potential audiences that would probably appreciate a review from him more than a small indie dev who probably didnt' expect to get much attention at all. There are knock on effects to doing an anomalous review in this way.

It's a sledgehammer approach the gaming community often misapplies.  




 People will use words like "scam" to justify their own torrents of disdain, though. Feeling righteous is the path to actually doing a lot of damage, sadly. His audience could easily take this way too far based off the "feeling" of the review alone.

I also don't agree with the idea that small games shouldn't be criticized, because people have feeling.I also don't agree with the idea that small games shouldn't be criticized, because people have feeling.

Criticism comes in many different forms, and some are more appropriate than others, especially with context. You can say very similar messages in different ways. Obviously no one is saying they can't be criticized, but what about constructive criticism? Why does there have to be a tone of outrage to the review, what does that do to improve the lives of consumers and creators? 




 Jim, when talking about a game he enjoys, is actually the reason I keep abreast of his work. He does brilliant explanations on why he loves something in a game.

Re: Squirty plays, I like them when Jim enjoys the game, when he dislikes it, it sometimes gets out of hand, especially when you see the audience comments afterwards. Even when Jim doesn't use pejorative language, the comments may do it anyway :/

To be fair though, there are some Squirty plays that Jim probably isn't enjoying, but still plays it earnestly and without pejorative language.

I find the whole "honest reaction" thing a bit skewed, though, because while we may occaisionally swear "honestly" at the TV or whatever in our private homes, it's not the same when you broadcast that to an audience of thousands who will then interpret and run with it in numerous, often incorrect, ways. 




 Yeah look, most people would expect some criticism for any game they put out there (I plan on releasing a game at some point, after all). Unfortunately, with a high profile critic (with a huge audience) and a review that gives it a 1/10 without much context as to who the dev is and the last word of the review being "shit" - well, that's a nuclear strike for a smaller developer.

Consider this: huge companies have had to mobilize huge PR teams to counter Jim's ire and the audience reaction that comes with it.

I dunno, I just feel uncomfortable about this kind of review. 




 That second user comment on the review page (from user "The Gustavler") :/ not cool

I feel Jim would be happier if he focused on other games instead of finding small games he can tear into. How much of his audience would have played this game? How many are going to play it now and flood the developers page with vitriol because of this review? What will that achieve?

Im worried about the negative aura gaming community is cultivating.

Anyway I really enjoy Jim's work generally speaking, just prefer less negativity. 




 Classic Harley Quinn Design ? 10/10 will buy
