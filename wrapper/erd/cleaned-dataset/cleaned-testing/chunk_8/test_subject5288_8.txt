 Not the OP, but Charizard :D 




 Why do such horrible things keep on happening? 




 Nope. Was the first day of class, went with my sister for admission. 




 Seriously. Never expected this. 




 xD 




 She just stared screaming "Get out!". I don't just know what happened. 




 No, an external coaching class... 




 Got pushed out of a chemistry classtoday in Pune when the teacher understood I was a Gujurati, with she screaming at the top of her voice, "You guys do business, don't come for academics." :( 




 /uj I hope /u/ladfrombrad you are not offended :) 




 Numix and Numix circle icon pack...  Numix is really nice. 




 Yes, I am Indian, and I watch Bollywood movies, but I found only some of them like Lagaan, 3 Idiots or PK to be great. I prefer Hollywood animated movies over anything. 




 Thanks! :D 




 Mmmmmm...... is... [this](http://imgur.com/4mvJeZS)... enough for a sample???  




 :'( 




 Ummmm.... I don't think so... 




 /uj I don't mean to replace Duarte with Pichai, but just a temporary fun experiment. 




 ladfrombrad = ~~shillfrombrad~~  


Stalinfrombrad. 




 I'm pretty sure it will, it has a 100% rating on RT as of yet! 




 The first ten minutes of Up were the most emotional moments in any animated movie. 




 Brave was okay-ish at best. Pixar hasn't really made an excellent film after TS3. 




 Well... the movie wasn't so popular in my country, so I had never heard of it. And as I was on an animated movie watching spree, I just stumbled across this one and was pleasantly surprised :) 




 I just saw it 2 days ago for the first time, and I am wishing I should have seen it earlier! 




 Yes, MU was great, but it wasn't up to Pixar's high standards. 




 I just love the Toy Story trilogy, I can never get enough of them. 




 Toy Story 3 is my favourite film ever, but Up was mind-blowing as well, and definitely one of my favourites. Inside Out looks very promising, and it looks like Pixar might finally be back on track. 




 Yup, Pixar's Toy Story trilogy, Finding Nemo, the Incredibles, Wall-E, Monsters, Inc. and A Bug's Life were amazing. Here's hoping the same for Inside Out! 




 I rewatched Wreck-It Ralph today, and it's really an amazing film. 




 The Toy Story trilogy. Even I am on an anmated movies watcing spree, and I have watched tons of them in the last few days.  









 Yes, enjoying last few moments of freedom! 




 Last day of vacations, just enjoying it :) 




 Very sleepy, 3.10 am here. 




 **WE DID IT REDDIT!** 




 Okay. 




 **HITLER IS AN APPROVED PROPHET!** 




 Yep XD 




 :O ??? 




 Where have you been? 




 Pete Docter. 




 Hi! Seeing you after some time :) 









 So... Did you buy it? 




 I found [Rapunzel](http://agoofyidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/rapunzel.jpg) from Tangled to be the most attractive.

Someone please x-post this to /r/Jokes. 




 "I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically."



Ladfrombrad is botfrombrad confirmed. 




 /u/trollabot ladfrombrad 




 I will surely see! 




 Yup, I haven't even seen any Hobbit films :( 




 I've never seen any LoTR movie... :( 




 It's a really good film, especially if you like Pooh. You should definitely watch it. I am currently watching a lot of Disney and Pixar films. 




 Winnie the Pooh (2011) :P It was a great film, though. 




 It's 1.30 am here, and the only things that I did today were cycling and watching a movie. 




 /uj Isn't this quiet like /r/AndroidMasterCard? 




 Yes! :D 




 First, you should **BuyANexus** 




 Thanks :) 




 I might try to order it now... I'll look for it on Amazon. 




 But not available anywhere in my country :( 




 I like blue colour! 




 I craving to see Spirited Away :( 




 Toy Story 3. 




 Yes, Lord DuARTe blesses everyone. 




 Mark as NSFW! 




 Diwali is the biggest festival in India, and the celebrations here are grand. It is like the Christmas here :) 




 MKBHD. 




 /uj I really lked the new sidebar image and thanks for the replacing of the submit button! 




 But... M = 1000! 




 I cannot fathom my heresy! I will whip myself 1000 times now and ask Lord DuARTe for forgiveness! 




 I should've have seen it earlier! 




 A Nexus 5 with KitKat? Damn, you're old.


Edit: Forgive me for my heresy. 




 It's just awesome! 




 The Nightmare Before Christmas? 




 Which one OS best


That guy's certainly not using Google Keyboard. 




 Yes, a big one! 




 Almost 6 PM here :) 




 Says the heretic who's trying to burn himself with an M9. 




 Though the Mumbai showed in the cartoon is far from the reality, I seriously love the new Mickey shorts! 




 **HITLER IS AN APPROVED PROPHET!** 




 But... but... they made the Nexus 9! 




 The MCG! It's too damn huge! 




 In most cases, yes :) 




 Yup. I know!  




 The current name is too hard too pronounce. Thiruvananthapuram. 




 I'm kinda used to it now! 




 Skyscrapers. 




 Yup, staple Indian food. 




 /uj Yes. I am a huge Pixar fan. 




 Yes! 




 True! 




 Mumbai. 




 Ummm... Probably Diwali holiday here in India... 









 All people in Chile are blessed. 




 I am just lazing around currently... 




 **BURN THE TREES!** 




 Hey, what's up? 




 10 AM here in India, and it's very sunny. 




 No Netflix in my country :( 




 Yes, Cars 1 wasn't good. The story was not sensible. 




 Blue inked! 




 I liked MU a lot, too, but it wasn't up to Pixar's standards
 Brave was an okay-ish kind of film. Cars 2 on the other hand... 




 Let's hope it would be good, there really hasn't been a good Pixar movie since Toy Story 3. 




 Here's the good dinosaur trailer, if you are interested :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1nfAxkpx9M 




 But I'm didn't really like the trailer of The Good Dinosaur. The dinosaurs look too goofy... 




 Adding the founder of iVerge to the list of Approved Prophets? **NEVER!** 




 Also, Finding Dory might ruin Finding Nemo, too. Inside Out looks very promising, though. 




 I think You are right. I am not really sure about it, let's hope Cars 3 comes after it! Also, they should scrap their plans of making Toy Story 4. The trilogy is almost perfect, they might ruin it with this one... 




 Cars 3 is coming before it :'( 




 It was 2017, but then delayed :( I am desperately waiting for The Incredibles 2, though :) 




 But the third is coming in 2018 :( 




 Even I did a back to back watch! It's amongst my favourite movies now! 




 The whole two new apps would be coming Soon  




 I watched How to Train Your Dragon 2 yesterday :)
