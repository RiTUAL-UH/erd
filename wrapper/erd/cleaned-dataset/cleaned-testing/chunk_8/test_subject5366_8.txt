 Like her mouth is sliding off. Imagine the confusion.  
 oh god is that the acid kicking in or just Lorde? 




 That's what they had in one of their earlier iterations though, which was scrapped when they started on voxel-craft.  
Daybreak is caught in a generation gap, developing a followup to two games released over a decade ago, yet trying to stay relevant to gamers today. It's a tough balance to not piss off your veterans and also be interesting enough for newbies.  
In the end, I think when they tossed their lot in with voxels as the means for detail (not just the land masses, etc) they painted themselves into a technical corner. Still today if you get a claim or so away from anything really detailed in Landmark it becomes a melty mess. I know they keep saying their working on that but I think it's one of their achilles heals, with the other being AI. 




 so, what is the deal with comments on imgur? 




 Really want a model of the Going Merry or the Thousand Sunny

 I know right, now you can't turn off updates at all, nor pick which updates you want. It's all or nothing baby... 




 It was through Windows Update, they pushed some updates a few months ago:

 Most home users aren't on a domain or have knowledge of group policies, but there is a "Prevent the usage of OneDrive for file storage" setting:  
You can use Group Policy Editor to modify the policies for specific services on your computer to disable OneDrive. 




 Since OneDrive is built into the operating system in Windows 8.1, you cannot uninstall it.  
Right, so the code still lives on in the system, and any new user created on the system will have it enabled for them. I'm sure that won't have an exploit /s 









 It is, but it's still obfuscated during setup.  
Also, most all of the embedded apps, including Cortana, will require a MS account to function.

 Well, yes,certain "apps" can't be uninstalled: onedrive, Skype, camera, maps, weather, etc. Apps that are deemed 'core' can't be, so that if a new user was created on the device they would be presented with the core apps, at a minimum, without having to download them.  
So its a toss up whether Candy crush will be uninstallable or just disable only and the code still sticks around for any new user to come along. 




 Poke-ception 




 So that's what the reset button does, dam you Hillary! 




 Candy crush for you! And you! and You!

 Or put your head in the sand and let whomever passes by inspect your derriere.  
The point is that there are alternatives, where the business model isn't based on advertising and giving away things to get you to freely give up your data.
