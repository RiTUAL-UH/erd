 You've allowed what others think of you to be offensive, instead of embracing it. You take power away when you hold it to your heart, not shun it away in disgust. You mention stereotypes over and over again, all I hear is lack of confidence from within. Embrace those ideas, they come from somewhere, and it's really, really funny once you stop caring about what others think of you.

 Let go 




 Art can most certainly be offensive. And you've allowed it to do such. But why? Does femininity scare you? Should all gay men be machismo? Should we ignore our history in drag, of Stonewall, of gender bending, of camp, of flamboyance, all for the prevalence of leading, dominating, and repressive heterosexual culture?

I think we have and do. 




 100%, you knew what I meant. 




 /r/gaybros called. 




 Holy shit, people, chill.

The bank does work with the local Pride parade. It's art for fun's sake.

It's hardly offensive, it's just fun. Also, it's in one of the most progressive cities on earth for gay rights. The bank, the city, the people have a history with LGBT culture.

...did I also mention it's just, like, art? 




 Yeah I wanted to post something from Temple Grandin, where she talks about dogs loving that small space, like a cave or a den (couldn't find a good direct quote off the inter webs). 

Though if someone did something to a beta dog in the past, like hurt the pup in a corner, or just ignore them in a kennel for hours and hours, we have to work in baby steps to regain the trust and go forward. Prettttttty sure you get that. Cool. 




 Sorry to hijack this thread too, but I just noticed the 'breed'.

Shibu Inus are high energy, been used for hunting small game for years. Chows, while not so energetic, definitely have a job. Protecting large spaces, patrolling. 

My siberian husky, similar spitz like mentality, strongly dislikes being constricted, limited in mobility. Even as a dog groomer, I muzzle him start to finish.

The only thing that calms him down, allowing me to man-handle him or put him in any size kennel I want? Exercise. A jerby-jerb. He get's out his 'husky drive', I don't have to deal with his anxiety. Just another idea... 




 Ouch. Yeah rescues can be tricky. You never know what they've been through in their past.

Have you tried baby steps? Gated area with you in the room. Good behavior? Treats. Make the gated area smaller. More treats. Work your way down. Good behavior means treats. Talking does little. Her flight or fight response has to be met with no acknowledgement. Baby steps to a kennel without you there.

I believe you're anthropomorphizing your dog. 




 Best snorkeling in Southern California, hands down.

When I was younger, I 'played' hide-and-seek with a harbor seal through a kelp forest.

Looking back, could of been eaten by a variety of sharks....

But back to the fish. Lot of garibaldi. Tons of parrot fish. Sea stars. Just colors, colors, colors. Spectacular.

 Wait what?!?! I feel like I need more of a back story. 














 Its weird seeing things from Facebook on this sub....

Not a gay or feminine innuendo, just a commonly used phrase in recovery, though i am gay, so I guess I could see the connection. Funny, never even thought of it like that. 




 I had a lot of difficulty socializing and handling stress in a healthy way my first.... pretty much 3 months.

You got some good ideas though! Exercise, MA meetings, prayer, meditation, drinking tons of water, not drinking caffeine or alcohol, all great things that have worked for some people!

I also liked having a creative outlet. I like poetry, personally. So I wrote a lot. Loud music. Playing with neighbors'  dogs. Eating my favorite foods. Sex with my boyfriend all the time (Idk i guess my sex drive came back 100 fold). Channels to move our emotions. Escapism, no. That's what our pot smoking was. This is giving our interests a chance to come back with the weird, awkward 'pink cloud' of the first 3 months.

It's a weird and kind of awesome time.

Mandatory, congrats on being sober! Woot woot!

 .... conservatives in the United States of America are typically said to be on the right end of the political spectrum. "rightist" if such a thing existed.

Edit: terrible website I linked, but those little graphs are used pretty consistent in many middle school, high school, and college level political science courses. 




 Yes, because their viewership is [primarily](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/14/five-facts-about-fox-news/) conservative. 




 More importantly, how is this a 

 funny, weird, sad, strange or quirky news that's just.... offbeat

... story?

Seems more like something on /r/funny. 




 I've been thinking this exact thing a lot lately. Simply nitpicking minor details, just like (s)he said. 




 Hey, internet stranger, nice to meet you too. 




 Beer and lemonade, that's all you need, man.  




 Dude I love Hoffbruhaus Mnchen! Such good weisswurst. 




 The Mighty Ducks (1992)

Edit: Cause I'm from Orange County, and I would just freak out at every game because I expected the movie stars to actually be on the ice. Child me was very guilible.  




 In terms of mental stability, yes. It's easier getting and keeping a job. Socializing is a super normal now. I get most of my cravings now when i watch weed related media, but those cravings are very weak and far and in-between. Relationships, character defects, familiar issues, these are always reoccurring for me, and it's more on a day to day basis.

 MA's app. It's got chat rooms if you're a little scared to go to a 'land' meeting, but still want to chat with stoners who don't smoke pot. It's got meeting schedules for your district. It's got daily reflections and prayers. Pot-free time calculator. It's basically my life line. 




 "Noice is my thang, no more noice from you, ok?" 









 The dog needs to be fixed for one. 

Two, it's cruel. Dogs and wolves should never be mixed. 

Let's go with with three, there are far too many dogs in the world. 




 sadly, euthanasia.  




 Spotted a male Romanian mioritic shepherd dog at a coffee shop. I only know this cause the owner told me about his breed history and personal story.

He flew to California on AirFrance from Transylvania. His brothers are herding dogs (this will be an important detail in a bit.) He hates squirrels with a passion, but instead of biting them, he bats them like baseballs with his monster paws.

In Romania, he has three brothers (probably more but the breeder keeps three males). The brothers are raised together with the herder, the flock, and a donkey. The donkey is sometimes the first line of defense from bears and wolves. If the donkey is attacked by a bear, the brothers get in formation. Two brothers will distract the bear by barking and swiping their paws. The third brother will sneak from behind and attack the bear's back legs. This could go on for hours, with the bear then running away, never messing with said flock again.

As the owner was telling me this story in a thick Transylvanian accent, the dog was circling me, he was working me. So cool. 




 I think she's a mutt and not any breed.

But that aside, I see Australian cattle dog for sure. 




 Hopefully your wiki-ity roof doesn't leak. 




 I don't know... I broke the lightbulb after I threw the first one. 




 That's fucking beautiful, mate. 

"So shines a good deed in a weary world." 




 That you are two completely separate people with two different sets of beliefs, opinions, and personalities. I feel like I'm constantly telling my friends (who are in the early stages of a relationship) to be more accepting of their partner. If they want to keep a Grindr profile, that's their deal, not yours. If they don't want to go to church, that's their deal. If they think your brother is a self righteous douche-nozzle, then that's their opinion and you have to respect it.

Honesty and trust. All boils down to those two. 




 Oh no worries man. No I totally get what you mean. At first I thought the use of the word lesbian was a bit over the top, but with your explanation it makes sense.

I wanted to add that gender and sexual orientation are two separate things, but I'm sure you already understand that. (Like her idea of the male/female is different than her attraction to women)

Thanks man!

 It's a petral. They commonly eat carcasses. 




 Is this an albatross (Another edit: Petral)? I think I posted one here too.

Edit: [I did! I even gave the specific epithet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/2ntu2a/bon_apptit_macronectes_halli/) 




 I'm kind of in love. You can haunt me any time ;) 




 As a jew, I can't think of many things I find creepier than the thought of my relatives slowly rotting away from disease and starvation. I ask my grandfather, "what happened to your *blank*" The answer is usually the same. They died. Horrifically. All traces of their existence tore off this earth. I don't think I've cried as hard watching something as I've cried watching the footage from American soldiers shot in Germany at a concentration camp. Watching germans pile bodies in to holes. The look of apathy in their eyes. The jews trying to walk to get water, thinner than sticks. Those were my people. They were my blood. "Never again" is what my grandfather told me, and he is so right. Never again. 




 I forgot to say that too. Pretty sure they all found out eventually... right? Maybe?

 




 *DAMNIT* 




 Chris, you showed me how inexperienced in life I was. Thanks. I shouldn't think about you anymore, but I do.

Kory? I was crazy. I fucked up. You helped me get to that level, but in reality only have myself to blame. Hopefully, someday, you'll be able to date another guy. I think you'll be happier that way.

Any one else? You'll never be any of the three men that matter in my life. Those two, and my partner now, the greatest man in the world.

Edit: I wish we could of all been friends.

 Is it true Atreyu went to Trabuco Hills? I lived right next to that goddamn school, yet had to drive 20 minutes to Tesoro. I'm so jealous of people that went there.

You should be good to go. 




 I sort of knew that reading your tifu. Struggle is real in Coto hahaha 









 WEIRD. Cause that's where I'm from. LMV wha whaaaaa. 




 Ha, I linked that pic a few days ago to the whole Jenny and Carly fiasco in TIFU.

That episode is the first thing that came to mind. 




 I don't know...  I grew up in south OC, and there aren't many black people. Large Japanese, latino, Vietnamese, Armenian, and Persian communities, but not a lot of black folk. I always heard it sucked being black in south OC cause of the 'polite' racism.

I know it sucked being a gay jew, but that's just personal experience... 




 That's another thing, you don't eat it. You put it in your mouth, alive, then let it shoot it's spray. Wild, I know, but so delicious. 




 I was told by a local guide there to put the bug in my mouth, KEEP IT ALIVE, shake my mouth letting it spray, then gently  releasing it back in to the leaf litter where it lived. 

Some sort of stink bug, but I want to know specifically what species. Tonto National Forest. 




 No, more like the stink bugs someone else posted, and I shit you not, it shot out delicious Big Red spray. 




 Without going in to too many details, I was guided by a local to pick up a specific stink bug or shield bug. I was then instructed to place the bug in my mouth (alive). The insect released a chemical that tasted EXACTLY like Big Red. I've been on the search for the binomial nomenclature ever since, as my guide just nick named them 'cinnamon bugs'. 

Habitat: Leaf litter near stream beds and riparian forests.

Size? Color?: Not exceptional large, I believe it was either all brown/tan/patterned, though it may have had red markings.

Any ideas? 




 For the rest of his life.

 I want to apologize for fast food. Cause it's hit us like a drug storm in a sober mormon town. A lot of us are fat, I don't know if you know that. And with rising GDP in previously 'under-developed' countries, it's going to hit you guys too. So we're all going to be fat. Our only hope is Colorado, and they're so high, soon, they're all going to be fat. So we're all fat fucked.

 My partner and I just want the same things that straight couples have, and we don't want faulty religious law to get in the way of living our lives. I really hope they make the right decision on this. In G-d we trust. 




 Yeah I agree with a lot of this. I came out when I was 18 (24 now), and my life has only become better from there.

All the out people i knew as a child were celebrities, and not exceptionally talented or intellectual at that. My, how times have changed. 









 Thanks for being open, at least here. btw sick username. 









 I know this is from 2013.... but....

 Hello! I'm sorry for the late reply but Facebook doesn't alert me of all the comments posted on the pictures 

 Thank you so much for your interest in my work, I'm very glad you like it.
At the moment I don't have prints or originals available for sale, I'm planning on having some art prints soon, I'll post it on this page and let you know when I have them ready. Thank you again, have a great weekend!

 Yea that'd be cool. I wasn't even aware there was a pride. Ventura, I'm guessing?

It'd be sick to get everyone together to go to the Moorpark Zoo, or meet up at a wildlife sanctuary. Is neon bowling still a thing? Hike to that waterfall in Newbury Park. Some ideas.
