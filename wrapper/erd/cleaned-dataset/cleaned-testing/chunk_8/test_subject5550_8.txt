 Bullshit editorialized title. Ukraine may never have been serious about the ceasefire, but no way in Hell did the FM suggest that. He says they're preparing for full-scale war **because** Putin is crazy, not that they signed a ceasefire for shits and giggles...

"We see that they are not stopping," he says, suggesting the fight was now heading south to the port of Mariupol. "It doesn't take a genius to see what they are trying to do. They are taking more and more strategic points." The former ambassador was in the room during the attempts to broker a political solution with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Minsk. "Personally I don't trust him," he says. "You look at him and you think, 'Are you serious?'" "Nobody knows what is going on in his head. I believe he is becoming very emotional [over the two countries' historic ties]," he suggests, calling Putin's intentions "difficult to predict." 




 Same thing - in a lot of these smaller grocery stores, it makes sense for somebody to wait out and just get your order. The closest thing I've seen in the West is in the US convenience stores will close their doors at night but you can order through a bullet proof window - you still have to get out of your car so not as awesome. Also, more for security than comfort I suppose. 




 I came here to say just that. I've seen people fail lie detectors telling objective truths. I've seen people pass lie detector tests when telling objective falsehoods. 




 It should be like the American Civil War; even though the other side consisted of Confederates and had broken their oaths to the Union, they were still treated in a civil manner for the most part when captured, because they were still Americans.

 According to what I've read, islamic law changes dramatically when a Caliphate is declared.

Islamic law isn't really affected by leaders, the legal precepts come from Muslim jurists. The basics of Islamic law fall into a spectrum of acceptable opinions (to mainstream Sunni Muslims) and deviations. A caliphate may pick and choose from different parts of the legal tradition, but they don't actually themselves have an effect on the law (in theory). 




 You get a lot of people to listen to your point-of-view ~~by~~ **in spite of** using vitriolic language like that?

There's a regular generalization of this sub as a cess-pool of antisemitism due to suspicious posters (Indara-Varuna, etc.), deliberate and self-professed conspiritard trolls (Bip0lar bear, etc.) and the mouth-breathing basement dwellers working tirelessly to discredit the sub as a whole (duck_vimes, etc.). Your post, whether intentional or not, sets up a scarecrow argument, completely ignores the substance of the post made by the person you responded to and alludes to that absurd assertion of some sort of dominant anti-semetic trend across the sub.

Was I a dick? Sure - a blunt, a few beers and the blessing of relative anonymity don't bring out my best side. Does it take away from my 'point-of-view'? I don't think so. 




 Our policy has been largely successful, after we arrest these young people we bring a group of young scholars to engage in dialogue with them about their thoughts, and we succeed to bring a lot of them back from their radical ideas, he added.

 If you're scared of Jews running things

So that's what raw, unadulterated retardation sounds like huh? Idiot. The OP asserted that there may be an Israel bias in administration at the site. The post you're replying to asserted that Reddit is presently owned by a Jewish billionaire. A majority of self-proclaimed Jews would identify with some sort of affinity or understanding towards Israel.

His post is an on point observation providing elucidating facts, yours is a desperate attempt to paint the presentation of facts as anti-semitism. 




 In my area, PDs have completely gotten *rid* of dash cams. It's fucked - 




 Some of em are - hear about the several cops that would place drugs on people they'd stopped? They had hand signals and everything. 




 Alleged petty criminals (usually poor people) don't typically go after the media outlets that paint them as monsters. Police departments however, can. In many ways given that reporters often depend on these guys for local stories. 




 Agreed. We need to stop having the cities dole out millions of dollars and start punishing the cops if we actually want change. 




 No - morally speaking, it's disgusting. Legally, not recording yourself committing a crime isn't akin to 'evidence tampering' (destroying evidence of your crime after the fact). Ipso facto, they can turn off the camera before beating someone senseless - but they can not destroy the tape in the event that they forgot to turn off the camera...though it's not like these tapes don't tend to go missing... 




 That's so incredibly fucked up especially given that these caffeinated beverages have the exact opposite effect on a person's hydration. I'm gonna be sick. 




 I can't think of a better reason to despise Castro, can you?

You despise Castro. We get that. I didn't take issue with that. I took issue with you painting a picture of *actual* Cubans by and large despising Castro with literally zero evidence. 









  Castro is (rightfully) despised by Cubans.

 He's Dutch - it's a Dutch accent. 




 Well, that's convenient. 




 It's not a reference to the original crusade. They call any Christian who opposes them a Crusader. 




  I'm not sure what do you mean by 'better'.

TBF - he's saying the new govt is better for non-Muslims since Morsi wasn't able to control the localized Copt/Muslim conflicts while the current govt is. 




 The reason the Japanese and Jordanian death created such an emotional reaction was because they made us first think there was hope for their survival. That there was an exchange. Its like a plot twist to make us angry. 

TBF, there actually is always hope for survival. They're like any other criminal gang, when the price is paid, they've let go of hostages in numerous cases (more times than they've killed hostages). In the case of Jordan, you might not be aware that during negotiations, Jordan allegedly ran a (failed) operation to save the hostage. I have a feeling that played a substantial role in what took place. As a specific example, you might note that the American woman they were holding hostage (who died in a Jordanian operation post execution of the pilot) explicitly mentioned her peers being freed (they delivered that letter we all saw).

Currently they're holding a fuck-ton of Peshmerga as hostages and they're in talks about a trade with the Kurds. I'm willing to bet that those Peshmerga hostages will get traded for the ISIS hostages being held by the Kurds as the Kurds don't have that same mentality of 'we don't negotiate with Terrorists' and though our (US) advisers will probably discourage it, they'll make the deal to save their loved ones. 




 They are obviously still upset about the previous crusades though.

I don't think so, there's plenty of modern issues to be upset about. The use of 'crusade' is entirely symbolic, the same way Bush referred to it as a 'Crusade' on one occasion as have other Christians in the military. It's not a reference to the original Crusade which no Christian I've known is particularly proud of - just a symbolic phrase.

They are always talking about killing the Pope and conquering rome.

Killing the pope? That's a mistranslation at best - what video did they say that in? When these guys reference "ar-Rum", it's not a reference to Rome proper in Italy or to the Vatican - it's historically been a general reference to "The West". Today - it's a reference to US hegemony / NATO / Allied powers. It's like when in medieval times, Europeans referred to Muslims as "Saracens" - it didn't mean the Saracens proper but Muslims in general.

My two cents - If we want to know what these people's grievances are objectively (something we need to do if there's ever going to be a lasting peace), I don't think its smart to write things off as an 'age-old' desire for revenge. In their statements, they don't say they're avenging the barbarity of the old Crusades - like ever. They particularly speak about activity that took place over the last 50 years and certain conditions that persisted into the modern age. 




 Wow, so they killed all these people just because some lady was forced to go back to the Christian church? Don't they do this shit all day in Saudi Arabia?

She was also [purportedly tortured at some point.](http://www.thecairopost.com/news/137567/uncategorized/sisi-egypt-has-right-to-respond-to-is-execution-of-egyptians-in-libya)

 They could probably actually have some sort of Islamic State if they weren't so psychotic.

Yea - probably. Doesn't seem like the end game of the leadership though.

I love how obsessed ISIS is with the crusades. I wonder if they realize that most of the western world doesn't even care about the pope. They can't get over some event that happened like 800 years ago.

When they talk about Crusade, they're referring to modern wars - not the actually Crusades or Papal authority.

 




 I'm surprised this isn't receiving much attention.

I'm not. 




 It has something to do with the ice-grip they've got on our balls. 




 even the cats over there aren't shocked by the senseless violence anymore. 




 Yea because the media always puts out speculative news pieces about motive only after a jury convicts several years after an incident..... 




 Gotta kill as many civilians as possible before the ceasefire comes into effect! Get with the program! 




 It has now - because people campaigned for it....it didn't get picked up by any mainstream outlet till 14 hrs after the fact.... 




 was there some evidence that it was motivated by their religion?

Testimony of the father of a victim (ignored by police), the fact that he executed 3 people for the parking dispute with one person (the driver), other inconsistencies with the police insistence that this is just a simple parking dispute and thats that etc. 




 No - they haven't. They hit mainstream media after the hashtag campaign - CNN (the first mainstream outlet to pick it up) did so 14 hrs after the fact. The comparison is being made to the recent Ottawa killing, or the axe-attack, etc. One type of issue (this one) was getting no attention and even later, only sanitized reporting, while the others were dramatic, immediate and full-day without a massive public campaign....

 Not surprising. A guy flew a plane into an IRS building. I don't recall it even making national news at the time. There have been Mosque arsons, unexploded bombs, etc. in the past as well with no coverage. 




 The police have the shooter in custody, so he's not a threat anymore.

Ah yes, that's why it isn't making front page. Once somebody is arrested, its not news anymore. Got it.

 It's not "tolerant" of other beliefs to deny Christ's statement that he is the only way to Heaven (as attributed to him in the Bible) - it's just denial of canon... 




 As a rule - yes. But Muslims can't say "so and so" non-Muslim is in Hell. Islam differentiates between a general statement ('anyone who commits shirk goes to the fire') vs a specific statement about an individual (so and so is in the fire because so and so committed shirk). 




 It's pretty obvious Jordan killed her accidentally. If ISIS did it - they would have a well-produced twisted video of it. Their story is pretty believable in this situation. 




 It is. The issue is that media is selective in "trying to understand". In certain cases, no such attempt is made and a rush to conclusions is the drivel you generally get. In other cases, there is an "attempt to understand". 




 It's appropriate for the US to supply cold war era weapons for the new cold war. 




 But that doesn't make for good TV! 




 I'm afraid you're just an idiot and this is an urban myth concocted by little hicks with too much free time, internet and a nominal understanding of Islam. Being "tainted" with pigs blood doesn't make it impossible for a Muslim to be martyred (according to Islam). All it does is affect the living (making them ritually unclean requiring them to wash up before prayer). 




 They were suspended. Which suggests anonymous didn't actually take them down, Twitter did. 




 Yes, but they won't use abc123 as a password anymore if Anonymous really took down a bunch of these accounts as is being claimed.

 The Tanakh is clear Sodom was destroyed for inhospitality.

BS - it's clear from any objective read that the issue here was homosexuality, as it was clear to the Jews and their sages, who historically interpreted the story as a basis for the prohibition of male homosexuality.

 That was my immediate thought. My follow-up thought was that the people likely to break the law in retaliation to getting butt-fucked like this are the untethered single individuals with few future prospects in life and no dependents. Which leads me to believe that the people these guys are screwing over tend to be the exact people who can't retaliate - people with families that will just need to get over it, move on and get screwed by someone else in the near future.

 That's not really true though. Content surrounding conspiracy theories that were massively upvoted have often been proven correct (Israeli military training of US police forces, widespread domestic spying, use of tools by police to intercept cell-phone data, police provocation at protests,...and this current thread). There's bound to be plenty of non-sensical threads with 10-20 upvotes or what-not, but if you go through the wayback machine and simply compare the most upvoted content against later determined facts, it doesn't seem to be a sea of crazy. 




 Why isn't there more on Mo from these unbiased sources?

Most of the tribes in Arabia at the time converted to Islam, within Muhammad's life time and the succeeding generations. If everybody is on your team by the time you die - then all sources that talk about you would logically be 'biased' sources no?

There is some material from biased non-Muslim sources as well - you can start [here](http://www.islamic-awareness.org/History/Islam/Inscriptions/earlysaw.html) and then consult the voluminous literature around the early community used in the references. 




 Every historical report in recorded human history then is just hearsay...

Ahadith are just saying attributed to the man, there's way of verifying the credibility of reports. Kinda like what historians do....

 100 lashes in Singapore. Not 100 lashes in Saudi Arabia:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw 




 He is putting effort into it - he's doing exactly what Saudi/Islamic law permits for lashing (90 degree arm angle maximum, not striking the same spot twice in a row, no more than 100 at a time, no breaking the skin, etc.) 




 Flogging in Saudi Arabia is always public. It would be very difficult to list it as suicide. It also doesn't depend on who's doing it (in Saudi Arabia) since all the administrators need to follow the same rules. 




 The king doesn't directly control the judiciary. 




 You're thinking of the wrong kind of lashes. These are lashes in accordance with Saudi law:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw 




 It's 10x the amount given out per session. But they're not administered at once, he'll see 50 per week. 




 1000 lashes like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw

Spread out over the course of 50 per week. 




 Those *are* the norm for Saudi Arabia. That's literally all the lasher is allowed to do (90 degress, no hits on the same spot twice in a row, not allowed to break skin, etc.) 




 [It's not as bad as you think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw) - you'd probably easily be able to take one. 




 I think [you'd be fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw) 




 You're thinking of Singapore canings. This is what Saudi lashing looks like:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw 




 No. His lawyer argued that he needed it put off while his family wrote to the press. His lashing was identical:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw

And all the lashings in Saudi Arabia follow the same guideline (the administrator of the punishment is subject to the courts for overdoing the religious restrictions on how its to be done). 




 It's not, Islam stipulates rules for lashings. Here's Badawi's punishment for the week of Jan 9th:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw 




 true:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw 




 As somebody else clarified - I should've said twice in a row.

I got caned two strokes at school for splitting someones lip and the bloody housemaster managed to cross the strikes being the sadistic fuck he was.

 A forum for gay minors. So...'An underage boys gay site.' 




 Much of the rest of the world, beyond the Americas and Europe is pretty "anti gay". Historically, much of the West was also "anti gay". Times change of course 




 He is alleged to have specifically and seriously libeled one of two of the major academic institutions of Saudi Arabia - there's a reason CNN will mention the flogging but you won't find anyone actually discussing the blog posts. The change he (and some other young Saudis like him) was petitioning for is increased secularization, but more importantly, an overhaul of the academic and judicial system in Saudi.

By making this a big international issue (which is what he and his family have been doing - since seeking asylum - through the medical claim, etc.) - the regime will have to step in and over-rule the judiciary. The hope is (in addition to his case being overturned) that there will be a precedent set for greater 'freedom of expression', that will include being allowed to make the sort of claims he did about Saudi establishments.

An unintended consequence though is that an action by the ruler in favor of Badawi could stoke tensions within the kingdom. In Islamic law, there has always been a seperation between the judicial system and the executive role. So when Muslim leaders had a dispute with the populace, they had to be judged by an independent third party. When a judge has a dispute with a citizen, they go to another judge. And religion, in theory, places enough fear in the judges from taking sides because so-and-so is a peer or a friend.

You can see exactly what 'lashes' are in Saudi Arabia as somebody snuck a camera during his Jan 9th lashing. Unless he has some sort of critical condition, at 32 years of age, he can definitely take the caning and did just fine during his first lashing. Regardless of what we might think about the Saudi judicial system [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcYK3xqcAEY) isn't exactly some kind of tortuous punishment. It's arguably a lot less painful than some of the things that happen in our own penitentiaries.

And the administrators of corporal punishment in Saudi Arabia also have rules to abide by so it doesn't actually get more 'brutal' than this. You can't go more than 90 degrees with your arm, you can't hit the same spot twice in a row, you're not allowed to break the skin, etc. The shame associated with the punishment has a more powerful effect (except for this guy) then the physical aspect.

That said, I'm not saying I agree with happened - just clarifying that the images most people have of these punishments outside of Muslim circles is more based on surreal superstitions and hypotheses absent actual context. Hopefully that was helpful. 




 just that as Jesus said, let he who has not sinned cast the first stone.

Hate to be that guy - but Jesus didn't actually say that. The popular passage was actually a centuries later interpolation (and that's if we can truely regard much of the Bible what 'Jesus said') 




 You might. Saudis don't (look at their crime rate), they also have other dissuading factors like shame. 




 It's in the comments slightly above. It's interesting though how many people without any knowledge of Islam or Saudi law jump (reasonably) to the same false conclusion that you did. 




 Maybe his really were brutal?

They probably weren't and medically he's probably fit. But you don't create social change by being honest to gullible foreigners. 




 Saudis are the barbarians while we send kids to get their ass pounded. 




  there might be much worse approaches, depending on the crime and person.

There isn't. You don't go more than 90 degress and you don't hit the same spot twice. Only thing to make it worse would've been if he had to take his shirt off (which is plausible). 




 He still has really bad scars on his back almost 20 years later and told me it was fucking excruciatingly painful FAR worse than you'd imagine.

Lashes are different depending on where you go. In Saudi Arabia, they aren't (technically) allowed to pull their arm all the way back and then lash. They aren't allowed to go more than 90 degress. So he wouldn't die, or even scar - its more about slight pain and plenty of humiliation. 




 Oh, well that's not too trippy - I guess you lucked out, I've seen some weird shit. 




 Open the ta'weez and see what is written inside (assuming you're Desi). You may be in for an unpleasant surprise. 




 It's comical. Unless you're American. Than it just becomes sad.

 Shhhhh 




 You can't blame Bibi for trying - not like we haven't been doing their bidding for years. 




 and the torture

Interestingly, besides the senate report on torturey stuff that we've done - the Extremists aren't actually known for torture. There's no veritable evidence, or propaganda video by them where they actually torture someone. Our allies have plenty of videos like that (the Iraqi army), but the other crazy guys don't. 




 sure 




 Muslims believe it's real. Muslims also believe in angels, so this thing isn't really a stretch.

If we suppose that Muhammad fabricated the entire incident though, it's a bit interesting that he would choose an insignificant sounding animal the size of a 'mule' and not something a little cooler like a dragon. 




 Well he didn't actually get to lead a rebellion against Yazid, even if that was his intention. He was killed before that was even a plausible possibility. 




 Those are just artist renderings. But Muslims do believe that during isra, there was an animal called Buraq which the Prophet rode. 




 Sure - just don't say it in public out of respect for the living who suffered under some of those rulers. Pray for them all you want in private. 




 The people in charge need another old figurehead. May God forgive the Kings. 




 There actions are still documented...the Islamic pov is just not to insult/attack people when they're dead. 




 No. He was Muslim for all intents and purposes. There is no veritable evidence for takfir. 




 IT IS HARAM TO REBEL AGAINST **MUSLIM** RULER. Those are words of Prophet Muhammad!

100% agree with the statement, you respect the ruler even if he's a Khariji Muslim who took power by force. But as for Assad - He's a Rafidi, and an Alawi Rafidi to boot...

I dare you. Go and make revolution in USA or Morocco and see how government will react. YOU WILL BE KILLED too if you will fight the government with froce.

So you're telling me if a group of people took up positions, with weapons and threatened government officials in the USA or Morocco, those leaderships would annihilate that entire group of people (women and children and all) - for the sake of shutting down one rally? And then allow the country to be torn apart by civil war? 




 If a significant portion of an ethnic population in your country ascribed itself to a particular religion, in exclusion to the religion of your own majority ethnic group, and you attacked the icons of their religion (and thereby them) - it's not a leap to draw racism, and at the least, xenophobia...

By your logic, most Stormfront material wouldn't even be racist since apparently in order to implicate racism we need something explicit only. 




 Terrorist attacks are not logical, sorry.

Sorry, you're an idiot. He's saying it's logical for the perps to be Muslim in Muslim countries given that Muslims are the majority in Muslim countries. It's statistics - but you might want to start with a more basic use of numbers before we journey into the world of probabilities and what-not.
