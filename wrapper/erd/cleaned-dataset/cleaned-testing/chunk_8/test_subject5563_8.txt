 If they were to cancel it, I would want CBS to let the creators give the show a proper send off and finish off all the story points. However I don't want the show to end because it's just too good, hopefully Netflix picks it up and ups the budget (one can dream, can they not?) 




 Can you remember his main criticism of the film? 









 Cool thanks guys! 




 So throughout the series, corporations are obviously a big part of the game and in Human Revolution they go into greater detail of these different corporations, which i'm guessing are loosely based of real life corporations who have monopolies in certain markets. 

1. Tai Yong Medical, could we align them to real life companies like Pfizer or Glaxo Smith Kline?

2. Picus Media, perhaps they are based off News Corp, Comcast, Viacom? 

2. Belltower Associates, this one is pretty straightforward as we can attribute them security contractors like Academi (formally known as Blackwater) or DynCorp

3. Sarif Industries, This one for me is harder to pinpoint, it seems to be an amalgamation of different real life companies put into one company. Maybe Boston Dynamics or maybe Cyberdyne (yes that is the real name of a Japanese robotics company, I am worried).

What do you guys think, I may be completely off here.  




 This, from what I gathered in my play-through, Sarif Industries were more on the cutting edge of augmentations than their competitor, Tai Yong Medical which were known for making more generic/cheaper augmentations that weren't as reliable.  




 Hey there visiting Singapore next week for a few days, I was thinking of watching the Avengers there since it releases the day I leave Sydney on the 23 April. Would the movie have subtitles on the whole film and would it be censored in any form? Also where is the best cinema to watch it?

Thanks 




 Damn that looks nice, I think it saw it during the day last time, never to to see it at night, will definitely check it out, thanks! 




 Hey guys I am visiting from Sydney, Australia and I will be arriving on the 23 April and checking the place out for a few days, can anyone recommend a place to take some good photos, especially at night time (neon lights etc). Last time in Singapore I only had a day to check out the city, so this time I will be able to venture around a bit more.

Cheers.  




 So will we see Malick in Mankind Divided? Is it canon that she dies in Human Revolution? Be cool if you can make some quick decisions before Mankind Divided (like Mass Effect 2) and those decisions affect the story and characters in MD.  




 I truly do wonder if we will get to see Hengsha again in MD. Or maybe upper Hengsha, since that was already planned before it got cut. 




 He means [HBO Now](https://order.hbonow.com/), which is a subcription based service (no cable proivider needed). At the moment it is only available on the USA iTunes/Apple TV.  




 All of my Driveclub ones are taken as the menu fades in lol, is there anyway to turn the screenshot option off? 




 There's still a chance he may direct this if his one doesn't work out.  




 I thought Tress FX in Tomb Raider worked quite well, especially on my R280X, the only issue with the game was that it was only Lara's hair which had Tress FX while every other character in the game had the standard hair which looked even worse in comparison.  




 Sorry but I have to disagree, just because HBO's subscription method is a bit much (although they are releasing a standalone subcription only service soon), the quality of content they produce is still unsurpassed, no other network makes shows as remotely close to quality and production as Game of Thrones, The Wire, Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire. Those are just a few shows as well. If they were to budget this show like Game of Thrones than you would probably see the most realised vision of Rapture or Infinite on television.  




 Glad to see they are making a sequel, although the story for the first one was generic, the racing itself was amazing. Awesome camera-work with minimal CG.  




 Great idea, didn't think of this. Lends itself much better to TV this way than a straight up adaptation.  




 Gonna miss these guys, I never got to see them live :( 




 Hopefully Daft Punk will be able to score Tron 3 since they have finished their work on Random Access Memories.  




 So the film adaptation for Bioshock 1 got shut down a while ago now, how do you guys think the story of Bioshock 1 or Inifite would work as a TV series? Ideally it would be awesome to have a HBO budgeted series but I can understand the high risk involved with that. If it was Bioshock 1, should it be set before the events of the first game and show Rapture's downfall? Or do you guys think Bioshock Infinite's overall story lends itself to a television series better?  




 I guess some people prefer the convenience of being able to move have it on tablets/laptops without the hassle of discs, however for me the Blu-Rays are more than perfect due to the audio and video fidelity.  




 Can someone explain how they score the music to the film playing on the projector? 




 Quantum of Solace also had a cool opening chase, it's a shame the rest of the film didn't hold up as well though.  




 This is what I believe as well, makes sense as GG are going to focus on their new game and potentially turn it into a franchise, hope it's great as they are a very talented group, who have unfortunately been relegated to making Killzone titles since the PS3 launched. With the writer of Fallout NV, I do have high hopes for the story of Horizon.  




 It auto mutes the music for me in Driveclub, I have also heard it does it in Bloodborne as well.  




 I actually haven't seen this played before any films, at least in my theatre, is it because it is too intense? 




 It's kinda strange because that soundtrack must have been ahead of its time for that type of film, back then people may not have been able to comprehend not having a conventional orchestral score in a heist type of film, Tangerine Dream also did the score for GTA V and sounds very similar to Thief [Here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MKvsXA94Zk).  




 Curious as to what you liked about 2 over 1? 




 I think the 2014 noses were by far the worst I have seen.  




 I love this one in particular for the splash of red and the pattern it forms around the car, it's a shame that Toyota weren't more successful in F1 considering how much money they put into it:( I'm also a big fan of the sail fin era, gave the cars a more futuristic look in my opinion.  









 What type of spider is this? 




 3576142 




 Bioshock 1 written into a good movie with a talking protagonist. Which then ties into a Bioshock Infinite film.  









 She had like a 3 second cameo after Letty wins the race at the start of the movie.  




 Man this guy does not deserve the POS car Red Bull have this year, he deserves so much better. 




 So basically if a human had sex with a female twi-lek could it produce offspring?  




 The pacing felt a bit off and the end action sequence felt a little uninspired and ran too long, but other than that I enjoyed it for what it was considering that it went through a pretty big reshoot after Paul's death. The ending for the film was really nice and fitting. Nicely ties off the series with these characters.  




 To be fair Azog's CGI is pretty damn impressive as well, it's just shame that it's only him and Smaug that look good while everyone else looks passable at best.  




 Well then there could be the case of BF4 where because they didn't really have a proper closed/open beta before release, the game ends up suffering and takes a full year to fix.  




 I feel they should have gone makeup instead of CG on Azog. Manu would have really gotten the ability to show off his acting in that capacity.  




 Driveclub muted the music for me. At least the main menu music as I already had the racing music option turned off.  




 The only ones I own are GTA V and The Last of Us. For me both of those games are what a HD Remasters should strive to be.  




 I think it's too early to say, yes Fernando must be feeling very bad about having to retire, especially since he was in a good position, however he is also smart enough to have foreseen that a great deal of work will be required to make this car into a magnificent car. It will take time, it won't be easy but I have a feeling the struggle will be worth it.  




 Do you guys think that FO4's main character should have a voice or be silent like previous entries? I see an upside and downside to this. 

Upside: Greater character development and more immersive for the player (at least for me). 

Downside: More voice work will limit the amount of dialogue choices and the character may not be likeable for every player. 

What do you guys think? 




 So people have answered with the usual responses. I think for a much more recent teaser, the Spectre teaser really is awesome. So little is revealed about the film yet it manages to totally keep you engaged and guessing.  




 I've seen a motorbike here in Sydney with the license plate of Bort as well.  




 Paracel Storm in night would make an interesting map.  




 Who is the guy in the back? I don't remember him at all. 




 I don't think Admiral Ackbar would be considered a "extremely minor character", right?  




 [Fembot](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Fembots_2_APIMOM.jpg) 




 Man I loved that guy. He always put a smile on my face, really uplifting dude.  




 Would Bossk and IG-88 be considered minor characters anymore since they got fleshed out in EU material?  




 I think it's because Pete is a major douche nozzle so it didn't bother me as much. I didn't think of GOT until OP reminded me haha 




 Easily a [Chiss](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Chiss). Blue skin and red eyes, I think I could make that work.  




 I'm hoping to see [death stick guy](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Elan_Sel%27Sabagno) again. I want to see if he re-thunk his life.  




 You can always mute it and put your own music. 




 I wonder how long that Maybach has been sitting there.  




 WHY did you have to bring up that traumatic experience OP? 




 It's too bad she was a fembot the whole time :( 




 They weren't attempts, as they were very successful.  




 [Mozambique Drill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique_Drill) is what Cruise did on the second hostile.  




 Fucking agent smith, I love this gif so much. 




 Damn haha, well here in Sydney it's a different story it's speed camera central. Just this morning I was driving through a road close to the city which had two red light speed cameras one set of lights apart.  




 Seriously? 




 Ah man I remember hearing original version of this song when I was very young, still stuck with me to this day. Still holds up and still means a lot to me.  




 Doubt it, since Sony is the publisher of the game, the chances of it happening are nil. 




 I don't play the game that often but why the hell is it updating every single day? Also not to mention it takes ages to actually apply the update since it's writing to disk all the time.  




 A question to people who avoid trailers, what exactly do you do when they show the trailer when you are watching a film in the cinema? 




 What spoilers were there in the Interstellar trailer? All I gathered from the trailers was that the earth was slowly dying and the main character had to go into space to try save it.  




 I have always liked [this tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ISrDM3hZYM) he did for Harry Potter Deathly Hallows Pt II. Dude's talented glad he has the opportunity to score a Star Wars film! 




 Everyone was pretty lukewarm on it since they first announced it. Not to mention it's a full launch price for a game that looks like it could have been sold as DLC.  




 The Tron Legacy one is my favourite. Seeing that logo appear the first time was awesome.  




 Haha believe me I know, I'm an example. 




 I did not expect that asian anchor to have that accent.  




 Pretty sure The Grey tops all of these. 




 I think the main issue with that is post procedure you may not be able to wear a helmet for a while...which may impede on his ability to race lol 




 This must have been quite excruciating for the actors to sit through, but the end product is perfect.  




 So I watched the first season of the show and seemed to enjoy it for what it was however I did watch it though when nothing else was on so it was rather a distraction until everything else started back up again. I was wondering how the second season is? Is it worth reinvesting the time to watch the show again? 




 To be fair I have been making use of the usb music feature for that until Spotify arrives. 




 Bond's Aston Martin DB5...*I need it* 




 Haha these were taken at least a year or 2 ago when I was still at uni, it was more of a thing to show my friends since it always happened to be in the same area. 




 Yep 




 2003 one wasn't terrible though in my opinion, I still found it enjoyable.  




 There are some mysteries in the universe that can never be explained.  









 I agree! I still find the second film to be quite good, just had quite a lot to live up to since it's a sequel to one of the greatest animes ever made.  




 Well fans were just being rowdy because because it was an offside goal by the Wanderers which led to the keeper and his own player running to each other I believe. Fans thought they were faking it. 




 Another great anime scene is the [Hong Kong scene from Ghost in The Shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB-ik-Bpl0c). In my opinion it is more beautiful and shows off the true hand crafted nature of anime.  




 Yep it is. [The character of Billy Batts getting done by Joe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzqZNRVIQpM) 




 I was at this game and there was lots of booing from the crowd and then it slowly subsided after 10 minutes as everyone probably realised it was more serious. I was surprised at how long it took for them take him away on the stretcher, guessing they had to fully assess the extent of the damage? 




 Before anyone else says them.

These are Directors cutstheatrical
Kingdom of Heaven Directors cut

Blade Runner Final Cut (I don't think it's even possible to get a hold of the theatrical release any more?)

Aliens Directors Cut

Terminator 2 Directors Cut




 




 Loving flood on the floor, great track in my opinion.  




 I think it's quite easy to hate the headlight design but for me because it's quite different to all the super edgy designs we have now, I do indeed find it quite refreshing and can see it growing on me quickly. 




 I'm really digging the new Purity Ring album! 




 Yeah I don't see why they couldn't. They are talented and most likely be scooped up quite quickly if they aren't already independent.  




 There probably will be another Alien Isolation just under a different publisher, I'm guessing that once the licence expires Sega won't renew it and someone else will step in. It's too big of a licence for it to just be stagnant, especially with a new film on the horizon.  




 He actually became a bit of a bro towards the end of Dawn of the Dead, douche at the beginning, bro at the end.  




 So I just finished Alien Isolation for the first time and one thing that stood out was the Japanese translation on signs in Sevastpol station, now I know that a lot of sci-fi works use Japanese lettering, but why is this the case? Don't get me wrong it looks really cool, I remember seeing it in Alien on the self-destruct box as well, just curious is all.  




 Bear in mind that James Cameron back when he was filming Aliens didn't nearly have the same pull as he does now. Now that he has two of the highest grossing box office films Fox are just letting him take his sweet ass time with the Avatar sequels.  




 Same here, really loved Prisoners, I have yet to watch Enemy but I have heard good things. A proper Aliens sequel and Blade Runner sequel announced in the same year, what year is this?! 









 Gone Girl, you know which scene. 




 Alien Colonial Marines which was unfortunately a terrible game. 




 Damn I thought Jap cars were pretty good here in Australia but NZ sounds a lot more relaxed with the laws.  




 Also is it implied that it's Sebastian who was helping Nikola during Galahad's recovery? Maybe he faked his death?(even though it seems pretty difficult). 




 I don't understand what really differentiates this from a top of the line S65 AMG long wheel base? 




 Personally I am rooting for the P1. Ever since I played Need for Speed II all those years back, the Mclaren F1 has and still is my favourite super car ever made and the P1 reminded me of the F1 just in it's sheer ridiculousness. My other pick would be the 918 since that car is pushing the hybrid technology forward the most out of the 3 also I feel that it looks a ton better than the La Ferrari. 

La Ferrari is the last one for me since I always feel that Ferrari are always up themselves in terms of how they present their brand. Don't get me wrong they make great cars however how the way they present themselves to motor journalists and car enthusiasts, just turns me off them. I know I didn't really analyse from a technical POV which would come first, this is just who I want to come first.  




 Are you suggesting that Ferrari actively track where each car is at any given time? 




 Ah right TIL
