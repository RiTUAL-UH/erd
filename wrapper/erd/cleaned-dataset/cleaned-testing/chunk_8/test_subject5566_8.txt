 Food Finder is a bit different to Foursquare in that I want to make it ridiculously easy to find amazing food. Which is why City Mapper, Google Street view and soon Uber have been integrated directly into the app.

Also, you may notice that there are no ratings and only one short review on Food Finder. This is because Food Finder is highly curated and only contains amazing restaurants. 
























 How did you find this?
