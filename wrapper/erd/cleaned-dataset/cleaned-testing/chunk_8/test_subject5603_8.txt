 To achieve the American dream all you need is hard work and a billionaire friend to provide financial assistance.  




 Mr. Braman and aides to Mr. Rubio have declined to say how much personal financial assistance he has provided to Mr. Rubio and his wife, directly or indirectly, but it appears to total in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Does anybody else think this might cast a shadow on Marco Rubio's up from the working class story?   









 Mansplain your conservative political views to me. 




 I was hoping Obama was going to seize it and give in back to Mexico.  'Sorry, turns out we didn't need this. More trouble than it's worth. Except for Willie Nelson. We'll be keeping him.' 




 Fortunately there's no charge to not sit next to a member of Congress while not attending a Taylor Swift concert. 




 In all fairness to Walker, giving corporations cash was the important part of the equation.  




 Good article, but the huge amounts of outside and dark money being spent on the 2016 campaign are a wild card. No one really knows how much that's going to influence the results in contested states. 




 He just wanted to show that anyone can succeed in America!!  It just takes hard work!! And some insider information and the willingness to skirt the law!1 




 Good news.  But since we have about 3 decades of wage stagnation to recover from, don't get overly excited. 




 The GOP loves local control!  Except when local governments do something that they don't like. 




 Cardiologists actually make [rather more than 250K](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/07/20/the-best-and-worst-paying-jobs-for-doctors-2/2/), and I imagine the cardiologists in NYC make more than the average. 




 You can start with [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpKB6OZ_B4c). 




 Scott Walker - Ending Wisconsin's Tradition of Fine Public Education !!

I'm offering him this slogan for his own use, free of charge. 




 All the King's Men by Robert Penn Warren. No book, fiction or non, tells a better story about how American politics work.  Empire of Liberty by Gordon S. Wood, about the first years of the Republic, is the best for early American politics.  Turns out much of today's political conflict goes back to the nation's start. 




 It would help if we started making clearer the ties between campaign financing and the actions of politicians.  Somehow it's considered impolite in mainstream media to point that, to pick a particularly execrable politician , James Inhofe the Senate's leading climate change deniers, and how much of his [campaign funding](http://maplight.org/us-congress/legislator/576-jim-inhofe) he receives from oil and gas and electric industries.  




 Repeat until understood. 




 'Politically driven science' being 'science we disagree with'. 




 Well, most of them are pretty smart. 




 Wisconsin is one of the states where the middle class is disappearing the [fastest](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2015/3/19/the-shrinking-middle-class-mapped-state-by-state), and these nitwits are spending their time micromanaging food stamps benefits. Way to address the important issues guys.   




  Ryan said he has strong concerns that reining in campaign spending could have a "chilling effect" on free speech. **If donors had to disclose their identities when they gave to charitable groups or some nonprofits, he fears that individuals could be retaliated against for expressing themselves politically.** "I see an attempt to infringe on First Amendment rights, to give some people more tools to harass citizens from participating in democracy and expressing themselves, and I don't think that is a good thing," Ryan said during a Christian Science Monitor breakfast Thursday morning.

Ryan is telling us the first amendment is supposed to protect you from being harassed if you express your opinion?  Novel interpretation.   




 If we invest in green energy and makes a few tweaks to how we consume energy and dispose of waste, energy can be far cheaper, cleaner and more abundant in the future.

That's the argument we should be making for getting off the carbon.  Continuing to rely heavily on fossil fuels is holding us back from cheaper energy.   




 William James thought there were [3 steps](http://quoteseverlasting.com/quotations/2013/06/19/6792/a-new-idea-is-first-condemned-as-ridiculous-and-then-dismissed-as-trivial-until-finally-it-becomes-what-everybody-knows-william-james/) each new idea goes through. I'd say Charles Koch is trying out stage two. 




 I say Walsh is speaking gibberish, but I don't think it reaches that level. 




 Rand Paul blamed Eric Garner's death on [cigarette taxes](http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/03/politics/rand-paul-eric-garner-taxes/).  You might want to start considering, just a wee little, how the police behavior figures in these problems. 




 When politicians depend on the support of a handful of wealthy individuals and corporations, whose interests do you think they're going to put first?  Yours?  The nations? Or their benefactors? 




  After reading a little more of Chaits work, I see him as some kind of New York Times wannabe. He is one of those cliched, tiresome liberals who is always trying too hard. You know the type.

You mean statements like this? 




 Is this a serious remark or an attempt at humor? 




 Once upon a time, it was thought ridiculous and absurd to think women should be treated equal to men. The 21st century is ready when you are Marco!
 




 Apparently, having an opinion different from Ted Cruz makes you either a communist or a fascist.  The man is an overwrought weenie. 




 The preferable solution, but if it's not politically possible to implement a tax, a subsidy for low carbon forms of energy could serve as a backdoor way of charging for the external costs of carbon. 




 Different music for different moods.  I generally prefer listening to more complex music, but sometimes I want to hear something uncluttered and direct, like a Howling Wolf blues or Hank Williams ballad.  




 Even if the costs alternatives (like coal) don't include their indirect costs?  




 Indeed.  Here is an [fine performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNegch1_dyU) of a devastating piece by a composer who is none of the above.  




 If you like Kind of Blue and mellower music,  I would say [Relaxing] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vNreXKw2Qw) or [Cooking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcIiu1kQMx0) with the Miles Davis Quartet ought to  be your next listen.  




 Judging from my own experience, I'd say classical music (in the widest sense of the word) would gain a bigger audience if the performers and promoters started presenting more 20/21st century pieces.  For listeners coming from a jazz or rock background, I think Stravinsky, Glass, Shostakovich, Whitacre or (insert your favorite modern or  contemporary composer here) are much more readily accessible than music from the Classical and Romantic Eras.

Edit: missing words 




 Something Happened isn't as great, but it's a fine satirical novel.  And God Knows is great for the first 70 pages or so, as good as Catch-22.  




 Not like the 60's when we had challenging lyrics like 'Yummy, yummy, yummy, I got love in my tummy.' Ah bubblegum music. 




 It as if the GOP doesn't want Wisconsin citizens knowing how much money and time their governor is spending 'promoting the state's economy'. 




 Extracting tax subsidies and paying it's cashiers [less than $9 an hour](http://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Kohl-s-Hourly-Pay-E592.htm).  Kohl's is the perfect company for Walker's economic vision. 









 I've had [this album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_of_Bud_Powell_on_Verve) for about 20 years and I've never grown tired of it. [This one](http://www.amazon.com/Steal-Away-Spirituals-Hymns-Songs/dp/B0000046YU) isn't bad either. And why hasn't anybody mentioned [Earl Hines] (http://www.amazon.com/Jazz-Royalty-Hines-Plays-Ellington/dp/B00000J39U). 




 The QCEW data show Minnesota slowing down from March 2013 to March 2014. But the CES data do not. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle  and thats why we collect data on employment from multiple perspectives. ... private sector job growth in Minnesota was faster after the Great Recession than Wisconsins. 

[No, Minnesota is not 'dead last' in the Midwest in job growth](http://www.minnpost.com/macro-micro-minnesota/2014/10/no-minnesota-not-dead-last-midwest-job-growth) 




 As he tours the country, Walker has boasted that new businesses are starting up in Wisconsin at a higher rate than the rest of the country and that income growth for residents exceeds the national average.

Although he might prefer you don't ask him how the [income growth](http://www.wisconsinbudgetproject.org/pulling-apart-2014)  is being distributed.   




 I hope their candidate includes this in his advertising.  Something like 
Scott Walker - the Best Boy for the Billionaires! 




 I'm still waiting for a right to work advocate to explain how lower wages will lead to prosperity. 




 Taxes are the wrong problem.  More income for the poor and middle class would generate more jobs than tax cuts. 




 Problem accurately and succinctly stated. Please repeat until understood. 




 I'm sure learning that Scott Walker busted Wisconsin's teachers union will strike fear in heart of America's enemies. 




 The real question isn't why Wisconsin is lagging in wage and job growth. The real question is who Scott Walker will blame this month. 




 GOP lawmakers want the poor to pay for tax cuts for the rich

FTFY
 




 Push the income to the top, push the taxes to the bottom.  That's all you need to know about 21st GOP economic goals. 




 Ted Cruz is [owned](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/416643/meet-ted-cruzs-billionaire-donors-eliana-johnson) by conservative billionaires. 




 Something I wouldn't have expected from Pat Metheny.  I much prefer this collaboration to Ornette Coleman's other work around the same time. 









 True. Accurate science, like evolution or climatology, is not acceptable. 




 About time someone said this about the GOP economy this clearly and unambiguously.   









 Since Kohl's received a huge tax subsidies and pays low wages, I'd say it's the perfect model for the economy Walker wants to create. 




 Thats how I think about your money, the taxpayers money. The government could charge you a higher rate and a few of you could afford it, or we could lower the rates, broaden the base and have more people participate in the economy.

Yes, because so many of us have the option of not participating in the economy if we think the tax rate is too high.   




 The [most authoritative study](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-04-17/kansas-governor-brownbacks-lab-for-steep-tax-and-budget-cuts) of the effect of these measures is a January report by the Kansas Legislative Research Department, a nonpartisan arm of the legislature. It found that revenue isnt keeping up with expenses even after cuts in spending on K-12 schools, colleges, libraries, local health departments, courts, and welfare. If nothing changed, the research departments numbers show, the states general fund would have a shortfall of about $900 million by fiscal year 2019, or 14 percent of expenses that year. The states constitution requires a balanced budget, so either taxes will have to go back up or spending will have to come down even more. **The tax cuts dont pay for themselves,** says Duane Goossen, who served as state budget director under both Republican and Democratic governors. **That just is not happening.**

But I doubt any number will rattle the true believers.  Tax cuts are always good, and any contrary evidence is denigrated or ignored. 




 Ted Cruz - America needs a tough talking weenie for President! 




 I'm hoping God tells him to go for it.  And tells him to smite Walker, Bush, Rubio, Paul, and Cruz with a sword. 




 Something else that's always changing is the methods for and the costs of generating energy from non-fossil fuels.  Sticking with carbon is a loser's choice. 




 Like Sara Palin, Walker plays the politics of resentment quite well. Wisconsin's biggest economic problems center around the still shrinking manufacturing economy, but Walker's managed to convince part of the electorate that Wisconsin's problems are the over-educated liberals, overpaid civil servants and welfare recipients.  Meanwhile he's greatly reduced public services, ended many employment protections, and has ground down Wisconsin's education system, which was one the finest in the country.  He wants to makeover Wisconsin into the low wage model, typically found in the reddest states. I see the strategy he's using, but why people keep falling for it, I wish I understood.  




 Try Go Down Moses. 




 [At $8.57 an hour for a cashier](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Kohl-s-Salaries-E592.htm), the Kohl's model would align perfectly with Walker's economic goals.  This man isn't worth his own turds.  




 Governors in Wisconsin are elected for for year terms. 2012 was a recall election, and was not held at the same time as the Presidential election. 




 Whereas Paul needs a toy bucket to hold his accomplishments. 




 Wisconsin has two electorates, one that only shows up in Presidential election years and one that shows up for every election. In Presidential election years, Wisconsin elects senators like Tammy Baldwin and Russ Feingold, and almost always votes for the Democratic Presidential candidate (albeit sometimes by very thin margins).  In off year elections, when the voting population skews older, Wisconsin elects conservatives like Walker and Ron Johnson.  









 And we all thought he was an arrogant politician, growing up cossetted and wealthy environment.  But look he drives his own car! And he eats fast food! So he must care about common Americans.  He's truly one of us! 




 Hope you're right.  No time to get complacent though. 




 It's likely to only get worse. Budget cuts to the IRS will make it [even easier](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/12/rich-people-cheer-republicans-cut-irs-budget) for the wealthy to evade taxes and lowers the risk of an audit.  The Dems should make it a campaign issue.   




 Finally, a ray of light here in Wisconsin. 









 Passing pointless , grandstanding laws that smack down the unsuccessful and unfortunate.  Your GOP in action!!! 




 Claims to help the poor, actually hurts them. Pretty much the regular GOP playbook. 




 And these guys are supposed to appeal to millennials?  




 You're correct, a business exists to earn money. The job-creating claim is used to justify special tax breaks for and reduce restrictions on businesses. 




 I obviously can't speak to your family's tax situation, but I really don't see any reason to doubt the numbers in [this chart](http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2015/04/who_pays_taxes_in_america_in_2015.php#.VS7kpfnF9AY). 




 Sure it's an important part of the economy.  But right now we capital sitting idle (people are buying government bonds at zero interest) because there aren't enough investment opportunities.  The economy is short of demand now, not capital.  




 It's not people who are working 80 hours a week building a business that are pulling a trick, and it's not even the 1% that pulling a trick. It's the investor class .1% (or even the .01%) that are running off with a huge share of America's income.   




 If you're wealthy, you're not going to be taxed when you're dead.  Your heirs are going to be taxed, who didn't do anything but win the birth lottery.  Part of the reason for estate taxes is that great concentrations of wealth tend to destabilize countries, especially democracies. (You need to have 5 million before the estate tax is an issue.)  




 Again the consumer demand would make it worthwhile to start a bakery. But the point of the analogy is that an economy requires both sellers and buyers, supply and demand, and the GOP has given way to much credit and advantage to the suppliers, to the point where it's starting to suppress demand.  




 This comment from Temuzjin summed it up pretty well

To create jobs, you generally need supply of goods and demand for goods.
A rich entrepreneur who hires people to make goods helps with the supply side. These are commonly called "job creators."
However, you could just as easily call a guy who buys a loaf of bread (or another good) a "job creator" because he or she helps with the demand side. Without demand, jobs that supply goods soon become unprofitable, which means that those jobs vanish. 




  The "rich" are not a fixed set of people.

The GOP is trying to [fix that] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-push-for-a-permanent-aristocracy/2015/04/14/aa434f82-e2e5-11e4-81ea-0649268f729e_story.html). 




 Refresh my memory, who was pushing for the war, Bush and the Republican legislators or the Democrats? 




 The point is that you need multiple ingredients to create jobs, especially consumers.  To say that the wealthy are the job creators is like saying that gasoline is what makes cars move, and ignoring everything else. I also noticed you didn't include anyone from the investment and banking industries, which is group that has benefited the most over the last decades. 




 They wouldn't have created many jobs without a middle class to spend money on their products. And I notice you didn't include any one who inherited their wealth on your list. 




 It's the same game of hide the ball the GOP has playing since the 1980's.  Look at this tax cut!  Think how much working families will save! No need to look at the numbers too closely.  It's a tax cut for everybody! 




 Telling us they're the 'job creators' was another pretty good one. People have been falling for that one for decades.

Edit: I don't think I've ever posted anything on Reddit that recieved this many responses, 
(some of them quite good). So, while I have your attention, please let me elaborate a little:

Take your investment capital and try to run a successful job-creating business in a place that lacks.

- a government that enforces contracts

- a government that protects you against physical assault and fraud.

- Government services (Take your brilliant idea for a business and open it a place with crappy roads
and no public transportation.  Or for a real challenge, a place with no public water and sewer.)

- competent employees (who in America, have usually been educated at public expense)

- or most importantly, customers with money to spend

Sure investment capital plays a role in creating jobs and wealth.  But it's not the whole game.  The conservatives have exaggerated the role capital plays in the economy, and used it as a reason to justify low taxes or public giveaways to business, to reduce the rights and protections of employees, and policies that reduce labor's share 
of the [national income](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/why-labors-share-of-income-is-falling/l).  




 To be fair, they also did a pretty good job of weakening America when George W. Bush was president. 




 Today's Republican Party! Making America's economy work very well for a very few! 




 Dumb as a 50 lb. bag of potatoes, those Idaho lawmakers. 




 Apparently we need to be either subtle or sarcastic, not both. 




 I hope he doesn't spend too much time working on his inauguration speech.  [Current odds](http://www.oddsshark.com/entertainment/us-presidential-odds-2016-futures) are not running in his favor. 




 While other GOP contenders have called for loosening penalties for nonviolent drug offenders, Rubio has not ... He has also said that marijuana "is not good for the country," and that he thinks there's "no responsible way to recreationally use" it.

Unlike, say, alcohol. 




 Guess I should have added an /s.   




 Once again, needless government regulations are obstructing a business.  Think the GOP will pick up on this?

Edit:  Holy Molyl, this is certainly an impressive number of downvotes.  I didn't think this was needed, but **/S**. 




 Can't see why. The changes he wanted to make was about the only time he's been honest with Wisconsin.  




 Wong Michelle. God is punishing us with a plague of Republicans. 




 Ken Burn's Jazz Series is a decent enough introduction.  




 I don't think the super PACs funding our elections are run by people who spend a lot of time on buses. Or care much about the people taking them. 




 Well, they'd feel pretty foolish if they paid retail for a candiate like Ted Cruz. 




 We cannot quite say Paul committed a Four-Pinocchio violation, but its close.

But the kid's got a lot of talent.  Bet he does it next time. 




 If we ignore climate change, maybe it'll go away.  Or maybe we'll go away. 




 Somehow, the GOP only gets hysterical and overwrought about the deficit when the issue is social service spending. Tax cuts for the wealthy or defense spending?  No worries!     









 So thats why ALEC and Scott Segal are signaling to other conservatives to shut the heck up about climate science  not because any flood of solutions is forthcoming, but because the science fight has become a distraction from the real work, the important work, which is blocking solutions and protecting the interests of the wealthy.

Get ready for a new exciting set of lies about climate change! From the people who've been lying about climate change for last 30 years! 




 It's as if they've discovered an antidote for facts. 




 Haskins called it a rather extreme position to say that we ought to allow dangerous pollutants to destroy the only planet we know of that can completely sustain human life, and he suggested work on technologies that can reduce CO2 emissions without destroying whole economies.

Tell me, after your organizations spent a couple decades trying to deny an obvious truth, why would I take any argument offered by ALEC or the Heartland Institute seriously in the future? 




 I don't understand why.  They never seem to have a problem ignoring the interests of middle and lower income Americans. 




 He certainly shows the same ability to understand [environmental issues](http://thesciencewritingblog.com/2014/09/07/ronald-reagan-said-trees-cause-more-pollution-than-automobiles-do-ignoring-trees-conversion-of-co2/).

Edit: missing word 




 "'Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.

Arrogant,overfed and unconcerned -  Looks like the GOP has hit the trifecta.  




 Far right I can understand. One can make cogent arguments for conservative positions.  It's this sort of nonsensical legislation that makes me wonder if their brains have lost partial function.
