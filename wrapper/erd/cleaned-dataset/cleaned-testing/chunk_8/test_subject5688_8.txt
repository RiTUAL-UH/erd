 Trent with Oliver Stone AND RODNEY DANGERFIELD. 




 I get it.
 




 Time for a jog. 




 Nothing but [prams](http://imgur.com/a/oL8Eg#0).
 




 *Varieties*. Unless I'm missing something. Very cool otherwise!
 




 I like to think of this as the Happy Gilmore slapshot of the cycling world. 









 I agree. Dogs don't like to put themselves where they're likely to be reprimanded by the owner. They're taught to play nice otherwise they'll get a paddlin' and I don't think you can teach cats the same sentiment. The real 'dick' in these videos are the owners, causing the conflict with, and then laughing at their dogs trying to cope with mixed messages. 




 I'm guessing it will be to promote the VEVO Tension video. 




  "what the fuck do I say to this guy?"

I felt the same way when I met him. All I could muster up was to continue a joke conversation that Aaron North started when he was signing a record of mine. Trent didn't hear my stupid joke, but was nice enough to get me to repeat it so he could hear. I managed to get a smirk from him, so at least I've got that going for me.
 




 The ol' 'help me insult you more effectively' PM. I like the cut of your jib.
 














 And having varying levels of success.
 














 Is this the complete photo? As awesome as it is, It would be great to have his whole shadow in frame.
 




 Wartime hipsters.
 




 Fair call. It was only marginally better than 'The Circle of Life'.
 




 You're right. It is the worst type of post because it turned into a circlejerk of sorts. It was initially in defense of AskMyFavouriteColor's comment. Walk down the street and ask the first ten strangers you meet what a Cerberus is and you'll get a blank stare from at least 9. I can guarantee that the majority of people on this thread that recognise a Cerberus, recognise it from Harry Potter - one of the most widely read pieces of fiction of the last two decades. A smaller percentage will have already of known it from ancient mythology.  So it shouldn't be accepted that everyone should know.  I started editing because of something I remember reading on Reddit recently. That was there are some things that you can't criticize on Reddit and Harry Potter is one of them. I was merely curious and wanted to put it to the test.  




 The maple kind?
 




 Buy the ticket, take the ride.
 




 Not everyone has read or watched the Harry Potter series.

Edit: I haven't read or watched the Harry Potter series.

Edit 2: I think the Harry Potter series is overated.

Edit 3: It's amazing people are still reading this down here. Also, I imagine that J.K. Rowling stole many ideas for          Harry Potter.



 




 Stygian Cerberus?

 









 Well now, that's uncomfortable. 




 He also spoke about the (early) influences of the book 'Midnight Express'. 




 The head of a smaller bird.
 




 One, two, he's after you...
 




 'sup. 




 [Uh, Hildi 'in the hot box.](http://i.imgur.com/2F0JHOz.jpg) 




 That's a very good call. 









 That's right, I remember now. Hell, he even made fun of his own fans in the same way. 




 I'm fairly sure I saw similar references in Jhonen Vasquez's 'Johnny the Homicidal Maniac'.  




 'sup Imgur. 




 I've never had so much fun. 




 Motherfucker. 









 Tell him he's dreamin'. 









 "Awww FU-" 




 WOAHDUDE.
 









 Nothing special to report, really. There is a main water pipe and sewerage system that runs the length of my street. Due to age, and because of the hill that my street runs over, these pipes have always been problematic and there is always maintenance going on. One day a few months back it was shit city. The sewerage pipe burst while they were trying to fix it and a brown river gushed down the hill for an hour. They 'fixed' it again up until yesterday when the street sharted, as per the photo. All good for now.

TL;DR - Problematic sewerage pipe. 




 If so, I really hope it's not menstruating.
 




 A gaping shit hole, no less.
 









 Move over Third World Kid, introducing Skeptical Fox.
 









 Haha...dont ask me why, but I thought that was Dave Navarro. Eddie did sport a mohawk at some stage though.

Edit: I didnt even notice the tattoos.

 Didn't you hear? Less is more.
 




 Dogs are a good example of interactive pets. Cats are, not so much.
