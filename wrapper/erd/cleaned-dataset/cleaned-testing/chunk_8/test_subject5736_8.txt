 Thank you! 









 I'm getting a tattoo soon of the solar system and am including a line in each planet to indicate the direction of their axial tilt. using this picture as reference http://rossmannellcomments.edublogs.org/files/2013/12/Planetary-Axial-Tilts-1qtzpi8.jpg can i make the angles negative? so instead of Earth being 23.4 degrees away from the sun, can it be 23.4 degrees pointing towards the sun? I'm assuming yes because that is what happens during summer, but just wanted to make sure. Thanks!
