 I don't consume nicotine, nor am I a big baseball fan, but I thought this was interesting.  Will they allow gum?  How many players chew tobacco?  Any notable players chew it? 









 As a basketball addict, law school graduate, media researcher, and writer, Silver could confidently rely on me as a dynamic, creative, collaborative, hard-driving member of the league office.  I would take great pride in researching international digital television rights for live broadcasts, forecasting changes in social media demographics, writing speeches for Silver's appearances with non-profit charities, brainstorming novel approaches to preserving the game's competitive integrity, and getting his dry cleaning if need be.  Whatever needs to be done thoroughly, correctly, and thoughtfully.

I would always remind myself that the NBA is no where without the fans, as the game obviously existed before the creation of the league. The game is as important to the high rollers who take private jets to away games on a whim and have lavish arena suites as it is to the single parent who saves up just enough each year to drive four hours both ways to take their children to a home game, sit in the nosebleeds, and savor every moment as their family cheers on their team.

Silver and previous commissioners have been from New York, Connecticut, or Massachusetts, but hopefully they'd let a hard-working Midwesterner join in the fun.  The NBA is truly unique entertainment, a growing (and complicated) business, an aspirational calling, and has a storied, memorable, highlight-filled past.  I want to be a part of its storied, memorable, highlight-filled future, all while contributing to the continued success of the league I've loved since I first picked up a basketball.

See...  Completely serious.  :) 




 Adam Silver should hire me.  Completely serious. 




 So basically this is a blank canvas to share what's been swimming around your head about matters relating to the NBA.  Sometimes we all have thoughts that may not be worth making a post, so just reply with what's been on you mind!  Have fun and let it out.  We are here to listen and comment and upvote. 









 Where do all our Venn diagrams overlap?

Edit:  a better word. 




 Please describe them if possible.  Thanks and Happy Siete De Mayo! 




 Looking forward to Scorsese directing you in "Spider-fella". 




 Feel free to explain your answer and respectfully egg on division rivals. 




 Edit:  Be sure not to downvote just because you disagree or dislike someone's answer.  Reply to create a robust discussion instead.  Have fun! 









 So you can be a Browns fan and say Johnny Manziel (QB), then others with reply to you with offers from their own team.  Perhaps there will be counter offers or 3-way trades that require representation from other franchises?

Who knows.


You can trade multiple players, draft picks, coaches, mascots, whatever.  Just will be interesting to see what we think assets are worth.


Keep in mind, if you're including players/assets that others might not know too much about, please provide information about them (position, years in league, stats, highlight reel)


Have fun!

Edit:  Fixing what needs to be fixed. 




 Obviously half-time would be a relieving endeavor.  But what if they need to drop a huge deuce in the middle of the 3rd quarter?  Do they send in a 6th man and go to the locker room?  Do they train their digestive system by eating at certain times?  Or are they all iron colons? 




 Outstanding current players who you have a strong feeling will just never quite make the cut.  Not looking for just borderline HoF players who you think could go either way.  I'm talking the ones you KNOW won't make it but get really, really close. 









 Be sure to mention the location of the stadium and franchise.  Looking forward to discussions about Wembley Stadium.  Seriously. 




 Humorous fat jokes are allowed, but looking more for stories, habits, feverish depression after a pre-season loss, etc.
