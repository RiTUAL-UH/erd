 Also, do you know of any way to test whether or not it is the brake lines, besides of course having taken the caliper off and have it successfully compress?  




 This would probably make the most sense out of anything anyone has told me all day. Thank you much. I've gotta look into where to buy brake lines. I've had real issues getting any sort of part for my car, because I don't know what's limited edition, and what's stock Mk4 GTI parts. This specific part of brake line costs $45 on ECS tuning, and while that's better than $232 for a caliper from them, I'm sure someone has it cheaper.  




 I'm not disagreeing with you, it would make sense and you're probably right, but Wikipedia is not a source. Thank you for your insight.  




 Interesting. Do you by chance have a source for that? 




 I had twisted the boot while turning the piston inward towards the caliper. I put the boot back into place, but if anything I'll buy a new boot, not a whole caliper.

Happy Cake Day 




 Ahhh! Sweet deal, man! Never heard of this website before, and although the website looks sketch, I guess it's covered by BBB.

When you ordered yours, were they brand new calipers? No chipped paint or wear/tear? Essentially, were they like the photo? 




 A little under a month ago, I bought new rear rotors and pads for my Mk4 20AE GTI, as the drivers side pads had been worn down to the metal. **While trying to compress the drivers side caliper, I could not get it in all the way**, and I tried literally everything - [it only went this far (2nd image is passenger side for comparison](http://imgur.com/a/7Ephj).

**I removed the caliper** from the brake lines and the e-brake cable - completely off of the car. **I spun the piston, and it went straight in** and shot fluid out of the hole where the brake line connects.

I put it back on the car over the new rotors and pads, and me and a buddy **bled the caliper** (I was operating the pedal, I don't know if he for sure did it right, but he does work with cars at a dealership).

My **brake warning light came on** - flashing and beeping, but no ABS light or check engine light - no code to read. It was a similar warning as to if I were to take off driving with the e-brake pulled, however the brake light was not solid on as it is when the e-brake level is pulled. 

Brakes were squishy on and off, but me and my buddy ended up pretty much bleeding out all of the squishyness and adding a bit of fluid (with where my reservoir is positioned, it's impossible to see the gauge   tell how much fluid to add, but it's not empty). Still had the same warning.

Decided to take it for a drive to see if it would get me to work tomorrow. I drove about 4 miles (brake warning light on intermittently), and as soon as I opened my door, I could smell it - the heat coming from the pads and the rotor on that side. I put my hand in front of the rim, and all of the surrounding air was hot as hell. **Its as if the pads are sticking to the rotor - like the brake caliper is pushing out onto the pads, but not retracting back into the caliper**. I have no idea what could possibly cause this. 

We decided to try getting a new caliper, [but none of the calipers in any store around me fit my 20th AE GTI](http://imgur.com/nTAXogC). ECS Tuning has the caliper for $232, and the VW Dealership has the caliper (only 3 of them in the US) for $200. I'm hoping to be able to just rebuild this caliper or find one that I can afford, because that price tag is just stupid high.

I'm completely lost and I miss my GTI. Been driving a Ford for the last 3 weeks :(. I have no clue what could cause this, so any advice is much appreciated.

If I can supply any more information or images to make the situation more clear, just let me know. I do have the caliper off of the vehicle and the piston removed - however I have no clue what I'm looking at.

**TL;DR in bold**

[Here's some images of the two sets of threads I could see inside of the caliper.](http://imgur.com/a/LoOli) 




 Also, I took the caliper apart to see if I could quickly see any obvious fuckery, however it looks pretty clean. The only dirt I could find was on the very outside of the actual piston itself.

Pay no attention to the last few images, another user was trying to help me find a part number on the caliper somewhere. 




 Thanks for the quick reply, man.

I know for sure that the handbrake lever in the car was down all the way, but I don't know for certain that something wasn't pulling the handbrake mechanism on the caliper, as I've made some adjustments in the way the cables connect to the lever (cables kept falling out of the bracket, couldn't get it tight, just duct tape wrapped them). I checked a couple times and it appeared to be in the correct spot, however I'm tempted to put the caliper back on and disconnect the e-brake line to see what that does, if anything.

I took the caliper apart and took some pictures of the two sets of threads I could see. They look pretty clean, not real screwed up from what I can see. I also went and tried to find any part numbers that were on the caliper - I didn't see anything apparent, however at the end of this album are all the engravings I could find.

That's good to know that the Audi TT has the same calipers. I will for sure look into that. 




 Thanks for the reply.

I'll check car-part.com, I hadn't heard of that before. So far Advance Auto, NAPA, and most other store websites haven't given me any luck.

It's weird that it still considered the fluid to be low in the reservoir, I definitely thought I had it filled enough. It'd be useful if anyone had an image of what "full" looks like in the reservoir, as I can't see  the side of my reservoir to look at the gauges. 

I did use the proper tool. I went and bought one of those cube tools and ground down two of the edges on the 4 prong side. I even attached that bitch to a powerdrill and sat at it for days, and while attached to the car it wouldn't go in that far.

I'm hoping to find out exactly what might be wrong with the caliper so that I could try to repair it.

 Just an update, as the GTI still isn't driving, and I'm about to make a new thread.

I removed the piston from the brake lines and the e-brake cable - completely off of the car. I spun the piston, and it went straight in and shot fluid out of the hole where the brake line connects.

 It's a real bummer, man. But think of it this way - you see now that she is shallow, and not compassionate. However, assume that she had the feelings she posted on her twitter, but instead she didn't express them. You two go on a date, she is there, but mentally still feels that. You become a couple, are together for a while, but still she has that disinterest, and at this point is wildly afraid to express it in fear of damaging you, so she cheats, and you find out, and it's 5x ad heartbreaking as that Twitter post. 

When a girl turns me down, it's a bummer, but it's a relief because I know that I don't have to be ultimately let down later on.

 This is inaccurate. 

Citation 135 points to the New York Times, which does talk briefly about the dementia they found by examining his brain tissue. However, they also talked quite a bit about depression, anxiety, paranoia, and self harm. This article does not say that the dementia was the reason he committed suicide, which is what you seem to be trying to find out. 

Citation 136 points to TMZ, which is the source that says that the dementia was a "critical factor, " however their source of that information is "someone connected to the Williams family." Not a doctor, not the person performing the autopsy, not a therapist, but this mystery person. 

 Sources connected with the Williams family tell TMZ ... Lewy Body Dementia was the "key factor" they believe drove him to kill himself. 




 That's good. The guy at the bottom of this thread hated it so much that he downvoted a large group of posts made by me.  




 You took the time out to dive into my profile? Yeah, I make posts on /r/depression. I've also saved lives there, too.

 These isticks were delivered from eleaf mid March. This was a thread in a group buy subreddit. They come straight from the vendor to us in the US. 

I was a member of this group buy, so maybe you can know what the fuck you're talking about next time before you claim I'm spreading false information.  




 Had to read this title 5 times before it made any bit of sense.  




 I may not know my physics correctly here, so take this with a grain of salt. 

I'd imagine that more loose/open/wide airflow would lead to less negative pressure. When my airflow is open, I do not get as great of flavor, nearly. For instance, I have an infinite clt v2 (don't ever buy one), and the flavor is not nearly as good as my fogger v4, however if I want better flavor from it, I close off the airflow, which in turn raises the heat of the air in the atomizer. 

With my fogger v4, it's hard to draw from - the airflow is tight, the atomizer chamber is small, and I get the greatest flavor I've tasted from it. I'd assume that being harder to draw, that there'd be more negative pressure in the atomizer? 

Maybe I'm completely wrong. Just wanted to see if I could assist.  




 Here is a thread in a subreddit full of people who all got their 50w isticks mid-march. Determines eleafs statement to be pretty false. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/SmogGB/comments/348myl/have_any_of_you_had_any_problems_with_your_isticks/ 




 I had similar feelings while waiting for the iStick 50w. If you want to see both Smog's and the communities response to the issue,[ check out my thread]( https://www.reddit.com/r/SmogGB/comments/2vp9f2/question_about_the_release_date_for_the_istick_50w/). It's reasonable to wait quite a bit of time.  




 I posted this because I believe their danger is getting way overhyped. Everyone on reddit was going absolutely crazy over the istick 50w before it came out. It was like THE best thing to hit the market and everyone **had** to get one. For a very long time, the istick series has been the top most recommended setup for beginners or for people to have as their next purchase/upgrade from an ego style battery. 

Now that everyone has one, people are having problems and it seems incredibly more widespread because... Everyone has one. My current hypothesis is that while it may "auto-fire" - that this won't happen if people simply turn the device off while they're not using it by clicking the fire button five times. This is the same thing everyone has had to do since someone had the grand idea of putting a flashlight battery in a metal tube - you have to lock the mech mod or it will fire in your insert area here. While mech mods have the ability to start fires and kill people if they are left unlocked, we still very widely accept them as a great product. However, the istick also has the capability of firing when left turned on (no one knows yet if this is just a specific batch eleaf put out), yet everyone is losing their fucking minds over the safety concerns of this product. Everyone is jumping on a bandwagon and telling everyone they know to throw the whole series of isticks in the garbage because they saw someone on reddit tell someone else to do the same. 

A theory that was talked about a month or so ago, is that because the button is directly under your tank, if your tank leaks Eliquid into the crevice of this button, the mechanism may stick. This is true with so many other devices out there. I take great care of my iStick, and I have yet to see a single problem, and I'm positive that as long as I keep it turned off (like my mech mod) when I'm not using it, and I keep the button clean, I'm still going to be able to love this awesome product. 




 Stop all the downloadin!  




 Discovered this item today. It looks very pretty, and I'm interested.  




 Thank you for advising. I'm trying to figure out if these auto fire while turned off.  




 I didn't mean to say locked, I meant moreso turned off. I press the power button 5 times to turn the vape off every time after I'm using it, as the habit just carried over from having a daily mech mod. The locking function only locks the arrow keys that adjust voltage/wattage. 

Did you mean locked, or powered off?  




 Try changing the wick.  




 Do you recall, was the 30w turned off? As in the button clicked 5 times?  




 No issues with mine. I think the whole issue is getting really exaggerated. All of ECR was fine with using a battery in a metal tube as long as you kept it locked. Now people are putting their 50ws in their backpacks without locking it and freaking out because they're firing without them pressing the button. I really hate /r/electronic_cigarette right now.  




 Every bot on reddit is an account except you.  




 Bot no run 




 Good luck. If it doesn't work, you can purchase a single evod battery from discountvapers.com for just a few bucks.  




 I've got a 50w, my buddy has had a 20w, passed it onto my roommate to pick up a 30w, and my bud across the country also has a 30w. We all love our devices and have had no problems.    
Edit: Lmao at the downvotes 




 Try screwing it into the charger and then turning it on.

If that doesn't work, leave it on the charger for a while and try again.

If that's not working, leave it screwed in but plug and unplug the charger, try to defibrillate the fucker. 

Make sure you click the button five times to turn the device on/off.  




 I started out rebuilding with kanger coils. It's excellent to start with. If you want to rebuild the whole coil, pull off the positive terminal pin on the bottom, as well as the insulator between it and the pin, and then just pull the coil and wick out. Then give all pieces a bath in some boiling distilled water, as this will clean the coil and rid of any wick left in the coil unit.
