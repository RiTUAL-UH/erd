He's prolific, clever, hilarious, and cranky.  He amuses me mightily.   




 Wait.... what just happened?  




 Sofia Ford Coppola.  I'd be expecting some great New Wave.  And some Radio Department.  




 [L'Eau D'Issey pour Homme](http://www.basenotes.net/ID26120927.html)... It's strange and wonderful.  Worst has to be Aqua di Gio.  Just no.  




 If you still have the booklet for the SNES game Super Mario World, it actually has an illustration that tells you.  I'm sure you can find it on google image search.  He's tall.  




 I was put on medication for hypertriglyceridemia at 21.  Because I wasn't overweight, the doctor told me it was genetic.  She also told me that because it was genetic, there was nothing I could do from a dietary standpoint to get off of my medication.

When I was 26, my body building friend told me about intermittent fasting and how you can use it to re-sensitize your body to breaking down various components and nutrients in your food.  I started doing a 20/4 schedule every day.  I quit taking my medication one month before my annual physical, and I'd gone from the 1000 level that got me on meds in the first place to a 200, which is high, but doesn't require medication!  The doctor let me go off of my meds!  




 Absolutely.  Then I'd loll all over my spacious, cool bed that no one has night sweats in...  




 "Take care!" 




 Neil Young!  




 So would you say it's safe to say, when it comes to marriage, you believe that people make their own beds and have to sleep (not have sex) in them? 




 This image just changed my life.  For the better?  It's not clear yet.  




 But Grumbler, what if your spouse hates to talk?  Avoids conversation like the plague?  




 I've recently discovered that my 8 month old daughter is obsessed with teeth.  She's stopped looking at faces and only looks at teeth.  If you get too close, she'll try to touch them.  Stranger still, she thinks they are funny.  She'll laugh if she touches them.  




 When holding your baby for the first time. 




 /u/late_night_grumbler - I've always wanted to see if Oscar the Grouch is as green as he looks in person. ;) 




 Don't worry, you have my word on all of this. :)

I'm very optimistic about you kids... You seem passionate, involved, and aware for your age.  I think you'll accomplish wonderful things.   




 What can millennials do to support you?  

This is probably pretty broad, but man, considering the garbage we have to put up with from the baby boomers regarding us and our life choices, I don't want to be that person...  




 We don't.  Both my mother and my husband are the type of people who will switch sides if you agree with them.  Ahahaha! (But it's not funny, it's annoying as fuck.) 




 I went out to lunch with a new co-worker.  He was obviously a very manipulative person.  He would make an assumption based on something innocuous I would mention, turn it into a piece of flattery, and then use it to ask an extremely verbose question that wasn't something I could actually answer, it was just to illustrate how smart he was....

This is vague.  Here:

Me: Oh, well I do intermittent fasting, so I didn't have breakfast.

Him: So, you seem to be very well aware that the US government is lying to us about how is in our food and what long term effects those lies have on us, and you're not having it.  That said, do you have any secrets or strategies you'd like to share regarding prenatal dieting to promote newborn growth and development?

Me: Um. No... I, uh, just didn't eat lunch meat.  (WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?)

Then we got in his car and he had a fuzz buster... And then he told me his favorite Led Zeppelin Album is IV.  I decided to never suggest we get lunch again.  




 Well, I will say that KIDS think you're one of them.  I had a funny incident with my best friend and her girlfriend where their 11 year olds kept trying to get me to flake off the adult group and do things with them.  Eventually my best friend had to explain that I'm a grown up and they needed to ignore me.  Ahahaha.  

The most ridiculous had to be when I was in Houston on a business trip.  I was 27, six months pregnant (like obviously pregnant, I weigh 107 lbs normally, so that baby was wayyyy out there).  I went to dinner with my CEO.  We sat down and the waiter handed him a normal folding menu.  They brought me a regulation sized football on a tee with the menu items printed on it.  This was a children's menu.  

The night I got married, I was 24.  I went out to dinner with my groom, his step sister and her husband.  The waitress was probably 17.  She looked up and said "So three adults and one child then?"

On my 16th birthday, I was turned away from seeing a PG-13 film.

When I lived in Ames, IA, I paid the child's bus fare of $.50 well into my mid-20's. 

I was once asked at a nightclub who I bribed to get my ID since it listed me as drinking age.
 




 Yeah, absolutely.  It's defensiveness at its finest.  The truth is that you're subjected to just as much, if not more, familial judgment once you HAVE the kid... You're not sleep training right or you aren't holding the baby right or you're not feeding them solids soon enough or god only knows what.  

Seriously, I'd just as soon not talk about my experiences as a parent.  I get not wanting to hear about it, and truthfully, it's not all that I'm thinking about... what a special snowflake my baby is and how to best strategize her whole life... I have a career and a marriage.  I'm a home owner, I volunteer for six hours a weekend as a companion for Hospice.  I have hobbies and interests that are independent of that little person I'm responsible for.  Having a baby doesn't lobotomize you and making your children the literal center of your universe only ensures they will be ill-prepared for their lives later on.  

Much like feminists and tumblr, a few nutjobs on Facebook have made us out to be completely crazed terrorists.  




 Yeah seriously.... if you don't want kids, and you have as much resentment for them as it seems, you probably shouldn't be a parent any way.... My Grandmother in law was always telling her daughters to their faces she never wanted them and they just held her back.  That's an awful thing to do to someone.  I don't want that for any child.  




 It really bothers me that child-free people attack children instead of the adults who are supposedly infringing on their freedom of choice.  Calling a little person a "shit-machine" is not cool.  You started out as a child too.  There's no need to be awful to little kids just because you don't want them.  




 You've got this wrong... if you see us next to actual children, we're obviously not children... it's when you lack proper context that people get confused.  Your character needs to be at an event with a bunch of adults.  I'm routinely offered a child's movie ticket and children's menus, but it's only when I'm out with taller adults... I'm nearly 30.  




 She's doing it wrong then.  I've had seven wedding proposals in my lifetime.  My actual husband never even proposed.  




 It's the true things that are the funniest... this is perfect fan-girl in 6th grade logic... I always imagined painting a wonderful portrait (of Tom Petty because I'm weird and have daddy issues) a la Marge Simpson... Fall wedding (he'd wear that light brown leather jacket with the tassels and I'd be in a tie-dye dress I'd never be caught dead in as an adult). 




 I'd have a ring of sunflowers around my left ankle.  Very 1990's.  My mom still bothers me about following through with this someday.  Uh, no.  




 I'm not surprised, but you can see right in my original post what the rationale is.... if you try to help someone, it shows there is a deeper investment there than a superficial, unnatural, and simple validation.  It shows you were listening and took the time to think about the how and why and what can be done.  A smart person doesn't surround themselves with "yes people," they find those who know what works and cut out what doesn't.    




 That's because most women want you to agree with them and tell them they're not crazy...  




 Really, why is that? 




 I have been a [manic pixie dream girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Pixie_Dream_Girl) for well over half of my serious relationships. 




 Attempt to solve or advise me how to solve what is bothering me.  I don't like it when men commiserate, it sends off warning bells.  I prefer a pragmatic 12 step solution.  Even if I don't take your advice, it shows you care.  Agreeing with me just tells me you want me to like you.  




 The best damn thing.  




 Answering machines.  I remember I used to love fiddling with that little cassette tape... it was so cute! :) 




 I like to laugh, and you make me laugh.  I feel obligated to talk about the things I love. :) 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2oijc5/girls_of_reddit_when_the_guys_arent_around_what/cmnfnr3?context=3

I'm not sure what it really is, but it should probably be this gem from the /u/late_night_grumbler .... I still laugh every time.  




 United States of Whatever - Liam Lynch

 I actually don't know anything about the guy behind the Radio Dept.  Although I think he might be a bit druggy... It'll be fine, I'm guessing.  




 I think it was intentional... Pard.  




 I think you'll find that these kinds of things are easy to pick up on right when you meet someone.  Typically it doesn't get as far as dating.  They've been written off before romantic involvement.  




 I would install a sump pump in my basement and remodel my bathroom.  




 Emphasis on that flossing bit... if you floss daily, you will add 5-10 years onto your lifespan.  It's very important, folks.  And if you don't suffer from Halitosis but do have bad breath, this is how you cure it!   




 J.K. Rowling addressed this.  She said it isn't taught in school, unfortunately.  She said that Wizards and Witches are pretty modest and self-conscious about the subject.  There was also a bit about group masturbation among Hufflepuffs, but that might've been a joke.  Sounds about right, however...   




 No, no, sorry.  The e-mail and phone systems are totally separate.  Here: Re-write: "One of the entry-level minimum-wage employees replied to all..." 




 Oh, sorry, the point was supposed to be that an entry level employee replied to all... I suppose the point is lost if you don't know I was working in Client Services for a huge Outsourcing firm.  




 Light (i.e. light roast, and light-hearted), sweet, and early. 




 A company-wide e-mail went out about our CEO stepping down.  One of the agents on the telephone replied to all on it saying she needed to have an IUD put in before she ended up pregnant again.   




 It's awkward to lift something and position it securely over the console from the driver's seat.  It's safer to situate the item properly by coming at it unobstructed and in a way that will make you certain it will stay in place.  Also, being that I'm 4'11.5", the wheel of my car and the seat are close enough together, not much fits... I don't have room to maneuver my bent elbow around.  I'd rather open the other door than reposition my seat.    




 I'm going to reply again, I got interrupted the first time. :)

If you're a lady, you might want to at least take a few cheesecake photos at home if you don't want to do actual bedroom shots.  Your body is never going to look the same, and you'll be glad you captured yourself in all your glory.  Keep them locked up, of course and out of the iCloud ;)

For saving up for your (or the mother of your children's) maternity leave, all the books will tell you to save salary for what you'll be out... that's great except most of us don't get paid in current week.  You'll want to save time out plus three weeks since that's how long it'll take before your first paycheck rolls in.

To expand upon the travel thing, if you like to go fishing and camping, please make sure to do that, it's going to be a few years before you're able to do that as a few day affair (you can have the in-laws watch the baby and boat for a few hours, but c'mon... it's not the same and you'll probably just miss the baby).

You should also just make a lot of time to be romantic with your partner.  Work on strengthening your relationship to the best of your ability.  The next few years will be a challenge and that part of your life is going to get pushed to the side quite a bit.  Talk to each other and spend time with each other and just appreciate each other.  :) 




 Well, I tend to find that /r/advice is a better place to go for sincerity, but you definitely won't get the same volume of replies.  If you must ask a question on /r/askreddit it is better to tag it as [serious].  Glad I could help!  




 Any spendy home renovations or projects... like if you know you need a new roof in the next 1-2 years, now is the time...money is going to be tight while you adjust.

Travel!

 Wow guys... wow.

I would ask them when they think they'll come to a decision and when you will be contacted.  I would ask them (if it wasn't already addressed in the interview) if you will be able to give the full amount of notice needed with your current employer if you are offered this position (you're pointing out how responsible you are).  I would ask them how long they have both been with the company, and emphasize that you're looking for a long-term career in a great company.  




 You're up awfully early... and arguing about LoTR? You must've had a restful weekend. ;) 




 You gave some very solid relationship advice to a kid today about perception and personal responsibility and refusing to be a victim. My wish for you is that you can give that gift to yourself. We live in this strange, beautiful world only once. I would hate for you to miss it by isolating yourself and cutting your life short.  




 Like the old Dr. Pepper slogan "You try it, you get it!" :) 




 Cream cheese and green olives! :) 




 That would make me very sad.  You need to live to find true love, do more traveling, and continue to offer outstanding upholstery.  Don't give up, VanDriver1... you're a cool dude.  




 You shall.  I think you might be clenching your teeth, working out just a little too hard, and pinching the occasional nerve. ;) 




 I want to stress that I'm not a medical professional.  It sounds to me like you have a few things going on.  I encourage you to bring these things up at your next physical.  They sound minor and relatively normal to me, but it's better to get peace of mind from a doctor than from a stranger on the internet.  :)  




 Well, that's kind of ironic of you to say... This link: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/heartattack/signs
was included in two of my replies in this same thread.  You'll notice they're from the same site.  I'll edit for you and add it to the main comment.  




 [I got this for you, friend.](http://www.md-health.com/Tingling-In-Left-Arm.html)  




 I actually didn't mean the multi-player... I meant just by myself. :)  

I only screwed around with the multi-player to do ridiculous things like to summon and become the Lich or the owner of the brothel and get rainbow armor and other stupid things that only amuse you for an hour.  




 The original Neverwinter Nights.  Man, I love that game.  Never gets old to me.  




 I'm not a doctor, however the sensation for a heart attack is commonly described as being only one arm and feeling like ice water is being poured down it.

It sounds to me like you're on the right track with your carpal tunnel theory.  I have it too.  If I use my hands too much during the day, at night I can't hold them over my shoulders without them trembling.  

I wouldn't worry about your heart just yet, but if you're really concerned, mention it at your next physical.

Take care! :) 




 I'm sorry to hear that your wife had heart issues.  I hope she's doing better now. 




 Well, just in case you want to read more about it, here is a great publication from the US Dept. of Health and Human Services.  It does say right in here that they don't believe the differences to be stark enough to alter the way we educate people about symptoms, however, it definitely talks about a proven delineation. 

http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/dec2007/nhlbi-10.htm 




 That's a great question.  [This article](http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/dec2007/nhlbi-10.htm) from the US Dept. of Health and Human Services correlates it to the fact that women live longer than men and the older you are, the less likely pain in your chest would be an obvious symptom.  




 TEAM YOUSE

 There is this stupid poster I made posted on every surface at my former job.  I made it in MS Paint.  Everyone thinks my husband made it. 

I also wrote their 100+ page orientation manual for incoming supervisors, but I went with a version code rather than listing myself as the author.  Same goes for the calling software user manual.  




 I walk on my tip-toes when I'm not wearing shoes.  My daughter is 8 months old... she's just started pulling herself into a standing position, but never stays flat on her feet. Awww.  




 Okage.  Shadow King Stan is hilarious!  In fact, the whole game is hilarious!   




 This isn't something I feel I need to purposefully state to head off advances... if I'm talking to someone as a fellow human being, sooner or later I'm going to bring up my husband in an anecdote or some other natural mention, as he's a huge part of my life.  If someone wants to know if I'm available, all they need to do is be observant enough to see the ring on my left hand.   




 Willow Lake shampoo and Orbitz soft drinks.  




 This question is super broad, so instead I'm just going to tell you a ridiculous story.

My general practitioner doesn't do pre-natal, so I was referred to an OB/GYN for all of those appointments.  In my first trimester of pregnancy, I got Shingles.  Shingles is technically a type of non-sexually transmitted herpes related to a mutation in the Chicken Pox virus stored in your body.  Because it was unrelated to my pregnancy, my general prescribed Valtrex to cure it.  I was to take it for a week.

Every appointment my OB/GYN would ask me how my Valtrex was treating me.  And I'd have to explain again, that I had shingles... I took it for a week, it's not ongoing... The third time this happened, I said all this again, and she said "So no outbreaks in your genital area causing you concern?" 

My OB thought I had herpes and was too embarrassed to discuss it.  I lived in serious fear she was going to order a C-Section to avoid me infecting my baby's eyes with an STI I didn't actually have.  




 Well, Tim Allen served time for being a cocaine dealer in his pre-Home Improvement days.  Apparently people either don't know about this, or don't care.  




 Sadly no, but the later is the goal in mind.  I'd start looking for jobs again as soon as possible.  Good luck, sir!  




 By secretly drop, do you mean go incommunicado or do you mean selling your contract to an employer?  




 I'm only shocked that more people don't realize that Bill Gates had rich parents.  Yeah, he's much, much richer than his parents, but the asshole had a Porche at 16.  It really grinds my gears every time I have to read that sanctimonious graduation speech of his about how you're an idiot for thinking your parents aren't people.  We didn't all grow up like you did, taking our parents for granted and treating them like shit, man.  It's not universally appropriate.  




 This is more of a public service announcement: Men and women have different early symptoms during a heart attack.  The commonly known ones are men-specific (numbness and tingling in one arm).  The early sign for women is a constricted throat.  Please talk about this in real life, you could save a life.

 Listen man, again, I never said I was raped. I don't believe I was. This discussion is happening outside of my reality. I'm glad that people are having a meaningful discussion about gender roles and assault and personal responsibility, but you'll notice I replied to a "one night stand" thread, not a listen to my sexual assault sob story thread. I was a young college student with an Internet boyfriend. This was almost a decade ago and both me and my ex are now married to other people. The kid the story is about is in a serious relationship.  




 I was knitting for years before the baby.  I'm a pretty fierce technical knitter.  My baby has only two things I've knitted her... an egg plant and some sock-topped moccasins.  




 I *was*... I have a baby now.  All my interests are on hold for the next five years minimum.  I also used to do relief print making and read voraciously.  These days I just knit.  




 The Sims 2... the little movies for important life events were so precious.   




 Probably their hair.  




 I got really heated about some asshole telling a newbie on the Pullip forum that a type 3 body and an Obitsu were comparable in height.  Yes, I know this looks like it was written in another language, but damn, don't lie to people just getting into the hobby! 




 Right?  I don't feel that much younger, but one time he said to me that he saw Nirvana play live in 1991 at First Ave in Minneapolis.... in '91, I was uh... four.  I was four.  




 I CANNOT believe it took someone this long to make this comment.  I thought this was going to be the first thing someone said.  Listen man, I'm really into color theory.  




 "We'll kick your ass" is better than "We'll put a boot in your ass."  I think you missed my point entirely.  




 Shout-out to "Accidental Racist" too.... I mean, this is one of those songs that when you tell people about it, they think you're kidding.  




 No.  My husband is 11 years older than me.  While this mattered less in my 20's, in my teens, it would have been very inappropriate.  Furthermore, my husband was jawdroppingly handsome in high school.  If we had been the same age, he would have been wayyyyy out of my league.     




 "We'll put a boot in your ass, it's the American Way."

Thanks for making us all look like assholes, Toby.  Jesus.  




 Well, I was very drunk, so drunk logic was telling me to punish myself for being unfaithful to my boyfriend.  I definitely regretted it later...  This incident was the catalyst for me to go on an anti-depressant.  




 Is it really necessary to call me a rapist?  You've taken an idea and made it quite personal.  I never used the word rape.  If you read my comment carefully, you'd be able to deduce that I felt awful about the whole thing.  I didn't attempt to press charges or any thing like that.  I bought him new sheets.  I get why you're upset, but let's not level a rape accusation at me to prove a point.  




 Uhhh.  I mean, I can list some arbitrary things that were wrong with me 7 years ago, but I'm guessing you're referencing something specific to this anecdote... your comment just doesn't help me narrow down what exactly.   




 I went over to this new friend's house.  Things started out fine.  He made breakfast for dinner.  He suggested we play a drinking game.  He got aggressive with things like "Never have I ever worn purple sneakers," or "Never have I ever worn a yellow hoodie," these being things I was actually wearing.  We were drinking vodka.  I got blackout drunk.  He ordered a $80 box set on my Amazon account as a birthday present for himself (which lead me to overdraw my account being that I didn't know about it until that happened).  We had sex while I was blacked out.  I bled all over his sheets because I was on my period.  When I woke up I was really upset because I had a boyfriend.  I ended up banging my wrist against the sink in the bathroom until I had a bunch of bruises.  He got me into the shower and calmed me down.  We never had sex again.  Insult to injury: I overdrew my account buying him new sheets.  




 My husband is 39.  He refuses to associate outside of work with anyone who is not part of his immediate family.  He has no real friends.  




 lol, I love you, but you know full-well I'm married to a man.  I was never a lesbian.  He was just bitter af. 




 I got a queen sized Martha Stewart Coral Spray duvet for $14.99.  I lost it in a break-up, and I loved the damn thing... to get another, I'd have to pay about $100 on eBay.
