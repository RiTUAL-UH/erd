 If I had one wish, I would fuck Tia and Tamara at the same time and put nametags on their titties so I don't get their names wrong  









 In the crowd there's a group of 3-5 Asian men in what looks like military uniform. I've just never seen another country's soldier/sailor in uniform in the US. It's definitely not an American military uniform.  




 Anyone know who those a Asian men in uniform are? They were at the game yesterday too.  




 Alternately, are there other resources I should look at? I'm just tying to expand my knowledge of subjects, including cars.  




 Join us in /r/sfgiants!  




  gt;I am not reporting that the Giants have discussed Sanchez for Gee

I am speculating that it makes a lot of sense


I'm not reading too much into this rumor.  




 Aoki: "Bi yourself a steak dinner. Tri and stop me."  




 I could literally stand there and take 3 strikes and be more effective.  




 He goes to the bench. As much as I like the guy, I think we all overreacted during his hot streak. The reality is he's a solid 4th outfielder, but that's it.  




 I'd like to see McGehee's stats when he bats with a runner on first and less than two outs. It seems like he's an automatic DP.  




 It's one thing to be on a cold streak. It's another thing to be a one man rally killer.  




 Bumgarner vs Ross. I'm staying away from this one.  









 That isn't a girl???  




 I have a shiny new score book that I want to use today, but I also want to watch the Warriors game.  




 I knew Weaver had fallen off a little bit, but I didn't realize his numbers were that bad this season. I hope you all took the over on this one.  




 Having Marc Jackson announce a Warriors game is a cruel joke.  




 This crowd is really something.  




 I'm actually more stressed out that I won't be able to get into a bar to see it. Everything is going to be packed.  




 *Hello m'lady, hello m'honey, hello m'ragtime gal*  




 Was there alone last week to see Maxwell's walk off. 




 Does your overall record include the teams marked with asterisks?  




 I'm waiting for Ubaldo to tip his cap after leaving the game in the 8th. 




 They have to do the wave now because they're going to leave at the end of the inning.  




 Oh, come on! We get it. The guy is slumping.  




 RIP OP 




 People don't realize how good he is on defense. If not for Arenado, Panda would probably have at least one Gold Glove.  




 The Devil's threesome.  




 I love Barry because I'm a homer. Not a fan of A-Rod. It's still history though.  




 He's now 1 HR shy of tying Willie Mays for 4th all-time.


Edit: The game is nationally televised on ESPN. He should get a few more ABs.  




 RIP OP 




 I, for one, would love to see War Machine forced into the octagon with Bones.  




 [Check out this filthy curveball from Chris Heston]( http://i.imgur.com/vuUwDRJ.gif) 




 I use a wet sponge and then dry it off with a paper towel.  




 Me! I took MM in under 5 rounds!  




 I'm taking the **San Antonio Spurs -6** vs the Los Angeles Clippers. They're at home and they looked sharp in their last game, even though Durcan, Parker and Ginobli combined for 12 points.

 I don't know what Matt Duffy did in the off season, but I have as much confidence in him as I do anyone in the lineup.  




 Was this the team he accused of stealing signs last year? I can't remember how that played out.  




 A 6 pack of Coors.  




 It will be interesting to see how Andrew Susac fits into the Giants' future plans. He has big league talent already. He just happens to be stuck behind the best catcher in baseball.  




 McGehee has the lifetime numbers to earn our patience at least through April.  




 "You need to diversify your bonds." 




 Weird. Panik got the day off on Wednesday. He came in late in the game, but I wouldn't expect him to need a day off today.  




 I hate it when people compare Bartolo Colon to Babe Ruth. I mean, he's good and all, but he's no Bartolo Colon.  




 After tonight, we only have 8 more games at Coors this season!  




 This is what happens when you live in a city whose claim to fame is a fictional boxer and a two ingredient sandwich.  




 Rumor is they'll eat $65mil of $80mil.  




 How do I score that at home?  




 **St. Louis Cardinals -1.5** vs the Milwaukee Brewers. Adam Wainwright is pitching against an absolutely atrocious Brewers team.  




 Definitely! He got that contract to win a ring and I doubt we would have won in 2012 without him.  




 Love to see him stay in the division. Would love even more if he totally shits on the Angels this year.  




 I've gone to many games alone. No one thinks twice about it.  




 This happened a couple weeks ago at a Sacramento Rivercats game in the 19th inning...but I left after 14.  




 I was sitting by the Giants bullpen and in the later innings, Romo and Kontos were warming up during a Dodgers pitching change. Josh Turner was due to lead off the next inning. He was standing at third starring absent mindedly at the Giants bullpen. Romo gave him a smile and a wave and then Turner pretended to bite his nails like he was nervous. They got a chuckle out of it and I thought some of you might too.  




 o/ 




 My underpants look like a Jackson Pollock painting!  




 Look for me on TV guys. I'm in the first row in front of the Giants bullpen wearing a red and black flannel.  




 Do you live here or are you just visiting?  




 Any word on AJ Ellis? That looked pretty bad last night.  




 What's the scouting report in Bolsinger? Never heard of him.  




 If you get there early, check out The Yard across McCovey Cove. They serve Anchor Stream beer and have a nice view of the bay.  




 Possibly. I haven't eaten yet, so my first mission is to get breakfast. I'll see how long that takes.  




 My plan is to leave the Sunset by 11 via MUNI, so I'll be at the park by 12.  









 Just bought a ticket for row 1 down the third base line. I'm probably going to interfere with a live ball and end up on sports center.  




 Does anyone know how good Puig's English is? I was under the impression that he didn't speak it, but last night I saw him yelling something to Joc and of course there was the yelling match with Bumgarner last year.  




 You should look into another online sports book. Bovada generally has worse odds than 5Dimes, for example.  




 I'm eyeing stub hub for some last minute deals. Does anyone know if you have to print your tickets or can you just have them on your phone? I might not buy until I'm already at the park. 


Edit: and do prices generally drop significantly 1 hour from game time as opposed to 4 hours from game time?  




 I was wondering the same thing. He's also the right fielder and a left handed hitter was up.  




 [Yes!]( http://theyardsf.com) 




 Stoked for tonight. I got a great deal on some great seats through stubhub. Going to get down there early and have some beers at The Yard. I haven't been to a game at AT T in probably 6 years.  




 Just any solar company?  




 If she talked as much trash as I do, absolutely not.  




 You win one MVP award and everyone thinks you're worth watching... /s 




 I'm literally 20 minutes from the ballpark at my sister's house, but she doesn't get the game, so I'm sitting here, watching Tosh.0, following the game thread.  




 I'll make a post tonight about a Thursday meet up. It would be nice to put some faces to usernames in this sub.  




 I'm going with family tomorrow, so I won't be able to, but I'm down to meet up Thursday.  




 I haven't been to a home game in probably 6 years because I moved to SD. I'll be there tomorrow and probably Thursday. I can't believe how cheap tickets are going, especially for a Dodgers series.  




 $7 tix on stub hub. Get to the yard, folks!  




 Stubhub has tickets for $13. So tempting, but I have baked potatoes and steak cooking and probably won't be able to get there by game time.  




 Just landed in SF. Going to the game tomorrow, but where is the best place to watch tonight? I've watched at Underdogs before, but it's going to be packed for taco Tuesday, so I doubt I'll get a table.


Edit: I'm desperate for a place in or near the Sunset to watch the game. My sister doesn't get CSN.   




 Haha yesterday was my first time at a sports book and I was confused by both of those things. You give them the rotation number and they give you cash when you cash out. The woman took my tickets, went to the back where I assume there's some kind of machine that separates the winners from the losers and tells her how much to pay me. She came back and gave me the cash. 


I was and still am confused when betting spreads. Last night I picked 1234, or whatever the rotation number of the Pelicans, to cover. I just said, "1234 to cover." Is that correct or should I have said something else?  




 How does that work? You just put it in an envelope, send it to the casino and then they send you an envelope of cash back?  




 Damn...I made my bets this afternoon at the Flamingo.  




 Good call. I'm there now.  




 I'll be in Vegas by 4, so I think I'll be ok ;-) 




 Damn, I was going to go to this game but decided to take the 9am flight back to SF. Now I'm sitting at the airport because the flight is delayed.  




 As far as I'm concerned, Heston has earned a spot in the rotation. Right now he's one of the top 5 pitchers on the roster.  




 I'm gonna need a gif of that curveball.  




 What a play! I'm not even mad. 




 Duffy looking like the x-factor early on this season. 




 If there's runners on first and second or if the bases are loaded and there is a pop up on the infield, the umpire will call the infield fly rule. This means the batter is out whether the ball is caught or not. It's to prevent the defense from intentionally dropping the ball in order to get a double or triple play. 




 He's there because they want him to play everyday. He'll get plenty of time in the majors eventually, but he's not going to get better sitting on the bench.  




 And I left in the 14th inning :-( 









 [July, 6, 2011]( http://m.mlb.com/video/?content_id=16698437) 









 Anyone know how many times he's been ejected in his career? The Giants' announcers were saying they have never seen him argue before.  




 I think he clearly went, but what's up with umpires not using the help?  




 Joe Madden would do it.  




 When did Duffy become a stud? He hasn't had a bad AB this year.  




 That's the most success he's had on a big league field.  




 Mays

Bonds

Marichal

Arias 




 Joaquin Arias is the GOAT. 




 Ryan "Wheels" Vogelsong  




 Matt Kemp must have used all his DL time to take notes on the Dodgers pitchers.
