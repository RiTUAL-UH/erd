 So was True Grit. And I think both surpass their originals. 




 I'm assuming they didn't film this powwow, but imagine if they did. That would make the best special feature of all time. 




 Yeah okay I'll see you fuckers next season. 

I'm gonna avoid this place till then. 




 Honest question: why do people think this? I really didn't think he did very well at all in Guardians.  




 Which one is this? 




 This guy sounds like a cousin of Jesse Eisenberg. 









 Your dog looks like Biggie.  




 [He slipped](http://imgur.com/Ycy0RJZ) 




 I'd be forced to watch Now You See Me while gagged so I can't argue with my idiot friends who think it's brilliant. 




 Chris and Aaron are so great on the podcast. 




 I hate anyone who appreciates this. 




 RemindMe! 4 days 




 Gas Pedal 




 [The set at the beginning was used in the episodes of Kenan and Kel where Kenan moved to Montana.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdx_QLP_69Q#t=295)

How do I know this

 Oh shit 




 How did it not smear like a mof? 




 Because manly men Bane swole. 









 Somebody likes LSD. A lot. 

Great work though.  




 I only watch Table Talks at this point, and only ones with casts I like. I save em up and listen to several in a row in podcast format. 

The other news videos just seem redundant to me and I don't care about any of the nerd stuff, and the cheesy format is off-putting to me. 

Oh well, I don't care enough to unsub or anything, but I only watch probably 10% of what they put out compared to the 90% or so that I used to watch with the original bunch.  




 I didn't like it either but to rank it behind Batman and Robin is just fucking absurd. Care to explain? 









 In terms of entertainment, check out the Tropic Thunder commentary. 

In the film, Robert Downey Jr's character says "Man, I don't drop character 'till I done the DVD commentary", and he doesn't. 




 Good lord. It looks rotoscoped or something. That's amazing. 









 That one doesn't even look good on here.  




 Memphis TN. Johnny Cash- Big River 




 Shadow on the Wall - composed by Mike Oldfield - sung by Roger Chapman 









 The audio is overlayed with the video. ScreenJunkies is classy enough to not verbally assault the guy, however weird he may be. 




 Somebody mix that shit 




 Moon 




 Thats putting it lightly. 




 Boogie Nights, The Social Network, The Master 




 I bump "Looking Out My Backdoor" in my car and smack the roof like in The Big Lebowski regularly. It keeps me going. 




 I didn't see it so much as movie about the concept of doubt. I saw it as a set of character studies. 




 Doubt is so fucking good. 

And any McDonagh movies play out like stage plays, mainly considering Martin was a playwright before he was a director. (By the way, read some of those. I love the Pillowman.) 




 Ow. 




 I am so okay with this.
 




 Renner took over the Bourne series, and soon he'll take over the Mission Impossible series. Then I guess Die Hard and James Bond? 




 Burnie

Fargo

Animal Kingdom

Blue Ruin 




 The Fighter.

But really any movie where I walk out calling characters by their names instead of the actors.

 




 WHY 




 This is actually the voice of Geoff, Craig Ferguson's robot-skeleton sidekick on the Late Late Show. He also does a perfect Morgan Freeman and DeNiro, among others. 




 I love the drummer playing along to the video. Synchronizing little beats with the machinery.  




 Just noticed they reused two shots of Bourne's foot on the railing and Bourne in between two windows. Kinda lazy. 









 I don't get it. What's the message here? 




 Nah. He's better as a character that pops in for a gag. 20 minutes of pure Kreiger would oversaturate it. 




 Not even a black neighborhood. One of the whiter areas of Memphis, actually. 




 McDonagh's brother made those. McDonagh's can do no wrong. 




 Oh hey I know the guy that got beat up.

 Sriracha makes everything edible. Worth every penny.

Lots of great discussion on there about hallucinogenics. Look into DMT for some even crazier shit. 




 My cousin's friend took the roommate personality match exam or whatever going into college and paired her with a 95% match. 

Her match wore a cape and fangs and swore to be a vampire. 




 Guardians of the Galaxy.

Sorry. I didn't genuinely laugh once and I didn't care about anything that was happening or any of the characters. Above that, I thought it was boringly written and I thought Bautista, Saldana, and half the other characters did a cheesy job with already cheesy enough lines. I love Pratt in Parks   Rec, Cooper in everything, and I like James Gunn as a director. I was really looking forward to it. In the end, I didn't even appreciate it as a fun, cheesy, space-opera. Maybe I'm heartless. I'm guessing y'all will think I am. 




 Can't wait to be lectured about cell phones ruining society and interaction in a quirky fashion. 









 Where's Rachel? 




 Good animation? That movie looked shit, even for the budget.

 Is your sim Ray Narvaez? 




 Jesus, man. I don't want to induce a panic attack. 




 God, Manhunter is such a good movie.  




 Yup. That being said, I fucking love Elba and would kill for it to happen. 




 He's said it's not going to happen. Plus he's already 41 and Craig has 2 more movies to do. 




 Reminds me of that episode of Wallander 




 Foreshadowing of Jessie's wiring scene - Bravo, Vince! 









 Make prints and they'll sell like goddamn hotcakes. Beautiful. 




 I figured I get hate for this. He is a great actor, but recently I watched The Way, Way Back and I couldn't take him seriously at all. Especially if he puts on a weird voice behind some makeup. Knowing Miller I'll probably still love this movie, but damn if it doesn't seem like it might be hard. 




 [And an amazing soundtrack.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI4iCx7LnbY) 




 Fuck. Yes. 




 I will not be able to take this seriously. I love Bennet Miller, but I really dislike Carrell in serious roles. Also, not big on Channing Tatum. 




 Good God that video was entrancing. This guy is great. 




 Junior in High school looking to go to an art college. I've done some research, but want to hear about real experiences from real people.

And yes, I am sure I want to go to art school. Don't be one of those people. 




 Don't forget Em. No one that has dissed Eminem has gone on to do anything of note. 




 Who the fuck hasn't seen The Dark Knight?
