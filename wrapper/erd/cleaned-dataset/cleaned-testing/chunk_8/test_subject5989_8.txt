 I guess you wouldn't mind coming to Canada to help me out with my rims? I'll buy you a case of beer? lol 




 Want to be friends?  




 Are there places that do this type of thing? I'm very unhandy and I live in an apartment so I don't have any space for something like this lol 




 How'd you do those? Looks amazing. 




 Do you go out to restaurants often? I'm in Toronto and I've never seen Nachos without it to be honest. 




 Lettuce is extremely common, no idea what part of Canada you live in because I'm Canadian too lol 




 You should be head of marketing for Chipotle good Sir. 




 and? 




 This makes me sad, if I were in charge of things the majority of the worlds budget would be going towards space exploration! :D 




 Can't get hyper blue in Canada yet, waiting till then to upgrade my 14 Impreza
