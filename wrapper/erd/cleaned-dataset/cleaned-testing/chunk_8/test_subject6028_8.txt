 The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly and infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre.

I picked this up because the other book I bought had a "buy one, get cheapest half price" sticker on it and the man at the till recommended it. It's an easy read and I've almost finished it. I'm interested in how the author plans to end it.
