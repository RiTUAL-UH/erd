 Appreciate such a comprehensive response!

You are correct in identifying them as Stafford loans(4/6 of them are anyway).

To your questions:

1) I do not have an emergency savings. I just started building it up a couple weeks ago, opened a savings account and designated auto-deposits. 

2) About 5% of my monthly income.

3) Stable as it can get. Catastrophe a la financial crisis is really the only scenario I see losing it, but let's be honest that could happen at any moment these days.

Sounds like the best strategy is to allocate all of my extra $ (my  goal is for 50% of monthly income) towards emergency fund and loan payoff. Having the mindset of paying off the loans being the equivalent of a 6.8% ROI is the best way for me to rationalize it.

Thanks! 




 Thanks for the response. I think this is the type of plan I'll take, as reluctant as I am to put off the investing. 




 Appreciate the advice, this is likely the road I'll go down. Definitely feeling the ETF game. 




 Do you have any friends that can give you adderall?

Obviously if you have any heart/respiratory issues you shouldn't take it, but this could easily give you the edge that puts you into passing.

EDIT: Keep in mind a lot of these practice exams are by design more difficult than the actual test. Don't let your scoring on these affect your confidence. There's a good chance you're actually just as prepared as you need to be. Don't give up! 




 For a robot, you are extremely helpful. You have my thanks. 




 I have about ~$14,000 left to pay in student loans. The interest rates on these vary from 5.35% - 6.8%. 

I'm anxious to put money into investments and save, but obviously I see the benefit in just paying these off. Do these rates seem particularly high/low to those with experience?

Thanks 




 Finally some sound advice. 




 Vanguard has a pretty responsive customer service team. I've encountered technical issues like this one before and they've been swift to help me. Worth giving them a call. 




 Good for them, was a childish move on Wealthfront's part. This all does seem rather petty though. 




 Schwab's definitely the better option, but pretty sure their minimum's are all $1000, OP seemed to indicate he only has around $200 to throw around. 




 1) Sell shares
2) Invest $200 into Betterment or a similar tool (http://investorjunkie.com/best-robo-advisors/)
3) Read the Intelligent Investor

If you're super intrigued by the market, start a virtual stock exchange game and mess around with play money. If you have friends that are interested you can make it more fun/competitive, almost treating it like a fantasy football league. 




 Yeah plan is to put in at least $500 a month. 




 I read a review that seemed skeptical of how sustainable their business model was. 




 Yeah that's true. If I'm at let's say 2k and a life event happens where I can no longer invest money for some time, it will be good to already have set up. 




 I'm just starting to allocate funds to savings, so I'm only starting with a few hundred $ at the moment. My plan is to stick with Betterment for a few months, once I reach $3,000(the minimum for most Vanguard accounts) I'll transfer it over to them.

I've heard people complain about the Betterment fees, but honestly an annual .35% charge over a 3-4 month period doesn't bother me.

Is this smart? Should I just be keeping it in a Savings account until I hit the 3k?

Obligatory thanks for the people in this community. I've had questions before and the responses are always super helpful. This sub is one of the main reasons I've wisen'd up and started to manage my finances seriously. 




 Hey thanks again for this recommendation. I found a copy on a ebay a couple weeks ago, recently finished it up. I found the artwork and the story VERY impressive and intriguing. Was curious to know your take on it. I felt that there was more to the story that was as you said "between the lines" that I was missing. Any thoughts? 




 Places to go/avoid, favorite places for fun, unique activities to do... 




 This is terrific 









 Any chance you have a link to the high pitch prank call? 




 I'm a big ol' investing noob. I bought 60 shares of a stock NKA at around $2 back in February. My intention was just to hold, and monitor the stock as more of a learning experience(I couldn't motivate myself to really follow any stocks unless I had money invested). Anyway, it was recently announced that NKA is going to be purchased, with shareholders receiving a little over $4 in cash for each share. The price skyrocketed to about $3.75 when this was announced. My inclination is to just wait for this buy-out to happen and take then $4 a share. However, what if something goes wrong in the purchase? Should I just take the profits I have now and sell all my shares at 3.75?

Wanted to see what some members of this community would do if they were in my position.

P.S. This subreddit is awesome. I've learned so much just by reading through the comments section and following discussions. 




 Recently starting looking through Incal and was blown away by Moebius' artwork, interested in hearing what different tastes/styles people are into- 




 Super impressed with what the illustrations look like in Blacksad and Mouse Guard, looking forward to checking them out. 




 That article pretty much completely sold me.

Also Blacksad...cannot wait to get this, artwork is looks stunning. 




 I bought the first one a couple weeks ago and haven't dove in yet, looking forward to it. 




 Wow....artwork looks amazing.  




 Yeah I had that recommended to me earlier and am very intrigued. 




 Reviews I'm reading for it are through the roof, thanks for the suggestion. 




 Nice I'll check out Superman. Have been reading others praise for Nightly News and Pax, both look great. 




 Definitely going to hit up Moore's other works, Kingdom Come looks awesome, thanks. 




 This looks fantastic. Any suggestions on where to find a copy? Amazon doesn't seem to have much... 




 I'm new to the comic book scene, and have recently been engrossing myself in the more iconic graphic novels (alan moore and frank miller). 

I care a lot more about the writing/illustration quality, moreso than the subject matter itself that's being dealt with. Not too sure what direction to look in for this, or how to narrow down my choices, hoping this community would have some suggestions for me.

I'm currently reading Watchmen which I love, and have heard many great things about the Sandman series. 




 Ha, yeah probably the best mindset to have. 




 Yeah, that is pretty ridiculous 




 Haha!

What are you retarded? Of course I'm Godamn Frank Miller! 




 Nice, thanks! 




 Nice, looking forward to checking it out. 




 Yeah this is what intrigues me so much about it. Reinterpreting a character is a very interesting exercise, and it's pretty much impossible to do without alienating fans, especially for a someone as iconic as Batman.   




 Maybe it's because I don't have any attachment to the character due to my inexperience reading these, but casting him as almost an antihero is super intriguing.

What were your thoughts of TDKR? There's dialogue in there quite similar to the screenshot you posted. 




 Yeah that's pretty disappointing to hear. 




 Any critics in particular that you'd recommend? I've been reading a lot of reviews for different comic books but it's hard to gauge how in line my taste is with the respective critics. 




 Cool, thanks for the reply! 




 Appreciate the feedback, very well written and interesting. Your last sentence in particular I find fascinating, because if he pulled off a "Sin City in a Batman cowl" it would appeal to me greatly. Any suggestions for graphic novels that might be in this direction? 




 Honestly this makes it appeal to me even more. 




 I'm new to comics and recently finished TDKR series and Year One. I loved both, blown away by them. Both of the series I mentioned in my title apparently received quite negative reviews. I plan on reading them, but am curious how this community feels as to why there was such low reception. Some of what I have read is that Batman is depicted as being too dark/gritty, bordering on a psychopath, but to be honest that makes these appeal to me even more.

 I don't mind having to pay for it. I have had a difficult time finding efficient ways to convert .mkv files into manageable files that I can easily edit. Many of the instructions I have found seem quite round-about. 









 I've got a couple weeks of funemployment coming up and would like to spend as much time out of the apartment as possible. Any suggestions on activities to partake in/places to explore?

Game 7 tonight let's go rangers! 




 For those that don't remember Sean Hoare was the whistleblower in the NewsCorp phone hacking scandal back in 2011. 




 Dude's a pussy. 









 Basically, a book that is as close to the film Eyes Wide Shut as possible. 









 Do you happen to know the exposure details you used? 




 Matt Moore 




 A top prospect they has/is coming up. Kris Bryant, Byron Buxton, Carlos Rodon...a top, young player. If I were you I'd hold on to him though, dude looks like a stud. 




 Let me start by saying I don't even agree with the suspension, I think this whole thing is overblown. But if an "independent source" isn't actually independent, it matters considerably. Imagine if the NFL had originally said they didn't pay Wells for the report and that a did it on his own. 




 This isn't to rant about the quality difference between 3D/The way it was meant to be seen, if you're into the gimmick that's your thing. I'm in the NYC area and every theater only offer IMAX with 3D, people from other areas having the same issue? 




 Fair point, but this is still significant. 









 Cool thanks, what genre would you describe them as? 




 Good to know- thanks 




 I find that a lot of techno songs quickly devolve into something with a loud thumping base throughout the entire track. The Prodigy doesn't do this, any suggestions for similar artists?
