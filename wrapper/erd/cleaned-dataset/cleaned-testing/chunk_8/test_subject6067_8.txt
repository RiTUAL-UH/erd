 Teamwork!  




 Just adding to what happyjoylove said.  Next time you decide to use a ton of liquid oils just make sure you do a steep water discount.  That will help with the cutting and curing time :) 




 Thanks for keeping us updated with what's been going on!  We've just been looking around at different lots in LA.  Seems like everything affordable is crazy sloped :(

 Agreed! We just made a costco run today for bagged chips, cuties, crackers, gum, water, and stuff to make sandwiches.  After our first year of eating nothing but nachos in hall h... we've learned that bringing pre made sandwiches were the way to go.   




 I think it's a dry small pomelo .. They usually get really big with huge flat seeds inside. Sometimes they are sweet and juicy , but sometimes they are dry.  *edited for spelling

 Hi!  My insurance is offering full body CT scans and a few of my coworkers have had it done.  I'm wondering if these scans are safe and how accurate they really are.  I really don't want extra radiation if it's not necessary.  What do you guys think?

 




 That would be such a cool Halloween costume! 




  Hi Fanky1356, I'm guessing that you're 17 and you really have a long time ahead of you to figure out stuff like that.  Only through more life experience will you then figure out who you really are.  I'm in my early 30's and I still surprise myself.  Try to enjoy your life and do as much traveling as you possibly can :) 




 A strong flushing toilet.  Just came back from a road trip and we stayed at 5 different Airbnbs.  There's nothing better than your own toilet at home :) 




 Garden tomatoes taste so much better.  I never really appreciated eating a tomato raw until I had one fresh from the garden. 




 BACHANNAL!!!  That's the only buffet I've been to where I wished I had another stomach to eat more food.

 Hannibal Buress and Bill Burr ! Ronny Chieng is pretty hilarious too.

 That's what cell phone games are for :D 




 I want to know who stared at the dogs asshole long enough to notice it, and then brave enough to point it out. 




 The photos of women and men they use for advertisements.  As a person that has shot and retouched for a living.... trust me.  Nobody looks like that naturally. 




 Have you tried the coconut milk version?? Omggggggg delicioussss  




 Those Mama Tom Yum instant noodles.  Especially with an egg in it. I can eat it every day if it wasn't for the crazy amount of sodium in it. 




 French fries.  Always french fries.   




 The thumbnail photo made it look like you were fingering air... lol.  The kitty is a cutie!
