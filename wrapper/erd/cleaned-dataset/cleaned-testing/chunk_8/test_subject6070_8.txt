 I have a similar situation at my school, I can make recommendations but a parent can override me. I have a student who is intelligent enough to do the work but has no work ethic he will make a c in my class. He will fail ap English and make a cs and bs  in his other classes . we have all recommended he take cp next year but his dad insist he take honors class. It sucks because it really throws the who dynamic of the class off. 




 Hahaha that's fantastic 




 I have a masters degree a great job stable relationship several interesting hobbies I probably smoke less than the average ent  but I still smoke. Rarely drink life is good happy 4/20 




 I think baby sunscreen has an obvious white cast so parents can see where they apply it 




 When someone says irregardless  I kind of hate them . it isn't a real word and if I correct you I am a dick 




 We have a winner take all system meaning that if one guy gets 49%of the vote and the other guy gets 51% then he gets the seat in congress for his district. So smaller parties never have a chance to win a portion of the seats like they do in other countries. Also the bigger parties often take the ideas of smaller parties so there is no need to vote for them. 




 Man that sucks sorry you had such a bad time with them. I lived across the street from them when they opened up on spring street and was so sad when they moved to King street.  




 Black bean has some good wraps and some of the best vegan cookies in town . it isn't amazing but good for a quick bite. 




 Hey fellow Charleston vegan couple of places to check out delz up town,  black bean co, co Asian restauraunt, octobachi, fig and Macintosh have great veggie plates and butcher and bee mez plate is great too. Let me know if you have any questions .  




 In a similar situation needed to read this so badly because some days I feel like the distance will never end. 




 Depending on where you live tour guide could be a viable option. Camp counselor during the summer and somewhere like they boys and girls club during the year. Or you can try and sub it out for another year. Best of luck. 




 I went to an eating disorder clinic many years ago not as a vegan but as a vegetarian. When I checked in I was allowed to list 3 things I wouldn't eat I chose chicken beef and pork (I figured they wouldn't serve much fish and I was right) after three days of complying with the menu they gave me I was allowed to  choose the foods I wanted as long as they met my dietary requirements so I actually never ate meat while I was there had yoghurt a couple times and eggs once when I didn't get to choose. I hope this helps put you at ease a bit . I have been in recovery for 6 years its a hard battle but I am much happier now than I was back then. If you want to talk inbox me. 




 Yeah my family stopped asking after about 10 years crazy that it takes a decade for your family to take you seriously. I always think , if I had changed my diet to lose weight and lost 50 lbs would they ask if I had gotten fat yet?  




 The same thing happened to me ...its be 17 years so not just a phase I suppose . 




 Opportunity cost is it worth it to loose the person you are with to experiment? It may be but it might also do a lot of damage. I feel like some times my bisexuality starts kicking in when I am unhappy in my current relationship and instead of dealing with it I start fantasizing about the sex I am not with.  I am very happy with who I am dating now and even though I have attraction to both sexes it isn't something I want to act on. Not saying this is what is going on with you but just thought I would share my experience. 




 Your options would probably to bus tables at a restaurant and work your way up. Unless you know someone it is unlikely they will pay you to learn to be an electrian . Charleston is a popular city and jobs can be difficult to come by especially down town. In the city a one bedroom will run you 700$ to 1200$. Their is a party scene here so if you are looking to grow up it also might not be the best place. Not trying to be negative but just trying to be honest. Best of luck what ever you decide. 




 OK sorry didn't mean to step on toes 




 Unfortunately sex Ed usually falls to PE teachers instead of science teachers. So there is a gap in knowledge .  




 Its pretty common to make jokes in any stressful situation. It bands people together and makes the stress more manageable. Its called gallows humor , not soulless completely normal human reaction . 




 I am currently cf and have always kind of been neutral about it. I never desperately wanted kids and I never felt like I would hate having them  either. I kind of always thought well if it happens it happens. So when were you sure you didn't want kids? 




 Letters mean more than you can imagine, they are by far my favorite gift! I had a student give me a book that they thought I would enjoy which was really sweet as well. Congrats on graduation I am sure your teachers are proud. 




 This is actually a great interview question because it gives you insight into someone's knowledge of what is acceptable behavior for the work place 




 Oh I thought he was talking about a section hike . Yes find a person who can care for your pets for that length of time.  




 You could pay a neighbor to take care of them (this is what I do) they already live right next door so it isn't too inconvenient, and they can make some cash. Or you could pay to board them in a kennel.  




 I read a little history of the world and watched some crash course us and world history videos to brush up on some of the things I hadn't studied in a while. Wasn't too bad look at the practice test it was very similar to the actual test. 




 Yes people need to be their own advocate , but just like asking someone who you don't know is pregnant if they want to sit is a bit uncomfortable , so is asking someone to give up their seat so you can sit. 




 Yes you should give up your seat to anyone who is in need... pregnant, elderly, disabled, here take my seat. For no other reason than it is the right thing to do. You can not like kids and still like people. And I am sure I will get down voted to hell for saying this but sometimes this sub is less about being child free and more about hating kids. I like kids I don't have them because I like my freedom more . pregnancy is difficult for most women and if I can ease someone's suffering a bit by standing on the metro then I will. 




 For anyone who is interested in a non harmful way to trap  a mouse I used something like this when I was in Africa a few years ago http://m.instructables.com/id/Simple--No-Kill--Mouse-Trap/ 




 I thought it was a museum but I wasn't sure. I just think it is so cool that they left them up and the little flower garden on the other side is so sweet. 




 You look lovely, so fresh and dewy.I have been using their powder for years and love it but now I am in my late twenties and it started setting I to my fine lines. I just bought the liquid foundation and it still has the same glow and doesn't break out my sensitive skin.  




 It is beautiful but I have always found plantations to be off putting because of all the suffering that took place there.  




 There is this park right at the corner of Calhoun and Rutledge (Cannon Park)  it has these amazing columns that are left over from a building that burned down it is really beautiful and not a typical Charleston proposal spot.   




 This made me so happy ! I think that is such a creative solution.  




 That's kind of what I have going right now and it works OK. I was actually thinking about getting a small tackle box to put everything in , but it just seems really bulky 




 Hey MUA I have been following this sub for a while and my make up skills and collection have greatly improved. I was wondering if anyone has a make up bag that they love. I travel pretty regularly and would like something that can hold most of my make up but isn't huge. Any advice would be great.
