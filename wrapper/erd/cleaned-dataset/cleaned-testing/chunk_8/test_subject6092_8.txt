 We got a grease man.  




 Do I start Gio Gonzalez tonight against the Mets or Anibal Sanchez tomorrow against the Royals  




 It's beautiful seeing us play well and beating Boston. Most of my friends are Red Sox fan and they all said we would be dead last in the AL East and that this is the worst Yankees team in a long time. It's lovely to see us in first place, even if it's only the second of May. 




 You just gotta work at it. It sounds like you need to work with adding, subtracting and dealing with negatives. That's the base you need to build to regain your math. Trust me, it's possible you just need to be determined to do it. I used to hate math, but I realized that I need it for what I want to do after college and this really helped. In my free time I would work on building my basic math and I've tried to stop using a calculator all together and it's pretty spectacular how far I've come. I started in remedial math level courses in college and now I can do some multi step problems in my head.  




 But remember it's important to practice it the correct way, otherwise you're screwed  




 I love the song, I listen to it before I have to give presentations to get me confident and feeling good

 Well certain people are invited to be present at the draft, while some say yes others say no. It's really all about if they want the extra attention or not.  




 Well Joan of Arc was a dyke so she goes lesbo on Helen of Troy while Jeremy fucks Helen up the butt and Leo paints  




 The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 




 The Pet Rock just so I could then invent it and make money  




 Red Velvet 




 Wanna talk about it  




 Epidemiologist. Not bad considering that's what I want to be! 




 He's paid 15 million a year and since we have been winning we might as well play him and hope he works it out. 




 What a grab by Miller! 




 Anyone know why Betances was limping? 




 I am loving A-Rod more than I have ever. That man is a still a beast. It was a blessing in disguise having him gone last year  




 Ron Coomer, Raul Mondesi and not so obscure, but Ruben Sierra 




 I have xbox 360 so sadly I can't play the show. I'm wondering which MLB2k game offers the best franchise mode. I'm just wondering overall, because I have MLB2k10. I'm at the all star break and there are 7 pitchers with a sub 4 era. In the 2010-11 real MLB season there were 11 guys with a sub 3 era and roughly 25 with a sub 4 era. My main concern is stat simulation realism I guess. 

THANK YOU 




 The first game of the season I went to was our win against Boston and you could tell the fans knew he was gonna knock in some runs in his first at bat. If he hits over 275 and knocks in 20+ hrs I would say he's had a successful season and I'm sure most Yankee fans that want the team to win and do well this season are supporting him. 




 So 2k10 would be better than 11,12 or 13 




 Yeah 360 




 The earliest I've played was 2k6 I loved it 




 The Show is really the best I know. Sadly I've got xbox 360  




 So I currently have MLB2k10 and playing franchise upsets me because I'll notice the league leaders in ERA will have an era over 3.50 and only a few guys will be under 4.00. 
I'm really just trying to figure out if there's a mlb2k game out there that doesn't have these issues 




 Well I actually love Arod now :( and I don't think I ever saw a video of it outside of sport center the next day. They didn't say anything about it, you could barely make it out. It was against the Braves. It was either 05 or 06 




 Honestly she could win. Remember the anger in her eyes when Kenneth ate the teamsters sub? Those were the eyes of a killing machine!  




 Well someone could make the argument that we've never had a good president. I wouldn't agree with that, but the point I'm trying to make is that it certainly isn't unanimous that W was the worst president ever. I'm sure if we had a nationwide vote W would win, but that's only due to the recency of his presidency and the likes of Jon Stewart.  




 My girlfriend breaks up with me and I go to jail

 When I was in the second grade I tried impressing a first grader I had a crush on by spelling kindergarten and I couldn't spell it.  




 I don't think that's the case. A lot of people will argue we have had worse presidents. Educated people too. From Taft to Wilson, Coolidge to Reagan and even Clinton to Obama.  




 Benedict Arnold is from here!
