 I was asked by my aunt to film my cousins engagement. My question is should I use a Glidecam or a shoulder mount? I haven't used either before but I need to be mobile. 

Also, what are some tips or advice you can give me? I've never done videography before, just fictional shorts.  




 Do they have a number? Or do I need to go there? 




 How come they aren't in sync with what they show? It seems like they contradict each other, sending mixed messages. One says this is appropriate and the other says it isn't. Who makes up the FCC and the MPAA? 









 I think all the movies you listed are great. And I think Memento should be there with them. Like I said, a true film buff like yourself doesn't think Memento is a bold film, but the vast majority of average moviegoers do. So I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. 




 What would you consider difficult? It seems like you only consider a movie difficult if it's emotionally difficult, which is also a low bar. 




 The Maze Runner. I thought it'd be another bad young adult novel turned movie kind of thing. Went with a friend and I actually liked it a lot and thought it was a well made and above average. The ending got a little wonky I thought, but other than that I liked it! 




 The Tree of Life. I don't know how you guys feel about it, but I personally don't know anyone in my life who thinks it's good. That movie's a masterpiece. 




 It's hard to compare the two because Fight Club is this weird combo of surreal comedy/drama whereas The Game is a psychological thriller. I feel like The Game is more accessible to wider audiences because it's easier to get in to. It has a, for the most part, straight forward story that, while there may be a lot of twists, it's still easy to follow what's going on.

While on the other hand I find Fight Club harder to recommend to people because of how strange it is. It breaks the fourth wall, jumps around in time, lots of narration, it's very cynical, satirical, dark humor, at times offensive, and other times brutally violent all while maintaing this overall sense of humor and satire. I love it more than The Game, but The Game is much easier to digest. And because it's a lesser known Fincher film, I feel you'd have a better time finding people to watch it with that don't know about it, whereas Fight Club? Pretty much everyone knows about it.

All in all I like Fight Club more and think it's better than The Game, but I go to them for different reasons because they are different. While they are both good WTF movies. Fight Club only gets WTF towards the end while The Game is WTF pretty much throughout. Also, I find The Game to be Fincher's least Fincher movie, but that's just me. 




 Wait, so I don't remember anything from when Memento released. Was that pretty popular with audiences when it came out? Cause I didn't see it till years later and it didn't strike me as an entertaining popcorn flick. 




 The Master is not a bold film at all. It's great, but not bold. 




 By your logic then, Memento could totally hang with the likes of those films. You say what makes the movies you listed "bold" is that they demand something from the viewer. Memento totally demands the attention of the viewer as well as multiple viewings if you want to truly understand it all. You said Nolan isn't difficult or bold. Maybe to a lover of film like yourself. But to the general public he is. I know plenty of people that cannot sit through Memento or Inception because of the complexity of those films. To the average moviegoer, these films hurt your head to think about and they aren't the kinds of movies you can just turn your brain off for. 




 I think it's an instant classic. I think it will stand the test of time because there is nothing really modern about it. It's a movie that doesn't have a lot of modern technologies so it could've been made any time. It also feels like an old school Clint Eastwood "Man with no name" kind of movie. Sixty years from now we'll look back and go, "Yep, still a great movie." 




 I think it's different with GTA because while you have the option to do it, it's still just an option. It's not the point of the game. But with Hatred that's the entire objective of the game.  




 David Fincher - The Social Network

Christopher Nolan - The Dark Knight(Hopefully Interstellar will change that)

Quentin Tarantino - Inglorious Basterds

Nicolas Winding Refn - Drive(Maybe, just maybe, Only God Forgives)

Terrence Malick - The Tree of Life

The way I did this was by picking my favorite Directors and picking which movie shows all of their tricks and techniques they've developed coming together and being perfected.  




 I still have a lot to see but so far...

The Rover

The Drop

Guardians of the Galaxy

Edge of Tomorrow

The Raid 2

The Lego Movie

The Grand Budapest Hotel

X Men: Days of Future Past

22 Jump Street

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Under the Skin

Gone Girl 




 There is a video I love but haven't been able to find. The video is of a guy in a fast food place saying something about fighting. He then puts on his motorcycle helmet and wraps one arm around his head, and flails the other arm. All of his friends then start laughing. It was also filmed on a phone. I have no idea what it was called and I cannot find it anywhere. Help? 




 I just wanna see Birdman. It's apparently not playing anywhere in or around the city. What's up with that?

We get The Guest which is a super small indie film, heck we get small indie films all the time, why wouldn't we get a star studded film that has gotten critical acclaim?

Is it the theater choosing not to show it or is it the film distributer not wanting to show it here?

Just thought it was super weird. Memphis theaters are always unpredictable when it comes to indie films, but I thought Birdman would surely be here. 

Anyone know of any place that is showing it that I'm just unaware of? I only checked Malco and Ayjay cinemas. Are there any other movie theaters in or around the city? 




 I think you're both right. Everyone should stop listening to/reading biased opinions and do their own damn research. This goes for everything. 




 In Mormonism they are taught everyone goes to Heaven. There is no Hell, just different tiers of Heaven.  




 This is misinformation, Mormons don't believe in a hell so there's nothing they can damn you to. 




 I glanced over the doc(I'll read more in depth latter) and most of that stuff I'm aware of and hasn't really affected me. I'm definitely aware of the LGBT issues due to my cousin being gay. I can't say I agree with their stance on that. I think that since I'm aware of most of this stuff it doesn't affect me. By that I mean I don't agree with most of it and I don't act out any of it. None of the stuff really directly affects me. Now if I was a woman, it'd be different because of how much it *would* directly affect me. 

Also, the last part bothered me. The part about only Mormons go to heaven and if you leave, you never see your family again. To the best of my understanding, that's entirely false. Everyone goes to heaven. There is no hell. The only thing is what level of heaven you go to. You will for sure see your family again even if you leave, because the family that stays will be able to visit you as often and as long as they want. You can travel to the lower tiers, you just can't travel to the upper tier(s) if you reside in the lower one(s). At least, according to the teachings.

Like I said, I'll continue to read more to inform my opinion better.

But I do want to thank you for the discussion. And I wish you the best as well. 




 The thing is though, is that I don't want to know if it's made up. In fact, I kind of just don't care if it's made up or true. If I leave, I'd rather it be because it's not right for me because of the way I live. I don't want to learn it's made up *because* my loved ones believe it. I wouldn't want to know it to be false and have my family believe it to be true at the same time. That would make things harder for me deal with. I've never been the kind of person to create friction. I wouldn't want *them* to start questioning it as well, because they're happy believing it. 

I've thought about my future constantly from both sides. How would it be if I wasn't Mormon? How would it be if I was? I can honestly see myself happy in both scenarios. But I can also see myself being unhappy in both as well. So I just take it day by day and have just decided to go with it. Let fate push and pull me where it must.

The way I see it, I'm happy with how I'm living now. I've found some weird equilibrium and for now, I'm okay with it. 

By the way, I wanted to ask you something. I was afraid to ask earlier because I was afraid you would think I was being snarky, but now that things are diffused, What's with your username? If you don't believe, then why that username? 




 I never once said that what was posted was anti Mormon. I also don't blindly follow this religion. I've seen a bunch of different perspectives. Heck, half my family isn't Mormon. If you were to watch me go through one day of my life you'd see that I'm not a good Mormon. I'm pretty much Mormon in name only. Yeah I don't do drugs or smoke or drink but that's just a personal thing that I've never been in to. But I do and support many things the church doesn't. You and I are not the same. You weren't in my shoes. I'm not saying your experience doesn't hold any value, but people have different lives. Things vary person to person. You said we were taught that questioning the church is a sin. I was never taught that. I was always told it was normal and it was up to us to do the research and figure out for ourselves if it was true or not. 

I'm always struggling with religion. Honestly maybe I don't care if it's true or not. Maybe I like believing there is a God. Believing in an afterlife and great plan for everyone. I stay Mormon not because I'm worried what other Mormons think, but because of my family. I mean they love and support me no matter what, even if I did leave, but there would still be disappointment. I also enjoy the community of the church. I go to the singles branch so no one there is pushy or preachy. They're all really cool and nice people that are around my age that are fun to talk to. 

I know you never said this, but I just wanted it to be clear that I'm not a hardcore devout Mormon blindly following a religion I know nothing about. I'm simply an impostor playing pretend because it's the easiest thing to do right now. Playing pretend until I can discover how I really feel on my own. I consider everything and rule nothing out. That's why I look at both sides. Yeah I may not do a lot of reading. I never said that was a good thing. I wasn't bragging about it. It's a flaw and I will have to read a lot to discover how I really feel. I realize everything I just said may seem hypocritical and might null everything I've said in previous comments, but that's the honest truth. 

I'm just a dude on the internet. 

 




 Well for one I never claimed to know the absolute truth. And I never said I was more right than a Jew or Catholic. I'm just a dude on the internet who likes movies and doesn't like reading. 

I also never claimed anything specific to be anti Mormon. Like you said, I probably never read the stuff you talked about. So it didn't really make since to me why you'd bring that stuff up when I never claimed anything specifically, and especially not the stuff you brought up, to be anti Mormon or hostile. It was all kind of irrelevant. You asking me what about all those publications is hostile is a weird question when I didn't say any of them were. You simply asked me to define "anti Mormon". So I did.  




 I guess people or things that aggressively oppose Mormons or Mormonism with hostility? I personally use it to describe things that are hostile and aggressively opposed to it. It's fine to oppose something, it's when it gets aggressive and hostile I'd start using the term "anti". Technically, you can totally be anti anything and not be aggressive which is perfectly fine. So long as no one is getting mentally, emotionally, or physically hurt. I didn't mean what was posted was anti Mormon (I didn't read it obviously) or you or anyone here specifically. I was just saying I read that stuff all the time. I mean you come across that stuff frequently on the internet often so you can't really avoid it. And I don't really try to avoid it for that matter. Like I said, I'll read anything, anti Mormon or not, as long as it's not too long. Or I find it interesting. So I guess I should correct myself, I hate reading unless it's something I truly find interesting or love, like film. I could read for hours about movies.  




 Well I mean 1) Your reply was one line. 2) it directly pertains to me because you're talking to me. So of course I did. I'd happily read anti Mormon stuff if it's like a paragraph at most. I don't have a problem reading things that question Mormonism so it's not an "ignorance is bliss" thing, it's a "I don't like reading so the longer it gets, the less likely I'll read it" thing.  




 Thanks, the way I've always viewed it, despite whatever I believe religiously, and whether I think it's true or not, I've always had a firm belief that church and religion should be separate from government and not influence laws and what not. 




 Naw not really. I just hate reading. That's a pretty popular feeling among the general public. I find it funny it's so hard for you to believe that I'm just a super lazy person who hates to read. Like I said before, if you ask me "why" I don't care to read it, I'll tell you why. 




 I'm sorry to hear that. My cousin is in the same situation and it's far from easy. In my comment that was a reply to your comment I was just trying to understand. I'll say you should definitely talk to your ex about it, which you might have done already because you're concerned about your daughter. But I don't know anything about your life so I'mma just shut up now. 




 Either your favorite current commercial that's recently been on tv, or just any one from your past that has stuck with you.  




 Never said I was temple worthy. I don't pay tithing. I'm not a good Mormon. I agree with you that it's not right to group the Mormons together as people because they're different person by person. That's been my problem with this thread. There's a bunch of people in here saying that Mormons are bad people and "love bombers" and malicious. I'm okay with people having problems with the church as a whole and certain individual Mormons, but when you start grouping them together and call me terrible because I'm Mormon that's when I get upset. I'm not like most Mormons because of my family. I have a gay cousin that I love and half my family isn't Mormon so I was raised to never judge people based on their religion but who they are as a person. 

I was downvoted earlier just because I told someone there are great people who happen to be Mormon and said that I was Mormon as well and just wanted everyone to be treated equally. Why? Who knows. I wasn't being dishonest, I was respectful and polite and non aggressive. 

My motto has always been "Live and let live. Don't worry about what other people are doing unless it directly affects you." 




 Eh, who cares what the church tells your daughter. You're her parent. You are the one who should be doing what's best for her. You say you don't like what they're teaching her, but if you aren't doing anything about it then you are part of the problem. Do something about it because like I said YOU ARE HER PARENT! You don't like what they're telling her? Don't let her go. The solution is there. If she's in primary then she is younger than 10, which makes me ask, if you don't like it, why take her? And if you aren't taking her, then who is? 




 No, I haven't. The reason is that I simply don't care to read it. If you ask me why I don't care or any other question, I'll definitely answer your question. But that's the simple answer: I just don't care. I'm not saying that to be a blind follower, I say that because I mean I don't care enough to read that much. I've just never been a reader in my life so when I saw how many pages I groaned, but I did read the first 8 pages. But like I said, if you ask me why I don't care or any other question, I'll answer it without a doubt. It just won't be in a timely manner because reddit won't let me do anything because of how many of my comments have been downvoted lately, but I'll answer! 




 I haven't thrown any money to Prop 8 or anything.  




 You know how people hate it when a religious person tries to push their religion and beliefs onto them? That's what this thread kind of feels like, but with the roles reversed. 

Now the non religious people are pushing their disbelief onto others.

It's all the same. We're all just as terrible. 




 This will sound stupid, but religion isn't about believing with your brain, but with your heart. Religion isn't about finding out if it's factually accurate, it's about faith. And it is up to the individual to choose to have faith or not. See, I always thought the people who call Joseph Smith a con man and call Mormonism a hoax are just as bad as the religious people who push their religion on others. It's the same thing, but instead of pushing their beliefs, they're pushing their disbelief onto others. People should just live and let live. Someone believes in something you don't? Who cares. You think it makes them an idiot? Who cares. I'm sure we all have more important things to deal with than worry about what someone else believes in. I'm not talking bout you specifically, relevantlife, I'm talking people in general including me.

I find myself constantly struggling with my beliefs, but in my experience, yeah I've seen people have a bad experience with Mormons and the religion, but I've also seen people's lives change for the better as well. Just like any religion or belief or whatever. But what do I really know? I'm just a person.

We are all just people. We can't prove (a)God exists and we can't prove (a)God doesn't exist, so that means we are all just arguing about who's hypothesis is better, which is why religious debates are so dumb. 




 If it means anything, there are some great Mormon people out there. I'm Mormon and just want everyone to be happy and treated equally with the same rights. I support a *lot* of stuff the church as a whole doesn't.

Edit: Kinda sucks that I'm being downvoted just for saying that I support equal rights and happen to be Mormon. 




 Don't you *ever* try to tell me how to live my life again. 




 This makes me think of how great the use of CGI is in Fincher's films. His CGI is never really in your face and is mostly subtle, which is why it's so great. If you watch his VFX breakdowns on his movies, you'd be surprised at what's CGI! 




 First I want to say I'm relatively new to DSLR filming. So I've been noticing a lot of noise when I do low light shooting. I believe I'm doing a good job at lighting dark scenes and having the right camera settings, but even still, I'm noticing lots of noise. Even when I use lenses that are great in low light situations. Are t3i's typically bad at low light situations and generally produce a lot of noise?

What are some good ways to prevent, battle, or fix noisy footage? And should I just invest in a better camera? 




 I'm late replying, but since no one else said it, if you super jump off of an edge you won't receive any fall damage. I super jump off of skyscrapers all the time and it feels awesome!  




 I was just saying that the piano scene was just a good scene in general, not specifically the cinematography, although I do think Spring Breakers is a beautifully shot film despite the quality of the film itself, which I like. And I do agree that Prisoners was beautifully shot. You might like [this](http://mattscottvisuals.com/blog/2014/1/10/-what-are-you-looking-at-disecting-the-work-of-a-master). It's a breakdown and examination of Prisoner's cinematography. 




 That piano scene though 




 Thanks! I sent you a PM 




 I was wondering when you'd show up! 




 Hey thanks for the reply! I sent you a FB message 




 It's Saturday at 10 am. Like I said, super short notice 




 As it says in the title, I have a short film scheduled to shoot on Saturday and my actor bailed. The equipment is already rented and props are bought. I could really use a miracle here. I don't even care if you're an actor or not. If you believe you can act and can appear menacing, please give it a shot.

If you volunteer please know it's unpaid(I'm broke) and it *is* a main role so one other shooting day will be in the future(October 25th). After that you're done. 

The role calls for a male actor. Age unspecified as well as race. The only thing is you have to look like someone in their late 20s or early 30s. Also, I can provide footage of the day 1 shoot to show we know what we're doing and this won't be a terrible home movie.

I'm in a terrible situation here and this is my last ditch attempt to save this project that has already been started and has had the heart, soul, blood, sweat, and tears of other people poured into it. Help? 




 Isn't she blind? 




 Preferably practical effects and make up and not cgi? Like videos that show ow they did something? 




 I'd like to consider myself a non-alcoholic drink connoisseur. I like trying new, different, unique drinks! Then I collect the bottles/cans!

I live in Tennessee, so I can exchange pretty much any american foods, or American foods specific to the south!  




 It's a French phrase that translates to "something something void"

Help! 




 The Tree of Life, The Matrix, Drive. Watchmen coming in as a close fourth.  




 Need some scrap and junk! 




 Like an actor/actress who was in some financially or critically successful movie and you thought to yourself, "They're going places!", but then their career sort of just fizzled out. 




 I didn't get into GTAIV until Gay Tony and the Lost DLC had already come out so I don't know how R* goes about releasing DLC info. I just thought it was kinda strange we hadn't heard a thing on any story DLC. Maybe I missed the news? Is this how R* usually is? When do they usually start releasing details for their story DLC? Just curious 




 Anyone have a mirror? Says the webpage is unavailable :( 




 I'm not saying dark is better. I just mean I appreciated Disney taking a risk and being ballsy with the Lone Ranger. The dude cuts out and eats another dudes heart. I do agree that there were bad tone shifts where it goes from dark drama to comedy adventure.  




 That navy ship segment in 3 Ninjas is really cool. As well as the paper mill segment in 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up  




 I also kind of appreciated how dark they went with the movie considering it's a Disney movie. 









 I feel lie this doesn't solve it because now, instead of waiting to see if one movie has a great ending, you're waiting to see if three movies have great endings.

You're still asking people to post a great ending movie, the only difference is that they are posting two other movies as well. You'll still be looking forward to the great ending, which is what you wanted to avoid. Only now you'll be disappointed two thirds of the time.  




 Jesus of Suburbia is still one of my all time favorite songs. 









 It's not though...it's a prop cigarette. It's the *exact* one I linked. I've used them tons of times in theater and shorts.  




 Fun Fact: The e-cig is actually a movie prop! It's a plastic cigarette and you screw in butt, and when you inhale, the end lights up. It's mostly for actors who do not smoke and wish to keep it that way. It's all just vapor!

 Without spoiling, is it bad? 




 Edge of Tomorrow - A Most Wanted Man - The Drop - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

I have not seen these movies yet but I *do* want to see them. Because of where I live and how long two of them have been out, when Friday hits none of them will be playing here anymore. I want to catch them before they leave the theater.

I'm working and going to school this week so tomorrow/today(Tuesday) is my only free day. And because of the showtimes, I only have time to see three of them. This put me in a position to make a hard choice!

Which of the four, without spoiling things, can I eliminate and wait to see on Redbox or something? Which three are the must see ones? I realize this all depends on my personal taste, but what do you guys have to say?  




 Which was an outrage. Oklahoma chick did ventriloquism while singing. New York drummed on a solo cup.

Edit: Ohio not Oklahoma 




 Naw ventriloquist girl should've won 




 Not that I'm complaining. But I was just thinking about how many films today have synthy, 80s inspired scores and looks to them. 

What movie started this? There was a time in 90s and early to late 2000s where most movie had typical cinematic scores and looks. But something changed and we started getting more and more films that have had their look and music inspired by the 80s. 




 You didn't mention it, but I wanted to say that GTA5 Online is pretty much zero fun unless you're playing with friends. 

Another thing: I feel like most multiplayer games aren't fun by yourself now a days because everyone is in a party or private chat with friends so it's super quiet if you're playing alone 




 Really surprised to see Apocalypto on here. Love that movie and it's not one that's brought up often when talking about great films. 




 What parts did they get right/wrong? 




 The Matrix blew my mind when I saw it.  




 See I never understood this. It's like saying, "I wish I wasn't rich because all this money is weighing me down."

I had extremely bad acne when I was a teenager. Luckily it's cleared up, but the acne scars severely hindered my ability to grow facial hair. Couldn't grow a beard if I tried. Should consider yourself lucky that you at least have the option to grow your beard out or not. You don't *have* to shave because the worst thing that'll happen is you get a nice beard. I have to shave because if I don't, I get this really ugly, messy patchy "beard".  




 Just bought a suit and was wondering if any of you guys have found a good tailor who isn't crazy expensive 




 Just in time for the holidays.  




 "Damn you, Salizar. **DAMN YOU, SALIZAR!**" 

Not the best movie but I regularly use this quote.  




 300 has my favorite shot from a film. This could be spoilers but near the end when Leonidas throws his spear there is a shot of the spear reflecting off of some gold stairs. You don't see the spear, you just see it's reflection as it travels over the steps. Beautiful shot! 




 Hey! I thought this post would've been dead by now! Glad you found it! I can't do anything this week due to a project, but next week, all week, I should be free.  




 Different game but you should check out Just Cause 2. That's the thing I loved most about that game. Three islands: one was all jungle and snowy mountains, one all desert, and one all city.  




 For real. I remember when the gtav trailer came out and it showed some hikers in the woods, that forest looked so dense.  




 A crime/drama about two criminals who escape the police by killing and stealing the identities of two hikers. 




 Really? Where at? 




 I might be willing to check it out
 




 Yeah this expansion has taken out everything I liked about Saints Row. It's not about gangs or crimes, it's not even semi-realistic or believable, and now they took out customization. Man, I can't wait for saints row 5.  




 No that's what I want though. Not specifically dead kids, but that feeling you get when you're looking at something sexy then, the next thing you know, you just watched someone die. 









 I'm working on an editing project in Final Cut Pro and it is insanely important that I get Motion 4. It is imperative to my project. I can't find Motion 4 anywhere! Does it even exist anymore? Did it vanish? Is there any way to get it?!

I would use Motion 5 but it removed vital features I need for this project. Features that 4 *did* have. Help! 




 The ability to send from FCP7 to Motion

 Recently I've been really into the opening scene from The Player. It's like an 8 minute long shot that's really complex because in this 8 minute shot it perfectly sets up every side story in the movie. Great shot and great opening.  




 Alright I sent you a message!  




 Or just any cool empty industrial sites? Looking to do some urban photography. Would be cool if the had some "nature taking it back" look to them but not necessary.  Really just any abandoned or dilapidated urban environments.  




 You don't have to convince me. I've got my button and everything. Wolfskull won me over with his confidence and charisma.  




 Yeah I always felt the spirit of this subreddit was a "so crazy it just might work" sort of thing. But a lot of these posts as of late are just things that don't make any sense at all. The Wolfskull thread was awesome and refreshing but now everyone is so blatantly trying to copy it.  




 What was it about Matthew McConaughey that changed? It's no secret that lately McConaughey has turned into one of Hollywood's "go to" guy as of late. He has turned his career around and went from being a joke to being one of the most talented actors working today. 

My question is, what was it that changed? Did McConaughey actually become a better actor, or did he just start choosing better movies?

I was watching Sahara, the adventure movie from 2005, and noticed that McConaughey himself hadn't really changed. It felt like the same Matthew that we are getting today. He still acted the same, yet I still felt like I was watching a not good McConaughey performance. I didn't *think* he gave a bad performance but it *felt* like a bad one, if that makes sense? 

So when did this change in McConaughey happen? And was the change with himself and how he acted in projects, or was it simply he started picking better projects? 




 Do you know where Memphis is? It's quite literally on the border of both Arkansas and Mississippi. Crossing either one of those state lines would take me about 15-20 minutes at most from where I live. It's not like I'm driving across a state. I've done it before to see movies that weren't playing in my city. 

Also, why are you even here if you're opposed to the idea of this subreddit? 




 Really not seeing the problem here. It's not like people will go over to each other's houses. People would be meeting at a theater which is a public place that is most likely to have a large crowd. Especially on a weekend. They'd also be driving separate cars. Honestly, this is no different from a simple reddit meetup. People do it all the time. I make short films and have used reddit to find and meet with local actors and crew members. This honestly is not rapey at all.  




 That's not very nice :( 




 Being an adult. 




 Man SF is fantastic. Too bad it's expensive to live there or I totally would move there. Working on saving up and building my resume. Maybe I'll make it over there. I wish your brother good luck on his endeavors. Maybe one day we'll meet and work together.  




 That I'll waste away my life doing nothing fulfilling or anything that makes me happy and I'll end up all alone and sad.

I want to get married. I want a family. I want a career I'll enjoy. Not getting these things scare me to death.

My co workers and friends thin I am. 

I know I'm not.

I have to keep them believing though.

 Launch nuclear missiles because a couple of comedy actors from another country decided to make an over the top comedy movie about assassinating you. 




 Get out, it's past closing time! Get out of my store!

Or, Everything here is over priced. Go shop online.

Anything to get them out of my store really. 




 If they could never move out I'd choose Ryan Gossling so I could pitch him all my movie ideas and he could never leave. 




 Fuck you, every time I forget, someone brings it back up! 




 My future and how cloudy and unclear it is.

 This girl is half his age? 




 Or alternatively, when *he* runs at *you* just turn around, bend over, and put your but on his penis. 




 What is this from? 




 When I was in high school some buddies and I went to shoot a video for our film class. We needed shots of planes taking off. So we thought it would be a good idea to go to our international airport and film planes taking off while we were on a dirt road that went between the runways. I was also wearing a ghillie suit. 

The next thing we knew three suv's with fully tactical cops came driving up. They made us erase all of our footage. We explained to them what we were doing. We found out they were pretty cool and joked around with us, and even told us where we could go to get permission to film planes. Then they let us go.

That situation could have gone so bad but lucky for us we were dealing with some cool cops. 




 My hot neighbor sunbathing by the pool.

Nah, just kidding. It's almost always a spider in a web. 




 Nothing? 




 If only it were that easy. We live in a world where things keep getting more expensive and jobs that pay well are getting hard to find. Moving is never easy. Especially to a new city where you don't know anyone.

Trust me, the "Get the Fuck Outta Here" savings account exists, but it's only slowly growing. 




 Yeah, there we go! There was, I think, a tv movie about it, but if I remember correctly, it wasn't good. 




 Something that could be used and applied to almost any situation. 




 California making movies because it's my dream. 




 Seriously thought about it once. I wanted to just backpack across the country or something. Maybe move to a new place and start over. 




 "Now *this* is pod racing!"

Which is usually followed by R2D2's "WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" 




 I convinced my friends fiance that I seriously thought I was immortal. We spent an hour talking about it. It was an Oscar worthy performance. I shed some tears and stuff. I don't think she believed that I was actually immortal, but I new she thought I was completely insane and needed help. 

Still haven't told her the truth. 




 Podcasts, dude. Podcasts. 




 When my older sister acts like my second mother. "test_subject6208 do this, test_subject6208 do that. No, test_subject6208, you can't do that. Take out the trash and clean the bathroom, test_subject6208." Ugh. 




 ThisPlaceIsAFuckingPitOfNothingnessThatIsSlowingSinkingIntoTheEarth, TN.

Why? Because it is. 




 I forgot who the skaters were, but that story from the 90s about the two competing figure skaters and apparently one of them got her boyfriend to injure her competitor by hitting her in the knee with a rod. They were *huge* rivals.

Anyways, David Fincher needs to get on this ASAP 




 Interviewing myself. I like walking around the house or neighborhood asking myself questions as if an interviewer was talking to me like I was a famous person for doing something. Usually making or staring in a movie. I play both parts and ask myself what the filmmaking process was like and what obstacles I faced while making the movie. As someone who actually *does* make movies, it often helps me work out problems I might be having with production.

But yeah, I know other people talk to themselves, but I don't think they assume roles and play all the parts. 




 PS4. Bought one at launch. Definitely did not need it right then and could have waited a year. But I don't regret it because I enjoy using Netflix on it. 




 Elect Terry Crews as President of the United States. Shaquille O'Neal is a close second, though. 




 Myself. 




 Necessarily. I can *never* spell it. Ever. I don't now what should be a "C" and what should be an "S". 




 Because it's slow 10 months out of the year so all I do for 10 months is stand in one place and price things for 6-8 hours. 




 Doubt I'm tagged as anything, but if I am I hope it's not as bad as I think. 




 Really hoping this sub takes off. I'm off tuesdays, thursdays, and my weekends alternate. Usually get off work around 7:30. I'm pretty much always game for a movie. 




 What about r/SaveYouASeat?

I would totally use this subreddit, but I doubt anyone from my city would use it. 




 I've been to a couple of weddings in the past month and have seen different types, and my best friend is currently planning his wedding. It got me thinking. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to give people the wedding of their dreams? 




 Cloud Atlas? 




 That'd be great! I can email you the picture if you want to pm me your email 




 That piano scene tho 









 Sorry, totally slipped my mind. I'm using a canon rebel t3i. 

My budget is like $200. Renting of course.  




 I don't know the quality of these items, so I'm looking for advice on if it's a smart buy.

 I'm looking specifically for a wide angle lens. I want to get some nice wide shots. I also need one that will not produce a lot of grain in the dark. Something that has great image quality in light and dark.

I'd be renting from [lensrentals](http://www.lensrentals.com/rent/canon/lenses/wide-angle) so from the options they have, which would be best? Which ones would be most versatile? 




 So is he implying that it will be like a 4 player co-op? 




 The Death Book-Ended one is interesting. How'd you come up with that? 




 It's a crime story about death.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By3l0nVnUv1hU0t4aEFRc3pWTVk/edit?usp=sharing) it is 




 I'm writing a short. Need someone to give me a title.  




 Oh yeah I've seen it. But it's been a while. I actually bought it on dvd a long time ago. It was also I think the first movie I ever blind bought. Couldn't find it anywhere then I just ordered the dvd. It's been one of my favorites since.
