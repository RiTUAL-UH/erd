 I regularly get surprised or thrown off looks when I thank people for small things, even in my family. Growing up in London, queueing and apologising profusely is what we are great at and so in China, I often get told by my uncle to stop apologising so much. 




 True dat 




 Aren't these basically it with the fillings adapted? 




 Guess I have my saturday night plans sorted 




 Ahh the Snail Bee essence has niacinamide too, how do you find it?

I love the recovery gel cream BTW, its heavenly, especially when I'm travelling in the summer. 




 The Mizon Intensive Night Repair Ampoule also has niacinamide too ;) 

Do you use any other actives? 




 How long can you get wear out of them before they start coming off? I'm looking for a long lasting liquid lipstick too and I think I might have to resort to the LA Girl or LA Splash ones, comparable to Stila Stay All Day and Limecrime Velvetines. 




 Yup, they do but its the old packaging.... so maybe older batches? 




 I have Instanaturals' Vit C serum and honestly wouldn't recommend. I bought it due to it being the top seller on Amazon but man, it did absolutely nothing for my skin. After 3 months, I have seen no improvement wit PIH and I don't think they hyaluronic acid has done anything for me either.

In terms of pH, L-AA forms of Vit C are most effective, but oxidise very quickly and will react with niacinamides to cause flushing.  




 Is it possible that they are heat rashes? If so, go to your local supermarket or pharmacy and ask for 'fei zi fen= ' I know Johnson's baby do one and it comes in a pouch (like a yoghurt pouch) and apply this on the areas and areas of high humidity like armpit, inner elbows, back of knee.

When I was younger, going to the south like Si Chuan and Jiang Su always broke me out in heat rashes as I couldn't acclimatise to the humidity or heat. 




 Sure, always happy to help a fellow ABer! Especially a UK one, there are much fewer of us here on this sub.

I do find that even with shipping, RRS tends to work out to be cheaper. I usually add things to cart, find costs of shipping and average it out per item and add this cost on and compare it to the shops with free shipping. 

If its your first order, I would recommend Jolse, purely because of the $3 store credit. Also, if you're buying a bunch of items from a specific brand, Jolse has 10% sales on certain brands every week- this week its Holika Holika and Innisfree. I guess you could split what you're buying this way as well if you don't mind having shipments every week. 




 Yep I do, I don't usually need one though unless I'm doing more than 3 coats.

I tried this one today and found that no wiggling and just having 1 coat makes it much better. I'll try layering this one up with other mascaras to keep testing 




 Yup!! Its one of the more popular online AB stores due to the lower prices of products (but high shipping costs) 




 Yeah definitely! I bought these products to target PIH specifically, I am using a SAP for Vit C but have seen no result after 3 months so wanted to buy some things with niacinamide to help brighten my scars 




 Well, I suppose the update was rebranded as a 're-opening'. I bought this as soon as the new website was live 









 Cat's Eye Pizza is pretty decent if you're feeling that faux hipster, young gen vibe. Their potato waffles and platters are good, plus you get free wifi 




 Eat: any street food- AHBVIOUSLY, one of Ba Da Lou if it's a family gathering 

Do: Play bridge with old wise guys, Yu Yuan Tan or just wander around

See: walking around parks after dinner, bad football at Gong Ti 




 Thanks! I'll definitely give this a go, I want it to be good so badly 




 I have ordered from RRS and Jolse and would definitely recommend them both, purely for ease of service (especially now RRS has made their website easier to use) and no problems with shipping and customs/VAT issues. I always pay for K-Packet Area 3 and it gets here within about 10 days or so, which is fairly decent. 

RRS's shipping fees are quite steep but you can avoid this by buying on eBay (tracking costs $2.50) but you can't add things to our basket and pay for them all in one go, so I still prefer their website if I'm ordering a bunch of items. I think paying for shipping on RRS is only worth it if you're buying a few heavier items.

Jolse also gives you $3 credit for just signing up and as shipping is free, they incorporate these costs into the item prices.

I have found both shops to undervalue their items by a lot and remember- EMS is a Customs/VAT issue honeytrap! Waiting a few more days and avoiding the hassle is worth it! Happy buying!! 




 Can I ask what other ones you use? I'll give the Kiss Me some more time but I really doubt it'll improve very much 




 Do you use the waterproof versions of those? We don't have the Full n' Soft waterproof in the UK, nor the L'Oreal telescopic :(
