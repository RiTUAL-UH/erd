 Actually you can with a brain scan. If you show a psychopath a picture of a starving child while getting a MRI brain scan the sections of the brain dealing with emotions will have little too no response. 




 An open mind is good but don't be so open minded your brain falls out.  














 What they don't realize is that the sleepwalkers are not interested in sites like reddit. 




 The gatekeepers are in the process of loosing there power. They are scared. Read book "The end of power" by Moises Naim. The centralized absolute power of the dark triad gatekeepers is becoming a thing of the past. 




 The new CEO must make reddit a safe place for future corporate advertisers.  




 Reddit is in the process of making this website a "safe place" for corporate advertisers. 




 "While not required". This is conspiracy section. Even if required I may break the rules. So f off bot.

 Yea but it is in there best interest too do so. The bean counters will never learn. 




 If Reddit management had any commonsense, rather than getting rid of free speech to satisfy PC corporate advertisers they could run a fund raising campaign from its 
users. PBS runs fundraising campaign for there ad free public television. Reddit should do the same. Harvard business school management style will not work with Reddit culture.  




 Reddit probably will keep conspiracy open. Classic misinformation tactic. Anyone who tell a truth that the powers that's doesn't want disclosed is a "crazy conspiracy nut".  




 The new CEO states that reddit was never a free speech forum and that reddit has  " dark side" 




 Yep.  "Learned helplessness" is not something the average uses of reddit is good at. F the gatekeepers. Have you seen the new "content policy". 




 Reddit use too be one of the few free speech zones that PC corporate culture didn't control. We need to give the new CEO hell for not respecting the wish of the vast majority of the users wishes.  We got rid of Chairman Pao, if the new CEO doesn't change fast I am going to start a petition asking for his removal.  
























 The only reason reddit cares about it "dark side" is because they want to make this website safe for future advertisers. Everything is not about money. Got that new CEO. 




 This is how ex-chairman Pao must currently feel like. 




 I hope the new CEO realizes  how important free speech is too most people on reddit. 




 Most TV sucks. 




 The guy from South Africa who is going to replace Jon Stewart is not funny.

 Before I came up with my mrsa treatment method, I was given vacomycin on three different mrsa outbreaks. The nurses had to move the IV too a different spot every day due the vacomincin inflaming my veins. 




 Vacomycin is a strong antibotics and is hard on your system. 














 Not sure. 



















 Old traditional media is dieing. People don't want to be told what to think.  




 The  gatekeepers of CNN are not happy with the fact that they can't control what is posted on reddit.  



















 Thank you for link.  









 Thank you.  














 Yep most likely. 




 Are you going to continue to censor popular posts? My successful post in r/technology was deleted and the moderator was rude and was trolling me. My successful post had over 600 points in r/technology and I was deleted and censored. I want my post reloaded and I want you to tell moderator ProtoDong to quite being a rude censoring gatekeeper.
