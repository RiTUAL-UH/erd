 She absolutely got a point! My doctor told me that eating healthy food will HURT me and I should avoid it at all cost. He also said that just by looking at healthy food pictures my condition will get worse. I literally can't look at pictures of food with less than 1000 calories. 

That's why I'm subscribed to /r/EatCheapAndHealthy and I send PM to every OP after each post. Those privileges got to stop. 




 It's possible, yes. It happens on acquisitions that are paid with stocks or in reverse splits. Your account might have a fraction of a stock. However, you can't sell a fraction in the market. Usually the broker will buy it from you (sometimes without even asking you) and credit your account.

 As a stock trader I can tell you one thing: You can't mix stock market opinions with political ideology. If you want to make money in the market, put your thoughts/beliefs/tribe aside during trading hours, and treat the market like a book to read from and your positions like a blank paper to write into. 

ZH never picked one of the two. So the results were 5 years trying to anticipate the next market crash that didn't happen. And when you are dead wrong for so long, you stop attracting reasonable people, and start pulling perma-bears and nut cases. Not because it's stupid to predict a crash (it's stupid to predict anything in the market), but because they predict using all the wrong reasons and sticking with it too long.

ZH best moments were when he/they put real inside information from the financial world. their downfall was that every inside story was accompanied by bad market crash predictions and ridiculous conclusions. 

So my stupid prediction is that when ZH  becomes completely  irrelevant or shuts down - that's when the bull market ends.

   people who say "I want X for every American" refuse to acknowledge that life in general is and will always be better for people with more money

That's true, but I think the X here implies some **minimal level** of education, healthcare, living income, water, infrastructure etc.

So they are not saying they want every American to have the same education, just that they want every American to have at least good education. If some can get more, good for them.  




 You are right about the separation, but would you vote for someone that says it's immoral to marry black people? Sure, he won't criminalize it, but he thinks it's wrong.  

Saying it's a "moral crisis" brings us back decades as far as understanding gay people. 

I personally don't think that it's a make or break for a president, but it's a sure one big minus. 

I also expect his position to turn if he wins the Republican nomination and moves to the national stage. There's no way he's going to stick with the moral argument on general election.  




  Unwanted growth inside you that causes you harm, steals your nutrients, and you want removed. You'd have the right to remove any person from being INSIDE YOUR BODY

 It costs lots of money because very few, if any at all, are issued each year. Almost all of the market is secondary (between old drivers to new) so prices go up. Taxi drivers are the first to object to issuing more medallions because they don't want more competition. 

In many cities there are few large taxi businesses which own all the licenses and they rent them to individual drivers. This way they maximize its usage (the license drives 24/7) and sees its value goes up due to lack of supply, which they fight hard to keep it that way. They are also in position to outbid any new player. Many banks will use the other medallions the business owns as a collateral for a loan for new medallion.

The second reason is interest rates. When interest rates are low, such as today, all yielding products, from bonds to real estates to medallions go up in price to adjust for lower return.

 From the book [AFFC, Ch6]: 

 Fear cuts deeper than swords, she told herself. Arya. She whispered the word the first time. The second time she threw it at him. I am Arya, of House Stark.

 You are, he said, but the House of Black and White is no place for Arya, of House Stark.

 Please, she said. I have no place to go.

 Do you fear death?

 She bit her lip. No.

 Let us see. The priest lowered his cowl. Beneath he had no face; only a yellowed skull with a few scraps of skin still clinging to the cheeks, and a white worm wriggling from one empty eye socket. Kiss me, child, he croaked, in a voice as dry and husky as a death rattle.

 Does he think to scare me? Arya kissed him where his nose should be and plucked the grave worm from his eye to eat it, but it melted like a shadow in her hand.
The yellow skull was melting too, and the kindliest old man that she had ever seen was smiling down at her. No one has ever tried to eat my worm before, he said. Are you hungry, child?

 Yes, she thought, but not for food

(tl;dr she was hungry, but not for food)

 It's also about a business making money. If you screen at home, you (usually) do it with good faith, for your entertainment.

 This is not exactly the piracy argument, because here we have a 3rd party that makes money using the HBO product/brand. I can't just sell GOT T-Shirts in my area with the excuse that HBO doesn't sell here anyway, so they aren't losing any money. 

Also, piracy arguments go against (or justify) the end consumers. In this case HBO didn't go after the viewers, but after the theater.

So yeah, someone might get right one show, but let that person decide on every show for few years, and he will probably drive the network to the ground.

 As someone who worked a lot with dogs, I must say that he got the main idea. However, it's almost impossible to implement in real life, especially if the dog is trained to arrack (like k9). A more reasonable approach would be to give up the hand, there's nothing you can really do to avoid it. Try to minimize the distance, don't hit or kick (they won't feel anything anyway), and if you are close enough try to fall on the do and position yourself behind his head. If you fell on the ground and the dog isn't beneath you (most chances for trained dogs), you lost.

 Hypocrisy will depend on her argument. If she claims the inequality problem/solution is $/hr wage cap, then yes.

 Yes. Well, they should. You expect from a waiter in this kind of restaurant to explain the dishes fluently and the way they are made, to match wines and other drinks (even if they have a sommelier), to bring your food exactly when it's ready, to serve just 2-3 tables at a time, etc. Now, if you think that's not worth the tip, then it's fine, you don't have to visit the restaurant. Lots of people don't think a steak for two should cost $225.

 Person of Interest. It's a broadcast series, so 20+ episodes/season, some of the episodes are case of the week type, but there's a long arc. The characters are developed steadily, the story gets more and more complicated, and some of the dialogs and one-liners are great. 

Also, I just posted in /r/PersonOfInterest how it's the most represented show in IMDB's top 50 highest rated episodes. 5 episodes made it to that list. It's a good show. 




 Person of Interest has 5 episodes on [the list](http://www.imdb.com/search/title?num_votes=1000, sort=user_rating,desc title_type=tv_episode) (tied with House MD). 4 of the 5 are top 16.

The episodes are:

 I don't know, I met some 4yo who acted twice their age, so... 8. And we all know that 8 is practically the new 28. I bet he thinks he should ask them how many partners they had, and only move forward if it's 3 or less. Okay, I made myself sick, time to stop. 




 I recommend [An Instance of the Fingerpost by Iain Pears](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15888.An_Instance_of_the_Fingerpost). An historical mystery set in 1665 Oxford, England. The story has 4 parts, each told by a different person. Some of the characters are based on real people/personalities.

 I once gave some change to a homeless guy and I got arrested because "it's not okay for someone to set up a bank and start giving out loans to the public with no license". 




 He pulled first on Raylan. If you go frame by frame, he moved his arm first (hard to tell because both are right handed, and the camera shoots from his left). But anyway, it was half a second after he said to Raylan he'd shoot him. So I guess that's... justified? 




 Out if curiosity I googled season 5 reviews, with 2 weeks time range before the premier. Top results that aren't fan sites: telegraph, frobes, independent, cnet and ew - can't say I'm surprised. Exactly where the current generation hangs out. io9 btw, reported from premier event in SF (probably 1-2 episodes?), which, again, makes much more sense than mass mailing shitty quality DVD. 




 While *Wonderful Tonight* is about his drug dealer getting OD and Clapton had to take him to the hospital in the middle of his wedding. 




 What good a review without spoliers would do a week before the show? To build hype, you send actors to late night shows, you show clips, you make trailers. What's the point of sendind a dvd with 4 (!) episodes to the most hyped show anyway?  




 1. Don't mail a DVD 2. Privately stream couple of hours before the show (like many do anyway today) 3. Review should be online when the show is done.  




 That's good. Those screeners belong to another era (newspapers and monthly/weekly magazines that needs be, what your father calls, "printed". It's got something to do with paper, so I've heard). Time to move on.
 









 I'm glad they didn't. Because the entire final scene was about how 2 of the 3 DID leave Harlan alive. Well, come to think about it, even Boyd is alive.

 Their coach was their superstar.  




 Another way of putting it is "Shaq had Kobe". God, the 2000-2002 Lakers were a real Force majeure. I'm glad I was there to watch them... even if I hated every moment of it. I suddenly remember all the frustration. Like you had start the 4th with at least 20 points lead or you wouldn't have a chance.  




 I lived and worked in NJ. Took me 2 years to come to my senses and move to Manhattan. Never looked back. Well, besides country bike rides and going to Costco. So I guess they have that going on for them. 




 Okay, I'm going to give a different answer here. Where I live, those kind of fences are used to keep motorcycles out of the way of bicycle paths, and you typically see them at the entrance of public parks. 

Anyway, whatever this meant for, it's not doing it.

 You have it easy. Try carrying this sack of gold all around. Ever since I won the lottery I got nothing but bad days to wake up to. 




 So them under 600, wonder if they worth the price.

Edit: thanks for the replies. I mostly hear positive things, so there's a good chance I'll get them. Seems like a good choice in that price range. 




 Not necessarily the largest and not necessarily bailout, but many do enjoy government's help. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying their existence is depended on this help or that it's a big part of their survival. I'm saying that it does exist.

Here are top 10% names (rank below 50) from F500 (not the S P):

* J.P. Morgan (#18) - all banks rely heavily on Fed short term loans. The target interest rate is basically a guaranteed loan to the business which they can take and leverage other loans to retails at higher rate. Most banks on the list have this privilege. Also, specifically on JPM, the fire sales of BS during the 2008 was a government deal (backing up BS bad debt).  
Citi (#26) was obviously totally saved.  
BoA (#21) received $50B TARP + $100B losses cover during 2009.

* Verizon (#16), AT T (#11) and other networking companies enjoy shielding regulations and limited competition. 

* Exxon Mobil (#2), Chevron (#3), Valero (#10) and other oil companies do enjoy some nice specifics [tax breaks](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/Oil_and_Gas_Breaks.JPG). Shell (#2 on the global F500 list) is also getting $1.5B tax break from Pennsylvania.

* Berkshire Hathaway (#4) - didn't take money directly, but some holdings did (GS (#74), BoA (#21), M T for example). You can probably add rail stimulus money to Burlington Northern.

* GE (#9) got government backup for $139 Billion of its debt. GE is also getting almost half a billion a year from different states.

* Boeing (#30) is getting $200M from South Carolina and another $100M from other states.

* GM (#7), Ford (#8) - $80B government help.

* Fannie Mae (#13) together with Freddie Mac (#32)  - huge bailout (takeover basically).
 




 The French director is Michel Gondry, who directed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and also won an Original Screenplay Oscar on that film. 

The documentary, *Is the Man Who is Tall Happy?*, is nice, but it's mostly about languages and how they emerge. It's more of a conversation than a documentary, so it gets heavy and repetitive (so does the animation). Worth a shot by all means, but it's not a brilliant film.   




 Yelling "fire" and free speech aren't related. One isn't an exception of the other. 




 wait, what? \*slowly stop raping and walk background* 




 Look, you are right by using 'demanding'. I never said someone wrongs you by not refunding.

 However, if I'm in a restaurant, the waiter asks me how's the food even after I'm done, and I say I didn't like it. It's a good and reasonable practice to suggest a replacement, offer desert or even not charge. Lots of restaurants will do that. Also, more importantly, lots of customers will not demand a full refund. I personally found myself in few situations where I didn't expect refund. Most people are reasonable. 

My point is: if you as a customer didn't enjoy your game, it's perfectly reasonable to ask for a refund. If you are a game developer, it's also reasonable to offer a refund.

The fact that you 'consumed' the experience got nothing to do with it.

 When I told Costco my printer didn't work afrer 3 damn years, they refunded me. And we all know the old printer is 'consumed' and probably going to the trash bin. It's a good and reasonable business policy. And gamers should know that. 




 Oil will probably won't dry up, it's the demand for oil will dry up.

If they are investing, good for them, but it means they'll be some rich Saudi families. Not a rich Saudi country. There's also a good chance that future generations will destroy this wealth, which is typically the case.
