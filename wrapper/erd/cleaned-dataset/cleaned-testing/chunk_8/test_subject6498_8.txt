 Vrlden kommer inte att hlla om det ska fungera s fr all evighet. Den kommer iallafall inte vara en vrld jag vill leva i om den fortstter i samma riktning.. Men misstrsta inte.
Alla generationer har kmpat mot ngot som verkat helt overvinnerligt. Om det s var kvinnlig rstrtt, rtten att lska vilken person man vill oavsett kn, svartas frihet eller frmgenhetsklyftan s har det alltid funnits folk som sttt upp fr det som varit rtt. Ofta mot alla odds. Med mngder av mnniskor som psttt att de aldrig kommer lyckas. Men de som sttt upp fr rttvisan har vunnit till slut. Efter att mnga har kmpat sig snder och samman har vrlden till slut blivit en bttre plats.

Att stta sig ner och tjura r inte rtt instllning. Inte heller att frga hur det ska gras. Problem r till fr att lsas. Och det kan vi inte gra p Reddit. Vi mste tala om detta med mnniskor. Det mste bli ett mne som ligger p folks tunga och vill gra sig hrt.

**Detta r min sikt** 




 r det inte dags att frska gra ngot t det istllet fr att ge upp? 
Jag r s jvla trtt p att g till ett val och rsta p en politiker jag gillar. Fr att sedan upptcka att det inte blir ngon skillnad ver huvud taget. Och om det blir det r den s marginell att den knappt syns om man tar hnsyn till konjunkturfrndringarna.

Frra ret gde de 1% rikaste i vrlden 47% av vrldens tillgngar. Nsta r kommer den siffran ha stigit till 50%. Det borde viftas med flaggor, men alla gr till sitt jobb 7-4 och ltsas som ingenting. 




 I'm sorry. And of course you didn't. I did not mean it personally. I recognize your username and you have posted some really good ones. But this one wasn't one of them :) I did not mean to offend you. 




 Grattis. Du r den frsta som frsker starta en diskussion istllet fr att plocka sakfrgor i min text och gnlla p dem. 

Nej, det r klart att det inte r ltt. D hade det ju redan realiserats.
Och jag vet om svrigheterna. Det r inte en slump att Kamprad satte upp en stiftelse och avskrev sig IKEA juridiskt redan 1982. Han vill behlla sin kosing. Det kan man frst. Till en viss grns. 

Det faktum att den hr diskussionen inte finns i Sverige ver huvudtaget, trots att vi kkar gubbens kttbullar varje mnad. Det r absurt. 

Om diskussionen fanns skulle man kunna gra ngot. Men den finns inte. Jag har inte hrt media prata om frmgenhetsklyftorna i Sverige och inte minst i andra delar av vrlden dr problemet r s fatalt att jag blir livrdd.. r detta vad mnniskan ska sluta som? En girig gubb/tantjvel som ska stapla sina pengar till mnen och tillbaka? 

[volymen av en frmgenhet i dollar](http://www.pagetutor.com/trillion/calculations.html) Vilket gr det lttare att frst hur mycket pengar det handlar om. Och kom ihg att vi snackar tiotals miljarder dollar hr fr de allra rikaste. 




 Och nu ser jag att du varit redditr i tv minuter innan du skrev detta. Allts....... Jag ger upp. 




 Allt. Alla. Eldas det upp p ngot stt utan att frst odlas av oss ska det beskattas (bokstavligt talat allts gynna dem som vljer att producera miljvnlig el samtidigt som miljfrstrande framstllning fr betala fr sin ovilja att frndras). Vi uppfann elden fr hundratusentals r sedan. Dags att ndra vanorna **nu** nr vi vet vad som r bra och inte bra.

[Om du tog och slog upp fakta](http://www.ekonomifakta.se/sv/Fakta/Energi/Energibalans-i-Sverige/Energitillforsel/) S skulle du veta att krnkraften inte str fr lika mycket som du tror (eller jag trodde fr den delen).

Det kanske inte kommer leda till srskilt mycket frre jobb att marginellt hja arbetsgivaravgiften. Men faktumet kvarstr fortfarande att regeringen valde att hva in den strsta delen av budgetunderskottet frn anstllande fretag. Istllet fr att ta frn de som har mer pengar n de, deras barn eller deras barnbarn ngonsin kan gra av med om de inte verkligen frsker bli av med dem.

Jag hoppas att det r siffrorna som frvirrar folk. Och att de har svrt att greppa hur mycket pengar en miljard, fr att inte tala om 10 miljarder kronor r att ha i fickan. 




 Jag brukar inte vara engagerad. Men efter att ftt upp gonen fr hur det ser ut i USA har jag insett att vi lider av samma symptom. Det r bara att vi redan hade gratis sjukvrd och fri utbildning, m.m.m nr det ekonomiska klimatet ndrades. De kan inte bara berva oss det vi r vana vid p en gng. D skulle vi ju kmpa emot.

Jag r fr hjd elskatt! P sdan el som *direkt* inte r bra fr naturen. Kol och Olja har en s galet mycket strre inverkan p naturen **nu** n vad krnkraften har. S varfr inte hja den som r vrst?


Jag r livrdd fr krnkraften. r man inte det r man inte frisk tror jag. Och jag vill inte ha ngra nya reaktorer, men att beskatta den istllet fr andra kllor som r vrre r i min mening helt jvla idiotiskt. Krnkraften r iallafall inte dlig fr oss nu. Kanske nsta vecka. Men kan vi inte se till att vi verlever imorgon frst? 




 Jag hller delvis med dig. Debatten mste tas upp, och budgetens *strsta* kning r markerad migration. Det r ett problem. Men snlla. Stirra dig inte blind p ["inandningen"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lcRQfzDXBs) som Robert Gustavsson hade sagt.

Det r ett **marginellt** problem, som anvnds som en ljuspekare fr en huskatt nr matte ska ta rkor och dricka vin.

**Snlla.** (Jag sger ordet och menar det) Kan vi inte ta invandringsfrgan i en annan trd?

Med det sagt ska jag agera hycklare. Och frklara varfr invandringen **egentligen** inte r ngot problem.

Vi skulle ha rd. Vi skulle ha rd med att lra upp ALLA invandrare. De skulle kunna f lra sig svenska och f fullgod sjukvrd. 
Vi skulle kunna hja lnerna fr lrarna. Vi vet att vra grundskole och gymnasieutbildningar r p vg ner i rnnstenen. Statistik ljuger inte. Vad sgs om att hja lnerna fr lrare, s att kvalificerade mnniskor knner att de inte kastar sina framtida pengar i sjn fr att utbilda sig till ett av de dlaste yrken som finns och istllet vljer att bli ekonom. (jag lser programmering, hade velat bli lrare)

Vi skulle ha rd med allt detta och lite till om vra nationalhjltar vi alltid hyllar, som startat IKEA, Hennes   Mauritz, Tetra Pak m.m m.m skulle komma ver sitt begr att behlla varenda krona (som de sklart har kmpat jvligt hrt fr. Iallafall de flesta av dem) och komma underfund med att en mnniska och hans eller hennes familj inte behver ha flera miljarder kronor att rra sig med. Man blir inte lyckligare av att ha s mycket pengar. Det r vetenskapligt bevisat (ett uttryck som vattnats ur och frlorat sin slagkraft. Men tnk p vad det betyder).

Vissa av dessa fretag har flera gare, med tskilliga miljarder (20-30) i frmgenhet vardera.
Mnga av dem str skrivna i London, p Bahamas och andra platser dr de p ett eller annat vis antingen slipper undan skatt eller behver betala vldigt mycket mindre n hr i Sverige.

Allt fr att ha 12 Miljarder kronor p kontot istllet fr 7 miljarder kronor.

(Kamprad har ver 500 miljarder kronor. Snart 2% av de dr 40 000 miljarderna alla skojar om. Hela jvla tiden)

 




 Du borde ta en titt p de senaste opinionsunderskningarna dr han kat med 20% de senaste tv mnaderna. 
Men jag antar att du ser p Fox News.
Chansen att han vinner primrvalet r sklart osannolikt. Men det skulle vara det bsta som hnt dem p vldigt lnge politiskt.. Antalet lagliga mutor politikerna i det landet tar emot r bortom all reson.

Jag tycker inte att det rcker. Inte fr de som har mer pengar n de kan gra av med. Jag kan frklara fr dig varfr. Men det mste jag gra efter jobbet fr det har jag inte tid med nu.

Grnsen r vl inte fr mig att bestmma. Men 5 miljarder borde vl rcka gott och vl till en familjs frmgenhet? Hur mycket mer pengar kan man tnkas utver 5 miljarder kronor? Kan f betala 2-5% mer i skatt? Eller det kanske skulle resultera i att ekonomin kollapsar igen.

Nej just det. Det var de som faktiskt gde ofantliga summor pengar som fick ekonomin att krascha. Det glmde jag. 




 I need someone else to enter this discussion. Troll or hopeless case? 




 De enda som svarar p en sn hr trd r sdana mnniskor som verkligen inte hller med. 

Den nya budgeten - jag vet inte om jag ska skratta eller grta. r detta vrt vlfrdssamhlle vi s ofta skryter om? 
De Rdgrna - Socialdemokraterna, Miljpartiet, och vnsterpartiet har presenterat en budget som gr mig rdd. Klarar du att lsa min text med ett ppet sinne beundrar jag dig fr jag brjar bli osker p min politiska stllning sjlv. Men om du eftert inte delar min sikt. Svara att du tycker jag har fel..

I budgeten finns mycket gott. Vi ska f bttre infrastruktur. Jrnvgen behver verkligen renoveras, och det verkar vara p gng. Dessutom tycks snabbtg mellan Oslo och Stockholm bli av. Vi fr fler utbildningsplatser, satsningar p vrden. Slopning av lxhjlpstillskottet som inte verkar ha hjlpt ett dugg och istllet satsning. kat underhllsstd. Allt som ska ske verkar jttebra.

Vart kommer finansieringen ifrn? Har man beskattat de miljardrer vi ftt fler av n ngonsin i Sverige de senaste ren? 
De som tillsammans ger 1 120 Miljarder kronor.

Nej. De behver inte betala hgre skatt. Den strsta delen av finansieringen kommer frn arbetsgivaravgiften fr unga. Som nu r tillbaka p samma niv som innan den snktes. De som kommer drabbas hrdast r allts de som har en liten omsttning och vill anstlla. Jobb kommer frsvinna
Krnkraften ska beskattas. Det r ocks en punkt. Jag r neutral till krnkraft, men man kan beskatta krnkraft fre kol och olja nr ens koalition har frgen grn i namnet gr mig frbi. Detta kommer drabba alla svenskar. Elpriserna kommer hjas. Och vilka kommer att f lida mest? Vanliga mnniskor sklart.

Jag r inte en politisk mnniska. Men jag r inte helt krd i huvudet. Ska budgeten godtas av alla som rstade rdgrnt? Ska det s kallade arbetarpartiet hja skatten p *arbetare* istllet fr att hja skatten p dem som bokstavligt talat skulle kunna bygga sin egen pengabinge?

I USA har en fr oss i Sverige helt oknd Senator och presidentkandidat ftt ett sdant genomslag nr han talar om frmgenhetsklyftorna att han p allvar hotar Hillary Clinton i opinionsunderskningarna. 
Och vi i Sverige mrker inte att vrt ekonomiska klimat lutar mer t USA n vrt eget Sverige nu fr tiden.

Och kom inte med att det blir Alliansen nsta val. De kommer inte gra ngonting bttre de heller. 

Jag vill hra folk sikter. Slpp vilket parti ni rstar p och frga er sjlva hur man kan hja avgifter och skatter p sdant som drabbar gemene man *istllet* fr att beskatta, **inte de rika.** Utan de snuskigt rika. 

Vad r skillnaden p 60 miljarder kronor och 50 miljarder kronor i en frmgenhet? 

Samtidigt r invandringen allt vi pratar om i politiken. r inte detta ett villospr vet jag inte vad som r det. 




 




 Yeah. Seems like good system to try to make it easier for politically engaged to try and balance the scales of your broken elections :)

I'm glad I know about it now. 




 I don't see why you shouldn't just donate directly to the Sanders man.
Isn't that "safer" and gives a largest percent to the man you want to have the money?

edit: I read up on the ActBlue. U're goooood. Seems like something I should've known about.  




 What is your profession and stuff? I could compare with what you would get payed if you were swedish. 




 Hell. Even illegal immigrants without papers are guaranteed healthcare in Sweden. I think you're good if you work and pay taxes my friend. 

I am realizing more and more how awesome my country is.. I rarely visit the doctor. 




  [Good. He is the one we all need.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpzgXVA8eh0) 




 You're completely right. It was a really bad outlash, but you have to realize. Although I have probably missed fights. This very, very rarely happens. And the fact that Nicki Pedersen is the one getting a (lame) punch is so not surprising it actually surprised me because why hasn't it happened earlier? About a hundred times. 




 What's in it for me? I'll get rich in the land of opportunity? 




 I haven't watched this booring sport since I was 14, but I grew up with Speedway once every two weeks. 

I knew, and everyone knew danish rider Nicki Pedersen didn't play a fair game. He does everything to win. He doesn't care if it takes a little bump into someone's front wheel when passing them. (sometimes he actually seem to aim for it) This happens more times because of Pedersen than anyone else in this sport. 

And yesterday one of the most respected people in the sport, American Greg Hancock gets enough of the dane's bullshit and loses his cool. Both of these riders are 20 year veterans. Legends that have both won Grand Prix several times.
 









 I came to write that. Easily the best speech I've seen. I shed a tear and I'm not even a little embarrassed to admit it.


I want to adress /u/Vermonty_Python 

: This last speech needs to be saved and cut into a new professional video. (that first bit should be cut out or be put last) And you need to inform Bernie that some version of the speech about the 80 billions the Koch brothers are worth. And how much THEY think is enough is repeated by Bernie. Often. He need to get into details more. Facts and details are gonna win him the election.
 




 ""If she's against this, we need her to speak out, right now. Right now," Sanders said. "I don't understand how any candidate, Democrat or Republican, is not speaking out on that issue."" 









 Now that's a real article.

The one from MotherJones is getting the most votes and it isn't bad either. Short and concise. 









 Well. You just got another follower, so I hope it's gonna even out.. I won't comment anymore because I think Bernie's stance on negative attacks are spot on and not needed. Also, I imagine the circlejerk (which I participate in) here is even worse than in /r/SandersForPresident. But I will gladly upvote a post if the link is a serious source with a good point, because the fact that america might have another Clinton vs Bush is fucking terrifying. :) 




 Hey, get a flair :)
I'm sad there isn't one for Sweden.  




 Did this politician basically shush people cheering to get his political policy heard? 

I want people to find a video of another politician doing that....

edit: Honestly. Just when I thought I had heard everything this man had to say, thinking he is the politician with most integrity I've ever seen. Bernie surprises me again..

And as a non american I have to say. America's culture of constant cheering at speeches is really weird.  




 Of course not. But this is a so called "what if situation". 
edit: If you're an american you should be very familiar with what ifs. Since you're a socialist in a not so socialist country. 
I can say, honestly I voted red in my country. So don't you deflect shit. Answer my question instead of acting like a teenager. 




 I know it got something to do with beer. 

lol. Understood some. Are you basically saying ActBlue is not very good because it gives most of the money to Bernie but keeps a little to pay for their own personal shit?
I'm asking because I refuse to cheat. 




 I just want to add. Thank you for learning a Swedish fellow maybe the best saying I've ever heard. In any language really. 




 Jag hr dig broder. 




 I hope you're right. But I think you overestimate how many people actually click on the articles concerning politics.. 




 And if (on the slight (slight) chance) that Sanders would win the primary nomination? Just vote for someone else but him or a republican? 




 This is awesome. I totally agree. A big win for Bernie. But this article is so biased it shouldn't reach the front page by any means because the journalism of this dude is unprofessional and emotional. And that puts this whole sub in the wrong light. There are other posts on the same subject. Upvote them and downvote this. 




 I'll be a little surprised if you want. But I'm not.... 




 Hey guys! I'm from what we jokingly call "The Welfare State". And I got news from Sweden that might help in getting a grip of what extended social benefits might mean for the economy and how to formulate the benefits of a stronger social welfare program. I believe there's some ammunition here to counter disclaims on Bernie.

**What the budget raises support for:**

support for single parents

More employees in elderly care

6 500 new spots for higher education

Infrastructure

Local climate investment Support

Scientific Research 

Commercial Stimulation




What I link to below is a PDF file (text) from the government  that reviews income inequality in Sweden, the proposed budget's points that adress it and what the expected results from the changes in the budget are (page 24).

http://www.government.se/globalassets/regeringen/dokument/finansdepartementet/tema-statens-budget/varbudget-2015/vap-bilaga-2-fordelningspolitisk-redogorelse.pdf


Use google translate's function where you can translate a PDF to read it in english. It looks awful, but the translation is good. Not perfect but good.

The raises in welfare programs are for now mostly payed for by slightly higher tax on nuclear energy (which provides almost 50% of the energy) But higher tax on fossil fuels and on capital gains are proposed and will enter into force in 2016.


**Swedish guys** If this is interesting for the sub. We could translate this document in 30 minutes each. Probably less.



Also the fact that the budget passed makes me proud to be a Swede. The opposing block forfeited regarding the budget to let the sitting "house" pass the vote.

 




 I'm not an American but a Swede so I'm not really that into your politics. O'Malley sounded good on an info site, but when I look at his voting history he has vetoed a LOT of good legislations that I skimmed. Considering my recent history in this thread that might not mean much. But for example [this one](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.296:) That forces drug manufacturer to inform the Secretary (whover that is. But I guess Secretary of Health or something?) when there is about to be a shortage of one of their drugs for MORE manufactoring reasons than discontinuing the said drug.


Did I misread this too, or is that a realllllllllly good legislation O'Malley vetoed? It would give sick people more time to find a substitute drug? But I guess it would hurt companies profits.....

Living in Sweden, enjoying "free" healthcare and education payed for by the country together I think you guys could use some Bernie Sanders. But I heard 'Murica is a free country. Of course you should vote for a politician representing your beliefs. Whoever that may be.
 




 Phu. I think you focused a bit to much on the first line of my sentence, but yeah.. If one person don't get my point for whatever reason that's all the reason I need to rephrase.
Sarcasm really do come across really bad in writing... 




 Nice one. Who do you plan on voting for in 2016? Or haven't you made up your mind yet? Or are you from China?  




 Yeah I saw it. Fuck.

Yeah. Reek's chapters are a joy to read. So.... How about Stannis huh?.. D D basically spoiled that one too in a "behind the scenes".. 




 EDIT: **Noticed it**. Oh boy. did I have to eat that one up with a side of shame and some shame on top. I'm not deleting this comment because I'm not that ashamed. Even though I should be.

Oh boy. you didn't read the article, but just read the top comments?
The article clearly states that [Clinton's Financial Disclosure] (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/16/us/politics/document-hillary-clintons-financial-disclosure-form.html?_r=0) (You can read the stuff yourself and see.) shows she and her family made 11 million dollars from speeches that are not accounted for in the "Clinton Foundation".

I expected someone who watched Game of Thrones to be a little clever at least. Considering Tyrion is your favourite character (lucky guess?) :)

 




 I love you autowikibot. If you were a real person you would be... Well. You would probably be Bernie Sanders because you really do know what's best for ME. And you do what you say you do. And you do it so damn well. I honestly had no intention of clicking that link :( And I feel really ashamed.  

Reading that made me realize there are a lot of people out there who think the same. They just don't know who to vote for. 




 Hillary actually lied? "I'll be a little shocked if you want. But I'm not." 




 I'm never leaving. Not even if Russia gets a little to (un)friendly.

On topic: What your're speaking is truetrue. I think this is the stuff Bernie will advocate a lot when he gets more attention. He apparently changed Vermont a lot for the better. (According to himself of course, but I don't think he would win by such a long stretch and for such a long time if he didn't deliver.) Maybe some Vermonteeers should get together and make a video about what Vermontians think about Bernie and why. 




 I changed my phrasing. Better? 




 I truly salut you. You and your brothers and sisters may well be the people who save the world if this thing takes hold (exaggerating for effect. [Or am I?](http://www.cnbc.com/id/102759742) It's not just the US...). I'm from Sweden though and I thought America was doomed. I'm not really about to uproot my life anytime soon and move over there. Especially since I already have free healthcare and an education I am enjoying very much. 

I feel like I'm part of this by spreading the word here. And in related posts on reddit. Even though it's bloody hard. People are so stuck in their mindsets it's scary.

I'm thinking of getting engaged in the board of my condo. Don't know what it's called in english. But if they don't get enough people engaged it will turn into a rental. And that would just add to the inequality. So at least that's something..... 




 I'm just quoting those who mindlessly agree on something. If they really do think it is bullshit why not explain why they think that way?
If I'm mission your point. Please do elaborate. I would like to understand you.
And sorry if my english is bad. It's my second language.
 




 People just downvote what they don't agree on. I'm trying to start a conversation about how the rich are making more and more money while the group of people with less money are getting less and less. Do you not think that is a good discussion to have?

I'm not by any means poor, or come from a poor family. It's just my honest opinion.
If people don't agree with my opinion they should write why. Not press the down arrow. 




 I'll be a little shocked if you want. But I'm not. 

"It's literary fame"

longest EDIT in history: We really need to make this a thing. Joe is genuinely surprised. she is trying to make it look like he's just up because New Hampshire is close to Vermont. Sure, it's partially true, But I'm fairly sure New Hampshire is pretty on to the politicians being a what'sitcalled.


It's gonna be the best steal of a quote when Bernie wins this whole thing. (Trust me, I'm slamming the wood with both my fists for those who believe that sort'a thing)

Also. You must pull your hair for making a typ-o in the headline on this one. But I get it. You're as excited as I am. 




 If yo somehow try to rationalize the increase in inequality. My guess is you watched too much news. 

Because most news channels gets a fat paycheck from the ones making the big buck. (yes, duh, and how this was allowed to be spoken on the largest station in the world is basically a miracle) 

I'm telling it straight to the ones who are stubborn (usually a good trait, so don't dispair)

**It's never too late to come to your senses.**

edit: Starting with bad phrasing, read more in the discussion. Also, my own bias. Also. Do you downvote this you are just a mindless drone, a bot or a [re-he-he-aaaly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2MPoqqzwdY) stubborn person. Because the proof is literary in front of your eyes. 




 It really is "funny" because it's true.


[And Oppenheimer would have said it again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb13ynu3Iac)

Scary how well it fits this scenario. 




 That makes to much sense. I think this may be why I slur sometimes as well. Do I think faster than people or do I just not slow down my speech enough? ;) 









 I'm with you. Either there's right wing douches who downvote everything with a different opinion or there's something shady going on.  




 Of course they are. Comcast owns NBC. I don't think Comcast favors Bernie in the White House. 




 As a Swede who didn't know this I must say.. I'm a bit proud...  




 R you serious?  




 For people on the spectrum. Sarcasm. That's how politics work in 'murica. Land of the Free, Home of the Brave.  




 Yeah it's one of those rare cases where it's not about the ratings. 
Are there any truly neutral, large media stations in the US? NBC is owned by Comcast if I'm not mistaken. 




 I mostly agree.

The whole baby drama... And Caputo's journey from a social hero story that were really engaging, but ends up basically saying: "fuck worker unions, go for the top yourself and screw everyone else".. **I don't get it.** Is that the message they want to tell american workers?

I have gotten som hysterical laughs this season though. Probably more than the previous two. 




 They still use fahrenheit? That's probably what caused the end of the world. 




 Jeb Bush's not the only presidential candidate who has a lot to explain. 




 Not at all.. And now even The Pope has acknowledged the dangers of the ongoing climate change.

Many republicans are slower than the church. For christ sake..

But hey. Instead of starting a discussion on this important topic, the top rated comment is a joke on a fucking name?

Reddit has truly sunk to a new low.

 Imagine an economically strained person not needing to save money for college or pay health insurance. This is the reality for people in countries who enjoy "free" public university and universal healthcare. Their personal wealth would get a huge boost due to this.

 The thing about text is that sarcasm doesn't come across all that well. You should try to speak plainly.  




 No need to apologize. I find that most people on Reddit/The Internet in general get really heated in discussions. Which there is no need for.

In my opinion a competely socialist state is not something to strive for. But socialism has a lot of aspects that are really good for both the economy and for the workers in that economy. And that is something I think USA could benefit from. 




 What? Me? Don't cry wolf. I'm just expressing my opinions just like everyone else here. Just because I don't agree with you doesn't mean i'm not a real person with my own opinions.. (Trying really hard not to be rude)

EDIT: I just realized maybe you don't know what a shill is. 




 No need to be passive aggressive. Maybe my point wasn't clear. I mean there should be a healthy amount of competition between production companies so as to encourage innovation and low prices.

The problem with absolute socialism is that it doesn't work. There needs to be some kind of a free market, but it should be more regulated than it is today in America so as to ensure that the workers aren't abused.
 




 And meanwhile the politicans making those decisions. Introducing the bills and legislations have gotten millions in donations from corporation to fund their political campaigns. What do you think was said between the donors and the recievers?
"I give you this, if you do that" 




 It's not about economic growth (which btw is a term used in propaganda). 

It's about that 99% of all new money in USA goes to the 1% that is already the richest.

My question is: How much more do the richest need before it is enough? 




 I'm a Swede, we've been ruled by democratic socialists for the better part of the last 100 years and that is not how we or any other sensible country I know do it. To me your suggestion sounds really dumb. Nothing personal against you. 




 Take a closer look at the politican in question and you just might change your mind. 




 That's just genius. Sadly even shoving it in peoples face isn't going to make them change their minds...  




 YOU! You go to the top. And you stay there. You hear me?

Also. Your name is the definition of appropriate. 




 Completely agree!
