 Just use it to store a finger tip vibrator and you don't even need a condom....   




 I know i was pretty surprised.  I use like 14 kilowatts a day to run a few lights, computer, refrigerator and aircon if its super hot.   

Still though... I wonder when someone says "I burned 500 calories in my workout" if those are calories or "food calories".  Because there is a difference   1 "**food** calorie" is actually 1000 "calories" 




 This whole pluto thing is really lifted my spirits about the human race.  

The world sucks right now.  And life is shitty for lots of people.   But we still strike out and *explore*.

When I was a kid... I used to wish and hope that the human race would be like that on Star Trek.  Where we are driven to constantly learn about new worlds and see new places.   And to do it better and better each time we try.  

Or when an Empire probe landed on Star Wars and began its survey.   We fucking did that shit on mars dude.  Hopefully without the eventual crushing of windpipes and giant laser spitting walkers... but we fucking did that.    

And I bet it looked so fucking cool; when the rover was dropped down from wires.  Like Sylvester Stallone, on Demolition Man, when he dropped onto the roof from the chopper. All badass and shit... with his muscles.   That's exactly what it looked like when NASA dropped that rover on Mars.  

[Just look at that rover.. with its bulging wheels and large equipment.](http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2012/08/06/pia14839-85abdf262805d57e9b097ab6a943f312108f9870-s900-c85.jpg)  Mmmmm ::licks lips:: 

And we fucking do that, dude!   Fuck yeah man.  Lets go to space some more! Keep that dude with a mohawk employed!  Maybe my grand-kids will be hopping all over the solar system.   And their kids to a nearby star.   Or perhaps into the quantum world.  To look smaller and smaller inside matter.  There's an infinite universe inside of everything.  Its fucking awesome.   

I'll be dead and won't get to see all of it.  But I'm proud of humanity's "Explorer" status.  We can achieve so much that we are assholes if we don't try.

 Because, you don't walk around looking like a moron in motorcycle boots at your job.    




 I agree.  Better gear than without.  

But here's the difference for me at this point: 

Someone taps you on a bike and you fall in front of a truck.... this happens.  

Someone taps you just as hard in your car, you pull into a parking lot and bitch to the cop about how inconvenient this all really is and how you could have been killed.  And their insurance better pay to buff that out!    




 If you notice, it turned his helmet into a nifty scoop.   That way you can get the little tiny bits the jacket left behind.   




 I put my bike up for sale yesterday and sold it this morning; after riding for 15 years.   

I'll miss it.   But I've been looking at pictures like these for the last 3 or 4 days and I don't regret my decision to not ride anymore.   Not in the least.

edit. whatever it needed a fix.

 I've been saying this since day 1:  Donald trump is a trojan horse.  He brings the batshit crazy out of republicans and makes them look bad.

They don't really work that well.   Washington has those.   




 I'm sorry... its about getting stuff that is in ubuntu software center to work on ubuntu.... So I just assumed ubuntu is the place to ask since my problem is when I am running ubuntu and not opensuse or any other flavor.   




 But it does... cause I'm running ubuntu.  And none of the dictionary in the software center work well.    




 Because no one goes to vote.  The root of that problem is the fact that election day is not a non-working holiday.  It should be.

 Yeah... it doesn't trickle down.  It just gets handed off to the financial sector.   




 You'd have a ton of supporters not vote because of apathy.  Which benefits the republicans.    




 "Its about Bernie" the Headline says....  


No it isn't.  and he's the first person that will say that it isn't. 

This is about the bullshit that is the way our country is right now.   Time to change it for the modern world.  People that are behind him are behind his *ideas*...  

 




 If you are referring to the inability to mass produce it [that changed this year.](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a14651/this-scientist-invented-a-simply-way-to-mass-produce-graphene/)   




 The only problem with Hydro, is that it still has a tremendous effect on the surrounding environment.   

Washington State, for example, is hydro.   Their salmon are disappearing because they cannot return to their spawning areas.   As such the bears are suffering, and on down the smaller scavengers that eat the leftover salmon the bear caught.    Like Bald Eagles, foxes... like that.   No foxes also means rodent populations rise... 

So there is a whole network of things that get changed by hydro.  


I mean don't get me wrong, I'd prefer hydro over coal... but hydro is the last of the "clean energy" solutions I'd pick.    


There are plenty of alternative solutions: like building long air pipelines between regions of different atmospheric pressures.     Tidal power,  Non-rotating blade wind farms...   It just needs to become cheaper than fossil fuels.   

Solar and hydro I'd pick last.  Probably even behind Nuclear.  Panel and battery production for solar make it not so clean.   


TBH, new designs for nuclear make it the best and safest option we have.   Unfortunately, even if we started now, it'd be 25 years before a newly designed nuclear power plant went online.

 I was told in a credit repair class that it's more desirable to leave a little bit of balance rather than pay it off entirely.   

It shows you're profitable to them.   
 




 I used to work nights.  It'd be funny how many people would frown on my finding a bar at 7 am or attempting to buy beer.   

They would say "it's not even noon yet"  


"Bitch, I work nights... its just past dinner time for me.  Mind your own business, cock."    




 I'm a Logistical Engineer.   I don't have an engineering degree... but thats the title they gave me.   

Sounds fucking cool.   All it means is that i set up logistical systems for others to use.   Like... park your trucks here.  Have your central station radio here.  Drive truck there.  Now come back and park.   

All seemingly simple concepts to me, but I tell you it's like rocket science voodoo magic to some.   I just have to remind myself that there's simple shit I don't understand either.  Like grammar... wtf is a comma?   




 I'm okay.  I have a lot of responsibilities.  And I can get enjoyment from anywhere.  I'll find something to replace riding.   

Like eating pizza and playing video games.  That's a good hobby right?   /s 




 Yeah.  I'm 35 now anyway.  I have a ton more responsibilities.  

I am happy nothing serious happened to me up to this point.  Probably because every time I left my driveway I wondered, "Is today the day I die?"   

So I never rode like a dick.   I knew I could hit 220 mph on my bike like I see these other dudes do.   

I knew wearing shorts, a T-Shirt, and flip flops meant with the low weight I might reach 225 before running out of road.    

All those dudes laughed at me and called me a pussy when I rode with all my gear on.  Laughed at my defensive riding.   How I treated each car like I was invisible and they were a retard.  

Those guys are the ones I see in the pictures here and read about in the newspaper.   

I love to ride.  It's the most amazing thing in the world.   

Guess I should get rich, buy a shitload of land, and put my own roads on it.    




 Doesn't help to have a small fragment lodged in my nerve.   Removing it could mean paralyzing the rest of my hand.... so I just have to deal.  


Wanna catch me in a very bad mood?  Add lightning to the mix.   
Its like a little electric shock, inside my hand, with each flash.   

No doubt atmospheric pressure alters the compression of my tissues, if however slight, and moves that fragment.   My fuck....   

And no medicine helps.   Weed can put me to sleep... but I have  to get really fucking high to get any benefit.   So the only time I can use that as a treatment, is when I am not going out in public.   

The low THC weed doesn't do shit.    




 I have neuropathy that accompanies phantom limb pain.   There is a small piece of metal that remains in the remaining portion of my hand.   

Low pressure systems are a bitch.   Incredibly painful.   

I am living on an island.  I thought my hand condition was getting worse... turns out there is an explanation.   Thanks.    




 Keeping a couple of employees there 24 hours a day is cheaper than a monitored security system.  Which is WAY more expensive for a business than a home.

Or if someone talks about teeth squeaking across each other.....   




 Well... I mean... yes wear a helmet.  But just google image seach "motorcycle injury" and you can see how many were wearing helmets when they died.  

So.... helmet or no helmet you're dead.    

I am selling my bike today.  I've been riding for 15 years... but it's not worth it.  I love to ride.  Fucking LOVE to ride.   

But the life cost.   IDK.  It's huge when that bill comes due.

 This is why I'm selling my motorcycle.   

You can be the best rider in the world and it's no match against the dumbest idiot driver in the world.  

I love riding.  Its amazing.   

But its just not worth it.    




 You seem to think the president just sits around doing only his salary paid job.  

Obama's salary [only accounts for 46% of his yearly income.](http://blog.blackbusiness.org/2015/04/how-much-money-does-president-obama-make-income.html)  The majority of his income comes from books.  

Also, the speaking fees go way up for a president.   [Bill Clinton made over 100 million dollars from it.](http://blog.blackbusiness.org/2015/04/how-much-money-does-president-obama-make-income.html)  

And then there is the business interests whilst in office.   [Cheney's Halliburton Made $39.5 Billion on govt. contracts,](http://readersupportednews.org/news-section2/308-12/16561-focus-cheneys-halliburton-made-395-billion-on-iraq-war) during his time in office. Cheney was just a V.P. and his financial interests blossomed while in office.   

So.... not really sure why you think money is not a motivator for Hillary (or anyone) to become president.   It's HUGELY profitable.    




 Unless the creek is like the ones in washington.... In which case the creek just might snake its way all over the place and eventually lead you to an unpopulated inner valley.

 Their tech support is incredibly responsive.  Just email them.  A lot of times they let you have their next release early.    




 They renamed it about the time when lollipop came out and blue mail had additional features added.    




 Its not dodgy in the least.  I challenge you to find any other mail app that is packed with as many features and stable.     Blue mail is type mail.  it is same app just new name.

 Turn off talkback to remove a ton of recent apps tab lag.    




 [Why?  Right now TW performs about the same as stock but with tons of added features.](http://www.phonearena.com/news/TouchWiz-speed-test-Does-Samsungs-interface-really-lag_id66407)     




 LG is where it's at if Samsung removes SD from note 5.   

Also try to turn off talkback from your applications manager.   

Then go into developer menu and reduce your window animation and transition scale settings to .5 or 0.  

Install nova launcher (you still get to keep TW multiwindow and Spen feature if you do this) 

If you're not on a unlocked device, install a deodex rom w/xposed so you can get rid of the screen off memory leak.   If you're locked.... sorry.  Don't buy any more locked phones that you cannot fix yourself.    

 




 Probably because I told people to pay their debt before taking on more.  That's unamerican!    




 That study is very old.  The 70s was a radically different time than today.  So I'd be interested to see a more up to date study on this.  

Sadly, I don't think one has been done.  Our politicians are content to continue keeping this debate one that is based off emotion rather than actual logic or science.   Gotta keep that divisive non-issue available so that republicans and democrats actually have something they differ on.     




 If you admit you regret having kids you get vilified.  It doesn't matter if you're doing a great job as a parent.... if you regret, you're a monster.    




 The difference is that the device is locked so you cannot fix the issues on your own.   Also, when the unlocked community has had 3 or 4 updates to radios and firmware while the carrier locked phone is still stuck on a single old update, you have a TON of difference how the hardware performs.  

Fucking idiots buying carrier locked models even if it means they don't REALLY own their phone.   

Even once the phone is paid and your contract is done you cannot use it anywhere else or change the software how you want.  

STOP BUYING CARRIER LOCKED PHONES.  They are MORE expensive in the long run.    




 I have both the Exynos and the Snapdragon versions.  

Snapdragon nets me about 45 min extra battery life in a day.  But it's terrible lag.  
Exynos is very very smooth and snappy.  The snapdragon feels so laggy and slow.   

But honestly it could be many things.  

1. some people need to turn off talkback still.  
2. reducing the transition and animated settings to .5 or 0 in developer menu
3. installing xposed to removed the stupid screen off memory leak of 5.0.1.
4. Stop buying carrier locked phones if you cannot do step 3.    




 XDA forums are really the best place for learning how to do this stuff.  

Just don't ask a question that has already been asked.  They will eat you alive for that shit. (never mind their forum search is just an idiot keyword return).    Just throw xda into your search terms whilst using google, for better results.    




 Then there's the crowd that swears they did a factory reset but really didn't and just want to scream about how samsung sucks.  

I admit, samsung should have told everyone to fuck off about getting 5.0.1 and just gone straight to 5.2.   But they didn't... and wasted their time.  

Now we are going to get 5.1.1 when we should be getting 5.2 as 5.1.1 only really solves a memory leak that is already solved by non carrier locked devices being able to run xposed on deodex lollipop roms.   

 




 People need to quit buying the locked down carrier model phone.   After they've already made back the money from the subsidy (which occurs before you buy the device) they continue to make money off it.  

Then, you don't REALLY own it as you can't root it, change the software how you want, or switch to a different carrier.   

AND you get locked into a 2 year agreement, unless you're an idiot and paid full price for a carrier locked device.   

STOP DOING THAT PEOPLE!  

Many vendors offer financing on the unlocked non carrier devices.  Hell even buy now pay later with paypal.  

Or just put it on a credit card and pay it off in 4 months like I do.   

If you count not being able to move to other carriers with your device, and what you spend being gripped into 2 year contracts; you spend way more for a subsidized carrier phone than you do if you buy the full priced item.   And you STILL DON'T OWN your device.   

If you cannot afford the full price phone, or your credit is jacked up so that you cannot get financing, then you shouldn't be buying a premium phone and instead spend that money on paying your debts.   

Verizon gets away with this shit because morons keep spending their money locked devices.    




 Add president to that and you've got an even bigger resume.    




 Presidents get more huge speaking fees.  
I mean... if a lot was enough for anyone in this country, we would not  have the problems we do with all our wealth being so unevenly distributed.  

The office of the president is hugely profitable.   WTF are you talking about? you're only counting their salary whilst in office.   




 Wear a T-shirt with a political leader or commentator on it... preferably someone very controversial, like Jan Brewer, Rush Limbaugh, or Elizabeth Warren.  

You will be excused from the selection process very early on.   

You can also buy those "real look" fake lip rings and nose rings.   Get yourself all studded up and looking like a gothic raver from 2001.    

Neither the prosecution or defence want to people that think for themselves or already have preconceived and rigid notions.

 What?   At least under the current system we have some accountability.  We know that Hillary is a stooge and that Bernie has been reliable his entire career.   

Just throwing random idiots into office is not the solution to our current problem; which largely stems from the majority of people not voting in every election.  

Election day not being a non-working holiday is the root of that problem.

We've already seen the travesty of what idiots on a jury are capable of.  And you want to apply that to ~~government~~ elected office.  And make everyone a lame duck as soon as they arrive in office, as well.  

Your idea of how we should build a government is the equivalent of throwing a handful of darts at a dartboard whilst blindfolded.   

 




 I'm currently doing humanitarian work in Southern Leyte Philippines.  

Most of Tacloban STILL looks like a nuclear bomb hit it.   A pacific super typhoon will wipe not just cities, but an entire country off the map.   

And it's no joke when I say it looks like a nuclear bomb hit it.   In 20 years, Yolanda strength storms will be a dime a dozen.  20 years ago these were 5 year storms.   Now they are forming every year and in multiples.  

I can't imagine what it will be like in 20 years.  Every 1 or 2 months a yolanda comes.  

And no matter what month of the year, a typhoon can hit.   Every month is typhoon season in the Philippines.  So there is no reprieve.
