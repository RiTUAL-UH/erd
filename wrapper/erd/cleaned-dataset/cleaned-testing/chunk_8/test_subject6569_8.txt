 Holy. Shit. 

...

Anderson wins the 2nd set as well. 




 Cheers! 




 Ain't 'allegedly' just the best word? 




 I was gonna ask that question but when I scrolled through the replies to I saw that you and the other person who asked this didn't get an answer but were downvoted instead, which is a kind of answer I guess... 




 That thought has crossed my mind as well.

From what I could see Victoria was very good at her job and she seems a genuinely lovely person.

Yet I'd be lying if I said that there isn't an evil part of my brain that would like to see all the backtracking that would happen if it got out she was let go over, say, sexually harrassing a male co-worker. Imagine *that* drama! 




 I thought about it for a second but then laughed it off. Darn! 




 He's 30 already, but, then, he was able to keep up that insane pace for the entire match, so who knows? 




 Yeah! It was pretty cute how he just rambled on and on at first. He was so excited (as well he should be!) 




 I gotta say though I can see why OP would make that mistake. Seeing him up close in the BBC post interview he looked about 22 to me.  




 After that insane start Rafa seemed to get a nice handle on Brown's game in the second set and I turned to my friends and said, shaking my head: "Well, it was fun for a second but now Rafa's figured him out. He'll destroy him in 4 without much sweat."

I humbly retract my statement. Never have I been so glad to be wrong. What a game! 




 Loved the grin on Federer's face after the play. 




  But the foundational flaws in Sanders candidacy are pretty easy to spot. Sanders may be polling well in mostly white New Hampshire, but he hasnt been able to figure out how to earn more than 5 percent of the nonwhite vote, according to [national](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/06/01/2016.poll.pdf) [polls](http://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/02/National-Politics/Polling/question_15726.xml?uuid=jTWRTAkVEeWVHo4VCQ1krg).

This is distressing and important. Sanders is the ideal candidate for a large chunk of minority voters. His political stance is more supportive of those on the lowest rung of the socioeconomic ladder (where many minorities are represented over-proportionally) than any other candidates. Especially hispanic and black voters, a large percentage of whom work blue-collar jobs (56.1% and 47.1% respectively, versus 36.8% of white workers^^[source](http://www.asanet.org/images/research/docs/pdf/RaceEthnicity_LaborMarket.pdf) ) Sanders should be able to get a large chunk of that vote, but right now his support in those communities is dismal.

This brings me to a problem I see in this subreddit. Here the prevailing reaction to low support from minorities here seems to be one of frustration: Those voters should just be able to see how great Sanders would be for them, right? 

Of course, some of them will. With increased visibility, Sanders' numbers will increase in those demographics, but I doubt it will be a drastic change. For a drastic change, there must be drastic measures of outreach campaigning in the minority voter's communities. Because that's how politics work. People would rather vote for a visible/graspable candidate whose politics align imperfectly with their own than an unknown quantity who seems to be saying all the right things.

Let's not forget that this subreddit is a huge echo chamber. It's mostly white, male, 18-25 year olds (well, it's reddit after all...) who have been hearing/reading/talking about Sanders for months now. Outside of this demographic, Bernie's still largely an unknown quantity. Mass rallies and media attention are slowly changing that fact, but without a *herculean targeted effort* of outreach towards minority voters, Bernie will be nothing but another crusty old white man to them when the primaries come.

Why? I think one of the reasons is because those with the lowest socio-economic standing have the most cause to be cynical about politics. They're being courted in the election cycle, but as soon as the people they're voting for are in office, most of the promises give to them are then broken. You can't win a democratic nomination without the poor, but implementing the policies you promised them (e.g. get them through congress) is frustratingly hard. Poor people are being fucked every which way, it's easy to understand the cynicism and apathy towards the electoral process.

What's to do about it? I don't have a quick-fix answer for that. All I can say is that the campaign hasn't yet focussed on the minority vote enough, and it's high time they start. Get Sander's message to black and hispanic neighbourhoods, to whatever group holds sway with minority voters, and do it quickly. Otherwise Hillary's gonna kick his ass up and down the states in the primaries. Because in you cannot win the democratic nomination without the minority vote.

The good news is that Sander's message already appeals to the minority vote. Unlike other candidates, he does not have to to alter his message to cater to their interests, but he has to get it out there!
