 Where did you find them? I can recall seeing a collection of tickets in the trash near Chicago and Austin a few years ago. 




 In all fairness, bronchitis can be a rather time consuming illness that a number of people simply don't have time to deal with. 




 Also, that's just a REAL heads up pass from Johnny Toews, out there, couple-a happy humans out there, Pat. 




  Jersey and underwear ONLY, then. No excuses! 




 Same here. Knox and Mike Brown's injuries were especially heartbreaking because those guys played with such emotion and intensity.  




 Well, [here's Johnny Knox's last time on an NFL field.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnGgBba0K_A) As unlucky a football injury as I've ever seen.  




 That's actually [Mitt Romney on vacation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney_dog_incident) 




 Thank God they finally changed Isis's name! 




 6 months ago we were celebrating [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd8GlFx2acw) After catching 3 TDs to come from behind and beat SF, who would have ever thought he'd be shipped out of town for virtually NOBODY!?!? I'm not even sure I'm a Bears fan right now.  




 I'm not sure Ms. Frizzle got enough permission slips to do this field trip.  




 I think that Yelp claims that businesses cannot pay to remove negative reviews. I did write a scathing review of Group Fox Properties a few months back, and it disappeared twice. I had to copy and paste it a few times to get it back up on the page. 




 Judging from the graphic on the back "Eurocar: moving your way" is probably the German version of U-Haul. The person driving it probably has zero experience driving trucks.  




 They were believed to be associated with gangs. 




 At the Lutheran school I went to my friend got sent home for wearing [this shirt depicting Homer in his underwear.](http://www.peaydesigns.com/images/Clothing%20-%20Tshirt%20-%20The%20Simpsons%20-%20Homer%20-%20Livin%20La%20Vida%20Sofa1.jpg) My science teacher said he wanted to send a strong message that we were not to wear clothing depicting images of people in underwear.

Then I went to a public high school were the following apparel/colors were banned: 
Baby Blue and Black, Yellow and Black, the color Pink, NY Yankees gear, Georgetown University gear, the number 22, and any random Mexican kids that security wanted to stop in the hallways. 

The punishment was going to the Dean's office and changing into these giant Pepsi t-shirts. I'm constantly baffled as to why neither school just made us get uniforms. 




 It's expensive. 




 Eager and Burish are still in town playing for the Wolves.  




 YES! Sullivan needs to be way higher on this list!

[Legendary moment with Sullivan:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qye101BNhWE) 
People seem to forget that he scored two short-handed goals after getting hit with the puck. 

Also, I remember him having an epic game on St. Patty's day one night. His trade to Nashville was so infuriating; scores a hat-trick in his first game as a Pred and puts up 10 pts in 3 games. 

 




 She saw Rob Halford with a Marilyn Monroe wig on.  




 Thanks, Dr. Oz. 




 [WHOOOOOOOO!](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/23/cd/ae/23cdae3120859307b839e01fc9a3bf17.jpg) 




 The patience and selflessness of Hossa... 




 ..."for the biggest buncha beauties in the league"... 




 That's Denis Potvin commenting!?!? Since when does he advocate calling penalties for mundane shit. 




 Playing poker with Pirri. 




 Ha. Listening to the Panthers announcers who are commenting that they "deserve" a powerplay right now. 

EDIT: Boyes to the box. Even more hilarious.  




 How did I forget? Guess the Rodman vs. Claude Lemieux fight clouded my memory. 




 "Hey, remember that time when I saved that kid's life."
-  u/mesum  




 Yeah, man. Who could forget that night that when Jordan had the flu, and he went out and got five points against the Avs, including the game winning assist on a Tony Amonte goal.  




 Ha! I loved how she was constantly flirting with Tim McGill, it was uncomfortably hilarious.  




 He should call [Carl](http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/fd/99/2c/fd992cb5c1ca0b652611fb776d076b61.jpg) to help him improve the van's image a bit. 




 That an extremely rare signature edition Cougar. Design experts from 3M and Reynolds Wrap were consulted, and just 8 of these were put into production. 




 The floral pattern here, is clearly too loud. The vest? That's aspirational. Now, many centuries of great men have taught us that blue shirts just make sense. It evokes a feeling dating back to the days of the indigo trade....  




 2 minute penalty to Sharpie for being too handsome. 




 Cory "Don't Toews me, bro" Schneider.  




 I've seen enough highlights of him writhing and flailing about since the Shaw incident. STAY ON YOUR FEET, MIKEY! 




 Actually this is Super Walmart. Dead Zebra is $2.99 per pound at the deli. 




 They opened a Walmart in Whoville? This isn't going to bode well for local business owners. 




 Looks like someone spent the extra ten bucks to double the berries for his SWEETHAHHHHHT! 




 THANKS FOR SUCKING THE LIFE OUT OF MY WEEKEND, NIEMI!
 




 This week, as in today? The picture of Barrett punching Pierzynski would make the visit worth my time.  




 He was right about that last storm. The fact that he says that "the temperature will turn brutal" after the storm is the most upsetting thing. 




 Nobody asked for your input! 




 Tell me about it! [Stanhope was digging it too!](https://twitter.com/dougstanhope/status/523957593879105536)  




 "Disney IMTRO?" Why did she let Bill write the title of her video?  




 It's proper place is when you've decided that instead of Burger King's Crispy Tacos you're going to splurge and treat yourself like the royalty that you are.  




 At least they admitted that their pizza sucks.

 Response sent. Four years experience as a lamppost here, and did my internship as a tree. 




 Geez. Bossy is 58 and he looks like Clint Eastwood; being an Islanders fan the last few decades has been tough on him. 




 Make sure you drink Mountain Dew everyday so that you can play in the NBA! [Reminds me of this bit of advice by Donovan McNabb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWcdzzwqAzc) 




 I scream that for no reason. 




 No kidding. I just can't bring myself to hate Shark, hope he has a great individual season at least.  




 ...but it's had it's moment. 

[r/chicago went ape when someone regurgitated this joke on the Northside of Chicago](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/2r87tk/real_fuckin_classy_gios_bar_grill/) 




 Right. Austin is also more expensive than Lincoln Square, and from this map I've also learned that Uptown doesn't exist.  




 [r/chicagopickupsoccer](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicagopickupsoccer/) was active over the summer, but has since gone into hibernation. We met up at Wrightwood Park for small-sided games. Your best bet is to message some of the guys in the original thread to see if they would want to restart the group. I'd be up for playing... in March. 




 There is a place on Montrose near Ashland called 20th century that specializes in this type of repair. If you happen to check it out let me know how it goes. It's a really curious place because I always see a guy that looks like Jerry Springer working into all hours of the night. The last time I walked by he was monkeying around with a VCR at 1am. 




 I took a picture of cab #666 like 2 years ago, and it was a Nissan Altima. Guess the reaper has fallen on hard times, that car is a downgrade. 




 Ha I saw that sign that said "2HR 18MIN to JANE BYRNE" on the Edens. That's when it's time to just roll the dice with city streets.  




 Me too. While on a smaller scale, I was just pissed that this happened right under my nose:

Recently, I ran into the Edgewater Jewel early one morning and had a guy remark to me how cold it was. (He's parked next to me, so I happen to notice that he has the same make and model car; only his looks crappier) I thought it unusual that he needed to walk around my car to get to his, but wasn't suspicious. As I come out of the Jewel, lo and behold, I had a few center caps that just happened to be missing.   




 Indeed. Ah, yes, ol' chap. Here's to a smashing ice hockey match. Cheers! 




 I refuse to upvote you until this comment has a plastic lawn-chair. 




 Yes! I got there slightly before 10, and was able to wait inside. Yes, they do dismiss all 3,000 people through 4 doors on State street; so the front entrance is a little squished. However, it is worth getting there early so you don't freeze your ass off. Hannibal Buress went on at about 10:35 and did an awesome opening set.
