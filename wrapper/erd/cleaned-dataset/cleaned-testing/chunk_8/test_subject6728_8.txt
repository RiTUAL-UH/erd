 i've heard of special astral gates that let meat go into astral and corps hid their existence and protected them heavily outside and inside.

i've seen some stuff from 4th age about magic it isn't that far from sixth with few obvious examples otherwise pretty much of it sounds like things peopel just haven't thought about it or have the materials and critters available

blood magic is especially brutal most things leave you disfigured and such. 




 If it's knowledge dragons supposedly might also be able to do it, right? Assuming it isn't a "secret technique" of the 4th age 




 I'm talking like Great dragon magic, mass blood rituals, VERY powerful spirits and ETC at what point could a spirit start showing signs of higher magicks (probability manipulation or true resurrection ) things that most certainly would not be possible for a pc in normal play.

please no "handwave it" type of responses, it's just for speculations and debates sake.

here's a good one too what would your "Perfect" scenario for a ritual and i mean bringing everything you know ,ley lines,feng shui etc. 




 Yeah it's just that feeling you get when see someone's elses thought on how he looked. 




 I don't wanna explain too much bcause it might go against lore and have it all go down the drain.

On the other hand it's a metaplane

yeah i'l just introduce some more people maybe some animals that were also caught in the blast and they'le meet while climbing the tower

"I haven't seen the tower light up in a long time" could the spirit say.

how do we get out?

"if you want to technobabble talk to the one who's in charge of it" 




 Woah is that really how he's depicted? 




 Nobilis you are lord and embodiment of an aspect of reality. 




 well the point of the of a manastorm hitting the veil is to cause a big magic event, it's supposed to be magic but you can always drop hints for it to be something more

Only one way to know,climb the tower.

i had the free spirit idea but then i thought "they're nowhere why would they? but i'l let some metaplane "citizens" there to drop some hints and chat.

it's a deep metaplane , who knows if deep enough they are or sometimes are the same thing?

In the end i hope th gm left enough hints for the players to make up their own explanation usually that is way more interesting then what you had planned.

but anyway thanks for the suggestions! 




 Okay i summon a spirit how do i know what the spirit can do?

basicly walk me through spirits in Mage: The Ascension 




 Please read the whole conversation.
