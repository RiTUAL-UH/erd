 [The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3268458/?ref_=nv_sr_1) is a pretty moving documentary about this awesome dude's life and fight for making internet a better place. 




 great point. 




 This line is from Stephen King's *Carrie*. Isn't it? 




 A very good point indeed. 




 This hurts. 




 I strongly believe that in some specific instances, such as this one, we confuse *striving* with *suffering.* They both differ strongly if we look deep enough. 




 The source is [his speech at a commencement ceremony at Princeton University](http://gulfnews.com/leisure/movies/news/christopher-nolan-explains-inception-s-ending-1.1531119#.VXauYqRi5Qc.reddit) 




 What do you think of such a thing? 









 The best part about the trailer is that it opens with the closing lines of the book. That is some way to launch a trailer of this film. 




 That was fuckin kick-ass awesomeness! 




   like someone never moved by a work of fiction. 

Oh how unlucky that would be! 




 I always read the name of this author twice so as not to mistake it for Franz Kafka. 




 Thank you so much for pointing out.. Just bought his *The Global Warming Reader: A Century of Writing About Climate Change*  




 Thanks for the encouragement.  




 Sounds pretty straight forward. Will do. Thanks. 




 That's a great advice. Thanks. 




 I'm an aspiring novelist. But sometimes I just can't overlook the beauty of language that is presented in freeverse poetic pieces. I recently read Mary Oliver's *House of Light* and rejoiced a great deal of wordly beauty that those pages presented. And Tagore's *Gitanjali* is my all time favourite.

I too write some freeverse now and then, and also I was told by a few friendds of mine that I write short poetic stuff better than I write the regular blogs.

And also on Tumblr I sometimes witness beautiful stuff written by random people around the world. A recent one that I found and became a fan of is Jamie Oliveira. Her [cosmicroots](http://cosmicroots.tumblr.com) blog was splendid. Some of her works were simply sour stirring for me.

Experiencing all this beauty of language and words in shortly woven pieces, these days I'm tending to try out freeverse writing myself. 

What do you think are some of the ways in which I can improve my freeverse writing? 




 Undoubtedly, Kindle Paperwhite. 









 That's good too..  




 Thanks for the response.. 




 What are the best books on the subjects of Global Warming and Environmental Protection? 




 Thank you so much...  




 Recently I found out that I'm developing a concern for the wellness of our planet, its greenery, and above all, for the threat that we're impending upon our home in the form of heat and Global Warming.

What are some of the best books that you've read on this subject?
 









 and credited it to who? 




 very cool. 









 Movies and books...  




 Being God. 




 From a recent news I came to know that over [1100 people died](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/25/asia/india-heatwave-deaths/) in my country (India) due to the summer heat. Most of them poor people.

This made me wonder what would be the case of the future generations in the years to come. 

Now, I want to know of all the ways (even the smallest) on how to help the planet. 




 Just received my copy of *Leaves of Grass.* 









 Inception and Interstellar vary only by a slight fractional difference in terms of my favouriteness. 




  he story itself relies on hints and implications that the reader has to pick up by themselves.

TIL that I just suck at it :( 




  Potassium cyanide gives off a faint but distinctive "bitter almond" smell/taste,

Oh now readers need to know chemistry, huh! Dahl dude.. That's not why I pick up your books - for getting lost on the point in the story that involves chemistry. 




 What the hell :O
Why.. why would Roald Dahl, a person who wrote *Matilda*, would come up with something like that. :'( 




 The recent one *The Martian* by Andy Weir is a pretty awesome sci-fi book. 




  I used to be the obnoxious girl who would correct everyone's grammar and spelling. When reading aloud in classes, it made me crazy when people couldn't pronounce words.

That's Hermione right there :) 




  just practice.

I like that trick..  




 Yeah, Math when properly understood can be real fun.. I want to see that fun. 




 I've a point to try it :) 




 hey thanks for reminding about this. 




 Math is something we all need in our daily lives. It is only obvious for everyone to be wanting to become good at it. What are the ways that helped you pick up Math in easy and interesting manner? 




 That's like a Potterhead.. Kudos to both! 




 I picked up his short stories collection volume 1. Just finished the first story *The Landlady* and it ended abruptly when Weaver was trying to remember somthing about the two names listed in the guest book of the hotel. And why did landlady tried to interrupt him when he was trying to remember how he found those two names familiar??

I'm an aspiring author, so it is important for me to understand what I'm reading in depth. 

What was Roald Dahl trying to say in the story?
 




 That was beautiful. 




 *Paradise Lost* is a free verse?? I didn't know that.. But yeah I agree that it has some of breathtaking lines ever written in English language. 




 I added *Leaves of Grass (Enriched Classics) Mass Market Paperback  Special Edition, 1 Aug 2006* into my cart. Is that a fine one or should I go for someother? 

EDIT: Sorry had to remove the Amazon link. I mentioned the edition. 




  Leaves of grass deserves a mention since Whitman is considered the father of free verse.

Oh what a beautiful concidence.. I just added *Leaves of Grass* to my amazon cart a while ago :) 




 *The Alchemist* is a great life changing book in my life.. Everytime someone asks me to suggest them a good book, this is what I tell them about. 




 Just now I finished Mary Oliver's poetry (free verse) book, *House of Light*. It was a very pleasing read. It has some great touching lines:

*"There are many stories, more beautiful than answers."*

*"She does not work slowly, nor quickly, like a river."*

*"Its not size but surge that tells us when were in touch with something real."*

*"If the world were only pain and logic, who would want it?"*

*"Fear has not yet occurred to them, nor ambition."*

and my most favourite:

*"This is not a poem about a dream, though it could be.*

*This is a poem about the world that is ours, or could be."*


and many many more...

Now, I'm thinking of picking of Shelley's poetry soon. I just broswed a book or two of his and they appeared to be very promising free verses.

What are your favourite free verse poetry books?? 









 Last year, I picked up *Flatland* by Edwin A. Abott. I was thrilled by the mind-bendingly written lifestyle of the 2D geometrical figures. I absolutely loved the genius creativity that was put into that book.

What are some of your favourite books that are an epitome of creative genius in writing? 




 I always felt that Voldemort was a good collector of stuff. 




 B.E.A.Utiful! 




 actaully it's a great relief to hear that. 




 From her poem [*Little Owl Who Lives in the Orchard*](http://www.poetryconnection.net/poets/Mary_Oliver/17296) 




 I like gifting books. A friend of mine is quitting his job to start his own entrepreneurial venture. He likes astronomy. Yesterday, I presented him *Cosmos* by Carl Sagan as a parting gift. 




  I think many of the people recommending them as life-changing are folks who aren't heavy readers or previously thought of reading as dull and are simply surprised and excited to find books that move at a quick pace and include a lot of action and twists. 

You just killed me man. 




  His fight meant nothing. Human life. 

I'm more of an optimistic person.. Human life doesn't necessarily mean sadness and dissatisfaction.. Well, human life is better than fishing. That much I can say. 




 I second you! 




 1984. 




 Oh how surrealistic! 




 I once read a selection of paragraphs by Paulo Coelho. Among them there was a selection from *Lady Chatterley's Lover.* I absolutely loved the description.. it was very feelable. I recently bought the book to read it completely.

What are your favourite books with sexual descriptions? And among them are there any books that deal with *sex* in a spiritual perspective? 




 Thank you so very much sir :) :) 




 By the way, can you please tell me the name of that essays collection by Chuck Palahniuk??? I searched but didn't find. 




 One face with different shades everyday. 




 Harry Potter. Those 7 books are at the core of my heart and the way my morality in life is shaped. What else is so important for a person than his morale! Albus Dumbledore has taught me to always be humble no matter how powerful you become, and Harry taught me it is good to stay down to earth even if you're the most important person to many. Hagrid had taught me trust. The trio themselves had taught me the value of friendship... And above all, the Harry Potter series by J.K.Rowling has showed me that life can be magical and illuminating if one only remember to turn on the light. I'm indebted forever to Rowling. 




 I will look into them for sure. In fact, an article by Chuck had once immensely helped me understand the *show, don't tell* rule of writers.. So, I'm sure more material from him would definitely be helpful. 




 Oh no apologies, pal.. Welcome to Reddit.. It's one of the awesomest places on the internet.. You might wanna check out /r/destructivereaders and many other subs that deal with lots of interesting things... Front Page is awesome place to find some great stuff.. There is a sub for almost everything you can think of.. almost.  Explore and enjoy... 




 Hey thank you so much for the response :) :) 




  The thing I enjoy writing the most is dialogue

Looks like you love to write in dialogue.. Please teach us some tips here.. no seriously.. helps people like me who suffer to write dialogue.. 

I'm not native to English so most of my dialogues sound pretentious.. How to deal with that?? 
(Any suggestions from anybody would be pretty helpful. Thanks.) 




 Hey pal.. you gotta post this in the text box.. not in the comments section, so that it accompanies your post. 




  would like advice on what to do with this.

Write another one.

 My friend said to find a website that I can post on and create a sort of portfolio on, but I don't know if that is a good idea.

That is. 




 "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others." -George Orwell, Animal Farm 









 Oh my god.. this is one of the best quotes I've ever read in my entire life..  




 That's the question on which this entire sub is founded in the first place. Find the answer by yourself if you're interested, buddy. 




 Hey buddy.. looks like you need a bit of /r/allcapsmotivation
CHECK THAT OUT AND FUCKING KICK THE ASS OUT OF YOUR GODDAMN LIFE. 




 Yes.. Agree.. Sometimes when I observe that I'm putting too much time in computer than into reading I just shut down all of it for a couple of days and just read... It's so satisfying feeling. 




 Thank you so much for pointing out.. If you fortunately find such links please try taking a minute out and commenting them here in this post if you can. Thanks. 




 Hey, thanks.. This kind of comments is exactly what I made this post for. 




  There are theories like the many worlds/multiverse theory where consciousness can sort of "jump" from one timeline to another causing memory discrepancies (or the "Mandela Effect"), but thats really just a fun guess.

I believe in all that shit.. It helps me cope up with this world's reality knowing that somewhere out there is another universe where I am achieving everything that I wanted to. So soothing! 




 No.. I'm asking to point out the interesting phenomenons that are discussed here in this sub, phenomenons like *the Mandela Effect.* That is all I'm asking. 




 I've recently seen a post here that talked of Mandela Effect. Till that moment I've never heard of such an effect. When I learned about it, I felt thrilled and amazed at the same time. I'm an aspiring writer and now I want to know about these Glitch-causers. So, I request you all to please post in the comments some of the 'effects' (like Mandela Effect) that are discussed frequently in this sub.

Thank you :)
 




 Something tells me I need to save this post. 




 Harry Potter series. 




 Thanks for the idea... :) 




 Mark Wattney's sense of humour is the best thing about the book. 




 Wow.. This one is very good.. Fits well with my lines.. Thank you so much :) 
I would love to see your work on the other samples in there as well, in case if you try them too. Thanks, again.

**EDIT:** I've shown this artwork to some of my friends and they really liked it very much. And also the more I look at it the more I feel amazed. Thank you so much for the splendid work. 




 THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE.. AND BROTHER, YOUR COMMENT SHOULD'VE BEEN IN CAPS.. BECAUSE THIS IS GODDAMN [/R/ALLCAPSMOTIVATION](http://www.reddit.com/r/allcapsmotivation/) 









 Just saw the drawing session post... really looking forward for responses.. Thank you so much once again. 




 I don't do anything. I just sit and listen to the book. I listen to audiobooks mostly when I feel like finishing more books in less time. Becaue I don't read fast.. so audiobooks are really a way for me to 'read more' in less time.. And also, when it comes to Malcolm Gladwell's books, I only listen to his audiobooks.. I like his narrating voice so much that I don't get the similar kick when I read his books by myself. 




 The light that comes out of screen when everywhere around you is pitchblack might actually harm your eyes and lead to headache. I use Kindle Paperwhite where I can regulate the light emission.. and ofcourse kindles are designed particularly for reading, so they've actually considered all of that eye sight thing.. If you're talking about reading on tablets and mobiles I would suggest to keep the light at the minimum so as not to affect your eyes. That is all. 




 Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, and Words from the Myths by Isaac Asimov, and Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer, and Walden by Henry David Thoreau 




 This is a good idea.. we also need something like /r/artbuddy for writing.. Is there one? 




 It sounds like a great idea.. thank you so much for the support...

EDIT: Here is the link to the [Freeverse sample pieces.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9Y8K-TwazumKmKGdVEVGI3VGE82tpu_hHLvnvVa334/edit?usp=sharing) 




 Please try drawing this:

*Peacock looked at the Angel dressed in heavenly white, and danced. Its heart was filled of bliss. It wished to be born as an angel in its next life.*

*Angel looked at the bird dancing beside her with its beautiful feathers open, and wondered how it feels to be a peacock.* 




 yeah.. our generation has only techno stuff.. but the older ones had world wars to cope with. 




 Yes. This sub is maintaining the collection. [It's an official megathread on the page.](http://www.reddit.com/r/interstellar/comments/31c587/collectors_edition_imax_cell_megathread_post_them/) 




 None. Because nothing is going to be close to it. Atleast not in a few years to come. 




 Interstellar posters with that bookshelf are always intriguing.. I love it. Personally as a lover of books I feel it a tribute by Chris Nolan the way he used that bookshelf in the plot. 




   i also wondered what in the world people were always doing that was driving him nuts; no cell phones, no tv, no computers, no automobiles.

Oh I never thought of that.. And so I could relate to it in the present day life... You raised an interesting point. 
 




 *Stranger* by Albert Camus. The most illogical book I've ever read in my life.. I mean, what kind of normal person kills somebody without even knowing why he is doing it?? 




 * The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho
* Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer 
* Walden by Henry David Thoreau
* Angels and Demons by Dan Brown
* Gitanjali by Rabindranath Tagore
* Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell
* Flipside by Adam J. Jackson
* Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton
* Words From the Myths by Isaac Asimov

and

* HARRY POTTER series by J.K.Rowling 




  Into The Wild

It's a life defining book for me as well... along with *Walden* by Henry David Thoreau
 




  The Old Man and the Sea.

I thanked god when the book was finished.. Seriously, what a godforsaken boring book it is! 




 Hey can you please share the names of those three books?? 




 Franz Kafka's *Meta-fucking-Morphosis.* I mean, seriously, what *is* that book??? 




 YEAH. NO DOUBT IT IS. WHEN I READ IT FOR THE FIRST TIME, I COULD THINK OF NOTHING FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS OTHER THAN THEIR NERVE WRENCHING COMMITMENT LEVELS. IT SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME WHEN I IMAGINED MYSELF IN THEIR SHOES. THOSE MONKS ARE ONE OF THE BEST ASS-KICKING AVENGERS I'VE EVER HEARD OF IN MY LIFE. 




  I loved Animal Farm.

Animal Farm is my actual favourite classic. 




 Yeah.. reading and music sometimes go together like [dick and pussy!](#s) 




 Yeah seriously.. That 'book inside a book' thing... it was literally the most dragging part of the entire thing.

At the beginning of the novel when the concepts such as *Thought Police* were being narrated, it was really interesting. And 1984 being a famous sci-fi novel (which it is goddamn definitely not), I was expecting something of a Hollywood level plot twist.. and then facepalm :/ 




  Couldn't finish it. It was so dry and flavorless. 

 I mean, no offense. It's popular for a reason. I just couldn't stand it. I feel like dystopian is just too overplayed now and I've seen it all before.

High five! 




 It took a while for mymind to register what I was looking at, but when I did.. *Oh Boy! It was spectacularly designed.* 




  In two days, I read three books! 

I'd love to accomplish such a thing.

 I cleaned my room, and it looks amazing. Just like my soul.

Dude that's a nailing sentence.

 Could this all be a placebo?

No. It's will power, brother.
 




 Maybe I didn't like the book because I tend to dislike dystopian novels...  The ideas in them are good than their execution IMO. 




 1984 (I know I'm gonna be downvoted for this comment. But truth be told.. I felt glad when the book ended and I could finally put it aside.) 




 THANK YOU, BROTHER.
