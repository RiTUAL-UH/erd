 I'd say you're wrong.

 Male - sex woman - gender  




 Thank you! Back at you! 




 Your second analogy is actually great. Questioning can feel a lot like not knowing who you are and being wrong about it. That's why, when a person finally comes to a real conclusion, it's better safe than sorry. They won't be offended by you trying to hard to accept them, but may be hurt by you seemingly not trying have enough. 




 You're putting words in my mouth. That's not even close to what I said. She earned the medals while presenting as a man and being male. I don't know the rules for trans* Olympians, since I'm not the least bit interested in the Olympics. In my opinion, people should participate with the gender they present and/or identify as, regardless of sex, and if that changes in the future that has no bearing on the accomplishments, but I don't make the rules. 

Since you are clearly looking for a fight, please go TERF elsewhere. 




 That's so cool! I'm sorry all you got was a gator. Maybe you can try again in the future! 




 Incidentally, one can be male and a woman. 




 I have anxiety and just throw it on whenever I'm having an attack. Its soothing  




 I think she would have gotten less outrage if it weren't for her crimes. She was literally only known for violating the Espionage Act and nothing else. 




 Yep! She has always been a woman, just not out about such. That's the rule of thumb, anyhow. Individuals may have personal preferences but it's a fair, safe rule to follow. 




 You're the one being abusive here, hon. 




 And that is a struggle for a spouse of a transperson. But guess what? Transitioning is about the individual, not their spouse or us strangers. 




 True, but I've learned that six is waaaaaaay too many. 




 I'm 20. My current favorite is Hairspray. 




 Manatee! When I was in kindergarten my class "adopted" one and fundraised for it. 




 On my wife's 21st I had two glasses of wine and five pina coladas. I was smashed. She was still mostly sober so at midnight we made a Wawa run and I ended up throwing it all up. 




 It's okay! Thank you! 









 Yes! I was on mobile with next to no speed and Google wouldn't load the real name for it! 




 Shawn is unisex? That sounds about as unisex as Britni to me. 




 I, too, am an ordained Dudist Priest! 




 I basically use my face routine on my arms twice daily. I start with Equate-equivalent of Cetaphil cleanser. Then, I use Equate Black Head Eraser. Then I use wipes with salicylic acid that I purchased at the Dollar Tree. Finally, I moisturize with Equate-equivalent of Cetaphil moisturizer. In four days the redness has reduced significantly as has the bumpyness. I hope someone else can use this to help them! 




 I'm confused; what part are you sorry to hear? 




 Then don't go so slow in the left lane. 




 Thank you! We are very happy with our choice! 




 If your parents made you aware enough that you attended pride events, you have to decide to become a bigot. 




 Thank you! 




 In typical babydyke fashion, we talked about marriage from about 2 weeks in. It was always an inevitable. There was never a huge proposal in a super immediate way. On our nerd anniversary dating I gave her a ring in Texas Road house and asked her to marry me at some point. However, setting a date was done by us sitting in a college sociology class and me realizing that her father's income took her out of financial aid. I wrote her a note explaining such and we talked to my parents (who we live with) and got their okay. We talked to her mom the next day.  




 I drive a 2003 Hyundai Elantra that I paid for with my own money from an accident suit in my 1997 Volvo 850 that I paid for with my own money. My brother drives a 1998 Ford Mustang that my uncle hooked him up with cheap and helped with all the repairs.

My brother is constantly calling my car a go kart and just a general dick about how much better he is than me. It really hurts me and I really hate it. He is completely irrational and talking to him about t would do nothing.

TL;DR my brother is a dick. 




 Hahaha I sniff her armpits, too! I also pick at her pimples and stuff. She hates it lol but I love it.

We work really hard to support each other, and so far it seems to be working okay. 




 We are both gross and don't have fantastic hygiene; mostly it's a side effect of our depression.

She eats ranch dressing on peanut butter sandwiches. I find it horrifying. She is grossed out by my insistence on licking her face whenever possible. 




 We have been together since we were 15 and 16. That helped for most of our family members, and, she would have had to drop out of school because of financial aid, so her mom got over it really fast. 




 ...come to think of it, you probably have. 




 Cheap vibrators use AA or AAA. Good vibrators use either D or C batteries.  




 /u/MeridatheBearida is my wife and we would love to a answer any and all of your questions! Happy pride month! 




 Then let's stay fat! 




 You are a balterina! 




 I don't know if you mean it that way, but this seemed really misandrist to me. 




 And they can still attend pride rallies and church. Like 75% of Reddit went to church before becoming atheist. You can go to a pride parade and then decide to become a bigot, too. 




 I identify as gq and don't have PCOS. My wife has PCOS and is solidly a woman. I don't know that I believe there is a link. It seems as though he is implying that heightened testosterone levels make someone's gender identity wacky. It would stand to reason that going on T would alter identity as well. 




 Walls is my go to when I'm feeling down. Such a good song. 




 "Tell me how you feel over and done with
Like your life is a map with no compass to guide,
At the bar drinkin way too much
We sing along to "Forever Young"." - Somewhere in Neverland

"Little rats, running mazes, having babies
It's a vicious little world" - The Reckless and the Brave

Those are my current top two but it fluctuates. 




 When you're in a position of underprivilege it's important to see more perspectives so you don't develop a victim complex. 




 So any actor making a racist joke must be a racist. Any actor who makes a joke about dead babies/abortion/stillbirth/miscarriage must be insensitive to women and loss of children. Any actor who makes a sexist joke is actually sexist. 

That's completely preposterous. Acting is not real.  




 I'm proud of you for making it through last night. That's a major accomplishment. I hope that you can continue to make it through every night until it's no longer a struggle.  




 Eh, it's called acting for a reason. That's like saying that agreeing to play a murderer means the actor perpetuates murder. 




 Oh! I see what you mean now; circlejerk upvotes of the same thing so the hive mind can get going. That is definitely really shitty and not something we want. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. 




 [I posted this on offmychest yesterday about this very topic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/37wwzn/its_my_body_hair_and_ill_do_what_i_want_with_it/) 




 That's still good content. Clearly people like it if it's being upvoted. Why does it even matter if the posts aren't true? It matters if the content is enjoyable to those consuming it. 




 Sadly, the issue seems to be time and energy for OP, not money, but perhaps I'm wrong. 




 No, no! See it's a *health issue*. /s 




 As a mobile user, please no. 




 Yo. If you think all females the same and all Js different, you gotta straighten out some priorities. 




 I make my wife shove everything in her wallet. 

Check mate, femmes.

Seriously though she hates it and makes me carry said over stuffed wallet. 




 I'm here for laughs. Other people's karma doesn't affect me; if they have high karma clearly they post good content. 




 And that's fine for them. Some of my trans friends truly identify as trans and like the label.  




 Well that's a trans pride symbol. Clearly your friend doesn't have trans pride and prefers to be seen as equal to a cis woman. That isn't a bad thing, but based on that this has little to do with her then. 




 Well creating them is sort of gross and shouldn't be shown to children, but growing them is fine! 




 The placenta looks like a Mary Poppins umbrella situation. 




 You da real MVP, OP. 




 I am a 20 year old woman. I last shaved my legs the night before my wedding, which was December 10th. I last saved my armpits roughly one month ago. I last shaved my pubic hair sometime in January, I think. 

I'm a small part Native American, and it presents in low body hair and reddish toned skin. My legs don't really appear hairy, as what there is is blonde and thin. My armpits have enough growth to feel the breeze from the fan if I'm shirtless. 

I absolutely love it. I feel sexy with more body hair. I feel more myself, not working so hard to remove what is naturally growing. I bathe regularly and wear deodorant, so smell isn't an issue. Not shaving makes me feel at home in my body. 

My wife loves that I'm more confident. She loves that I like my body more. She also knows that, if she asks, I will remove all of it for her. 

I wear shorts and don't care, though I don't quite have the confidence for tanks right now. 

My sisters in law are all 14 and 15. They are all super feminine and don't get why I'm comfortable this way. I don't need them to get it. I need me to be happy, and this helps me be happy. 




 36 of my deceased '89 Volvo 740. 




 You know what else was the best thing to happen to LGBT people? Stonewall! Sure, we we're murdered an assaulted but people knew!

Just like with AIDS! Formerly Gay Cancer, formerly GRID. We died and were treated unjustly and that bigotry prevails but people knew gays were real! 




 I disagree that the email and Skype are an issue. If you ever thought the companies didn't have records you're incredibly naive. I never really considered the medical stuff, but if it's attached through email, It's almost to be expected. 

I was unaware of the picture and phone sex stuff being circulated, but that's an issue of abuse of the system, not the system itself.

Thank you for making me more aware. :) 




 Except when you use the internet it's a public thing, not your bedroom.  




 I'd skip the pap and just get a massage. 









 My wife's engagement ring was 60 bucks and her wedding ring was under 30. We are happy and in love and the money spent on a ring is irrelevant.

 You can't sit with us! 




 That's why I always dry myself on the floor. I don't want the floor to miss out on perianal sweat. 




 I think that would make getting raped a little worse, like you're laying there having just been raped which is really a shitty thing, and then you smell ice cream but there is none to be had, so you're just that much more upset that you can't even get some comfort food. 




 It seems like I went through webMD and picked symptoms. 

I have irrational, uncontrollable anger that I can't handle well in many situations. I'm very emotionally unstable; I can go from ecstatic to livid like the flip of a switch, and I handle neither particularly well. I have really bad abandonment issues for no apparent reason and it manifests in my testing relationships and generally being an asshole to make sure people don't abandon me. I nearly always feel empty; the only time I don't is during extremely special happy events and when I drink. I make a conscious effort to control my drinking and drink less than once a month, and I'm a lightweight so literally two Smirnoff ice and I'm drunk. I drive and spend rather recklessly and I find myself dissociating and unable to really change my off the wall actions. I also have a history with self harm.

I've read that BPD is often hard to diagnose because people with it don't want to be criticized so they won't mention shitty things they do. Because of that, I feel like a fraud, like if I really had it I couldn't be this self critical. I've had some of these symptoms for a long time, but stuff like the dissociating is very recent, like within the last year. The only stable relationships I have are with my wife and my mother. I go through "friends" like water and I admittedly am a terrible judge of character so I pick them poorly. 




 My mom is my best friend. She supports transpeople, just not me transitioning. She fostered over 50 children, partly because she was infertile. Almost all of those children were boys. She wanted a daughter so bad. When she got pregnant with me, she was 38. She says she knew immediately that God wouldn't make her wait 16 years for a sick boy and that I was a healthy girl. She had my brother two years later; my older brothers were adopted before me. 

When I came out as gay, she struggled with it. That didn't last long, but at that time she made it clear that I could "transition ten years after (she) was dead." She reiterates that periodically as well. When I started keeping my hair short, she struggled, but I tease her and tell her that I brought home my high femme wife so I'm no longer obligated to be femme. 

In 2012, she ended up in the ICU for 11 days and almost died because of a whole host of medical issues we didn't know existed. We worked on them for two and a half years before learning that she has non alcohol related cirrhosis. She remained sober her whole life (her father was a drunk) so that she could avoid that exact problem. If you didn't know, there is no treatment or cure for cirrhosis. 

I don't get very many more years with my mom. I know that for sure. It's in the early stages, but it sometimes progresses very quickly. I don't want to waste what little time I have making her view me as a man when I know that is the last thing she wants to do. 




 I (20 AFAB) identify as genderqueer and transmasculine. I have done nothing to transition, medically or socially, because I don't want to risk my family for it. My mom got three sons and me and has made it clear that she will not support transition. Recently I've started to realize that I have a lot of symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder. One of the symptoms is inconsistent identity. I bounce around from full male to almost female identity all the time, but it doesn't feel the way genderfluid is often described; it's harsh and difficult and hurtful and confusing, not fluid at all. I also have depression and anxiety. I was reading the post about dysphoria and it's effects on you without you knowing and I was just wondering if this could be at all self inflicted. I know you guys and gals aren't trained mental health counselors but if you know anything, please share. I'm sorry if this sounds crazy or in any way transphobic, I don't mean for it to.

 So do my pups! Mya is Mya-Doodle-Do, Doodle Dog, and Doodle Bug. Reese is Reesey Puff, Fluffer Nutter and Fluff Butt. On a side note, my brother has a dog named Pope that is a black boxer, so I call him George Foremen or Georgie.  




 That's a great name for a cat! 




 That's adorable! What's his name? 




 I added pictures to the top. 




 They are named Mya, who is 3, and Reese, who is 2. I hate to play favorites, but Mya is like a super dog. She is protective, helps me during anxiety attacks and wakes me with kisses. She is also wicked smart. Her only bad trait is that she barks at all strangers. Reese on the other hand isn't as smart or sweet. She's a good pup but Mya is just perfect. 




 They're mutts. They are Yorkie, Chihuahua, Dauchsund, Cocker Spaniel mixes. One looks like a small black lab, the other looks a lot like a Dauchsund.

The solid black one is named Mya. She is 3, her birthday is February 29th. The one with brown is Reese, she's 2 and her birthday is April 5th. 




 This is freakishly close to my ravioli recipe. 




 Otherwise you'll serve barely warm ribs to your boyfriend's roommates. 




 Cam Tucker? 




 Goods and services can be e changed for money. 




 It is generally stated as distracting. Also, many districts opt to put students in in school suspension, not just home to change. Both truly are distracting to an education. I agree that situational appropriateness is important, I just don't see schools as really aiming to teach that. 














 How can you tell that I was shadowbanned? My wife went through and upvoted all of my posts for my first two pages, which She does periodically. I don't have any alts.  




 Those can he transmitted even with a clean mouth. 




 Do you recognize that disease can't be spread through a beard or a dirty mouth, but it can through blood and other menstrual fluids?  




 If that's true then I assume women are also made to remove peach fuzz. Otherwise, you are full of shit. Based on your irrational anger and name calling, I'm going to assume the latter. Have a nice day, and make friends with someone who can help you handle your mental health issues. 




 Except it's literally a health risk to everyone to have menstrual fluid everywhere. It isn't a health risk to have a beard. 




 I'm not saying he should quit his job to grow a beard. I'm saying razors aren't a necessity and that if *he* cares so much about it, then that's his solution. Not having to pay tax on a luxury item is not a solution. 




 You know women use razors too right? And he can always just get a different job. No one is forcing him to work there. Science forces me to bleed from my vagina and I can't have it all over everything. 




 I saw it in a video like 4 years ago and it came up on Google just now, so it might be. 




 For my monogamous marriage, that's the issue. Other people's relationships are not my relationships. 




 T can make you sterile but it also isn't considered an effective birth control. 




 No, *I* don't, but it's not my body or my child, so it's not my place to make that call. 




 Yes, they are. 




 Why does it matter? If no genitals or nipples are showing, it's not a girl's responsibility to keep a boy from looking.

Edit: do you guys realize that bottoms of buttcheeks are no more indecent than cleavage? If it's not indecent exposure, no one but the owner of the body or the owner of the body's parent gets to decide what shows. 




 I though Spider Man was from a bite from a specially bred super spider? Though, I've only seen the Toby McGuire movie. 




 Rub the negative side of a D battery on it. 




 Adding "Mc" to a name is appropriation of Irish naming roots and I will not stand for it. Somebody get me a chair. 




 Yeah....... Putting someone else at risk for STDs isn't the same as your partner jacking off because you aren't feeling it. 




 I think you're leaving something out. You come off a bit misogynistic, or at least completely oblivious, for other reasons. 

I am very high libido married to someone very low libido. She was low libido before we got married, but it got worse after. It isn't that she doesn't want to fuck me. She truly just can't get there. She can't force herself to be in the right head space. She also leads me on quite a bit. She'll spend a day promising me and sending me dirty texts and at night she just can't get there. Its not that she intentionally lied, she just isn't there, and that isn't her fault. 

You aren't wrong for wanting compatibility, but it seems like you never really tried to have a heart to heart with this girl about this. Her explanation sounds like she was raised to believe that sex is for marriage, and she feels shame for having it before. It's a really destructive mentality that causes a lot of issues. It sounds a lot like you got an answer you didn't like and didn't want to work on the issue.

For a lot of people, security and love are needed to feel comfortable to have sex. If she was asking you to listen more, she wasn't feeling enough of those things to be comfortable. 

You were a bit of an asshole in telling her that was the reason. You took something out of her control that you knew was an issue early on and threw it at her. Her libido is something she can't change. The only reason to give a reason when breaking up is so the person can work on themselves for their next relationship. All you did was make what already seemed to be a big insecurity worse. I think She dodged the bullet. 




 I don't get how she can be nine months pregnant with a fetus in her arms. 




 I watched that in World History in high school! 




 This sounds like something a sim would say. 




 Oh god. I'm a 20 year old woman and I say chauvinist. 




 Only vaguely related.

I used to be friends with this guy. One night, I'm driving him home cause we had been hanging out. We are all just chatting when he says to my wife and I, "Do you think Canada wants to kill us since we share such a big border with them?" I flipped out explaining to him why he was a goddamn moron. 

I worked for 18 months as a companion to a man with Down syndrome. It was mostly to help me build my resume as I'm a social work major looking into mental health, and it's related enough. The same guy as the Canada situation **tagged me** on Facebook in a picture of a cat with "Down syndrome". In fact, the cat was missing a facial bone and I explained why that was impossible and why saying it had DS was insensitive and actually extremely offensive. He said that people would do their own research and that he wasn't taking it down because he wasn't offending anybody. 

I no longer associate with that individual. 




 What word should have been used?  




 My mom has four children. We are 44, 32, 20, and 19. 




 Thank you! Yours is pretty snazzy as well! 




 Yep. She loves it there! I hope it's as good for you as it is for her. :) 




 I wish I could do that. I feel hopelessly committed to everything and even when all I need to do is stay home and be with myself I have no choice, I just have to go. 




 My best friend from middle school goes there! 




 My wife and I have been together almost 5 years. Our room is a mess and we often can't remember when one another bathed. It works for us though. 




 I'll go against the grain. It was too soon. I was 15 and had been dating my 16 year old girlfriend for 2 months. We both agree that we should have waited longer. Neither of us was really ready and it lead to a lot of issues in our relationship for a while. We're 20 and 21 and married now though so it couldn't have been all bad. 




 You're kind of socially retarded if you have no dating experience by college, especially if it's because of mom and dad.

Edit: I literally meant socially delayed, not trying to insult people with developmental disabilities. 




 Discouraging exclusive relationships is encouraging promiscuity. There is nothing wrong with promiscuity, but be aware of that. People date younger now, too, and your forbidding it won't change that. You are setting your child up to be an outcast. 

Sleepovers should not be allowed unless with people who are just friends. This won't stop sex, but will prevent it under your roof. Also, don't dismiss her relationship. I am married to a woman I started dating at 15. Her relationship may very well be real. 

I know you are trying to do what's right, but you aren't really in the right decade. 




 Same to you. :-) 




 Plenty of kids don't take it seriously enough at all. I've heard about parties where young gay men try to get it as soon as possible so they don't have to worry about going bareback. That's terrifying. I didn't mean to minimize it, just explain that it isn't as awful as it was 30 years ago. Its still not something anyone should want to have; it is still deadly. I'm sorry that my explanation came off as blas like AIDS isn't a terrible thing. For anyone reading this, AIDS is awful and not something to be taken lightly, it's just less awful than it was a few decades ago. 




 Can you explain why it riled you so much? My intention wasn't to hurt feelings, but to explain the common confusion of AIDS then and now. 









 Thank you for that! That makes me feel really good! 




 Do you set your own price or is it decided by Amazon?

 That's really shitty. I'm sorry you have had that in your life. 




 I'm basing that opinion on the men that I know, not any real evidence. You are beyond free to disagree. 

I subscribe MFA because I love the community and a lot of the stuff they post is great. I can't actually afford anything they recommend but it gives me an idea of what looks good and what to pair it with. There is also /r/lesbianfashionadvice and /r/boifashionadvice, which I mod but it's like totally dead air.
