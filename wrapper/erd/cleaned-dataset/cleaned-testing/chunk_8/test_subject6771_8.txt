 no, i still consider it art but there is a better place for it. We exclude fat art because they would eventually take over the sub. /r/alternativeart would like this. 




 Ahhhhh. Good call and good job  




 it's prolly the trans-fat and saturated fats that make it taste so good. you'll never be able to replicate that unless your a chemist.

 omg. i can feel the sarcasm coming through your words. that's a really unhealthy pie.  




 you don't have to explain yourself :) i'm the same way. I'm sure you've already read the ingredient listing on the back? Sometimes i write to these companies via email and act concerned about allergy info. you could always try that.

 yes, you really should. i like it.

 we have "rotating" banners. click your refresh to view others in random. 




 it's actually kinda coincidental you posted this and then we implemented new banners a day ago. when i've had them done for over two weeks now. 

i think it looks great as a banner dont you think? 


edit: we're always looking for new mods that want to contribute to the network on a regular basis. ;) 




 Yes! Mos def thank you very much for the plug. We're very gracious.  




 my apologies. i thought we were talking about /r/imaginarymindscapes. i was confused.  




 *uggggggghhhhh.* i'm sorry. 

 




 no, i didn't draw this. and you've commented on plenty of my submissions to know that i'm just another ordinary user on reddit like everyone else. but i am interested in knowing how you feel about the sub.

unlike some other stuff I could link.


could you elaborate and explore this statement for me? I'm very interested in hearing your thoughts.


do you feel like the sub has changed since it's initial offering?  




 /r/disappointedboners??? 




 prolly from one of the links i posted :P 

another hidden gem sub, if you ask me.

 The bust of the late Philippine strongman Ferdinand Marcos lies badly defaced Monday, Dec. 30, 2002 at Mt. Pugo, La Union province in northern Philippines, a day after it was ripped in a powerful explosion shortly after midnight Sunday. The explosion ripped off the eyes, nose, ears and most of the upper part of the bust but did not topple it from the top of a cliff overlooking the South China Sea, where it was erected in the 1970s, allegedly to immortalize the strongman who was toppled in a near bloodless "People Power" revolution in 1986.
