 The bible has nothing to do with anything. At all. Ever.

You're an atheist when it comes to everyone else's god and you feel the exact same, I am guessing, about things in other religious books you probably haven't read.

If you don't like the idea of gay marriage, then limit your own life and who you can marry. No one will take that freedom from you - except maybe religious people. 
























 Has that happened with interracial marriages? Or previously married couples? Sounds like more scare mongering. 









 Let's see how the conservatives handle this one :)

"Oh, he was just some lone wolf with mental issues and took too many prescription medications!" Oh wait. NOPE.

Gonna be "See, he represents all of the group! They are all just alike! It's what we have been saying all along."

Gotta love conservatives..... 



















 Conservatives. She sinned by having a baby out of wedlock which means god will send storms on America. Or something like that. 



















 Damn you, you evil socialist, marxist, commie, kenyan born Obama.

Why aren't you doing what the right swore you would back in 2008/2012 - destroy the stock market, seize all guns, ban all wood burning stoves, put people in fema camps, start a caliphate, make unemployment 200%, etc and so on?

I swear, you keep letting down those poor right wingers. No wonder they don't like you. 









 Republican plan: "Pray about it. Jeebus will heal you" which is about the only medical plan they endorse. 




 No, but the conservatives who pimp it surely have. Man...this whole shooting and flag thing has cons coming out of the woodwork to defend the shooter (by seeing him as an 'individual' with mental problems and not as a 'white' or conservative) and the con flag. 

















































 I'm in my 40's, my meat is still good..... 




 "We didn't start the fire, but the blah blah blah blah blah...." 




 How is it fascist? Oh right....the conservatives use that word when someone they don't agree with whips their ass in the US. Gay marriage, gays in the military - and them freedom loving patriots go bonkers because some people got freedoms. 




 Big business can do no wrong in the eyes of the right. This may help amazon's image and profit, so salute them rw'ers - money is the god of the right. 

 




 Yeah, I saw lots of righties falling for this one.

Just like the ole 'Obama is gonna ban wood burning stoves/fireplaces' and the old 'Obama banned the don't tread on me symbol the army was using' and so on.

All lies, but the right never checks. They sure are skeptical of climate change issues though. Funny how their mind works. 










































































 Free Willy!

Oh wait, wrong movie. 






















































 They are a business and can do what they think is best for their business. I fully expect the right will applaud this decision as it is about money - the one true god of the right. 



















 There are quite a few. My understanding is that civil war statues in the south face north, and those in the north face south.

 Naw, just more responsible gun owners. 







































 The dog was a mutt, ran up towards the officer when the door opened. Shot missed (obviously) and the family quickly got the dog under control (this according to local news anchor at 10tv). 




 Go for it, I am sure you know how to post. 




 I know that about (I listen to 700wlw most the day, they talked about it a lot).

Problem is, the cops are our employees and answer to the people. We can't control what civilians do but those that we pay and empower we can exert control on.

We give cops a lot of power. They answer to us. And as their employer I like to keep up on what they are doing (especially since I am a former cop from the 80's and know just how iffy they can be at times). 



























































 Some cons on the net are saying yes - but only if they are Christians.

No surprise there.

 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional officials say the House will attempt as early as Thursday to revive trade legislation sought by President Barack Obama and blocked last week in a revolt by union-backed Democrats.

The officials say the vote would come on a stand-alone measure that would allow Congress to approve or reject future global trade deals, but not change them.

The Obama administration is seeking the authority as it works to wrap up a deal with 11 Pacific Rim nations.

A provision to renew a program of assistance for workers who lose their jobs because of imports would become part of a separate bill. 
























 Same with the rent. 












































 Is the password "Pencil"? 




 Ah, so, it's about revenge! "I had to do something I didn't like, so now I wanna make others do the same. Cause Freedumb!"

Yeah, sorry, that logic ain't working as a good reason for anything. 




 How did we get by all these years with voting with no pic ID? 

I can't recall ever having to show ID when I voted and I am 49. You're registered, you see your name on the list, sign your name, vote. What do people think is going to happen next? I am going to drive to another polling place, wait in line again, find someone Else's name and forge it?

We have laws against that already. It has been shown to be a rare issue. But now, suddenly, people are freaking out about it and think that we are all crazy law breaking vote fraud loving citizens.

They have in their mind that voter fraud like this is all over the place because people are talking about it. Create an issue that doesn't exist, talk about it a lot, create solution. 




 What's it say about photo id's in the constitution? I mean, I usually hear the right say things like that (re: welfare/etc) when they don't like something.

America has become the land of mistrust. We believe everyone might be a terrorist, so not water bottles on planes, security high at every sporting event (where women can't carry their purses, etc), we have a view of each other that we are all gonna commit vote fraud (hey, there is already a law against that, right?).

How long have we even had photo id's in the US and can't people make fake ones like they do now for bars? The solution is in search of a real problem.

It's high time we got back to seeing each other as fellow Americans and not all criminals laying in wait. But the right loves fear (which is why they are pushing to invade Iran now, etc) and always pushing for less freedoms in the name of 'security'. 




 Lowering taxes on the rich will help the economy.

Iraq has WMD, will only cost 60 billion for a short war. 

I'll shrink the government. Reduce the deficit.

And what happened? Stocks lower than when he took office, no wmd's, over a trillion for the war, recession, housing market collapse, banking/etc near disaster.

Need I say more? And all you got is that we didn't go to war and some minor issues not unlike those we had when we started social security - and it is still better than the no plan the cons had.

Obama isn't perfect by any means, but I'll take Obama over anyone the RW has had to offer or bush. That dude was an embarrassment and a failure of epic proportions. And where are we now? Not spending a trillion on the wars, economy has recovered, stock market higher than ever before.

The right just likes to whine. 




  In Mr. Kerrys case, the senators want to know why he hasnt done more to put pressure on other countries to take back their immigrants when the U.S. wants to deport them. Under that 2001 Supreme Court ruling, known as the Zadvydas case, if other countries wont accept their citizens, the U.S cannot usually detain them for longer than six months. Every year, thousands of immigrants are put back on the streets because of Zadvydas.
 
 Republicans have long pressured the State Department  under both President George W. Bush and now under President Obama  to use diplomatic tools such as denying visas to top officials try to force other countries to take their citizens back.

So....explain how this is the fault of Obama? Congress has to change the rules (and they have tried, but republicans stopped one of their own's bills on just this - and I don't blame them, it was a bad bill by rep King). 









 Ah, you mean the pledge of allegiance republicans made to some man over the pledge they swore to when elected?

Republicans....they really, really, don't care about the country - but kneeling before some guy they are all for.

I will never, in my lifetime, vote for another republican (which I did from 1984-2000). They have turned they backs on this country and it's people. 




 Yet conservatives are all for at will employment states and such. I was always told no company would can someone if they were making them money. Has the right changed their minds on that? 




 Was it Alvin Straight from "The Straight Story?" :) 


































 They aren't even debating what's in the legislation, just spouting off. I don't think anyone listens to anyone there, they know how they are going to vote and just blather on for show. 



















 Just replace them with siri, would be more intelligent than the cons in congress now. 




 I love how hillary trolls conservatives :) They watch every little thing she does, write about it, comment on it, post about it.

She owns em. If they had done that with bush we probably wouldn't have had 9/11, wars, recession, stock market down (first time a ever it was lower than when a prez went into office), housing crash, banking implosion, etc.

Instead, conservatives waved their flags, thumped their bibles, and saluted their boss.

But then...no one ever accused them of being smart or consistent. 




 yeah, it is - but voting to authorize the use of force isn't the same as voting to use force. It was still Bush's call - and he abused his power.

In the end, it's still on him and she can just say she was voting to allow the president to act in the event he needed to.

All in all - bush owns it, no one else. 




 Man...conservatives can be dumb as rocks.

"Hey, I gets my news from deadbart and worldnut daily cause I am super smart! Git r done!"

I really worry about the future of this country when there are folks who vote for republicans and read 'news' from such sites....but then again, they believe in some god that makes no sense. 









 For the MODS in case this station changes it's title too:

http://imgur.com/w3Y1m6F 









 Meh, they changed the title. I will write the station to complain. 




 And he has a lot more karma than you. Seems yours is in the negative territory. Like, trollishy low..... 
























 Cons have investigated this more than 9/11 (and anthrax). They don't honestly care or want answers. 

Remember how they rallied around bush, claimed to attack him was unpatriotic, blame the terrorists, etc?

Yeah...their patriotism is pure BS. 




 What's a shocker? Do tell :) 




 ROFL did OP actually read the article?

Here is what was there (from their link):
But the numbers of employers that say they intend to make the type of capital investments that eliminate jobs through automation doubled, to 59 percent.

So....before the min wage is even hiked business were, as they often do, planning on capital investments in machinery.

Stupid deadbart is predictable, I can't believe anyone is dumb enough to believe them.  


































 Indeed. I am not adding any shortcuts for now (except in my toolbar for politics/news)

I am also noticing firefox crashing about once a day now. Not to mention the god awful memory leaks.

The reason I use it over chrome: photobucket plugin and how turns most all headlines in caps to proper case (saves a lot of time). If chrome did that on the fly I would use it more.

If I come across a solution will let you know. 

































































































































 Udate:

She told the station that race was the main factor as to why she confronted the other woman. Moments before the fight the woman said she heard the other woman in the motorized scooter shouting racial comments to an African-American worker.

Amber told WZPL that she confronted the woman about her use of the derogatory language. The woman on the scooter sprung out of her set and began shoving the other woman.
