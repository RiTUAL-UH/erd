 I (thought I) had a really good friend when I was younger, a girl I went to school with. She and a bunch of other kids and I were all in advanced classes in middle school, and we were all pretty close up through high school. At first things were pretty great, but then there was a time in 8th grade when she just stopped talking to me for like a month. My other friends said she was mad at me, but I didn't know why. I'm usually pretty chill and easy to get along with. When I asked her about the reason she was mad, she just got all huffy and just said "you should know why." 

Eventually she and another of my friends (whom she had apparently been talking to behind my back and had convinced to take her side) showed up to our group's lunch table with a list of grievances. She filled an entire page with bullshit she was mad at me about. Most of it was stuff so petty and minor I didn't even remember it happening. But some of it was incredibly hurtful - and a lot of the more hurtful things were outside my control. For instance, she looked down on me because I said I was interest certain things she liked, but unlike her I'd never actually pursued them. She saw that as me being some kind of poser who lied about stuff to get people to like me. What she hadn't considered was that my family was incredibly poor (not to mention incredibly dysfunctional), so although I was genuinely interested in a lot of her hobbies I would never be able to afford to try them. I merely wanted to share my friend's passion, regardless of whether or not I could do it to the same degree. 

So after they spent over half the lunch period assaulting my character right in front of all my closest friends, and then told me that I was also bad at taking criticism - another load of bull, because if she'd told me about any of that shit earlier I would have definitely apologized and tried to do something about it - I had enough. I was in tears by that point, and simply left, choosing to sit at the other far end of the table. A few of my other friends saw how upset I was and tried to make me feel a little better, saying that my former bff had been very harsh and asking if I was okay or there was something they could do. But I spent most of the rest of the day feeling miserable anyway. I had never been made to feel so small and insignificant by a close friend before, and it hurt. 

Not one to hold a grudge, I forgave her and we made amends. Although she was still very elitist, and would hoard grievances like food for the apocalypse, she didn't ever do a repeat performance of the lunch room list. So as far as I was concerned, all was well. But I should have taken that as a sign of things to come. 

Fast forward about three years. Now we're all in 11th grade, and still all friends. Up until the previous summer I had never dated anyone or had a boyfriend. However, one of the guys in our friend group had a crush on me since 7th grade. In the past I had repeatedly turned him down and said I only wanted to be friends. This was partly because I hadn't wanted to date in general, but mostly because he was a prick. I was only friends with him because he was friends with my other friends.

This is relevant because I actually did start dating someone over the summer before 11th grade started. We met through mutual acquaintances and really hit it off, so after two months of dating we decided to tell all our friends. Most were surprised I had a boyfriend but still happy for us. The guy who had a crush on me ignored us, and started avoiding me at school.

I figured he was disappointed someone else was with me because he liked me, but he would eventually get over it. Nope. Instead he told everyone else how I apparently led him on and was terribly cruel to him (all bullshit, I told him from the beginning I didn't like him or want to date him). Pretty soon he suddenly seemed very close with my laundry list friend - which was odd, considering she HATED him before and even wrote a song about how creepy he was. At the lunch table, they started icing me out of conversations and generally made me feel unwelcome to the group. Once again, my friend was clearly mad at me but wouldn't tell me why. So I just said fuck it, I'm tired of all the lies and drama and being vilified for doing absolutely nothing wrong. I stopped being friends with both of them, and sat with another group of friends at lunch. 

I was told later by my actual best friend that the guy had been making up a lot of stuff about me, including how I had apparently driven him to attempting suicide. She knew he was lying because he said he tried to hang himself and his voice was raspy, but only when he thought he thought she was listening - 15 min after telling her this she caught him talking to some other people perfectly normally, and not a bit depressed, but when he noticed her he suddenly got all raspy and sad again. 

As for my former best friend, I'm fairly sure that she swallowed all the lies this guy was telling as it gave her another excuse to look down on me and be mad at me. I probably shouldn't have been surprised that they would team up in their distaste for me, but I was still upset that someone who claimed to be my friend would believe the bullshit from a guy she couldn't stand and would turn against me without even asking for my side. After that I said good riddance and only kept good friends in my life, so ultimately I'm better off for it. 




 I have this watch. For like the first 3 months after I bought it I would giggle a little bit every time I looked at it. 




 That chart is stupid and awful, seriously don't listen to these dudes who keep saying she's crazy just because she offered you casual sex. How is admitting you'd like to have sex with someone crazy? 




 What the fuck, dude. A woman wanting to have sex does not automatically make her crazy. NEWS FLASH, some women like having sex just as much as some men do because WHAT DO YOU KNOW having sex is a biological drive that all humans have to some degree or something???

You cannot possibly tell just by her offer of being FWB with OP that she is unstable or crazy. That is bullshit. Also bullshit - the idea that someone who has casual sex MUST have an STD. Nope. People who don't practice safe sex are more likely to have STDs, but you can get an infection from your first time just as easily as you can on your thousandth time. Stop filling this kid's head with stupidity. 




 ManLeader and That_Irate_Guy are right on this one. There is no special ~spiritual connection~ when you have sex with someone. Sex is just sex. The only things sex can give you besides the act itself is what YOU choose to attach to it. Wanting to have sex is natural and healthy - and having sex with someone is not giving away any part of yourself. That's just bullshit that religious conservatives spout in order to control their women-folk. The only reason that sexual relationships were ever attached to the idea of a "special connection" was so that people could try to control lineage and inheritance, and neither are nearly as relevant today as they were a few centuries ago. 




 Although virginity is overvalued in our society (especially for girls), I still think that you should be able to choose to lose your virginity on your own terms. If you would be more comfortable having sex for the first time with someone you trust and have developed a relationship with, then that's what you should do. You shouldn't have sex just to get it over with or just because you can - you should have sex because you want to. Good on you, OP, for sticking to what you want.

Also, like a lot of people have said, it's often a bad idea to sleep with coworkers because it can lead to a lot of drama. So it would probably be best if you didn't take her up on her offer anyway. 




 If she seriously thinks that having her wedding and house paid for will make a marriage magically work, not only is she dead wrong, but she still has a lot of growing up to do. There's no doubt, your daughter is straight up spoiled, and not only does she not appreciate your money (or your feelings) but it seems she is under the delusion that she shouldn't be responsible for her own relationships. I would second the idea that she should get some counseling, and you were right to stop enabling her. It might hurt when she says those awful things to you, and her feelings are probably hurt too, but in the long run you're doing your daughter a lot more good by standing firm in your decision. 




 You know, gay men might not get pregnant, but STDs are still a thing you can get regardless of pregnancy. Thus why I highly encourage girls/women to use condoms even if they're on the pill.

 a turkey baster shaped like jodie fosters knuckles 

That's very oddly specific. You have some strange kitchen implements.  




 I'd also heard variants that you shouldn't give a boyfriend/girlfriend a sweater, but it's okay to give to a fiance/spouse. The idea is that you shouldn't commit to such a huge project until you both commit to the relationship, otherwise you put all the time in for nothing if you end up breaking up with them. 




 You look like you had a lot of fun making this lol. Also I share your wish for identity denying assholes and their high horses to drown in a non-superpower-giving pool of acid. 




 Unless of course you have a gay son and a lesbian daughter, in which case with a boy you have to worry about all the penises and with the girl you don't have to worry about any. 




 I'm an asexual woman, but panromantic and I would totally be willing to have a relationship with a woman or someone who was non-binary. But I have been dating the same guy since I was 16, so I know how you feel. Definitely not the only one. 




 I actually had a communications seminar that was based on TED Talks and did a talk on asexuality for my final project. If you want to PM me, feel free and I can share some of my notes with you. 




 Oh! I'm so sorry, I don't mean you should expose yourself to sexual situations, only conversations about sex. I read back through my reply and realized I didn't clarify that at all. I didn't mean to imply you should have to have sex or watch porn or anything.

It might help if you just practice saying stuff out loud that normally makes you uncomfortable when you're by yourself, until you gradually get used to that. Then maybe you could get your friends on board and have practice conversations with them. That way you'd know how to handle it if it comes up in everyday situations. 




 This is true, but the show also does a really good job of making it absolutely clear that being a eunuch and being asexual are not the same thing. Eunuchs could still wish for something they couldn't have, which Varys says he never wanted in the first place. Being castrated did not affect his identity. So at least in my opinion, having the only openly asexual character be a eunuch is forgivable, especially since it's one of the few shows that will even openly admit we exist. 




 It is a bit fast, but honestly there isn't much to worry about. Sometimes you just find a really good fit, and I think this is one of those times. I appreciate the concern, though - I understand why it would seem rushed. 




 TL:DR; I told my mom I was poly and I had gotten engaged to my second partner, she took it well. Any advice for someone introducing a partner to their family for the first time?

I'm still freaking out a little right now, and kind of nervous, but overall the outcome was good! I just wanted to share, and maybe get some helpful advice or at least sympathy from people who've done this before.

Quick background: I have only ever been in two relationships, both of those with my current partners. The first one, Andy, I started dating when we were in highschool (over six years ago) and the second, Justin, I started seeing seven months ago, although we've been friends over a year. Andy and I have had an open relationship off and on for the last three years, but I never had a second partner or even dated anyone besides him until Justin.

I've been really worried for a long time about telling my mom I'm poly. Originally it was because the first time Andy and I decided to open our relationship failed miserably and my mom knew all about it. I didn't want to tell her about Justin until I knew it was serious, so that I could potentially quell any doubts she might have about whether or not dating two people was a good idea. More recently, I still hadn't told her about Justin because we haven't been on as good of terms - nearly every time we had a conversation we ended up fighting about money, which is definitely not the best time to tell someone "oh by the way I have two boyfriends."

Anyway, I posted on here recently about how Justin proposed, so it wasn't like I could keep him secret forever. So I planned on taking a weekend trip back to my hometown so he could meet my mom and sister. I called her tonight to tell her about it, and the conversation went something like this:

Mom: When are you and Andy coming back to town?

Me: Oh, I'm not coming up with Andy.

Mom: Who are you coming with then?

Me: Justin.

Mom: Who's Justin?

Me: My new fiancee?

Mom: Whoa, wait a minute, back up. What happened to Andy?

Me: We're still together.

Mom: [Confused] As in friends, or romantically?

Me: No, romantically. I'm engaged to them both.

Mom: Does Andy know about this?

Me: Yeah. He's fine with it. We're poly.

After that I explained to my reasonably confused mother what ethical nonmonogamy was, how our relationship worked, and that I really love both Justin and Andy and yes I was aware that this was complicated and there was a risk of getting hurt but we had all talked about that.

Overall, though, she said that she loved me no matter what and that she would support me, she just wanted to make sure I was happy. She also said she'd like to get together so Justin could get acquainted with her, her husband, and my younger sister. She even offered to let us stay with them in her new house (assuming it was okay with her husband), although we'll probably turn them down in favor of a hotel since Justin has said he isn't quite comfortable staying with complete strangers, even if they are my family, which I totally get.

I was so nervous about telling her about this for so long, it feels so weird now that it's finally out. But I'm really glad she's been supportive so far - I was really afraid that she wouldn't approve and it would put a strain on Justin. He tends to feel guilty if he feels like he's stressing me out (regardless of whether or not it's actually his fault, which it usually isn't) so it's good that things are going pretty smoothly.

Now I'm nervous for a different reason, although it's not as bad obviously. I've never had to go through the whole "introducing my partner to my family" scenario before. Andy and I started dating when we were 16, and he came over to hang out at my house before we started dating, so the introducing-your-date-to-your-family thing never happened there. If anyone has some advice I would really appreciate it! Otherwise, I hope you all have a lovely weekend :D 




 That sounds like a really tough situation, and I'm sorry you had to go through all that. I have gone through court cases involving family members before so I know it's incredibly nerve racking to be in the same court room as your abuser.

There are a lot of reasons why your father's family hasn't contacted you, but speaking as someone who also cut off contact with their father (well, technically stepfather in my case but he adopted me when I was very small) I can maybe give some insight to your situation.

I ended up completely cutting my stepdad out of my life a little over two and a half years ago, although I had slowly been phasing him out before then. I had two major reasons: my brother was physically and emotionally abusive, which my stepfather refused to acknowledge; also, he was emotionally abusive as well, and neglectful, and I could no longer continue to deal with his shit while also maintaining my mental health. For a long time afterward, I didn't hear from his family at all, and I asked a lot of the same questions you did during that time.

Later on I finally heard from his sister, who had been kindest to me over the years. One day she found me on facebook and invited me over for dinner, just her and her kids and me. I had a good time seeing them again, and when she took me back to a friend's house I was staying at for the summer I finally had a private moment to talk to her.

At that point, she asked me why I had abandoned my father and if it was because of the divorce he was going through with my mother at the time. I was astonished to find out that she knew barely anything about my brother's behavioral issues, and after telling her about the recent interactions I'd had with him (where, by the way, he threatened to kill me multiple times), she suddenly understood why I was having so many issues with my stepdad, who was complicit in the abuse from my brother.

Although I'm still on shaky ground with his family, I can tell you that there's a good chance they don't have any idea how bad things are for you right now. If you like your father's family and want to maintain a relationship with them, or even just want closure, you should try to contact them. Tell them your side of things, let them know what is going on, and they might surprise you.

All the best. 




 And what criteria are you using to determine whether a stranger one the internet, after a mere few paragraphs of describing one issue that they have, must be clinically depressed? Which, by the way, "clinical depression" is not a diagnosis.

This sort of comment is not at all helpful and only serves to reinforce the idea that non-heteronormative people are all crazy. And the whole "there must be something wrong with your hormones" line is so overused around asexual people. Kindly refrain from spouting such harmful and irrelevant nonsense to people looking for serious help about their sexual identity in the future. 




 Well, the short answer is, you don't. Sexual identity isn't something you "get over," you either live with it, accept it, or try to hide it. Sometimes it can change over time, but it's not something you can just will away.

That said, this knowledge won't necessarily help you. It seems like what you want is not to "get over" being "asexualish" as you put it, but being more comfortable talking about sex or sexual situations as it's starting to affect your interpersonal relationships. There's nothing wrong with being asexual, and it's not something you should feel like you have to get rid of. But not wanting to be made uncomfortable by even the idea of sex? Although you shouldn't feel bad about being uncomfortable about it (you can't help it, it's okay) I can definitely see why you don't like being in that situation and it's probably something that you could actually change.

I'm not entirely sure how you would go about doing it, other than practice. If you slowly expose yourself to that sort of thing over time, you would most likely be able to gradually feel more comfortable with it (or at least less squicked out). 




 I really liked Makina's route, mostly because I preferred how they handled the similar themes found in Yumiko's route. My favorite route is still Sachi's though. Possibly because [](#s "I have PTSD, so I can relate to her struggles with trauma. Also, she is the only one who had a decent family that we actually got to see, unlike Makina and Yumiko who had terrible shitty parents and Michiru and Amane who seemed to have relatively normal families but we didn't see a whole lot from them"). 




 I just started [If My Heart Had Wings](https://vndb.org/v9093) and [World End Economica](https://vndb.org/v7184). I haven't gotten very far in either (haven't even made choices yet) because I just got them like a week ago. I usually make progress a lot faster than that, but I also got a lot of games for the holidays and I wanted to play those first since people were nice enough to give them to me.

Edit: forgot to link 




 No problem! I know that I would have had things a lot easier when I was younger if I knew there were other people out me like there and I had someone to guide me through it, and I'm sure a lot of people on here feel the same way, so if there's any thing I can do I want to help people out. If I had one wish for the next generation of aces, it would be that they wouldn't have to go through so many years of loneliness like we all did before the internet and research and whatnot. So I'm glad I could help you, even if it's only a little bit. :) 




 Yes, it's perfectly normal for you to feel confused. I went through a pretty similar experience growing up. I felt like something was weird or wrong with me growing up, then I discovered the asexual identity and community and I felt a lot better, but not all at once. I still have days, a few years after coming out now, where I have down periods and I still get that uneasy feeling. That's totally normal.

I'm glad you have some support with your sister. In my experience, most therapists have never heard about asexuality and I actually had to educate mine about nearly everything there is with being ace. The research on it is still very, very new - the first peer-reviewed study on it was only published about a decade ago, so this is understandable (if unfortunate).

I think you should come out to people as you feel more comfortable. Coming out doesn't happen all at once, it's a process, and a lot of people start with those who they feel safer telling - people they know will be supportive, like your sister. If you think your friends will also be supportive, telling them might help you gain more confidence to tell your family; plus, they will be there for you if other people don't take the news so well.

Welcome to our family, and I hope that everything goes well for you! Don't ever be afraid to ask questions here, or get advice, or even just vent to people. We're all here for you! 




 Yeah, there are lots of people who don't identify as male or female. I'm pretty similar to you, actually. I consider myself somewhere between genderqueer and agender. So you're not the only one ;) 




 Nope, it's not too early. Most people are pretty sure of their sexuality by puberty, and I've pretty much known I was ace since I was around 8. 




 Yes, I live in the U.S., but no, I most likely will not be legally married to them both. On paper I'll only be married to one of them, but I'll still have a ceremony for both. 




 I was so excited I didn't stop grinning the whole weekend. My face actually started to hurt. 




 Double woot! 




 Thanks! 




 I know, right?? Funny thing is, if you told me a year ago I'd be engaged to two guys I would have laughed in your face. Whenever my first partner and I decided to open up our relationship back then, I had no intentions of seeing anyone else. Then I pretty much fell ass-backwards into a date with the guy who is now my new fiance seven months ago, and things took off from there. 




 No, I don't. Actually my other partner and I are always broke because he just graduated college a few weeks ago and I'm still attending. Basically we agreed to get married a few months back but I don't have a ring from him. Whenever he does get a ring though, I will be sure to post it :) 




 You know, I didn't even think about that but now I can't stop hearing it either. 




 Thank you! 




  It isn't the haircut that makes me think this, it's fleeting but ongoing conversations/comments over the past 10 years.

I figured this was the case, I was mostly just trying to make a point about how sometimes we pick up cues that we think lead to one thing but actually lead to something else entirely. I'm glad you recognize this.

To be honest, I also went through a similar process as a kid. When I was super little I played with Barbies and my third birthday was all pink (except for the plates, which were Jurassic Park themed because I insisted). Then at the beginning of grade school, I shifted away from wearing skirts or dresses, started hanging out with mostly boys, and focused on more stereotypical male interests. I was always a tomboy, but during middle school I toned it down a bit. Mostly it was due to social pressure to conform. Sometimes it's easier to just compromise what you want for your outward appearance, rather than deal with other people constantly judging you for it.

I think one of the hardest parts about being out and obviously queer is that you have to constantly field questions and comments - some benign, others hurtful - from people who obviously recognize you as "different" and "other". I know one of the biggest reasons that I didn't come out for a long while is because I was very much aware of this difference and was tired of dealing with people about it all the time. Sometimes it felt like people were focusing so much on the way I dressed or who I was (or wasn't) with, they weren't actually seeing *me*. 

Of course, there are also times where you just get fed up with playing along, say "fuck that noise", and decide to just be you, even if that you is very obviously different. Just like your daughter I went from very long hair to cutting it all of at 14 over spring break, and I never looked back. So yeah, it's probably safe to assume that she's trying to negotiate who she is and how she expresses that with society's expectations of who she should be. We all go through that growing up, it's just not always so visibly obvious. 




 FYI, "gypsy" is considered a racial slur used against people who are Romani. A lot of people don't know that it's a slur, so I figured I would let you know. A lot of people who are Romani or of Romani descent are really offended by its use, as it was a term applied to them and not one they historically used or typically use today.

Now that that's out of the way, the pics are really nice and it's some good craftsmanship. Thanks for sharing. 




 Thanks! I appreciate it :) 




 You sound like a loving and concerned father, who wants to do all he can to do right by his children. So don't worry about making mistakes too much - your heart is definitely in the right place, and your kids seem like they are very much in good hands.

As for your concerns, if this is a major concern for you, then there is no reason you shouldn't talk with your kids about it. Of course you don't want to assume anything about your child's identity based purely on how they dress or cut their hair. I'm female-bodied and a lot of people assume I'm a lesbian because I wear men's clothes and cut my hair short in a typically masculine style, but that isn't even close - I'm actually gender nonconforming and asexual. Sometimes reality is much more complicated than appearances.

If I were you, I would approach this from "let's talk about this topic." There are plenty of times when parents talk to their kids about plenty of topics, and you can start the conversation like that. Just tell them you'd like to discuss trans people, because it's something you'd like to make sure they know about. Ask your daughter(?) what she knows about trans issues, and explain to her as best you can anything she doesn't know. You could potentially look at educational videos or websites for this, too. Make sure to express to her explicitly that you have no problems with trans people and you want to be a supportive ally. Sometimes just knowing that your family is vaguely not negative about these things isn't enough to make someone feel comfortable coming out to them - after all, this can be a matter of life or death for a queer or trans person. And tell her that no matter what, regardless of her sexual or gender identity, you will be there for her and you love her unconditionally. That kind of support is so crucial and can mean everything for a young queer or trans person. Then, if she is trans, hopefully she will feel comfortable coming out to you. Don't push the issue - she will come to you on her own time. Especially if she herself isn't sure of her identity or is just exploring possibilities with gender expression, she might not be ready to talk about it yet, and that's okay.

Hopefully all goes well, and I wish you all the best with raising your kids! Keep being an awesome dad.

Edit - accidentally hit send too early 




 Thank you! 




 Thanks! 




 The term "asexual" applies to anyone who does not feel physical attraction to any sex or gender. If you don't find yourself physically attracted to anyone, then you would be asexual. Of course, you are the only one who can choose to identify as such, so whether or not you use the label is up to you.

On that note, you do say you are attracted to people, but you didn't specify a type of attraction. Lots of asexual people sill feel romantically attracted to people (and this can be heteroromantic, homoromantic, biromantic, panromantic, etc. just like sexual attraction). If you've never heard these terms or are confused, usually physical attraction is being interested in someone's body or appearance, and thinking that you would like to be physically intimate with them (hugging, kissing, sex, etc.) while romantic attraction usually refers to things like being attracted to someone's personality, wanting to spend time with them, wanting to get to know them, or imagining a relationship with them.

If you experience physical attraction, but are repulsed by the act of sex itself, that's different than being asexual. Asexuality doesn't mean that you don't like sex - that's a common misconception. Although some asexuals are sex-averse and don't like sex at all, there are others who are neutral to it (I fall into this category) or who like and enjoy it. Studies show that people who identify as asexual tend to have slightly lower libidos on average, but still have plenty of participation in sexual behaviors.

All that said, I don't want you to feel like your feelings are invalid if you aren't asexual. Only you can really know what your identity is, but regardless you shouldn't have to do something for the sake of a relationship if you are made that uncomfortable by it. You should talk to your husband about this. Let him know that you just don't want to have sex, and why. There's a good chance he'll take it personally or assume you're no longer attracted to him. That's only natural - after all, even you considered that possibility. But this has nothing to do with him. You need to make sure to express that to him - there is nothing he's done wrong or could possibly to do make this better, you just don't like sex.

Also, I'd like to reiterate the suggestion you consider therapy. If your repulsion toward sex or how that repulsion is affecting your relationships is a concern for you, speaking with a counselor or therapist might help you work through that and figure out what you should do about it.

I hope that helps, and wish you well in the future. :) 




 Hey, everyone! I don't have a lot of people to tell about this, because only a select friend group even knows I'm poly, let alone dating two people. So forgive me, I just wanted to gush a bit!

This weekend, one of my partners popped the big question - and I said yes! We're engaged!! I'm so excited (and a little bit nervous). But more than anything I can't wait to be married to him. I am now officially ~double engaged~

Join me in my happy dance!!

Oh, and here's a picture of the rings he got us:
http://imgur.com/Lb4YvOC 




 Yeah, that sounds like you're probably aromantic. It means you don't experience emotional attraction to other people, or at least that it's so low or infrequent as to be negligable. You aren't the only one, and it's perfectly okay. 




 At least now you have an excuse to make a few cute baby clothes! Assuming you have time after taking care of the little one, of course. 




 I haven't ever had someone tell me they didn't really like a gift I hand-made for them that I can remember, but I do have anxiety about this pretty much every time I make something. The closer I get to finishing and giving it to someone, the more I sit there working on it thinking, "I've already spent like two weeks making this, what if they don't like it??" But I also only try to make things that I know people will really like and that are practical or at least related to something I know they love (for instance, I'm currently making a Doctor Who cross stitch for a couple who are friends of mine and pretty big fans of the show). I've also probably gotten pretty lucky.

Something I've had less luck with is people not showing appreciation for the time I put into these gifts, rather than not appreciating the final product. This year my mother texted me on Dec. 4th to tell me that she wanted three separate gifts made. One was some boot cuffs for my 13-year-old sister; I made three pairs finished those in a weekend. The next one was a little tougher - a Batman hat for my 5-year-old cousin. That's what I've been working on for the past week, but I'm doing the finishing touches now, so it will still be done by the time I give it to him Christmas Day.

But the kicker was the gift she requested for herself. She wanted [this  shawl](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/25-13-shawl), which calls for super fine yarn, a 3.00 mm hook, and complex lace work. To top it all off, she wanted it to be either navy blue or dark purple. Most of my local yarn stores have hardly any options for lace weight yarns, and 99% of the ones they do have are either baby yarns (so pastel colors) or made from wool (which both of us are seriously allergic to). And she asks for all of these things exactly three weeks before Christmas. I was really pissed.

Thankfully my favorite LYS had ONE YARN that was 100% alpaca, a wonderful dark purple tone, and was only $10 per hank (I needed two). I'm pretty sure that's the closest to a Christmas miracle that I will ever get.

Needless to say, whenever I show up to visit her for the holidays with only like 15 rows done and she complains about not getting a gift I will definitely lay into her about it. 




 Okay so there are officially four people on Reddit who have both seen Princess Jellyfish and love crochet. MY PEOPLE 




 I don't think that her wanting OP to stand up for her is narcissistic at all. It's perfectly normal for people to expect that a significant other will have their back and will defend them to other people when they're being shitty.

In this situation, OP's gf cut her hair (which OP didn't say anything about, only that she couldn't dye it), and OP freaked out because he doesn't think his parents will like it. That might be the case, or they might not end up caring after all, but either way, I think the gf is reasonable to think that OP will still support her. It's not being rebellious to want to live by your own standards, not the standards of some other person's parents who have never met you and who quite frankly have rather bullshit standards anyway. You can't expect your parents to get along with every partner you ever have perfectly, and you shouldn't expect your partners to tailor themselves perfectly to all of your family members' tastes.

It would be one thing if it were over something major, like what sort of religious ceremony they'll have for their wedding or how they'll raise their kids. But this is a freaking haircut. If OP's parents want to get all up in arms over something that will grow back in a few months anyway on someone else's head that they likely won't see very often regardless, then that's their prerogative. But OP and his gf shouldn't have to put up with that, and it's a stupid thing to care about. Plus, if OP isn't willing to go to bat over something that is relatively minor and at most should only get one or two passive aggressive comments or negative looks, then it doesn't bode well for them when they DO finally get to tougher issues. 




 On the one hand, I get where you're coming from. Having parents or other family with different views from you can sometimes make things pretty difficult or awkward, especially when someone else you care about forces you to confront this difference. I've had to deal with several family members and their homophobic views whenever I talk about queer issues (many of my friends and I myself are queer).

On the other hand, I've also been in your girlfriend's shoes. It can be incredibly frustrating when someone you care about disapproves of your choices, especially when they personally don't care but are afraid of what other people might think.

I had a similar experience earlier in college. I went to the same college as my boyfriend, and I didn't get along with my bf's roommate very well. On more than one occasion I had arguments with this roommate, and my bf would often get upset at me. He told me that it stressed him out when the person he was in love with and the person he was living with didn't get along, because it put him in the middle. He often tried to tell me to avoid conflict with this person, because the way he argued it, I might have a fight with him for a few minutes, but he would be the one having to live with the guy for the rest of the year, so it wasn't worth it.

However, this was incredibly hurtful to me. Like your girlfriend, I was upset that my boyfriend didn't want to stand up for me, especially because we'd been dating for years but this guy was just some douche the university assigned him to live with. To me, having to live with a slightly awkward roommate situation for a semester or two paled in comparison to potentially ruining the romantic relationship you have had and potentially would continue to have for much longer.

Of course, your situation is different. This isn't a roommate you're talking about - someone you can never see again and probably not care that much. It's your parents. You probably love your parents a lot, and your gf a lot, so those feelings of being caught in the middle are most likely pretty intense.

What you should remember, though, is that you aren't the only one who is feeling this discomfort. Your gf probably doesn't feel that great either, because your parent's views seem to be that people like her are somehow wrong or unworthy or whatever. And if you admonish her for doing something your parents might not like, in a way you are also telling her that you don't think she's good enough either. I know you don't mean it like that, but that's how it can come across - she might be seeing this as "you think your parent's shitty opinions are more important than me being able to just be who I am and feeling good about that." OP, I can't tell you how to feel about all this, but there's a good chance that's how your gf is feeling, and hopefully that knowledge might help you out a little.

If I were you, I would make sure to tell your gf what YOU think of her hair. She was obviously excited about showing you her new 'do, so she probably wants your approval. If your first reaction was "what will my parents think??" then that would make her upset too. So if you haven't already, tell her how beautiful you think she is!

As far as your parents go, whenever you take her to meet them, stay casual. Don't make a fuss about her hair. If they bring it up, and say something negative about it, then just tell them something like "I love my girlfriend and I think she's an amazing person. If you honestly think that something as trivial as a haircut is that big a deal, then you're not looking at who she really is." They might be tempted to judge her on appearances, but hopefully they'll be reasonable enough to realize that ultimately what's important is that you are happy with this person - a person who is the same inside regardless of how short her hair is. 




 Yep. And I'm an X. Yay for breaking scales! 




 And of course, not all people who identify as bi like men or women equally either. It's almost like human sexuality is this really complex thing that doesn't fit neatly into label boxes, lol. 




 On the other hand, I have known a few people who identify as bi but are only attracted to, for example, women and androgynous people but not men. "Bi" implies only two, and not which two those are, so the use of pan more explicitly says "no I like everything." Still though, like you said, people have the right to choose their own label and I know a lot of folks who use "bi" because not many people know what pansexual means or have never heard the term before, but generally get the idea behind bisexuality. 




 I teared up a little reading that. I have had a lot of the same feelings when thinking about whether or not to come out to some of my family members. It's rough sometimes. But hey, you'll always have your internet family, yeah? 




 For some reason the first thing that popped into my head was that the creeper was possessed by a demon and that's why its head got turned around 




 That's what I was trying to get at. I'm pretty sure the other person was objecting because of the context of OP's post, but I agree that as long as both friends are okay with it then it's fine to have more intimate touching. 




 I'm really glad so many people on here are telling you to stick up for yourself. Because it's true - if these people were really your friends they wouldn't want to do anything to make you uncomfortable. And if they can't handle their liquor, they have no business getting drunk. 

I've gotten smashed with my friends a few times, but I've never inappropriately touched one of my friends. Why? Because I respect other's boundaries when I'm sober, and even if I'm drunk, I still feel that way. Yeah sure we all do silly or embarrassing things sometimes while drinking, but harassment is never okay. If your "friends" think it's okay to touch you because they're drinking, odds are they never had much respect for your personal boundaries to begin with - and that's not someone I want to be friends with. 




 Intimacy in a friendship is fine, as long as both parties agree to that. But the issue here is that OP never consented, and you really shouldn't start randomly groping your friends without their permission. It's a whole separate issue than if you and your friend have a mutual understanding that touching is okay. 




 But if they wanted me to yarn over wouldn't they use yo for the notation? Thus my confusion.

Oh well. In any case I'll try it, because it ends up with the same number of stitches and that's all that really matters.

Thanks!

 Hello, fellow knitters! I come to you seeking your infinite wisdom on all things knitting. Usually my google-fu and YouTube will help get me through any questions I have about new stitches, but this time around I'm not getting squat on my search results so I figured it was time to reach out for help.

I'm currently working on the [Buttercup Scarflet](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/buttercup-scarflet) pattern I found on Ravelry, and I'm on row 3 of the pattern repeat (so frustrating, I've got barely 2 inches and I already have to stop). The row reads like this:

 Row 3: K1, P1, K1, sm, P4, sm, Bundle 3, P4, K6, P4, Bundle 3, sm, P4, sm, K1, P1, K1

The part I'm having problems with is the "Bundle 3" stitching. The pattern defines the special stitches and here's what it says:

 Bundle 3 = wyib slip 1 st, (k1, yf, k1), psso the (k1, yf,
k1)

I don't quite get what they're wanting here, maybe I'm just being dense, but I've never done this stitch before. So I start with the yarn in the back, I slip one stitch, I knit a stitch, then I bring the yarn forward, and ... what? How am I supposed to knit the next stitch?

Someone please explain it to me like I'm five because I have no idea. 




 Or maybe it should go exactly as planned, because things going exactly as stated pretty much never happens in this series. The dramatic tension would be all of us going, "wait, she actually pulled it off? No way, it can't be that easy. Something has to go wrong." Cue paranoid readers biting their nails waiting for a downside that never happens and GRRM laughing maniacally. 




 Same here - I got a slightly older one refurbished. But no new laptop I've seen has VGA anymore. It's like trying to make an argument that we shouldn't update to DVD players because VHS still exists 




 This reminds me of a conversation I had with a professor the other day. I was complaining about how we have to either use an adaptor or a school laptop (which are hella slow) when doing presentations, because the school's projectors only have VGA and most of the students have newer laptops which use HDMI.

Me: "The university should really upgrade to HDMI. Nothing uses VGA anymore."

Professor: "Well they won't do that because they can't justify spending money on something that isn't standard."

Uh huh ... According to her, HDMI is too new to be considered standard. Meanwhile, literally every person who owns a laptop has an HDMI port. 




 I live in the US, and in my state teachers can retire at 55 assuming they've been teaching for 30 years. 




 I never understood why at a doctor's office where you can only make appointments and they don't take walkins you can be delayed for an hour and a half yet they expect you to show up 15 min early. Oh well. 




 A little stressful. I woke up at 5:30 AM and couldn't fall back asleep (I usually wake up around 8:30 AM so this is significantly earlier for me). Then I had a doctor's appointment at 9:30, which I was late to because Google Maps took me to 400 WEST street name instead of 400 EAST street name. Then despite getting there ten minutes late I still had to wait around for over an hour before the doctor actually saw me. And I will have to have another appointment on Friday to get some testing done. Ugh.

Meanwhile my classes have been pretty boring and I nearly fell asleep during a discussion because I was so tired :( 




 I have a hard time with cold. Let's compromise and have one that's kind off cold but not too bad ;) 




 Fuck it, let's just found an island country or something 




 Okay but what is the most liberal of all the states? I need to plan ahead so I don't accidentally end up in one that later becomes conservative lol 




 That is not a word I'm familiar with, and for context I'm a native English speaker from the southern US. But it does sound similar.  In the case of mansplaining though it's specifically a man doing it to a woman, because it's meant to describe a form of sexism. So a besserwisser might be mansplaining in that context, but not always. 




 Your chocolate scenario is a good example, but the term also applies to more objective topics. For instance, say a man tried to explain to a woman how computers work on a basic level because he assumes women aren't good with technology, but he doesn't realize she's actually a computer programmer and knows more than he does as just a common layman. That would also be mansplaining. 

Basically, woman is talking about subject. Man interrupts to give unsolicited "expertise" to supposedly enlighten woman. Woman already knows everything he said, or possibly he's just spouted a bunch of nonsense she knows is wrong. Woman declares man is mansplaining, as he assumed because of her gender that she's ignorant and because he is male his knowledge is more authoritative than hers. And a lot of men don't even realize they're doing it. 

To illustrate why so many women find this irritating, here's another comparison. Imagine you were a botanist with a doctorate, and you went to a conference to discuss sciencey plant stuff (full disclosure, I am not a botanist so just go with me here). In the middle of giving a presentation, a five year old runs up on stage to interrupt and tell you that plants grow because sunshine makes them happy. If you were in a good mood you might be amused by the kid's antics. But most likely you'd be annoyed that this kid interrupted your important discussion with other people who actually know what they're talking about to spout this nonsense. Now imagine that half the population was made up of five year olds, and most professors, politicians, police officers, doctors, etc. were also five year olds, and the society and culture as a whole supported the idea that the opinions of five year olds were more important than those of adults. See the problem?

Not to say, of course, that men are immature or don't know about anything, I was merely using the kid as an example of someone who had no possible way of fully understanding what they're talking about. The main takeaway here is that we all know more about some subjects than others, and you shouldn't assume you know more than someone else, especially based on that person's gender. 




 I can't tell if you're being serious or not? 




 Ah yes, thank you. I couldn't remember the name of it. 




 I live in Louisville, which is like the only mostly liberal part of a very conservative Kentucky. I'm so glad I moved here from my small hometown, living in a conservative environment is not so good for a queer person's health. 




 It's as they say, you have to be at least somewhat competent at something to realize just how little you know about it. And I'm glad you think so - that means a lot coming from you :) 




 Oh yes. Funny story, actually - my roommate and close friend once told me that when we met he was somewhat wary of me because I told him I was a psych major and I potentially wanted to go into counseling. He was really afraid I would try to diagnose him with a bunch of bullshit, like most psych majors he'd met, but was later surprised by how nonjudgemental I was. We became really good friends though and still live together. 




 No, mansplaining is more specifically when a man talking to a woman or group of women tries to act as if he knows more than the women do about a particular subject, when in reality he has no idea what he's talking about or might have some knowledge but not nearly as much as the woman does. This is especially true of situations where men try to posit themselves as experts whenever woman are taking about women-specific issues or female experiences. 

In this video the term is highly relevant, as whenever the female guest tried to explain why she doesn't like being cat-called, the male guest then proceeded to tell her that he's an expert in how men think and therefore he knows more about cat-calling than she does. He then states that all women want is to be told they are pretty, and that if the guy harassing her was hot she wouldn't care, despite her just stating only a few seconds ago that she doesn't like it when men give her unsolicited comments when all she's trying to do is get to work or run errands or whatever (and add the female guest points out, that has nothing to do with how men think, which he's supposedly an expert on, but how women think). He doesn't acknowledge what she says, just tells her why she is wrong about her own feelings, which he cannot possibly know more about than her. In a word, mansplaining.

Edit: typo, clarifying 




 It's not really an official diagnosis obviously, just a colloquial term for a common phenomenon lol. And yes, most likely your parents' biases have affected her. A lot of people will try to claim their beliefs are unbiased because SCIENCE. What they don't realize is that the researchers and everyone else interpreting the results are not nearly so objective as they like to believe. Even unintentional biases affect results. But the studies showing some sort of negative for lgbtq people (they're crazy, they're pedophiles, they are delinquents or criminals, etc.) have long since been debunked - that's why homosexuality was removed from the DSM in the 1970s and is no longer considered a mental illness. 




 Well like I said, that's part of the problem - there are different definitions out there for what romantic love is. But most people tend to agree that it's an "I know it when I see it" kind of thing. 

And yes, I would say that my feelings toward a romantic partner and a platonic friend are different, but again it's hard to pin down exactly when that line is crossed. There are things like having children or getting married, for instance, that you don't typically do with friends. But how is hanging out with a friend at the movies different from going on a date with someone at the movies (especially if the latter does not include sexual contact)? The actual actions don't matter as much, but the intent and feelings differ. And I think that's what it comes down to - what do the people involved call it? 




 I think that everyone views love a little differently, and therefore it's really hard to answer your question definitively. It is true that our society places a heavy emphasis on a physical component of love - after all, most people who say that they're in a sexless relationship are complaining, because usually when your partner doesn't want to have sex with you that's an indicator something is wrong. This is often used against asexuals - we're sometimes told by people that we aren't *really* in love with someone unless we are physically attracted to them; otherwise, how is our "love" any different from friendship?

But I would say that there are certainly some similarities between the love I feel for someone and the love a straight person might feel for someone. I know that I love someone because I feel a desire to spend time with them, they bring out the best parts of me, and I want them to be happy. I imagine us getting married, maybe having kids. I can't help but smile when they're around and I know they feel the same way about me. So yeah, it's entirely possible that aces and straight people can feel the same or similar kind of love. After all, love is not determined solely by your orientation. Sure, there are people who might feel love in different ways or who experience different kinds of love, but that doesn't entirely rule out the possibility, you feel me? 




 Hey! Welcome to our sub. I hope you find some good friends here :D

I am also studying psychology, and unfortunately your sister has a condition common in our field of study - PDS, or pseudo-diagnosis syndrome. In other words, she (and many other psych majors) have a tendency to try to diagnose family, friends, or casual acquaintances with psychological illnesses that they totally had to write a paper on once. Long story short, she's full of it. 

Not only is there absolutely no actual evidence that people who were abused later become gay or otherwise not-straight, she cannot possibly determine what your sexuality is or should be. You are the only one who can determine that. I know that it feels really awful and demeaning when someone dismisses your sexual identity (I've had family do it to me too when I tried to come out to them), but the good news is what she says doesn't have to affect how you view yourself or your ultimate happiness. She's wrong, and her continuing to not believe you can like girls and guys doesn't make you any less bi. The best thing you can do is just brush her off and keep being you. Science is not on her side, it's on yours - if you like, you can look up recent studies on human sexuality that talk about how common bisexuality is and show these to her. Who knows if she'll accept it, but in any case just know that there are people here at least who do believe you, and who are proud of who you are.

Good luck OP, and all the best! 




 OP, your bf is being ridiculous. There is nothing embarrassing about using a mobility device such as crutches, a wheelchair, or a scooter when you are clearly injured. And it is impossible to miss those boot things, so it's not like anyone would mistake you for one of these "lazy fat-ass slobs" he seems to be so concerned about. He has got some serious fat phobia and ablism issues if he's reacting this strongly to you using a scooter that you obviously need. You weren't embarrassing him or making a spectacle, you were being practical. The scooters are made specifically for people like you who are injured, or others like those who are elderly who have trouble walking for some other reason. Why should you be ashamed of using something for its intended purpose?

If I were you, I wouldn't take this lying down. He's so clearly wrong, it almost hurts. If anything he should be apologizing to you for being such an ass. And if he continues to make a fuss over this, I would highly consider dumping him. The kind of person who would try to belittle their injured girlfriend for using a motor scooter while shopping and then have the gall to act like it's somehow her fault he had issues with it is not someone who is worth your time. 




 That's fair. And like I said, I'm sure you meant well, it was just worded a bit weirdly. I totally understand wanting to make sure she has as much info as possible. Thanks for the clarification. Also, since we're sharing stories, I pretty much had the opposite experience as you - at first I thought I was most likely demi because I had a boyfriend and I didn't hate sex with him (I was under the incorrect impression that asexuals all hate sex). Then after a while I figured out that I am actually just ace, and having better sex didn't change that, but rather reaffirm my asexual identity. Funny how that stuff goes, huh? 




 I rather doubt that OP's sister is just having bad sex. The way she describes being physically repulsed seems very much asexual to me, especially when it goes beyond sex to not liking other things such as kissing. And having better sex does not make one suddenly become attracted to people. I'm sure you mean well, but your argument is rather is perilously close to the "but you haven't had sex with ME yet" or "maybe you just haven't had GOOD sex" arguments people often use to dismiss asexual identities. 




 Others have addressed the first two questions so I'd like to address number three specifically.

I identify as a panromantic asexual; in other words, I am emotionally attracted to all genders, but I am not physically attracted to people at all. I am rather neutral toward sex - although I don't mind having sex with a partner I am in a relationship with, I also have practically no sex drive and never initiate sex. Additionally, I am polyamorous and practice ethical non-monogamy. I believe that people are capable of loving more than one person simultaneously, and myself and my partners have a relationship format that is not restricted to only two people, with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved. I am currently dating two men, one of whom is also poly and currently seeing two other women besides me. The other is monogamous and I am his only partner.

So long story short, yes - it is totally okay to be with guys and not want to have sex with them, and it is totally okay if they have sex with someone else in order to fulfill their physical needs. The best way to go about this is an open and honest communication with your partner(s) - let them know what you want out of the relationship, ask what they want, and try to figure out where to go from there. If you really like a guy but the idea of having sex with them is totally unappealing (this makes it sound like you are asexual and sex-aversive or sex-repulsed to me), then tell them. Just say, "hey, I like you, but I just don't particularly like sex. It has nothing to do with you, it just isn't something I enjoy doing." If your partner is at all a decent person then they will be understanding about this.

At that point, you can then discuss sex in your relationship. Would your partner prefer to just abstain from having sex, or would they like to have sex with other people? That's up to them. If you are fine with them having a sexual relationship with someone else, that's usually referred to as an open relationship. My first partner and I have been in an open relationship for quite some time now; my second partner doesn't wish to date or have sex with anyone else, though. What's important is working out what is best for everyone. Also, make sure that you are clear about boundaries and what sorts of behaviors are acceptable. For instance, with my first partner, I have an agreement that we always use condoms and he will always use condoms with his other partners unless both he and the other partner are tested for STDs and are clean, and they notify everyone else they come into sexual contact with that they will not be using condoms. Also, we both let each other know when we are interested in someone else and if we will be spending time with another person to avoid scheduling conflicts. Other than that, he and I are both allowed to date whoever we like and have sex with whoever we like, there are no other rules. Other people, however, have more strict guidelines: some like to meet their partner's new date before they have sex, some reserve the ability to "veto" their partner's choice of other partners, etc. There is no one right answer here, just make sure that you talk it over with your partner and decide what is best for you, and make sure to communicate that clearly with them.

If you would like more information about open relationships and how best to go about them, you should check out /r/polyamory or /r/nonmonogamy. 




 My advice? Try to at least finish this semester. If you drop out now you'll still owe the school money, but if you stick with it you could get at least a few credit hours toward a degree if you ever decide to go back to school.

Talk to your professors. Go see them during office hours. If you're struggling with the material or just the workload, most professors are willing to work with you on it so you can still get a decent grade. Don't be afraid or intimidated - they are supposed to help you, it's their job as an educator.

Also, talk to an advisor. Most schools these days have staff for advising you on how to navigate your degree and whatnot, and it doesn't cost extra to talk to them. They might be able to help you figure out what's best for you and if college is really a good fit. They will be able to help you lay out your options and hopefully make your decision easier.

If your school has it, go to their tutoring service. People who get tutoring statically get better grades. Even honors students benefit from it, there is no shame in going. 

Lastly, if you feel lonely or that you don't fit in socially, try joining a club, volunteer organization, or intramural shorts team. There are plenty of interest groups on campuses; try to find one you like, or seems fun to try. It's a great way to meet new people who have something in common with you, and it helps break up the monotony of classes. 

Hope that helps, and good luck with whatever you decide to do, op. 




 I often have a hard time taking to people I don't know well, especially strangers, but I've found that knitting and crochet make great ice breakers. Often people will ask me what I'm making, I'll tell them all about my project, and then they'll say something like "that's so neat, I wish I knew how to do that." It really makes meeting people a lot easier, because it's already gotten the conversation going, and I know that they  admire one aspect of who I am because they have me a compliment, which gives me a nice little confidence boost. After that, I feel a lot more sure of myself, and the conversation goes pretty well. It's even better if they're a crafter too, because then we can talk about techniques and patterns and already I feel like I've made a new friend. 




 Huh. So basically the idea is they just want to sell it to adults instead of kids? Okay. TIL 




 It seems like you are really unhappy with your relationship and you want out, but you feel responsible for this guy. Don't. He is not your responsibility. He is an adult, his situation is his own fault. If you break up with him and kick him out, you are not leaving him homeless - his own immaturity and poor behavior is what got him there. Don't blame yourself for his mishandling of things. 

Any relationship where someone takes is that dependent on another is not healthy. It seems likely to me that he is very much aware of how poorly off he would be if you were no longer in the picture and he is taking advantage of your kindness. I know you love him and it your first instinct is to protect the ones you love, but you aren't doing him any favors and you're making things worse for yourself. I would suggest telling him that he needs to get a job if he doesn't already have one, and start paying his share of the bills - half of rent, gas, groceries, etc. Otherwise, he no longer gets to use your gas, eat your food, and live in your house. Because that's what he's currently doing - taking and using *your* stuff that *you* paid for. And if he won't help out financially, you can easily take legal action to kick him out. You need to make it clear to him that you are not his mother - it is not your job to do everything for him. He's an adult and he needs to act like it. He needs to quit treating you like a doormat and stop being rude and ungrateful. You deserve a partner that appreciates you and helps you out sometimes too, not someone who just takes and never gives. And if he can't be that partner, he doesn't deserve you, and the relationship is over. 




 Even if they aren't lying, though, there's still the risk that she might forget to take her pill the next day, or she loses her pills, or that she's taking other meds that interfere with it (like antibiotics for instance). Shit happens. It's better to take extra precautions. 




 What exactly is adult taste strawberry? 




 Good for you, op. Although it is certainly true that abusing other people is never okay and serial abusers almost never change, I'm really happy to see that you got help and got your shit together. I think what a lot of people don't realize is that you'll never change *unless you want to*, and sadly a lot of abusers just don't care or don't want to acknowledge their issues. I was abused physically and emotionally by family members, and the ones who did it to me will most likely never change because they refuse to admit there's a problem or blame everything on someone else (namely, me). But you we different; you had enough human decency to know what you were doing was wrong and you actually wanted to do something about it. And you worked your butt off trying to get better. So as a survivor of abuse, I just wanted to say you're damn right you should be proud. I know that therapy and working on your mental health is a long uphill battle (I also have PTSD), but you did it. You actually got better. You're managing your symptoms, and you repaired your relationship. That's a lot more than other people in your situation could ever hope to accomplish. I wish you and your fiance all the happiness, and I encourage you to continue your efforts. Good job, op! 




 That's so awful! Makes me glad I use primarily acrylic yarns. Hopefully though all the bug killing stuff and the new storage container keeps the remainder of your yarn safe! 




 I showed this to my SO, his response was "I feel like this describes our life pretty well." Guess it's time for me to make some lobsters 




 I have a similar issue with my partners; I'm a tiny person, but both of them are significantly taller than me and also tend to run hot. Their space-heater abilities are much appreciated in winter but not so much when it's 80-90 degrees outside. I usually sleep in the middle of a queen sized bed; we sometimes use a fan, and usually I'll only cuddle one of them at a time to avoid too much overheating. 




 I know. I'm just scared, I guess. Hopefully things will go at least okay, though.

We have been having many conversations like that, which I think is a step in the right direction. And yes, Andy has also been a part of the marriage/kids discussion. No details really hammered out, but we have plenty of time later on down the road. If I do have kids, it won't be for at least another five years or so.

Oh, family drama is something I seem to have no end of, lol. Having two partners to support me certainly does help though. I guess I should just focus on that - no matter how my family reacts to me being poly, I know I can count on Andy and Justin to be there for me. :)

Oh, and as for F24 ... well, to be quite frank, it probably wouldn't work out. She came out to me as bisexual a while back, so I know that it's not completely out of the question. But ever since then she's only dated guys. Not to mention that she lives in a different town an hour away. So a relationship isn't really convenient, even if she were interested. 




 Hello, all! I just wanted to vent about some things, and I don't have many people to talk to about this offline so bear with me.

Background: I (F22) am currently living with one partner (M22) who I've been with for 6 years now. In May I started dating another partner (M26). We'll call M22 Andy and M26 will be Justin.

I've posted once or twice about my relationships here before but it was a long time ago, so I'll just go ahead and recap. Andy and I are high school sweethearts. We started dating our junior year, and eventually decided to go to the same university. We lived in the same dorm buildings for the first two years, and then got an apartment together with my roommate from the dorms. The three of us get along pretty well. In the past, though, our relationship hasn't been perfect all the time. A few years back, we decided to try having an open relationship and Andy started seeing another woman. However, there were issues with honesty (especially from this other woman), and the whole thing moved way to fast for me. Our relationship suffered, but eventually we worked things out and Andy and I decided we were no longer going to have an open relationship.

A little over a year ago, I realized that I had developed feelings for another friend from high school (F24). After thinking about it for a while, I brought it up to Andy and we decided to open up our relationship again. This time, we focused on having clear communication and properly expressed boundaries, and things have gone much better. Since then, Andy has dated several other people, but I hadn't started seeing anyone until Justin.

Justin and I were getting along great, but my relationship with Andy started to suffer again. He suddenly became really anxious about me leaving him or that I didn't love him as much as Justin (even back when I'd only been dating him for a few weeks). After many long and tearful conversations, we started to come to several realizations. First, Andy and I have very different concepts of love and how to express it. Second, we wanted very different things from our open relationship - I was looking only for serious partners, while he wanted more casual dating. But slowly, we have started to come to more of an understanding about what the other person needs, and our relationship is improving again. Andy feels much less jealous of Justin and insecure about being with me, and I feel much happier and less stressed out now that I don't have to walk on eggshells around him anymore.

I'm really getting excited about the coming few weeks. This weekend, Andy and I will be going to visit friends from high school as well as his family (whom he recently told about us being poly). The following weekend, I'm going with Justin and another couple we're friends with to a Renaissance fair. Meeting us there will be my best friend, and she will get to meet Justin for the first time! It's going to be so much fun.

That aside, I am starting to get to the point where I'm introducing Justin to more and more people. His whole family and friend group knows I'm poly and I've met all of them already. I have also told most of my friends from university about Justin and poly; however, my hometown is over an hour away and most of the friends and family from back home don't know about it. Even though we've only been together a few months, Justin and I are getting very serious - we plan on all living together after I graduate this coming spring, and we have started discussing marriage and kids and whatnot. He is definitely around for the long-term, which means I will need to introduce him to my family at some point. But I'm concerned that they won't be accepting of him, especially since they all know about the previous time Andy and I tried to be in an open relationship and how poorly it went. I don't want to treat Justin like some sort of shameful secret, because he is a wonderful and important part of my life. But I also don't want to have to expose him to any potential family drama.

Thanks for reading, and any comments or advice you have are welcome.

**TL;DR:** after a rough start, my first partner and I have successfully navigated our poly relationship and I now have a second partner - things are going great in my relationships, but I'm worried that previous issues with my first relationship will cause my family to react negatively to my second partner. 




 Okay, I could MAYBE see parents acting like this if their child was 14 or 15 years old and pregnant. However, you are 20. You are working and in school - clearly you are doing something with your life. You're not just some lazy person who is leaning on their parents because they don't feel like putting forth effort. You have your shit together. Now that you happen to be pregnant, it seems like you just wanted a little bit of help or support from your parents so that you can provide the best possible home you can for your child. This leads me to believe that you're responsible, and would most likely make a good parent.

So why on earth do your parents think that this is suddenly their baby? Did you ever ask them why they keep making these assumptions? Why are they treating you like you're also a child? This makes no sense. It seems like they keep doing all this weird stuff, and then you try to correct them, and they just shout at you. That is not a healthy environment for you, or your baby.

It might be a good idea for you to sit down with your parents and ask them some of these questions. Why is it that they think they are going to adopt this baby? Why do they think you aren't capable of being a parent? Why are they overstepping these boundaries? If your parents are reasonable people, you should probably be more explicit about your expectations for them and exactly what kind of help you need.

However, if your parents continue to be unreasonable, I would definitely move out. You should start looking for other places to stay now, just in case. Do you have a close friend or other relative who would take you in until the baby is born? Are there any cheap apartments nearby? Could you possible find a roommate? You should look into this stuff sooner rather than later.

I don't know where you are from, but I know that where I live as long as you aren't found grossly negligent or incompetent (and it takes a lot of evidence for this to be proven in court), there would be no legal basis for your parents to assume they could adopt your child or name the child or anything else. You don't sound like the type of person who would be forced by the state to give up their parental rights, so if your parents start getting touchy about this, just remind them - you are in control here. You are the only one who has legal power over this child. They do not get a say - you only have to take their wishes into consideration. There is no law saying you have to name the baby what they want or have the baby live with them. 




 ......... Maybe 




 Huh. I had that exact tea set when I was a kid.  




 Exactly. That's the kind of attitude every larper should have, at least imho. It should be about making sure we all have the best experience possible.  




 Oh, that was the first official game month. Yeah, thanks for humoring me! 




 Was this back in like January or February of this year then? That's when the current chapter got started (although I think they might have tried to start an Indy chapter before, I'm not sure). I'm actually going to bring up a lot of the complaints people have in this thread to the staff when I get the chance, so any info you can give would be awesome. It might not change anything but at least I'll know who to watch out for.  




 Wow, op, that's rough. I'm really sorry your mom has been awful about your identity. However, I have to say I'm pretty impressed with you. Not only did you stand up to get when she tried to shame you for being who you are, you also took the initiative to contact your local LGBTQ organization and have tried to educate her. There are a lot of people who don't know how to respond to that sort of situation but you've got a good grasp of it. 

As far as your suicide threat, I personally don't think it was too extreme. Of course that sort of thing should never be said lightly. However, she's been completely unreasonable, and she probably needed to hear you say something that extreme to give get pause and make her examine what she's doing. That said, if you ever actually do feel suicidal, please please please seek help from someone. And I hope you stay safe and your mom eventually sees some sense.  




 It's ok to be confused about your sexual identity, especially as you're growing up and you haven't been exposed to a lot of options living in an area with little lgbt presence. To me it seems like you're a girl who enjoys crossdressing (although I wouldn't rule out the possibility of being genderfluid or otherwise non-binary), and you are emotionally attracted to people regardless of their gender, making you panromantic. You could also be somewhere on the asexual spectrum. I would take a look around /r/asexuality. 

Of course, it's up to you to decide what your identity is and what labels do or don't fit you. But don't stress it - sexuality is complex and fluid, and it's possible as you become more sexually experienced you'll change your mind. That's perfectly ok and normal. And it's also ok and normal to not know for sure sometimes. What's important is that you do what feels best for you.  




 I'd agree with that assessment. If you're a trans woman emotionally attracted to other women, whether they are trans or cis, that would make you homoromantic. Panromantic means you are attracted emotionally to all genders (like me!), but considering you haven't expressed any interest in men, people who are third gender, agender, etc., that doesn't seem to fit.  




 No, you don't identify as a man or woman. There are many people who identify as both, or neither, or something else entirely. Also people who exhibit physiological characteristics that are both "male" and "female" are referred to as intersex. And they aren't as rare as you think.
