 Sweden's efforts address a problem that all countries face. At least they are doing something head on to combat the issue of waste streams. Raising awareness about the fate of trash bring attention to the ultimate solution: not recycling, not burning trash for fuel, but rather reducing the amount of trash we produce in the first place.  














 Another troubling impact of climate change on wildlife. 



















 The $2.40 figure comes from an economic study published in the journal of Energy and Buildngs (linked here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778813007652)
This dollar value was calculated by performing a 50-year life-cycle cost analysis of white roofs versus black roofs. Regardless of cost savings, this article points out that those who are concerned about climate change "should choose white roofs, which are three times more effective than green roofs at cooling the globe." 




 This is an interesting bit of science! It certainly highlights the importance of the field of ecotoxicology and should strengthen concerns over the fate of organic pollutants in the environment. 




 Ocean reserves are extremely important for protecting endangered species and allowing fish populations to recover from over-fishing. This is important work and the vitality of marine ecosystems should not be overlooked.  









 Many ecologists use birds as an indicator species for overall ecosystem health.  If our birds are in trouble, ecosystems likely are as well, and ecosystem approaches (like the wetland restoration programs the article mentions) may lead to more success stories down the road. 




 Historically tropical diseases like Dengue moving to higher latitudes should raise concerns about other epidemiological shifts climate change may bring. 




 Not good news.  As Jarraud went on to say in his statement, "the laws of physics are non-negotiable." 




 The example of solar panels over canals in India is an interesting innovationmaybe sunny, drought-prone regions can learn from it.
