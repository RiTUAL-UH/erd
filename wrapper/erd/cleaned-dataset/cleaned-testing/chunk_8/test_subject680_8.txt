 Try lessons before ditching the clubs.  Lessons are cheaper that shelling out for new irons.  




 Where is that?  




 Similar but different...  There was a guy who was a hole behind us, but he was hitting out of our fairway, buy the green, only 150 yards away.  He was just standing there waiting for his fairway to clear or something, but he was holding us up, which was holding the guys behind us up, which was holding up his fairway...  5 minutes of us standing there yelling atamd signaling the guy, I finally hit into him (over and onto the green), and as we drive up he starts taking shit.  Closest I've ever come to kicking the shit out of someone on the course. 

When we pulled up he was like "what the fuck dude?!".  I was actually  polite at first and told him that he was in a group behind us and in our fairway, and to keep the pace of play, should of let us hit first.  His reply was "Fuck you", which is when I lost my cool and said "fuck me?! No, FUCK YOU!  Say one word and you'll catch an ass wooping, and I'll catch a case!"   Which is when he picked up his ball and walked away muttering something. 

So,  I know what it's like to lose my cool.  But when ever people hit into me, i just pick up their ball, show it to them, and throw it into the woods, water, or off into the rough.  




 Don't you wish. I own a 3 bedroom house in the burbs, have a very nice investment account, and am part owner of a successful company.  But tell yourself what ever you need to, to sleep well at night.   




 I think it's pretty great. 




 That's what makes America so great.  We're everything you want to be, and complete assholes about it.  Don't like it?  Then don't move here.  Doesn't bother me any.  




 I feel very safe, because I have police and the best military in the world, that put their lives on the line to keep me safe. And if that means killing any idiot that pulls a BB gun on two cops, then that's just fine with me.  




 And I'm saying, fuck everywhere else. This is America.  Pull a gun on anyone, cop or civilian, and that person has 100% right to out draw you and mow you down where you stand.  You become a threat, you get neutralized. Period.  Don't like it, then don't start shit, won't be shit.  




 I don't give a shit what other counties do. Here in America, police lives matter.  They put their lives on the line and have full right to put anyone down that threatens their lives.  




 Pace of play is set by group in front of you.  Failure to listen to a marshal can get you removed from the course.  




 These kinds of people are what give other enthusiasts a bad name.  




 They said in the video how bad the breaks were, yet they decided to speed through the neighborhood.  Down vote me all you want, but these kids give other enthusiasts a bad name.   




 Am I the only one that thinks these kids are dumb asses?  Why are they sinking money into that POS? And why are they driving it around when they know it has some major issues? 

If you want to tinker and tune, that's great, but don't take an unsafe, unregistered, uninsured, POS out on public roads. 




 I'd kill him.  




 I'd golf and work out.  Then I'd be the Cinderella story, of the guy who wasn't even an amateur golfer to come out of no where and qualify for the US Open, then go on to win every tournament and major, shattering every standing record. 

I'm a 15 handicap, but with 100 years of practice, I'm confident that I'd be the best in the world.  




 Sucess at begging?  Sure.  Success at running a company? No.  My company does 500,000 a month, all without KS and real customers.  




 I just threw up.  




 What type of company can't establish customers outside of KS? An unsuccessful one!  




 And that product can't be more than $2 in material. 




 Shouldn't they have put some money away from their last product launch for R D?  What type of company needs to raise funds every time they launch a new product? An unsuccessful one, that's what.  




 Why would a established company need kickstarter?   




 That kid is so dumb.  It's good to have dreams, but you have to be realistic.  Start with opening a small speed shop, and modify and tune cars.  




 Try building one car before you think you can start a whole company.  Do you have any idea how to even set up the PCM to run a fuel injection system?  How to tune it to get the best mpg and performance?  What about engine design? Do you even know the basics of engine math? 

Ford spends millions if not billions in R D. 




 Needs to be AWD, 600 hp, and get 50 mpg. 




 I agree. Wooden spoons taste like wood, not the ice cream.  




 Is Duvall still playing? I haven't heard about him in years.  




 Yes, you are reverse pivoting.  Think about pushing your hip to the left and you turn your left shoulder over your right knee. Once at the top, fire your right knee and hip, stand up, and drop your right shoulder.  




 What did I just read?  




 Yeah, not hurting the grass. If anything he's hurting himself, when that butt picks up all the fertilizer.  




 Nice! I love my ST. 




 Sounds like a first time manager who has let his limited power go to his head.  




 I have no idea.  lol 




 I've worked my game backwards, from green to tee.  Been playing 8 years now.  I started with pitching, chipping, and flop shots, but couldn't hit a long iron or driver to save my life.  I mostly focused on keeping my short game good and I shot in the upper 110's then slowly into the 90's. This winter I took some golftec lessons and focused on my irons, and in now shooting in the mid 80's to low 90's.  I want to jump into another set of lessons with my driver, but I don't want to push it too soon. But you're right, until I can find the fairway (or stay out of trouble) from the tee, I'll never be close to going as low as I want.  




 I got a golf outing with the family at the end of July in Grand Rapids. lol 




 I've read all the books and my brother is half way through the second and he keeps asking me questions.  I'm like, "Dude, do you really want me to answer that?".  lol 




 Sherman's March. I believe that's the name of a good book I've read.  




 In the books, she's not that far north, and Stanis was involved in a seige, with his whole army, and wife and child safe on the wall at another castle.  This story line has gone off the rails a bit.  




 It's not finished if he is still alive...  Broken and defeated men have still gone on to do great things.  




 I play on greens that don't look half that good and carry a 1.9 putting average.  




 After a year of playing I was still shooting in the 110-120's range.  After 7 years in now shooting in the low 90's - low 80's, depending on the course and how far my head is up my ass.  Lessons and time.  




 I worked at Firestone, the service writer recommends based on milage, I recommend based on what I see in the 13 point inspection.  I would check good, fair, bad.  I'd then show the customer the issue. I didn't hard sell anything.  




 It's ok.  A bit over priced.  My driving range is only 4 blocks from me, and they serve beer and have covered and heated bays.  But if you got a group of friends that aren't that good and want to golf, it's better to go to Top Golf, than a course.  




 Yes, but outdoors, but also covered. 




 To all the people saying the caddie doesn't matter...  How many tournaments and majors has Tiger won since he broke with his long time caddie?  Do you think Phil would give up his for anyone?  




 Driving range with targets and id chipped balls.  You play games, hit to specific targets, get points, and it tracks it all automatically.  Plus a full bar and bar food.  




 I wish this was higher. And I wish the National media/golf media would pick this up!   




 He sounds bi polar.  




 Well, I shot an 82 on Monday, and three 88's this season.  Shot in the 90's last season.  So I'm not great, not even good, but I'm improving.  Which is more than you're doing in life... 




 God, I wish.  At the very least I want to see that battle.  




 I agree.  You should fuck off.  




 No offense, but that's your problem.  Golf is NOT like riding a bike.  If you don't want to take lessons, at least buy a book and spend time at the range.  




 I knew about The Mountain, and totally forgot about the Isle.  Thanks!  




 Holy crap!  I remember these from my childhood!
