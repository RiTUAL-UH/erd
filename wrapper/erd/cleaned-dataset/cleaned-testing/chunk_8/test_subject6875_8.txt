 Hopefully this is the right place. With the announcement of fallout 4, I realized I want to be able to play newly released games again. My last actual console was the Xbox 360, and I've been squeezing by with a decent laptop for games for the last 3 or 4 years. I can run games like l4d2, but not games like dead rising 3.

To play games like fallout 4 and dead rising 3,  would it be cheaper to build a gaming PC or get a used Xbox one?
What price ranges should I expect?

 Get a used Xbox one?
