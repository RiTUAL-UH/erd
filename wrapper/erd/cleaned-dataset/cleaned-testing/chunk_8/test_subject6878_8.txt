 TL:DR Guy thinks he is the boss because he has awesome gear. I am actually the boss because I give no fucks.
I win dayz!

I was dying from this. I have yet to kill another survivor, and I don't plan on it. However, if a big-headed bandit comes rolling in, I'll do Chernarus a favor. I enjoyed your story, write more if you have any more good ones!

I have an M4A3 CCO, 21 mags, and a Ghillie Suit. I'm stocking up mags for my friends. This game sucks for 85% of the time, running back and forth, but for the other 15% it definitely delivers! 




 Temperature isn't active as far as I know, but if you swim long enough you can catch a cold apparently. You have to take antibiotics to counteract that, which are apparently quite rare.

If it makes you feel any better, I left my vehicle hidden among some trees the other day, and ran up the hill a ways to log out for the night. When I logged back in, I spawned standing in the vehicle, with a broken leg, and when I tried to move backwards I instantly died. The game has it's bugs, but I think we can still enjoy it! Just learn what the bugs are, and try to steer clear of them, like driving an ATV over a bridge. That is also apparently instant death haha 




 First of all, the pain indicator is when your character goes into shock. That wears off after 5 minutes and doesn't go away until then. Shakiness is pain which can happen from a lot of things, like a broken leg or just being hit by a zombie. Take painkillers to shop the shakes. You can be bleeding without needing painkillers, and you can be in pain without bleeding. Just make sure you're not bleeding first, then take care of everything else.

Second, vehicles are very buggy. Your tractors seem to be the worst I've heard. Buses and cars can run over fences without really taking any damage. General rule of thumb for me, if you can't fit through a town without hitting something, go around it through the grass. Good luck bru_tech 




 Listen, I understand where you're coming from, trust me, I do, but I've helped many people escape from abusive relationships, and I promise you that I'm aware of when they're occurring. I'm not blinded by love or anything. I completely believe that depression is the main difference here, and it completely derails any correlations. I can't explain it any better than this, I wish I could. 




 If she wasn't suffering from depression, I would agree, but I know she isn't trying to hurt me. And I'm not hurt because of it. I appreciate your concern though 




 I understand what you're saying, but I can tell it doesn't hurt her, it just confuses her. She seems to come around every so often and be a little more accepting but it takes time. If at any point I see that it truly hurts her, I will stop. That's the last thing I want 




 Thanks for the reply. She replies with "why?" every time I tell her. Though it's painful that she won't say it back (I swear she was going to, she basically said she loved me in different words [I love everything about you, etc.]) it's something that she needs to hear, and it's the truth. I feel it, and if it takes the rest of my life to show her she is loved, it'll be a life well spent to me. I think OP, though it may be hard, needs to look at the other side and see that if someone is in love with you, truly nothing can get in the way of that. 




 I'm the one saying "I love you," and i don't plan on stopping. Call me foolish... That's what love is I guess 




 From what I've read, seen, and experienced, it does. A friend of mine has recently been hit with depression and I've been doing a lot of research reading books and talking to professionals about it so I can learn how to help her. They all claim that it is something that can be treated.

Also, for a personal experience, both my father and sister have bipolar disorder/manic depression, which though they are not exactly the same as depression, they are similar, and both are better with medication. I know relying on medication isn't always something people are interested in, but I'm willing to bet it's better than the alternative.

Stay as positive as you can and seek professional help, they're professionals for a reason! One of my favorite proverbs: "However long the night, dawn will break."

PS - Does your username refer to the book with the bear who lost his hat? That is an awesome book! 




 Sounds more like you just have a poor sense of humor, which is quite the tragedy. If I'm easily amused that's fine, I'd rather that than the opposite. 




 Rest in peace in peace? Did I miss a joke? 




 Why is everyone complaining that this isn't his house? And why is everyone saying this joke isn't funny? Jesus people. Obviously it's not his house, any halfwit could see that he is making a joke. And if you don't like the joke go elsewhere. I laughed pretty hard at this, as did the hundreds of others who upvoted it.

Let me break it down to you why it is funny. Any typical week on Reddit (maybe any day), there is a time where there are posted about three or four successful posts that follow the same paradigm. Then, like clockwork, someone posts a joke that fits the paradigm but doesn't fit the same use of the previous posts. This guy did it flawlessly, but because he is not Trapped in Reddit or Shitty Watercolor (no offense to you guys), you guys grab your pitchforks. Calm the fuck down and just laugh and move on. Normally I would too but jesus reddit, this is just annoying by now. 









 Yeah, he just kind of shrugged it off like he was enjoying. Which he probably was, since that seems to be the only reason they do it.  




 That's the thing, I didn't even have bad ~~time~~ aim. Neither of us did. I blasted him in the face, then at his feet on my second mag while my buddy fired away at his chest. Glad to know it's not that hard to kill someone ;)

Edit: Should say bad aim, not sure what happened there. 




 You people need to stop using the term "you people." It's very unfriendly...

Hacker is just a blanket term *most* people use to describe someone cheating in any way. That's at least how I used it. Scripts count as cheating.

And I live in central US, friend lives on the west coast, and another friend lives in Japan. Finding servers we can all play on has proven to be very, very difficult.

Thanks for the advice though! I too am down with cats.  




 Admittedly, it was pretty funny hearing him stand outside the door and talk to us over proxy chat, but it wasn't so funny when he came inside. We did call out friendly over the proximity chat when he first started firing, but I guess he didn't hear it! 




 His voice was way too creepy to be Superman. And he wasn't tall enough. 




 Oh I bet! I'm going to try and get into TS more. I would love to get in a game mode like this, but I can imagine the hell that would break loose when one team would move in to capture the point.. 




 While in a populated (16 or so) room, one of my buddies got shot from the tree lines, while my other friend and I were looting a small room. We closed the doors and sat and waited, planning our escape. We do not usually kill. My buddy is a hero and I'm making my way up there. 

We didn't want to engage, we just wanted to flee. Before we open the back door to leave, we hear, "Hello? Is anyone in there?" in an eerie voice. Buddy takes a knee watching the back door with a Mk.48 and I prone watching the front with an AK-74. As soon as I see him open the door I unloaded my entire mag into his head, which was perfectly lined up with my crosshairs. He runs into the room, I reload while my friend fires the Mk.48 into his chest. As he is running back out I unload on him as he says, "Okay, I'll close your door, sorry."

Friend calls out, "Hacker, back out!" So we both Alt+F4. I know you guys don't like that, but we're not losing our survivors to a hacker. Is it most likely that this guy was a hacker since he would not die with that much lead in him? I don't really know how to identify them. 




 Haven't played it often, but the few times I played it was more of a match where the tanks drove around the field circling and constantly flanking, didn't look anything like the post. But like I said, haven't played it much yet! 




 Thanks Greeny, I'll give that a shot. Do carts stop against pressure plates? I could probably place the pressure plate where the wooden block is if it works that way.

Directions: Set a cart on the track, get in the cart, hit the switch on the top block activating powered rail, get accelerated towards a downhill slope. Is there an even simpler, less obstructive way to do this? I know it's only two blocks but it is still in the way.  




 Made me think of [this.](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1049)

Which is creepy since I just read it about 15 hours ago. 




 I get one shot by the huge cannon with Squad Flak on. It definitely helps against the regular stuff, but barely. Longer respawn would be nice.
 




 I could see it working on PC, but it's outrageous on PS3. And it will never work on rush. 




 I've only seen the A-10/Frogfoot in the games so far (I'm not a jet pilot). They do okay against it. If this helps, I've used the gunner's cannon on the helicopter, it did around 27% damage after firing probably 3 or 4 full volleys against it, not missing. It takes about 6-7 stingers to take it out.

The gunship's ability to kill everything with one hit with almost perfect accuracy is what makes it so aggravating. If the pilot is on top of things (which isn't hard to be), the pilot can kill anyone at the plants, and anyone spawning trying to take it out. 




 I'm not one to complain about Battlefield often, but the AC130 is a serious problem. Don't comment if your not going to be constructive. 

"YOUR A STUPID FAGGOT NOOB."    or
"LEARN 2 PLAY"
comments are unnecessary.

The gunship is way too powerful. The splash damage is too high. It kills people inside buildings without completely obliterating the buildings. It respawns practically immediately after it is shot down. It requires at least two Stinger carriers to effectively bring it down before it annihilates your whole team, with the explosives perk. Then you need a support gunner to fill you up as soon as you're out. That takes three men out of the battle. And it can kill you when you spawn in deployment.

It needs to be either A) Nerfed to hell, B) Completely removed from the game, or C) only allowed on certain maps/game modes with a much lower spawn frequency.

Downvote me if you have to, but I want opinions.
