 Go ahead! I was forced into it but i like how they turned out, the person taking the photo's got some awesome shots of him. 

edit- i was forced into doing the topless shots, not the photo's in general haha 




 Thanks!  









 I know this will get burried but fuck it

I wad standing in the waiting room outside of the operating room while my partner was being preped for her C section.

It was abit suddern, the baby was breached, waters had broken so she was rushed into surgery 

I was given scrubs to change into so i could go in and be with my partner, but the 10 minutes i was waiting in this hospital ward with absolutly no one around ( it was 5am) was the most scared i had ever been. I had shit going through my head at a million miles an hour. 

But once they pulled him out and i heard that tiny little cry and saw him look at me everything just washed away. No more fear, no more worries. It was just him.  




 I need this in my life.  









 I work around the corner! 




 You are either brilliant, or crazy. 

I have not decided   




 It's different... I like it 




 Buy an ohm reader before  you hurt yourself. 

Please just remove the battery and don't touch anything untill you do. Expecially  with mechanical mods as you have no way of knowing  whats happening. 

Edit: Then look up battery safety, no good knowing your resistance  if your battery can't  handle it. Maybe should  have started with that  




 Two friends and I have converted another friend of ours. He picked himself out an istick20w and a lemo. I showed him how to build and how to build for his mod and he is pretty happy with it. 

Whatever keeps him off the smokes is all that matters really :) 

If i win id reaaalllly like the atlantis sub-ohm pair.  




 An australian radio station called jjj run a punk/hardcore show on a Wednesday night playing lots of local and international acts.

 I just happened to be driving home at the time they played it.
