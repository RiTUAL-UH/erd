 ARE YOU KIDDING ME

CURSE YOU 30-MINUTE CLASS 




 Ice Climbers, Lucas, Wolf and/or Snake. 

I think Lucina negates any purpose for Roy to return (minus possible alt. costume for her or Marth if they really want to stretch it), Young Link's basically dead with Toon Link there (unless they revamp him with new weapons and/or the masks), and Pichu didn't work well as a character.

Wolf and Lucas, while they had a lot of similarities to Fox and Ness, still had major differences and lots of unique moves. Snake and Icies were just fun to play as.  




 I'm interested. 

Thank you for doing this for the community, and congrats on your test scores! 




 Dipper choosing fun over the possible apocalypse of Bill? 

Everything is different now.  




 Alright, in the case that this is legitimate (which it's looking to be):

What'd his moveset be? Besides the obvious Helicopter hair and wind-up punch ending up somewhere? 




 Honestly, what I want is to see Norman Osborn appear more in line with the Avengers' stories, and having the majority of Spider-Man's rogues gallery / supporting characters (Black Cat, Vulture, Shocker, Hydro-Man, Sandman, Tombstone and Hammerhead all seem like good options) appear on the Netflix shows. If they need to, I'd say Doc Ock, with maybe references to Spidey previously fighting Norman as the Goblin, and then sometime in the future, set up for Venom to appear, possibly with the Guardians.  




 I'LL MAKE IT THROUGH, PROVE IT TO YOU 




 Goddammit Ross... 









 I pre-ordered him and Sonic. 

I see I chose right.  




 I'd pick up Toadette, Daisy and Waluigi. 

Spike? Eh... not so much. 




 I'd be fine with either, honestly. As long as crew battles are part of Smash 4, I'm fine with it. 

While SSB4 may not have as strong a 1v1 game as Melee did, 4v4 and 2v2 are NUTS.  




 Marth, Ike, Robin and Lucina are compatible in Codename: Steam. 

AND MARTH'S GETTING RESTOCKED THIS YEAR WOO 




 Young Link and Tingle in Hyrule Warriors
Toad, Ness, Wario and Pac-Man amiibos
Splatoon
Punch-Out and Metroid Prime Trilogy on Eshop for Wii U

All I need is Mewtwo and then I'll be happy.  




 Honestly, there's a lot they could do with these figures that they haven't done. Like you said, the fact that only certain amiibos are getting used kind of stinks. I've got quite a few ideas myself that could really help push amiibos. 

Pokemon games: This is among one of the most obvious to me. You scan an amiibo in, and you get some sort of costume piece for your Trainer (Full-blown costumes even, I'd love to see a Trainer decked out like Link or ). However, if you scan a Pokemon amiibo in, you can use the amiibo as that Pokemon, with the amiibo basically working as an extra Poke Ball. It's your Pokemon that you deck out and battle with. Of course, the amount of Pokemon would be limited, they surely won't make over 600 types of Pokemon amiibos... right? 

Animal Crossing: Basically, cartridges like in the original, or costumes/furniture your character can use.
