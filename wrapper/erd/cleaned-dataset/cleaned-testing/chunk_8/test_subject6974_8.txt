 I personally find Lovecraftian horrors to be the scariest. Unknown terrors and the general idea of human insignificance.

I find slasher/jump-scare movies boring. 




 Any reality TV.

 I regurgitated my Chinese food a little. 




 Not sure the OP meant a challenge to *legality*

I see it as in a bump in the road simply hindering same-sex couples from getting married. 




 What part of "separation of church and state" do these people not understand?

Anyway - fine. Let select individuals deny same-sex couples their legal right and see how much support they lose. 




 So I've had mild aquaphobia as long as I can remember. Can't deal with water being on my face, especially my eyes and nose, it makes me really anxious and I suddenly have trouble breathing. It's strange. I have anxieties about swimming and have to really force myself to go in. I'm 30 now, and apparently my grandmother accidentally dropped me in a tub when I was a baby (2-3?). I found out from my mom when I was like 25.
