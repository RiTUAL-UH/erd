 I can't get over the cutesy style of these, the [Sniper and Scout] (http://i.imgur.com/72iIQzl.png) in the 3rd comic and the [spy] (http://i.imgur.com/o5igdcf.png) are the types of drawings I want to hug.  
  
Ninja Edit; You should publish these to Imgur instead of just hosting them there, people love drawings and comics. 




 I hope they listen to the Loch and RS complaints. Also BFB. Danger Shield too. #unnerfheavy2k15 




 Somehow a Jontron link didn't make me laugh. 




 I got banned from a server for doing that, so I went back on an alt and walked infront of players and got 2 people banned.  




 That's a garbage weapon that could have been so good but it sucks. *insert lenny here* 




 I think that's what makes people call you a scrub, the more damage you do the more salt you spill. 




 Heavy doesn't have many options for gameplay, I guess tickling people is an alternate way to play. 




 :] 




 Use this set and nobody can hate you.  
Iron Bomber.  
ScotRes.  
Pain Train.  
  
Only the Pain Train is good here but people think it sucks, there's no way somebody would get mad at this. 




 This guy is clearly Py*pro*, different type of player entirely!  
  
*Disclaimer, /u/test_subject7026 does not see Pyro as a noob class he has just played alot of pubs lately as Pyro and people yelled at him for being good* 




 Bowing down. 




 I find that using the Huntsman makes the salt pour onto the baguette faster if you know what I'm sayin'. 




 What the fuck lol 




 And that other thing is the Crossbow because who cares about fairness amirite? 




 Can you screenshot your custom folder? That shouldn't be a part of any hud.  
  
Although you could be the dude who only ever plays Vow Medic or Spy. 




 spy is noob class no explanation necessary  

Is also great 




 Scout is noob class he runs too fast  
Soldier is noob class shoot feet get kills  
pyro is noob class wm1 get kills
demo is noob class m1m2m1m2  
Heavy is noob class click get bullets  
engineer is noob class make robot get kills  
sniper is noob class click head get kills  
medic is noob class don't even kill anyone  
spy is noob class no explanation necessary  




 If a Pyro uses his Flamethrower to throw flames, it's W+M1 no skill just kill.  
  
Use right click more than left click? Too stupid to use flames so he uses airblast.  
  
Puff n Sting is 'skilless' too. Left click, right click, scroll down, left click.  
  
Reserve Shooter is considered to lack skill too.  
  
Even if you snipe with the Flare Gun you're getting yelled at for being a mindless noob.  
  
Is there anything that a Pyro can do that won't make people call him out for being bad? 




 Provision sounds awesome. 




 I don't know if anyone got the *currently* joke. I'm very proud of it though. 




 "where can i buy a sweet pirate hat for my tf2 spy cosplay"  
  
This is something I googled and I feel safe in saying I am alone on this.

 It needs a buff. It *currently* can't random crit which is a very bad stat to have, if they removed the no metal from dispensers part the weapon would be viable, it should also have Widowmaker type stats where dealing damage returns metal.  
  
If those stats got implemented then the SC would be good.  
  
^^^/s 




 I'm telling Mrs. Higglesnatch about what you two did. You're in serious trouble Prendar!  
  
Wazoo. 




 *Excuse you?* 




 How is that? Because I have a picture of an amazing player on my wall? 




 Callouts in a nutshell 




 Backstabs are instant kills on unaware classes, Amby headshots are about the same damage as a rocket, sapping.  
  
 









 A Spy giving fantastic Engineer tips? That's probably why you got downvoted. 




 Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.  
  
Demoman and Soldier and Sniper and Spy are already stronger. Also Engineer counters Scout.  
  
Haha. 




 The issue with melee fights in Counter Strike is that knives are used to run fast.  
The issue with melee fights in Call of Duty is that the only way I know to hold a knife is to use the shooty knife.  
Minecraft is either swords or bows.  
I've never played any other fighting games :[] 




 [I like how these three comments] (http://i.imgur.com/qiH6aOu.png) show that he's wrong about what he just said too.  
He talked shit about hats. Downvotes are expected here.  
He used the term 'retarded' which is an insensitive term in most cases, including and especially when it comes to hats.  
And then there's a comment with upvotes because he was correct.  
  
There are comments with ~-30 points, while the other ones have ~-5. If people truly did downvote all his posts there would be more consistent negative comments.  
  
He even asked why something was being downvoted when clearly it was because he claimed to be able to "jump into any online fps and not be a noob" and that "not everyone starts out a noob" which is one of the stupider things I've seen there.  
  
This dude clearly doesn't understand much. 




 Not even a bot, first post ever from this dude. 




 You ever hang out with Obama? 




 And everyone loves it every few weeks or so! 




 He didn't make it! How can you know about the guy without knowing that he didn't make it? 




 Did you have a stroke while typing? 




 I swear I get characters wrong every post I make.  




 Why would you want it removed? 




 Whu-what animation is this? 




 Praise be in the name of the one true god. 




 I feel bad for the guy, he is a scumbag but he's pretty cool on stream. Also he has an amazing voice that I love to hear. 




 If you killed Chell and cut off her hair maybe. 




 Pretty much any of Sniper's lines. They're all so great to hear. I just love his raspy voice. 




 Y'know what I do every morning when I wake up? I say "Yo, Merry Christmas!" and then I post NSFW content to Reddit to boost my link karma sky high. 




 Brag all you want, [I'm bragging] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440_2_3814274587) 




 No random crits really makes it trash. ^^/s 




 Uh, sure. You don't need all the punctuation marks. 




 I show them when I'm really not into going out that night, I do hang out with people all the time but sometimes I want to stay home and they'll see that I'm "Busy" with something.  
  
Also people will respect me as a player and stop with the hackusations , I got like 4 headshots and "Yo this dude is probably hacking." 




 Sometimes I get invited to social gatherings, I can show them I have 4,000 hours spent in a game and they'll be like "Woah dude uhh, maybe some other time I can see you're busy with games huh." 




 I'm starting to leave my game on overnight, I want to hit 4,000 total hours by 2016. 




 Hello, DJ.  
Thank you for contacting Steam Support.  
  
Fuck you lol.  
  
Sincerely, the dudes that made CS:GO and DOTA. 




 Wow, I am actually impressed kind of.  




 I downloaded it from 4chan I think, www.4chan.org/vp 




 meh 




 Wow great job you wrote *plan* instead of *play* you had one job and you ruined it. 




 I'm not gonna lie, I'm using this sub for link karma and boy is it working! http://i.imgur.com/rVKWz4m.png 




 [No source, but I have this version] (http://imgur.com/bwzknFe) 




 If the Blu team doesn't see you get up there then you can get an easy like 5 kills, I need to try this spot out. 




 God I love the Direct Hit. 




 [Kritzkreig BONK!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K56soYl0U1w) 




 I started playing CS:GO a few days ago...  
"Thomas are there spies here? I think I bumped one."  
"Something something Ambassador bullshit something headshotting."  
"AWPer Hand is nowhere near this good dude, Valve should buff the shit out of this."  
I think I yelled "BONUS CHICKENS" when I saw that chickens give you 1 point. 




 Can someone explain to me why no headshots is even on the CC as a downside? Aren't downsides meant to be downsides from the stock?  
Also where is the Overdose, that thing is great.  
  
  

Crusader's crossbow isn't that offensive and the bullets don't heal
all that well either.  

Let me stop you right fucking there. Medic is a Medic. Medic is a healer, not a fighter.  
You aren't meant to heal with the bolts more than the Medigun, it's for distance healing, fire it into a Soldier on low hp from a rollout and he can jump to wherever you are to get healed from the Medigun. 




 Cream Spirit is both, just get that. 




 The fact that it's a pub. 




 I want to make a joke about the dude who uses this sub named Frontier_Justice, but I have no jokes left. 




 Play MvM as like Scout or something until you get some tours under your belt. I know that I, along with most of the other MvM players would see a 0 tour Spy and tell you to go Heavy or get kicked.  
  
Spy isn't that good for MvM anyway though.
 




 Well for that Pyro to exist there needs to be a Demo who also never misses. I know the Loch is easy to hit with, but let's assume there's a pro Pyro and a pro Demo who aren't robots.  
  
The Demo shoots one pill that gets reflected, then he hits the Pyro with the second pill, then he misses the last one.  
  
Loch takes a small amount of skill to aim but that doesn't mean it always hits. Even a Scout can counter the LnL by jumping, Medic as a whole counters Loch due to overheal which doesn't seem to exist in discussion.  
  
Yes the Loch does need a nerf, no the loch is not horribly overpowered.  
  
Also it's like 2am for me so that's why my structuring for this reply is probably trash. 




 The kids found you, look out! 




 The reverse is worse. Trust me I've seen my Nazi friends die from sneaky french man too many times. 




 This is a pretty shitty rename if I'm being honest. It's also very unoriginal.  




 I'm a pretty good Pyro, I've reflected Crusader's Crossbows and Flares, Loch n Loads are very easy to reflect. I'm not even a great Pyro and I can reflect extremely fast projectiles that go faster than the Loch n Load.  
  
There are people much much better than I am who can reflect Loch pills by looking at them. 




 You have computer AIDS, remember those naughty sites you visited? They gave you computer AIDS. 




 THIS GAME IS A SACK OF SHIT!  
  
Ok cool see ya later. 




 I don't understand why people kept going into that room, there's nothing there but death. 




 I'm a fancy motherfriender. 




 Now you can't ever use that shotgun again or you'll invalidate this post. 




 [Dispensers should be close to the engineer for extra coolness though] (http://i.imgur.com/cAibBEj.png) 




 Your previous works are amazing, possibly around the 5th best I've seen on this Subreddit.  
  
If you could make a Soldier with the Direct Hit getting a sick airshot wearing an Australium Gold Ground Control, Lord Cockswain's Novelty Mutton Chops and Pipe, Deep Commitment Coldfront Curbstompers, and Lieutenant Bites.  
  
I would be extremely happy and probably scraptip you because for some reason I can't withdraw my scrap. 




 ...Dang 




 God I hope I spelt that right. My phone doesn't have auto correct and I never needed to use that word before. 




 Are you using like Windows 98? 




 It's 10/10 at what it does, 3/10 when others are introduced? 




 /r/quityourbullshit kinda 









 idk but xJaJa look cool

 Shit I used the wrong word, I meant genetically Vietnamese. To quote the dude I'm talking about 'Vietnamese you fuckass.' 




 A friend of mine was born in Vietnam, raised in NZ. He's Vietnamese.  
He is genetically a Vietnamese.  
Edit: I'm drunk, I don't have an excuse! 




 [You literally need to type 'tf2 sniper' into Google to see this in less than 3 seconds.] (http://i.imgur.com/bbCs6JY.png) 




 Clearly you don't understand how to properly play Medic, everybody knows you use the Amputator to heal the whole team you noob! ^^/s 




 Have you seen the market? It may be stable but that doesn't mean it doesn't suck. 20 ref for a key? Crazy. 




 Works like a charm if you don't use the Amby all the time.

 Heatmaker will probably take the least time out of all, maybe the Huntsman. 




 [Carl Brutananadilewski?] (http://www.gameranx.com/img/12-Dec/screen-shot-2012-12-20-at-71206-am.png) 




 Hah, joke's on you! I use all of these bar the Market Gardener and Shitty Medic, enjoy being killed in MGE daily! 




 Let me stop you at Direct Hit. First of all reflecting rockets is already extremely easy, the only time the reflecting is hard is when the Soldier is standing right infront of you, if reflecting DH rockets is so hard you're probably bad at reflecting in general.  
  
Secondly, people use it for the denial of Rocket Jumping and the Instant Kill potential on 125 HP classes. 




 Wuh- What th- 'Yes' What the hell does that mean? This isn't a Yes/No question I'm asking which one it is! What the hell are you talking about!? 




 You mean the Original or the Stock? 




 I think /r/tflewd allows fanfic, as long as it's sexy. 




 YES!  
  
Sorry, I was picturing the [Gendo Train.] (http://imgur.com/lsoomRq)  
  
Sorry. 




 Direct Hit Soldier for me, I cannot aim with The Stocket Launcher, I just can't use splash effectively. 




 What does HMB mean exactly? All I can find are workout supplements.  :[ 




 Internet fluid container? 




 [ye] (http://i.imgur.com/XMfPgVr.jpg) 




 Now that you mention it, that is pretty interesting. The same principle almost applies in pubs, people would probably be running Stock or Kritz because they are the most effective in the hands of good and bad players, but the Vaccinator is horrendously bad in a bad players hands and a good player would be using Stock/Kritz because they are more effective.  
  
Also the player they uber gains more out of those ubers I guess. 




 To be fair, if your team is good enough you shouldn't need to revive that much. 




 I discussed and used one insult at the end to drive home my point. So now allow me to retort. *Moron.* 




 Direct Hit, I got so good with it that people get mad at me for using it. Maybe if they stopped lining their Gunboats with salt and tried walking instead of jumping at me they could have used sugar instead. 




 It was an insult. I insulted you. Now here you are trying to act like you're the top dog of the internet because my insult hurt you deeply. 




 I can airshot, but only in the rhythm of the song I'm listening to. It's like walking to the beat of a song but instead of looking dumb I look awesome.
