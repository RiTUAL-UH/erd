 they are as useless as tits on a bull 




 the greens would probably try 




 i think more places are going to implement something like this people are sick of having meals ruined by screaming kids 




 can't blame them the stench of urine they often leave behind is disgusting

not to mention you often have to play dodge the syringe and goon cask in many areas they sleep 




 You're a fucking idiot

It kills the nightlife because you can't get in or move to a different pub or club if it dies out or if you want to meet up with other people

The only place you can get into is the casino and that's not a good place for a night out

 




 They were and it's destroyed Sydney's nightlife

The vast majority of people never caused a problem no matter how drunk they are it was a handful of dickheads that caused The issues

Fucking sick of this nanny state and the population that keeps supporting shit like this 




 People just don't find women's sport as entertaining as the mens..  

For me it's like watching a local team play as the quality is just not The same

Sorry but that's just the reality of the situation...  If the quality was on par with the mens it  would get more followers 




 I'm referring more to popular sports like cricket,soccer,football etc

 people might watch the womens tennis more for a perve but the quality of the matches compared to the men is no where near the same.. when some of the better female players retire i don't think the perve aspect will be enough 




 no chance it doesn't have the following to take a prime time tv spot as it's not as interesting as men's sport

why would tv stations sponsors and advertisers waste money on something that has a small following 




 no one will watch it and the reason why is not sexism or anything like that

women's sport just isn't as interesting as the men's it's like watching a local team play if you compare the two

it's the main reason why people don't watch it and because of that it doesn't attract sponsors and advertising and what not to get prime time tv spots. 




 no company would buy one imagine how much business they would lose if the truck had to recharge before making the last delivery or something 




 for it to work it would need to last longer than a few hours considering how long and far truck drivers drive each day

no company is going to buy a truck that runs out of juice in a few hours (likely in the middle of nowhere with no charging station) 




 electric trucks won't be a thing until they can go miles and miles without a charge. 

on the roads they use there are no charging stations i can't see people running out to get trucks that for years would be useless 




 that won't go over well with voters a large majority of people don't want open borders 




 nah i love seeing buffering on every video i watch 




 they need better education not scare campaigns and to make it a health issue not a criminal one

the current way just isn't working and will just get worse until they actually treat the users instead of charging them

even if they end up in jail they still have access to it because no jail in the world is drug free 




 it won't happen under any government for years too many people still think the drug war is a good idea

its why they have no fucking clue what to do about ice except the usual scare campaign ad 




 it's going to cause fights 




 so what if you just went into a shop for a second to get something and someone decides to smash your window?

can see many fights starting over this 




 hate it when people bring up politics or religion at parties it's just fucking annoying and always causes problems 




 big fucking no on playing in women's sport it's massively unfair
 




 nah they like the internet and the devices made in sweat shops to access it

give it a day or two they'll forget all about nestle 




 another thing for people to pretend to care about you'll still buy nestle products even after reading or watching the video.. they make a hell of a lot of stuff

just like you buy iphones and clothes and everything else made in sweat shops and other slave labour but you don't seem to care about that 




 i think people will now see that uber is a evil company that doesn't give a fuck about it's workers

everyone is just in a "honeymoon period" with them because they have better service than most taxis 




 it would be vandalised more by drunk passengers than taxi drivers

driverless taxis in a city at night with drunk people is a terrible idea 




 it's a recipe for disaster

too many dickheads would vandlise them puke in them smoke in them do lines in them etc 




 they really shouldn't be although i do understand it's hard to always take time off when your sick

fucking hate it though when a co-worker comes in sick makes everyone sick 




 it would be unfair to get rid of him for next year considering the car is rubbish

that would be a crap way to end his f1 career

 




 i honestly think that was a Google marketing ploy to see if there was interest in a phone like that

not long after that went viral there was suddenly an announcement that a phone like that was in the works for like a year or so already  




 The company is working on a project which could provide the key to human immortality. Teaming up with Dr. Arthur Levinson, Google are working on ways to slow down the human aging process.

overpopulation is already becoming a problem we really don't need people living a lot longer than they already are 




 good! nothing more annoying than screaming kids who often run around a restaurant because parents can't control them

if parents had tried to control the kids (took them outside to cool off or left if they didn't behave) this ban wouldn't be in place

 




 actually they often end well.. lots of people don't want meals ruined by screaming kids who often run around a restaurant because parents can't control them 




 ISIS controls a great majority of a country and is slaughtering people they are a big threat in that region

you can't compare them to a battle 2000 years ago 




 yes it would wars haven't really had a frontline in a while so even if "real armies" where attacked by a force of 600 or so terrorists it would make a footnote 




 that's not going to happen 




 happens with every boycott/controversy etc etc people pretend to care for a few days while it's trending then move on to the next thing

most people have already forgotten about Qatar 




 i find the dickhead cyclists that wear all black at night a bigger problem

i've seen some riding without a reflector on the back as well 

just asking to be run over 




 your sensitive ass is costing millions to fix the sewage system as you and others flush them down the toilet

everyone ends up paying for that one way or the other 




 why would they be paid a big amount of money when most people are not even watching it?

billions tune in for the men's world cup most people don't even know or care about the women's world cup 




 some of them think it's the tour de france in shared pathways 




 meh it's the women's world cup it's like watching a local team play if you compare it to the men's

that's why women's sport just isn't as popular as the men's 




 don't get why these idiots boast on the police facebook page they'll fucking track it

the guy looks like a retard anyway and probably won't even be trying to hide IP and what not 









 they just want to break some more laws bunch of cockroaches on wheels 




 the hate comes from the fact the guy is overhyped and seems to have a big head because of it.. people are already calling him a future world champion and what not

plus not taking the blame for the Monaco crash saying he was brake tested didn't help either 




 The black market will reform if you do that 




 if you make it hard or expensive to get it legally people will just buy them illegally  




 shit like this happens all the time doesn't matter if your homeless or not

it's the same when someone has a serious car accident.. most people just drive past maybe 1 out of ten will stop to help 




 don't be so sure about that people will walk past anyone 




 Ferrari lucked into that podium they have some work to do 




 rain expected in 15 minutes
 




 ever since Ferrari did that upgrade they have been pretty shit seems like they have gone downhill 




 missed the fucking start due to shit streams 




 hopefully to change things up

besides he's also paying $26 for the win on my betting site
