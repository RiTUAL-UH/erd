 Oh god yes 




 I peed in my best friends sink all over the dishes. I didn't tell them. 




 Do you mean mangria? Man + sangria? 




 She and everyone in their "church" are a waste of human life. 




 My dad conditioned me to say soda water. I say both coke and soda water interchangeably. I had a cousin visit from up north and it unnerved me when she said "pop". 




 Fapping at that age: pretty normal
Geting into fetishes at that age: cause for concern 




 Maybe it his only way of release because he might not be able to get any. 




 It's how the Nazis found her. She was sending tweets. 




 It was a clever trick, but he needs to realize we'll always find him. 




 I like the Joker one. Wear that. 




 People walking into a donut shop near a half marathon-*scandalous* 




 I guess EVERYONE WHO FUCKING DRAWS CARTOONS better stop drawing Asians with squinty eyes while we're at it too. 




 I thought the mixed berry looked like ground beef at first 




 It's the company name 




 What I hate is that it'll get hot in Texas and then all of the sudden a cold front decides to come on down and freeze us. 




 This is so cool! Happy for OP!!! 




 Jayden from fratmen 




 d'awwww 




 This isn't funny. It's disturbing. 




 They'd have to put fake nipples on them.  *Think about it*. 




 A repost is a repost. No one likes that shit. 




 This was on the front page already, if I'm not mistaken 




 Something a kid wrote. Calm down. Obviously can't spell. 




 My friends did that too! Because I was in a foul mood already, I didn't really dance. I don't want to so I just sat at the table wishing I had a spiked drink! I'm sorry you had such a shitty time. 




 Oh please let it be a sign from the drag goddesses. 




 I wouldn't have minded dropping the money, if it had been with a boy. I hope you enjoyed it though. My friends tried their best but I ended up going home early and raiding my parents liquor cabinet. 




 I felt out of place junior year. It was also just a tough year for me because I was dealing with all my emotions and the thought that I should kill myself, which I almost did, but I'm glad I didn't. I made senior year different for myself and I brought a better attitude with me. I still didn't go because I kept longing for someone to spend it with in a intimate way, which friends can't do. 




 My dad told me a joke about a one eyed prostitute the other day. 




 Sounds like a really great guy. I only went to prom once with friends and I didn't go my senior year. I just wanted someone to go with me, I stayed home rather than go. I love my friends but sometimes it only does so much. I didn't want just my friends, I wanted it to be special and have a date, like everyone else had, like all of my friends had. 




 Alyssa gets drop dead GORGEOUS. 




 WERK 




 There's various pictures of Detox here standing with other people at the taping of the RuPaul's drag race reunion/coronation taping they did this past week. She went head to toe and this is the coolest look I've ever seen. 




 That's the T 




 I'm sorry about that. I'm just in a fighting mood today and haven't had a smoke in a while. I'm trying to quit and it sucks! I get really on edge when I don't have cigarettes. 




 Did I say it didn't? Voguing formed out of it as a dance. I know reading came first. It's just an expression saying that reading is fundamental. I'm not saying its fundamental to the dance, or that it came from it. I know reading came first. I'm may act like an idiot sometimes, but I'm not completely stupid. 




 It's fundamental.
But vogue is a form of reading or shade. 




 Retouching? Honey, that's photoshop. 




 Yeah. They had a lot of big dreams. They came from the depths of society and it makes me feel thankful for what I do have, but I still see myself wanting to be as brave as they were in chasing after who they are through the medium they saw fit. I gained a lot of respect and pride trying to understand their lives. They made the best out of shit situations.  









 She did put it out on the front of pop culture, but she definitely took it. The thing I don't like is that I don't hear much of her crediting those who created the style. I hate that about Madonna. She takes the credit and never gives it. 




 Madonna never created it. She borrowed the style, the mentality of voguing, and adapted it to her own taste, then put it into song. It's been a crucial part of the culture there in New York long before she did anything with it. 




 Yes 




 It is. It's one of the few documentaries that I watch regularly. 




 It's from the documentary "Paris Is Burning." It's a style of dance created in gay culture and is known as voguing. 




 It's been here and on r/funny before. 




 His tits are just as good 




 I kind of like mine! "Beverly Spits" We have a cat named Spits. 




 It's cool. I was just trying to help you out there. It was just really vague. I misspelled explanation earlier and I even checked it before I posted. We all make mistakes. No big OP. 




 Sorry for sounding condescending. I was pointing out some things for OP to consider and thanks for pointing out my mistake. If I point out a mistake, I expect other people to do it for me, so apparently it happened even though I double checked before I posted that comment. Also, when did I become a large bundle of sticks? 




 Check your spelling before posting next time, and maybe give a bit more explanation as to what's in the jar instead showing it to us, and expecting us to know what's in there. 




 Bone marrow is good 




 Well I'm glad you're taking control. My parents sure didn't and I'd hate to see a kid go through the shit I did because of their weight. Grandparents are supposed to be those guys to spoil but even they should know when to stop so maybe just talk to your parents and/or in-laws about it. Packing him a healthy lunch for school might be something too. It's ok to indulge every now and again on sweets and junk but teach him that if that's all he eat, it's a very difficult road filled with many serious health complications. I know it's like I'm giving you a lecture but its all in best interest. Wish someone would've done it for me. Keep it up and best of luck! 




 You should do it more often 




 Oh god. She isn't even qualified to judge that show. I want to see a Grammy before you judge people's singing! 




 YES. 3 




 This was awful 




 Have you never cooked or experimented with brains before? If you're an executive chef (I'm only assuming that since its your sous chef) and you work at a high end place, how come you haven't ever done brains? Brains are good when prepared correctly. 




 Use it 




 The video isn't there anymore. CBS had a copyright claim and removed the video. 




 What about the fucking ouija board?? 




 Did the people in your club perform or did you have someone well known come to perform? 




 I haven't heard Alaska sing live, I was going off of the challenge they did a few weeks back really haha. Glad to hear she's better than she was led to be in the show. 




 Roxxxy is just a pageant queen to be completely honest. I feel Ru isn't looking for that anymore. Jinkx can display glamour when asked, she's funny, she can really act and sing and for me that's the total package and what a superstar is. Alaska is almost in the same boat only because she can't sing. I like Alaska's style more than Jinkx's. Roxxxy is just all beauty and no substance IMO. Jinkx and Alaska are entertainers in all respects of the word, whereas Roxxxy is look. 




 I completely agree on that. You can blame the editing all you want but I really think they didn't have much to paint her differently. Her attitude was unacceptable on this episode and I feel there is no editing to blame for it. All Roxxxy right there. 




 Who is it 




 You should watch her on Willam's Beatdown on YouTube if you haven't already watched some of the episodes before. I look forward to Drag Race on Mondays, but then I yearn for the Beatdown on Fridays! She also does makeovers on a show on the same channel (The Stylish) called Transfashionable. Courtney Act is also on Transfashionable. 




 Where was this taken? 




 It was a mistake. It got screwed up and sent it twice. 




 It's Octomom.. That's 8 different babies in there 




 That is correct. He was just the voice, he wasnt physically under the mask. 




 That is correct. He was just the voice, he wasnt physically under the mask. 




 That is correct. He was just the voice, he wasnt physically under the mask. 




 It looks like a dildo... 




 Apparently he's a water bender 




 Most of it gets put on reddit first though. This, for example, has been posted to r/cringepics a bunch of times. It's also been on r/funny. 




 He aged a total of 10 years! So inspiring! 




 god bless her beautiful girl 3 amen 




 I like her 




 I'd seriously slap her if I could
