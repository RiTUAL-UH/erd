 SSLauncher is my favorite when I want to take the time to customize it. It's gridless, the widgets can be overlapped, and it can have a banner area at the top following different rules. It takes a bit to find all the options, it's not the most user friendly. But with SSLauncher, Zooper, UCCW, and Desktop Visualizer there is literally nothing I haven't been able to come up with on my home screen. Get or make custom icons and fonts, and the sky's the limit. However, all this has a high learning curve (not Tasker high, but nothing is Tasker high) and to make what I want can take hours.  
  
I wish the home screens I posted on Google+ groups stuck after I deleted the pics from my account, some were fantastic. It's been a good while since I've been willing to put in the time to make a new one. One day I'll get into it again, just not today. 




 Yeah, I have around 20 as well, but only really watch Netflix, Plex, and Hulu Plus. I got Sling TV, but am waiting for that subscription to lapse. I really want to stay away from a $20 a month channel, kinda defeats the purpose of cordcutting. If they had more content I would watch, I might do it. 




 Oh my god, she's a freaking superhero! 




 Plex pulls them from TVDB, where contributors try to pick a scene which differentiates that episode from others. I like them, often times they remind me what that episode is about better than the title.  
I do have a thing for show and season posters being nice and matching, but episodes are fitting to me.  
That being said, I totally understand taking the time to fix up Plex. And if you're the only person who cares at all, I understand that too. :)  




 [Clocky]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B002SGEAS2/ref=mlt_B000TAS9XQ_B002SGEAS2#) was my solution.  




 No use for it. And if you are playing at night, it's kind of a "shoot me" beacon. Plus you start out with 4 slots in your jeans and that's it. 




 Well, if you're looking for variety, Buzz Launcher lets you download and share homescreens. Pretty nice if you're looking to change things up now and then. 




 **DayZ**  

I got this one when it was first offered on Steam, pre-alpha I think they called it. Tried it for about an hour, then didn't try again. Until a couple weeks ago.  

DayZ is the ultimate post-apocalyptic survival game. They try to keep it as realistic as possible, and they're doing a good job for a game that still hasn't hit beta yet.  

Perma-death - You start out with a shirt, jeans, shoes, flashlight, and battery. (Nobody doesn't throw away the flashlight and battery right from the start.) Your shirt will end up getting torn into rags to bandage yourself and stop bleeding. But not to fear, you search for bigger and better, constantly upgrading your belongings and equipment, for as long as you live. But when you die, that's it. Game over. If you're lucky and live long enough to find a tent, you can store items in it and it will stick around through server restarts (every 4 hours generally), but odds are you won't, and will lose everything you've worked for. Respawn, and you have a shirt, jeans, shoes, flashlight, and battery.  

No Rules - Seriously, no rules. This game brings out the worst in people. When you kill someone, you can even cut them up and eat them. When you're lying unconscious and can hear people talking, "hehehe We're gonna EAT you" is a rather disturbing thing to hear. People will say "Hey, friendly here. Need any food or anything? My friends are over here" to you when you're a bambi (freshly spawned player), lead you to a group of friendly guys, and shoot you in the back of the head. Trust no-one. Don't trust the guy you spawned with and have been running around scavenging and killing zombies with all afternoon. The ONLY folks I've found I can trust so far are those I meet up with on TeamSpeak. Safety in numbers is a real concern, and TeamSpeak is the only way to really communicate effectively. Outside of TeamSpeak, I've rarely encountered anyone who won't kill you just because. And everything makes noise. Drinking, eating, walking, reloading, everything. If you're hiding, you better not be doing anything at all.  

Zombies - You would think they play some sort of role, but really they're just things to avoid or get out of the way. That's it. It's all about surviving the other players, not the zombies. Although they will kill you, make no mistake about that.  

Weapons - Snipers rule the world.  If you're running, you better be  zigging and zagging, ducking and dodging. Of course, turning a corner into a shotgun isn't healthy either.

So really, the only obstacle I found in learning to play DayZ is getting past the evil of the other players. Once I accepted the fact that it's acceptable on all fronts to lie, cheat, steal, murder, cannibalize, etc. (which is kinda rare in games) the game got much better. It's all about survival. There are no goals other than to kill or be killed. And never get attached to anything, you're going to die and lose all. It's inescapable.  

Oh look, someone spawned in. Target practice has begun. 




 Yes, it gets much better. Drag yourself through the first season, and when the new Doctor shows up, you're going to love him. As with every Doctor, it takes a bit of getting used to the new one, but the stories get better, and soon there with be overlying story arcs to entire seasons. You're going to come across episodes that are fantastic. There are lots of stand-alone stories, but that's kinda what the Doctor does. He travels time and space, always popping up where he's needed. 




 lol You're going to get downvoted. But I do love Donna, and Eccleston's first season did get me excited to have a reboot. 




 I would think that watching it would be my loss. 




 They made her mouth too wide. 




 How could the show's staff not be found guilty of some felonies? 




 Loved the movie. I remember watching the ad for the first time during a super bowl and knowing I had to see it. Wasn't disappointed.  
Keanu, however, once again lacked any kind of depth in his acting. It's almost like watching Eminem act. The only movie of his that makes him seem like he can act is, in my mind, Bill and Ted's. 




 The Room  
IMDB rating - 3.5 out of 10  
Rotten Tomatoes Tamatometer - 33%  
Rotten Tomatoes Audience Score - 47 %  
This is one that has never appeared nearly interesting enough to bother watching, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.
 




 One of the most over-rated films out there. It's hardly some masterpiece, it's quite good at best. All in all, I found it a bit boring, and wouldn't watch it again. And I love to rewatch movies.

 Not quite sure what I'm looking at. Is that Snowden or something? And just, why? 




 lol I think I groaned a little... 




 I've been trying for months to delete an email account that I don't have access to anymore from my Mail app on Win 8.1. Today I dug in and read through bunches of posts in forums and finally stumbled on the answer someone posted. I've been staring at this account with the error message on it forever. It's like I've scratched an itch that's been out of reach. 

Disconnect your internet connection  
Open Mail  
Go to the corner, bring up the bar, goto settingsaccounts  
Select the account to delete  
Scroll down and there's your remove button

 




 If nothing else works, try putting them in separate folders. 




 LOL You're kidding, right? I've been trying to contact them all week. I finally got my hands on a phone number today, called and waited for 50 minutes. This phone company I called COULDN'T HEAR ME TALKING and ended up hanging up on me. Seriously. Terrible customer support. The only luck I'm having so far is through Twitter, but I still am having trouble with getting help. I think "freedompop" actually means "me and a few friends in my mom's basement." 




 I've been pointing people with questions about permissions to this post on Phandroid for years. It doesn't answer app specific questions, but it definitely expands on permission descriptions.

 Did that have a guy with a barcode on the back of his neck on the cover? 




 I know, it's crazy, I really wish I could remember exactly what causes it.  




 I had the same problem. I had to go on my computer and mess around with accounts until I finally got it. I couldn't tell what I did, just lots of fiddling around. I really don't understand exactly the links between account name and gmail account, it's just odd and difficult to figure out what causes me to log into one account or the other. Everything is settled in now, when I log into different accounts everything works, but it didn't at first, and I don't know what I did to straighten it all out. 




 That sounds promising, thanks! 




 Excellent! Thank you so much!  




 lol That was yours? To be fair, it was one of the first ones I listened to, stumbled on it just as I was getting into Secret World. If I remember right, I was in and out of it between SWC episodes, so I probably didn't jump in and binge listen like I usually do. It's on my short list of pods to listen to again. I do that when I can't remember many details. I'll be sure to shoot you an update of a better informed opinion. It had a fight on a bridge and later on in their HQ, right? And something about betrayal within the ranks?  




 Oh, you guys are reading comics? Excellent. 




 This is the first vid of yours I watched, and now I'm hopping around your other ones. This is what I imagined dayz to be. Sadly, my experience is nowhere near this yet. But some day... 




 Now that makes perfect sense. Excellent advice, thank you. 




 True, but I doubt *everybody* would be liars, killers, and thieves. 




 It's *extremely* hard to find new material to listen to, no place I've looked that lists/collects/shares podcasts/podiobooks/audiobooks has a superhero genre to search through that I've found, it's all science fiction, alternate reality, etc, just stuck in anywhere it might fit, so I have to look through pretty much everything. I'm not sure if my Google-Fu isn't up to snuff, or there just isn't much out there. Every couple of months I hunt again, and am lucky to find 1 new podcast or podiobook. Not really expecting to get anything new here, but I figured it's worth a try. Some stuff I have/am listening to...  

Worm Audiobook - My current favorite, almost caught up.  
The Secret World Chronicles - Top of the bunch, I think.  
How to Succeed in Evil - Freaking awesome.  
Playing for Keeps - Another fav, excellent story.  
The Legion of Nothing - Couldn't really love this one, dunno why.  
Other People's Heroes - Wasn't bad, liked it.  
Axiom-man - Another ok story, liked it.  

I think that's almost all of them, I may have missed some I don't remember. But, I just have to put some stuff out there that I really loved that wasn't superhero oriented...  


Anything by Scott Siglar - The king of podiobooks, freaking excellent stuff.  
7th Son series - Just awesome + a little more awesome.  
Space Casey - More like a radio serial, but I loved it.  
The Heavenfield - Took a while to get into, but well worth it.  
Trader Tales - For a story with a slower pace, this was really good.  
Heaven series - Pretty out there, pretty good.  
Black Jack Justice - From Decoder Ring Theater, there's something about the patter I can't get enough of.  

So if anything here sounds familiar to you, and you're liking the same stuff, PLEASE holler out. I listen to podiobooks/audiobooks exclusively in the car, and it's hard coming up with new stuff I really love anymore. I really love podiobooks much more, since they're written not to be read, but listened to. It changes things, imo.  

TL:DR My ears need fed, please throw me superhero audio ideas (except podcasts talking about them, I'm just looking for stories.)

edit: didn't proofread good enough 




 Why in the world would there even be a wiki entry for that? 




 The Monster at the End of This Book. I remember my dad doing the Grover voice for it, and I ended up doing it for my daughter. It was the first book she loved as well. She's eleven now, but I bet if I set it out she'd ask me to read it to her. 




 Sidenote: I know this has a bit of a rant, but thank you guys much for not blasting me for that. 




 Well, I can't agree with that. It may be perma-kill, but you get as many lives as you wish. I would think that in real life people would band together more to keep the one life they will ever get.  
Oh, wait, that's exactly how life is. :) 




 [Best tip I've gotten so far.](http://dayzdb.com/map) 




 I'm still learning the game. So far I've gotten geared up a couple of times, went looking for others to maybe get in on a team or something, and headed for Electro. So far, when I've come across others, I've tried to get the drop on them and give them a chance to be friendly. Nope. I've made 1 kill so far on a guy who came at me after I told him to be cool and I wouldn't kill him. The rest of my encounters with others have yielded zero chances to make any friends at all. I did meet a guy once who spared me on spawn once, but he was streaming Twitch so I think he probably had to. The rest of everyone I've met has either lied and said they have a group of friends we can go meet (which means follow me so we can kill you somewhere safe to loot you) or killed me outright.  
I understand this is a game with no rules, but jesus fucking christ, put SOME kind of incentive for people not to be asshats. It's like they made a game where everyone is supposed to be evil. Am I missing something? Are public servers just the wrong places to be? Or is this a game just for cowardly assholes who enjoy lying and killing anyone weaker? Is there a place off-game to find friends? Because in-game sure isn't working out for me. 




 Ah, I see. And I see there's a hive column on the server list. It all makes perfect sense now, why sometimes while server hopping I'd have previous stuff and sometimes not. 




 Thanks, I kinda thought that was what it was. How do I tell what servers belong to the same hive? 









 Meh, I know how slow a business can move on something with low priority. And it can easily be simply thrown aside. My personal forecast is that things will slow to a halt and stall out.  
So I am simply content with TF2 these days, since no other mmorpg has that CoH feel to it.  




 I've had hipster pizza in N. VA, it's$25 tops. I've had 4 star restaurant pizza in Georgetown (Wash DC), it wasn't more than $25 either. Where the hell are you? 




 So, what are they supposed to put on their cereal? 




 lol and I know I'll deserve it, I can't fault you for that.  




 [Here you go.](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=FORTIS+exoskeleton) 




 Sigh. I'm guilty of this. Not here in the midwest, but when I'm around DC I do. Anyone who navigates the beltway at rush hour knows that certain dicks will rush up 495 N in the right lane then suddenly get left to get on the 270 spur. Yeah, that's me. I just can't help it. Then when 270 is about to turn into 2 lanes and some pricks will fly up the right lane, going around folks trying to merge until hitting the very end of the lane? Me again. It's gotten that I know what lane to be in at what section of highway I'm on. I find the open spots, I don't cause people to swerve or slam brakes or anything, but I be that asshat. 




  hamplanets

TIL a horrible, derogatory term for overweight person. I love it. 




 lol I've gotten into the bad habit of asuming everyone lives in Northern VA. Richmond is a bit of a hike.  




 Just head to the district. :)  




 Where does it say the teachers filled his head with that?  




 Holy shit, what *wouldn't* confuse someone? 




 How is the existence of a god easily dis-proven? 




 Is he even asking for information about it? /r/atheism seems to get pissed when Christians (or whoever) try to tell them why their own point of view is so great, I kinda think the other way around is the same. 




 Morals don't require religion to exist.  
So no, he would be very, very far from an ideal atheism poster-boy. 









 Wow, bitter much? It's someone they care about and have always respected in the past. All would take is a pleasant-toned discussion between the two of them to get her to back off. Seems like a much better alternative than to ostracize someone who they're going to have to work with each day. Think ahead, don't burn bridges unnecessarily when they can easily be modified to work for you just as well as they ever had.
