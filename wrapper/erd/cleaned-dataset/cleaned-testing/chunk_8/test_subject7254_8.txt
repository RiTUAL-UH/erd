 More proof that Global Warming fanaticism is a religion and not a science. 




 Redistribution of wealth sounds great when you are an idealistic high school student.  However it has one practical flaw that you won't appreciate until you earn a paycheck.

To give money to someone, you must take it from someone else. 




 "environmental justice"   aka shakedown whitey. 









 One leg at a time. 




 More taxpayer-funded luxuries for our masters in Washington DC. 









 Smackdown of the anti-liberty, Green fascists. 









 Climate change!!!!!! 









 "Wahhhh it's just not fair!"

Life isn't fair kids. 




 It probably took you longer to take and post these pictures then to look for another place to put your bike. 




 Multiculturalism is a failed social experiment and the Muslim hoard will overrun Europe again.  

We will have to find another Charles Martel.

It's only a matter of time.


 




 No one is forcing anyone back to work, just like no one forces you to get pregnant.

Consequences.  They happen. 









 That's what centralized economic planning will get you. 









 Global warming!!!!! 









 Looks like [disregard for the public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzH1BF7Hd1o) runs deep in Santa Ana. 









 Yes and now Saudis are funding the construction of hundreds if not thousands of mosques across America. 




 Remember, if you tried to stop him, he would have hurt you also. 




 "Three tons of him" 









 Please don't get your political leanings from TV shows. 




 If immigrants voted predominately Republican, Democrats would not be for open borders. 














 You've summarized /r/politics perfectly. 









 Riiight.  Republicans also kick puppies and shove old people down flights of stairs. 

Journalism is dead. 




 Government employees driving the news. What could go wrong?  














 "The future does not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam."

Barrack Hussein Obama

Edit: Why would you downvote the raw text of your God? 









 This article is baloney.  The guy is counting investment income also, which is rightfully taxed at the long-term rate of 15% percent, since it has greater risk.

Complete sham meant to drive the uniformed to support class warfare and socialism.



 




 More proof that global warming fanaticism is not a science, but a political ideology. 









 Bullshit. In a civilized society you should be free from being beheaded for your beliefs. 









 Possible [eyewitness account.](https://twitter.com/alimhaider/status/606500612952326144/photo/1) 














 There is no rational reason that someone can't make it to the polls, which are usually open for 12 hours on election day, if they wish to vote.

Does it take longer than 12 hours for Democrats to travel to their neighborhood polling center?

Can you show me one documented case of someone that couldn't make it to their *neighborhood* poll in less than 12 hours of travel? 

Get up early.

Vote on your lunch break.

Vote after work. 

Vote anytime if you don't work.

Some states actually require employers to give you time off to vote!  

There is absolutely no legitimate reason for early voting.


 




 Early voting is actually a relatively new thing.  

From Wikipedia, which I have not confirmed:



History of early voting in U.S. presidential elections

Year	Early votes

2008	30.6%

2004	22%
	
2000	16%

1992	7%
 




 I don't base my stances on if something is a "terrible thing" or not.

"The Congress may determine the Time of chusing [sic] the Electors, and **the Day** on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States."" 




 Because making everyone vote on the same day is racist.   /s


Edit: The founding fathers decided on one day for elections.  This was before cars, trains, etc.  Yet one single day for elections was deemed okay. 

Ask yourself, why are the Democrats so opposed to only accepting votes on one day?  














 I bet he wasn't complaining about his paycheck. 




 Nothing is Obama's fault.  Ever.

Unless something goes right... 




 Liberals want money out of politics, provided that money is not foreign money going to the Clintons. 




 "Most transparent administration in history."

Obama's whole life has been a secret.  Why did we think his presidency would be any different? 









 Look at all that roaring water.

Climate change!!!   /s 




 They understand that money isn't created from thin air. 




 Mathematicians:
90 Democrats for every 10 Republicans.

This is simply not true.  Sorry. 









 Because possibly killing someone with a brick makes it all better. 




 "We have to pass it to find out what's in it." 




 The vilification of wealth and success by the left is driving class warfare and America's suicidal push towards socialism.  

Some people have far more money than you.  Get over it. 

Life isn't fair and it never will be.  
 




 She is welcome to walk next time. 




 "Privatizing social security"

"Social security" was private before it was public.  It used to be called being responsible and saving for your future.  Now that we've involved the federal government, this "safety net" will soon be insolvent.  

Centralized power of social programs is an abhorrence.  









 The Constitutional concept of checks and balances is considered a racist, old fashioned idea on /r/politics....until a conservative is President. 




 Hillary would never have the courage to do this. 




 Of course not.  It's just another Clinton coincidence. 




 The Constitution clearly says anyone holding office cannot accept money from a foreign state.  It's cut and dry.

If we hadn't been wiping our asses with the Constitution for the past 50 years, Hillary would already be in prison. 




 Hillary Clinton has committed crimes, but watch the stream of excuses from the Reddit Democrats. 














 So the President does or doesn't have an impact on GDP?

You attempted to prove both sides in your post, but loyally kept your lips wrapped around Obama's organ.

Grab a Kleenex. 









 Meanwhile, Obama is busy "standing with the Muslims." 














 Just like Al Gore said the polar ice caps would be gone by now.

Meanwhile he is laughing all the way to the bank. 




 Yes. They sound like assholes. 









 Climate change!! 




 Boston has a historically cold winter---- "It's a single event and doesn't disprove climate change!"

Texas has a few days of flooding----- "Climate change!!"

Edit: When science is politicized, you get sheep like those in this thread. 
























 While it's "working" in Europe, America has the most sought after universities in the world.

Why?

Hint: It has nothing to do with bureaucrats in Washington DC. 




 Here's his [Kentucky cousin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn8EQ0azXpQ) 




 You think college is expensive?

Just wait until it's "free". 




 Wahhhhh it's just not fair!!
