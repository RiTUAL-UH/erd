 about 600 feet to the end? 




 for those that aren't close do know they allow one set of campers to camp on site each night.  i think we paid $20 a person for two nights of camping and unlimited rounds.  we used their location as the hub for winter park and other activities. 




 Q39.   




 my friends and i play down under at least once a week and only bring a buzzz.  it's a lot of fun. 




 if you had landed on the fairway it would have stuck out more also. 




 conditions?  flat? no wind?  




 learn to throw it and then do yourself a favorite and get a TL. 




 agreed.  definitely grind it finer.   




 Waterworks
Kansas City, MO 




 How are the courses in the Chicago area? 




 That was not the type of history I wanted to see unfold.   




 In the KC area?  Swope Park.  Blue Valley.  Rosedale.   




 i took the water works photo sunday.  history won't begin to unfold until 7pm today.

here's a pic i took at game 4

 that's disappointing to hear.  the fairways are usually manicured quite nicely.  if you do throw off the fairway i could understand the complaint of overgrowth etc.  come back and play! 




 agreed.  i took this about 50 feet past the tee pad.
