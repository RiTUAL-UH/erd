 I'm 19 and I'm struggling with depression and anxiety and a slew of other things right now.  On the bright side, I completed my first college course today. 




 I've had it since launch and never felt the need for micro transactions.  It takes a little to get to the really powerful cars if you're just starting, but they aren't throttling you or anything. 




 I know this post is a little old and the band isn't metalcore, but my dad and I know Teppei Teranishi from Thrice.  We would take him out to dinner before every show in Colorado. 




 I bought mine from an old guy :P 




 I'm pretty sure Saabs before 2000 were pretty damn reliable. 




 Lyndon Blow Jobson 




 God, I had an SX4 for my first car and I would be all over that. 




 It's just so out there and bad that it's great! 




 It's on Netflix! 




 YouTube can have hidden links that you can only get by using a certain URL. 




 DUDE! Tokyo Drift is the best one! 




 /r/tripsit has an immediate assistance link in their sidebar.  Stay calm and try that. 




 A parachute. Because what the hell is happening that means everyone needs a parachute? 




 Someone at my old highschool drove one. Pretty interesting cars. 




 I completely agree about Zombie EP. I love their new and old stuff, but Zombie EP was the top of their game. 




 I was going to give my own answer, but you hit the nail on the head. 









 My guy had a metal plate over half his face and the the rest just had a sheet with holes for the eyes and mouth over it. He scared me. 




 My sister broke her arm one day and then only a little later, my brother hit and cut his head pretty bad. The doctors hadn't even changed shifts when my dad went the second time. It was awkward. 




 There was nothing more terrifying than having my first panic attack while in the middle lane of a highway.  




 Tokyo fucking Drift. No complaints. 




 *salute* 




 Maybe ;) 




 Thanks :). I do plan on coming back when I'm less busy. 




 I probably will. I had a lot of fun here. I just don't have time right now. 




 I'm just too busy with college right now. I saw that people are expanding into Liechtenstein and Kaliningrad and I hope they treat the territories well. I just don't have the time ontop of terrible writers block. It was really fun though and I'll probably keep lurking and if I get a less busy schedule, I may rejoin. But until then, see you all. I was here for a while and it was great the whole way.

 Subaru Baja.  Car is ugly as fuck and I want one for a project car so bad and I can't explain why. 




 My favorite movie in the series. 




 Happy fucking birthday! 




 I'm sorry to hear that. I agree that they definitely aren't the same. I enjoy them though. 




 I'm in the same boat. Matt Tobin's new band RITUAL is pretty damn good though. 




 First: 2007 Suzuki SX4 Automatic

That car has a lot of sentimental value to me and I get a little happy when I see them.

Now: 2004 Subaru WRX 5-Speed

I fucking love this car. Period. 




 It is in the same sense that anything heavier than Led Zeppelin is heavy metal and all hardcore music is screamo. Just generalizing. 




 You deserve it. It's your day! 




 Hey, dude, I know what that's like. I would send you something but I'm a poor college student. I really do hope all these great people have brightened your day though. Happy Birthday! 




 Yeah, dude! 




 University of Colorado at Colorado Springs 




 I just thought I'd give a reason. I've been getting ready and packing and stuff and moved into my dorms today. I should be posting regularly again this week. 




 My dad and I know Teppei Teranishi from Thrice. We would take him to dinner before their shows in Colorado. He's a really cool guy. 




 Meta: Oh wait, it was misspelled. Well darn. Though he hasn't posted in over two weeks. I'm gonna have to ask the mods about this. 




 Yes, we negotiated Kaliningrad from Tuva. Was Leningrad claimed? I searched for a claim post and couldn't find one. 




 Hmm, I never saw your annexation. I'm not sure how to deal with this since Kaliningrad by itself was ceded to me and I don't believe other annexations can take over someone else's. 




 Thank you. We'll accept the workers whenever it's most convenient for you. 




 Extra workers and equipment may allow us to speed up the process from three years to two years if you're willing to provide it. And of course, we will allow Poland to have control over a to be determined portion of the ports that are built as long as we are on good terms. 




 Hchste Kaiser has given the Overseer of Kaliningrad permission to begin a three year project to expand Kaliningrad's ports in order to increase trade and tourism. To put it simply, there will be more docks to accommodate more trade and tourist ships and also newer docks to hold larger ships. We will also be expanding the shipyards to increase the output of ships built in Kaliningrad. We hope that this will improve Kaliningrad's economy and allow us to connect with more countries through trade all over the world. 




 Vote 




 Seeing that the old leader that Hchste Kaiser test_subject7429 left in charge has proven inactive and unfit for duty, our great leader has decided to appoint the oldest if his 5 children to be the overseer of the most recent addition to the land of Liechtenstein, Kaliningrad. He will be taking a similar role as the Hchste Kaiser, only he will be reporting to and taking direction from his father. His job will consist of taking care of smaller legislation, overseeing the economy, and commanding the military within Kaliningrad.

 There is no sound. It's a video of the gif. 




 Yeah! I'm visiting from Colorado. 




 OH MY GAWD IM EEIN NEW YAWK 




 VOTE 




 I just landed in New York. 




 All of Kaliningrad. 




 I got lucky and found one for $80. It was more than I wanted to spend, but those were some of my favorite games. 




 I just bought a used collection of those games because I lost my discs and they don't sell them online.

 After years and years of construction, planning, and various delays, the wall around the country has finally been completed. The wall itself stands at fifty feet and the top is lined with artillery, mounted guns, and soldiers. There are several access points into the country all throughout the wall with military checkpoints. Finally Liechtenstein has the safety its citizens have always deserved. Everyone may note, that this is not a closing of the borders like last time, but simply a (extremely expensive) safety precaution. Glory to Liechtenstein!

 I don't think I've ever heard any one not refer to it as a sequel. It may be a single movie and part of a story, but by definition, it's a sequel to the first movie. 




 Even the eagle itself is slanted. I like the theory! 




 Oh my god. I could never tell that that was an eagle in his eye before. I thought it was just an imperfection in his glass eye. I feel incredibly stupid now. 




 (Sorry, quick one because I'm on vacation.)

Liechtenstein annexed Kaliningrad, Poland = mad, Poland had been trying to get Kaliningrad, Poland not good enough, Poland declare war for Kaliningrad, Liechtenstein fights alone at first, everyone joins Liechtenstein before second battle, Poland surrenders. 

Tune in next year for the usually unabridged news.

HCHSTE KAISER IS BEST KAISER! 




 I don't know why, but I fucking love that little car. 




 Ok, cool. 




 I'm not sure if being ceded Kaliningrad is an annexation, but I have that. 




 January 25th, the day the Poland conflict ended, will hereby be known as Recollection Day in remembrance for all citizens and soldiers of Liechtenstein lost in the Kaliningrad invasion and in any future conflict.  All but essential businesses such as hospitals will be closed on this day so that people may rest and remember those that selflessly fought for the freedom of others. 




 They have surrendered and continuing this conflict would only lead to more deaths for no cause at all. 




 I'll ask them to withdraw. I'll figure out what to do if any choose not to. 




 We thank each and every nation that helped us in our time of need and will repay you somehow. A peace treaty is in the works. 

(If anyone wants to help me with that, that would be cool) 




 We accept this offer and will now be taking over the safe passage check points for traders to and from Kaliningrad. Perhaps over time, that deal may be struck again.  




 We thank you for ending this before more blood was shed. 




 Liechtenstein thanks you 




 Liechtenstein was ceded Kaliningrad without knowing that Poland had been in negotiations for Kaliningrad two separate times before. They believe that the land belongs to them rightfully, I disagree. If they weren't given it two prior times, they must have been seen as unfit.

 Sorry about not having an updated wiki. I've been really busy :/ 

Like I really feel bad. 




 A bunch of people gave them warnings, South Africa is giving me some planes, but beyond that it would seem I'm the only one right now.

[Meta] Sorry I didn't get my conflict post, by the way. It was a friend's birthday. 




 Poland, I think. 




 Not at all, I was just clarifying. 




 [Meta] But I'm wondering if I should include them in my conflict post or if you're declaring war. 




 Question, are you going to be commanding them or are you loaning them to me? 




 Yessir 




 Ok, I get it.  I'm probably the marshal then. 




 So is the coordinator someone I make up? Or another player? 




 [Meta] Two questions

1: What's a battle marshal?

2: How will the defense points work because they're attacking my territory, not me directly? 




 Liechtenstein congratulates you on your coming to power! I would send you a gift if I weren't in a state of war.  Perhaps after. 




 Honestly, it's better than doing nothing at all. 




 Thanks for helping. 




 Thank you. 




 Any help is appreciated. 




 Thanks for the assistance. 




 I just feel that entering the borders against my will is kind of a war-y thing to do.
