There are a few other reactions in there that could be turned into gifs. 









 You are being downvoted because you have attempted to dismiss everyone who rightly objects to the abhorrent cruelty that pigs are commonly subjected to on contemporary farms by referring to those people as juvenile and attacking their character despite a complete lack of evidence on your part. At the same time you have failed to present any rational justification for your pro-cruelty stance.

There is no brigade, it is just a bad comment. 




 Instead of resorting to insults you could articulate why you feel your justification was valid. 




 The train of thought is bad regardless of where it is used. That includes the food question. 




 Several of the above quotes specifically mention vegan diets as being healthy for all stages of life, and the rest say "(*see context*)" suggesting that you should actually go look at the context for the quote, in which case you would see that the sources are including vegan diets as a type of vegetarian diet in their statements. 

These are the largest groups of dietary experts in the world. Some blog source that you saw once on Google of a guy saying he is a recovering vegetarian does not refute that.

Interestingly, what you are doing (rejecting scientific evidence and suggesting that people turn to inferior and unsupported sources) is also a popular strategy used by creationists. 




 We wouldn't exist today without a lot of the terrible things in the past having happened. That isn't a reason for us to continue doing terrible things today.

There is also overwhelming consensus that we can get everything we need to be healthy as vegans:

 Statistically you will hear a lot more racist comments like this in prison. Statistics are telling me to keep my children and piglets safe from people like you.

 Does [Mercy for Animals](https://www.youtube.com/user/mercyforanimals/videos) count? 




 It is because there is no singular for the word "cattle" so often the word "cow" is casually used to describe the species even though properly it only refers to females of the species. 




 I bet you also think killing humans is wrong. Why are you using electricity since air pollution kills people? And what if that paper clip you just dropped causes a hurricane to develop on the other side of the globe that kills people? You should also try talking to mountains about not crushing people in avalanches because that is wrong.

Or you could be a reasonable individual who does what is possible and practical to minimize their impact on others (human and non-human), and recognizes the fact that even though we can't do everything that shouldn't stop us from doing what we can do. 









 The top response would be:

Found the vegan! 




 No, you shouldn't forgo evidence because a child says something that contradicts it, but we can recognize that children may not yet have many of our prejudices and can lend a unique way of looking at things. 

That is what this post is intended to convey, not that children are actually infallible.  




 I predict that /u/russlemahjunk is going to suddenly care a lot less about plants than they did a few minutes ago. 




 Are you familiar with the "Hokey Pokey"? I believe it ranks up with the work of Harris and Dawkins as one of the greatest philosophical pieces of all time. 




 You did a far better job articulting counter arguments than the actual troll. Can we hire you as full-time troll for this sub? How do you feel about being a neurologist who herds sheep? 




 At least they figured out to make a new username this time. 














 Did you read the article?

Of course, I don't really believe eating meat (or not) has anything to do with masculinity. Gender rules are as limiting for society as national and racial stereotypes. The long term goal is surely to remove attachment to masculinity altogether. 






























































































 The Google Trends data shows the relative percentage of all searches that include a given term, not the absolute number of searches.  




 I'm sure they eat and enjoy protein-rich vegan foods all the time without even consciously realizing that what they are eating is vegan.  




 [Here's an essay discussing whether or not we ought to eat insects with the goal of reducing suffering in mind](http://reducing-suffering.org/why-i-dont-support-eating-insects/) 




 don't tell me ~~what~~ **who** I can and can't eat.

Animals are individuals. They are not merely things. 




 I think we are 30 years away from some major countries such as the US going vegan. We are probably still 70 years away from the majority of the world going vegan.

Google searches for vegan have increased by a factor of 2.5 in the past 5 years and /r/vegan subscribers are growing by about 0.1% per day. If either of these trends continue we are about 30 years away from a vegan world. 



















 [Here is Google Trends search info for the keyword "vegan" from the past 90 days](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=vegan geo=US date=today%203-m cmpt=q tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B4).

There is a peak every Sunday, except for one unusual peak on Tuesday, June 9th. [Here are the Google News results for the keyword "vegan" from that day](https://www.google.com/search?q=vegan es_sm=93 biw=1920 bih=971 source=lnt tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A6%2F9%2F2015%2Ccd_max%3A6%2F9%2F2015 tbm=nws).

All of the top news results are about Beyonce being *vegan*. I'm not sure what sort of impact this really has, but it attracted a lot of extra attention to veganism and I found it interesting. 
























 I don't approve of people consuming dairy and eggs either. The way animals are treated in order to produce these products is unacceptable.

Even if people don't like hearing this, that is a much smaller concern than the need for this message to be heard. 




 [Farm to Fridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THIODWTqx5E) and [What Came Before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNxcylWLEH8) are both good options. 




 This isn't in my part of the world, but one group that I follow is [Sentience Politics](https://www.facebook.com/SentiencePolitics?fref=ts) 









 Male chickens do not lay eggs, and the males of the egg laying variety do not grow fast enough to be worth raising for meat either. These chickens are commonly ground up alive [as can be seen in this short video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huVJDWaKrxM) or explained in more detail [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN0g13kMk6s). Some other places may simply throw the birds into large trash bags to suffocate.

The hens themselves frequently live in terrible conditions even in facilities that try to advertise themselves as being more humane. [Here are pictures of free-range, cage-free, and organic egg laying operations](http://imgur.com/a/fp7C0). Even on the nicest farms though, the hens' egg production begins to drop off after a couple years of age and they will be sent to slaughter. There is no economic way to let these animals live out their entire lives. [Here is a picture showing how old various animals usually are when slaughtered](http://i.imgur.com/LLyM10R.jpg). 









 [Final Result](http://i.imgur.com/rZ6fTC0.jpg)

**Ingredients**

* 2 garlic heads/bulbs, top quarter cut off to expose cloves
* 6 tbsp + 1 tsp olive oil
* pinch of fresh thyme leaves (optional)
* 1 head cauliflower (2 pounds)
* salt + pepper
* 2 tbsp lemon juice, plus extra
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, or to taste
* 1 pound brown rice pasta, such as penne or fusilli 
* 2-3 handfuls baby arugula
* 1/4 cup walnut halves, toasted + chopped

**Directions** 

Adjust an oven rack to the middle position, place a naked baking sheet on the rack and preheat to 500 degrees F. Tear two squares of aluminum foil and place cut garlic heads in the centers. Drizzle exposed garlic tops with 1/2 tsp olive oil each. Season with salt, pepper, and thyme leaves (if using). Wrap garlic bulbs up securely and place in the oven. Roast until garlic is browned and mushy/tender, about 40 minutes.

While garlic is roasting, trim the cauliflower leaves and the extra bit of stalk at the bottom. Cut the head right down the middle, from top to bottom. From there, cut each half into 4 wedges. In a medium bowl, toss the cauliflower wedges with 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, and pepper. Remove the pre-heated baking sheet from the oven and carefully lay the cauliflower wedges onto the surface, leaving some space around each piece. You should hear sizzling. Roast cauliflower until tender and well-browned, about 25 minutes (I flipped mine halfway).

Once slightly cooled, transfer cauliflower to a cutting board and cut into bite-size pieces. Unwrap roasted garlic and squeeze cloves out into a small bowl. Mash roasted garlic with a fork to make a smooth puree. Whisk in the lemon juice, pepper flakes, some salt + pepper, and 1/4 cup of olive oil. Set aside.

Cook brown rice pasta according to package directions with a fat pinch of salt in the water. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining. Once drained, return cooked pasta to the pot. Add chopped cauliflower, garlic sauce, arugula, extra lemon juice to taste, and 1/4 cup reserved cooking water. Add more cooking water as necessary to achieve desired consistency. Serve pasta with handfuls of chopped walnuts on top and extra chili flakes.

 Classification of specific foods as good or bad is overly simplistic and can foster unhealthy eating behaviors.

 OKCupid lets you search by diet (including vegan) for free! 




 My favorite restaurants in the area that meet your criteria are Cha-Ya and Herbivore. 




 There are a bunch of other vegan bands doing the Warped Tour too. I had trouble keeping track of all of them. I met Silverstein back in 2013 when they did a signing at our table. I got to talk to a lot of band members who were vegan this time around, but I didn't keep close track of what bands they were with. 




 Is your point that when people act in ways that harm others they may be criticized for it? 














 I don't think I have any innate gifts for activism. I think I have succeeded and improved because I have sought out information on how to be an effective activist, and I have practiced regularly and tried lots of different things.

5. If grilling the burgers, grill over medium heat and rub a little bit of olive oil on the grill to ensure that the burgers don't stick.

6. Top veggie burgers with curry cilantro mayo and enjoy on a bun with toppings of your choice! 






















































 I very much prefer my bed at home. Sleeping somewhere that is 90 degrees, not filled with the sounds of rattling and clanking metal, and where I don't bounce up and down from the potholes in the road seems better to me for some strange reason. 




 Some of my least favorite experiences aren't with people trying to be rude, but people who feel hot and decide that it is okay to sit down right next to or even in front of our tables to get shade. I hate having to shoo these people away and seem like the mean vegan even though it clearly isn't appropriate to just plop themselves down directly in front of our tables.

Along those lines there were some girls at the Houston, Texas show who had brought hula hoops to the event and were doing some artistic/acrobatic hula hoop twirling that for some reason they decided to do right next to our tables. After a couple minutes of this, we pointed out to them that people couldn't come up to the table because they didn't want to interfere with their hula hooping and we asked them to choose another spot for what they were doing. 

One of the girls flipped out at this, she walked about 20 feet away, but then turned back and started shouting things like "Hey, I don't see anyone at your table! Nobody wants to go up to you guys anyway!" We mostly ignored her and after a couple minutes she left, but came back later in the day to complain a bit more. It was one of the most immature things I had ever seen. 




 I first got interest in my club by putting up fliers that had little pull off tabs with my contact info around campus. The school also had a club day where students would go around to tables to find out about on campus clubs. I had a sign up sheet for people to provide us with their e-mail addresses and that's where most interested people signed up.

The core people involved in my club were interested in spreading animal rights, but many more people were only interested in tasty vegan food. I'm not a great cook, but I hosted a lot of vegan potlucks as club events. 

My club also did a lot of tabling on campus. I had inherited a lot of stickers that were printed by PETA from a previous animal rights group on campus that had died out a couple years before I started mine. I was also able to make pins/buttons for free using a button maker that the campus had, so we passed these things out for free. If you can't figure out how to get anything like this to pass out for free, you can print stickers super cheap [here](http://www.printrunner.com/cut-to-size-sticker-printing.html) as long as you are printing a large quantity. Passing out a free sticker with a piece of literature can help you reach more people, and anything that you offer for free can bring a lot more people up to your table for a conversation.

Planning a trip to an animal sanctuary, inviting club members to join you for leafleting, holding a movie screening, and [doing a vegan food sampling](http://www.vegfund.org/food-sampling-intro.html) are other good events for on-campus clubs. Assume at first that you will need to be the one taking the initiative to plan these things, but hopefully after a few events you will empower more people to feel comfortable taking the reins on their own. 




 Thank you! 




 I think the easiest and one of the more effective ways to engage in activism is leafleting. You can very easily get booklets from [Vegan Outreach](http://veganoutreach.org/order-form/) or [Mercy For Animals](http://store.mercyforanimals.org/details.php?productId=41) that you can pass out at a college campus or local event (I have leafleted at concerts, farmers markets, and a Fourth of July parade). 

Other options include getting involved with the [10 Billion Lives Tour](http://www.10billiontour.org/volunteer) or [writing letters to the editor for a local paper](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/action-center#letters). While there are some opportunities to volunteer with larger groups such as [The Humane League](http://www.thehumaneleague.com/get-involved/) I think our movement could really benefit from more people taking the initiative to go out and get involved in something they plan on their own even if it is as simple as leafleting a local college campus. 

Finally, don't hesitate to use the internet as a way to reach a lot of people. Online activism, to the extent that it successfully reaches people is just as valuable as similarly effective real-world activism. 




 Yeah, you were the guy I remembered. It was really nice getting to meet you! 




 I remember a guy who asked me and one of the daily volunteers what our favorite stickers were who was at the table for a while. There were also a couple other people who took a while to pick out stickers, but I would need to see a picture to remind me of what they looked like. 




 I don't get paid for any of my activism. I have a full time job working for a company that administers health insurance and pension plans. I'm responsible for reviewing the agreements that come in and setting up our computer system to handle as much of administering the benefits as possible. I also manage a small group of people doing similar work, and I do a lot of work manipulating large amounts of data using Excel (I'm very good at programming Macros in VBA, so the company relies upon me for that).

I know it seems like a lot, but I still have time for normal hobbies too. I play on a soccer team, run/compete in /r/SummerScavengerHunt, and I go hiking most weekends. The nice thing about posting things on reddit is that I can do it while lying on the couch watching Netflix after work. 




 Yeah, I was at the San Antonio show. Did you see me there? 

[This is me](http://i.imgur.com/yeY1gtJ.jpg) 




 I hadn't seen that picture yet, but I do see a bit of myself hidden in the background there. 

The issue of swallowing is a very controversial vegan matter. Personally, I prefer to just let foods gradually slide down my throat instead of swallowing them. :P

As far as activism goes, I think we should try to engage in some activism that pushes us outside of our normal comfort zone. In one of my other comments I described one of our volunteers who was incredibly reluctant to leaflet at first, but after seeing me do it and slowly wading into it herself, she was able to pass out quite a few leaflets. 

There are lots of other things that people can do without having to talk to many people face to face though. Action For Animals puts out a lot of their literature in vegan/vegetarian friendly restaurants, and they are often looking for people who will help deliver this literature to local restaurants. Mercy for Animals also recommends writing letters to the editor as something that people can do. [Here is their guide on how to do it](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/action-center#letters). Another thing we can all do is engage in online activism by submitting content to Facebook or reddit, or commenting on reddit threads discussing animal issues.  




 The admins haven't ever submitted content to /r/vegancirclejerk! Why aren't the admins providing us with more assistance? Firing Victoria is clearly the straw that broke the camel's back, and that doesn't sound very vegan.

If /r/vegancirclejerk goes dark then those admins will finally have to pay attention to us! 




 I have been using test_subject7471 (with an L) since long before I started using reddit. Back in the late 1990s/early 2000s I was using AIM (AOL instant messenger) quite a bit, and I created several alt usernames for myself on there. One of them included Infinity as part of the username. Over the next couple years I started using similar usernames for other sites and it eventually morphed into the current version. There isn't any particular deeper meaning I have associated with it, it is just the handle I have become accustomed to using on the internet. 

If you do a Google search for test_subject7471, only about 20% if the profiles that come up are mine though. 




 I think /u/squeek502's answer is probably more reassuring than anything I can say. He came out to one of the shows and helped out all day. We distributed a record amount of literature that day (more than Action For Animals had ever gotten out at any single event in the past). 

In my experience people are much more receptive to leaflets than anyone would expect. When you walk up to people 65% will take a leaflet and say "thank you", 33% will politely turn you down, 1% will say "I like meat", and 1% will be curious and will ask a couple more questions about the information you're distributing.

I have passed out about 50,000 leaflets throughout all of my activism. Never have I had anyone attack me personally, and for every discouraging comment I have had many more positive ones. My experiences with outreach have always been rewarding overall and left me feeling very good at the end of the day. 




 test_subject7471 (my username starts with a lower case L). There is another user with the username infinity who I think is starting to get tired of all the username mentions they get that are intended for me. 




 [I also see comments like these](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/3aj2ex/i_just_wanted_to_remind_utest_subject7471_how_much_we/) and it makes me never want to stop. 

It is a bit tough when people are degrading or when people simply don't seem to get the point despite all my best efforts, but I try not to take it too personally when people are rude on the internet. Overall, my experiences with animal rights activism have been much more positive than negative. 




 People were very receptive everywhere we went. I do notice small differences between shows. The people attending the show in Oklahoma City tended to be notably heavier than people in other cities, and Houston had the most people who said "I like meat" and walked off when offered some information. The biggest difference was how hot and humid it got after we left California. Mesa, Arizona was 114 degrees while we were there and Texas and Oklahoma shows were near 100 degrees with very high humidity. It made keeping our energy up a lot harder, but I still did my best to put on a big smile and shout at every kid walking by our table (it is very loud so shouting is the only way to be heard). 

Overall though, everywhere we go people tend to be supportive and receptive, and the large majority of our conversations are positive. 




 I am very much an introvert myself. I would normally avoid big concerts like this because I generally don't enjoy things with large groups of people. That said, I have largely overcome my shyness that I had before going vegan, so I can confidently approach people and start a conversation, even if I wouldn't go to these events for fun.

One of our daily volunteers was terrified of leafleting at first. I asked her to at least come out with me to leaflet the line. At first she hid behind a tree and watched me handing leaflets to people. Then I talked her into stepping out a bit more, and finally got her to hold some leaflets and offer them to the people next to the people I had already approached and handed leaflets to. Within an hour or so she was walking up to people more or less on her own and handing them leaflets. 

[Vegan Outreach](http://veganoutreach.org/contact/) does a lot of leafleting at events and college campuses. If you contact them, they will be happy to let you know when an experienced leafleter will be in your area and how you can get involved with helping them. 

[Mercy for Animals](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/get-involved) has several ideas for ways people can get involved on their website. Another easy way to get involved is with [FARM's 10 Billion Lives Tour](http://www.10billiontour.org/volunteer) (paying people to watch a 4 minute video on factory farming). 

In addition to real world activism, we can all share things online that can reach huge numbers of people with a pro-animal rights message. [Here is a resource where you can quickly see where people are mentioning the word "vegan" on reddit](http://metareddit.com/monitor/PGfXV/vegan/). You can also find content that helps promote animal rights and help submit it to other subreddits. 




 You are correct. I spent 5 weeks volunteering at Warped Tour a couple years ago, and I have passed out 20,000 booklets with Vegan Outreach too. My first activism experiences were back when I was running an animal rights club in college. 




 I see an important role for both within the animal rights movement. People are more charitable when talking to someone face to face that they can see and identify with. We can pick up on social cues that may not be available online and better tailor our responses to people.

Online we have the advantage of being able to cite sources, and have our comments or posts seen by a much wider audience. [Here is a link that I posted the day I left on my trip](http://imgur.com/nsFUwJ1). It has been viewed 3.1 million times. I could never reach that many people in person, but online I have been able to post share several items a month that get over a million views. These images can't replace a full conversation with someone, but they have absolutely succeeded in starting many conversations and giving many people a slight nudge in the direction of veganism. 

If I was choosing which area I think we can make a larger impact with the same amount of effort, I would say online activism, if done well, is a better use of most people's efforts at this time. 




 A lot of people came up to the table saying they were interested in going vegan and asked us for tips on how to do that. So, by being there I think there is a good chance that we got them to take the final leap, but I hardly count that as a conversion. 

When we got people to approach the table I would generally start by asking them if they were vegan, vegetarian, or just interested (I phrased it this way because it seems like I am giving them a choice, but no matter what they answer it sounds like they are on the side of cutting back on animal products). If people said "just interested" I would encourage them to give up more animal products and consider going vegetarian. If they said they were vegetarian then I would push them toward veganism by saying something like.

Have you ever considered moving toward veganism? I'm sure you're aware that the conditions for egg laying hens and dairy cows are every bit as terrible as for animals raised for meat. I totally get that going vegan can seem daunting, I was very hesitant myself to make the switch at first. It means cutting out all these foods from your diet, and you don't know what is going to replace them yet. I've been vegan for seven years and now I just go to the supermarket like anyone else and pick up the foods I like, as anyone else would, but when I was first making the change it was definitely more difficult. 

One thing we recommend to people is to consider committing to cutting out all animal products from your diet 1-2 days a week. That way you can start finding new foods and alternatives that you enjoy and from there it becomes much easier to do 3,4,5 days a week after that!

The conversation varied a bit from person to person (they would usually give some of their own feedback in between my comments). I think the approach I used was very effective (I could tell people responded very positively to it), but because I didn't ever say to go outright vegan right away I didn't hear many people say they were going to do that.  




 It isn't PETA that you are harming. It is the birds who are being harmed. 




 [Here are some pictures showing what our outreach looked like at a typical show](http://imgur.com/a/Cqay4). We also leafleted the line every morning before each show. On a typical day we distributed 3,000-5,000 pieces of literature, engaged in a couple hundred conversations, and raised between $800 and $2,000 for the non-profit Action for Animals. Several other redditors came for a day to help volunteer with us (I'll let them decide if they want to expose themselves). I had a lot of people tell me that they went vegetarian or vegan from something they had heard/read/seen at a prior year's Warped Tour show. 

One thing I noticed is that for many of our volunteers this was their first time engaging in any activism. They all did a great job, and their talents, if applied effectively, could spare the lives of hundreds of thousands even millions of animals. If you have any questions about getting involved in animal rights activism, please ask!

I'm happy to answer any other questions you have too. AMA! 






































































































































 One of the top redditors (1,000,000 karma) who mods some of the default subs said this in /r/centuryclub:

We don't know the details of her removal, and frankly, shouldn't. Encouraging tamper tantrums by blacking out subreddits is tantamount to the tamper tantrum the users threw when FPH occurred. 

/u/chooter was incredible in every instance of my interactions with her, but that still doesn't mean I should know why she was let go from her position or that I should make a hissy fit about something I don't know anything about.

I do believe the reddit staff handled the timing poorly, but that doesn't change the sentiment in any way.

Reddit is a community that we all enjoy. By tanking this site we are also losing out.

The people who run reddit (admins) do have some responsibilities to the community, but reddit is a site designed to make it up to us as users to provide the content that we enjoy, independent of assistance from the admins. 

I can see the value in some protest to voice the concerns of the community, but by now those concerns have been heard. The admins undoubtedly think this is very serious. It is time to open up subreddits again so that the protest doesn't unnecessarily continue to inconvenience us (the users). 









 We all lose out on this community that we enjoy. 




 Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis. 




 [Here is my answer from another thread that applies pretty well to your question](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/39u2s7/vegetarian_here_trying_to_understand_the_logic/cs6gi0o).
