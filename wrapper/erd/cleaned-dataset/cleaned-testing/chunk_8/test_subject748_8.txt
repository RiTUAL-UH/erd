 Interesting. Should there be an activator or some sort of device to control who's in charge, like the Firestorm Matrix? 




 I like the idea of Firestorm, but I'm not sure how I could make the two be separate beings combined into one when one is a basically a god. I like the idea for Ziz being really fuzzy on terms of mortality and Eli beginning to lose it when Ziz starts to get to him. I could see Ziz hijacking Eli's body to try human things like eat ice cream or something. 




 He can fly at supersonic speeds, sonic screech, enhanced reflexes, strength and senses. Later on, with Ziz actually in control of Eli's body, they can pull off bigger feats like generating a massive hurricane, becoming a massive Gryphon that blots out the sun and being powerful enough to punch out other beings of similar power.  




 Hey Redditors,

I've been working on a science fiction series set in a universe where humanity has left Earth to colonize other planets run by Mega Corperations. To make a long story short, the central character, Eli,  gets the soul of Ziz, the primordial monster of the sky, infused with his, linking them. Now I plan for Eli to be able to use Ziz's powers to fight various villians and stuff, but that's not the problem. I was wondering how I could work the two characters being in one body. Any suggestions?  




 Hey Redditors,
What is death like or viewed in your world? What about ceremonies or funerals? 




 I imagine it would be barely hidden evil when they're around. Like someone struggling to remain human long enough to get things done before leaving to their home dimension. I don't want it to be like Wolf Ram and Hart from Angel. However, since it's a cyberpunk world, I might be able to spin it to make it something unique.  




 Drama/horror. The protagonist is trying to find out what it was that killed his parents and trying to stop the rise of the Fair Folk, who are depicted as a creepily organized corporation who is funded by a Lovecraftian horror.  




 The protagonist doesn't randomly have the ability to see the supernatural, he's always had this ability. There's an entire pseudo army of people with this ability who act as a form of law enforcement in the supernatural world. He's dodging them because the fact that he was raised by werewolves is illegal. By law, he should've been given over to the human authorities, but the werewolves took him in.  
I like the idea of luck being spent, but it should run out over time and be unreliable to a degree. Luck can only get you so far before it runs out. 

Most crime syndicates in-universe are run by major monsters, like a group of hit-men being run by Minotaurs or a drug kingpin being ran by a goblin. They generally don't like each other, hence turf-wars. Vampires and other 'higher' creatures run Megacorperations to fund their particular eating habits. 

When it comes to magic, monsters know about it and use it for utility reasons, while some humans know and use it for various reasons. The thing is, there is ALWAYS a price with magic. The protagonist has the power to see the supernatural for example, but he has really bad luck to compensate for that. His human friend in high school used magic to cure her mother of cancer, but the spell killed her father as payment. The general rule is, 'magic will, at the end of the day, bend you over and fuck you in the ass.'     




 The protagonist isn't a werewolf or anything remotly supernatural. He's just a normal human who was adopted and raised by werewolves and can see the paranormal.    




 Basicly, the monsters and creatures wear special jewelry that puts them in human form. Like a dragon wears a pin that makes him human or a gorgon wears a necklace that makes her monstrous attribues less noticeable. It's basically a glamour.    




 Hey Redditors,

I'm thinking about working on an urban fantasy series this summer, to get some ideas off my chest. The plot is about a college Freshman who discovers that he can see the supernatural around him. He's like a 'muggle best friend' of a werewolf and ghost, who go out and battle monsters in human form. It's still in the rough stages, but this is where y'all come in. You guys can throw out ideas and suggestions for the series.

 Edit- Sorry, I was going through my notes and the protagonist is going to become the next Grim Reaper, sorry I missed that. 




 Great power for a villain or anti hero. I could see the user blitzing around, faster than the eye could register, taking out rooms of guards, pummling people into submission or killing an entire town with horrifying procession. I think a weakness would be if you managed to drug the person, so that their power wouldn't work quite right and they'd mess up. 




 Do you mean like duplicates or two minds merged into one body, a la Firestorm?
 




 I already have a sci fi world with elemental and non-traditional element control as a basis for the world, I'm trying to stay away from elemental powers as much as I can. But interesting ideas! 




 It depends. Often times the individual is born with their power active, but other times, like with Bren, it has to be activated through times of stress, like Metahumans in DC comics.  




 Bren has no powers at first as it seems. He's the child of a male Wulder and a powered woman (prostitute), but later on, he discovers that his power is to transform into a giant bear-like creature.  

  




 I think it's a mix of a Rank system and a Effect based system. The aforementioned Rat-Man's power would be able to counter almost any power depending on how he used it. But against some powers, by the virtue of being more powerful, like telekinesis or pyrokenesis would be able to kick his butt or kill him.    




 At the lowest level, the powers consist of simple powers like talking to plants or small animals. Middle level powers would be something like optic blasts, cryokinesis, invisibility ect. High level and dangerous powers would be a speedy healing factor, vibration emissions, superhuman strength, invulnerability, super speed, reality warping and teleportation. Most people would be fighting on level one or two as level threes would either be in hiding or arrested for the safety of others.  




 Hey Redditors, 

I've begun working on a story set in a fantasy world where magic and magical creatures have been (explosively) introduced in a wave of altering particles. Some people begin to develop magic abilities in a manner similar to superpowers in the wake of this explosion and the influx of creatures means that monster slaying has become a profession. (edit) Before the explosion, there were some people with the ability to transform into an animal at will. This ability isn't magical in nature, and no one really knows how people can do this. The shape shifters (known as 'Wulders' by normal people) are now in direct competion as heroes and adventurers as Powered people begin to rise.   




 Hey Redditors, Fall semester ended with me failing my History class. Mom wasn't too happy and said that if I failed another class, school wouldn't be an option for me anymore. I'm a decent writer, so with time I could support myself, but I just need some help with how to break it to her that I failed my Government Course this semester, and on what I can do next.  




 I have a goof amount of things taken from other works and applied to new stories and places.

-Pantaria is heavily inspired by my year playing WOW, Dungeons and Dragons with the adventurer's being a important faction in the world. The humor, fantasy races, weird Mageocracy and comedic sociopathy of various characters was inspired by the late Terry Prachett. 

Faria- Faria was designed in a manner similar to Xanth, where people are born with either a power or are shapeshifter's limited to one animal form. The entire concept of social status based on powers are from The Inhuman's of Marvel Comics. 

The newest unnamed world where magic is suddenly released into a fantasy world is similar to CW's Flash, with the particle accelerator. The Shieldmen are like a mix of S.H.I.E.L.D and Night's Watch, but instead of containing anomalites, they slay them and get orphans to act as squires and eventually rise to the status of Shieldmen.    




 And now a word from our sponsor. 

Tired of having your kids nag and whine every summer? Do their demands for ice cream and video games wear your to the bone?

 Like a sonic caw? 




 It was my anxiety. It's been getting bad, but this semester it was really bad. I studied, but I was so worried that I would fail and have to forfit my dream of being a teacher that it became harder and harder to keep focused. I also didn't speak up when my parents suggested that I take a math course alongside a Government course. The stress from the Math class effected my ability to do well in the other course.  




 I was going for a degree in English, but now I won't have any support in terms of school. 




 But you wound up with thorn skin and future-vision.  









 So you'd be a double robot? 




 Hey Redditors, 
I just finished Agents of Shield season 2, and just wondered, what would people most likely get after undergoing the transformation? No powers are off limits!

(edit- to make this more fun, you must get some sort of deformity or odd trait) 




 So you can never have sex without giving your partner cancer?  




 Self explanatory.  




 Hey fellow Washers of Dishes! Just for fun, anyone want to discuss how they got into this illustrious field and where they hope to go in the future? 




 Here's a tip- Monster Energy Drinks and some smooth jazz.
