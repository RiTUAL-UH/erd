 Dispensaries, sex shops, smoke shops, hookah bars  




 That's awesome!!! :) I'd be interested in the link to your shop!  




 These look like something you would get from Omerica Organic...Did you customize or actually make them out of wood? Just curious! If you made them they're really gorgeous high quality work and I'm impressed.  




 Your hair looks like cotton candy miss! And I like it! :) 




 Good places to eat/sight see around the Monaco hotel downtown? I'm not 21 and I'm a tourist...Help please! I'm pretty sad I can't drink or 'anything ;)' while I'm here... 




 This ^,  and if you like double flares and not the hassle of getting them in I'd recommend trying different materials like silicone and getting df plugs in any other material that have less of a flare... Some can certainly have even more than a mm flare and even that much at 2g would be near impossible... For anyone with tight skin. 




 Not electronic but Neko Case! 









 Toilet paper, wood, cigarettes, prescription medications, money, credit cards...The list goes on and it is debatable which would cause more uproar. 




 Que the riot scene about this very thing from Wentworth, am I right? I guess this comment is more for people who watch the show but yeah...This scenario in a prison setting. 




 Well, when a female porn star has her period yeah. She would want to stay home and watch Ellen(or Netflix) with chocolate...They're people too. Porn would get tiring.  




 That we all say eh, know everyone else in our country, and live in igloos...Don't even need to guess do you?

Because they're all super untrue and they annoy me... 




 I have some pretty good ones: side/rib tattoo for 4.5 hours, laparoscopy surgery, and living with endo for years.  




 Blue Oyster Cult - Don't fear the reaper...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUO_5EALZoM

I know its cliche 




 What I like:

* My long eyelashes
* My slightly ginger hair
* Tattoos
* stretched ears
* My bum
* My boobs
* In love with my micro dermals, in the tragus area

What I don't like:

* My stomach I have flab and I used to be fit and flat stomached while eating whatever I wanted
* Teeth, front two are crooked
* Brows, on the thin side and light because part ginger
* Height and weight, 5'1 and 137 lbs
* Stretch marks
* Scars
* I have a really short tongue, I can barely stick it out
* Skin - pale and eczema
* Fine bone straight hair - I want dreads so...... 




 I think if you added a few more stars to the bottom it would make it more American but I'm a Canadian so what do I know :P 




 Wow, this is a whole other level of stupidity all of its own. I can't even believe someone could be that dumb and ignorant over 5 damn cents!  









 This is really different than anything else LOG I've ever heard especially at the beginning but I still really enjoy it!  




 Even using a leave in spray conditioner should solve this issue as well as brushing more regularly...Also, any shampoo with lots of chemicals(so drugstore or even professional stuff) makes my hair smoother, straighter, and even thinner so I'd say that and leave in...


Also maybe consider how much you're washing your hair and adjust if its less than every day or every other day!
