 "I do not content to searches or seizures. I do not answer any questions." 

Also recording the police in public is not a crime, and since it is not a crime you cannot be detained for it.

Cops are legally allowed to lie to you so be prepared for bullshit about "officer saftey" and "We need to check your Id because we don't know who you are."

Read up on your rights and your right to record.  




 This happens.

 Bambuster works, also the ACLU just released an app that does just that. 




 For my fellow Americans. Your Rights. 




 My thought is that they are going to try every loophole they can. In the end it doesn't matter if the arrest was legal or not. Those fucking cops killed that man. 




 No. I prefer to be called,

 She is a fat tumblrina SJW. You will find no logic here.  




 So you are saying you receive no compensation for your moderation. Not even a hot pocket? 




 I bet the jews did this. 




 All the more reason to know your rights and to always record the police. Even if your not involved always record.

Ive know about these sting rays and fake cell towers for a long time.

 Lets not forget the biggest issue about all this.

Freddy Gray committed no crime.

So what this guy is saying is that BPD officers were at all times acting reasonably and in accordance with their training when they arrested a man for no crime at all.
 




 Ladies and Gentlemen the people running the country.  




 Sure was, headed by Chu himself. 

Also a bomb threat. https://archive.is/PhaQd 




 I haven't seen yeast like that since my ex girlfriends last infection. 




 Arm the public.

Local militia made of members of the community, selected by the members of that community. Trained in use of non-lethal and lethal take downs. And must know every word of the Bill of Rights/Constitution.

Remove all restrictions on gun ownership (unless someone has been convicted of using a gun in a crime).

Civilian over-site of all police nationwide.

End of Police Unions.

End the war on drugs.


And yes it sounds extreme and crazy but take a look at the country we live in now and tell me we are better off than what im suggesting.  




 thank you. 




 The best thing for Notch to do about this whole situation would be to tell her to go fuck herself, then donate to child's play.

 Cops investigate their own cops and find nothing wrong = not a conflict of interest. 

DA investigates and charges cops = conflict of interest. 

Fuck police unions.

 Thanks patriarchy.  




 Watched it and countless other videos like this. It fucked. This happens every day. Seriously go to /r/bad_cop_no_donut and /r/amifreetogo. Get involved in recording the police and knowing your rights. With enough of the public watching the watchers, the knowledge of it will get to the cops and hopefully make them think twice about being fuck heads.

Also if anyone shot my dog I would shoot them right in the face.  




 Holy shit microsoft get it together. How could you add 12 years to Liam.   




 Meth.


Not even once. 




 Mods please add a trigger warning. You know what I mean? 




 The war on drugs is fucking outdated and harmful to everyone involved. 

It is a felony to put a seed in dirt and grow it into a plant that in all of recored history has never killed anyone. But it is perfectly legal to set up a micro brewery and make booze which kills 100,000+ yearly. 

The drug laws in this country are completely idiotic and counter productive to a free society. 

I am completely agenst anyone being jailed for anything involving marijuana, makes no difference if that person is a cop or not.  




 All the more reason to record any and all interaction with the police. Even if you are not involved, stand back, dont interfere and record. That way when the police claim "camera malfunction" or the video "disappeared" you have proof of whatever it is they are hiding.

Also I see this going straight to the supreme court. The public has every right to see what public servants do in public.  




 Zoe is (by her own definition) a rapist. She is also a manipulative pathological liar who can't make a good game to save her life. She is not important to anyone other than her fellow kool-aid drinking cronys. She holds no power other than the power of professional victim.

 As someone who did a good bit of charlie years ago, I believe I know the how for the third picture.

Seems to me like someone was trying to bang some H, and after they were done they drew up some blood and shot it at the wall from left to right. 

Or after they drew up the blood the needle got clogged. So they pushed the plunger hard to unclog it. Which would explain the spray pattern at one end and the line going away from it

 




 Checks out, thank you for the reply, my mom would thank you too but she is still freaked out. 




 You maybe right, it has been over 10 years since I was in high school. 














 Single dads unite. Also you pretty much nailed it. 




 Doesn't matter if its your first offense or not they are gonna charge ya, the first offense part will only matter to the judge. 

They could press tons of shit on you but chances are its not gonna be to serious. 




 You were selling drugs on school property. There will be charges. 




 Its not up to the cop its up to the judge. Cops lie and are legally allowed to do so.

Your pretty much fucked, its not that big of a deal tho, just thow yourself at the mercy of the judge and be prepared to have to give up smoking for a bit. 

And beat that snitches ass.
 




 Gonna be that guy because someone has to.

You are a fucking idiot. 
Now that that's outta the way.

Never admit anything ever, and fucking most definitely do not give someone evidence of you commiting a crime. Like holy shit I get your a rich kid in California but have some sense. 

Secondly you beat that snitches ass. No discussion no nothing, walk up beat that ass.

Third selling bud on school grounds is a big fucking no. Yes its cali but that shit is still illegal and you will have to do some type of probation/diversion program. Something like some drug classes and piss tests for a few months. Could be more could be less.

As far as the school goes its on them if they kick you out or not. Cant say what will happen there.

If the cops show up and try to talk to you, you shut up. The only words you say are "I don't answer questions and I don't consent to searches or seasures." That's it nothing else. If they ask for your phone you say this and only this "Do you have a search warrant?" Chances are they will not but will lie and pull some shit to try and get it. Unless you see a warrant singned by a judge you give them nothing. 

Good luck, learn from this experience, read up on your rights (since you seem to not know them), never sell shit on school grounds,  and the biggest advice I have for you is don't be such a idiot. 




 Fuck community college, lets get drunk and eat chicken fingers.

Hey you go everyone, time to take these corrupt fucks down a few pegs. 




 How many cops does it take to change a light bulb?

10

1 to change the light the rest to beat the room for being black.

Shame. 




 You say this. "Thanks for the pussy n titties and all, but gotta go bitch, duty calls."

 Because Jessie and Al are race baiters, who do nothing more then exploit tragedy for political/monetary gain. 




 Lets do this shit.

I got a fucking cold because a snot nosed kid got my daughter sick. Which means I'm sick now. 

My ankle is fucked from falling while doing skateboard lessons with my daughter.

I'm outta smokes and don't feel like moving.

FUCKING SILENT HILLS IS CANCELLED. 

Lets hear it guys. Let it out. 




 Suddenly America's police force is gone. 




 I believe that most cops don't but most cops don't know that's what they are being prepared for.

You give a department military grade equipment and tell them that they are fighting a war on terror or drugs and the effect is obvious.  




  The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. 




 Suddenly I have a huge craving for baby back ribs.  




 Single dad here, who has had WIC/food stamps and insurance from the county/state. Of course I think single fathers should. Anyone who doesn't is stupid/sexist.  




 Slavs gonna slav. 




 The fuck am I even reading. 




 Yeah just for free money, not like that guy violated her right to recored or anything. 




 If cops don't want to be recorded by the public then they shouldn't be a cop at all. The public has the right to record what public servants do in public. 




 OP. 









 That's still a little to pricy for Gone Home.
