 For me- nutmeg. A whole teaspoon of it.. 














 Thank you! 




 Thanks :) 









 lol! Well played Sir. Well played. 




 Did you say 168mm not 16.8mm?!? Jesus. That's like apocalypse shit right there. Holy crap, can confirm. That's insane. 




 Always relevant for an upvote. 




 **I GOT A JOB!** Handing in resignation today. 




 No.. There's a lot of misinformation around, would love to hear some truth about whether it's going to snow!  














 I'm pointing it out as not impeding traffic is synonymous with keeping as left as possible. 

And again as a rider, it's good practise to keep left as you don't often hear drivers coming up behind you until it's too late.. 









 Indeed. Then I'm sure his aggressive attitude would have shown through when talking to the police man, his words ring with spite towards the officer who stopped him, so I honestly wouldn't be surprised if a "quick word with the cyclist asking him to be more courteous" escalated to the ticket by the cyclist blaming them for being asian!  




 Ok, so it's let break down his video.

For starters, he's not obeying the law of "keep left" in his own video evidence, at 00:26 he was firmly on the road, when there was the opportunity to ride on the left.

Then his commentary itself reeks of arrogances, let's have a look at his language:

* He said: "They missed a couple of opportunities to "quickly" navigate pass me"

 * For those who don't know the road, it's a very windy, very dangerous road. You have as little as 50cm either side of the white line before you either hit the cliff, or your wheels drop into a 30-90ft drop. You don't "quickly" nip past someone, unless you know the road really well.

* He said: "They **had** to follow me along the next straight"
 * This could easily be construed as "I did not let them pass." Better wording to help his cause would have been: "there were no opportunities for them to pass." we don't know why they "had" to stay behind him, but that sentence by itself doesn't sound very good in this context.

* He then goes on to say as they passed him: "Quite hesitatant, quite slow".."Looked sideways, international tourists"..
 * I cycled for a long time, if you have someone up your ass, you look behind you, **is he honestly telling us this is the first time he actually looked the van?** After all this time, he never actually looked behind him to see if he was holding up traffic, or how close they were? That's appalling driving full stop, you should ways look behind you!
 * Furthermore, this actually **completely** explains their hesitance, they were unfamiliar with the road, they were probably stressed by a growing row of cars behind them, and this guy wasn't budging an inch to let them pass.

All in all, this guy's coming across like a totally arrogant sod, and he did not do himself any good by going to the Press about it. At the very least he should have thought very carefully about what he was going to say, and not used any of the words, or examples he gave as I've proven any reasonable person can rip them apart and make him sound like he's the bad guy!

 









 He's checking facebook and texting during getting dressed? 




 I hate you. Have an upvote... 




 Woah, one of my more controversial comments. 

* Is it a stupidly implemented plan? Fuck yes.
* Was the news article deliberately worded to illicit maximum racism triggers? Oh you bet your click bait it was.
* Does it help people who need help? Well.. Yes, it does. For **that and that alone** it's a great idea.
* Is it racist? [According to the dictionary](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racism) it most certainly is a clear cut racist policy: "a policy, system of government, etc., based upon or fostering such a doctrine; discrimination."
* Does it help anyone? No. Ultimately now the cat's out of the bag, I really wouldn't want to be a policeman today! I can image a lot this today: "Oh you're just giving me a ticket cause I'm white?! Fuck you cunt! I read the news about you racist pricks not ticketing Maori! I'm not paying this."  




 Hmm. That's a disturbing thought... 




 At first glance, racist! Then I realise it's a really sad reflection on what must be a serious issue of people who probably simply can't afford to keep their car running, but need a car for work, children etc. 

Maori are proud kiwis, and no-one likes to ask for help, until it's too late. Honestly this is great, it puts those at in financial stress at the doorstep of those who can help.  




 For the record school uniforms make up a fantastic wee profitable side business.

The school puts out a tender for the lowest bidder to offer their services to design/make/sell the school uniform. The school then takes the cheapest tender, while basically being able to make their own price, and their profit.

They then take a cut of all the sales of said uniforms, while holding it above the students heads that they must wear a uniform.

It's a fucking monopolistic racket. 
If you're interest [this is worth a read.](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jan/18/school-uniform-results) It basically confirms "After eight years, Brunsma concluded that: "The results, although surprising to many, simply cannot be ignored. Uniforms do not make our schools better."

So I'm loving all the self righteous "The point of a uniform is to ensure there's equality with the students" comments. Bah! No uniforms are a source of massive profit for schools, and they want to keep it that way! 









 Further to this - if you don't want to go through the hassle of configuring a new email, you can [use an alias email!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_alias) 

A lot of email companies (ISP's etc) allow you to configure an alias email  to be sent to primary email account. Think of it like a mask for your true address.

For instance, say I have an email: "teherbil@fakecompany.net"
I approach Fakecompany, and ask them to configure a more profressional sounding alias:
"joe.bloggs@fakecompany.net" for my test_subject752 account.

Moving forward, you can put "joe.bloggs@fakecompany.net" in your CV etc, and when your **receive** email it goes to your test_subject752 account.

You can also configure Outlook and using the companies own email interface to **send** from that email account as well, with the reply coming back to test_subject752. 




 Or worst still a map I saw recently which was basically...

 No, that's not what I'm saying at all, both of those news agencies are bound by political views of the benefactors. They simply have to tread lightly for fear of eliciting your exact response. 

It's not like they're morally or financially obligated to accurately portray an unbiased or unfiltered view of the news, that's silly talk. 









 The very interesting there here is the SFO actually [investigated last year](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10140332/Kohanga-Reo-wants-apology-after-no-fraud-found) and "Serious Fraud Office inquiry cleared its commercial arm of misspending."

So either the SFO didn't do a good enough job, or the powers that be hid this very well.

Either way, this is going to be a powder keg I doubt Stuff or NZherald are going to reach touch upon properly. As OP mentions below, RadioLive refused to properly report upon it. 




 Nice! 

the frustrating thing is he'll be haemorrhaging cash with his dirty practices, a sustainable farm that reinvests effluent back into the land, can (after an initial small investment) provide a significant return. But too many farmers (at least when a few years back) are way too ignorant and set in their ways to change.

The sad thing is our environment can't keep up with the current rate of pollution from dairy farming, I was chatting to the guys who run the Waitaki/Ohau canal and dam system. Basically they've been working on the system for 20 years + and it's incredibly disheartening for them recently as the levels of the nitrates in the soil has lead to a significant impact on the quality of the water running through the system. 

It's so bad the colour of the water itself, which used to be a beautiful pale blue color, straight off the main divide is slowly turning brown as it's choked with pollution and weeds which thrive in the nitrogen rich water.

It's got to stop, or at least change significantly, as something has to give. 

It's not just the farmers future at stake, it's our childrens. 









 My sister in WLG might be able to help, she works in a nice wee cafe in the WLG botanical gardens. 

Pm me if you're interested and I'll hit her up.

As an aside WLG has awesome public transport, but defo worth taking a trip basically *anywhere*.

As for safety, **don't be bloody stupid and you'll be fine.**
Watch your drinks at the bar, put a pin and register your i-device etc with either "find my iPhone" Or "find my mobile" (Samsung and Apple) both have anti-theft features built in but you need to enable them! 




 From what I understand Steven Spielberg was like a masterful artist playing your fears against you, I found the less you saw of them, the scarier the dinosaurs were.

This movie however leans more towards visual impact without the background element of terror. Don't get me wrong it does a fantastic job! 

I couldn't agree more there's a reason that original movie still makes you crap yourself.. 




 It's pretty epic. I honestly think there's no human in the world that isn't in some way, shape or form that's curious about dinosaurs, and seeing them come alive almost illicit a child like sense of amazement in even the hardest skeptics! 




 That's about right ay.

Check with your Energy Provider, if you have a smart meter you may be able to get an hourly blow by blow of when the Energy's being used. If it is as you suspect the heatpumps - then it will show up as a huge spike when you turn them on.

Things you can try doing:

* Go to http://www.whatsmynumber.org.nz/ to see if you're on the best plan for your energy needs.
* Anecdotally Powershop are **not** the best value out there.
* Personally I've been happy with [Meridian Energy](https://www.meridianenergy.co.nz/)- they're also offering $150 and a free gift.
* [Genesys are offering a free bill (up to $250)](https://signup.genesisenergy.co.nz/)
* Look at getting a day/night meter installed (typically can cost around $70-90 - this offers you cheap electricity during the night (typically 10-7am) and usual rates during the day.
This  enables you to run things like dishwashers, washing machines, dryers etc during night time (with timers) and on cheaper electricity. *LPT: We also set our heat pump to start at 6.30am so it heats the rooms up during that initial surge useing the cheaper electricity!*

Find out why, but I presume you got their blessing to install it? 




 Yes, 9mo came off breast by himself after a cold around 7 1/2 months and was already on part solids (watties etc.) so transition him quickly to formula and solids.

Now has full meals at 9 mo (peas, carrots meat etc and watties to top up if he doesn't want to feed himself) and formula still (200ml * 3 per day). 

Once he could grasp he really enjoyed picking up the food, and it's helped his dexterity immensely. 









 Seriously? A pedestrian crossing is one of the few bastions of pedestrian safety mechanisms that provides the benefit to people to allow them to cross the road safetly, and gives people the right of way. 

To park across one is not just ignorance the the law it's also a middle finger to pedestrains to say: "Fuck you, my car and I own the road."

 We bought the zero excess for a Wellington 5 day car hire.


The reason being is simple, we couldn't afford it if someone hit us, the insurance sided with them and charged our card. Not likely I know but the extra price was just factored into the car hire budget.

The other benefit I didn't foresee was the car company didn't check the car before we bought it (just off a flight with a 9mo so great to get him to my relatives asap!) 

And likewise when we returned the car, they didn't need to check it, so we didn't need to assign an unknown period of time to have them check the car for damage. (Again tired, shitty sick 9mo!) 




 Chch, 9mo boy 




 Seriously? 
He was protecting his family, he didn't go out of his way to aggravate him. 

He didn't pull the fingers or yell obscenities at the guy, he "*motioned for him to slow down*" this guy was just looking out for his family!

Then again, he was drunk, and the courts seem to [smile fondly upon drunk drivers killing people](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/10232597/Drunk-driver-avoids-jail). /s

It used to be customer satisfaction = good profit. 
Now it's Good profit = investor happiness whatever the cost to customers. 




 Ah I see. Yes, I agree it's click-bait, but they have a point, and one that few other news places are willing to touch.. 

It does seem like the price of things are kept off main stream media, for instance Australia called the big companies and gave them a very public blasting for the ridiculous mark up on the price of software and other multinational products, while our media stayed silent on the matter. 

Again, (putting on tin foil hat) the NZ public have been subliminally trained to shut up and put up with whatever prices companies want to shove down our throats. 




 Not trolling, they have a good point. Here's a few recent issues with greed in NZ society:

* The Comcom decision to allow Chorus to charge a stupid amount of money in total disregard for the fact that Chorus have been overcharging consumers for years!

* Air New Zealand and others not decreasing the price of the airfare despite Oil prices dropping signifcantly (and fuel prices as a result) and subsequently the entire Airline industry is in for a record $29.9 BILLION dollar profit!

* Online payment "convenience fees" cropping up when paying online. (E.G. Vodafone when paying your phone bill via their Application)

* Beer prices in most cafe's and bars being $7.50+ at the cheap scale, at $12 for a single Corona etc. (they're $2 from the supermarket.) and then they complain people pre-drink..

* Schools forcing parents to buy clothes/stationery from 1 retailer, usually at a stupendous mark up, of which the school then gets a cut from.

* Most retailers charging a ridiculous mark up for supporters merchandise. (E.g. the Adidas debacle over the All Black shirt that could be bought for *hundreds* less overseas.

* Kiwi meat prices, we're charged more at our supermarkets than the meat is subsequently for sale for overseas.

Fuck, what else really? We have had the wool pulled over our eyes for many years that "buy kiwi" was best, but in reality we are being groomed to pay the ticket price, never haggle, and don't question status quo. 

As a result, greed has crept into the equation and subsequently the prices have risen steadily out of line with the cost of supply and selling and 99% of the time this profit has been driven back to the shareholders/bosses while the man actually doing the work gets minimum wage and told to shut up and accept it. 

/rant.

 I don't know if it's the same in the states as it here over here in NZ, but to be a licensed medication practitioner you need to attend a shit ton of courses and lectures in order to keep your knowledge completely up to date and in order to keep your license.

People who fail to comply can lose their license etc. 

So long as they keep their knowledge up to date and pass the necessary exams, why should they leave?  














 It's arguable it's *who you know* rather what *what you know* in **some industries** like IT for sure.

 But it's never the rich paying for anything, their smart enough to use the loopholes provided by the government's they voted in, like trusts etc. 

It's the working middle class like me (earning just above "average" wage) as the sole bread winner for my family, as I said I pay tax due to not earning enough to either hide, or to bother with hiding. 

I can't get any benefits as it stands, and as you said the increase in retirement age which is going to happen (and they are bumping the superannuation up more than any other benefit) will mean I, and peers my age will be paying even more tax before we can claim anything that's not mean tested, and that's even *if* the superannuation is around by then! 

Hence why "charge the rich" is joke! Direct from Google..

**New Zealand went through a major program of tax reform in the 1980s. The top marginal rate of income tax was reduced from 66% to 33% (changed to 39% in April 2000, 38% in April 2009 and 33% on 1 October 2010) and corporate income tax rate from 48% to 33% (changed to 30% in 2008 and to 28% on 1 October 2010).**

So there's your charge the rich, our government's have no interest in doing so, because the rich because put people in government. 




 Apt name there buddy.

 Indeed. Look here, provides the scary bell curve statistics for the ageing population with the future plotted too, didn't provide a pretty picture, the older generation are going to have a population boom soon.

Link: http://www.stats.govt.nz/populationpyramid2/NZPopulationPyramid.html 




 But the thing is it's not sustainable in any way, telling me that the rate of increases to the superannuation when at this rate we'll need to raise the retirement age to 70 in the next couple years is going to help anyone before the age of 50 is a slap in the face. 

For instance due to the income restrictions they place upon any benefits I can get put me out of range despite being on a single income family, with a young baby. We have to dip into savings each month to live. So despite the fact I'm been paying my fair share of taxes which go towards these benefits I can't claim any of them despite needing to. Old people however, some of whom I'm certain never paid taxes due to fantastic accountants are sitting there with taxpayers money rolling in each month without fail. What.The.Fuck? 

Now you look me in the eye and tell me that if they applied same income testing against super that they would still have to keep the came cap on the other benefits? I believe they would have significantly more money in the pot to allow more members of society access to benefits, like myself. 


I'm discriminated against due to my age. My wife and son are discriminated against by having an age based restriction placed against me (and them) as to what benefits we can claim, then further restricting these benefits based upon my income! 

Further more, the bell graph for nz aging population speaks volumes about the future of the New Zealand's increase in the amount of aged people:
http://www.stats.govt.nz/populationpyramid2/NZPopulationPyramid.html

Basically as is clearly visible the amount of old people is set to rise dramatically in the coming years. 

If the current economists are warning that *just* our current superannuation is not able to be sustained, especially at the way national this will become even worse! 




 And they are were? ...

I read news from a variety of sources and completely understand I am fed some bullshit from time to time, and I make the mistake of repeating them without checking them, for which I can only apologize for, however I would appreciate being corrected rather than just being told I'm wrong.  




 I'm not comparing us to other countries, relatively speaking we have had it good. However recently (past few years) it's just gone downhill. 
 
We've got as government that's spending ludicrous amounts of money on a flag referendum, which had no public support at all.

We've got a public service for unemployed that treat their customers like pieces if shit. 

We've got children dying in public housing due to a complete lack of fucks at housing NZ. 

We've got house prices going up $2000 a week and anecdotally a severe speculator and investor issue in regards to people inflating the prices of houses, which they profit from, ~~which then isn't taxed.~~ ^See ^below ^for ^correction

We've got the young walking out uni with stonking student loans and a government which isn't providing any incentives for companies to keep employing NZ staff.

We've got no government party with a meaningful action plan to address climate change. 

We've got families living in garages still in chch thanks to being shafted by their insurance companies, and again a government that couldn't give a Fuck.

 
And we've got a government which refuses to recognize there's a massive fucking rental problem in the major centres and they have an over budget, under delivered housing scheme to supposedly address it.


And that's just what I could think of off the top of my head. 
Pull your head from the sand, this country is being driven into the ground.

Fucking Wonderful. As if this cuntry (sic) needed another reason for the young to give to two middle fingers to this Godforesaken ageist bullshit old fart lead country who have little issue with burning the ties with the younger generation so the degenerates can sell off this country piece by piece to foreign buyers, reaping in the profits while these total fat cat pricks will sit back on their [parlimentary pension](http://www.nzpensionprotest.com/Home/the-offenders/the-real-double-dipper) while dipping into the pension and whatever other benefits they can get their grubby mitts on while they pay stupendous amounts of money to their accountants to hide the rest of their greed gotten ill gains from selling their property portfolio while they stoke the property market into a frenzy. 

Edit: Fuck our leaders. Just totally over their bullshit. 27 year old, I thought by this stage I would have more of an interest in politics, as I thought it would be more relevant to me. Now I've come to realise how completely out of touch our politicians are, how completely easily and lawfully they can be bought by corporations and other governments, and how there are no government parties that aren't greedy some way shape or form. 

None of them speak for me, none of them speak for the younger generation (18 - 35) and it's incredibly frustrating to hear time after time... Why aren't you doing better?... Why can't you afford a house?... Why don't you have a better job?... Why aren't you earning more?... When in reality those jokes, about "If I had a dollar everytime a babyboomer asked why we can't afford a house then we could probably afford a house with the economy they fucked over. 

My child has no hope of walking away from university without a horrendous student loan, and that's if the government hasn't allowed all the companies to outsource any job worth doing to a foreign country.

Our country is fucked. Our government is fucking it hard, you can't beat a dead horse, but you can rape it. 




 I know I came across like a fuckwit with my previous comments in regards to this subject (redditors who have long memories..) and I apologise, this is the best outcome from this horrible situation.
