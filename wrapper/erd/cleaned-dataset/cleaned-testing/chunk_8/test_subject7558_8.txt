 I thought buying anything on those darknet sites was illegal because there's no sort of tax to be paid? Or is it just illegal to sell stuff on it? I swear I read that somewhere. 




 Kratom. Look into it. 




 If there's one thing I know for sure, it's that I would fuck the shit out of Joan of Arc. That's one heroine I could do all night long, baby. 




 No. Get your source on. Everybody calls each other shills though. It's a term of endearment, you see. You filthy shill. 




 WHAT
 




 Now I have a boner. 




 Empty pill bottles. 




 I'm surprised the kratom didn't just slide right down your throat nice and easy, considering all the shlong you jam down it on the regular. 




 I tried changing the permissions, it didn't work or wouldn't let me change them, I can't remember. I'll try it again and I'll check out the other thing you just mentioned when I get home. Thanks 




 I originally tried installing Tor that way (by downloading it from the website) and I could never get it started. IIRC, it would just pop up a window full of code in gedit. I looked it up and found out that I have to download it from Software Center, so I did that, and it worked. However, when I tried to reinstall it yesterday from there, it still didn't work. After I get out of work, I'll try your suggestion again. I'm gonna be pissed if I have to install a different OS just because I can't get Tor to work. Actually I should probably just set up a dedicated USB drive for it anyway. 




 I already tried that last night. Still doesn't launch. Really aggravating.  




 Pretty sure there was an automatic update installed yesterday or the day before for Tor, and I don't remember whether I tried using it since then. It worked fine before, now the browser doesn't even start. I also went to software center and downloaded Vidalia, just to see if that would work, and it didn't. I already restarted. What do? 




 2.5 billion people don't have access to toilets. 6 billion people have access to cell phones, which means there's a whole shit ton of people out there surfing reddit that don't have the luxury of pissing in a toilet. How dare you. 









 Yes, I suppose it is. I'm surprised the smear campaigns launched by the media don't tell men everywhere that they'll be pissing sitting down. Might actually deter people. I think it's great. Unless I have a boner, and it touches against the inside of the toilet. I could do without that happening to me.

 I take 15-18 grams of kratom a day. Mostly red veins.

Because of my moderate kratom intake, I drink a gallon of water a day. 

I also chew tobacco all day long, which makes me incredibly thirsty all the time... I find that may actually work at my advantage  considering the dehydration kratom tends to cause. 

I probably piss in the toilet an average of 18 times a day. 

I realize a lot of toilet-pissing is to be expected when one drinks a gallon of water a day, but I feel like I really need to piss even more often than that should warrant.

Sometimes I'll piss in the toilet, and then 15 minutes later I'll feel like I need to piss in the toilet again, so I try to, and it takes a while for the piss to come out and then when it does, it's only like a 15 second piss. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, I get the "gotta go piss in the toilet" sensation even when it's unwarranted. Does anybody else ever notice this? 

It's also the same sensation I get when I'm doing meth or amphetamines, I feel like I always gotta piss a little. 

I can sort of understand why that is though, because the crank is speeding my system up and pushing fluids out or whatever. 

Unfortunate thing about meth-toilet-pissing is that I always dribble into my boxers a little bit after every piss. At least the kratom doesn't seem to have the same effect.

I digress.

I also seem to have a hard time getting the piss started. There's a lot of stop-n-go hesitation my stream as well. A touch of misting going on.

Because of this, I started sitting down when I piss. I'd done it before, when I was on opiates sometimes, because I would try to piss for an hour straight, and I'll be God damned if I'm gonna fuck up my buzz by standing there trying to piss for an hour, when I could at least be sitting on the toilet and nodding for most of it.

I own a smartphone. I use it every time I'm on the toilet. This just contributes to the madness. Gotta check reddit, gotta see who's locked up on MobilePatrol, fuck around and post a couple disgusting comments on Whisper, stay up to date with imgur. 

Between the pissing and the subsequent smartphone use, I probably spend an hour and a half on the toilet every day. 

TL; DR    Does kratom make anybody else have to piss when they really shouldn't even need to?

 




 That's what you get for living in a town with shitty weed. 




 Moneygram on local bitcoin 




 I just use my old lady's mouth to shit in. 




 Do you like hot sweaty shlongs slapped against your face? 




 Had you changed anything right before the issues started (strain, vendor, food)? Sounds almost like the kratom had bacteria in it. Almost like food poisoning, maybe? I don't have much knowledge on that sort of stuff.  




 Yeah I guess it can't hurt to swap the filter out and see what happens. Just after the warranty ran out, the brake line blew, and we took it back to the garage, where I was prepared to pay the full fee in order to have it changed, and the guy did it completely for free, so maybe he'll help me out. Lol. Probably not though. Ok, so I just started it up and got it up on some ramps. It was knocking right after it started, then it stopped, I drove it up onto the ramps and while I was driving up the ramps, it started knocking loudly, and the oil pressure light came on. I got to the top of the ramp and put it in park and I hopped out to go open the hood while it was still idling, and then I sort of heard a thunk and the knocking went away and the oil pressure light shut off and then it seemed ok, other than a very small knocking noise, which I could have probably dismissed as normal any other day.  




 Oh ok, that makes sense. It didn't seem to be idling lower than usual.  The oil pressure light came on right when I got to work, when we went up the inclined driveway, then it went right back off. The story I told you above, with the stalling, all happened within half a mile from my work. I'm wondering if it's a good idea to even start it and try to drive it to the garage we got it from or not. She just got it like 45 days ago, using buy here pay here at a local garage. Unfortunately it's past the 30 day warranty but I'm hoping maybe he'll do something for us in the way of a trade or something. I'm assuming he'll say no though, since he has the right to. 




 The oil filter is mounted upside down (with the threaded side facing skyward), on the side of the block. 




 Two days ago, I changed the oil on my old lady's 2001 Chevy Impala 3800. It has 118k miles. I used a FRAM Tough Guard oil filter, and SuperTech SAE 10W-30 oil. She went to work last night, and this morning she said she heard the engine knocking. She came and picked me up and took me to work, and when we'd almost made it to work, the engine was knocking badly. I told her to pull over so I could pop the hood, and it stalled. I popped the hood, checked the oil, which was right where it should be, and hopped back in and told her to keep driving to my work. It kept knocking, we got there and it stalled. The oil pressure light also came on and back off once or twice. I read that FRAM filters often have faulty anti-drainback valves. Has anybody here ever experienced the same thing? I plan on changing the filter later today, I'm just hoping that will do the trick. I could see it causing the engine to knock and the oil pressure light to come on, but would it cause it to stall? I also checked to make sure the filter or drain bolt isn't leaking. Thanks in advance. 




 Crack them mother fuckers open if you don't feel like waiting so long for the buzz to DROP ON YOUR FACE SON 




 This is a fine post, son. 




 You'll want to use a carrier pigeon.  




 To avoid abscesses in your arms, inject it directly into your testicle.  




 Yes. -3. 




 Sounds like you may be impervious to such things. Better go get you some heroin.

You're welcome 




 In the prison I was in, you could get a haircut from an inmate barber every other day if you wanted to. You just go to the barbershop during rec. You generally bring them some tobacco, although you don't have to according to the facility's rules, it's just the polite thing to do since those barbers don't get paid much for cutting your hair. 12 cents an hour or some shit. I always just had another inmate in my dorm do it right in the bathroom with a set of clippers, though. 




 Well, he did put a hit out on a dude. What do you think he should get? lol 




 I got caught with a little bit of leftover mud from cooking meth and I got a fuckin 4 flat with 3 post... and it was for personal use! Filthy assholes. I got out on bail, then got sentenced to four years, did 4 months in regular prison until my sentence got short enough for boot camp, then I went and did 8 months of that. That boot camp is a mother fuckin life saver, I only did 1 year out of 4 because of it, but I shouldn't have been sentenced to 4 fuckin years for personal use in the first place.  




 I got a buddy that'll give you three bucks for a handjob. You can use the extra thirty cents for a couple of ramen soups. 




 I'm pissed cuz I want to see what everybody's raving about, but I'll shit in my hand and eat it before I'll ever spend more money on that shit again. 




 That's funny, I ordered the Maha Kali and it made me shaky and feel like shit. This was 2 or 3 months ago. Maybe it was the same batch you had. It was the only time I've ever tried it, I just gave it away for free the other day. 




 TL; DR  I got really high and enjoyed it but I could still talk so I might have gotten ripped off. help 




 I thought his ma was addicted to injecting semen 




 It might be a good idea to abstain from kratom for 24 hours before you do, considering the dehydration aspect of it. 




 Oh, I can see why you believed him.  Because it's totally possible to dump a spoonful of leaf grounds into a cup of coffee without the drinker even noticing. 




 Mother fuckers be trollin. Mother fuckers be fallin for it, too. They always do. 




 BOBANDY
 




 Oh I know I'm right, that's why I agree with you bro. My buddy was taking 5 grams of all natural Red Sumatran after he came down on Adderall, and it basically just took the edge off and let him sleep. I said "No, no, no, you're doing it wrong" and I handed him a few Xanax for the next time he was coming down off Adderall. He took them and just banged his head off stuff in his apartment for about an hour and then he passed out. I was happy to reduce his harm that day. We're doing the Lord's work, son. 




 You're right, benzos are much safer than kratom. What were we thinking? 




 Sometimes I get the numbers "3" and "10" confused too. 




 I just wanted to let you know that I found this post mildly entertaining. Thanks bub. 




 Red vein mother fuckin Sumatran, son. 




 Don't worry. It's probably just HIV. 




 Mine is more like  




 I jacked off into a napkin this morning. 




 I dunno. I'm being sarcastic. I have no idea what he means. 




 I'm actually the complete opposite. Kratom is the only thing I've ever found (outside of weed) that I can use at the same dose 3 times a day and still have it work every time.  




 THEY GIVE THE DASH TO YOUR POST, HOW IS THAT HARD FOR YOU TO COMPREHEND 




 The test_subject7558's hilarity is timeless, son. 




 My thoughts exactly. 




 What 




 It's done a lot for me too, man. It worries the hell out of me that there's people out there who don't know shit about it,  and they're trying to get it banned. 




 Which antiemetic do you use? 




 I've never tried it, and IDK all that much about it, but I would check this out if I was in the same predicament: https://www.bluebird.com/ 




 What are they going to report me for? Talking about things other than kratom? Kratom keeps me off the meth and other drugs. That's how it's relevant. Either way, you can't tell me what I can or can't talk about. I never portray kratom in a negative light. Are you trollin me, son?  




 Suboxone for the rest of your life? You can't even feel it every time you take it, you just feel normal. It does nothing for cravings after you're accustomed to it. I've been on the sub maintenance program twice. However, I feel great from kratom every day when I take it, three times a day... Every fucking day. It completely eradicates any sort of cravings I have. Kratom is a thousand times more effective than subs. You should think about switching completely. 




 Get looped on kratom? Pfft. Let me know when you find it. 




 There's a shit storm brewin
