 Seconded! How strange does "African-Canadian" sound? Such silliness... 




 I'm response to having an old man smell:

"I know what he's talking about. I grow mungbeans in my desk. Highly nutritious, but they smell like death" 




 Do it. It's pretty good. Definitely worth more than a "meh" and in the same vein Captain America as the lead impressed me I kept forgetting it was him, he did really well.  




 Loved it. Now I have to watch that movie again. Thanks for the reminder :) 




 We have a Hannibal poster with Mads with blank eyes and antlers and blood drips in the background and it's terrifying. That show is SO good. Makes me want to eat people. I've never wanted that before... 




 This whole comment thread is deleted, yet I knew we were talking about Frank Reynolds from your comment alone. Well played sir.

Also, devito in that role is the perfect answer to this question so I don't know why it's deleted.. 




 YES! It's arguable he reinvented his acting career starting with that role; no one expected him to commit so fully to being ridiculous; it was amazing and hilarious and made me appreciate him as an actor again. 

Sidenote: he also really impressed me in Edge of Tomorrow, plus that whole movie rocked pretty hard.  




 Always remember to scream! Sometimes I tell myself that if I'm feeling anxious or something that if I just start screaming, everyone will leave me alone. Never had to use this tactic in an actual potentially life-threatening situation (or any situation honestly) thank god, but it's a comforting thought. Be your own alarm and scare assholes away!

Edit: accidentally submitted comment halfway through writing it, had to hit edit to finish writing it :p 




 That's why I'm confused tho; maybe he was obnoxious before the video started but from what I saw all the gun dudes were being pretty chill and just marching and trying to avoid fighting with all the people screaming at them, no?

Or maybe it's a time and place situation? This was not the time and place to highlight open-carry issues so maybe that's obnoxious? I feel like calling it racist is a bit of a stretch tho, but maybe I don't know the whole story..
