 OP is just another MRA nutjob stirring up controversy, move along, nothing to see here 




 Agreed. The article called him a gay cartoon in the show, I think that's pretty accurate. 




 I am generally OK with the many larger changes the show makes - Sansa taking Jeyne's place, Jamie and Bronn in Dorne, etc - They make sense given a limited scope and timeframe. I agree that they'll miss out on some great Barristan scenes, but I guess they have a different direction in mind.

I still have a problem with the way some characters are portrayed. I feel the show really misses the subtleties of certain characters, mainly Tyrion and Littlefinger. The actors are great for both, don't get me wrong, but Tyrion is totally whitewashed and is missing his darker side. Littlefinger is portrayed almost comically evil, whereas in the books I feel he is more clever and not an obviously villain to anyone with half a brain.  














 You could not play thoughtsteal. .. 




 Wizards has been hilariously inept when it comes to digital gaming, so don't cross your fingers. Are they just giving up on the giant piece of crap known as Magic Online? 




 Then play chess. Randomness in all card games is accepted by its players and balances itself out in the long run. 




 MTG is just as reliant on randomness as Hearthstone is. You just don't see it as blatantly as with Knife Juggler/Ragnaros. The mulligan system alone... 




 no 









 Factotum is in between the two. As an aside, it also has my favorite Bukowski quote in it - 

"How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 8:30 a.m. by an alarm clock, leap out of bed, dress, force-feed, shit, piss, brush teeth and hair, and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?" 




 I'd go with Factotum next 




 If you're falling asleep when you read, read at a different time of the day. Also, don't read in bed 




 play less video games

watch less tv 









 Did neil degrasse tyson ever record any audio books? 

Did bill nye ever record any audio books? 

Did Chris Pratt ever record any audio books? 

Did Gabe Newell ever record any audio books? 

Did snoop Dogg ever record any audio books? 

 




 Celebrity worship combined with having practically nothing to do with books?  




 is it a sequel to city of stairs?

edit: turns out it is. One reason I liked City of Stairs because there are so few good standalone fantasy novels. I guess it no longer qualifies, but I'm still interested in the sequel... 




 is this r/books or r/circlejerk? 




 * *a cure for suicide* by jesse ball

* *the sarah book* by scott mcclanahan 




 120 days of Sodom by marquis de sade 




 *Sometimes a Great Notion* by Ken Kesey 




 a 3 year old is most likely not going to enjoy the hobbit. wait 3 or 4 years 




 I'd try *Book of the New Sun* by Gene Wolfe then 




  Characters are humorless, often overinflated badasses who just say cool things and kill stuff with aplomb. It reads like a teen's role-playing chatroom: "And then I do this, because I'm awesome!" 

Pretty sure he won't like Name of the Wind 




 It sounds like you hate fantasy. My real recommendation would be to just avoid it, but you could try something more literary I guess - Gene Wolfe, Italo Calvino, Angela Carter, etc. 




 Mercer Meyer's *Little Critter* books

*Where the Wild Things Are* by Maurice Sendak

edit: my kids also really like books where they can interact with things. Examples are the books *Don't Push the Button* and *Tap to Play* 
























 bingo 




 Holden Caulfield 



















 r/homeworkhelp 



















 there are a million other renowned authors out there, read something by one you actually like instead 




 I thought it was kind of average. Nice prose, lot of cliches. 



















 It makes me laugh that people claim Sanderson is "the best fantasy writer alive" when his dialogue is simply pretty bad. How can you be the best alive if you can't write dialogue that isn't cringe inducing? 




 Kobo Abe is really great. He is like the Japanese Kafka. 




 the enormous boom of dark fantasy. The TV show is also incredibly influential, just take a look how game of thrones knock offs there are already 




 David Markson -  *Readers Block, This Is Not A Novel, Vanishing Point, The Last Novel* 




 psstt.....he's dead 




 lol yeah dude the government never hides anything 




 I really like Bukowski, but I can definitely understand your viewpoint. I think he still has something to offer, but wouldn't fault anyone for not wanting to read him. 




 never read him actually, though taipei is in my TBR pile 




 * Sam Pink - Rontel/Person

* Scott McClanahan - Crapalachia/Hill William/Collected Works

* Megan Boyle - selected unpublished blog posts of a mexican panda express employee

recommend starting with Scott, easily one of my favorite authors 




 I generally agree with you, but it's the sanitation/self censorship inherent in YA that draws me away. I don't want to read something the author had to write down to a more consumer friendly level. 




 There are plenty of entertaining adult books too 




 My major qualm with YA is the readers who only read YA and wear it like a badge of honor. Anti-intellectualism is nothing to be proud of. 




 Both sides are guilty, yes. I'm pretty comfortable in thinking the side that is actively advocating hatred towards other groups is worse though 





























 Clearly *Stoner* by John Williams 




 Not too hard when your job is grinding hearthstone matches 




 My complaint is that these things detract from what I actually go to a bookstore for - a good selection of books. I don't care that Amazon sells them as well, because Amazon's selection is enormous.

Why should I take the time out of my day to drive down to a bookstore for a book they may or may not have at a higher price? What incentive is there for me? 




 What an asinine comment.

Major chain bookstores deserve their death - horrid selection of books, prices higher than Amazon, half the floor space dedicated to toys, board games, ereaders, and Starbucks.

Indie bookstores I am more sympathetic for, but more of them need to adapt. There is a pretty charming indie bookstore near me. Browsing their selection, I came across a used book I was interested in that they were selling for more than 40 bucks. I'm not asking for a price match, but a quick look on my phone showed multiple retailers selling it for $0.01 plus 4 bucks shipping.

If you are actually lucky enough to have a bookshop with fair pricing, an eclectic selection, and cool events like author readings, yes, you should probably support your bookstore if you are there often.

I am rooting for local bookshops in this time of ebooks/amazon/major chains, but the onus shouldn't be on me to support them if they refuse to adapt. 









 my man. harry crews is criminally underrated. 




 you aren't really qualified to criticize a book if you only read 20 pages 




 That's not the focus of the books at all. Yes the world is gritty, but HBO and mass media make a much bigger deal of the violence and nudity. 




 you must not read that much then 




 Don't forget the awkward sexualized 15 year old! 




 Depression and death of a sibling are first world problems? 




 Mr. Flieslikeafish, Mongoloid, Esq.:

You are, in your incomprehensible babble, unable to assimilate stimulating concepts into your retarded and blighted worldview. We here at r/books do not wish to be bothered in the future by such tedious complaints. If you molest us again, sir, you may feel the sting of the lash across your pitiful shoulders. 




 I like it!  




 On the Beach. Interesting premise, but awful characterization. All female characters are written as one dimensional, wooden, and helpless. Totally unbelievable reactions from all characters. Boring as anything to boot 




 The Hugos are irreparably damaged. 




 Doesn't give you a get out of being an asshole free card, sorry 




 lol, you really took the article to heart dude. "ladies you are welcome to play as long as you aren't slutty trash" 




 What source is more reliable to break the news than kdramastars.com 




 Very much agreed, that's a large reason why I stopped playing competitively 




 welcome to playing magic the gathering... 



















 That's not quite the point of this thread, is it 




 there's a surprise 




 you're an idiot 




 It isn't bad, but you're probably missing out on a lot of books you may like. Have you tried reading recent acclaimed works - 2666, Middlesex, Gilead, The Corrections, etc? 




 What does immersion have to do with a quality storyline? 




 Let's be real here. I'm no stranger to gaming myself, and claiming that "you make all the decisions yourself" is painting with a bit of a broad stroke. There are very few games that allow you total or even partial freedom. Something like Mass Effect style choices are akin to choose your own adventure books, maybe even simpler. 




 Dark Souls and Bloodborne are both exceptions rather than the rule. I would include both in games with a good storyline. Even still, the number of games with a quality storyline is only a handful. 




 For every Planescape Torment there are mountains of awful, hackneyed storylines. 




  i like stories, but right now im interested in some books that will expand my knowledge, or be useful in real life.

Maybe you should read a book that explains how fiction can do all of that and more 




 Unepic is pretty bad. Boring combat, tedious gameplay, awful humor. One of the worst metroidvanias I've played. 














 I read 5 of them. Silence Once Begun, Annihilation, All the Light We Cannot See, and Station Eleven are all pretty great 




 Everything isn't literal 




 Kraken is probably his worst book. Mieville isn't for everyone but I wouldn't judge him solely based off one of his least liked books 









 a new marketing term 









 No it isn't, nobody is giving dynasty advice. He sucked last year and was overhyped 




 After seeing what was done with the True Blood Series, do you have interest in doing a television adaptation of the Midnight, Texas series? If so, what would you do differently (Would you still go to HBO? Would you try to have more of an active involvement in the production? Would you try and keep the adaptation closer to the books?) 




 I don't think there's anything wrong with enjoying YA novels - they can be entertaining and should be judged individually rather than as a genre. 

That said, I find it weird that some people choose to only read YA novels, and wear that fact like a badge of honor. Is there something to be proud of in only liking novels that are less challenging and more accessible?

 









 One of my all time favorites 














 Investigative journalism seems to be under attack around the world. I wish him luck. 














 "As beautifully wrought and subtle and nuanced as some of these tales can be, they still largely tend to serve the function of propaganda, regardless of the authors intention. Even in condemning war, they end up romanticizing, glorifying, and legitimizing it on some level (often on many levels) and are added to a giant heap of stories that do the same."

Pretty much why I won't be bothering to read Phil Klay's book

 




 my dick is huge too! 




 goodreads.com 














 The man is a living legend 




 He is about as far as you can get from cool, he's a homophobic douche 









 Reread the Phantom tollbooth recently, it was still enjoyable 




 I don't understand some of the criticism about this book. Not liking a character has nothing to do with the quality of the book. He's meant to be an unlikable character, that's the point 




 don't do this, the fourth book is underrated. Cersei's storyline in particular is great 




 how dare you criticize reddit's lovechild 




 The entire book itself isn't even 200 pages... 




 It's incredibly dense though, page count is a poor indicator. That said, it's one of the few books I've really hated as well.
