 **...anytime...** 




 Wouldn't be surprised if it was still Jax's voice. 




 Another klassic ninja skin? Awesome. Won't be long before we have the full set... hopefully. I know a lot of people really want a klassic Ermac skin, I hope they get it.

That infrared skin, is it just for Scorpion or is it for eveyone? I think Scorpion's got enough costumes already. 




 Mah ninja. 




 Probably the one where God flooded the Earth, killing very nearly every living thing, and not giving a fuck while doing it.

That's pretty metal. 




 hIS RAMPAnT anD UnBRiDLED CAPITaLISAtION UPsets mE! 




 What do you guys think about the outrageous price (considering the content on offer) of the next Destiny expansion, The Taken King, and the fact that if you own the game and all current DLC you'll have to completely re-buy the game and the DLC if you want the new emotes they're offering? 









 Ok, thanks. 




 OKC? 




 Pretty impressive paint considering it doesn't smudge onto everything he touches.  




 Does the stats of the parents affect the stats of the child? If so I need to turn Dr. Li into a baby making machine! 




 I didn't mean it like all game have been 60fps before these la two generations, just that they seemed to have more games running 60fps than the recent gens do.  




 Yeah. I've played plenty of games on my PS4 that run at 60fps, like Rogue Legacy and Metal Gear Solid V Ground Zeroes. 60fps is possible on these consoles, but I guess some devs are either too lazy or too inept to make their games run at 60fps **cough Ubisoft cough** 




 I see it now. Thanks for clarifying. Seems to be missing a load of frames of animation for the slap. 




 "Why would you give us brains capable of rational thought, but then punish those of use who exercise that rational thought and come to the conclusion that not only is it unlikely that you exist, but it's logically impossible?" 




 I CAN ask any question. I don't understand yours I'm afraid. 




 You used "to" when you should have used "too". Nice try English impersonator!

Comcast confirmed ;) 




 Nah what ain't? I don't understand what you're disagreeing with me about. It seems we agree that the latest batch of consoles are having difficulty with meeting 60fps, so where's the beef?

Can't believe I managed to fit "where's the beef?" into a sentence and have it be contextually accurate, lol. 




 I don't get it. 




 1. I don't think covering mass shootings actually encourages them. It probably doesn't discourage them though.

2. Was going to comment on your misuse of the word "your", but I see someone beat me to it, and your reply made me smile. So have a few upvotes on me. 




 Consoles have been capable of 60fps for years. It's only the recent generations with their much much much  more complicated graphics and physics engines that are having difficulty. 




 I must be missing something. Does she just salute and then their face explodes? 




 You can get lunchboxes by completing some challenges. The lunchboxes have given me some great loot that I've not come close to finding in the wasteland yet. I haven't bought any lunchboxes yet though. They gave us a few near the beginning to whet our appetites, now they're really few and far between. 




 So he grew up and started dating his mum? 









 How is [Retro Bruce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa6iCGHRzqQ) not constantly at the top of r/ladyboners? 




 "...jams a pistol into the man's skull."

Not really, more like "...puts a pistol to the man's head." 




 One of the good guys. See? Good cops do exist, they just don't get anywhere near the attention of the bad ones. 




 Let's see if this makes it to the front page 2 days running. 




 I started with Unbreakable Sub Zero but someone recommended I switch to GM because of my playstyle. I've never looked back.

Well, I look back from time to time at that awesome ice mask I so dearly miss. 




 Hayfever. 




 I got Dr. Li from a lunchbox as well as a guy called John Rice, both have very high intelligence.

Making a stimpack in 90 seconds? Yes please. 




 I just get sick of all the PC master retards gloating over every little console issue, feels good that the boot is on the other foot.  




 Never played. Pay day game.  









 Klassic ninja FTW. 




 Shit, I'm too lazy to find the thread from 2 days ago when this was posted and leech the top comment.

Damn. 




 Hmm. Might buy.

Next story. 




  I'm gonna fail out of college

Were you even alive when FFVII was released? 




 I never played Kingdom Hearts 1 or 2 seeing as though I was 17 at the time and was more into Metal Gear Solid and Tekken than I was Disney characters.

What makes the games so good? Seems they've got a massive following. 




 This is great news. I was concerned that the long anticipated follow up to the most expensive game ever (at the time) was going to only cost $2million.  




 Hey, it's a rare day when PC gamers suffer while console players have no issues. Let me have this.

I need this... 




 stages in this game arent very hype

What does that even fucking mean? 




 I thought it was a mix of that and saving people from wasting their 3G on videos they never get around to finishing. 




 But... but... the mustard race! 




 I first unlocked the snowball one, but found it difficult to get on unless I was fighting a noob.

I was so relieved when I got the simple "freeze then uppercut" one with no criteria needing to be met like having 40+ seconds left on the clock or other shit like that. 




 Or you could just do what I do. Watch them show up in youtube sub box. That way I get to see all the trailers and announcements, and then reaction videos from people who's opinion I enjoy hearing. 




 I believe your username reveals the answer. 




 I'd imagine organs with some wiggle room, I dunno. 




 Good to know. 




 I know cats can tell you they're angry with their ears, but dogs can tell you they're happy/excited, sad/upset. Cats only really have one emotion anyway, indifferent. 




 It's just a simple way of conveying emotion. It seems like a horse's face can't emote like a human's without looking, weird. We know a lot of animals emote with their ears (dogs primarily). Not sure if horses do in real life. It doesn't seem strange to me that Bojack's ears move, in fact I'd say it seems quite logical. 




 Ever consider some people just want closure on the story? They just left us hanging on a cliff.

Also, each Half Life game that was released pushed the boundaries of what FPS games were capable of, and pretty much set the standard for the genre when they were released. The games might not be what the masses consider to be fun or exciting (although they are), they're technically groundbreaking games. This is why people want Valve to make another one. 



















  but really it's entertainment and to hold it to such serious standards

They hold it to a much more serious standard than I do, lol. Every time I see a hip hip/rap music video (well, 85% of them) I just laugh at how ridiculous I find the whole thing. 




 I never did it back when I was at school, and even if I did that was 15+ years ago, so no, I don't still do that.

Never heard that rhyme before. 




 The whole false bravado thing they have going on.

"Look at me! Look at how rich I am! Look how much weed I smoke! Look how I wield my AK! Look at my car! Look at those shiny wheels! Look at all these hot women I paid to be in my video! Look at my comically over sized clothes! Look at all this jewelry I wear! Look at how much of a big hard gangster I am!"

Then watch them go home and be told by their wife they're not allowed chicken, so they have to send their assistant out to get it on the sly.

I find the whole thing to be a cringe worthy joke, the fact they take it so seriously only adds to the hilarity. I have no interest in listening to something that musically is extremely basic (often to the point of just re-using music someone else made that was already popular), and lyrically is both vapid and a lie.

There are some good hip hop songs, don't get me wrong. I don't think it's all shit, just the stuff I've mentioned here. Which seems to be 85% of it. 




 I remember we sang hymns at primary school during morning assemblies. After a while I realised I simply didn't buy the notion of a god and then stopped singing the hymns. No-one ever called me out on it, might have been different if I'd been in an American school. 




 What's hidden about it? Can't you unlock all the brutalities in the krypt? 




 I never got far in FFVII. I borrowed it from a friend back when it came out but never got off the first disc, I've had it on my PS3 for about 3 years now and haven't managed to play past the first 6 hours or so. I'm sure the game is good, but I can never seem to get into it. Final Fantasy VIII was my FF when I was younger (followed by X of course).

Hopefully this remake will keep me entertained enough to want to go back to the original one day and complete it. 









 Well that clears that up then. Thanks.  




 Uh... "A" to jump? 




 I didn't know 3 had MP. Was that in the subsistence version? I never played that version until I got the HD collection on PS3, and I never noticed MP in that version, although I wasn't looking for it.  




 we wanted to show people we could do it, and how little we care about it. 




 I wish the video wasn't limited to 144p. I must see this creature in higher quality so I can attempt to identify it. 




 "Shhhh. Just let it happen." 




 Ive never liked the horse shit mechanic. It just looks so fake compared to the general graphics in the game, at least to me.  




 What makes you think life has a meaning or a purpose? We exist, that's about all we can say.

Something I like thinking about is what is the one thing ALL life does, or tries to do?

Procreate/Attempt to perpetuate the survival of it's species.

By this logic you could argue that anyone who has a kid that reaches adulthood has technically won at life, kinda. 




 "That's be great."

Great grammar. Also making childish demands like this makes you seem like an asshole. 




 I don't care. My reddit usage hasn't changed one iota. Storm in a teacup. 




 It's fine. I don't feel like I'm in danger when using reddit. It's just a typical kneejerk reaction to people's freedoms supposedly being oppressed.

It seems a lot of people seem to think that reddit is somehow affected by the US government's constituion regarding free speech. Reddit owns reddit, they can silence whatever they want. I almost cannot believe how much of a big issue is being made over this, and the childish reaction from many redditors just makes me happy that a lot of them claim to be ready to leave reddit. We'll be better off without them.

Also people like to use the slippery slope argument. Whatever. What's the worst thing reddit could to us? Shut down the site I guess, that would be the ultimate form of "suppression of free speech", even though they're stopping people from saying what they want elsewhere.

I guess it depends on what you mean by safe. 




 On more than one occasion in the last year I've seen a guy, looks to be in his early 20's, riding an electric unicycle while I'm on my way home from work. It looked like this one but was dark grey instead of high viz yellow. Was weird as hell to watch. But so cool. 




 And I remember Tekken 3 being 45 at release. I guess different games have different prices. 




 I played the shit out of Metal Gear Solid 4. I tried the multiplayer once and hated it beyond words, to the point where I groaned with disappointment when they announced multiplayer in MGSV.  




 True. But it seems every day someone in America posts a random dog/cat they just found wandering around outside. 




 Good response, thanks. 




 Some were, most were 40. Maybe games were cheaper where you live for some reason. 




 My mistake. Should have read it properly. Thanks for the clarification. 




 Huuuge bucket of win. 




 Not just the 90's. He recently released [this single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TnFIDKyX50) just a couple of years ago. 




 Does America have a serious problem of just cats and dogs all over the place looking for homes? Seems every day someone makes a post to reddit about how some random homeless animal turned up and now it's theirs. How are animal shelters still running with so many free pets everywhere? 




 I hope you're doing something about that morbidly obese pet. 




  30 used to be the norm

When? I remember Street Fighter II Turbo and Sonic Spinball being 55 back in 1993. That equates to roughly 101 in today's money. Sure most games weren't 55 back then, but some were. I remember the average price of a Mega Drive game being around 40, going up 10 - 15 in 20 years isn't so bad really. Games may technically be more expensive now but considering how little the price has risen since the 16 bit era compared to how much content games now have they've never been better value for money than they are right now. 




 FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK you Konami. 




 So it's true, Konami ARE trying to burn the MGS franchise to the ground like that guy once said. 




 *if it gets out of control. 




 Claws, not toenails. 




 Upon further thunking I suppose the Indian guy represents that part of Asia (Pakistan, India etc). The American Asian guy represents the other part of Asia (Japan, China etc), while the French guy represents Europe.

Maybe. 




 I still don't buy the trailer just happening to reconnect on it's own. I don't believe it. 




 So there's two Americans, a different kind of American, a Frenchie, and an Indian guy.

This represents the whole world according to the director. 




 It is cool, as it was yesterday. 




 The guy said all he used was a "handling mod". Looks like this mod includes super turbo and auto "suck trailer back to the hook up point of the truck" features. 




 She didn't make /r/ALL FPH, childish morons who have kneejerk reactions to shit did that for her. 




 [How I feel about this whole thing.](http://tasteuni-co-uk.optimizewpcom.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14309-go-to-the-winchester-have-a-nice-cold-pint-and-wait-for-all-of-this-to.jpg) 




  But they never actively harassed someone out of the subreddit

Irrelevant whether it's in or out of the subreddit surely. What's SRS anyway? I keep hearing people say it but don't know what it is, sounds really shitty though.

they only hate those who are fat and deny it, or ignore it.

Well, that makes their harassment ok then. /s 




 If it's a shithole you think should burn why are you still here? 









 Those new replacement subreddits are obviously created with the sole intention of replacing the old ones and continuing to harass people, that's why they're getting banned. 




 I just woke up and logged on, let me know if I've got this right.

The story is cunts told to shut up, people get upset? 









 Perhaps.  




 I just checked out one of the other angles. I'd really love to know how how got that speed in that truck given the relatively short road leading up to the jump. Experimenting later. 




 To make it seem more impressive.

But yeah, since he said that I guess I'm inclined to believe him. I'm curious to know how this custom handling mod affects trailers. I'm going to record and post my own attempts at this jump on PS4 and see if the truck really can fly that much from that jump. 




 "Kombat me, FOOL!" 




 The free aim shooting in fallout 3 and new vegas are pure shit. I'd say 99.9% of my kills with guns in those games was using vats, the control really was that bad. At least on console. 




 Vats is what makes Fallout stand out. Fallout is an RPG and those numbers have to count somewhere, with vats you can see the numbers in action. 




 Two reasons I don't use horses in Skyrim.

#1. I have a follower.
#2. They're shit. 




 Not in a truck like that, pulling a trailer. 




 There's no truck in the game that would fly like that off that jump without moon gravity, especially pulling a trailer.

I might have to check later on just to make sure. 




 You got an apostrophe right and then neglected to use one in "reddits".

0/10 unsubscribed would recommend to a friend. 




 Indeed. I do enjoy his dialogue though. Not sure why. I just like the words he uses. 




 FYI. They're called couch gags. 




 It's too awesome to believe. Obviously moon gravity is on. Seems too good to be true without mods though. 




 [Literally every man in this thread](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/dgbg.gif) 




  There is nothing wrong with telling someone this in hopes that they will make a plan and succeed. 

I agree. But saying it in a dickish manner as he did was unnecessary. It seemed like he was bringing anger from people in r/fitness to people who did nothing to warrant the attitude. 




 Raiden's character is like this.

Tries to protect Earthrealm. Is pretty much useless at his job. 




 This is the kind of attitude I've come to expect from regular gym goers, and one of the reasons I don't go. 




 This concerns me about going to the gym. I need to start going to work off the flab I've built up in the 4 years I've had this office job, but I've never been to a gym before. I don't want to end up on youtube as one of those noobs who's using a machine wrong or something like that. Plus I keep hearing tales of assholes at gyms.

Maybe I'll just take up jogging instead. 




 "Homeboy!"

Classic line. Also, is it just my player or is the video really fucking stretched horizontally? They all look like super midgets. 




 It was delicious.  




 When he fights Jason he simply says: 

"Kombat me, fool!"

So fucking cool.  




 It happens in the natural world, who are we tip the balance in the bee's favour? 




 It just looks medieval to me. If the Elder Scrolls hadn't been mentioned in the title the thought would never have crossed my mind. 



















 I don't recall saying I don't find it compelling.  I'm looking forward to seeing it. I liked Silent Running, and this seems like it's got a similar theme.

I was just wondering what I was missing, it seemed everyone was super mega excited about it and I didn't know why. Now I now why. It was a popular book and people love Ridley Scott.  




 I wasn't looking at my phone. I shut the video off because it was time to leave work and go home. 




 "I remember now! Today is the day I met you!" 




 SPAAYCE! 




 I don't recall saying anything about interacting with them, but how do you know aliens wouldn't interact with us? We don't know their motives. Sure it's more likely that they'd observe us before doing anything, that's just common sense.

 Once they realized we're all poo-flinging hate monkeys, they'd likely pass us by.

I bet if we're the first planet they've seen with life on it (besides their own) they'd be pretty interested in us. 




 If they found us I reckon they'd observe us for a while, no idea what they'd do after that. They might just leave once they see how primitive we are compared to them. If this is the first planet they've seen with life on it (besides their own) they'd probably either want to interact with us, or they might do the whole "Don't interfere with nature" thing.

My thing is if they've got the tech to get here they'd surely have the tech to remain hidden from us, and they certainly wouldn't come all the way here to just crash like some people think, they'd be pretty inept aliens if they did that.

Sure there's some unexplained sightings, but they're just that, unexplained. Most sightings have been explained as being something like a plane, weather balloon (cliche I know) or just strange lighting. I think the time to believe aliens have visited us is when there's good evidence to support it, not anecdotal heresay and footage which can be easily manipulated digitally. 




 I'll agree with you that maybe the skater should have taken more care. Still a total over reaction by the mother though. She was acting like she was certain he ran into the kid on purpose. 




 For some reason I don't buy Matt Damon as an astronaut from these two trailers, maybe it was the line "I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this." That line just sounds fucking dumb to me. He just seems like the wildly unscientific scientists in Prometheus  




 I know man. It was "coming soon" for what felt like months. then it arrived and was immediately removed because it somehow still wasn't ready.

I'm beginning to think this game is being supported by monkeys. I haven't played for over a week. I refuse to play until Raiden turns up. Even then, the combat is just pretty boring compared to Injustice. I don't know if I'll eve get back into this game. Very disappoint with it from day 1 to now. 




 That's what I believe, yes. I've not seen anything that's convinced me otherwise. 




 People don't just start to say things like that.

Yes they do. People see things in the sky that they can't identify, some people think it's alien ships, I think they're mistaken.

There's so many things these people could have seen, at the end of the day they saw a UFO, the U meaning unidentified, meaning they don't know what it is, jumping to conclusions that it's aliens is silly.

I don't believe anyone has seen aliens visit Earth. I believe aliens exist, but not that they've been here. Based on the fact that we KNOW people lie, and we KNOW people are prone to being mistaken, and we KNOW our senses are easily fooled, and we haven't seen any verifiable evidence of aliens being here, I don't believe people who claim to have seen alien space ships have actually seen alien space ships. 




 I don't think I've ever been not ok with my own mortality. I don't want to die but I know it's going to happen, I just have to try to stave it off for a long as I can.

Where was I before I was born? That's where I'll be when I'm dead. 




 Depends on the girl I guess. Suspicion would probably be my first thought. 




 But what if you flew over somewhere you'd never been before and saw a creature you'd never seen before? Would you check them out or just go "huh" and keep flying? 




 True. But conversely you can have a bad film that has entertaining aspects such as the action. 




  Even if 50% of those are made up

What makes you think any of them aren't made up? 




 I believe aliens exist because it's pretty much a mathematical impossibility that this planet is the only one that has life on it.

I don't believe aliens have visited Earth. 




 And that's when it's time to play Bodies in your head and drop a bitch. It was an honest accident. The kid and skater collided, didn't look like anyone was in error either way, mother over reacts, punches a guy because women are untouchable right? Deserves a punch back IMO. 




 Triggered! 




 I suspect he may be misusing the word "mate". 




 I'm interested to hear what the woman of reddit has to say on the matter. I bet she's got some interesting opinions. 




 If I were going out with a girl and she later revealed she used to be a man I'd be pretty pissed off. That's the kind of shit that should be made clear beforehand. 




 Huh. And here I thought paths like that were laid by hand. This makes much more sense. 




 I saw Prometheus. His name doesn't carry a film for me any more.  




 Then I literally didn't see that part. 




 I'm not saying there's anything wrong with films made from books, not sure where you're getting the notion that I have a problem with that. It explains the hype I'm seeing. Before today I didn't know it was originally a popular book, knowing this pretty much answers the question posted in the title. 




  People feel as if too much attention was given to the human characters instead of the Transformers themselves.

Well I agree with you there. But I feel the films can still be enjoyable. 




 True Megan Fox didn't help IMO. But the explosions and changes never bothered me. 




 Nature in general is scary, the insect world is just fucked up. 




 It's not annoying me, it just looks kind of bland and pretty similar to Silent Runnings. Now I know it was a popular book beforehand (what isn't these days?) I can understand why people are excited about it. 




 I didn't say I didn't want to see it, I was just curious as to why it was making huge waves when there seems to be nothing new or unique about it at all, looks pretty similar to Silent Runnings to be honest. The fact that it was a popular book before this is news to me and goes a long way to explain the hype. 




 Yeah I didn't know it was a loved book already. I should have guessed though, everything seems to be adapted from a book these days. Thanks for the clarification. 




 Of course, what film isn't based on a book these days? I guess the book was popular even though I've never heard of it. Then again, I nevereven heard of Harry Potter until the first film was made. 




 I like the Transformer films, you know why? Because I like the Transformers, and I sometimes like to watch mindless action. People shit all over Bay's films because he likes to blow shit up, sometimes I want to see shit get blown up. There's always room for Whiplash, Birdman, The Theory of Everything. But there's also room for Transformers. Obviously the human elements of those films always suck balls and should be dropped from all future Transformer films, but I for one love watching giant robots beat the shit out of each other, and frankly I'm amazed that seemingly no-one else does.

How odd.

Transformers 2 is the obvious exception, that film can go die somewhere. 




 Can someone explain to me why this film is generating to much hype? It seems pretty cheesy to me. With cringeworthy lines like "Every human has the same instinct, the instinct to help each other out." and "I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this." I can't quite believe how much of a big deal people seem to be making of it, I must be missing some vital information.

Edit: The title is meant to read "...so much hype." not "...to much hype."

 I clicked the link, but before I could start reading the article a really obnoxious unmutable ad filled the screen.

Left that site without reading anything. 




 I like the way the blonde guy is like "Fuck this shit, I've seen this happen before." 




 [Here he is on the red carpet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMgXboVyxY0) 




 But it's coming. It's always coming.  




 Cars do have lights. But that doesn't mean people wearing black glow like lightbulbs when a cars lights are on them. If your main beams are on then yeah, they'll show up easier. But you'd be surprised how late you can see someone when they're walking in the dark and dress dark, on the road, with no reflective articles whatsoever. It's asking to be killed.  




 "Every human being has the same instinct. To help each other out."

Yeah, apart from all the ones who don't have that instinct. I hope this opening line isn't indicative of the message this film is going to try to portray. 




 I know. I have a fear of bees and I actually squirmed a couple of times watching this.

But I was facing my fear! So I'm a man!      ...right? 




 I approve of your username, even if you are kind of hard to find. 




 I guess you were lucky in so much as you had a great deal of empathy. Perhaps you were treated badly and thought "This is shitty, I'd never do this to another person." Some people just go "Oh, this is normal behaviour. I've got no problem being an asshole to other people." 




 I'm sorry to hear that but glad that he's doing well given the situation. 














 Back when I was playing this games I used Deathstroke, Doomsday, and Wonder Woman as my silver team. Pretty beast. 




 Your crazy cat lady is showing. 




 More like replacing the Puffin. This is just another meme where people are going to voice their disliking of certain things or types of people. 









 Maybe not blasted over and over and over, but kids to usually have to be taught right from wrong, that being mean to other people is wrong, and being nice to other people is, well... nice. 




 I wouldn't believe anything written on a website called psychic101.com lmao. In order for me to answer your question I'd have to think such a place exists in the first place, why do you believe it exists? 




 [Relevant](http://media.balls.ie/uploads/2014/01/Rocky.jpg) 




 Some people don't. I almost never skip them. It's always cool when you meet someone else who wants to see it as well. 




 define astral plane please. 




 I don't watch these videos that give away the dialogue. I'd much rather wait until the character's released and see them in person while playing ranked matches. 




 Wow, you'll have to be more specific than "those skinny models". Some pictures/examples would be helpful.

I don't like skeletons and I don't like huge fat women. Does that answer your question? 




 Don't look for logic in racism. 




 I was told I had to preorder GTAV to get access to the blimp. I preordered it 8 months before release to make sure I'd get a copy (this was back when I thought games could still sell out). I was standing in line with my Xbox 360 preorder but changed my mind to PS3 when my friend finally told me he was going to get it. So I picked up a PS3 copy, minus a pre-order, and I still go the blimp.

This was when I realised pre-ordering games was literally a waste of time. 




 I think it's more the fact that he made a pretty racist remark, but is still employed.

Could you imagine if a white professor had called predominantly black colleges "Black Chocolate Bumfuckery Township" and he kept his job? 




 Magic, next question. 




 Not worth it then IMO. 




 Record it on my phone and observe it. 




 "Its about how ridiculousness in love I am with you."

WAT?
