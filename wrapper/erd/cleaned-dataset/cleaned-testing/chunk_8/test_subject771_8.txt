 SWIM got laughed at on the phone.  Twice. 




 I want to race my truck, not a bike.   




 I just tried.  I got laughed at on the phone.  She didn't know what I was asking, so I told her about top gear and how they race on tarmac, and there's no track around here, so how much would it cost to rent the tarmac for an afternoon?  They won't let me do that.  That was sort of embarrassing getting laughed at by the lady at the aeroport. O.o.   




 Damn it.  How hard would it to be to rent the airport runway for an afternoon? 




 Not totally soft, just not rock hard.  You have to be able to bend your dick.  Like think of the hottest person you can think of, and then half erect, think of your grandma.  Push it in, and go to town. :) 









 I don't either, but 290 HP on a 350 that I dropped in with dual quads. :)  I have more power than I know what to do with. :)

 LOL!  It's been a long time since I've heard that joke! :D :D 




 I can do that too. :D

 I was on acid, but my end table turning into this strange machine that had gears and pulleys, and wheels and belts, and ramps and belts, and there were a bunch of 2" tall people running around making this machine work.  I couldn't figure out what the hell they were making, or what the machine was supposed to do, but it was the coolest thing I ever saw.  LSD is a hell of a drug, and you can see some amazing shit that is mind boggling.

**EDIT:**  I couldn't figure out what the hell they were doing, but I didn't try to engage and just watched it trying to figure out what the hell they were doing.  Whatever those mini-people were doing, they looked busy, so I didn't want to disturb them.  I had this thought of "Woah, what if this is how power really works?" and was looking for wires, but couldn't find any.  Since I couldn't figure out what the hell they were doing, I just watched. 20m later *poof* gone.  Then I decided to walk outside, and I "felt the gas station".  That was the coolest thing I ever felt. :) 




 *cough* pullman wa *cough* 




 *checks wallet*

Nope, not INS. 




 Is that even available to free members?  From what I hear, the A-List thing isn't really worth it. 




 Travel to a city

Therein lies the problem.  I just filled up, and my truck gets 11.9 MPG. 




 I was up at Stateline about 10 years ago, and they let you race if you have a seatbelt, (or not if your rig was made before 63 or so), and have a $10 bill for admittance for an hour.  I just called the LC airport to see if they'll let me use a runway for an afternoon. :)  That's really the only option I have if I want to keep it off the streets.  I got that idea from Top Gear.  They race on aeroport tarmac, so maybe I can too?  IDFK?  Worth a shot though.

I saw a jetcar explode, and a stock car race.  Watching a high speed collision live is a hell of a lot different than on TV.  I saw that car flip 5 times and land on it's wheels.  The crowd was silent as a grave.  I wanted to see cars go fast, not have a wreck and get towed out after the EMT's and the fire truck came out and made sure the dude was alive.  O.o  I didn't have enough balls to get on the track after seeing that.

**EDIT:**  And now you know why I get into street drags on occasion, but after seeing a couple of videos on this forum, I don't want to do that anymore because even if I was Dale Earnhardt, shit happens.  I remember that race too.  I want to keep it off of the street. 




 Life.  It doesn't matter if you're a billionaire without any heirs when you die. 




 Marry an asian chick, and have fun for like ever.  I could introduce her to t-bone steaks, mashed potatos, and corn on the cob, and greenbeans, and keystone ice.  She could introduce me to whatever they eat over there, and we'd have fun, and go hiking at the butte, and go fishing, and generally have fun. 




 I'm not one anymore, but in my youth I did a lot of shit.

* Keep your car locked, most thefts are opprotunistic crimes.

* Take your keys with you, and roll up your windows.  I never took a rig without easy access to it.  (1998 camaros haul ass BTW)

* Make sure you have a secondary ignition interlock, even if they have a screwdriver and a a hammer, it's not going to do much good if they can't find the secondary ignition switch.

* Surprisingly enough, a push button and a ignition toggle lever.  Most thieves (well kids), want to have a good time, and not jack your rig.  They won't be able to figure it out, and will leave you alone even if they do gain access.

* keep your rig clean on the interior.  Messy car = easy target.  Nobody's really going to notice if I'm driving a broken down ford that looks like a rolling trash can with a broken ignition switch. 




 I'm in pullman WA, and feeling "the need for speed again", but I'm too old to get into a street drag, (and I don't really want to spin out of control and kill somebody).  Anybody know of any closed roads around, or a track? 




 Do you know if there is a track around here?  I'm feeling "the need for speed", but I'm too old to get into a street drag.

 Either VGH or R-Tech systems.  Both places know what the hell they are doing.  They have parts.  I went to R-tech back in 2005 because I didn't have a spare MB and processor, so I took it to them.  6 hour turn around time.  I was impressed, so I let them fix it.  Oh, if you tell them not to touch a HDD, they'll physically disconnect it so you don't have to worry about being spotted for being a movie pirate with over 500G of film. :) 




 I ... um ... what? O.o  I'm confused. 




 We have exactly 1 sit down resturant with asian food in town, and it sucks pretty bad.  I mean besides Tokyo Seoul.  I'm not even sure what they're trying to pass themselves off as. 




 Because I want to try some asian food, and I think the local one resturant is shit, so I'm hoping that I could introduce them to Tbones and mashed potatoes, and corn on the cob, and green beans, and they can introduce me to hot shit that is good from wherever they're from.  When I say "recent", i mean within the last 10 years.  Not so far away that they don't remember how to cook good shit, but not so recent that no english. 




 I guess I should has specified asians that are recent immigrants and live within 5 miles of my house.  White chicks are ok too, but I like asians better. 




 well, I already have that nailed down.  Do they like a specific look in mind, or is it a crap shoot? 









 7.5" of glory, or my body shape.  I'm 5'8", and exactly 130.0 lbs 




 I like that body shape.  If you were around me, you wouldn't need one of those. :)

 I wish I had a high horse, and a camaro too, and free cable TV, (well, I sort of have that because tools), and a reliable truck, and an owned house, and somebody who wasn't to busy for me even as an adult, and a chick too.

 No kid should ever have to utter the words that "daddy is too busy, he flew off to Detroit, and I'm living at home alone now for the next 3 weeks" when asked by the teacher  at 8 "Why didn't your dad come to the parent-teacher meeting?  Is something going on?"  I got a lot of free food those 3 weeks, and had a lot of chores to do but "I kept the hosue running", so I did a good job. 














 Yep.  Had the CSA not fired on Sumpter, it's likely that the USA would have just left and pulled the troops out.  It was a failed project from the start, but so was the USA prior to French intervention.  Had the British and French intervened on behalf of the CSA, history would have likely played out very differently, (and they almost did). 




 Yes they were.  They were also the first to institute the draft, and print "greenbacks" backed up by nothing, and to institute an income tax to fund the war effort, and rationing of goods to the civilian population.  They also had such a strict "defend the homeland" policy, that they rarely left their "territory".  Had they firebombed DC, they likely could have forced the north to come to terms of peace.  Sherman later did that to Atlanta in 1864-1865 during his "march to the sea".  

Preemptive strikes work, when done correctly.  Imagine the Union's reaction to WDC, NYC, Boston, and Phillidephia being razed to the ground.  It would have been humiliating to the northern efforts to contain the rebels, and likely would have worked. 




 Only because y'all fired on fort sumpter.  They were within 3 weeks of being starved out.  Had y'all not fired upon it, it's likely that you could have left, (and then failed). 









 You mean war of southern independence?  A civil war is where 2 or more factions are trying to control an existing government power.  If the war of southern independence was a civil war, so was the American revolution.  The difference is we won, and the south lost.  That's it. 




 I just think it's a symbol of a failed nationstate.  (because it is).  A failed revolution that had 13 "states", and couldn't fight for shit because they were so damned isolationist.  I wouldn't fly that flag, any more than I would fly the flag of the USSR.  It's gone folks.  At least the USSR existed for about 75 years.  The CSA was just piss in a windstorm.  When I see the confederate flag, I don't associate it with racism, I associate it with "somebody's mad that they lost".  Fuck, might as well flag of Yugoslavia for what the CSA flag represents. 









 
Want a good movie that deals with this?  [The Man From Earth](http://www.hulu.com/watch/517822)  I give it PG13 rating.  Not because of violent bloody scenes, but because I don't think a 13yo or younger would understand it.  Adult situations.  It's one of the best movies I've ever watched. 




 I could probably do 1000 years.  Hell, I've already lost all the people I really cared about except for one, so why not?  I'd like to see how society evolves over the next millennia, that would be sort of cool actually.

 I think I would rather just get my ass kicked than live with an eternity with .... literally nothing.  If I had my "bat belt" as my ex wife called it, I'd just pull out my gun and end it.  And it would be different than just not existing, because you're conscious the whole time and you can think of every waking moment.  Imagine looking out to see .... nothing. but you're fully conscious of it.  I'd be begging for my sidearm at that point, and I would only need 1 round.

**EDIT:**  You would go insane.  Look up sensory deprivation.  Most people can last about 72 hours from what I've researched.  I don't mean lock up, I mean total sensory deprivation.  That is the ultimate form of torture.  At least I've practiced for sucking dick by deep throating hot dogs.  (Yes, I know that's super gay, [esp when doing it in front of my dad and he questioned my sexuality]). 




 Until that one day that the last proton decays, and there's nothing left but you,  Alone, in the universe.  Everything ceases to exist outside of quantum particles, but you continue to live  .... forever ... with nothing to see or experience, or do.  Imagine being locked in your room as a kid when getting punished with no TV or radio or power.  Now make it last forever.  But there's no bed to lay in and cry, no walls, no floor.  Just nothing, and ... more of nothing.  Then it never ends  because it's .... forever.  Terrifying prospect to be left alone for ever with literally nothing but your thoughts. 




 [It's a chameleon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmcA9LIIXWw) You get it by coming and going, and stringing people along like in your golden dreams. :D 




 Can you imagine that?  "The Last Perfect Day", and then it gets hotter, the sun gets brighter, and then it becomes insufferably hot, and then all of the organic matter around you starts wilting and dying off, then spontaneous combustion becomes a very real thing, then the world literally catches fire., then the atmosphere is blown off into space, and all of the water on the planet.  Plate techtonics break down because the surface is molten, and the planet it turned into a ball of molten rock, and then completly engulfed by the Sun, and vaporised.  

The only trace of the Earth left would be a slightly higher iron and sulphur and sodium content in the sun.  Then the sun collapses, and earth is gone forever, (and venus and mercury).  Mars would likely survive as a burnt out husk like mercury is today, and the rest of the planets would be unaffected.  I think I would rather just shoot myself. 




 Want to be alive when the sun engulfs the Earth in about 5 billion years, want to live to see the sun get so large that the atmosphere is blown away into the vacuum of space, the oceans boil off, and the mountains melt? Then the sun expands, and engulfs the earth, only to vaporize it? And you get to see it all? Living to see everything you ever known, cared about, and ever seen, just engulfed and obliterated by the dying sun?

How about in a googolplex years, when the very atomic structure of the Universe ceases to exist.  Not even electrons would exist, and the only thing existing would be some photons, some quantum particles and you?  Alone, forever, in a universe with nothing, and you still live on.  That would be hell, knowing that the entire universe you know and are familiar with is obliterated, but you keep on living on ..... forever.

I think I would rather eat a bullet than see that. I take solace knowing I will never exist to see that day. The thought of eternal life is far more terrifying than knowing that yes, one day, I just stop existing. 




  I wish ... I'd live forever

Really?

 We all die.  Shit happens.  It's unavoidable.  It's nothing to be feared, after I die, I won't even exist, so why fear what I can't feel, sense, taste, or touch?  Might as well feat the Space Jews stealing all the moon money.  It just makes no sense to fear death.  Hell, my house could collapse on me right now and crush me under a couple of hundreds of tonnes right now.  The USSR could launch now, and vaporise me in 45m.  Why fear what I can't control?

To put a reverse on an old country song, it's not the thought of being dead, it's the thought of dying that is sort of frightening.  If the soviets launch, well, I won't feel a damned thing.  I'll just be non-existent one millisecond.  If my house collapses for some reason, I might be trapped for several days before expiring.  I think I would rather die in a thermonuclear explosion. 




 Handjobs and blowjobs seem to get the highest reviews. :) 




 I ... don't even know how that works.  I think you got it backwards there dude.  O.o 




 Called out behind the pump house and beat so bad that I couldn't move.  Yeah, getting "behind the woodshed" is a very real thing in rural communities.  And then getting punched because you're crying like a little bitch, and told not to tell anybody or it will only be worse, and shaking because you're crying so hard and just want it to stop.  Yay childhood, I guess.  I'd slap me, but I think that was completely uncalled for. 




 That was the first time I was let loose on my own with a tank and a torch.  I got told to "go burn weeds", so I did.  I ended up burning a lot more than the weeds in the ditch.  I fucked up.  I admit it.  Thanks for making me cringe and reflexively cower down for 2s, dad. :(  You try costing the ranch $1.4M, and lost wages for your men for 2 years. 




 I **think** I had a good reason to get my ass kicked.  I cost the ranch almost 2 years of working salary.  Never give your kid a blowtorch, EVER.  Esp one hooked up to a 5ga propane tank, and you cost the ranch quite a bit of money.  Explosions aren't fun when you're running from it resulting a fire that you were told to start. O.o 




 Yes, it was, that's why I got hit.  We lost 3 cattle and one combine.  All because "Hey, let's let a 14 year old kid have a blowtorch and put him on weed control in late august".  Yeah, I fucked up, but the should have never handed me the blowtorch in the first place.  I wouldn't give my daughter a blowtorch with a propane tank and say "go kill weeds".  Why did they? 




  I started a field fire because I was trying to burn off some weeds, and it got out of control. That was a $1.4M loss to the ranch. I deserved it.  3 cattle, and one combine were lost in that fire, (and a couple hundred acres of wheat).  I fucked up.

Yeah!  Let's trust a 14 year old kid with a blow torch in late august.  That's a good idea!  (not)

 Which is why it should be reinstated, but specifically targeted to prevent incompetent people from voting.  Race should not be an issue.  Black people are just people like you and I.  Hell, for all I know you're black,  I honestly don't give a shit about race at all.  However, incompetent people should be prohibited from voting. 




 I know.  It has probably happened.  I'm not against competency tests, but they should be in English at a 12th grade level of comprehension.  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 had good intentions, (prohibiting discrimination based upon race as a requisite to voting), but it had the unintended consequences of "Let idiots vote too!".  Did you know that now, a completely illiterate down's syndrome person has as much sway in national politics as you and I?  I'd be for in favor of repealing the 26th amendment, and returning the voting age to 21 years of age. 




 I'm familiar with that joke, (that isn't to far off).

A black man walks into the sheriff's office to register to vote in Alabama.  He goes to pass the literacy test.

The Sheriff says "Can I help you son?"

The black man says "Yes sir, I came to pass my literacy test to vote."

The sheriff hands him a newspaper in Chinese, and asks the black man "Can you read that?"

The black man looks at the paper and sadly states, "Yes sir, I can.  It says here that "No niggers going to vote in this county."  He turns and walks out the door after setting down the paper on the sheriff's desk. 




 Yes.  A person should need to pass a US Citizenship test before being allowed to vote.  If you don't know how your government works, I honestly think you deserve no say in how it is run.

*"An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people."*

 Human trafficking. That is a fucking horrible crime, and the perpetrators should be shot in the face. 














 Only 32 years old, but my "best gift" that I ever got was a meal that I didn't have to cook.  It was from my step mom, and I was mind boggled that she even thought of that.  I know she knows that I don't like cooking, but that was nice.  I wasn't expecting it at all. 




 I'm 32.  Nope.  I should have been in vegas by now, with a paid off house and a 3 year old paid for truck. 




 Not be such a pillock in my HS years, and end up married to my HS crush.  Also, not drop out of school after 9/11, and refuse to re-enroll in college.  Not drink and drive, avoid debt like the plague.

 The Hanson brothers. 




 I didn't have my truck with me, so I "stole" the buggy.  If I had my truck on my store run, I wouldn't have kiped it in the first place.  Or do you mean on the way back?  Because I didn't think of it?  "buggies have wheels, so I can tow it" is all I was thinking. 




 Since there's no "Ask a PO" thread, do you like looking at dude's junk while giving a UA, or is it part of the job?  And why back in 2008 was I told to disarm before going into the can?  If I wanted to shoot you, I wouldn't wait until the can to do it. 




 It's not a good idea to shoot automatic weaponry from the road into the field because you're testing it.  Do it from your own land where it's safe. 




 Nope.  I don't even have a functional door bell.  Knock. 









 Get naked in front of a mirror, gently fellate yourself, while tenderly fingering your hole, and softly weep. 




  I was listening to the scanner, and I heard, "We found 191 shells, but no clue where they came from"  I heard radio chat about trying to find the guy, (me), but "we can't pin it down, there's no other reports of FA fire countywide".  Me and my dad kept quiet.   We saw the SWAT van come and leave, and stayed up just watching them roll on by.  All because somebody in a 98 Camaro called the cops om me. (according to the scanner).  Needless to say, I got the fuck out of dodge. 




 I honestly think bill said "fuck it", because for something that I don't know why that the red and blues were turned on.  I honestly don't know why he was getting stopped.  But he outran it, and after hiding a while, we just went home.  He also rolled up on me for firing a AKS on a rural road.  Umm, oops.  He just lectured me about not discharging my rifle on public roads, and I might want to leave now because the sheriff was coming over in a SWAT van to investigate reports of FA fire.  I left.  Fuck this.  They didn't find anything. :D  I guess getting reports of some dude standing in the middle of the road waving cars by and firing into a field doesn't go over too well. O.o

**EDIT:**  I had a police scanner at the time. 




 A man is a man as far as I'm concerned.  Want to be gay?  More power to you. I honestly couldn't care less.  It makes no difference to me (other than more chicks for me).  So how did it come to represent the "homosexual movement", and not just "I don't care what race/color/sex/sexual orientation you are". 




 Nope. I haven't smoked for like 5 weeks now.  Pot isn't that great. (yay for being legal in WA, I guess?) 




 I honestly don't give a shit if you're not gay for me.  Just like I wouldn't some random chick hitting on me, I don't want dudes to either.  You like men?  I honestly don't care.  But I don't think I'll fly that flag ever, because people might get the wrong idea why I'm flying it.  I would only fly it to signify "I don't care", not because I'm gay. 




 Maybe.  I've seen Alaskan State Troopers, yeah, he always gets caught, but it is conceivable that they would be able to find a way out.   My dad told me about his adventures in the 70's, and he seemed to get away quite a lot.  He ouran bill once when I was with him. (we had 4wd, he didn't so my dad took off across the fields and got away).  I thought it was cool when I was 13.  We parked next to a diesel truck in some random barn and waited for 45 min. :)  We got out no problems. :)  He even went to the extent of following the tracks, and keeping in them so it looked like the truck made it.  We hid in the rafters. 




 So cops basically walk behind somebody the same reason I do?  (self preservation, and I can GTFO of the way if shit goes down) 




 So why did the cop follow me to my car the one time that I got mixed up with a prowler, and he wanted me to show him my rigs?  It made no sense, but I complied.  He wanted to see what I owned, so I showed him.  I didn't get it.  I actually said "these are keys, it's not a knife or a gun or anything".  That was the strangest encounter ever.  I didn't even know why they thought I was a prowler.  I was just sitting on my porch drinking beer and listening to my radio.  I was confused why they even looked at me, (and why I had to show them my rigs). 




 I know that, I don't let anybody behind me for that reason, but why not next to the side, and walk next to them on the opposite side where you carry your sidearm/knife?  ( I assume LEO carries a knife, because I do). 




 I honestly don't care if you're gay.  I like chicks, you like dudes.  Yay!  More women for me! :D  But why fly a flag at all, instead of simply not giving a shit?  I'm straight, and I know that not all chicks want to fuck me, or get down on her knees and suck me off.  Why are gays regarded as any different? 




 But wouldn't that give the dude they are following an advantage?  What's to stop him from just running and dive into nearby bushes? 




 Why not next to their side?  Wouldn't that give a better tactical advantage if they decided to run or whatever? 




 I guess I should have specified "homosexual". 




 If that's the case, why not fly it to say "I don't care whether you're black or asian, or gay.  I don't give a shit"?  Instead of it being exclusive to the "gay movement"?  If I flew a rainbow flag, people wouldn't think "I accept diversity in population", they would think I'm gay. 









 I kiped a buggy, because I had to walk home 2 miles, and there's no way I'm going to haul 15 bags of groceries around with me.  Yes, I returned it the next day.  That had to be a sight to see me driving back with it.  A truck with a buggy hooked up to the hitch, and driving 35 to the store. :D  I bet whoever was behind me was wondering why I was towing a buggy. :D 




 When she's crushing your hand squeezing out the kid, do like you would with a man, and meet force with force.  As they squeeze tighter, you squeeze tighter.  Failure to do this will only give you a fucked up hand, and you're not going to hurt her.  I had to grip back on so tight that my fingers were turning white, but I was uninjured, (and so was she).  You're going to need a pretty strong grip.

 Just be understanding.  Boys can be bullied by girls, and even 14 years later, it has cascading effects even in my daily life.

 dog damn it. :( 




 I'm serious.  Cars run over cigarette butts, what's so hard to understand about that? 




 I've been driving on the family ranch since I was 11 years old, and my dad even let me use his low ride.  So since 1994.  I pulled up to my grandpa's the first time, and he said "Does your dad know you're using his rig?  Is he going to hit you?"  I said "nope, he just said don't take it off the ranch, and I'm not.  He won't hit me if I don't take it on the public roads".  My grandpa just said "OK, be careful, and don't wreck!"  But he didn't care after that.  He knew I would show up in my dad's low ride 1972 Chevy Luv with a 3 speed tranny. :) 




 Oh hell no.  I throw it out, as in the middle of the street where cars will run over it, so not a problem anymore.  The cars will put it out for me, and smash it into little bits.  No litter. 




 Whenever you ride a dyke, always wear a condom.  You may prevent a life. 









 Correct.  WWII would have likely never happened.  (or at around 1960 between the USSR and USA, but it would have been conventional since the atomic bomb would have not been developed in this ATL).  But if the USA remained COMPLETELY neutral in WWI, both the USA and USSR would have likely remained isolationist, so we might still be referring to WWI as "The Great War".  

Fuck, I feel like I'm on /r/HistoryWhatIf 




 Actually, I think it was US Intervention in WWI that caused WWII.  Had the USA honored both the german blockade of the UK, and UK's blockade of mainland Europe, (no trade at all, we completely stay out), WWII would have been completely avoided. 














 No shit, use a dash mount, and have it direct wired using one of those tape adapters, and just use it like a stereo.  That's how I have my phone set up when I do use it as a jukebox.  But I only change the station when I'm stopped, (or waiting at a red light). 




 You're actually right.

 I just call that "putting out a cigarette where something flammable might be".  Other than that, I'll just crush it under my boot, or throw it out, (if I know there's no flammable material around) 




 Assist in station to station calls, collect calls, emergency disconnect of a phone in use so you can call them, get you to dispatch before 911 existed, look up phone numbers for you, authorize payphones by listening for the "bong" sound of a dime or quarter being dropped in, etc. 




 WWII might have never happened, if only Henry Tandy took that shot in WWI. 




 /r/politics would be sucking LBJ's crippled dick. 




 I was driving legally in 1999. 




 How the hell do you field strip a cigarette butt? 




 Money. 




 Walmart, Amazon, Big Smoke. 




 Because of bad grandma. 




 People who cruise along in the left lane. KEEP RIGHT EXCEPT TO PASS! It's not only courtesy, it's the law! 




 DOW Chemical, and Dupont. 




 Shaniqua, Keenzel, Kacey (for a dude), Andrina, Dawn, Shawn (for a dude), Monique. 




 What if the ride is 50 minutes, and the passengers are a car-pool of workers just trying to go to work, calling their boss because of traffic?  Should the vehicle have to come to a complete stop before they can make any call, and force them to either come in late, or be tardy because they can't pull back into traffic safely?  16 year olds work, eh? 




 That would infringe on the passenger's convenience to make a call.  They aren't driving. 




 Yes, but if "disabled after a certain speed/below an age" were implemented, how does the system know?  I was 15 when I placed that call. 




 And hyponatremia. 




 Wouldn't work.  What if the passenger needs to make a call?  What if, like in 1998 when I was coming up the lewiston hill, somebody coming the other way down flashes his lights at you because you think there is a cop ahead, so you slow down; then you come around a corner and A VEHICLE IS HEADING RIGHT FOR YOU ON A DIVIDED HIGHWAY! 

I cut off a semi, and picked up on my phone, and called 911 to let them know about it, then got on my CB (chan 9), and let "ALL HEADING SOUTHBOUND ON US 95!  ALL HEADING SOUTHBOUND ON US 95!  THERE IS A LARGE VEHICLE HEADING NORTH IN THE SOUTHBOUND LANES ON THE LEWISTON HILL!  I REPEAT!  THERE IS A LARGE VEHICLE HEADING IN THE SOUTHBOUND LANES TO NORTH!  DIVIDED HIGHWAY!!"  

Within 10s of my call, I could hear the sirens behind me.  That was a legitimate emergency, so you bet your fucking ass I'm using my phone and CB!

Yes, I missed him by less that 30 feet.  That was fucking scary.  Had it not been for my phone and radio, who knows how large that accident would have been.  Technologically prohibiting cell phone use in a moving vehicle isn't a solution, education is. 




 I came across it, and I had to turn it off.  My wife was texting and driving with me in the car.  If she was my daughter, I would have taken her damned phone and thrown it out the window.  I made my wife watch it.  She went white at the head on scene, and started crying at the kid asking mommy and daddy to wake up, and almost puked at the dead baby scene.  I'm thinking about taking her to a wrecking yard and seeing in person what happens when you text and drive.  Somebody in HS did that to me when she heard I was racing on busy public streets.  I got drug out to her truck, and she forced me to actually open up the vehicle and take a look inside.  She then shoved my head in and "smell that?  That's death.  That's what you're causing by racing on US195!  Keep up what you're doing, and you're going to be smelling this!  You will be the cause! This vehicle was going 131 on US195!  Do you want to see who they hit?"  All I could say was "no." and sounded like a child that just got beat by his mom.  I was crying at that point, and she drug me back to her truck and we went back to school.  I never raced on the highway again.  (I'll race on empty ones, but not that one, it's just too busy, and I might kill somebody).  There's nothing like the smell of curdled blood and some hair and skull to remind you DON'T RACE ON OPEN ROADS!.  I got hit after she heard about that, and I deserved it.

**TL;DR:** DON'T RACE!  DON'T TEXT AND DRIVE! 




 You asked for it (NSFW)  "I want mommy and daddy to wake up!"  How do you like seeing dead babies? 

Since you asked:

In some states, it's "Exhibition of Horsepower" 




 "What happens in this house stays in this house. Yes, mommy might hit you, but you don't want her to die in jail do you? Just keep quiet how we discipline you. You deserve everything you get. Now be a good boy and don't make your mommy mad, and you won't get hit anymore. It's OK, daddy's here. Just be good. hugs "We'll get some concealer to cover the bruises before school tomorrow. Just don't tell anybody, OK? You love your mommy don't you? I love you, son." closes door

Gee sound familiar?

  Maybe if she was black...


You mean mulatto? 




 united


yoondd

adjective

joined together politically, for a common purpose, or by common feelings

----------------------------------------------------------------------


union

yoonyn

noun

the action or fact of joining or being joined, especially in a political context


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The terms are interchangeable.
 




 United = Several States in a Union.  We are on the Americas.  Therefore, The United States of America. 




 Alcoholics under going DT's experience tactile hallucinations, (and meth heads)  "ants crawling under my skin".  That would be a tactile hallucination. 




 Have you ever heard of Schizophrenia? They "hear voices that don't seem to be there in person".  That is an auditory hallucination. 




 Yes.  Look up auditory hallucinations, and tactile hallucinations.  You can even "taste sounds".  Look up synesthesia.  




 No, because of that's what the Several United States of America are called.  (before that, we had the Articles of Confederation.  The constitution was ratified in 1791). 




 I don't think physical operators exist outside of calling (area code) 555-1212.  (I think the kids call it 411).  I know what they used to do, but I don't think they exist anymore. 




 Like I was her own kid.  She was raising me since I was 2yo, and I would rather run to my step mom than my birth mom for help.  My sister and I were the only kids "she ever had".  She got pregnant in 1998 because she wanted a "kid of her own", but changed her mind 6 weeks into it, because "I already have kids".  

My birth mother is fucking useless, but my step mom stepped in several times in grade school and raised hell because I was coming home with marks on me.  She told my dad to stop sending me over to joe's house because he would beat me.  My step mom basically **WAS** my mother, and did all of the things moms do, and dad did what dads do.  

My birth-mother was a negligent parent, and had no reason to even have me for once a week until I was 7.  Although I call her by her first name, she's "mom" to me.  There are billions of people called "mom", or "mum", but only one XXXXX in my mind.  So I call her by her first name, (and have all my life), as a sign of respect.  She only slapped me twice. 




 No.  Their visual cortex has not developed sight, and wouldn't know how to process it.  All of the other hallucinations would still be there. 




 Not to mention the extermination of life sustaining heat from emergency camp fires, and landslides and sink holes. 




 My father made me pay my own insurance.  Because I used to be hell on wheels in my 1977 Chevrolet Impala Coupe, (that I dropped a 350 in with dual quads, Yay 4MPG!) I had so many speeding tickets, and "Excessive display of horsepower" tickets that I paid $169/mo in insurance, and had a probationary license.  (I was getting stopped about once every 3 months).  I rolled my car when I was 14 years old, (been driving on the family ranch since 12), and got into my head on collision at 16 years old. 




 And accidental burns, and most kitchen accidents, and slips, trips, and falls in both the workplace and home. 




 That explains it!  Thanks! :) 




 And it can be directly linked to hypothermia, and hypothermia. 




 And also if you're broke down along the highway, they'll change your tire, or give you a gallon of gas, or give you a ride into town.  I know police have utility beyond speeders (or dui busts), on the highway, but I'm asking about how they used to monitor speed before radar guns existed. 




 Everybody who has ever consumed dihydrogen monoxide is now dead, or will die.  Everybody who doesn't consume dihydrogen monoxide, is either dead, or will be dead within 4 days. 




 Back in 2000 in my home town, a family of 3 was killed because a teenager was fucking with his radio.  The chick looked down for 2 seconds, and smashed through a 93 Geo Metro at 60. 




 LOL! :D  I was driving an 1989 Ford Mustang LX at the time. :D 




 Only when nobody is around though.  It's not like I do it in rush hour traffic, or even if I can see one car around.  (except when in an emergency, but then I blare my horn, and turn on my 4 ways, and go directly to the hospital). 




 So, did they just drive around in circles all day, or??  How would this work?  Did they just go after vehicles that looked like they might be speeding? 




 I live in a duplex.  I have 3 bedrooms, and 2 baths.  I have 2 designated parking spots, and W/S/G included with the rent.  I use one of the bedrooms for a shop, and the other bedroom is completly empty.  I even keep the door shut to that room, and the vent is shut off in that room.  I have 2 floors.  The bedrooms (and 1 bath), are upstairs; and the living room, "dining room" (that I just use to make my living room bigger), kitchen, laundry room, and small downstairs bathroom are located downstairs.  I live in what would be classified as a semi-urban area.  I'm on College hill in Pullman WA. 









 1040 square feet.  I'm living by myself here with my cat.  I used to have a wife and a SIL that lived with me.  But I'm divorced now, and my Ex-SIL moved in with my Ex-wife. 




 "No daddy! Not my bum bum bum!"

"shhh billy let your daddy do his job"

gags you with his hand, and silently pumps away

"You like that Billy, don't you?"

forces your head to make the "yes" motion, and goes faster and puts a cowboy hat on your head

"WOO"

Slaps your ass with the side of his pillock and gives you a mushroom print on your ass, then kisses you on the cheek, and goes even faster pumping away

"WOO!"

You just got raped by Rick Flair, and he's your dad. :D 









 Yes, I used to be a racer.
