 What the hell does Mouthwash really even do then, if not to substitute brushing for those inconvient days? 




 Only problem I see with this clarification, great job on that btw, is that Blacks are not the only ones not getting their 'food'. Let's not pretend for one second that only black minorities are the only victims in society. 'All lives matter' to me means that, sure blacks are at a disadvantage to a certain extent but so are muslims (who probably have it worse in the USA), sikhs, Latinos, and any other minority that don't even have prominent leaders within the culture or the ability to come together and address problems they face in society. They all get swept under the rug which I can't stand to see. 




 You ever get the really dry shits that just won't be easily wiped and you just keeping going in to wipe and there is always some shit to be wiped. Next thing you know you, you've been sitting on the toilet wiping for 30 mintues. 




 I wouldn't say I'm religious per-say, but I do believe there is a 'God' (physical being or not) in some form or fashion. Isn't it crazy that we as humans, planets, and universe exist. I mean the universe had to have spawned from something, right? (God or Big Bang) But, how did that something come into existence for it create the universe? and it just becomes a vicious cycle that is impossible to fathom. We are something from nothing...literally, which defies any and all laws of this world that I know of. Truly, mind-blasting that a relatively new-born species can even have the cognitive ability to recognize or contemplate it's own world's creation and stem away from the programmed 'Eat, Survive, Procreate' that all animals have. 




 I'm not Christian, so I'm not informed on this topic, but weren't Adam and Eve the only ones alive where ever they lived. First two humans, allegedly. Were there millions of people during this time?  




 Got to get them AR points any way I can. 




 I would explain myself but I was traumatized after watching it and have since forgot the premise but I do remember thinking that the story was either poorly put together or non-existent. Never felt anyone was in real danger. Hell, I don't even remember who the villian was, so that should say something in itself.

 Ironman 1 was good. 




 Well, how's that true is Woody and Murkah, 2 of 3 host hate Civ talk, and the guest most likely won't even know what Civ is. Not only that but it's the same convo everytime when they do talk about it. 




 Chase scene (On foot) from the movie 'Takers' 




 Have an upvote. 




 Well, he is on reddit. 




 You have to do Buck Angel or Bailey Jay. Choose Wisely. 




 ....M. Night Shyamalan...is that you? 




 ;) 




 Breakout Kings. On netflix right now, go watch and be sad along with me that it was cancelled. It concludes the story so you won't be watching for no reason. (Didn't get enough viewers to sustain the show.) 




 What's it about? 




 All businesses 




 Time Travel. All your life's problems solved. 




 Fuck leaving, lets kill it! Cliche 




 My light wont work 




 Kids who apparently have inter-dimentional and supernatural connection. 




 Moving into an old house, in which someone has previously died in. 




 Running in the woods and trips over a twig. 




 Hide in the closet, looking out the slight opening as antagonist searches for them. 




 "Red Eye" by Big KRIT gives me chills and I've never been in a tough relationship like that. It takes REAL artistry to make me feel like I've experienced what the artist has. And the way he tell the story of this situation while rhyming and staying on beat is amazing. Not to mention that the instrumental, especially the piano backbone is so powerful even on its own. 




 Captain Underpants was pretty good in my young adult days...maybe some Junnie B Jones. 




 1984 




 I just want to be given reddit gold one time. That is why I come back. 




 The Star Wars Prequels. Never been the same since. 




 Files will be declassified in 2017! 




 Confirm Half-Life 3 




 Just throw the word quantum in the sentence a few times and people will zone out immediately. 




 Pretty sure the hosts don't want to fly over to New England to just to hit up Six Flags. 




 No bro.
