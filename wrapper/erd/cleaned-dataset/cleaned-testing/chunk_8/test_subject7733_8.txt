 When you are also a black woman 




 Nat Geo Wild is amazing, I wish they would do a full week of animal fight night! You guys need to check that show out, they don't skimp out on blood or anything and show animals and their battles in the wild. Sorry I comma splice and run-on. 




 I mean I like playing League with my friends more than I do solo, but it's not my passion. 




 Still enough money in the sport to be an alternative to anything else where the rewards are immediate 




 Not necessarily, I don't even know how you'd even begin to measure that.  Benoit Assou Ekotto is a professional footballer (soccer player; just for clairification) that doesn't like playing at all. He once showed up to the stadium on game day and asked his coach who they were playing! [Playing for the money excerpt](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/01/benoit-assou-ekotto-tottenham-hotspur) 




 Damn, I'm living around ATL and I totally missed out. Love listening to some of their morning show stuff on my way to work. 




 You're right, 6 months was more a less arbitrary time I picked to denote that the present sucks. I'm not even a fan of the animals, I'd actually be happy if I didn't have to see them. It's just better than all this drama and misused power 




 /r/retiredgifs  




 God damn I just want the reddit of 6 months ago!! The reddit where I didn't have to see Ellen pap everywhere, or news of how Bernie sanders now manages to have 7 voters instead of 6! I want a reddit where the most infuriating thing I saw on it was an overflow of cute animal pics on the front page. Oh how reddit is pulling out all the stops to fuck themselves over. I feel like /r/pinkfloyd needs a contingency plan for when everything goes tits up. Because this is a really good niche community and it'd be a shame if we lost it. 




 lol nerds dont get hip lingo 




 Instead he kept it exclusively for his own women and people! 




 yeah but who wants to link their facebook? 




 Idk, but I found that to be a major pain in the ass as well. My buddy just got back into League, hes level 23, and we couldn't duo bot at first because he didn't really own an support champs. Until he bought cheap Alistar 




 Ahh I see, it's more or less an interpretation of policies/models that favor or facilitate the more wealthy? That's a general observation, but your definition was good, and makes me look at it in a different light. Thanks. 




 Nien needs to work on those high fives, holy hell 




 POUNDS SCHILLINGS AND PENCE! Perfect Sense is one of the highlights from an already amazing album 




 Can you point me to any papers or readings on supply-side economics and this so-called trickle down economics. I have a very brief knowledge of these ideas and you know your shit. So any recommendations of yours would be appreciated. 




 Short team, because everyone is saying tall, and i'm rooting for the little lads. Although that small of a goalie would be like watching women's world cup 




 Unless there's a point to be made, I'm always interested in learning something new about PF 




 Speak for yourself, you're the one walking along the roadside 




 Pretty much any song by Pearl Jam, and English is my native tongue 




 For me, this song has the 2nd best guitar solo in the whole album, behind Comfortably Numb of course. It can be debated obviously, but I love it. 




 Animals is the beginnings of prog rock, i dont see much if any psychedelics in it, maybe if you could reference a moment that'd be great. And The Wall is in a genre of its own in my opinion. 




 They have like 2/15 albums that could be considered psychedelic idk what he was talking about 




 Psychedelic? Maybe early on, I'd be hard pressed to call OBC, Animals,  DSotM, WYWH, Meddle, AHM, TFC, The Wall, TDB, and TER psychedelic  




 Endless River - Pink Floyd 




 Downvoted after reading #1, take this blatant childishness elsewhere. Not saying there's anything wrong with smoking, but what the hell is this post? 














 Yeah I know exactly what you mean. I get the same feeling too. I think it's getting more attention than it deserves in some respects too. 




 I mean they aren't banning it per se. Just not hanging it in front of the capitol building, which I think is the right call. If some redneck wants to put it on the back of his lifted F-150, so be it. I don't believe in censorship in most cases, and I don't see this as censorship. 




 No reason to believe. This leads me to Occam's Razor. The simplest solution is usually the correct solution. There's nothing I experience day-to-day that leads me to believe that one exists. 




 I understand why people make the argument to keep it. But the current fact is that the confederate flag was a flag of another country. It's like states still hanging the union jack flag. (This point was made by Glenn Beck and I think this is a good analogy) In the flag's current state, for me at least, it holds the connotation of racism, but that could be my misinterpretation. 




 It was on the sidebar of the video. I also saw in another thread that she had a history of manic behavior and was found with 4 different drugs in her system. 














 It freaked me out but then I watched the video explaining what someone thought really happened and it no longer seemed to give me the chills. 




 These are some of the moments that get all of your guys' adrenaline pumping and ready to take on the world. I have no idea what I would have done. Any of you have weapons? 




 What a bunch of idiots 




 That's also very surprising. If the young people of reddit didn't know any better, they'd think Bernie is the front runner. From what I've seen though, it seems like a lot of redditors are helping people wise up to Bernie. 




 Well when there's so many GOP candidates, it's no surprise really. How many voters actually know what half of the candidates stand for? 




 What? It seems like the article is taking the opportunity to turn this tragedy into a political attack.  The overblown title is attention grabbing and biased as well. Fuckin NYT. 




 I apologize, you didn't deserve that response brother. Just the inner Libertarian in me having to read the insatiable bone cone for Bernie Sanders news on reddit gets on my nerves. All your points are fair points and aren't that far fetched at all. Take it easy. 




 Delusional person  that /u/titsalmighty just mentioned 




 ayo aye 




 Marina and the Diamonds 




 They should also say when you get demoted so we can all laugh at that person 




 Listen to starlight  




 I like this one even more! I've experienced this multiple times, awesome! 




 Hmm. I've read Lord of the Flies and it didn't seem to have the same profound effect on me that others experience. 




 Very good points. There's a lot of get rich quick or dieting or business books that are meant as cash cows. I've never read Dune, always seemed very daunting. 




 Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction 




 My buddy was super smart and had a bunch of honors society medals. So I took them after he walked and wore them. I also had a soccer medal I won in 5th grade and a wrestling medal I got when I was 7. I also managed to get a cord from the Baseball team because they made their own.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that my picture was in the newspaper with all the medals on 




 How has it changed your day-to-day philosophy or lifestyle? What were you like before you read it? 




 Yeah but the moon is so slow that I thought maybe the oxygen bar would be worth it at this point. But you're right :'( 




 Their first two albums are more rock/grunge material. Not sure if you've heard those albums or not. 




 I don't agree with older Muse, but nothing off their 3 most recent albums is all that great. What stuff of theirs have you heard? 




 Don't go for The Wall, if Dark Side isn't your cup of tea, don't go to that album. I'm a huge fan of PF and I think that album isn't very accessible. The Division Bell is very listenable to as a casual fan. 




 Sufjan Stevens 




 Jealousy 




 Someone please take this thread down. No good discussion is going to come from it. Just incessant blabbering that people have heard a million times and are desensitizing the issue. I'm not saying we shouldn't talk about it, just this isn't the right forum. 




 I reset then bought the Oxygen bar upgrade and now I'm left with 330 million investors approx. and I've experience that it actually just set me back. FUCK 




 Take noobs to the wildy to find Santa, then kill them and take their mith armor. Make 5k gp an hour, rich 




 While holding a Vanity Fair magazine with Caitlin Jenner on the front 




 "There won't be any curves on the exam"

Bullshit. The average was a 52. I'll take my audacious curve and accept my 76. 




 God is real. 




 Two of the most impressive vocal PF performances of all time on one song. Roger's voice synthesizing with the saxophone seamlessly, and then the mind-blowing scream. Best song on TFC. 




 Sounds like you're using the voting system correctly 




 Admittedly I have plenty more that I haven't been able to listen to yet like Jaime xx among others. 

So far:

* Joywave - How Do You Feel Now?
* Twentyone Pilots - Blurryface -- probably my fan boy in me talking
* Noel Gallagher - Chasing Yesterday
* Brandon Flowers - The Desired Effect
* Lone Bellow - Then Came The Morning
* Houndmouth - Little Neon Limelight
* The Magic Whip - Blur
* Modest Mouse - Strangers To Ourselves

There may be others that I'm missing. What's your list look like? 




 I'll do the same if Mata scores against us 




 One of the few things I distinctly remember from the book. I had to read it for a critical analysis in HS, and was like WTF did i just read?  




 Spotify does have it's own radio feature akin to Pandora, albeit not as diverse, in my opinion. However, every Tuesday Spotify has most of the albums that are released available to listen to. And you can search through all the new releases and play an album to see if it's something you like. Also when you search a band, there are generally 5 artists on the side bar that are "recommended".


And if you don't like the radio stations. Spotify has entire playlists too that you can listen to. For instance, instead of an alternative rock station like Pandora, you can listen to a playlist instead. In the playlist you can see all the songs included and play them when you want.

Also it's so much easier on spotify to keep track of all the songs you've favorited and add them to playlists to revisit later


Sometimes I ramble and don't get my point across, let me know if I confused ya at all. 




 Our split into a separate faction on the pink Floyd subreddit has been initialized. 




 I don't think I voted for part 3, but I definitely would have before part 2 if that's of any condolence. 









 I was one of the five! *high fives the other four newly crowned best friends of mine* 




 Thanks for the advice with gadgets, also luckily I'm still young enough and in school so I'm still on my parents health insurance which is great. 




 Hmmm... This is very interesting, anywhere I can go to learn more? I don't want to go balls deep into something that I'm extremely nave to. Especially since I'd more than likely have to provide financial information to invest. 




 I would like recommendations with gadgets, modifications to cars, or anything that can pretty much improve my quality of life without costing all that much. Preferably nothing more expensive than $100 or $200. 




 How can you even tell what's not modified by effects? Like is that shit on her head actually there??? No fuckin clue m8 




 Haha best response! 




 Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd

Or

Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins 




 I appreciate it man 




 Yes this is perfect! Thanks so much! Can you link the thread too? 
 




 I've searched this subreddit but unfortunately could not find it, so this is the only reason I'm making a post like this on here. So sorry if this isn't the most appropriate way to approach this, but I could really use the help.


There was this craft/project done by a fellow redditor that did some type of wood burning onto a blank piece of wood that was the cover of Animals. It was amazing and I was going to have my girlfriend do one for me, but I couldn't find the post. The original post included links to a DIY website as well. 

Thanks to anyone that is album to help me! 




 Russell Crowe baby 




 Coincidentally listened to this today! One of the best songs on the album! 




 And then there are the days that get no comments. I got you track 8, nothin constructive however. 




 We are all witnesses, and I have no idea what I just fuckin witnessed. Holy shit, and then that Shumpert 3, talk about setting the tone.
