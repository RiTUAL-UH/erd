 The sliding rings clip to the headstall of the bridle.  The stationary rings are where the reins attach.  In my case, my top rein clips to the ring and the bottom rein runs through the ring and back to the saddle. 




 Wow, thank you!  That Bowman bit is the closest I've seen.  I'll send the link to my trainer and see if she'd like to get it. 




 I did look up Indian bits, but didn't find anything that similar.  :/

And as for the rust -- I'm sure that's part of it, but he really likes the fact that it's just a big straight bar and not jointed in any way.  If I could show him in it I would! 




 Hmm, I looked on ebay with no luck.  The Indian bits seem to be similar only because they have the extra rings.  I looked up thorn bits, but no dice there either -- many of them have crazy looking spiked ports.  The only one I've ever found close to it was in this bit collection on ebay:  http://i.imgur.com/ewAftSx.jpg  The third one down is very much the same, except with a slow twist instead of the ribs. I wish I could have afforded it. 




 My barn owns this bit and my horse is obsessed with it, as are many other horses in training.  It's his happy bit -- he works well in it, loves it, and we use it on him whenever its appropriate.  However, we only have one. My trainer pulled it out of some "big rusty bargain bin of bits" years ago and we have NO idea where to get another!  

Does anyone know what this kind of bit is called?  Has anyone ever seen one?  Do any of you own one?  It's a big 'ol mystery to us! 









 Well, just from this vector, I know I like you and would probably try to ask you out.  What does that say about good design?

 




 P.S. I was hoping you were a Redditor so I could tell you that!
 




 You are my hero!  Everyone I show the sign loves it.  My friends in Madison, my aunt in Atlanta, my mom in Illinois -- it's just the kind of humor we need when it's going to be this cold. 









 Uptown Theater, Minneapolis, MN.  They're a funny bunch. 









 Hello again friends, OP here.  Some of you have asked for a better description of her skills and so I've uploaded her resume for public viewing.  I did black out her name and address for now, so if anyone wants to contact her, simply PM me.  Again, many thanks to you all.  

https://www.dropbox.com/s/9cenx75tkrkwhko/JK_RESUME.pdf 




 Ladies and gents, my good friend finds herself without a job after this holiday season, and is having problems finding something new due to an odd looking resume.  In short -- after some medical issues took her out of the workplace for several years, she decided to become a horse trainer, which she did for several more years, until now.  Basically, she has an odd blank spot in her resume that employers don't like, and even after applying to 65+ jobs, has nothing to show for it.  

Preferences include some kind of receptionist/administrative assistant job, something in a law office, etc.  Really though, retail, sales, or whatever would work at this point.  Part time would be ok.  Things are going to get tough for her if she doesn't find anything soon and I don't know how else to help her than put the word out on here.

I can send a resume to anyone who is interested, or thinks their employer might be hiring.  She is smart and easy to like, and also hysterically funny.  If I could offer her a job I would, but I'm just not in that position right now.

Thanks Reddit, you're the best. 




 Single?  OP is a hottie.  Though, that dog does look pretty awesome.  I would go out with either of them.

 




 This is so sexy. 




 Why was she born in the fall?  I always associate baby animals with being born in the spring.  Or perhaps you're in Australia? 




 Forearms + glasses + beardface + farmer + excellent user name.  Yes please! 




 Not sure on the footing, but usually it's a mixture of tanbark and sand and dirt.  The green color is traditional for this show and is made from dying woodchips.  

So since this class is all about speed (while maintaining a correct frame) it's a combination of pushing your horse forward while bringing him back a bit to get him to collect.  For most of these ponies, they want to GO GO GO!  When I have shown them, you don't cluck much to move them on, you just stop telling them to slow down!  And you have to slow down in those tight corners as well, and lean into them so you don't flip the cart.  So yes, you can hear the driver's voice telling the pony to slow down, and then as they call for faster and faster speeds, she says less and just lets him fly! 

Conformation and manners also plays into the judging, as well as head carriage and correct motion of the gait.  I'd love to show one again -- so fun! 




 The first couple minutes is them walking to the ring -- which gets a bit long, but being with them as they charge down the ramp into the ring is incredible!  I've shown these ponies before, and they are an absolute delight. 









 Voted for Mr. Oliver! 




 I sponsored you!  All the best! 




 I made my eyes burn also.  Glad I'm not the only one. 




 So is that stuff basically made of cancer? 




 I had that cup! 




 This is why I only have pictures of my horse's nose! 




 My friends and I are still trying to figure out what the hell nipple blades are.  It's a fantastic card to play though.
 




 How in the world did he get up there? 




 This sounds like a fantastic idea.  I just graduated, so I'm not a rec member right now because I'm not currently paying student services fees, but I could get a membership.  As for the other side of the deal, I can teach you cooking no problem, and could also help with men's fashion!  If only I had access to a horse, I could teach you to ride too!  PM me and let's talk. 




 BAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  I feel like if I ever jumped my horse, this is how he would do it.   




 I even read that last bit in a sped up commercial announcer voice.  Uncanny sir. 




 Wow, quick response, and a good answer!  I had no idea so much went into it, though I'm not surprised it's so complex.  I am not a natural redhead, but I have heard about things related to redheads and anesthesia.  At the time I had both surgeries, I wasn't on any medications at all.  Though it is interesting that you mention Klonopin, because I've been taking that for the past couple years now.  If I need to go under again and am still on the Klonopin, maybe I'll be easier to handle. :) 




 How do you determine how much anesthesia to give a patient?  I've been put under twice, and they've commented both times about how hard I was to "knock out".  As in, I think they had to give me more anesthesia than they thought.  Does it have to do with a person's age?  Size?  I'm 27, female, and 120 lbs at 5'3".

Just wondering why I've been compared to "trying to take down a rhino."  Lol. 




 Love the Borlaug one!  I like to see him included in this grand company. 




 How awesome at biking do we need to be?  I just got a new bike that I've been riding every chance I get, but I'm still woefully out of shape, especially up hills.  Oh god, the hills. 




 What a total doll.  I wish my horse would chill out and do this, but he gets too excited and wiggles all over!   




 I too would like to know more about this meetup!
 




 So jealous of this barn/cabin! 




 I wanted to go for a hack too when I was in London and went here: http://www.wvstables.com/  It was FANTASTIC!  Absolutely top notch.  We rode out on the green and went cantering through a forest.  You also get to ride through town and they had horse crosswalks!  All the horses were well trained and in good shape, the trainers/owners were nice and knowledgeable.  Cannot recommend this place enough! 




 Watch the lip sync battle between John Krasinski and Jimmy Fallon.  First of all, hilarious.  Second of all, sexy.  It's about 8 minutes, but it's so worth it to watch the whole thing!

 He is a complete doll!  I love his markings. 




 That sounds fantastic!  I've really been overwhelmed by the number of people who have reached out to me.  I feel so welcomed already!  I'm eager to get to know the city.  I really love places that are little holes in the wall, so maybe you can show me some lesser known, but still awesome places to eat, drink, and hang out.

I'll let you know when I hit town!

- Nicole 




 Thanks for dropping me a PM!  I'll let you know when I hit town.  I've honestly been overwhelmed by the number of responses I've gotten.  It would be great to meet up and swap Minneapolis stories!

- Nicole 




 Thanks for the quick reply!  It's nice to know that meeting people will be quite easy.  I am INCREDIBLY social, so I hope I'll find some quality people to hang out with soon after I move, assuming I even have time to do that!

If I have any questions I'll let you know.  I've already gotten a couple responses from my post and it hasn't even been an hour!  I think moving to Madison will be just fine, and it's nice to have Redditors on my side. :)

 




 Holy crap Dan, that was a fast reply!  I may indeed be up for dinner with your and your ladyfriend.  I'll be living in what I think is Near East (right by Olbrich).  I'm a very social person and like having a large group of friends that enjoy doing things on a fairly regular basis.  Generally, I'm up for most things.  Going out, staying in, having potlucks/grilling out, going to museums/concerts/.  

I bit about me, I suppose.  I'm a 27 year old female currently living in Minneapolis and finishing my Master's thesis in Landscape Architecture.  The job at Olbrich is just a stop-gap internship while I find work in a design firm.  That job may be in Madison (if I fall in love with the place and there is work), or I may be moving in the fall to one of the coasts in hopes of getting a job out there.  I will also be continuing my job for the University of Minnesota as the copyeditor of the Landscape Journal, which will keep me a bit busy, at least for the summer.

I really appreciate you writing back so quickly!  The next few weeks are going to be tough as I uproot myself from the safety of graduate school and the friends I have made over the last 9 years of living in Minneapolis.  However, as we all know, change is necessary, and I sincerely hope the best is yet to come in my life!

I'll be in touch,
    Nicole   




 Greetings Madison!

I'll be moving to your fine city in about a month.  This marks my terrifying transition from graduate school up here in Minneapolis to the "real world", where people are married, have babies, and don't have time for new friends.  I know a few folks in Madison, but they are all married, or insanely busy, or both.  No babies though...yet.

WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?  Where should I go to meet up with some lovely, intelligent folks?  I see you have some bar meetups, and I plan on hanging out at coffeeshops, concerts, and the like, but how do you really meet people?  I'll be working at an internship at Olbrich Gardens, but as I'm the oldest intern by quite a few years, I don't think I'll be making many friends there with whom I would like to spend time outside of work.  

Anyways, let me know if you have some ideas.  PM me if you'd like to introduce yourself!  I'd love to get to know a few folks before I move, as this transition is proving to be particularly anxiety producing.  However, let it be known, I'm just coming out of a relationship and won't be looking for a "romantic connection" right off the bat.

See you all in a month! 




 Methinks this belongs on r/ladyboners. 




 That dress is gorgeous.  




 I currently live almost directly behind Matt's and have only been there twice in 9 years.  I think you're fine. :) 




 You should NOT be getting downvoted!  A helmet is a must for any beginning rider, and in my opinion, every rider.  15+ years of riding and I still wear one religiously.   




 Seeing him in concert in April!  I will have to resist pouncing him...
 




 This is AMAZING!  In the picture where you have the purple streak in your hair and are wearing the grey coat, you are ADORABLE.  I want to squeeze you!!!  Great work -- I cannot imagine how much courage it would take to become who you know you really are.  You look fantastic. 









 I would like to see what is behind the camera!  And of course, the forearms are tasty. 




 You are not alone.  My crush for 10+ years.  Oh Jason...
