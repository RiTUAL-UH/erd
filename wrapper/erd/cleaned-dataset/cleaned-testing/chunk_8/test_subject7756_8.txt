 well alrighty then 

















































 oh, you mean the F-35A that the F-16 ran rings around? That F-35A? 






















































 i cant even imagine what it was like to come out in that day and age. or the 70's for that matter, or the 80's. 90's MAYBE. but the 60's?? dang.

 lmao, the f-35 is the most expensive boondoggle in history. at this point, it's the poster child for a solution in search of a problem, because it doesnt fit any role for any aircraft in the current theater of operations. 

it may very well be a jack of all trades, but it is currently a master of none, so all the specialized aircraft currently deployed will run rings around it for their purpose. 

gimme a warthog any day of the week. 




 except that the only test it has passed so far with flying colors is that it managed to take off and land vertically, so it's got that going for it. the rest of it? great on paper, in actual test flights...... not so much
