 You are very new if you can not tell that this is not Balota... 




 That is a really great idea. Another cool feature of that, would be not only a logbook of your player, but of your character. So that every time you die, that log book would be reset. It would also be really awesome if you could read other character's log book after killing them. 




 **A Way for Fitting Weapons into Your Backpack**

 nbsp;

Storing Weapons in your backpack can be a real big hassle due to the only way of storing it in there, is sideways. Although, if most of us were to store a weapon in a backpack in real life, we would do it facing up, right? So why not do that in DayZ. Make weapons take up the same amount of space, but let them face upwards. I thought of this because most weapons can not be stored in backpacks as the backpack's space in the inventory does not have a big enough width.

Thank you to anyone who reads this, and have a great day! 




 There is also quite an extreme amount of posts regarding 'Hackers', I believe there should just be a PSA that is stickied so that users know about the situation. 




 Do you have anything in the 'filter' 




 That is the same as me. I play quite a lot of DayZ on medium pop servers (Australian). The one I saw (Actually I did not see them, because they were in the Camo building wall glitch) my friends ran in to try and secure it, because we had a farming hoe. Then suddenly one of them loses their gear, then they get carpet bombed. Luckily I was on the hill outside. This happened at Veresnik. 




 Agreed. Although the problem with night time in DayZ and the way people use it, saddens me. It is night time it is supposed to be dark, why maximise your gamma for extra visibility? They add the gas-lantern, torch and chemlight for a reason. 




 I also want the Developers to focus on the multi-player and optimizing, but we probably will not see much optimizing until the final version. 




 Admins doing this would be way cooler. 




 It would be great if the admins also challenged the players, such as the admins being the heroes/bandits protecting the objective. 




 That would add a terrifying atmosphere to the game. Just imagine, your character looks at his watch (Please add devs) he sees the clock strike some time like (2:13 AM or 1:43AM) some time when it's dark. A gunshot is heard from out of nowhere, then a group of Bandits are running at you. 




 There would not be a linear story. You could side with Bandits and Heroes, maybe they would both have the same objective, but they would get there different ways. If eventually the devs let us learn their new scripting language and let us build custom mods for SA, I will learn and make this. You wouldn't even need to do the quests, you could just kill everyone and rule the land. 




 No, the bandits and heroes would be AI.  




 Of course. The objectives would be difficult and time consuming because you would get an approximate location of the items you are looking for, and those areas would be flooded with zombies or bandits/heroes. 




 "Singe player would be boring" That is an opinion. You wouldn't be forced to play Single player, it would only be a feature available within the game. 




 I didn't say that they would completely remove Multi-player. It would be an additional mode, where you get a single player character. This character wouldn't be available for use in Multi-player servers. 









 So after 140 hours of playing the Standalone, I still do not know how to solve this very simple problem. Whenever I am in the North West. (A lot of the time) I have this problem where my character is hungry and/or thirsty, yet my character is stuffed, this makes it difficult to keep energized and Hydrated. Any help is appreciated.
