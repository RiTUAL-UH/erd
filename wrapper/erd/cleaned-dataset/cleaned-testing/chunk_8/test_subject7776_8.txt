 Livin' that dry desert life here! 




 Throw same $$$ my way, and I'll wash it! :P 




 It truly is an amazing color, especially when clean! 




 Mustang English lessons, hell yeah. 




 It does pretty good, if there's a scratch, I don't see it. But there is a deep one on my rear fender from the previous owner, but no one really sees that one too. 




 Me and the 15 probably will always be together. 




 If you got 40k, your dick can grow! 




 The stripe really helps. 




 Anytime dude, never actually seen you, just your photography, keep it up! 




 Hey! You liked my post my man! Good shots dude! 




 That sounds better, thanks! 




 Hell yeah. 




 Same my man. 




 It's purdy, aint it? 




 But he didn't wash it, I did. I'm watching it while he's gone. 




 I always thought it always went "My friend and I" so I just put an 's and cars. :p 




 Yeah, never shows dust until you actually touch the car. Plus it shines magnificently. 




 Yeah... I don't know how else to put it. 









 Sick man, enjoy it when you can!! 




 Yeah, the dealership added the stripes, they also did the tinting of all the cars. I was saying that the Rocker stripes are really just dumb IMO, because while yes, it is 50 years from when Mustangs were made, its just the Base GT with the dealer stripes added. 




 I'm sure he figured, Young guy, Brand new fast car, and doesn't want to get chewed out in the Corps for speeding. Since, in the first place he shouldn't have been driving, he got talked to about that before he came back.
Yup, it was literally one exit before PAVS.
I'm not saying he doesn't deserve one, obviously 40+MPH over could seriously hurt someone, and with what we were doing, I'm slightly surprised we didn't actually hit anything. They gave his GF a ticket, which she's obviously upset about, but she was basically doing what we did, on a lesser extent.
If a cop saw us going up to flagstaff on Friday night, woooo, that'd be a funny thing. 




 We went to San Tan, but a lot were Auto, which isn't what he wanted.
And the stripes are sick, until you realize that its not a 50th, and the side stripes are just annoying when you notice that. [This is the one my friend had bought](http://www.bergeford.com/new/Ford/2015-Ford-Mustang-mesa-az-eb8b4eff0a0a0064487c13719b4589bf.htm) 




 Yessir. 




 Agreed. Performance is lovely. 




 Yeah my friend bought his at Berge, he got 2k off a GT, and that was the most wiggle room they could give him, so they said. So he paid 35k instead of 37, but after taxes and stuff it was low 40 according to his girlfriend. They were really nice and kind about everything. They let us have a test drive (which they're strict about, since who wants a "new" car with 100 miles on it already?). They cracked jokes with us and let him take all the time he wanted with buying. 




 Yeah, they now are kicking everyone out after the classic show is over. Which is silly because they're all old and go to bed at 9.. 




 I think I see more DSAZ members here than on the forums, lmao. 




 I love the 15's, Headroom up front is awesome, being 6'0, sitting in the back is kind of a bitch to put it lightly. The new Mustangs definitely turn more heads than any other car in its class. Personally, I haven't driven it yet so I don't know how it handles, but my friend said it handles amazingly.
And seeing him do a slide in a cul-de-sac, I believe him.
Berge Ford in Mesa had a few GT's, if you actually wanted to drive one. They also have a 50 Years Limited Edition, but its a 50k car. 




 Oh yeah. 




 You're bustin' my balls man. It's lightly used! only 150 miles! 




 Yeah it was! Ton of Mustangs, but in total around 500+ people showed up. Way more than PAVS. 




 250 




 Tempting... Tempting... 




 He got it on the 29th, had it for 6 hours, we went to go to an Instagram meet-up held in Scottsdale. The cop said he saw us going fast but wasn't going to do anything, and then he started going faster, and faster, we hit 95, and then the cop got next to him, no lights on and waited until there was room to pull him over, then he talked him.
From what I was told by my friend and his passenger, is that he told him he was following us for quite some time, and then asked my friend what he does for a living, to which my friend told him hes in the Marine Corps, and the cop said "You don't want to die do you?" and "Do you like your car?", he told him to slow down and to tell me to slow down.
Probably passed at least 5 cars pulled over on the way back.
And his girlfriend got pulled over by the same cop a little bit down the road for 84 in a 55, but wrote her for 74 in a 55.

He was a pretty cool cop, I'm glad he didn't pull me over, or I'd be out a car.

And thus concludes story time. 




 Yeah, plus with the stripe it has, it stands out. 




 No idea. Was from Berge Ford in Arizona. 




 My friend had planned to surprise everyone with him coming home Thanksgiving morning from his Marine MOS school. I went to pick him up at 3am and we surprised everyone. We had planned a trip to Flagstaff for that Friday and before we went up, he wanted to see a few Mustangs, as he told me he wanted to buy a new car. There was this one, or an 04 Cobra with 78k Miles. He drove the GT and we left saying "We will be back tomorrow." After we left, its all we could talk about that night and into the next morning. We came back from Flagstaff and even before he went to our homes, we went to the dealership. His mind was made, and he bought it that day. He already had gotten pulled over once in it for 95 in a 55 (construction zone). (Thankfully they went after him and not me!) I'm the only one he will let look after it and make sure its clean, so I get to buff and wax it tomorrow, since there already is a scratch.
All in all, it's an incredible car, and I've changed my mind about it. I'd want one. 









 The mod is better, IMO. More to do, a lot more. 




 I don't understand why this is a thing. I'm not abusing the kicking power. I'm helping get rid of a troll of the team and we all vote to kick him, Happened 3 times.

I get killing team mates, but giving me a cooldown because I agreed to kick someone who obviously can't play the game is just dumb. 









 Hey, It's Inked! :D 




 You get a free car wash! 




 But... The Termi 4.6 :( 




 Fun fact: That color is called Legend Lime!

That wasn't fun, I'm sorry. 




 on point 




 Yes. 




 I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't have a key, lmao. If anyone has one, just PM me it, thank you! 




 If you need a cowl hood, by all means, get one! 




 I wish, they're seat covers, previous owner put them in to keep the leather in good condition. 




 Looks nice, whats done to it? 




 Meguiar's Ultimate Quik Wax! And Thank you! 









 I love that feelings so much. I always try to park so I can see it from my work. 




 Woo! The more New Edges, the better! Nice catch man. I myself just got a 04 Dark Shadow Gray GT, and man do I love it, mines bone stock as well. Time to build it up! Congrats man! 




 rained really hard in Arizona, not used to it, Went around a turn in my neighborhood and put it in second, went completely sideways and almost hit the curb. (This was in my old '95 v6) 




 Right? Got an old sn95 beater and never hit anything. 




 First mod for me, coyote. Lol. Nice car man, love watching the videos you post of it. 




 Woooo! Lets go 40th anni's! 




 I could never fucking getta Cybunny. 









 Yeah! I saw it, instantly sold my car and went for this. I couldn't pass it up. It's really everything I've wanted. Besides it not being a Termi. Lol 




 Thanks! I appreciate it. 




 It's only ever nice in fall/winter, cause then you can actually stand going outside and it's not 110. Lol 




 Arizona! 




 Got it for 10k 




 I was lucky to find it, someone backed out on buying it, so I went for it. Thank you! I'll treat it nicely. ;) 




 Time to get ALL the stickers. 




 It's a 2004 DSG Mustang GT, 40th anniversary, Premium, has 24.5k miles, no real problems besides just some cosmetic things, like oxidation in the third brake light and on the driver side headlight, has a scratch behind the tire and a small dent, and has a scuff on the passenger side front bumper that I plan of buffing out this weekend.

Overall I'm in love with it, its my favorite body style, has all the little doodads I wanted, (keyless entry and power windows are a god send).

I can't wait to start making changes to it.

 Oh it is cheap, my dash shakes, and the door panel is coming off, whenever I drive, you can hear the plastic in the car shaking. It's really quite sad. 




 I feel you there, I got used to it since its the same as my 95's interior, its just a change in the body style. 




 Dude where? 




 I got approved for a 04 DSG GT, we should start a club or something. 




 I think the New edges had the best designs, for really anything.
Roush, Saleen, SVT, Mach, and just the Basic V6/GT. 




 Dude, soon, Hopefully I'll get approved for a DSG 04 GT. 




 Mine just has all of our bread in it.. 




 This and a TR 10th Cobra are my dream cars, someday. 




 No :(! I didn't know there was one! Pretty sure I saw it leave though, it was black right? 'Cause that thing sounded so good! 




 I looked and I just see imitations. :( 




 Damn, nice turn out :O 




 Basically take the folks with fancy cars, or unique cars, and have a giant meet! 




 True, I did see the wheels man. 




 Ah, so the black 5.0 is his. 




 Didn't bring, need gas for the cruise tonight. But I have the POS red 1995 v6. With the loud power steering. Lmao. 




 Yeah man, DSAZ! 









 I own a 95 v6, and damn do I fill up often.. But I like my car, but I do want to get rid of it and get something better. 




 Soon.... 




 I know with my little 95 v6, when I rev, it's mostly engine noise, no exhaust. Maybe he's talking about that? 




 Thats what I'm thinking, but my friend is currently doing Marine training, so hes not here, we're just trying to fix it up for him when he gets back, but I do know its got BBK CAI, Cobra Intake Manifold, Short Throw Shifter, Pretty sure no Muffler that I could see.

Believe me, I'm trying to find the Modlist that he has, Earliest I can know is Tuesday when he leaves MCT to go for MOS school, I can keep you posted! 




 Oh we will, but this is the first time it's started in a while and it was 9pm, we went around the neighborhood and the neighbors came out and told us to stop since it was 9:30. The car hasn't had tags for 2 years so we're working on getting that all sorted out, but once thats done.. Gonna fucking rev the shit out of it. 









 Oh yeah. 




 Found a DSG 04 GT in my area, but I'm short 10 grand. Lmao. But you're welcome man, kinda wanna black one out now. 




 That is a really good looking GT.

One day... 




 Awesome to see other members! 




 DSAZ? 




 NRG, cause, energy 




 Pretty sure its his, check history. 




 Duuuude that'd be cool. 




 Gotcha. 




 We have different tastes, I LOVE the new edge style. But I can see where you're coming from, outside of the mustang group a Termi is just a mustang and not a special car, but a Shelby is a big deal because, well Shelby. 




 A low mile Mystic goes for 30-35k On SVTP. There's one on there with 1k miles and it's about 33ish I wanna say. And you can find a decent 10th anni for 20-25k. If they went for double that, it wouldn't be my achievable dream car. :P 




 I don't know man, SVT Cobras get a lot of attention and they're in the 22k range. 




 Mouth is feels better, I even scrubbed my tongue and used mouth wash. I feel like a new person!
