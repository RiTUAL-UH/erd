 Nope, but it was similar. Younger presenter, still in HS. In some of the videos she is a Freshman in college. I think they are pretty recent. 




 Nope, it was a lot more professionally done, with a theme song, much higher rez video, and a lot longer. 




 It's one of the funniest things I've ever seen on YouTube - I want to show it to some friends but I can't remember what her name was. It was part of a series, she does makeup advice, study skills, etc. too (those obviously aren't as funny.) 



















 Quite creative, you should turn this into a short story or novel!
 




 "I sleep and breathe and bleed just as you do." Creepy stuff... I loved this documentary - by the end I half-believed in the Mothman. I think there really might have been some sort of chemical leak that caused mass hallucinations in the area.

 And yet, some of us have multiple pieces of Bill the Cat merchandise. I don't know if that counts as a success or a failure... 




 Whichever one was assigned to the file to begin with. Let's assume I open iTunes and load song "foo" with ID number 12345. A line appears in iTunes called "foo," and behind the scenes, iTunes knows that when I click on that line, it opens file 12345. 

I could then re-name the file "foo2" and move it to a different folder. It doesn't matter, all that does is change where *I* see the file. To iTunes it's still 12345 and it's still stored in the same place on the disk. 




 At that stage of development humans are totally obsolete. I'm talking about the intermediate stage where people who can't attain a very high level of skill are shut out of full-time labor markets. 




 They will probably try to find some niche that has not yet been automated, probably in personal services or some other kind of face-to-face interaction, or in making creative content for the internet. "odd jobs" like this might not provide a full-time income, but I can see people pursuing stuff like this in the future in order to get the extra stuff they might want. There will still be economic incentives, but no longer will there be economic devastation for those shut out of regular labor markets. 




 So are you saying that things could have been designed this way, but now it's too late because of the assumptions that programmers make about how files are stored?  




 What I was thinking was a system that gave each file a unique ID number, and *that's* what iTunes would look up. Putting it in a different folder would only change how it appears in the user interface, not where it actually is on the disk for iTunes to load. Same with changing the name of a file. It seems like it would be so simple. 









 I think most people will always want something "extra" - nicer apartment, newest video game system, etc. that will encourage work. 




 Give the poor just enough so they don't starve/riot is not socialism. It's just warehousing and we do a lot of that already. 




 Broke is better than dead buddy. Blue lips is a bad sign. Go to a free clinic in your area or an emergency room. 




 I didn't know he would keep his porn and random wedding pictures of this girl in the default "Music" folder on his computer

Sounds like he wanted to get caught. 









 Is there such a concept as malemployment in economics as there is with malinvestment? That is, reducing UI might lead to a lower unemployment rate but a higher malemployment rate - people working in jobs that are not close to the economic optimum because they feel forced to take the first thing that comes along. 

Underemployment doesn't quite get at what I'm thinking about here because someone could be underemployed just because there are no jobs equal to his or her level of training, whereas malemployment would be more of a search problem for those jobs that do exist. The difference between the two would sort of be like the difference between a liquidity and a solvency problem at a bank. 




 And the UK hopes no one finds out the reason Iran turned into such a freak was because he and the US teamed up and stole all his stuff in Middle School. 




 If OBE's represent physically real phenomena, they should be relatively easy to test. Just put some random objects in a locked room and have someone who is out-of-body float over and take a look at them. Very simple and very scientific. Monroe claimed to have a technology that could reliably produce OBE's.

However, he seemed far more interested in cataloging scads of "other realms" and altered states which he numbered like Focus 1-100 and encounters with alien beings that were completely unverifiable. It is interesting stuff and might very well represent real *inner* experiences (that is, I don't think Monroe was just making stuff up - he was a wealthy man before starting his paranormal research), but he was not a proper scientist.  




 Yikes, I would not call Monroe scientific. He's good reading though - a modern Swedenborg.  




 It took me two whole years to make good friends at college, but once I did I made two lifelong friends that I would not give up for anything. Keep your head up and don't give up - your college friends are out there, you will find them if you stay true to yourself. 




 I beg to differ. I liked the future tech tree and the space/sea expansion - added a whole new dimension to the civ experience. I wasted much time in college with CTP. 




 Don't do what, kill yourself or get married?? 




 If you really are contemplating suicide, please seek help. Killing yourself at 25 because of relationship issues is not the right solution - trust me, I've been there and at the same age too. Several years later I am now married (though no kids yet!) - so keep your head up, it does get better!! 




 Or the bathroom was where the bomb was hidden. Alert /r/conspiracy  




 Lovely sentiments, until you realize that Rutherford is a pro-privatization outfit that helped to fund "Waiting for Superman." 




 Good points. I would say that this willingness to "go under" is what stays out of the cycling and is the part that is done with the cycles. 




 Nietzsche would probably be horrified at the "dialectical" interpretation that you just gave his work, but that's not a bad place to start. However the bermensch is in some sense "done with" that cycling you describe (although it continues in a transformed way under his gaze.)

 




 Happy birthday thanks for getting me hooked on Italian rap music. 









 The two are not mutually exclusive. There were many occult-oriented Christians in the Nazi Party, and yes there were some outright pagans too. Himmler and Hesse to name the two most prominent. Himmler advised his SS officers to have sex in graveyards so their wives would give birth to the reincarnated souls of German warriors. I don't remember reading that in the Bible. 




 You might want to edit out the cat in the SS uniform before putting this on your slideshow... 




 What's that green area? The Aldi Neutral Zone? 




 Ok, I will attempt a real answer: That looks like reflex tearing, which can be a sign of dehydration. However, I have no idea why he'd be that dehydrated *before* the game even started. That would be really dangerous for an athlete.  




 Consider the fact that you might be feeling the same way had you made the opposite choices. The other woman might annoy you also. The safe job might make you feel bored and wish that you'd followed your passion instead. None of this is the end of the world or the end of your life - believe me, I've made some *terrible* choices in my life too - you can recover. 

But... you can't be wishy-washy. Either commit to the woman you're with now or get out of the relationship. Either commit to grad school and being poor for a while or get into the family business now before you have family responsibilities of your own. 




 Haha, yeah, that's the step where I'm stuck too. 









 how'd this guy even get elected?

Six-way race - anything can happen! 22-way California governor recall election resulted in Governor Schwarzenegger. Jesse Ventura and Al Franken getting elected to high office, just blame that on Minnesota being weird (though Franken has turned out to be an excellent Senator.)
 




 I agree - I am going to change how I present this in class this year and ditch the "two daughters" stuff. 









 Most great killers are also great romantics. Stalin wrote love poetry, as did Mao. 



















 It does more than "stink," it will strangle the economy in the long run. Health care doesn't work as a market because prices are opaque, there is no time for price discovery anyway in an emergency, demand is almost completely inelastic, and there are no substitute goods (can't buy anything else if you're dead or incapacitated.) 

If Obamacare fails companies are going to push more healthcare costs on to their workers or drop plans altogether, and then you really will see perceived disposable income start to fall, since most will consider health insurance a necessity. Consumer demand will take a big hit and the economy will suffer further. 




 True but to someone who doesn't know the technical economic definition of "capital," it does sound Orwellian. 




 I suppose the question then is are these health-care plans worth the money the insurance companies are charging employers? Wages are fungible, health care plans are not. 

Even if a worker is being "compensated" more that he realizes with a health-care plan, how much of the value of that plan ever flows to the worker, and how much is captured in excess profits by the medical industry which benefits from endemic market failure in the health care sector? 




 In the introduction to de Voto's "The Course of Empire," there is a very strange and poetic paragraph about the Age of Exploration attributed to an "Emery Heywood." I figured he was a writer or a historian and his writing style was so unique I decided to look him up to see what else he wrote. I can find no trace of any writer or historian by that name on the Internet. 

Does anyone here know who this person was and what his (or her?) connection to de Voto was? I am quite curious now... 









 Read "Before the Storm" excellent book about Goldwater - he enticed Southern evangelicals into voting Republican by opposing Civil Rights in the 60's. Later, he regretted what he had done and even began to call himself a liberal - but it was too late. 





























 True, but not all creative train wrecks are so bizarre. I could see a "postmodern" Cop Rock where half the show was behind-the-scenes "reality" footage being strangely entertaining.

Plus, Broadway spinoff... 









 Cop Rock lasted eleven episodes before it was yanked for good in December 1990and it went out in its own inimitably weird metatextual style, with everyone breaking characterI cant believe they cancelled us, one cop says. Yeah, I know, I only got to sing one song, another respondsand crewmembers coming out from behind the scenes to join the cast in one final number.

Please, please, bring this show back. They're re-making Ironside so why not?? 
























 You can respond, you just can't vote on them I think. 




 Going through all the old threads I saved and never had time to read 




 He would also know how to spell Colombia 









 That's like just your opinion maaaaaaaan 




 Since OP has disappeared, I assume one is the UK. There are now govt-subsidized mortgages around 1% there now. They're basically paying you to buy a house. 














  we know a person will become unable to function after ~48 hrs of wakefulness

How is this changed by drugs like Provigil, which (supposedly) allow you to stay awake for five days with normal functioning? 









 Haha, this is uplifting news, no wishing death on the elderly. 




 If you look at the age breakdown you'll see why. It's 96% among people under 30. 














 Interesting your experience was so different from mine. Probably because I was not really looking at the face at all - I usually looked down so as to better concentrate on what was being said - to me looking at the face was distracting! 




 Believe me, people notice, they just don't say anything. I was in college before I knew that I didn't do this. My roommate was the kind of blunt person who would point out stuff like that, but afterwards when I asked other people they confirmed that I didn't make eye contact, they just never mentioned it, assuming I was shy or whatever, but honestly I'm not that shy it's just not something I ever thought to do. 




 There were a few groups that split off from Catholicism sooner than the Lutherans, but most were crushed militarily. A few are still around. The Lutherans were the first major group to split off from the Catholic church and not get largely killed off. 




 And what about monkey butlers? Inquiring minds want to know... 









 Low-status groups tend to be more aware of honor/respect issues than high-status ones, at least in my (modern) experience, just as someone with food insecurity is going to worry a lot more about the state of their fridge than someone who can just go to a restaurant if it breaks down. 

Obviously in feudal times things were different and no I am not suggesting that all blacks are low-status, but there is a correlation. 





























 Yep, that's the big mystery. I would guess that mysterious exiles from neighboring societies would sometimes wander in. Sometimes they might have been seen as divine emissaries.  




 What is the difference between love and attachment in your opinion? 




 Very good point, thank you. 




 What do you think it means? 




 Very insightful, thank you! 




 I mostly agree. I do think there is an element of enclosure to the self, but it's not absolute - and that trying to make it absolute does cause a lot of (unnecessary) suffering. 




 Wow, awesome quote. I've never heard that one before thanks 




 Not so sure it's arbitrary. At least with the specific example you refer to (xenia), the Greek religion believed gods would travel disguised as humans, rewarding good hosts and punishing bad ones. 

Of course this reflected/reinforced an underlying cultural attitude, but I don't think that just comes out of nowhere. Caring for a guest can be expensive, not to mention possibly dangerous. There must have been reasons why such customs arose despite these costs. 




  Not treating travelers well has been considered a very bad thing in a lot of older cultures because if you were unwelcoming to travelers, you may very well be sentencing them to death. 

And because those travelers might have an army somewhere behind them! Mistreatment of merchants and diplomats sometimes got you a visit from Genghis Khan. 




 They are not registered anywhere, so we are assuming money is an appropriate gift. Thanks for the tips. 




 I don't believe in a "solid" self (atta), however I am not willing to give up the notion of a changeable, open-to-the-world self, even if suffering results. I agree totally with your last paragraph, very well put. 




 Al-Jazeera is not owned by oil companies, though it is supported by an oil-producing state. You could say the same thing then about Fox News Saudi ownership.

 I've always liked what Al Gore said more than how he said it - he's always had a tin ear towards looking hypocritical or like a preachy high school principal. 




 No kidding. This is the first time I can ever remember it, in fact. Usually they just quietly fold when a better money-making scheme comes around, like Moral Majority and the Christian Coalition did. 




 I thought it was a dramatized portrayal, not a documentary. I have not seen it but I might go this weekend. 




 He said he'd go back to Sweden (not Switzerland), if they agreed not to extradite him to the US. They refused. One of the women making the accusations against him has known CIA connections. He is not even being charged with rape but with some other weird sort of sexual offense that doesn't even exist in most countries. Both women admit that they slept with him voluntarily. 




 I think that's a good approach but I'm not sure it's one a lot of Buddhists share - there is this idea that Nirvana is the end of *all* emotion, indeed all sensate experience period, and the release into some totally unfathomable realm. 




 Yeah, I've thought of that - NOT that I am claiming to be a bodhisattva!

I always thought the compassion and non-attachment sides of Buddhism were in conflict with each other. Compassion seems to all be about caring for others, and non-attachment seems to be about withdrawing from the world, including others.

Maybe it's a creative tension though. I can see how compassion can get people past their self-attachment, but that makes compassion instrumental (i.e. "I am only trying to feel for you in order to ease my own suffering"), and I'm not really comfortable with that.

But I am only a Level 1 Laser Lotus so I'm sure your insight is far more advanced! 




 I don't necessarily believe in some of the "mystical" aspects of Buddhism (cosmic Buddhas, reincarnation, siddhis, etc.), but I've been influenced by Buddhist philosophy since I was a young teenager. I meditate and admire Buddhist leaders and speakers. 

However I've never called myself a Buddhist or even a "secular Buddhist" and recently I've realized my main "block" to the tradition is that I'm ok with suffering. If that's the price for loving the world and trying to build a self, I can accept that. To eliminate suffering by giving up that attachment to life seems like a bad deal to me.

Anyone else feel the same way? 




 I don't think that actually goes on a lot in the US. It is so easy to destroy someone's character image or reputation, you don't need to be blatant about it and actually kill them (see: Assange, others.) JFK himself is a different story since he had real power to change things, but I doubt any witnesses to the assassination were themselves assassinated. In any large group of people there will be strange deaths.

Extreme Republicans got themselves worked up thinking Hillary Clinton was offing dozens of people to cover up her shady real estate deals by basically going through the list of everyone she knew. Guess what? Some of them had died in weird ways... that doesn't mean she killed them, it means she was a politician who knew a ton of people. 




 No good. I'm sure that symbolizes loneliness. 




 I'm not so sure about that. That statement was made before she got a 4-6 year prison sentence. Her family believes it was suicide and she told a friend she would rather die than go back to jail. I would not be surprised if some compromised politician did her in, but the evidence does point to suicide. 




 It is one Japanese and an American ex-resident of Japan. Since the wedding doesn't appear to be involving any of the American's religious traditions, my sense is the Japanese side is going to predominate. A lot of people have said the even number of bills thing, which makes more sense - I think that's where the divisible by four nonsense got started. 

Thanks for the advice! 




 Good point... $150 it is then. 




 Action-movie music in the background was laughable - still interested in seeing it though I will wait for the reviews. 




 Don't panic. This happened to me when the landlord lost the check then I went on vacation so I didn't get the late payment notice (they never bothered to call.) Since the rent has now been paid, there's no basis for the summons and it should be cancelled. The landlord has to call the court - and they will - if the landlord lets a case come before a judge when the issue has been resolved that is going to be one upset judge - he or she might even fine the landlord. 




 Beautiful, I feel the exact same way a lot of the time. I'm beginning to realize that I've had a lot of pain in my life, but I wouldn't trade the rawness you get from that pain for anything, it's made me who I am today. 









 Maybe someday. Since most members of Westboro are actually just the lead guy's family, it would probably take an epic family feud. If you leave his church you are cut off from all your family members as well. 




 There is not a charge for the reception. I guess I should have mentioned the wedding is going to be in the US, so some US and some Japanese traditions mixed, probably. $300 is a lot considering we are already spending about that much on travel. Thanks for the advice though. 




 Very good points, but there are examples of knights, or armies led by knights, suppressing peasant revolts in the Middle Ages. I can think of several in England and Germany. I guess you might defend that as a time when feudalism was breaking down - they all did occur in the Late Middle Ages, 1300- 1550 from what I can remember. 




  Sounds like "horsepucky" as my mom would say.. I don't think giving them $100 or $150 would be horribly offensive to their culture - but I thought I'd ask here just to make sure. 














 Online phone directories today are really powerful. They'll often not only give you multiple phone numbers for that person, but their address and (this shocked me when I used one the other day), people who they are associated with (don't know how the phone company gets that information, but whatever). Give it a shot. 




 Same here, just posted about the same thing. Keep your head up, I know how it feels. 




 Are you sure it wasn't a coyote? They make all kinds of weird sounds. 
























 This should be for real life not just reddit 




 How long ago was this? In the past few years devices have been invented that are basically lasers for sound - they can direct sound at a particular target without anyone else around hearing it. Someone could have been pulling a prank on you. 




 What about Penguin? Wasn't he a demented aristocrat? 




 He's arrested a lot of the top generals and literally all of the admirals. Unless there are colonels willing to act independently, he probably doesn't have much to fear from the military.

On the other hand, colonel-led coups are not unknown in history... 




 It's like he actually wants to spur a revolution.

That might be exactly what he's doing. If he really does want to consolidate power, the chaos of a revolutionary situation might be his best bet. Of course, if you lose that bet you lose the country, but he might be willing to roll the dice. 




 I did not realize the Chinese had troops garrisoned in North Vietnam. How did the alliance go sour so fast that by 1979 they were at war? 




 I will check it out thanks for the links 




 I don't think NATO ever stopped fearing a Soviet invasion, right up until the fall of the Soviet Union. Also, I don't think it was ever proven that the more extreme actions of some Gladio groups were directed by NATO, or part of a coherent NATO strategy to undermine native communism in Western Europe. Most historians believe that a few of these groups decided to take matters into their own hands, or that Gladio recruited extreme rightists thinking they would follow orders, and they didn't. 




 I would distinguish between a honeypot and something like Gladio. A honeypot is a government agent or false group that poses as an extremist leader or oganization to attract followers, then the whole group is rounded up, since of course the leader knows who everyone is, etc. 

Gladio was a covert stay-behind guerrilla force set up by NATO in preparation for a possible Soviet invasion. Unfortunately the kind of folks who are eager to join covert stay-behind guerrilla forces are not always the best-disciplined people on the planet, and several Gladio units started freelancing in organized crime and extreme right-wing activities, most notably in Italy and Turkey. 









 Personally I believe the EDL and Anjem Choudhry are both state honeypots to attract extremists.

I'd say that's crazy, but then I remember Hal Turner here in the US (Nazi radio host who was really working for the FBI), so who knows... 




 Or maybe Yaxley-Lennon just doesn't seem fascist enough... 




 I think that just means he is a gold member, not that he got gold for that particular post. 





























 Guilt about spending too much time on the Internet (created worlds) instead of with your girlfriend? Or maybe you are afraid of her mom? Just a guess. Sometimes dreams are just random and don't really mean anything, even intense ones. 




 I think you mean *only* one is confirmed? Anyway, I'm down the wiki rabbit hole again... goodbye Saturday 









 What are some that are still a mystery? I thought these had pretty much all been debunked or shown to be hoaxes.  









 I think he wasn't as drunk this time 




 Interesting. What did the professor think was going on with the phenomenon? 









 I realize this is a very broad question, but I've seen some pretty out-there claims being accepted uncritically by the media recently. Of course, tech breakthroughs do happen from time to time, so I'm not convinced these devices are scams either. I would like to know what a group of people inclined to be skeptical about extraordinary claims thinks about this issue. 




 Metaphysics simply means the search for a reason behind the laws of physics as they exist, it doesn't mean channelings and crystal healings. 

If you posit rules, you still haven't reached an absolute nothingness. You still have to explain why those rules and not others, or no rules at all. 




 No time, no space, but there is a rule set. That's not a metaphysical "nothing," which would not imply a rule set. 









 "Nothing" turns out to be "Quantum Foam" with the laws of Quantum Mechanics already built in. Not exactly "nothing" in the philosophical sense. Quite disappointing. I would recommend "Why Does the World Exist?" as an alternative although it gets sort of wooly too at the end.

 I draw the line at people who make demonstrably false claims about *this* reality (as opposed to possible other ones.) McKenna is on the acceptable side of the line for me, whereas guys like Drunvalo Melchizedek are on the other.  









 Unless you plan on living hundreds of trillions of years, apparently the answer is no. 









 I had a good experience, but I didn't come away feeling like I'd gone to the spirit world or anything. I will say that it's worth the money.

Interesting. You always hear about the breakthrough trips but I'd imagine there are a lot of people like you out there as well. What was your experience like and why do you think it was still worth the money even if it wasn't "as advertised"? (I'm thinking of going next summer...) 



















 sorry about that
