 it's a real sausage party in here 




 Thank you! My fridge could use some more Sounders swag though  




 It's delicious! I have to admit... The only sujuk I've had is the one I've made at home. 

The jist of it is it's a basic beef blend with red wine, garlic, paprika, etc but I think the flavor you're referring to is fenugreek! It's super yummy and is that X factor is sausages usually. 




 it's all good! sausage casings do usually come from intestines which is why they have that shape so you weren't wrong

also you gotta start somewhere but don't be scared! cooking can be a lot of fun :) 




 you know it! I actually only lived in Seattle for a year but it's still a near and dear place in my heart  




 Sausage making is 2 basic steps: meat grinding + casing!

To make this recipe, I ground a blend of short rib and round meat to get a 70/30 fat ratio.

Using some hog casings I bought online, I then stretched the casings over my kitckenaid sausage stuffer attachment and then stuffed the blended meat in there!
