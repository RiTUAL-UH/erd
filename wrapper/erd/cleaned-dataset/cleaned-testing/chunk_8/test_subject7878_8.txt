 That made me laugh out loud.  Hahaha! 









 No, [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/5Ukcneo.jpg) is you on Tatooine. 




 The casting was WAY OFF with Hayden Christensen.

I could totally see THIS Anakin killing kids in the Jedi Temple. 




 They aren't good. 




 Pretty good.  Couple of parts made me chuckle.  Good work! 









 I have no idea why he spelled ***ignorant*** like "inaccurate". 




 For the lazy: 1-800-FREE-SEX is what the number is. 




 This kind of shit belongs on 4chan. 




 You're welcome! 




 "Kefu" is a Turkish curse word...

(No, that's true... I have no idea.  Haha!) 




 It's not just the internet; it's the world. 




 Fallout 3 soundtrack. 




 ALWAYS start with the Thrawn trilogy (Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising and The Last Command).  If you do, you'll want to read them all.

Stay away from "The Crystal Star".  It was bizarre and pointless. 




 I loved the guy's reaction.  HAHA!  "What the--oh, shit... play it cool, man.  Play it cool..." 




 You mean she captured your true form... 




 HAM radio antenna, bruh. 




 Our 15yo daughter has had extremely sporadic and random periods.  The GYN prescribed her some birth control to take for 3-4 months to help regulate it.

Knowing the church's stance on birth control for it's contraceptive purpose, how does it feel if being used to treat a medical issue (e.g., regulate periods)?

Thanks in advance! 




 Ba-dum-TSS! 




 [Redacted] 




 Indeed. Misread the poorly-written OP. 




 Well, hope he has a good lawyer. 




 Thug life is a social class that is out-dated and pointless.

The Confederate Flag is history for the Southern states. It represents state's rights in opposition of the federal government ignoring such rights. 




 I think the White Walker army will decimate a vast majority of Westeros.  Dany and her dragons will fly in and destroy the army.  A greatful Westeros will make her their queen. The End. 




 [Redacted] 




 Gotcha.  I understand the "tmed" abbreviation, but I came up with the phrase "medic-aided tanks" (read "medicated") which sounds more fun to me.  HAHA! 




 That's Pepto Lake on the island of Bismol. 




 Haha--yes indeed. Every layout I've done on my own was horrible. LOL 




 Living in a country with the freedoms we have, there isn't a cure-all that would stop mass shootings. To think otherwise is naive.

There will always be crazy, racist, or evil people out there who want to hurt people. This has been the case throughout human history. 




 Here is my base's latest raid. Tanks went quickly right through me like a quart of egg-drop soup. LOL

https://youtu.be/eCaLt6Sr2Ec 




 Just not worry about my base getting raided so easily? 




 Took me a while to save up my res. 




 Yes, GBE and/or tanks does a number on me. 




 Level it up you mean? I have all the units.

What should I level up first? 




 Awesome! Any glaring issues? 









 I'm HQ-16, Lvl-39; I wouldn't get one yet. 




 I had an arterial aneurysm in my left arm (near my armpit) at the age of two. I had it worked on, but they all said I would have more and probably not live past 16.

I am now 34, father of three, and have never had another aneurysm since. 




 Buy a brand-new Ford F-150 extended cab. 




 Not a great combination.  Ew. 




 Nooooo!  I use this to get res all the time.  Don't ditch it. 




 "Blackie" only tested well in the South.... hehehe... 




 "Brunettie" didn't test well. 




 What the hell are these kids doing?  GET TO CLASS! 




 I laughed out lout at the end.  HAHA! 




 You're welcome.  It's been so difficult keeping it from my wife this entire time. 




 No, not really.  What kept me there was the job security, the pay, and the benefits.  Way better than the Papa John's job I had before. 




 Well, he was stabbed, and didn't die... so... does that mean it **did** happen? 




 I am an electrical designer for an electrical engineer. We do consulting engineering, and are mostly hired by architects to design the electrical portions of projects (e.g., lighting, power, mechanical connections, special systems, etc.)

I was offered a job by my potential parents-in-law. I started off answering phones, and making deliveries. I moved up to simply drafting other people's mark-ups. Now I do the design on my own.

I have no EE degree nor PE stamp, but I could go back in the future to obtain them if I wish. 




 Make sure my house is paid off, bills paid off, private school and college funds created, and then give the rest to family. 




 No, you aren't. The other games were incredible without the Batmobile. Why make an already-excellent formula even more complicated? 




 I can't get over the fact that you abbreviated it "TLOR" instead of the standard "LOTR" that most people use. 




 No they didn't; that was stupid. 




 What game is that? 




 That a video representation of the term: "nerdgasm". 




 How do the other Kingsguard not know it's him...?  Seriously?  It's not like 8'-plus men are common. 




 I'd assume that was the entire point of the scene.  Are they about to support her or capture her.  To be continued... 




 Aaaaaaand it's gone. 




 It's been pointed out about 10 times since last night. 




 Didn't know Olly was gay...  




 I also think that Brienne (known for hesitation) didn't kill him.  But every media source is claiming he is dead.  We might be wrong again. 




 Easy--she'll send FrankenMountain to destroy them all. 




 I'm sure they were promised safety and rewards... neither of which Sauron would have granted. 




 A-fuckin'-men! 




 What's even worse, is that if you look at the actual painting, it's not as if you can see nipples or labia or anything.  The closest they get is half a butt-crack. 




 Makes me remember the day I put my entire novel and resource guide collection on eBay.  All 119 books.  'Twas a sad day, but I needed the cash immediately. 




 Sounds like a good theory to me. 




 His parents are right.  This no-talent hack uses too much auto-tune.  It sounds horrible. 




 I just watched it 5 times in a row, and laughed every time.  HAHA!

Poor cat. 




 Um... have you ***SEEN*** "I, Robot"? 




 Oh, I can't wait!  We're renting a beach house there for vacation this year.  06/27/15 to 07/04/15.  I'm stoked!  As are our kids; they loved it. 




 Agreed.  He was my favorite part of the movie. 














 I'd say it with a "vee" sound, but that's my name, so yeah... 




  "One ring to show our love

One ring to bind us

One ring to seal our love

And forever to entwine us" 




 You didn't give any reasons for leaving Spotify.  You can build playlists, share music, and listen to everything on an Android with Spotify.

I use Spotify literally all day (at work, and when I sleep). 




 ...because the government gave credits for doing so.

You forgot that at the end. 




 Agreed.  Why is this news?  Who gives a crap what he does? 




 This is amazing, and it needs to be on the front page! 




 Why does it sound German?  LOL 




 Haha--so true. 




 Technically, it's the shape of a cross.  The crucifix has to have Jesus' body on it. 




 Holy crap!  That was awesome! 









 [Hot damn!](https://38.media.tumblr.com/54e089c37949080a2f782e47315a56ea/tumblr_nf77xf5Piy1r5lmfao6_500.gif)  In the areas suffering from drought? 




 Geez, that's kind of creepy, yet awesome. 









 Just because more girls play it doesn't mean more people want to watch it on television. 




  "Welcome to the crappy world of paying your own bills, sir."

HAHAHAHA!  So true.  These people don't know how hard it is to live when you aren't getting free shit from the government.

Downvote this all you want; it's true. 




 Simple.

You are empathetic. 




 Everyone is racist against some race to some degree.  To say that you aren't racist at all means you suffer from self-delusions.  If you sit back, and seriously think about your thought patterns, you'd realize that you are racist against *some* race for *some* reason. 




 The MLK Jr/Ghandi one was friggin' awesome.  Best closing line of ANY battle.  EVER. 




 So much talent... wasted.

Just a dirty, trashy, hood skank now. 




 Yes, that seemed a very intentional piece of dialogue. 




 The Lewis and Clark/Bill and Ted one was good.

My favorites are the ones with Key and Peele in them. 




 I was so excited to see this in my subscriptions page.

Then I was completely let down by the "meh" quality of it. 




 I noticed that as well.  Guess Drogon doesn't care about friendly fire. 




 True, but the fact that there is even a debate over this blew my mind.  They have rinsed my mouth out at the dentist after a brushing, so I've always assumed it was supposed to be done. 




  ... if you rinse with water after brushing your teeth, then you are rinsing away the benefits that fluoride provides to your teeth. 









 But he's not racist, because I've been told several times that a minority CAN'T be racist.....  




 They need to say that on the Windows 10 Upgrade program that pops up in the sustem tray. 




 Because it says "FOR A YEAR" when it should say "The free upgrade is valid for a year. After the year is up, you will have to pay to upgrade." 




 I've yet to see costs for the upgrade after the first year is over. Also, what happens after the year is up? Is Windows still usable to some degree? 




 Any suggestions? 









 ...and no one cares. 




 [They look normal to me...](http://i49.vbox7.com/o/378/3781e6cebf0.jpg) 




 1. Why didn't Vader just try and kill Palpatine at that point in time?
2. Why is this thread rated NSFW? 




 [...uh...huh...?](http://lexiedache.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/say-what-baby-meme.jpg) 




 A-frickin'-men! 




 It's the same where I live (in Baton Rouge, Louisiana). You aren't alone.

And I hate it when after making a generalized statement, people immediately come back and say "not all of them are....".  Yeah--no crap, there isn't a single thing in the world that is 100% the same across the board.

/u/promisejustcurious is simply stating that in the are where they work, black people seem to be disrespectful of people's time, money, and service.   









 My point exactly.  If he was in the act, you do it in a locked room with no way for anyone outside to get in. 




 Why would anyone not hide the fact they were gay if they lived in Iraq? 




 Confirmed: Mussolini founded ISIS.
