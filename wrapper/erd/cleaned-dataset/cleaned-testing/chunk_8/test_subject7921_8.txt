 Know of a guy who ran a car lot, he traded stock while he sat in his office waiting on customers and calls.  Said he made ALMOST as much money trading stock versus car sales, but at that time the car sales market was super shitty. 




 I like em. 




 Yes I have said this before.  I feel like a disease that can be visualized in some form is much easier to "fight" and explain.  A lot of people just flat out don't believe that depression exists, you're just a "downer".

Feel like the best contribution I could make to society is if I could take the diseases of a few people with me on my way out.  At least I'd help keep around "useful"/"good"/"worthwhile" people.
 




 Very often, since everyone else is more important than I.
 




 I haven't kept up with all the PC stuff, but I'd look further into your non-SSD hard drive choices to see if they have a high failure rate in the past.  Some of those HDs die off after 2-3 years in certain brands and that's a lot of data to lose.

PSU is probably overkill, BUT going to a lesser Watt unit probably won't save you THAT much money.  And if you ever get another video card you'll wish you had the bigger PSU.  And if it's high efficiency it won't be too much waste.

They have very detailed reviews on PSUs on some websites to give you better ideas on what you're buying.

 




 Have to say you make some excellent points booze.  If you don't present a good life to women as a man.......you're definitely seen in a completely different light.

Another thing is just that social media and this weird distortion to always present everything in a positive light because future employers/whoever can see what you say.......it creates some unreasonable expectations.
 




 I don't understand what is being asked for here.  I PMed to ask about it, but might as well post here. 




 The depression cloud says that the other shoe must drop and the job will taken away from you, or be the most miserable experience you've had in your life.

OR, something good happened, now where is all the bad?

That's how mine works, if you never get any good, then you never get any more of the really bad.  Just a steady level of bad.  You might not be happy, but you're not quite actively suicidal. (my thinking)
 




 Others judging you, feeling less than, assuming they think you are negative whatever, your achievements and things seem less important than theirs.

For me it ties heavily into depression and feelings of self worth.  If you're feeling like an especially worthless human being that day, the anxiety is worse.

I want to get to the "Not giving a fuck what others think/say" status that many functional and happy people seem to have.  I care faaaarrrr too much what other people think,  even people I barely know.

 




 Dont judge me for my alternative lifestyle! 




 A beautiful, intelligent, open, supportive SO/Spouse with some kink. 




 It's a fine line between love and hate as they say.....so perhaps hating them will make it easier.
 




 Hair looks amazing, just need to see your wonderful smile to go with it.
 




 If you run out of ideas of what to do with them, contact me. 




 Yeah this would be the one I'd first think of, but......you know what they say about assuming.
 




 Where's mine, friend?! 




 Tri-state area is.......................where? 




 *motorboat* 




 Yeah this post is pretty much a lie.  Ask for live pics, not even half of them have a profile picture that appears to be an actual person.  Saw peewee, a kitten, some sayings, etc.  And you get booted before you can type while they slap each other on the back for "regulating".

 




 Feel free. 




 Typed out a message earlier, never heard back.  Still interested in hearing your thoughts on it or a "No thanks" type reply.
 




 Bring out the wax and clamps, need to tame those sweater puppies.
 




 Might as well post my story, and it's one of a lonely guy.

I am 36 year old virgin.  Never kissed a woman.  I've been told I shouldn't bring up my virginity and just "fake it until I make it".  

Had a few girls I liked in high school, most only spoke to me when they wanted help with something.  I was invited to a dance(one where the girl is supposed to ask) by a girl in a grade above me, she was very shy like myself.  And I felt like I didnt belong at the dance, I doubt I made a very good impression on her.  And the next day I was teased by friends and others about going with her, I really don't even remember what was said...    but I was generally picked on a lot in school and everything just kind of internalized because of it even to this day.

In my last year of high school I asked a girl in my grade, she said she was "waiting on someone else", he eventually asked her.  Then she told me she should have went with me instead.  This same girl wanted to make a pact to get married at 30, and wondered if I would take care of another man's kids........I think she may have even asked how much I'd pay her for sex....really don't recall how serious/joking that was.

High school and college I met a little older woman online, and we emailed and spoke on the phone for years.  Went to meet her......I think second year of college, she was a state over.  It was awkward, she didn't act the same at all.  Stayed for two awkward partial days, cut it short by a night, and left early.  She told me I intimidated her by walking into her door without being invited in...I didnt even know if it was true back then.  But it was below zero out so it's a pretty good possibility.   Walking into that, the expensive of a hotel room, being in an awkward position with no experience, etc........then she says "Well I would have...." after I left.  Basically fell apart after that because I was hurt by the whole situation and that the years of talking did nothing to alleviate it.  I met her in an online game, she met with other guys from it within months of me meeting her.  I never heard what that situation was, but I always wondered if she had a couple guys in her back pocket and just hadn't decided on which yet.

College, was in a major that had maybe 2 or 3 non-foreign women, 1 was dating a dude who was cheating on her, another got hit on by first one's boyfriend which is how everyone found out about him doing that, and third was in a different program and I believe she was dating.  I don't recall.  I think I saw a fourth woman but she must have been only taking evening classes and her boyfriend picked her up all the time.   Anything non-major related was full of guys talking to the girls and sitting around them during class etc.  I probably could have socialized more, but I don't drink and I was a commuter who worked part time.   I spent a lot of time driving back and forth and working stupidly late at the computer labs.  

Got out of college, dotcom bust, the places I did work the people were generally 15-20 years older than me and if there was someone younger...she was ALWAYS dating someone or married.  So...... stuff happened.  I burned out on my job field.  Went to work at a family business and generally just felt like I had done what I was able.  I had decided no woman would be interested in me due to shitty job and obviously being "broken" as a man in some way.  Lived like that until the economy collapsed and life got worse, since it was a family business many of us in the family were straight up fucked financially for a good long while.  And I just stopped hoping for stuff and wanted to die, but was too afraid that I'd screw up killing myself and end up able to think but unable to move.  So I could just sit around and relive all the shit my life was.

Last year I started seeing a therapist, it's helped...but it's kind of a nebulous can't put my finger on it kind of thing.  Changed some meds for the depression recently.  Try as much as I can to not care what other people think, but it's just really ingrained.   Met a girl in an online game......talked for almost a year, got to be really close IMO.  She started dating a guy and that put a stop to what we had because I feel it's wrong to be that intimate with someone whose involved with someone else.  We're still in touch and friends, but that shit just eats my soul.  He's better looking than I, doesn't look like me in anyway.  I don't know his personality but she said he's generally nothing like me.  So......yeah.  I can't blame her for wanting something in the real world, but it doesn't make it suck any less for me.

POF and OkCupid, you might as well write your messages on toilet paper if you're going to bother writing anything IMO.  Even mutually "Liked" profiles won't get them to respond in my experience.    Even contact women on R4Rs and other things.  I've met some VERY nice women a little older than I, who are located outside of the US.  But it's just nice to talk to them.  In the US, this week alone I've had three stop messaging me after they received my picture....  that's assuming they write you back in the first place.  And you try not to tell yourself that people can't possibly be that rude, that maybe something came up....or they found someone else they liked more.   But common courtesy would be to write something back and say "Yeah I don't see this going anywhere....."  just something.    But you know they probably get raged on by other men if they do that, so I dunno what to suggest there.  

Generally, I find that even when I try to put the work in, read their listings, reply with something meaningful...even if I do get a reply they are pretty horrible about responding after the initial few messages unless you message them every day to kick it off again.   And they claim to like talking to you, but if  they like it so much you think they might remember to message you after the 5th or 6th day.  Hard not to feel like you're bugging or nagging them.

And this doesn't even cover the issues with the women having kids, or "complicated" situations with exs who might not be out of the picture.  Not that Im opposed to being involved with a woman (who I really get along with) who has kids, it's more hurdles for her and for you....and if the kids dad is involved that's another issue.......and yeah.

So........advice to future generations.  Don't do what I did.  Blow smoke up their asses, inflate everything you do so you sound like a superhero, outright lie so they think you are interesting enough to get to know.  Then you can "be yourself" after you've got a ring on it and a bun in the oven.  At least you'll have someone to be miserable with at the very least.  And I say that last paragraph in a joking/not joking kind of way.  Because often it seems like people in general just want you tell them everything is perfect, everything will continue to be perfect and you are the person for the relationship.  Like a job interview, which I also suck at.

And I agree with other comments made in the thread, a large chunk of women gravitate to a handful of men.  This is why you end up with the one guy that has 20-30 kids by as many women.  I think women kind of see it happening, but thinks they are better than that....or are too busy getting laid to really care either way at the time.  You hear about all the guys who are "interesting" once they are dating someone.....    like corporations who want to steal other corporations employees instead of giving the new guy a chance.  It's just bizarre, loyalty is apparently not a desirable trait any longer.
