 none - Sanders does, though 




 I'll believe a candidate who has a track record of being on the right side of issues their whole career, not one who is merely saying the right things at the right time to the right people.

Hillary's record has been one of siding with giant corporations.  Obama said a lot of things to please the ears of progressives during the primaries too.  People didn't pay attention when he was supporting telecom immunity (for spying) and Joe Lieberman over a progressive.

   These are deeply personal attacks and criminal accusations, and I think it's incorrect to immediately grant them credence because you disagree with ~~O'Reilly's~~ someone's political views.

 What do people do now when they get a hankering to watch any of the huge number of  popular flicks that aren't on streaming?  I can't bear shelling out to iTunes each time.

I brainstormed a bunch of favorite films, and then annotate which are available on Netflix streaming or not (I'm pretty sure most of these aren't available on Hulu/APV/Crackle):

* The Matrix (any of the trilogy)  - not available
* Hidden Fortress  - not available
* The Good the Bad and the Ugly - not available
* Vertigo - not available
* Sexy Beast - not available
* Divorce Italian Style - not available
* Lynch's Dune - not available
* Fifth Element - **available**
* The New World - not available
* Birth - not available
* Gosford Park - not available
* Barry Lyndon - not available
* The Royal Tenenbaums  - not available
* Jurassic Park - not available
* Lord of the Rings - not available

I honestly did this off the top of my head.   Just one film I could think of was available.

I'm one of the [10% that still has a Netflix DVD subscription](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/22/netflix-dvds-mail-subscription ) for this reason.  How does everyone else do it?  Or is the answer that a lot of films simply just aren't seen anymore by the vast majority? 




 Why is it necessary to keep trade agreements secret from the American people including the staff of elected Senators and Congressmen?  Why are our elected representatives not allowed to review the details of TPP with experts?

**EDIT**: Obama will say that the details are not secret, but this is purposefully misleading language.  Senators and Congressmen are technically allowed to view the bill, however, only they may view it.  They may not even bring staff members or experts in with them into the secured room in which the agreement is kept.  

The TPP is several thousand pages long, yet the only people who can view it, Congressmen and Senators,  may not take copies or even notes of what they read.  So Obama is saying that it is not "secret" in only the most narrow and technical sense.  He ought to be called out on this.  Why the need for this secrecy?  How can democracy work when the details can't be reviewed by experts?

Here are some good write ups of problems in TPP, based on leaks:

* The EFF documents a litany of digital rights issues https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp
* Senator Warren and others have pointed out that the international court which the TPP establishes allows corporations to bring complaints that would effectively override domestic laws.  Unions, environmental groups and others would be excluded from using the court, however.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kill-the-dispute-settlement-language-in-the-trans-pacific-partnership/2015/02/25/ec7705a2-bd1e-11e4-b274-e5209a3bc9a9_story.html

   That limits DVDs on their most fundamental level of "watching shit".

But my concern is the content.  Much of the streaming catalog is shit, by design of the movie industry.  They limit availability of a lot of the good stuff *on purpose*.  So DVD/BlueRay is the only way to get it.  People who rely only on streaming are either watching not very much or watching shit.

Obviously, I'd prefer a full catalog in streaming format.  And I agree with you about plastic discs - I can't bear keeping those things around. But I want to have access to a full catalog without feeling the pain of the purse each time I want to access something that isn't available on streaming (ie no to iTunes).  I'm just a bit surprised that more people don't feel this way. 




 So I'm a technology guy who has built a bunch of web and mobile systems over the years, I wrote a computer language, and am currently leading a team building a video ad marketplace.  

That bit about DVDs not disappearing is taken a bit out of context.  I mean that the business interests provide a reason for DVDs to continue to exist, not that technology can't address the problem.

So the truth is I'm probably quite a bit more technically savvy than many of the people commenting here.  I'm kind of crazy about video, which is why I want access to any and all content. 

I guess I'm a bit surprised that people are willing to accept technological limitations to what content they consume.   




 Thanks for that link.  Here's the bit that resonates with me:

 As well as the option of a film night, of course, it's also nice to have a choice of films you actually want to watch. The paradox of Netflix's successful transformation from a DVD rental company to a streaming video firm is that as its star has risen, the selection has got worse. The company's switched its focus from film to TV, where the rights are cheaper and standards are lower (admit it, you'd never watch a film half as terrible as that reality show you binge-watch religiously). It has started making high-quality original series, in an effort to steal some of that HBO shine. And it's perennially fine-tuning its recommendations algorithms so that the more obscure films it can afford to license end up in front of the right people.

TL;DR I've seen most of the good stuff on streaming.  I'm not a technophobe, but I guess I am cheap (i.e., can't bear to rent on iTunes). 




 Interesting.  I'm really surprised by this.  

So how do people get access to the full catalog of movies now?  I get like 3 DVDs a week from Netflix.  Do people just not watch as many movies now?  I guess the non-streaming catalog is effectively dead for most people?  Or do they spend a lot of money on iTunes?  At 3 movies a week, it seems like that would be quite expensive.  I mean there are tons of new releases that don't get onto streaming for *years*.  

I understand now that I'm in a tiny minority, but I'm also still completely puzzled.  What is normal user behavior? 




 Three times a week.  I'm kind of surprised that people are satisfied with the Netflix Instant/Amazon Prime Catalog.  So little of what I want to see is available on those. 




 How do you get access to all the movies that aren't streaming?  Netflix Instant is a tiny catalog. 




 What is a TV? 




 I think Apple's decision to provide *no* new models with an integrated drive is terrible.  There is no remaining product (other than this soon to be discontinued line) which supports what I imagine must be a fairly common activity: watching Netflix DVDs on your laptop.  

Using an external DVD drive doesn't cut it. The common situations for this: on an airplane, in a car, in bed make this a clumsy solution.   The other option - ripping the DVD - seems equally terrible.

One could argue that DVDs are going the way of the dinosaur, but I'd beg to differ.  The reason they still exist is not technological -- it's that way because of business interests.  Studios make money by limiting the availability of content.  DVD rental is an end-run around this lucrative system, so I find it hard to see how DVDs are going to disappear.  If you want a large catalog, you need easy access to DVDs.

Am I missing something?  Are there any good options?

**EDIT** "2012 Hardware", that is, according to the Apple rep I spoke to. 




 Looks pretty guilty to me. 




 Enforcement of contracts and protection of private property are a service provided by our justice system.  The people who benefit disproportionately are those who own property.  Protecting those "rights" is what allows a family like the Waltons to do very little work but extract the great majority of the value produced by their workers.

 




 Free protection services for contracts and property - police, judges, the whole legal system - is an entitlement... one mostly enjoyed by the rich.

 Looks like Maddow is part of the Clinton inevitability crowd.  

"Senator Sanders, let's talk about Hillary Clinton"

 




 Please, please peel back a few layers and find fossils. 




 I think you're looking at it the wrong way.

If he were elected, he would have a massive mandate. *Despite* massive money arrayed against him, the people actually chose him.  Despite years of red-baiting propaganda, people became so sick of the cheating that modern capitalism represents, they chose a Socialist.  Such a tactic would embolden Democrats that there is another way. 

As President, Sanders would essentially be the head of the Democratic party, and be able to support progressives over conserva-dems in elections (the opposite of what Obama has done the past several years).

As President, he'd have the bully pulpit to drive the conversation around issues that matter and speak plainly about the origins of our problems.  Conservadems like Obama took the energy of the left and turned it into disgust and cynicism.  

But Hillary is willing to lie for the duration of the primaries, much like Obama did, and Wall Street has her back because they know she's lying, and we'll all accept that because --- apparently, she's "electable". 

And thus does American politics continuously slide ever further rightward. 




 The lying Wall Street-serving harpie is electable.  Let's elect her.

 The perfect price of a movie ticket, from the consumer's perspective is $0.  And, that's not a ridiculous statement -- that is in fact the proposition that PopCornTime and internet bootlegs offer.   

So the question is - why are they saying any price higher than that ?   They are likely not saying this is the *most* I'd be willing to pay (because movie ticket prices are much more than that and ... everyone goes to the movies at some point or another, right?).  

Perhaps the consumers are thinking that it must cost *something* to make a movie, so they guess a price, but how are they in any position to know this?  The person who could have a meaningful opinion is someone who understands the finances of movie making.  They've just picked a number, which from a movie maker's viewpoint,  might be as ridiculous as saying "$0.01 is a good price for a ticket"?  In other words,  people are being asked to make decisions on something they can't make good decisions about.

So what exactly are we learning from this?
 




 It's definitely fun - a classic thriller.  I wish I hadn't seen it so many times already :) ! 




 Many great suggestions here, but some of my all time faves are missing.  

Here are some I consider must-see films (on any list).  I think these each represent the greatest work by each of these directors:

1. Hidden Fortress (Kurosawa) - the inspiration for Star Wars.
2. Black Orpheus (Camus)
3. Contempt (Goddard)
4. Divorce Italian Style (Gremi)
5. The Seventh Seal (Bergman)
6. La Strada (Fellini)

I would have put Night of the Hunter up here, but someone already mentioned it.

And now some other fun ones, concentrating on things you may not have heard of:

7. The Game
8. Kwaidan - 3 incredibly beautiful Japanese horror stories
9. Sanjuro / Yojimbo (Kurosawa) - inspirations for Clint Eastwood's  "Man with No Name" classic films.
10. Seduced and Abandoned (Gremi) - if you enjoy Divorce Italian style
11. Spellbound (Hitchcock)
 




   Keep in mind that Criterion isn't just a "great films" collection.

E.g., Armageddon.

 The question is why did HipChat not own this market?  They were there first with a very similar application.  I used HipChat at a couple of workplaces and it was infuriating.  Notifications were constantly lost.   I'd get a notification open HipChat and it would clear all the notification badges.  I missed so many messages this way.   It was impossible to tell when I should pay attention to something.  My coworkers and I even tweeted at the HipChat team asking them to fix the issues.  Crickets.   

Slack paid attention to the details.  It's an indispensable app, especially for coordinating with remote teams.   My company has 5 locations all over the country and only 25 people.   Slack makes it work.

 Lets remember that this nice old german lady whom the "commoners" choose to lavish with love is the world's top landowner in terms of space and value.  These monarchs managed to keep their title to vast lands by permitting a Parliament, but it only has power to the extent that it doesn't challenge the Royals' claims to their property.  It's a brilliant bargain - they get to continue having the same ownership that they enjoyed before "democracy" while also having the power to dismiss any of the peasants elected representatives.   

It is actually illegal to even speak against these landowners.  In N Ireland, high treason (punishable by life imprisonment) includes the following offenses: 
* attempting to deprive the monarchy of their title
* publishing that the sovereign is a heretic, tyrant, infidel or usurper of the Crown
* doing anything which might disturb or interrupt the sovereign's possession of the Crown

Yet the British peasantry have come to love them.

 Yet even this could be interpreted both ways.  From a conservative point of view, "Big Government" is the problem.  From a liberal point of view, "the state of government" (especially the Republican congress) is the problem.  

The poll shows respondents naming "dissatisfaction with government" as one of the commonly named problems, which leaves me confused.  This is so terribly worded.  It's hard to know what is meant.  Are people saying that "prevalent feelings of dissatisfaction with government" are the problem?  Or are they saying that "an overreaching Big Government" is the problem?  Or are they saying that the dysfunction of government is a problem?

 Israel has a sophisticated ethnic cleansing strategy.  Instead of a mass purge, which they know would draw worldwide condemnation that even the US could not ignore, they deprive segments of the population of basic necessities and human rights in focused doses.  The world pays less attention, but they have time on their side.  This is ethnic cleansing by attrition instead of by pogrom.  The effect is the same. 




 It has a little bit to do with who has disposable income and who pays whom to have careers in politics.

 I should be clear - the video does a very good job at explaining Weber's ideas.  I'm criticizing Weber.

 Agree, but in some places the numbers who want Sharia are also quite high (see this other chart from that article):
http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/gsi2-chp1-3.png

For example, in Egypt, 74% want Sharia, and 86% of those favor the death penalty for apostates - that's 63% of the population (!!!) 




 Some specific examples and quotes would help.

I literally cannot find any definitions of the sort you've given.  And then, there's the problem that the definition is vague.  You seem to be saying that some currencies are a function of the USD - so by pegged you actually mean "partially pegged".  

Anyway, it's really impossible to discuss this further without specifics.  You said "almost all" currencies are pegged to the USD.  What is the specific definition of "pegged"?  (Not a reference to some author who wrote something somewhere at sometime).  And what *specifically* are the countries that fall under this definition?

I've asked several times, and all I'm getting is hand waving.

 




  even when the polls show unambiguously that the majority support such barbarous things as the death penalty for apostasy. 

Wow.  Do you have a link?

Edit: I just learned about Google.

http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/

And the very WTF result you mentioned:
http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/gsi2-chp1-9.png 




 I can't find anyone who uses the definition of pegging that you do. 




  Just because something is "pegged" to the dollar does not mean it is economically static.

Yes it does.  That's what pegging is.  
http://money.howstuffworks.com/exchange-rate4.htm

 A pegged, or fixed system, is one in which the exchange rate is set and artificially maintained by the government. The rate will be pegged to some other country's dollar, usually the U.S. dollar. **The rate will not fluctuate from day to day.**

http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Currency+peg
 Importantly, fixed exchange rates do not change according to market conditions. It is also called a pegged exchange rate. 




 I think this says something different than you think it does.

 This action, referred to as the Nixon shock, created the situation in which the United States dollar became a reserve currency used by many states.

Being a reserve currency is *entirely different* from being a reference currency.  While pegging requires reserves, having reserves does not entail pegging.  

And the  bit you quote even says many previously fixed currencies  became free floating as a result of Bretton Woods, not the other way around. 




  Just about every currency in the world

Not true. It's mainly the oil-producing countries that do that:
http://www.investmentfrontier.com/2013/02/19/investors-list-countries-with-fixed-currency-exchange-rates/

 Bahrain,Jordan,Lebanon,Oman,Qatar,Saudi Arabia,United Arab Emirates,Venezuela, Hong Kong, Cuba, Panama, Eritrea, Djibouti, Bermuda


They're pegging their currencies to the dollar because the US has forced the world to buy oil in US dollars.  This boosts demand for the US dollar, increases its value and makes it more stable.  




 I don't reject the theory of low expectations, that's certainly a possibility, but I think other factors are at play too.

Saudi Arabia is worse on almost all human rights issues than other Islamic or Arab countries.  Even if low expectations mute criticism of Arab/Muslim countries, we'd expect the Saudis to at least get proportionately more criticism than Iran, Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and Syria.  So low expectations cannot be the whole answer.

I think the differentiator is the role of the press.  Saudi is largely kept out of the news because it is not in the interests of western officials to antagonize the dictatorship.  Official enemies like Iran, Saddam's Iraq and Syria are regularly castigated.  Journalists tell the stories of their leaders, and so the public in Britain and America hear bad things about our enemies, but not about the House of Saud, the unsurprising result of having a supine press which is largely reactive to the agendas of elites.

In Israel, the ongoing war has created a narrative independent of official western proclamations.  What is remarkable is that despite [western journalists'  biased coverage  in favor of Israel](http://timeswarp.org/testing-for-bias/ ) --- western populaces have seen through the ruse, perhaps because the obvious morality of the situation belies the official propaganda.  The house of Saud can hide their crimes as long as their land is untouched by strife.  Israel, unfortunately, has those pesky Palestinians it has stolen land from. 




 Saudi Arabia is allowed to do what it wants because the dictatorship has agreed to peg oil to the US dollar.  The deep relationships with elites in the US don't hurt either. 









 [This Annenberg study](http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070 context=asc_papers ) concludes that it is has a strong pro-Israel bias.  Here is a [summary](http://timeswarp.org/testing-for-bias/ ).

But - did *you* see the movie?  You asked me, I gave you specific reasons.  You could have refuted them.  Had I ignored, you might conclude you're beating a "dead horse".  But you didn't.  Instead you ignored what I wrote and told me I "post nothing but left-wing stuff".  It's not clear how these non-sequitors are supposed to change anyone's views.  

With regards to Frank Rich, and with my respect, I'd say that he's got an odd analysis of a critical issue.  Look at this passage:

 I would hardly call this film an endorsement of that war; its an endorsement of the Americans who volunteered to fight it. If anything, Sniper is the very opposite of a recruiting poster for further American military adventures in the Middle East. 

Rich is referring to PTSD issues and the horrors of war suffered by the soldiers. This certainly makes the film more interesting than most, but the deeper message is still reflexively pro-American.  American motives are always pure, and the suffering of the killers on our side is always noble.  American Sniper effectively glorifies the suffering of one of our sociopaths, and asks us to feel sympathy for him.

Indeed, Rich even acknowledges the relentlessly one sided perspective in the next sentence:

 The Iraqis are xenophobically and all but uniformly presented as duplicitous, indistinguishable savages (in Kyles lingo) unworthy of American sacrifice. 

Glorification of military members is a propaganda technique employed to put our military -- and by proxy our military adventures outside the reach of criticism.  A good summary of this argument is [here](http://www.salon.com/2014/11/09/you_dont_protect_my_freedom_our_childish_insistence_on_calling_soldiers_heroes_deadens_real_democracy/ ).  Unlike most of the more simplistic pro-US military films (i.e., [literally any which show US military planes and battleships](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2004/09/operation-hollywood )), this Eastwood effort represents a more cunning and noxious form of propaganda.  

From a moral perspective, it presents a pretzel-like logic, getting the audience to feel sympathy for the killer because of the stress he feels from all the killing he did, but none for those killed, a story still yet at odds with the reality in which the actual protagonist thrilled in his murders.  Eastwood is an incredibly talented filmmaker, and he's used his skills to teach Americans (yet again) to love and honor their military, to shed tears for them, instead of doing what they should: demand that they be held accountable for their actions and question the morality of enlisting in the first place.  
 




 And [the thoughts of that veteran](http://abcnews.go.com/US/tomas-young-iraq-war-veteran-antiwar-activist-dead/story?id=26846330 ) would run counter to the false narrative that Clint Eastwood and the rest of the GOP want to push. 




 **EDIT**: Bring on your downvotes.  You definitely don't have any arguments left to defend this propaganda garbage.

I did.  Did you?  It doesn't feel like it.

From the very first scene, the sniper is presented as someone who wrestles with moral dilemmas - do I shoot the kid who is carrying an RPG or not?  His buddy tells him he's going to be sent to jail if he makes the wrong call (for shooting a man who it is strongly implied is coordinating an attack against a US convoy).  The made up version of Kyle doesn't take the shot.  The very next scene we see the hero" Kyle as a boy learning from his father the  lesson about standing up to bullies, that we are told none too subtly is his life "purpose".

Either you haven't seen the movie or this heavy handed propaganda message isn't obvious enough for you: we're being educated that the US military and its agents are good moral people doing only what is necessary, the kind of people who "stand up to bullies".  Shortly thereafter, the twin towers come down... the themes are blunt and ideological, and serve their purpose.

The truth is the American military hides war crimes, invades countries pre-emptively, and its sniper-hero is actually a hate-filled racist sociopath who bragged that killing was something he "loved", who said everyone was a "bad guy",  "I hate the damn savages", and  "I could give a flying fuck about the Iraqis".

But, since it's important not to expose the American public to what the war and its "heroes" actually are, propaganda-Kyle is presented as a great guy with a hot girlfriend who just wants to "do my job when the day comes".  When the twin towers coming down, our newly married hero is off to confront the "bullies" who apparently did this to us in Iraq.  

And then there he is killing the little boy and his mom.  He was forced to, don't you see.  And the supine American audience drinks in the message: the American military is *forced* to kill all those civilians.  They try as hard as they can to avoid collateral damage, but they're sending their wives and kids to kill our anti-bully brigade!  All the while, Kyle makes kill after kill of bomb-carrying Arab, nearly getting sick after each shot, so moral and feeling a man is he.  Quite the opposite of the reality, of course, but such are the standard tools of trade of a propagandist.

The bullshit is thick in this one, but Americans are so full of it at this point that it smells like roses.
 




 The New York Times, the "fair and balanced" newspaper for coverage of Israel. 




 Portraying a lying sociopath as a military hero is what I'd call noxious propaganda, not "a good movie".

 It's called shamelessly scoring political points.  The Obamas are inoculating themselves against the jingoist rage that is constantly simmering beneath the surface of the American right. Embracing the lies of a sociopathic war criminal is a way of signaling, in the perverse reality of American politics, that they are truly and unquestionably patriotic.  The anti-war left is so obliterated and hopeless, that they can do this without shame or cost to their reputations. 




 Haaretz: [What exactly did Goldstone 'retract' from his report on Gaza?
Richard Goldstone's strange op-ed, in which he backtracked on his report claiming Israel targeted civilians, does not seem to be grounded in the UN's final report on Cast Lead.](http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/what-exactly-did-goldstone-retract-from-his-report-on-gaza-1.355454 )

 I asked Goldstone to help point out even a single word in the two reports that could justify his vague statement about the non-existence of the policy on harming civilians - while both reports repeatedly criticize Israel for not having investigated this issue at all.

 Apologizing politely, the South African freedom fighter said he had imposed media silence on himself.

We can only speculate on how this man was threatened. 




 Wow.  I hope they weren't just drinking too much coffee when they came up with this.   









 How is this off topic? 




 And look at what that did to pervert the priorities of his administration.  Not a single banker in jail, the too big to fail banks are bigger than before the crash, etc. 




 And they will be informed by Fox News that Obamacare took away their healthcare. 
























 Yet today, the reigning economic ideology asks us to suppress what nature has designed and be entirely selfish.  




  I don't think comparing the relative sizes really rebuts OP's arguments.

What arguments does it not rebut?

I assumed OP was arguing that the absolute values of these thefts tells us something about which currency is more secure.  *That* argument is pure bullshit, which the data I show above pretty conclusively demonstrate.

However, if you mean that OP has some *other* arguments, I might agree.  What are they?

 




 Markdown problem - I needed an extra carriage return.

Fixed now. 




 Can't find the tweets with Isabella Kaminska, so can only guess at your argument from what is posted here, which seems to be comparing the absolute numbers of the thefts to argue that fractional reserve is more risky.

But what do the absolute sizes of the thefts have to do with anything?

Euros in circulation = 956 Billion

Bitcoins in circulation = 3 Billion USD = 2.8 Billion Euro

**Stolen euros as a fraction of total in circulation**: 2B Euro /956B Euro = .2%

**Lost bitcoins as a fraction of total in circulation**: 5M  Euro/ 2.8B Euro = .17%

 




 Time to pull out the pitchforks. 




 Another possibility is that Republicans know exactly what they are doing.  Whether this costs us more *collectively* matters less than who ends up with relatively more after the distribution.  

When you look at their policies through the lens of labor exploitation things make more sense.  The more brutal and humiliating is the state of unemployment, the better deal an employer can make when signing a contract.  These fights are about the bargaining power of labor. 




 Let me add to that this  interview with one of the authors, which leads off with calling her a quack:

 Not for black folks.

But that said, this particular guy was acting aggressively.  Perhaps police in another country might have handled this without gun violence, but the dude in this video was clearly threatening the officer.
