 Also, I'd bet $50 you live in the midwest or the northwest.  




 That's [apple scab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_scab), caused by *Venturia inaequalis*. The tree is something in the apple family. Probably a crap apple.

Clean up all the leaves in the fall and burn them or give them to the city. Additionally you can spray a copper fungicide just before the leaves fall in autumn and spread a nitrogen fertilizer to help the leaves degrade.

I knew that degree would come in handy. Who wants a date?! 




 That looks like exactly like almost all HAM sites, too.

 It might be useful for something. Rhino horn made the Western Black rhino go extinct. And herbal "remedies" occasionally cause liver or kidney toxicity.

See!! Plenty of legit uses.

 How did you make it? Did you print a mould and cast it? Or make a negative mould from a print? 




 Fortune cookies and clams. Com'on guys. 




 Hmm, maybe violent drug cartels should get into brewing to diversify what they sell to Americans. 




 Gross. Did it work? 




 Ha! Wasn't that nuts? It was at least knee deep. I biked through it. It was fun, but I'll regret it when my downtube rusts out next month. 




 This is one of my favorite flowers! It won't grow where I am... 




 Haha, next time don't use The HufPo as a source. Does coffee prevent cancer too?!?! 




  

Is that really an interrobang?
 




 Me too, 




 It took me two years and I made made mine out of aspen. It's rained maybe a week straight in the Midwest.

 How many people did that and do you do that every year? I forgot who I talked to, but I remember someone saying that over the beers at the end. 




 I'm on youtube! All I had to do was ride down State nekked. 




 It was a lot of fun. My drop-down bars were not ideal. 




 I won't argue about what you want to do, but most named commercial strawberries are clones, usually out of tissue culture. 




 Well, with strawberries, you can propagate them asexually, so it doesn't matter.

Otherwise, breeders generally consider F7 lines to be inbred. 7 generations increases the homozygosity to 99.2%. 1-1/2^7
Once inbred, plants will generally come true from seed.

If inbreeding depression is a problem with the genera you are attempting to breed, then you need to select subpopulations as opposed to single plants. Say you make a cross, then grow all the seed from that cross. Then, select maybe half the plants and interbreed them. Grow them up again, select again. Each time you'll enrich in the genes you want without (hopefully) causing too much inbreeding. The minimum plants needed to prevent inbreeding within a population also depends on the genera.

So, you've got some research to do. 




 What is your climate like? Is it possible the tree has too much or not enough water?
