 Take my possessions but don't touch my fucking animals! 




 Looks like a diaper  




 Wow. Bet that guy with the ND got his shit rocked.  









 Nice bird chest fuck boy  




 Seriously hope English is OPs second language  




 You have lived a sheltered life  




 Sorry what did you say? Too busy looking at the legs in the background  




 Ohhhhhh shut the fuck up  




 And fuck? 









 They all float down here Georgey.. 




 She's so proud of it too  




 But won't you stay with him? 




 You're most probably right! 




 Top right looks like he's already finished the job..coughing that is.. 




 Welcome to Boothworld Industries. My name is Samantha and I will be your operator. Name?

 You should be off pudding  




 Shrooms are great too. I'd say more of a 'party drug' for sure. 




 See you there old sport. 




 Taken. 




 Because you forgot to subtract three! Dammit Karen! 




 LSD. 




 He's already done a number to your lawn I see.. 




 I've never had a bad trip but I've def wanted to sleep...most people smoke weed to help but you can usually only sleep 2-3hrs even doing that in my experience 




 We drop onto sour patch kids. It just depends on who you get it from and how they do it. I've also done hits off an eye dropper. 




 Yeah I can't sleep for at least 24hrs after dropping. Your brain just won't shut off.  




 Yeah it's all about having the right mindset and knowing what you're getting into. It's 12 hours (if you got good shit) that you're not getting out of once you start. 




 TIL how they did the makeup for Jabba The Hut. 




 Yeah I was stuck in one for two years...had to lie to her to get out of it. Don't stick your dick in crazy kids. 




 Fuck on a related note, I once put my contacts into a 'regular lens' case with that benzoyl peroxide solution because fuck directions...ya think I damaged my vision that day 0/10 do not recommend

 Fucking Scum! 




 Is this something out of the Jetsons? 




 He sleeps a lot...course think all newborns do.. 




 Yeah he's so cute...pain in the ass to get him to eat but he's a lil fighter! It also helps that my 60lb pit loves being a mommy  




 My wife is taking the lil guy tomorrow. Yeah our first cat was also a rescue and was 4 weeks old. She did fine and is now majestic and free :) 




 Yeah we're just hoping the little one makes it. His eyes arent even open yet I'm assuming  a week old.. 




 He's got a great coat! Do you feed him Blue Buffalo? :p 




 Sounds like an episode of cops  




 Yeah idk it was in our backyard with no other cats or kittens in site..my only guess is it was abandoned :(  




 So you're saying it was still totally worth it? 




 That's what I thought...men just buying the dildos for their women because they're too embarrassed to.. 




 Yeah we already had one...our first kitty was a rescue too.  









 Nah doesn't do that for me. Everything melts or swirls like the gif. 




 That time stands still and smoking a cigarette or making a pizza takes an eternity! And you can't sleep for at least 24hrs after...le sigh  




 Nah it ain't like that 




 My cat looks exactly like this when I trip. Majestic as fuck! 




 Amazing how close that is to what it actually looks like hallucinating  




 Username checks out

 Fuck you, OP. I'm a clown and you have no idea how much skill goes into making ballon animals.  




 First he looks half pissed, half loving it. Then he's all like awwww yissss don't leave betch! 




 He said "mustard on the beat hoe" 




 You're entitled to my cock 




 Bet he's a fucking muggle 




 Does his mom need a babysitter ayyyyy 




 People still drive those? 




 Go on.. 




 GEEKS RUN THE WORLD! Yes, but they're not getting their pee-pees waxed now are they? 

Dear God trololol 




 My legs are moving! But I feel like I'm not going anywhere! 




 Moister than an oyster! 




 Just ask Ron Burgundy. 




 They'll expect one of us in the wreckage brother!

 Not before sucking me dry  




 then inventing a phone to take selfies with a T-Rex

T-Rekt. 




 The liquor store, duh. \\\()/
 




 Just a small thing but police aren't required to do that anymore. They are more required to protect and uphold the law. 

Which is still protecting the public? \\\()/

 




 I like Ninja and his stream on twitch. However, when it comes to being competitive and playing other pro teams he can come off abrasive to other teammates. And Ark/Aries have the same personality so I think that's why it didn't work. I knew it wouldn't last long after watching them scrim online. I think I watched them lose like 4-5 consecutive games on stream  




 What...in....the fuckkkkk. Is this real lifes 




 It was focused...with a Kodak disposable camera. Or a potato.  




 They almost connect even when he furrows his brow.. 




 I really wanted WFX in the finals. Love their unique and aggressive playstyle. They got fucked by the refs in the end. Hopefully next tourney they place even higher! 




 I turned it off after all those restarts towards the end. Its ridiculous how many problems this game still has. 




 Dat rigor clitoris  




 It is an overwhelming sense of fear. To me, it felt like something very evil/malevolent was in the room. But I didn't see anything. It probably went on for 10 seconds then I woke up. It was very scary for me because it was the first and only time I'd ever experienced it. 




 A slithery one at that! 




 You need anal bro? 




 It's not their relative level of danger that makes them scary. It's that the fucking slither around and are so stealthy. Always there, always watching. Snakes and spiders...the ultimate voyeurs. 




 Holy shit that is the worst best thing I've ever seen.  




 Say hello to my lil friend! 




 Why do they have beef? Sorry don't read comics  




 In this case, hopefully the carpet doesn't match the drapes.. 




 That OP hates everyone? 




 Suddenly a kind Asian man appears  




 You should be a private investigator 




 You change my life! 




 Seriously, don't stop fapping me. 




 How dare the child stick up for his mother for using a drug that has shown to have therapeutic uses for a fucking disease she has.
