 Soooo.... Is anyone else as worried as I am that there hasn't been an update? 




 Your "boyfriend" seems like a total fuckwad. 

You definitely deserve to feel special on your birthday, and your 21st no less. Honestly, everyone here is right. You should definitely get yourself done up, and just go treat yourself to some breakfast, or brunch. If you can, definitely do a movie as well. Always a good help, and there are great movies out right now. 

We may be internet strangers, but you can always turn to us to be there for you. 

And your kitty really does love you. They can sense emotional stresses, and will help you through this. You're awesome, OP!! And happy birthday :) stay strong.  




 .....isn't it the three eyed crow? 




 It's count of how many have found this place and died. It's keeping track of how many people have perished in the chamber with no air. Soon it will read 12,109. 




 Soooo..... It sounds like you should move. Like now. Maybe move in with Anna somewhere new? That seems to be the only thing that would help. Unless they follow you.... As for any new owners to the house, well they can deal with the Ghosts or Demons, or whatever they are. Just be sure you're careful when moving.  




 Soooo...... My name is Will...... Shit.... Please don't come after my family.....

On a side note, I love that all your stories seem to have some sort of way for you to resolve them. You clearly care about all of your friends and family, and I respect that a great deal.  




 Is anyone else worried that we haven't heard from either OP or /u/solotopvladimir in a while? Because I'm starting to get really worried about them..... 




 As far as FU's go, this one is pretty mild. I agree with some of the others here, just make this your NoSleep profile, and make a different one for your personal account. That's what I did, I have a NoSleep profile, and this one. It always works out great. 




 .....did you castrate him at the time?  




 I actually kinda expected them to be awake and say she owed them money for staying in their BnB.... Like maybe she didn't realise what they said as she was so drunk... But hey, good things are good!!
