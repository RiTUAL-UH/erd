 Maybe so it doesn't "touch his lips" it isn't really drinking? 




 I think it could be something about not wanting the bottle to "touch" his lips.  If he squirts it in, maybe he's not "drinking"? 














 But then you also have NY cost-of-living, which negates it some.  









 Those type people are everywhere though..... 




 I had a PI go from a community college to a state college to finish his BS, to a PhD in the biomedical sciences at Yale.  It absolutely isn't a bad thing.  But you just have to prove yourself, like others have said.   




 :(  



















 It is nice to be able to message on my keyboard vs. typing on my phone.  

In case the developer is lurking, there are a few enhancements that would make this extension even better:

* When a message is received, have the Tab head flash
* The ability to sort your matches by current distance 
* The ability to sort your matches by last active
* The ability to see how many of your moments a person has liked.
 









 It's CHEWIE!!!

  "Claire wants more than being First Lady." 

Does that sound like Hillary Clinton-ish?  Could we see Claire run for president, a la Hillary? 




 It made me think of [King Abdullah of Jordan](http://isisstudygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/king-abdullah_jordan.jpg), but I am sure this happened way after this was filmed.

 Chocolate MiLK? 














 I wonder who they'll choose for their first pick now?! 














 This reminds me of Joe Moglia, the HC at Coastal Carolina.  He is the current Chairman and former CEO of TD Ameritrade.  And seems to be doing well there.  But there is a lot of difference between FCS and B10 football.

 I used the "**Memorize the 20 amino acids in 20 minutes**" Youtube video.  Some are kind of ridiculous, but sometimes it takes something wild to remember this stuff.
