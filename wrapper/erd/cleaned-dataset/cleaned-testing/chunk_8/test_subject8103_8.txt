 Classic album.  Found this [weird video of Dead Finks Don't Talk, apparently set against a 60's-era GM advertisement film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7BDS19H9OM).  Oddly complimentary to each other... 









 love this track...Fear of Music might be my favorite Talking Heads album 




 Wut? This is awesome.  Dude is such a unique performer, will be interesting to see where he goes. 




 Just checked out Bromst.  Solid stuff.  I feel like I've heard of him over the years but never took the time to listen.
