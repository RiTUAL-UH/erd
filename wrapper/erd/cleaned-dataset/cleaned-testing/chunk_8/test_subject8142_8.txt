 Well the lube means it's not happening often enough that he can go in dry. That might be comforting. 




 We really need to stop recruiting kickers. Interhall ones seem to work out pretty well. 




 Gotta drop 4 art references in every song. 




 Hibbert trying to show if Korver can get blocks, he can shoot 3s. 




 How does 47% of the class score above the middle 50%? 




 Aren't songs by people like Kesha and Pitbull also about having fun and living life? 




 Interesting, though, that he kept talking about out of state students, and threw out ND, Duke, and Northwestern as example schools, since none of them have out of state tuition. 




 I don't understand why so many middle class people seem to relate to Eminem, except for the fact that he's white. I relate to Kanye way more than Em. Though if all I cared about was relatability, I'd just listen to Asher Roth. 




 Can't feel good when employees of the network you're showing up on are calling you out, too. 




 Clearly he just suspects Chloe Bennet of being an alien. 




 Holy shit sums it up pretty well. 




 \#SwagOverload 




 Yeah, the problem with calling it gay is that it's too broad a statement. 




 Nah, it's all a conspiracy for some reason or another. Something something Kelly antichrist. 




 So humble. 




 Boston Pink Floyd is best Pink Floyd. 




 Why do people still want to watch music videos on TV? We have youtube, there's no reason to wait and hope the right one shows up. 




 Well Girl Meets World is starting soon, so maybe that takes care of one of them. 




 Between DGB, Ronald Darby and Seantrel Henderson this past week, I don't feel as bad about some of the guys we missed out on. 




 Well they don't need another one. Oden fulfills the injury prone center requirement. 




 At least in college, they do have some differences. The shot clock is 5 seconds shorter which leads to quicker possessions. Women's basketball also tends to have a lot more off ball movement. 




 You also have to take into account costs. 10% is going to your agent. 50% is going to taxes. You also have extra medical and nutritional costs the average person won't. And those medical costs especially are probably going to continue for the rest of your life. 




 Is Evan Turner one of those people who can find everyone's biggest insecurities and targets his own team before the game? That's the only explanation I can think of. 




 I think the only pills I really took while I was in college were ibuprofen when I was hungover. Might have taken benadryl once. You should be fine. 




 I'm glad Bieber called a conference of himself, Nicki Minaj and Chuck Norris to discuss music. 




 They're not even the worst power conference team in the state. 




 I usually just hop up out the bed and turn my swag on. 




 We used to have paintings, now we just have graphs. 




 How do you not include who shot Mr. Burns as a memorable moment? 




 Em literally has a skit called Bitch. 




 Half of those were in the 2000s. 




 It's not like Disney's still coming out with good movies like Frozen or anything. 




 I think she knows the words about as well as I do. 




 But I have seen a lot of very special episodes from the late 80s and early 90s about how no means no. 




 My favorite moment of his at ND was when he ended a tweet with \#GunnerKielQuotes. 




 To those who know Notre Dame, no explanation is necessary. To those who dont, no explanation will suffice. -Lou Holtz 




 His name was Hans, what were you expecting? 




 This girl doesn't want to date me, clearly she's hiding her feelings for me. 




 I had someone in a history class ask how many African Americans there were in some European country before realizing how stupid she sounded. 




 And it's not just the second contract. Long term it gives you an extra year towards your pension, as well. This doesn't matter as much to the stars, but it'll help out the career backups a lot. 




 You can still get channels over the air for free if you live in a big enough city. 




 Can't say enough good things about this. Highly recommend. 




 I can live with that. 




 Went to a college with single sex dorms. My on campus job had a student manager that was trans. He was a senior who had been gradually moving towards male and by now could pass pretty well. I made a comment to a freshman about how he was friends with a girl because they'd lived in the same dorm. Didn't even think about how that would out him. 




 He should just bring out his seatless bike. 




 [If you don't judge my golds chains, I'll forget the iron chains.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSurzeGvPrQ) 




 And the state of Indiana is now eliminated from the tournament. Hoosier Hysteria took a step back this year. 




 What about the Monkees? 




 Why do you think she's awake at 6 am on a Saturday? 




 It wouldn't be the [first time he tried something like that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD380XDs-NY) 




 LenDale White was a solid RB. 




 I think the problem is a lot of people don't understand his rhyme scheme. A lot of his bigger songs have lines that end with the same word, especially the n word, and they don't realize it's an internal rhyme. 




 He doesn't really have knee issues, he has playing military academy issues. They'll take out knees of anybody. 




 The fact that she was considered a booster is kind of ridiculous. 




 The only player I'd rather draft is Louis Nix. I'd be really happy with Do It Tuitt though. 




 Playing catchphrase with Big Lou is probably one of my favorite college memories.  




 But we play Navy therefore our entire schedule is invalid. 




 When I lived in Bloomington, the KMart I worked at accidentally got a huge shipment of Oklahoma gear instead of IU. 




 I see. 




 That would explain the Anna Nicole update headline. 




 The thing is though, Kanye's audience is much more middle class 20 somethings than a lot of other rappers. Honestly, Kanye, at least his early stuff, ought to be way more relatable to a white middle class 20 something than say Eminem, unless we're just basing on skin color. 




 It also depends on the company. If it's an up or out company, that might be a perfectly reasonable thing to say. 




 What if Ted already died and Bob Saget had brain failure. They did an experimental brain transplant and Ted is now Bob Saget.

 But if you lose your virginity before you're 30, you'll never be a wizard! 




 I'm almost offended by the lack of Kanye in this. 




 I'm a huge Blink fan, but I'll be damned if I'm going to count them as real musicians, and not count someone like Bruno Mars. The only member of Blink-182 with a ton of talent is Travis Barker (who I might does a lot with hip hop on the side). 




 This is a really specifically timed picture. A point in time where teenagers had cell phones, but before teen mom. 




 Obviously one of his real life struggles is bitches. 




 I never thought I'd see the day there were 2 Bears on a list like this. 




 It's not even the cut blocks. It's the god damn receivers diving at our corner's knees after the whistle 30 yards from the fucking ball. Wash rinse repeat for other positions depending on the game. 




 Man Fairly Oddparents is fucking awesome. 




 Public schools do, too. Oden got approached about moving an hour away to Indianapolis while he was in middle school. 




 I think I can safely say enough time has passed and Encore still isn't that good. 




 I swear half the songs off Blinks first 3 albums are about sex. And that's probably a conservative estimate. This is a band that wrote a song about Ben Wah Balls for fucks sake. 




 This whole picture is 90s clothing. 




 Since when has Em been at the top of rap this whole time? He released 3 great albums in 4 years, then waited 2 years to make one with a huge drop off. Then waited another 5 to make one that even dropped a little further. He went 8 years without a good album. If you want to make an argument for sustained success recently, Kanye has a much better case. 




 Parents picking up was awful. Only slightly better was a sibling. 




 I didn't realize there were actually people who wore top hats. 




 Heads up 7 up that's the way we like to fuck. 




 Should probably be able to spell Bel-Air, too. 




 That's just because we're godless and legalized abortion. 




 Also fuck TV refs. I hate those damn orange gloves. 




 You say no to ratchet pussy, Juicy J cant! 




 Shitty chicken dinners were a huge social issue back then. 




 Yeah they played this on Elvis Duran the other day. 




 Yeah a schools now are even combining their library schools with computer science and informatics. 




 He had a hell of a 24 hours when he took that. 




 I'm sure it has nothing to die with 2004 pop culture having been easier in 2004 than in 2014. 




 Freshman year I went to a lot of similar parties. I had a group of drunk friends that I saw at every party but never anywhere else. 




 We called it Kario Mart. 




 Flocka is one my favorites for pregame music. So hype. 




 You despise racism and yet your first thought is that he's just an angry black man? 




 I'm pretty sure the Duck Dynasty guy's interaction with black people back then is pretty much limited to having seen Song of the South. That's the only way I can see how he got that view. 




 HS running back, still plays like one when he gets the ball. I love Golden. 




 Eli and Peyton need to work out whatever differences they're having. Clearly we have some Freaky Friday body switching shit going on. 




 And neither are his real voice. 




 I would probably find it cute the first time. Might get old though. 




 I wanted to be one but my first grade teacher couldn't spell it so I had to want to be an astronaut instead. 




 We had something like 10 NFL players on defense that last year with Weis, too.
