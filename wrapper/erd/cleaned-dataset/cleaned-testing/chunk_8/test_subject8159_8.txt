 I just tried to make this using the pattern. It said it made 6 legs, but it really only seemed to have room for 4. How did you alter the pattern for the legs? You did such a great job! 




 My boyfriends mortgage is in his name, so he pays the mortgage. I pay utilities, cable, internet, trash. We go every other on groceries and split vacations down the middle.  




 This happened to me once. I was working with a piece that started with 150 ch, so it was pretty big. I didn't want to tear my work out, so I ended up single crocheting down the side that had the dropped stitch(es) and back. It looked like a repair, but I was glad to have a fix that didn't require undoing 8 hours of work.  




 I'm assuming so. It's just a fabric glue, so in sure any brand would work. It is in a tube so it is easy to control how much you use.  




 I usually use a little Liquid Stitch on the knot. Creates a slightly tough area, but at least I feel like the knot will hold!  




 This is amazing! Did you make it up or use a pattern?
