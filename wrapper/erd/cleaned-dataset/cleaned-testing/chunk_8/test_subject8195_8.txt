Sticky a vote 




 I just don't see how it's a big deal or why small subreddits would matter. 




 Awww why are we going private :'^( 




 What? 




 Uh.  
K. 




 wat.  
You made the subreddit? 




 Our autistic message must be spread.  
This will not do. 




 Pls no 




 Uh, come again?  
Use an airsoft gun as a fish tank?  
Buy fish tank and use as airsoft gun?  
Buy fish tank and use as real tank? 




 \Denial 




 I like HK guns because they have a certain style, new and old, that appeal to me. 

I like the G36 platform because of how the magazine looks. I also think the handguards are a good combo with the stock. Just look good together to me.

I like the look of G3 rifles because of the slim look of the handguard paired with the large 7.62 magazine. I think they pair well together.

I like the MP5k and MP5 series because of the weld marks (Same with the G3 I guess). Along with the handguard I think it gives it a simple, no bullshit look. 

I like the XM8 because it looks like a fish, and it has a futuristic look that appeals to me.

Finally I like most 7.62 platform guns (FAL, G3, SCAR-H) because of the larger magazines. To me, it gives it a sturdy look. This one is harder for me to explain, but that's a good way to put it.

Those are my raisins.  




 Yeaaaahhhhh Dealiest Warrior is definitely sketchy.

 If it's done right, it'll look good.  
As with any paint jobs. 




 K slayer 




 Eh I'm good.  
I'm not a fan of HK pistols, and I'd probably get a GG UMP if I got a UMP 




 Magic. I shoot with magic.  
And by speed up that travel, what gats do you have? 




 I could see maybe dolphin could pass, but I thought the general consensus was it's a boat 




 FN2000 is boat 




 I had a dream once that I was swimming in an ocean and XM8's were the fish 




 Man... It was that long ago?  
Heh. 




 Oh. Well the STG.58 sounds cool. 




 I heard that Madbull was working on one 




 You could find a KA L1A1 or the Ares L1A1 somewhere? 




 Sig 551-chan best raifu 




 Once I get another HK gat I'm gonna move to FN 




 I researched it a really long time ago lol
 




 Turns out the breed of fish (Oscar Cichlid) I bought grows really fast and it needs a ***fifty gallon*** tank to live comfortably. Also, I guess it will grow up to twelve inches long. 

HK-sama's gotta wait  :'^( 




 I'm already a major in Meme Science and a minor in Rare Pepes bby 




 \Not being able to use dank arrows  
\Not getting free college 




 You are average pleb.  
You have not yet accepted the grace of HK. 




 I have XM8 above. XM8 is best fish gun. 




 Alright, thanks. I'll just delete the post so people don't get too upset. 




 The bubbles just stayed from yesterday and haven't dissipated.  
I should have said I got the fish today, and the tank yesterday lol

I filled it yesterday and let it cycle and stuff all day yesterday, and added the water conditioner and stuff.  




 I got into it from watching the OP and figuring, "Huh sciency stuff, alright" 




 That's why the show gets a lot of hate, but I loved the slice of life beginning and the mind fuck ending. It's definitely my favorite anime. 




 Yeah I cycled the tank and did all of the stuff I did with my first tank. I planned on keeping this tank set up for another month and saving up for a larger tank. 

When I get a larger tank I was planning on getting a clown knife fish, which I originally wanted but figured an Oscar would be good for now. 




 Did I do something wrong..? 




 I will put cameras on them and mount gats 




 Also [the KGB never used it.] (http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/List_of_firearms_used_by_the_Armed_Forces_of_the_Russian_Federation) 




 [Bam.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0korpion_vz._61)  
"Czechoslovak submachine gun developed in 1959"  
"Adopted by the Czech army and security forces, and later exported to various countries."  
[Also in the list of people who use it, Russia isn't even there.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0korpion_vz._61#Users) 









 The Scorpion isn't Russian, but it's Czech so you could say East Bloc kit 




 East Bloc kit. That'd make sense if you said that. 




 Ayy 




 Great username by the way 




 [They did do a really good job on this show] (http://i.imgur.com/7o9weSX.gif) 




 Poo everywhere.  
If I were there I'd take a secret floor poo somewhere.

 Ha. I got that reaction picture on one of my imgur accounts too. 




 I have a webm of this saved. This is kind of what I imagine it'd be like if this happened to me, expect all I have is 300 GB of flashdrives in weab shit.  
It's nice to have a youtube link, thanks. 




 I've been listening to a lot of regular boss nova music after finding [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1puc4EMP9olist=PLJIhLbDdr8NNJTCNy2E3PXxySkz7TK0MWindex=2) in a /v4c/ thread and just found this playlist.  









 Ohhhh that's awesome.  




 Do you think he'd base it off the VFC or something similar, or the WE? 




 It's a metroid 




 ***DJ KHALEDDDD*** 




 GO BUY YO SELF A HOUSE 




 **GURL YOU SMAWHT** 




 Dolphinately 




 Mine is [space AUG] (http://i.imgur.com/IUYQUFy.jpg) now. 




 Yeah, after awhile I was like, "This gun is shit"  
Then I got a JG AUG 




 I started with a Crosman Gameface AK lol 




 [It's almost to regular sport-line AEG and then it falls short] (http://www.evike.com/products/48536/) 




 ^^^^^Yes. 




 **Yes.** 




 Oh I didn't see that hat part and assumed you were talking about the gun since it's shiny, and hats aren't. 




 But it has the add to cart option for some reason lol 




 Should've saved up a little bit more to get the other sport-line G36 model that Umarex sells 




 It's because it's that cheap springer/lpeg combo G36 that Umarex sport-line makes 









 Fun 




 YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE~ 




 What really happens if you swallow magnets? I wanna know.  
One time I ate a triple A battery and it never came out.  




 *memegarchy 




 If you watch the full video with volume then the part with the gate makes more sense. I thought it was zombies, but the guy up against the fence is her father helping her escape from some sort of rebels or combatants.  









 Prolly 




 Nope

 \tfw you don't know what I mean when I say "robot" in that context 




 \tfw you aren't even living by yourself/you're a minor and still act like a robot 




 Other than work and airhard I pretty much stay home lol 




 Fun show all around only into episode 3.  
I also thought, "Man what if Tamako was at school or some shit, and the whole shopping district was carpet bombed while she was gone"

I need to go outside.  




 I've heard wonderful things about it. 




 srry bb 




 Ask /u/Catbrain then lol 




 Ha. Sorry.  
I'm guessing you're just a random dude who doesn't airsoft and gets a lot of annoying messages from people who think you're /u/Catbrain lol 




 Airsoft World is a popular UK retailer.  




 \Not torrenting everything 




 I watched the whole series subbed first, and then dubbed and it's still my favorite anime. 




 Ask /u/Catbrains then lol 




 I've played for three years and now my walls are covered in guns lol 




 Asides from the corrupt government and the forgotten species of time? 




 Yeah it's the official.  
I agree that they didn't get the same level of emotion, but I think it's one of the best dubs I've seen. Also, I thought the voice was very suiting.  




 Yey

 Nah KV is the different stock. 




 I am rich in memes 




 Only difference is the bucking, and motor. Echo 1 SOF 2 comes with an Echo 1 motor. 




 Isn't this only the K since it has the skeleton foldy stock, and not the full foldy stock? 




 Is that a Psycho Pass reference? 




 :'^( 




 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

 G36-chan best raifu 




 So she FAL into his trap 




 Did it FALl down? 




 Did she FAL in love? 




 AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 




 [And it worked] (http://imgur.com/a/dIDRF) 




 Stupid SD card port won't work.  
I'll make a post tomorrow lol 




 Lemme grab le camera 




 I love everything HK and I like Bundeswehr gear, but I'd never think  of doing a complete loadout. I have a set of Tropentan BDU's but that's probably as far as I'd go lol.

Also are you sure it's the G36E or the standard G36? I thought my G36 was a G36E, but the bayonet lug is the one on the standard G36. 




 Oh the WE Open Bolt GBBR G36's have stickers of those trades there.  
Nice to see another airsofter delving into the beautiful world of HK.  




 What's the gun..?  
The sticker makes me think WE, but it also looks exactly like my G36 by JG so I'm confuse.  




 Ha. Cool.  
I met a kid and asked if he airsofted and he showed me one of those Cybergun FAMAS's, and he said what guns do I have. He about shit his pants when I turned my laptop and showed him my gun walls.  




 Meh 




 Yeah at the end of the URL I saw "poo" and I had a good laugh.

 I actually made it a little louder there to make it seem like he's trying to talk over him. 




 Zeus. It's Zeus. 




 But J.C. Staff is great.  
They did an amazing job on Sakurasou and Toradora. 




 I'm waiting for Durarara X2 this coming 4th and Gakkou Gurashi on the 10th, so I'm set. 




 Yeah I still got feels while editing it 




 It's pretty comfy and sometimes I wear it in the winter
