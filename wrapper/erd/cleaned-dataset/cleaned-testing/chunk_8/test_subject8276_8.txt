 I hope he doesnt have that kind of role but sadly I think thats whats gonna happen, I mean arent they already shooting it now??? no actor is cast yet.  




 Yes its nice that they got these d list characters in the comics like Guardians or the Inhumans to big shots in the MCU. I cant imagine how awesome it would be to have all of the rights to the characters but honestly they dont need X Men at all its fine in its own universe and the movies are doing great, I only wish that the ff had reverted would have loved to see galactus and silver surfer in Infinity War.  




 Alright.  




 good choices.  




 didnt kill himself??? say he turned himself in and spent the rest of his life in prison would that have been a good end???  




 That would have been cool to see him.  




 yay finally someone agrees with me!!!!  




 Shes a fug who blows someone to get more exposure.  




 yeah thats the only downside to it really its like a tv show ya know except if a tv show had big budgets and different mediums.  




 Oh I wish I had seen this one in theaters I remember seeing the posters and stuff when i was 8 and I wanted to watch it so badly.  




 Aha sure.  




 well we will see about that.  




 I think this is the main reason most directors dont return for marvel sequels and stuff.  




 he would be awesome as bond.  




 the best explanation.  




 LOL so much like the sony hack and the Interview LOL.  




 Those are the titles thank you.  




 Will Smith would make a good villain.  




 A movie called Give em hell Malone there is a villain on there who is almost just like The Joker I forgot his name though, man I need to watch that movie again it was good.  




  Gonna get some heat for this but Megan fox  




 Yeah true and true  




 I hope they give it a rest for a few years and then reboot it with a whole new cast.  




 Yeah they really had something interesting with Freddy vs Jason but instead it was just the one film.  




 You forgot Ross and rachel.  




 Yes it is.  




 Because all of his films are so generic and have the same type of humor with the same actors pretty much and Sandler never really "acts" in his comedies. IMO besides his dramatic stuff everything since Anger management is shit.  




 Because he isnt.  




 Yeah I still wish he had stayed.  




 Armageddon every time I watch it it feels like I am watching it new again.  




 Because the expectations were to high and most people think it fell flat and wasnt a worthy ending to the series. personally I like it not as good as TDK but still good.  




 1) watch the other movies 
2) watch the other movies
3) watch the other movies
4) Watch the other movies
5) watch the other movies 




 cool.  




 Cool  




 Yes  




 He probably retired or something.  




 I love that scene I wish i could watch it in the theater again.  




 yeah they could make it a dramatic thriller or something.  




 I always thought a movie about Chernobyl would be cool.  




 Whoa thats cool.  




 yes they are.  




 UGH just make the dam movies already.  




 O thank god I dont live there LOL  




 Stupid fat Hobbit he ruins it!!!!!  









 And Marion Cotillard said the same thing during production of the Dark Knight Rises.  




 It was nice to finally see him again hope to see him with a bigger role in the next films.  




 yes indeed  




 Because its so intense and has good performances.  




 What are some cool ideas for the 8th film??? I know it will likely just be Diesel and a few others obviously no Brian either. New York sounds cool.  




 The Dark Knight  




 The Lovely Bones I know everyone hates it but I always liked it it is my favorite movie ever.  




 Yes please  




 It will likely never happen there is more of a chance of a godfather part 4 than Hellboy 3.  




 Such an awesome movie!!!!! I loved it!!!!! great sendoff to Paul at the end I was almost in tears.  




 He was awesome!!!!!!! Lol I am your father and some of his lines were great  




 HAHAHAHAHAHA  




 Funny episode.  




 Every episode??? Holy shit the most I ever watched was 10.  




 My name is weiner, my name is weiner.  




 Those Wolves seem pretty weird.  




 Ba ba dook  




 Alright  




 Of course my sister lives in NY im in AZ and I wanted to find it so she wont have to pay a whole lot when she visits.  




 Really?? Weird I thought it was a good site.  




 Yes thank you!!!!!!!!!!  




 I read something a few months ago about a website that is run by some indian college student and it has the cheapest flights ever. I believe that it is so popular that all the big ones want to shut it down. what is it???  




 Release order no other way.  




 that would be so cool.  




 If I am watching a brand new movie then I wont look at my phone much, when I am rewatching a movie then yes I do it more often especially at the boring parts.  




 I should have saw It Follows I mean it was okay but not that much the best thing about it was will and kevin.  




 Thank you  




 240 and ive been looking into exercising and loosing weight I just need the right mindset.  




 Okay sounds good  




 Should I watch this or It Follows this weekend?????  




 That would have been an awesome ending.  




 Yes it will hopefully anyways I do wish Edgar Wright was still around though.  




 I also wish they had shown another MC besides the mayans that the sons would war with like full blown criminals/killers. Kind of like an evil version of samcro.  




 I wish they had just killed him I wanted him to die for what he did.  




 He was cool nice and quirky and stuff. Wish he came back for at least one more episode.  




 Looks better than i thought it would cant wait!!!!!!  




 I laughed so hard at that part I rewound it like 4 times!!!!! At first I was like oh a long musical scene cool then bam haha.  




 Yeah I remember that year and honestly the oscars are nothing more than a big poularity contest and all the winners are the ones that kissed so much ass just to get a nom I wish by some divine miracle superhero movies would win some major awards but that likely wont happen.  




 It seemed like they were good friends before thats why their scenes mean so much.  




 Yes thank you for proving my point.  




 he wasnt really a list in a way plus he is getting steady gigs here and there so thats something.  




 They could have just stuck him in supporting in Foxxs place that year and since you said foxx is more of a lead anyway then it would have been cool.  




 Its annoying how he wasnt nominated for that one but freakin jamie foxx was.  




 HAHAHA Brittas musical scene!!!!!!  




 Thats a sad movie.  




 OMG good story I understand it now.   




 WOW and thank you means a lot.  




 Hes a really good actor I hope he gets some good film work in the future.  




 Really  




 Yes shes good in it I fell in love with the character fast.  




 Sometimes I wonder what it is like to be an attractive female like Scarlet Johansen or jennifer Lawrence. I just wonder what all of the attention will be like. Instead I am an overweight guy with lots of health problems I have barely any friends and the ones I do rarely call me anymore. I am also a virgin.  




 The Lovely Bones I know people dont like it or at least most of them but I actually really liked it and it is to this day my all time favorite movie.  




 Yes  




 Set it in Space and have him save the earth from terrorist aliens.  




 I cant wait to watch it!!!!! When I get some free time that is.  




 Thank you lady you saved my life!!!!!!!!!!  




 Sounds about right.  




 Also my Birthday  




 I LOVE it been doing it for years I mean I like going with other people too but I am just so used of being by myself nowadays that it works then.  




 Yes she is indeed a tool I do think she is hot though.  




 I usually notice things that I havent the first time.  




 Just get Hulu and Netflix and you will be entertained for a long time.  




 Bitch Lobatomized Jack!!!!!  




 Oh yes I hated him in that one just a big jerk.  




 Ill check it out  




 Yes Thank you so much yahoo Screen!!!!! I cant be more thankful for bringing one of my favorite shows back!!!!!  




 An editor and its usually the producer.
