 bruh I love REDALiCE 









 But u-play is so stable and gives you rewards! /s What's that? You want to be able to use your steam friends list instead of your U-play friends list so it will actually be easy to invite your friends to your ghost recon future solider co-op game? Fuck you..... 









 Schranz! It's a kind of hard techno that focuses on distorted rolling beats rather then just kicks

 Doesn't Mat have a DnB alias?  









 it just fucking happened....... my first soundcloud advertisement, it's happening..... 




 D4 MOTHERFUCKERS!!! GIVE SWERY YOUR LIFE ENERGY/MONEY!!!

 Thank you robot

 Does anyone know where I can download this track? I've been looking everywhere for a download and I can't find one (I really don't want to rip it off of youtube) 









 here you are! they linked a mediafire DL in the comments http://www.mediafire.com/download/qwwwa4wv7eb7469/Sinister+Souls+-+Jaw+Crunching+Beats+And+Subs+Samplepack.zip 









 we need more J-core!! 














 I'm one of those people who has to do every side quest and I always end up not finishing the game! What are some ways I can prevent/stave it off? 



















 I love the hard dance sceen and I want to see it grow! It's no problem :) here are some lables! SKRD and Splitterblast (created by Loffciamcore and Kurwastyle Project respectively the latter is no longer active but the website is still up and everything on both SKRD and Splitterblast is free!), For you sounds (you's lable, anime remixes as far as the eye can see and their all free!), mob squad tokyo (Japanese lable, lots of physical only releases, might have to result to doujin websites) Massive Circlez (Japanese), Kinzok On (Japanese), Psycho Filth Records (Japanese), Traxstorm, Hardcore Italia, MOH, Scantraxx, Dirty Workz and Enzyme 




 I'll give more names later!

Phew that should be enough to get you started (their are a lot more artist that I know of but I'm only one guy ;) ), if you want labels and links to free compilations and stuff let me know :)  




 https://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/2yfzlp/nnn_message_gabber_2014_japanese_hardcore_is_so/cp9ljd4 




 Let's all have a LAN party at the big yellow joint 




 I think you mean it's.......... "Perfect" 









 Wipeout has a fucking sick soundtrack! 




 Kobaryo is a fantastic Japanese hardcore artist, check him out if you like hardcore! 




 watch out bro, Konami might come to your office and smash that thing  




 I can't seem to find it anywhere :/ (sorry for the dumb question) 




 I literally just found out as well, I was poking around his discogs page and I saw Srezcat under aliases, he just released a song as both Kobaryo and Srezcat called speed complex on the latest Massive Circlez compilation, fingers crossed for more tracks soon! 









 seamlessR makes really good neuro DnB stuff and hes trying hardstyle for the first time. His tutorials have helped me a lot but I don't think this is going to go well for him  




 Ok, I've been trying to make a hardstyle kick for a long time and I always end up with a hardcore kick. I love hardcore but I really want to make hardstyle. [Heres a FLP of a kick I'm proud of,](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yliwda51u5vzemr/AABoYYwwTJrVy8lnVV1OhSr2a?dl=0) let me know where in the fx chain I go wrong! Also do what you want with the kicks  




 sadly not everyone appreciates the skullfuckery that is crossbreed  









 Thanks dude! I'll be doing more of these for sure, I started Re-sampling some picks of touhou characters so I'll see where that goes  




 Me: hey did you litter!?! 

Other person: no......

Me: !! 




 Having links to seamlessR's channel would be a start, some links to forums and good free sample packs, create a /r/edmproduction essential pack with samples and patches for well known synths like harmor, sylenth1, serum and massive (probably missing afew) and linking to really well known tutorials for things like side chaining and stuff along those lines  and putting all of those in a beginner tab would really help out a lot of new producers. Having genre specific sections would also be great i.e. hard dance most popular plug-ins, kick tutorials, lead tutorials, sample packs things like that 




 Here are some previews if you want to listen before you download!

 Japanese hardstyle 3 









 I feel bad for anyone who's stand is a trash can  




 I would stick them all over my binder and in random places at my school 




 The Japanese scene is filled with many fantastic hardcore producers but sadly not a lot of hardstyle ones :( it's cool to see QUIL branching out and trying his hand at hardstyle.

[Preview](https://clyp.it/aoz1n24g) 









 DJ Shimura, Kobaryo, moro, DJ Noriken, DJ Sharpnel, Kenta-v. ez. QUIL, M1dy, M-Project, you, RoughSketch, NNN and t+pazolite  




 No....... We can go farther, the abyss thinks it can scare us off but little dose it know we're going in dry 




 Really digging the drips, mad max was a good movie wasn't it? ;) 




 please dont let it happen :( Aphex twin, Vsnares, square pusher, all other IDM gods.......... hear our prayer  




 Loco is one of my faves  




 Dillion Francis is now Satan and DJ Hanzel is now God 




 Hey guys! When I get into a new genre I like to go all out and buying a ton of tracks, are their any massive compilations out there or will I just have to buy a ton of EPs? Ok now for the second part of the title, I just haven't been listening to a lot of Hardstyle lately, I don't know why because I still love it, I guess I just got kinda bored :/, but know I want to get back into it, are their any recent releases I should check out?  




 Looks pretty cool doesn't it?  




 You can buy them!! They are expensive though (40$)  




 The actual design isn't mine but the shirt is (kinda) check out Yo Shirt (iPhone only) you can take any picture and turn it into a screen print shirt 




 *inhales through teeth* ya.... 









 Man DJing at hardstyle events must do wonders for your legs and arms, also I really like that vocal sound at 1:21, DJ mad dog used it in a real voice 









 Hey guys! I don't know how AMA's are organized on here but I do have afew sugestions: Headhunterz, he made the switch from hardstyle to house a bit ago so I think people would have some questions for him. Angerfist, he had his own festival last year and he released a pretty kick ass album to go along with it. Noisecontrollers, one of the biggest names in the hardstyle scene, he has an album coming out soon and I think it would be cool to ask him afew questions  









 Get this track and many others on the #TIH soundcloud for free! Support what these guys are doing and enjoy  









 I think we're not kind enough actually, your videos are fantastic! We need more SFM guys doing SBFP stuff 




 [Waifu time](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1585774?tags=monster_girl_encyclopedia) she's riped and super snuggle-able, enjoy 




 Taking moe blobness to the next level 




 Fear not friend I shall find you a waifu! She will keep you safe from the creepiness of the Internet! Now let's  see here...... Maybe ummm, no no that will never do....... Ah! Wait no no no............. Yes perfect! [Do you like dragons?](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1681598?tags=ryuu_%28monster_girl_encyclopedia%29) also sweater bonus :3  




 Do u liek the boobs tho :3? 




 dudeeeeeee!!!! we need boobs, boobs to clean our mind [do you like cow girls?](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1895147?tags=holstaurus0) SFW I promise I don't want to scar your mind anymore! 




 thank you robit 




 Jesus Christ dude.......... forget NSFW that shit is NSFL! For those wondering Hyper realistic creepy spider chick sucking a dudes dick, its real life and its fucking gross keep that link blue guys  




 [Snake girls FTW](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1962836?tags=monster_girl_encyclopedia) I love all monster girls except bug girls...... I don't want a centipede going to town on my dick 




 Being super serious here, how dose one get into ecchi harem stuff? I've tried watching/reading a few and I always get turned off by the writing and "hilarious moments" (two characters are about to do it and someone walks in) also I'm the kind of person who gets embarrassed watching embarrassing things, is their no hope for me? I want to give this one a fair chance since a lot of people like it     




 For the hard dance boys and girls!

This is terror 14 (if you like terrorcore)

Universal tranzmission (a compilation from kidd kaoses label, some great hard trance 3)

Angerfist - Retaliate (hardcore classic)

D-block and S-te-fan - Super nova (2009-2010 Hardstyle 3)

Darren Styles   Francis Hill - Come Running (rounding it off with some UK hardcore)









 




 People like us OP, People like us........ (I'm into monster girls) at least we can find comfort in the fact that we're not into guro loli vomit rape  




 I've been playing for a few hours and for someone who doesn't play 1v1 fighters a lot I have to say its well animated and a lot of fun 









 Quick question! how do I make the game english? 




 Fuck looks like I have to cancel. Sorry guys :/

Edit: looks like I'm back in :D 









 Playing songs you have never heard! I love doing that, I love the music I listen to and if I can make atleast one person in the crowd love it as well then I will be happy   




 Fuck! I linked to the reddit post not the video _ oh well.... If any of you guys want some cool white noise go right ahead and sample this vid! 









 This is really good! I hope I can win DJ comps when I go to collage. Where do you go to school? My musical taste is exactly like yours. Also can you give a track list for us mobile scrubs? ;_; 









 I'm super jealous of everyone who gets to go! The QULT line up looks amazing with people like Yoji, ASYS, Geck-o and Issac on the hard trance stage they got people like Kidd Kaos and Dark By Design and on the Kiddfectious stage they got Tone (if you don't know who tone is, he did a song with kidd kaos (his only song) called closer and it's fantastic) 




 Lucky... Where I'm from no one knows what any of those things are :( 









 Really? 




 Join the QULT! 




 This isn't the YouTube comments section M8  




 Holy shit!....... H....h....hi ke^y^^o^^^r^^^^i 




 This guy is basically a blond version of Pat 









 My coward can't possibly be this handsome! 




 Lny Tnz dose trapstlye pretty regularly and TTU by Flosstradamus had a Hardstyle ending. I think audiofeq has afew trapstlye songs but I might be wrong  




 You are doing gods work friend! Now all I need are clips of pat talking about crack and the "project" can officially begin :) 




 welp, I haven't beat any of the games but lets give this a shot! 




 fantastic for rainy days with cups of coffee and assorted sweets  









 I'm getting a 403 error on the Alice pic for some reason :/, I'm on mobile so that might be it 









 I saw a thread on the escapist awhile back and this is bringing all those memories back  




 I'm the exact opposite, I've only played two of the games but I'm really into arangements (if arrangements were a girl I would be balls deep in that shit) also I will not fite you over your waifu, because I too am a bleeder 
  




 music threads are a great way for a community to learn more about eachother and what better way then talking about music from a game where lolis in rediculious getup's shoot absurd amounts of bullets at eachother! (you have to admit that sounds pretty hype and we're all about hype here ;) ) Ok so here's how this will work 3 of your favorite types of arrangements (because choosing is hard) 2 of your favorite songs and let's say 5 of your favorite arrangements (for bonus points post your Touhou waifu and be juged by the scrublord army). I'll start (it doesn't just have to be electronic, want to post your favorite Celtic folk arrangement? go for it man!)   

Arrangement type: Schranz/Hardcore/Hardstyle

Songs: Reach for the moon imortal smoke and U.N. Owen was her?

Fave arrangements: [Reach The Speed by Round Wave Crusher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7UVCxcW46Y), [Bad Apple by Shingo Dj](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU5SQAOdvIU), [Rabies by moro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqOiGJA1nSM), [Trick Gang by Thanatos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFEspH5qt94), and finally [Vampire Majesty by pocotan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEhqj6b1DPQ)

Waifu: [Momiji](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1871941?tags=arinu) awoooo~ 3 

  




 [Buy this for your mom so she knows how perfect you are](http://m.imgur.com/js4nl3a) 




 this goes out to all the moms who over hear all the stupid shit the ziabatzu say over washing their mcgrittles, but seriously take a little time out of your day and let your mom know how much she means to you  




 Good ol renard, I've never really been able to get into his music for some reason, even with genres that I enjoy, like speedcore and happy hardcore. I will say that his song big black as QBF is amazing though  




 Oh how the mighty have fallen!! (not far mind you, he was already close to the bottom of the abyss)  




 Some of the pics aren't straight because I did these on my phone 









 Download the app and [save the pic](http://m.imgur.com/js4nl3a) go to import photo and choose the pic. This is a app for making custom shirts so this is the only way, sorry :( 




 [My perfect design with extra ginger](http://imgur.com/7j7oCV0) 




 What is this!? 2003?! fuck man..... ;_; 









 In all seriousness the app is actually really cool and you can make some really sick shirts  




 Re-submitted because the original title sounded super shilly  














 I am at a loss for words.......... What more is their to be said about this? Seriously the term "stillborn birth" is mentioned  




 If were going to hell [I'm making sure your going deeper then me mike!!!!](http://www.cringechannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/video-hip-hop-sonic.jpg) 




 How pretentious can you be? 




 Are you the guy who made the pryda snare? XDxxxxxddDxD 




 Heck ya! Be sure to check out the song greyscale, it was a song he made it 2007 that didn't make the album  




 I think I know what song your talking about, it was the "ooooh spooky" sample at the end of spoken wasn't it 




 Purgatory! That place is sick, not only is their good music but theirs also asari strippers (   ) 




 For the uninitiated, over here in the twin cities James is known as a guru when it comes to everything electronic. If your part of the dance music seen here then you know him and have learned somthing from him   




 Man, I wish him and Zatox would make more wild motherfuckerz tracks.... It's been to long 









 checkout his album as Meander, its called Gazing long into the abyss. Crossbreed at its finest 
 




 Now all we need are QULT shirts and stickers, I would rock the shit out of a shirt and I would buy 20 stickers and put them in random places
