 You obviously have 0 empathy. 




 Just gonna chime in here about something that may seem minor to you but I'm pretty sure a psychotic episode lasts for a lot longer than a day. 




 The side effects of the drugs don't seem worth it anymore. I was such a zombie that didn't care if he lived or died. Someone could've came in my house and robbed me and I would've just sat there and watched. I'll obviously continue medication if I ever get symptoms again but for the time being, I feel much better without the meds. I've always thought that the medication should only be used short term for when psychosis props up (obviously some people need them all the time, but a lot of us dont). 




 Kurt is still really relevant today, especially amount teenagers and young adults. He died in his prime, he'll never fade away. 




 Isn't natural happiness just serotonin, dopamine, endorphins etc. getting released too, just in smaller amounts? 




 Maybe the kid ate it super fast. 




 Favourite part about this gif is how it looks like the cat laughs at the end. 




 It's the whole reason people have to go to therapy. 




  kids fucking these days

FTFY 




 Doctor Insano can check it out. 




 What medication are you on? If it's antipsychotics then 9/10 of them make you sedated. 




 He'll be in bed all day instead of out of bed. 




 I've really not got around to trying it yet. I really have no clue how I'd go about getting CBD only strains if weed is still illegal in the UK, unless CBD is legal in the UK? I'm not completely sure, I should look into it a little bit more. And yes, I have schizophrenia and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the cognitive decline and negative symptoms are by far the most disabling.  




 There obviously isn't much studies around it just yet but there has been a bunch of personal exp that I've heard over at /r/schizophrenia that say that it helps with negative symptoms (the most damaging symptoms of schizophrenia). Antipsychotics right now, don't help at all with the negative symptoms and if they do its very, very minimal. So if CBD is an antipsychotic that can help negative symptoms then it would be an insane breakthrough for people like me. 




 CBD is actually a pretty good antipsychotic (even for negative symptoms, some people have tried it)... Probably way better than the antipsychotics we have to use right now.  




 That interviewer was really anxious when I seen that interview. f0rest definitely banged that though. 




 Advice from a non-schizophrenic is always welcome mainly because it helps me understand people that are "normal" a little bit better, and gives me a completely new perspective and ways of thinking about things I guess you could say, just like if I told a non-schizophrenic about my perspective then it could also change theirs (if that made any sense at all). 

I wouldn't say she reacted negatively but she reacted in a weird way, maybe passive-aggressive? I'm not sure. I think she likes but also hates that I can't empathize as well as others. I CAN empathize it's just weakened most of the time unless I've built a strong strong relationship with you which usually takes so long that people give up.

It's never really caused a full blown argument with anyone, they usually just stop speaking to me for a while (or I somehow stop speaking to them). 




 I've taken stupid amounts of tramadol (don't take over 400mg like I did, it was stupid) and I nodded so hard that I was talking to my girlfriend on facetime and I kept nodding out and thinking I was still talking to her, shit was crazy and that went on for a good 12 hours. 




 Benzo AND alcohol withdrawal is definitely worse than opiate withdrawal but opiate withdrawal definitely fucks with you mentally (not nearly as much as benzos but still bad). 









 I'd like to think I could. 




 Consult Dr. Insano. 




 He seems like a sociopathic, narcissistic retard if I'm going to be blunt... I don't think your sister even likes him either, she's just super afraid of being alone (which I can get 100%)... I would get her therapy because her self confidence is super super low, and tell her current boyfriend to get to fuck. 




 Okay, okay, so I know that I will never be cured of schizophrenia and I will most likely have a psychotic episode some time since I'm off of my medication but how long can it take for the psychotic symptoms to come back? I've been off of my medication and I don't feel too bad at all. Usually I would rapid relapse and become psychotic in under a month, but this time seems different. My psychiatrist is always fucking off, I'm seeing my psychologist though but I don't think they know too much about schizophrenia and the medicine. Also, the reason I came off of Seroquel is because it made my functioning a lot worse. 




 I developed it in my mid teens (I'm not all that old so I've not lived with it for as long as some people like Joseph). Started off with following commands that I heard and feeling paranoid about nearly everyone and everything, and of course, being extremely isolated. 




 I read somewhere that a good portion of the population have audio hallucinations and the like but don't have schizophrenia (they usually hear their name in the wind or some shit like that), that's probably what he means. 




 I'd just wait around for the food then leave. 




 Lately I've noticed that some of my ADHD symptoms have been coming back (I was predominantly inattentive), so I've been thinking about going back to my psychiatrist and asking if I can go back on medication for that also but the only problem is that the stimulant medication was the only meds that worked for me and as you know, stimulants can cause psychosis. Could I technically try the stimulants out again to see if they might work without causes psychosis or am I just putting my health at even more risk? I don't even know if she'll prescribe because of the schizophrenia, but it's causing problems with keeping attention on school stuff that I have to get back into.

Has anyone ever had experience with being on ADHD (stimulant) medication and having a mental illness like schizophrenia, or even bipolar? 




 Are you dumb?  




 Pretty sure seroquel blocks serotonin at doses 100mg+, that's probably why he thought it would help. 




 Yeah, I'm 100% sure sadly. 




 I've been looking everywhere to see if any doctors or scientists agree that nausea is a form of pain but I can't find anything (especially chronic nausea, like in my case)... I suffer from a mystery stomach condition that makes me nauseas and vomit every day. The nausea is so severe that I'd probably rather be shot in the knee. Basically what I'm asking is, why isn't nausea considered a form of pain when in my experience it's a form of pain? 




 Euphoria with stimulants, psychedelics and opiates are so vastly different. You obviously like euphoria from stims and stuff more than downers... Different strokes. 




 The comedown when I was on MPH therapeutically was pretty much just passing out and a headache as far as I can remember but recreationally the come down for MPH is horrendous IME... Thank god my ADHD has pretty much subsided. 




 I didn't eat at all when I was on them. I would have to come off them at the weekends to actually eat. I went from being happy and emotional to as apathetic as a sociopath. Definitely wasn't a nice experience, and the anxiety was pretty much the worst. I would sweat so badly I could probably give everyone that encountered me a glass of water. 




 Eh, some people like the methylphenidates over amphetamines... Amphetamines also aren't that recreational at usual doses. I'm talking about how recreational would it be at a therapeutic dosage? 




 I'm not really sure right now. My symptoms are pretty broad. Gastro disease symptoms are usually pretty broad, as in, symptoms of one thing is also symptoms of another thing. 




 Were they mushrooms? 




 Self-medicating will probably make his life go down the shitter. RC's are a shady area because you could be doing well with a good RC and then "BOOM" it's made illegal.  




 My only problem with this is, isn't ethylphenidate a little more recreational than normal ritalin? 




 I have schizophrenia and don't medicate anymore (around 2 months off). Medication wont prevent you from making your life go to the "metaphorical" shitter, it'll just be a helpful tool. Being off of medication also wont make your life go down the shitter either, I'm willing to bet you'll make it through, yes you life may be different in 6 months but that doesn't mean that it'll be worse. I had ADHD as well when I was a kid and a teenager, and was on ritalin most of my life and if I'm going to be honest, it sucked. The medication probably MADE my life go down the "shitter". As /u/jepyang said, people make it through this shit all the time and people make it through worse stuff as well, you'll get there, just go through the proper channels whenever you can. 




 Some people don't like opiates, simple as that. Even though they're the most addictive class of drugs on planet earth, not everyone likes them. Opiate nausea is pretty common before a tolerance builds, then once you've used for a while it kinda comes back (for me anyway, but I have an unknown stomach condition). The euphoria from opiates is different from other drugs, it's a warm, fuzzy feeling and a feeling that everything is just, fine (especially when nodding out). As I said though, not everyone likes them, there's been countless people on opioid painkillers before and never, ever got addicted (or even felt a buzz or liked the buzz) and then there's people out there that gets addicted to them and loves the high.

Maybe you're someone that just doesn't like opiates... Just because they're extremely addictive doesn't mean that everyone loves the feeling, consider it a blessing. 




 Oh, I thought you meant A E... I'll look into it, but can they do expensive tests like a gastro doctor would be able to do in a hospital? That's the problem, I pretty much need these tests to get treatment. 




 Thank you, sir. 




 Yep, the heroin problem is about the same if not worse... I can go to the shop (about 2-5 mins walking distance) and see around 2-3 heroin addicts every time and those are just the ones that are really bad because they've been addicts for decades. Pills on the other hand are probably slightly bigger but definitely nothing like the US, I can find some oxy here and there but mainly the pills consist of prescription stimulants (mainly ritalin), benzodiazepines (namely, valium and temazepam)... Prescription opiates aren't all that big on the streets, because after all, why do we need prescription opiates if we have a shit ton of heroin? 




 In the US you would either get life or 10 or so years. 




 He's a badass... 




 UK. Yep, we do, but I always feel like I'd just waste their time, since I'm not acutely dying. 




 ... What? 




 I'm really pissed off mainly because I have to wait probably months to see my stomach doctor again, even though he fucking canceled on me. Anyway, I have an unknown stomach condition as of now because these doctors are so fucking slow, I went from just having diarrhea around 8x a day to having, chronic nausea, bright red blood in my shit, chronic heart burn, feeling full after eating practically nothing, indigestion, stomach pain, burping all the time etc. The nausea itself can be extremely debilitating, and because my GP said that I just had "IBS" a couple of months ago (before all these other symptoms started) I have some person from my college saying that I can't be having all these symptoms that bad, I don't even want to go back to my GP because they're fucking morons, I have to wait for my gastroenterologist which will most likely take months again or go up to the hospital. I wouldn't be surprised if I was fucking dead by the time I go to see them. 




 APAP can be harsh on some peoples stomachs (not just your liver) and can make some people nauseas even at low doses. Also hydro is a little more nausea inducing than other opiates, like I said, like codeine and morphine... Can you get promethazine OTC in the US? If not, try like 25-50mg Benadryl that can sometimes take the nausea away (and also the itchiness).  




 Does it have APAP combined with them? If so, then that could be the reason. Also, hydrocodone causes nausea a little more than other opiates, same with codeine and morphine. 




 I'm willing to bet that you don't really know what the high is like, therefore you don't know what you're looking for. Some people don't even know they're getting high on opiates until they do it a few times. 




 Go to Russia, right now. 




 Reading that just gave me heart burn. 




 Than dying of liver failure? I'd rather withdrawal than die, yikes. 




 Oh, thanks for the info... That'll be pretty nice to see. 




 Are they not banning the analogues of methylphenidate all together for 12 months as well? 




 Dihydroetorphine is technically stronger, depending on ROA. 




 Most people do, and yes it is stupid but whatever. Not our lives. This is just /r/rant, for you know, ranting. 




 Calm down. 




 Have fun... You'll be completely fine, just don't over do it. 




 Where's my opiate station? 




 Maybe, just maybe, he wants to do heroin and amphetamine instead. 




 If God was real then why would he inflict this terrible disease on to anyone?  




 Body weight doesn't come into dosing with opiates, I believe. 




 Yeah, show me this acid bath. 




 I'm pretty sure amphetamine causes you do analyze things a little more deeply but also quicker, so that's probably why it's good for things like Chess or games like CS or CoD because you can make "better" decisions faster. 




 Another reason why drugs should be legalized. Rest in Peace bropiates. 




 It depends on where you look but they are fentanyl analogues. For example, carfentanil which is tens of thousands more potent than morphine while heroin is only around 5x more potent, but that's pretty much unusable without overdosing. Fentanyl is also stronger than heroin and is around 100x(ish) more potent than morphine. Ohmefentanyl is also a lot stronger at around 6000x (can reach up to 18000x) more potent than morphine. 3-methylfentanyl is also a lot more potent. But if I was to say what was the most potent I would go with either carfentanil, dihydroetorphine or maybe even ohmefentanyl but these opioids cannot be used in humans because they are that potent, for example, carfentanil is active at around 1ug.

Btw, the way you measure opiate potency is by looking at how more potent it is than morphine. 




 Always tastes like vinegar for me though. 




 For sure. Heroin is definitely not even close to the strongest. 




 Sneezing happens occasionally but because it depends on the person it's not a solid symptom. 




 Opiate withdrawal will make you feel lethargic/tired but you won't be able to sleep (or if you can, it'll be minimal and low quality). You should expect mild normal opiate withdrawal (since you're tapering) but you should also expect SNRI-like withdrawal because of the tramadol, most common of these symptoms is brain zapping. Also, ask your doctor (if you can) about clonidine, that can be helpful when you're having uncomfortable symptoms, good luck.

[These are the most common symptoms.](http://gyazo.com/700b56e973c8de8040a190465a6df9db) 




 Or, "I got morphine once in the hospital so I took like 1 - 2 grams of heroin and was totally fine". 




 Yeah, I smoked weed my whole life and shit and I took like 2 grams of dope and was totally coherent and no one suspected a thing, was only a mild high though. /s 




 I've had dreams that I done crack and I've never done crack in my life. Every time I took a hit everything would go quiet then everything would pretty much just zap right back in, if that makes sense? Then I would run down to somewhere and look into these mirrors and my pupils would be so big they were coming out of my eyes and shit... Really weird.  




 Everyone reacts differently to opiates. If you also felt like you couldn't breathe properly then that could've been a major factor. 




 Yeah I know that fentanyl is extremely potent, that's why I never touched it. I'm doing some pharmacology but the chemistry is definitely something I struggle with, thank you anyway. 




 You're probably panicking because it's an unfamiliar feeling. 




 Thanks for answering my question. What's the reason why opiates like morphine are harder to make than things like fentanyl? (I know this might seem like a stupid question). 




 Question to chemists: How easy would it be to synthesize things like morphine, fentanyl etc? 




 What? DXM and Ketamine may both be dissociatives but they're not similar chemically (at least I don't think). 




 Damn, Kris is a shortened version of my name. 




 I'm usually better at social interaction over the internet or through text as well, but if I know a person irl and I'm speaking to them over text and they start getting emotional, I still don't know how to deal with that or show that I care. Sometimes, I simply don't FEEL like I care but I know in my own thoughts that I care, if that makes any sense? My social interactions no matter what are never really smooth mainly because the things I say don't make sense a lot of the time (especially in person but even through text my words will sometimes still get jumbled and I'll still be at a lose of words 90% of the time).

I've always been kinda cold, distant and detached even before my first psychotic break. 




 You can delete it yourself. 




 I always thought heroin had some sort of glamour to it, more than coke to be honest. 




 God damn it, now I want to ask. 




 David Nutt ma main man. 




 Scotland is more progressive than England and pretty much always has been. 




 [You're goddamn right.](http://weknowgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/youre-goddamn-right-gif.gif) 




 I tend to not agree with a lot of the things on bluelight. 




 Yeah, why not? They look kinda cool. 




 You're most likely right, I am in a state of blunted emotions right now. That's probably why, but it just seems like I can never get out of it and that I'll never be able to empathize with someone again. 

Thanks for the advice. 




 Just another post by me, basically writing to myself but also to the sub reddit, like usual. Anyway, I've recently been speaking to someone I was very close to and she's started opening up to me and stuff but the thing is, I have 0 idea how to react to the stuff she says. Like, she'll tell me something really emotional and I'll seem cold and distant, maybe I am cold and distant but I want to try and seem like I'm not, if that makes any sense? It's like when she tells me something really emotional I just won't know how to react to it, hell, I don't even know how to react to stuff that isn't deep and emotional, I just usually send funny pictures to people and joke around that's pretty much the extent of my social skills. I really want to change that but I don't know how. 

Does anyone else have experience with this? I know a lot of you probably don't have a lot of social contact (like me, except two people I know in real life and 2-3 people over the internet), but maybe some of you can either relate or help me? Thank you.

Also, this is a progression (or what feels like a progression). As in, it's been getting worse and worse for about a year. 




 I'm not sure. I kinda knew about them for a long time then I finally started to actually listen to them and now I've been pretty much addicted ever since. 




 I'm not saying this to make anyone feel special. We're people with an illness, we shouldn't define ourselves because of schizophrenia and think we're special for it. This is just purely information on something. 




 People panic over apap all the time. If someone takes 4g they automatically think that their liver is turning into a hash brown.  




 He just wants to expand his mond.

Edit: grammar, after reading his comment my English got fucked up for a sec. 




 I've been doing some reading about why schizophrenia is so prevalent in modern society even though it seems useless and I've came across a few articles that suggest that schizophrenia may actually be favoured on an evolutionary basis for some odd reason. Some articles suggested that maybe its been favoured because maybe schizophrenics were/are the ones that draw and separate people from the herd (crowd) and allow humans to be more diverse in their thinking, rather than just mindlessly following everyone else. It seems like a good explanation why schizophrenia is so prevalent even though it has great social and human cost. 

I hope this doesn't sound either too confusing or insanely stupid, but what do you think about this? I can link the articles if people ask. 




 Alcoholics are usually extremely malnourished.  




 Like others have said, you can't force anything. You'll have to wait until he's ready, I've lived with two alcoholic parents and I know all too well that forcing someone into treatment is just a disaster waiting to happen, they won't only resent you but they'll relapse over and over and over. My dad has been in and out of treatment for alcoholism for a little over ten years and the longest he's been sober is around a year, now there's not much hope for him. Just be there when he's ready to get help, don't shun him and don't ever turn him away, once he goes through withdrawal (cold turkey, which isn't sustainable btw, users always go back either before the WD is fully complete or after, they need a maintenance) a few times he'll wonder what he's doing and then he'll truly want help.

Also, you can also try /r/Opiates (even though it's full of addicts posting pics, they can be helpful) and /r/OpiatesRecovery

Good luck! 




 Whenever I see someone that wears glasses I automatically think they're rapists and I get super triggered.
