This is not a fight that should be taken lightly.

 I love that Glacier national parks are working to help photographers in this way. If it goes well, it would be great to see it expanded to many more.

 While a perspective from the other side, it's good to understand what those hiring freelancers want and expect. 



















  Lake Mead National Recreation Area remains the sixth most popular destination of the nation's 407 national parks. With 7 million annual visitors, it draws more than the Grand Canyon, Yosemite or Yellowstone...

 Park managers are even contemplating the once-unthinkable: the 950-foot water mark, now just 125 feet away. "We originally discussed 1,000 feet and then dropped to 950," Vanover said. "When we did that there was a moment of silence, like, 'Could we ever reach that level?'"

 OK, I'm not sure if this will work for new members, but since it's a pretty big one, It's probably worth a try. Panera Bread members have received notice that they get a free cup of ice or hot coffee each day for the month of July. Not sure if those who sign up now will also get it, but it might be worth a try: sign up for their rewards program [here](https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/home.html)
