 

**Nuclear deal**



Iran has agreed to reduce by approximately two-thirds its installed centrifuges. Iran will go from having about 19,000 installed today to 6,104 installed under the deal, with only 5,060 of these enriching uranium for 10 years. 

-

Iran will have 6,104 centrifuges installed, not 500 to 1,500 as Washington originally wanted as a ceiling or 4,000 as floated by U.S. officials as a possible compromise. 5,000-6,000 centrifuges is enough for a bomb but not sufficient to power a reactor.

Read [The odd reality of Iran's centrifuges: Enough for a bomb, not power](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/25/michael-morell/odd-reality-irans-centrifuges-enough-bomb-not-powe/)

"A ten-fold increase in Irans centrifuge capacity would be required to enrich enough uranium fuel for its Bushehr reactor alone. And no matter how many more centrifuges Iran installs, it can never become self-sufficient because it does not possess adequate uranium ore reserves for a large-scale nuclear energy program."



All excess centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure will be placed in IAEA monitored storage and will be used only as replacements for operating centrifuges and equipment.

-

Iran can keep the remaining 12,896 centrifuges 

-

Irans breakout timeline  the time that it would take for Iran to acquire enough fissile material for one weapon  is currently assessed to be 2 to 3 months. That timeline will be extended to at least one year, for a duration of at least ten years, under this framework.

-

Obama's bare minimum would have extended nuclear breakout to at least 10 years, they settled for the one year nuclear breakout.

Looks to me like a horrible deal.

 [Here is most probably why](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/317ven/iran_nuclear_deal_reached_after_eight_straight/cpzg8hs) 




 **ELI5** Is it a deal or not?

details are still subject to negotiation, **and nothing is agreed until everything is agreed** 




 Read [The odd reality of Iran's centrifuges: Enough for a bomb, not power](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/25/michael-morell/odd-reality-irans-centrifuges-enough-bomb-not-powe/)


Morell told PunditFact he said 5,000 because that was lowest number he had heard was in play. The number of centrifuges in place today is a hair over 20,000, and a likely goal is to cut that to about 5,000. But Morells basic point struck us as just plain intriguing. We wanted to learn more about this idea that a nuclear power program would require many more centrifuges than youd need for a bomb -- which by extension means that limiting centrifuge capacity is just one negotiating point out of many.

-

Bottom line: Making bombs takes fewer centrifuges. And without a lot of centrifuges, its hard to make nuclear power. For the record, some centrifuge models are better than others, so that's also a factor.

Today, Iran has just one nuclear power station, the plant at Bushehr that it bought from the Russians. To keep that facility running, Iran would need to increase its centrifuge capacity ten-fold. A steady supply of fuel from Russia is what keeps Bushehr online. 




 How could it have improved?  I feel like the only things that would satisfy some people..

A nuclear deal as originally floated by Obama and Washington. Read what you just commented on. 




 Correct. They are most likely 

a bunch on Iranian expats in Denmark having a drink.

But she tweeted that they were from Tehran.

This was her first tweet

https://twitter.com/MishaZand/status/583697346837483520

followed by a response to her own tweet

https://twitter.com/MishaZand/status/583719052679507968

At the very least she is intentionally deceiving..  




 I knew that, but you get arrested for drinking in public (and private too). I think it's propaganda.

Edit: She tweeted that it was from Tehran. See thread.

Edit: added detail law is not limited to public drinking.

##### Parameters for a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action regarding the Islamic Republic of Irans  Nuclear Program
     

Washington

###Below are the key parameters of a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) regarding the Islamic Republic of Irans nuclear program that were decided in Lausanne, Switzerland. These elements form the foundation upon which the final text of the JCPOA will be written between now and June 30, and reflect the significant progress that has been made in discussions between the P5+1, the European Union, and Iran. Important implementation details are still subject to negotiation, and nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. We will work to conclude the JCPOA based on these parameters over the coming months.

 ---

**Enrichment**



 Iran has agreed to reduce by approximately two-thirds its installed centrifuges. Iran will
go from having about 19,000 installed today to 6,104 installed under the deal, with only
5,060 of these enriching uranium for 10 years. All 6,104 centrifuges will be IR-1s, Irans
first-generation centrifuge.

 Iran has agreed to not enrich uranium over 3.67 percent for at least 15 years.

 Iran has agreed to reduce its current stockpile of about 10,000 kg of low-enriched uranium (LEU) to 300 kg of 3.67 percent LEU for 15 years.

 All excess centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure will be placed in IAEA monitored
storage and will be used only as replacements for operating centrifuges and equipment.

 Iran has agreed to not build any new facilities for the purpose of enriching uranium for 15 years.

 Irans breakout timeline  the time that it would take for Iran to acquire enough fissile
material for one weapon  is currently assessed to be 2 to 3 months. That timeline will be
extended to at least one year, for a duration of at least ten years, under this framework.

 ---
**Iran will convert its facility at Fordow so that it is no longer used to enrich uranium**



 Iran has agreed to not enrich uranium at its Fordow facility for at least 15 years.

 Iran has agreed to convert its Fordow facility so that it is used for peaceful purposes only
 into a nuclear, physics, technology, research center.

 Iran has agreed to not conduct research and development associated with uranium
enrichment at Fordow for 15 years.

 Iran will not have any fissile material at Fordow for 15 years. 
2

 Almost two-thirds of Fordows centrifuges and infrastructure will be removed. The
remaining centrifuges will not enrich uranium. All centrifuges and related infrastructure
will be placed under IAEA monitoring.

 ---

**Iran will only enrich uranium at the Natanz facility, with only 5,060 IR-1 first-generation centrifuges for ten years.**

 Iran has agreed to only enrich uranium using its first generation (IR-1 models)
centrifuges at Natanz for ten years, removing its more advanced centrifuges.

 Iran will remove the 1,000 IR-2M centrifuges currently installed at Natanz and place
them in IAEA monitored storage for ten years.

 Iran will not use its IR-2, IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, or IR-8 models to produce enriched uranium
for at least ten years. Iran will engage in limited research and development with its
advanced centrifuges, according to a schedule and parameters which have been agreed to
by the P5+1.

 For ten years, enrichment and enrichment research and development will be limited to
ensure a breakout timeline of at least 1 year. Beyond 10 years, Iran will abide by its
enrichment and enrichment R D plan submitted to the IAEA, and pursuant to the
JCPOA, under the Additional Protocol resulting in certain limitations on enrichment
capacity.

 ---

**Inspections and Transparency**

 The IAEA will have regular access to all of Irans nuclear facilities, including to Irans
enrichment facility at Natanz and its former enrichment facility at Fordow, and including
the use of the most up-to-date, modern monitoring technologies.

 Inspectors will have access to the supply chain that supports Irans nuclear program. The
new transparency and inspections mechanisms will closely monitor materials and/or
components to prevent diversion to a secret program.

 Inspectors will have access to uranium mines and continuous surveillance at uranium
mills, where Iran produces yellowcake, for 25 years.

 Inspectors will have continuous surveillance of Irans centrifuge rotors and bellows
production and storage facilities for 20 years. Irans centrifuge manufacturing base will
be frozen and under continuous surveillance.

 All centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure removed from Fordow and Natanz will be
placed under continuous monitoring by the IAEA.

 A dedicated procurement channel for Irans nuclear program will be established to
monitor and approve, on a case by case basis, the supply, sale, or transfer to Iran of 
3
certain nuclear-related and dual use materials and technology  an additional
transparency measure.

 Iran has agreed to implement the Additional Protocol of the IAEA, providing the IAEA
much greater access and information regarding Irans nuclear program, including both
declared and undeclared facilities.

 Iran will be required to grant access to the IAEA to investigate suspicious sites or
allegations of a covert enrichment facility, conversion facility, centrifuge production
facility, or yellowcake production facility anywhere in the country.

 Iran has agreed to implement Modified Code 3.1 requiring early notification of
construction of new facilities.

 Iran will implement an agreed set of measures to address the IAEAs concerns regarding
the Possible Military Dimensions (PMD) of its program.

 ---

**Reactors and Reprocessing**

 Iran has agreed to redesign and rebuild a heavy water research reactor in Arak, based on a
design that is agreed to by the P5+1, which will not produce weapons grade plutonium,
and which will support peaceful nuclear research and radioisotope production.

 The original core of the reactor, which would have enabled the production of significant
quantities of weapons-grade plutonium, will be destroyed or removed from the country.

 Iran will ship all of its spent fuel from the reactor out of the country for the reactors
lifetime.

 Iran has committed indefinitely to not conduct reprocessing or reprocessing research and
development on spent nuclear fuel.

 Iran will not accumulate heavy water in excess of the needs of the modified Arak reactor,
and will sell any remaining heavy water on the international market for 15 years.

 Iran will not build any additional heavy water reactors for 15 years.

 ---

**Sanctions**

 Iran will receive sanctions relief, if it verifiably abides by its commitments.

 U.S. and E.U. nuclear-related sanctions will be suspended after the IAEA has verified
that Iran has taken all of its key nuclear-related steps. If at any time Iran fails to fulfill its
commitments, these sanctions will snap back into place. 
4

 The architecture of U.S. nuclear-related sanctions on Iran will be retained for much of
the duration of the deal and allow for snap-back of sanctions in the event of significant
non-performance.

 All past UN Security Council resolutions on the Iran nuclear issue will be lifted
simultaneous with the completion, by Iran, of nuclear-related actions addressing all key
concerns (enrichment, Fordow, Arak, PMD, and transparency).

 However, core provisions in the UN Security Council resolutions  those that deal with
transfers of sensitive technologies and activities  will be re-established by a new UN
Security Council resolution that will endorse the JCPOA and urge its full
implementation. It will also create the procurement channel mentioned above, which will
serve as a key transparency measure. Important restrictions on conventional arms and
ballistic missiles, as well as provisions that allow for related cargo inspections and asset
freezes, will also be incorporated by this new resolution.

 A dispute resolution process will be specified, which enables any JCPOA participant, to
seek to resolve disagreements about the performance of JCPOA commitments.

 If an issue of significant non-performance cannot be resolved through that process, then
all previous UN sanctions could be re-imposed.

 U.S. sanctions on Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles will
remain in place under the deal.

 ---
**Phasing**

 For ten years, Iran will limit domestic enrichment capacity and research and development
 ensuring a breakout timeline of at least one year. Beyond that, Iran will be bound by its
longer-term enrichment and enrichment research and development plan it shared with the
P5+1.

 For fifteen years, Iran will limit additional elements of its program. For instance, Iran will
not build new enrichment facilities or heavy water reactors and will limit its stockpile of
enriched uranium and accept enhanced transparency procedures.

 Important inspections and transparency measures will continue well beyond 15 years.
Irans adherence to the Additional Protocol of the IAEA is permanent, including its
significant access and transparency obligations. The robust inspections of Irans uranium
supply chain will last for 25 years.

 Even after the period of the most stringent limitations on Irans nuclear program, Iran
will remain a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which prohibits Irans
development or acquisition of nuclear weapons and requires IAEA safeguards on its
nuclear program.

**From Johns Hopkins website**


[**Johns Hopkins Media Statement - April 1, 2015-**](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/guatemala_study/)
-

-


Johns Hopkins expresses profound sympathy for individuals and families impacted by the deplorable 1940s syphilis study conducted by the U.S. government in Guatemala. This was not a Johns Hopkins study. Johns Hopkins did not initiate, pay for, direct or conduct the study in Guatemala. No nonprofit university or hospital has ever been held liable for a study conducted by the U.S. government. 



It has been well established by a Presidential Commission that this unconscionable research was funded and executed by the United States government. The President, U.S. Secretary of State and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services have apologized to the Guatemalan government and to all affected.



plaintiffs essential claim in this case is that prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members participation on a government committee that reviewed funding applications was tantamount to conducting the research itself and that therefore Johns Hopkins should be held liable. Neither assertion is true.



A class action lawsuit seeking to hold federal officials responsible for the Guatemala study has been filed and dismissed. U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton dismissed that action in 2012 and stated that the pleas of victims for relief are more appropriately directed to the political branches of the federal government.



For more than half a century since the time of the Guatemala study, scholars, ethicists and clinicians have worked with government officials to establish rigorous ethical standards for human research. Johns Hopkins welcomes bioethical inquiry into the U.S. government's Guatemala study and its legacy. This lawsuit, however, is an attempt by plaintiffs counsel to exploit a historic tragedy for monetary gain. Plaintiffs legal claims are not supported by the facts.


We will vigorously defend the lawsuit.

[**A Letter to the Johns Hopkins Community - April 1, 2015-**](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/guatemala_study/)

**SUBJECT: Challenges from the past**
-

Dear Member of the Johns Hopkins Community,

More than 60 years ago, the U.S. government conducted an unconscionable and unethical experiment in Guatemala, in which U.S. government researchers deliberately infected vulnerable citizens of Guatemala with syphilis and other infectious diseases. We feel profound sympathy for the individuals and families impacted by this deplorable study.

When the details of this study came to light, a Presidential Commission determined that the Guatemala Study was funded and conducted by the United States government. In 2010, the President of the United States, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services apologized to all affected. In 2012, a federal district court concluded that the pleas of victims for relief are more appropriately directed to the political branches of the federal government.

Today, attorneys representing Guatemalan plaintiffs announced that they are suing The Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Health System, alleging that Johns Hopkins was responsible for the study. The plaintiffs essential claim in this case is that prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members participation on a government committee that reviewed funding applications was tantamount to conducting the research itself, and therefore that Johns Hopkins should be held liable. 

Neither assertion is true.

This was not a Johns Hopkins study. Johns Hopkins did not initiate, pay for, direct or conduct the study in Guatemala. Participation in the review of government research was then and is today separate from being a Johns Hopkins employee, and no nonprofit university or hospital has ever been held liable for a study conducted by the U.S. government. 

As a leading global research university, Johns Hopkins values rigorous and open scrutiny of history, even when it is complex and uncomfortable.

We know that historians have previously linked prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members in various ways to other unethical government research studies in Tuskegee and Terre Haute. Although separate from the Guatemala lawsuit, these studies were all deplorable and all demand reflection upon the broader legacy of unethical research. It is important to confront and learn from the past.  At the same time, we cannot let unfounded allegations go unchallenged. We will defend the institution vigorously in court against legal responsibility for the governments Guatemala study.

If you would like more information about the universitys position on the lawsuit, we have released a media statement that you can find here, along with information about the Presidential Commission on the research in Guatemala and its findings.

Sincerely,

While the results of the serological experiments were published in several
different articles,637 and the intentional exposure experiments were referred
to indirectly in later publications,638 the Commission found no evidence
that Dr. Cutlers final reports or the results of the exposure and prophylaxis
experiments were submitted for peer review or published. There are several
published examples in which Dr. Cutler discusses data from these experiments
but misleadingly cites another published study. In these cases, the
published study cited does not actually support the data presented.639 In addition,
the Guatemala experiments are notably absent from historical reviews of
STD research authored by the researchers.640
An enormous amount of money, time, and effort went into the Guatemala
experiments, and the exact motivations for hiding the results is unclear,
particularly because the VDRL researchers published widely on their research
activities, including other STD intentional inoculation

 I tried hitting save but by that time your comment was deleted. Here it is in quoted text 

[u/Horus420I](https://www.reddit.com/user/Horus420I) know nothing about that, care to elaborate?



Most if not all of the remaining Jews' in Yemen are anti-Zionist due to the secular nature of the State of Israel . Their Rabbi has made this clear multiple times and their actions demonstrate his truthfulness. This hasn't helped them one iota and is solid proof that Houthi attacks (or any attack -  AQAP, radical etc.) are of anti-Semitic nature not anti-Zionist. 

In January 2007, Houthi (Ansar-allah) leaders threatened the Jewish families in Saada and Raida (about 400 people at the time), "We warn you to leave the area immediately... We give you a period of 10 days, or you will regret it."

The entire community fled to the capital where the President of Yemen gave the Jews protection in the Jewish quarter in Alafi Qaa, Sanna. 

The Houthis then destroyed their homes, sanctuaries, cars, took their money and property.

They took over Yemen's Jewish library which also holds many antique Jewish manuscripts and a very ancient and rare Torah scroll.

Over time most of Yemen's  remaining 400 Jews  escaped to the United States, Argentina and Israel. As of now there are only about 90 Jews left in the whole Yemen. The remaining 90 did not want to leave. Now even if they change their mind it's too late.


There were multiple incidents of hand-grenade attacks assault. Pelted by rocks, harassment and threatening SMS msgs could be expected as a daily occurrence. (I'm leaving out a few deadly AQAP inspired or radical attacks)

Two months ago two Jewish boys in Sanna were beaten by Houthis and forced to convert to Islam by praying the Shahadah (There is no god but God, Muhammad...) to their prophet Mohammed.



Just last week a few Jewish Yemenite boys tried escaping Yemen through the airport but were turned  back and badly beaten.

This is just a few attacks that I know about. There were many more.

Edit: here's an article from 2007

 On 18 August 2014, the Houthis began a series of demonstrations in Sana'a against increased fuel prices. On 21 September, the Houthis took control of Sana'a, after which Prime Minister Mohammed Basindawa resigned and the Houthis signed a deal for a new unity government with other political parties. The protests were marked by clashes between the Houthis and the government and also clashes between the Houthis and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.[181] At least 340 people were killed on the outskirts of the Yemeni capital in one week of fighting between the Shiite rebels and Sunni militiamen before the city fell.[182] The new government was sworn in on 9 November, although the Houthis and General People's Congress announced they would not take part[183]

-

A spokesman for the Houthi group has accused Yemen's President Hadi of arming members of Al-Qaeda in the Marib province, east of the country, in order to create a new security crisis.[184]

-

The crisis intensified as Houthi militants attacked the presidential palace and private residence in January 2015, quickly seizing control of both. On 22 January, President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi and his ministers resigned.[185] The Houthis declared themselves in full control of the government on 6 February, dissolving parliament and putting a Revolutionary Committee led by Mohammed Ali al-Houthi in charge of the country.[186]

This force could face ISIS with full power and support of Arab countries.

It's more sectarian (anti-Shia) than against terrorism.  This joint military task force was created by Sunni Arabs to defeat Iranian backed Shia Houthi rebels. Many of these countries would never directly attack  Sunni ISIS.
