 Still applies  




 So people know what we are talking about  



















 A simple Atwood's machine is shown in the diagram above. It is composed of a frictionless lightweight pulley with two cubes connected by a light string. If cube A has a mass of 4.0 kg and cube B has a mass of 6.0 kg, the system will move such that cube B accelerates downwards. What would be the tension in the two parts of the string between the pulley and the cubes?

 Racism is racism, we should not tolerate it at any level. If we do we are teaching our kids racism is ok. 









 Regardless it doesn't matter if he was black it didn't add to the story he literally said it for no reason.  




 I've had a black admin in all my schools with less than 25% black population.  




 How many schools have you attended for your assumption that blacks aren't principles?  









 I just asked why mention he's black I did not once mention I was black. I'm saying don't ignore the problem just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  




 Because it doesn't matter 




 If he was white he probably wouldn't have said anything. It's small things that create racism. Sure mentioning he's black was harmless and maybe he was just being descriptive but he probably just mentioned he was black because it's not a generally a black profession and it's isolating blacks as whole. Who cares if he was black or white there was literally no point in saying it. If he cares that much about how it looked he could watch the gif himself. 




 Why did you mention that he was black? EDIT: instead of down voting how about adding to the conversation instead of down voting.  




 My school has a iPhone group chat for every sport except football that I know of 




 They probably can afford to buy them but just so you know I only know about 5-6 people who still actively uses Facebook out of about 100-140
