 If reducing clearance is the goal, then you shouldn't be using single wall pipe.  Double wall stove pipe only requires 6" clearance, allowing you to put the stove as close to the wall as you want without requiring an additional shield.

OP's wall looks great, but most heat shields are a black piece of tin on the wall. Most installations look much nicer without a shield. 




 The woodstove they installed is UL certified with a specific clearance requirement.  As long as the minimum clearance is met, there is no need for an air gap to try and reduce clearance further.  Most modern stoves only have 4"-6" clearance requirements off the back and sides, making additional shields unnecessary. 

Shields are great for uncertified appliances that require 48" clearance to combustibles though. 




 The other one that comes to mind immediately is for the police officer that went unpunished after he killed a kid while driving 120kph in a 50 zone.  But there wasn't a jury in that case, and i believe they're reviewing it, so I guess it doesn't apply. 




 The trial was not about whether or not he killed Jun Lin, but whether or not he had the sense of mind to know what he was doing. Magnotta admitted to killing Jun Lin, but that his state of mind was so psychotic that he didn't know what he was doing was wrong. 

Multiple psychiatrists testified for the defense saying that they felt his schizophrenia was to blame. The obvious planning seemed to prove otherwise for the prosecution. 

I think this is the right decision and I'm very relieved that they jury came to it. Especially after a variety of fucked up decisions by Quebec juries recently.  




 There is case that just closed in Quebec where an officer in an unmarked car was driving 122 kph in a 50 zone.  He killed a 5 year old boy when he struck the car.  Apparently he was not in pursuit of anyone and was on his way to relieve a surveillance team somewhere. There was no rush. He wasn't even sentenced to community hours, just walked away free of charges. 




 Some jobs take more than two weeks to complete, like a bathroom or a kitchen. Not to mention they cost thousands of dollars and most people can't afford to do multiple expensive jobs at one time. I would revise this to say that you should tackle the small things at the get go, but save up for the big stuff.   




 You sound exactly like my mechanic, looking at Lexus now.  









 I've noticed this in the past, but am currently watching US Open replays for today. 




 As someone that lives in Montreal, but works North of the city, I see the traffic headed in every single day. Fortunately I get to drive by at 120 and wave.
