 But mooooommm 




 HE'S 14 AND THAT IS ECHOJACKAL8 




 You fucking piece of shit. You are part of the problem that the Internet is objectified in this world. Have some sympathy for a REAL Redditor with a HORRIBLE autistic problem and stop being such a jackdaw. This is someone's SJW or stalker. This comment will probably not do anything to change you from being so rude but I want you to think if this is really the type of user you want to be.  









 Or a colonoscopist

 OP please deliver 




 Why is /r/askscience downvoting a question about science? This person is just asking something, he isn't stating anything false. 




 Yes, because watching people slice off their friend's body parts makes you think it's a good idea 




 Probably knowing that it's final. That yeah, he will never actually taktake actions to emend his mistakes, that he will never demonstrate he's sorry, that now the story has ended with the same bitter taste it began with. You have that certainty now, every piece of hope, even as much microscopically small it was it's now completely gone, for ever. He was in no way your father other than biologically, but the story didn't finish yet. Now it is.  

That's what hurts. 




 How did he stick his head in the collider? Aren't they supposed to run in a vacuum? 




 well i'd imagine most hard drugs must have some kind of appeal if some people are willing to destroy themselves and everything they hold dear for one more hit.  

I had problems with addiction in my past.
 Generally at this point you descrine doing the drug of choices isn't fun anymore, you chase those first highs when you felt amazing and awesome, but it's never ever the same. You kind of get satisfied for a bit and then crave more, and more, until you have no drug left and then you feel like fucking shit. Then you go and buy more, and the cycle repeats.  

You can't stop doing the drug but not because it feels super awesome, but rather because not using feels like fucking hell to an addict. 

 









 Hahaha I don't normaly comment on how good a comment is, but this is the best whoosh GIF I've seen by far 




 Whoosh 




 I'm trying to think outside the box here, I know this question is probably really stupid, but how do we know is mass causing gravity instead of lack of "no-mass"? I mean, suppose that empty space pushes you evenly in every direction, so, you stay stationary. But put an object with mass close enough to you to interfere with that pushing force, and you start going towards that object, because now your receive the pushing force from one side more than other.  

Does that make any kind of sense?
 




 Well, towards the end of the 90s (1998) it was discovered that the expansion of the universe is (very contrary to the belief in that time) occurring at an accelerating rate. Before that it was thought that galaxies moved away from each other more slowly as time passed, but since 1998 we know it's not, they move away faster and faster, and will continue to do so. One of the most accepted theories to explain this weird effect from the universe is the Dark Energy Theory, but it's 1:15am here and I'm about to sleep, so I'll leave that to another redditor or go into it a bit more tomorrow. 




 These two, both from /r/AskReddit:

-[What is the scariest theory known to man?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/31nbca/whats_the_scariest_theory_known_to_man/)   

-[[Serious] [NSFW] Redditors who have been on the brink of death/legally dead, can you describe what it felt like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2qmt72/serious_nsfw_redditors_who_have_been_on_the_brink/) 

Both had very deep and mindblowing questions. I particularly like the one from the redditors who have died, because most of them talk about the acceptance of death in those final moments, and brings my mind at peace knowing that maybe in those few last instants, I'll be ok with what's happening. 




 The ultimate paternity test 




 Fuck. 




 Dude that's the wrong song, you put Darude - Sandstorm 




 "Just remember though, the old, happy, not depressed you is still in there. Somewhere. You just need to find it."

Fuck man, my emotions went from 0 to 100 right fucking there. That hit so close to home... I was so happy just a year ago, nothing like I feel now. Nothing at all. I needed to read that. Thank you.
 




 I bet it was caustic soda, here in Argentina something similar happened, a girl drank a cocktail that had some of caustic soda in it and burned the shit out of her, but luckily she instantly spitted it and survived IIRC. She was hospitalised a few weeks though, that shit burns like nothing. 




 That's exactly my point, it's real, way too real, and I like this drama but after a bit dose of it I need some stupidshit drama to cool down a little. I mean, OP fucking died 3 times, I need to read 2 people fighting about which way is the correct way to grill a cheese sandwich. 




 COLD AS MOTHERLAND 




 Chose the finale where Roman dies to avoid this 




 It's like we need some eyebleach drama, I need to read some kids fighting over their rights to call other people names based on their physical properties, darknet dramas are always about death and super illegal shit 




 Fucking karma hoards 




 Excellent response, thanks so much! 




 Yeah we're not going to laugh about people forcing a mentally disabled person to eat shit and maggots. 




 I'm sorry for the stupid question, I'm a bit out of the loop here, there are no more books written so far? Does this means I can now read book spoilers without being spoiled? 




 You sound like a wonderful group 




 Man, I'm all for the human approach, but when I read things like *"Matthew was in hysterics  traumatised. He hasnt cried since he was six but he was shaking and crying"* and the whole article that comes with that, I just want to boil these people in diahrrea. 




 Oh god, I remember this... I mean, seeing it on TV, I was poor as fuck, but still, the nostalgia is strong. 




 I have Senn HD202, and the first couple of times I wore them backwards, then realised and changed it, but from the design they have the first reaction seems to put them wrong. I also saw a lot of people who used mines wore them backwards at first. Weird.  




 *flexes* 




 If you ever had a threesome, in average you slept with more than 1 sexual partner in every sexual encounter that you had in your life.  

Averages are fun. 




 Go to the bathroom, empty your bladder and then drink lots of water. Your bladder will stay empty by the time you are asleep
 




 Start a martial art. It's never too late, and the learning curve is fairly fast at the very beginning. Think it about it this way, 4 months from now you are going to wish you started today, make it happen! 




 I saw this exact photo on facebook a few days ago and gave it a try yesterday, it was amazing!  




 Even the link has three **-_-** faces 




 It costs 200 dollars. Remember that it spawns on helipads and parking lots, usually not more than 1,3km away from your char. That's cool.  

Personally I'm now going for the new sports car (can't recall the name), I love how it looks and sounds. I already have a Kuruma, a Hydra, and had multiple cars in the middle that I bought and eventually sold. When I get it I don't know what I'm going to get. 




 If you are going to fuck my fridge you better click on that link bro 




 A 69 in ASCII-land. 




 That's super awesome. 




 I was born on the 30th of September, 1999, making me 15 years old at this moment. I was born in that decade.

You were born like 2 months before the 90s ended, and you have literally 0 memories from that decade. /r/lewronggeneration much?

 The smart thing to do here is to get a really strong computer virus and have it ask for more RAM.

 The only reason they aren't fat themselves is because of all the circlejerking and calories burning it comes with 




 That was sarcasm (just letting OP know in advance) 




 What if our universe was created in the last release of HL3? What if a bunch of universes are created when they release it in this one?  




 Clever 




 Are Nazi Nazis the ones that correct you about wrong Nazi facts? 




 The worst part for me is that FPH is crying over "censorship" and if you even said that a fat person was human, they'd ban you from the subreddit and downvote you to hell. 

"Go be fat somewhere else" they said. Well, go be haters somewhere else, fuckers.

 I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO FEEL 




 This. This right here has to be the name we choose for this event. Like the nude leaks was "the fappening", this shall be "The Reddit Wedding". Spread the word.

 Does it drive better than the zentorno? I was always mad at r* for making the best race car in the game so ugly. 









 I would but my internet fucking sucks rotten dicks :( 




 Dear god, what's wrong with some people? I have a friend that went out with a dude once, the guy was 'fine', but as soon as the date was over he texts her "did you like me? you think I'm masculine?". WTF... What kind of question is that? 




 That'll be $3.99 




 First one is free.

 If you want to, PM me 




 True50, the page, allows you to do that. It redirects one address to either one of two others. 









 As a photographer, I photoshop a lot also. I agree with your post 100%, but just for clarification, the two images OP posted aren't even the same photograph. You can tell by the positioning of the hand and the arm tattoo, they are shot from a little bit different angles.  




 I found it very funny, can I upload it to my Facebook? I'll link to yours with credit of course. 




 Needs more flexing

 Aren't you the guy that writes awesome stuff? For real, I love your writting, man. 




 Aren't you that relaxed guy from Redd-? Wait, no, you're not. 




 [He's most likely a dude.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/zisq6/down_45_lbs_and_gained_a_smile/c651568?context=3) He (?) says totally out of verse and in reply to a comment "Actually, by 'this dude' - I meant me."

Damn, that took long to find. 




 *One million walkers!* 




 Hahaha I lost it at the arm falling on top of the crates 




 Are you Warlizard from the Warlizard Gaming Forums? 




 Seems like it isn't my best day commenting 




 You're saying that a teacher advicing students to study, because otherwise they won't meet the knowledge to approve the class is a threat. I believe you need to learn the concept of threat, because with that logic every advice in "don't do X because Y (bad thing) is going to happen to you" form is a threat to you.   
  
As other people said, if he's doing this out of pure justice seeking, he should also in all the other "sellers" that aren't registered as well. Besides, being in the legal right doesn't mean it isn't a dick move, OP may face jailtime because a very stupid thing.  




 I think you need to learn the meaning of the word "threat", man. 




 Thanks for the correction! I don't know why people are downvoting you, you were right, I meant peek, not peak. 




 Also depending on the direction in which you turned our it, you may have sent it backwards. Try remembering a few days back. 




 Click it... You know you want to... Just a quick ~~peak~~peek, no one will know, it'll be out secret... 




 So, according to that logic if a teacher tells her students "if you don't study you are going to fail the class", she's threatening them. Please, stop saying ridiculous things, I'm not treathing anyone. 




 Yeah I think I'm on the wrong internet again 




 I'm not threatening anyone, I'm saying what I'm reading, if this guy gets a bad rep *(he certainly is at least in this subreddit, and it isn't a stretch to think this will be mentioned in other MTG forums)* it will impact badly on his sales, how's that a threat? 




 I've seen a lot of comments complaining about this, the option is there in control settings. In Spanish it has a misleading name (something that in English would translate to "previous car weapon", in Spanish it sounds like it's taking about in-car-built weapons) and assuming the amount of comments I'm seeing here about this matter I'm assuming it also does on English.  

It's among the top 5, just set it to mouse wheel down and you can go back and forth with pistols, grenades, etc on your car with your wheel. Pretty useful, I don't know why this isn't default.  

Cheers! 




 I'm pretty sure you are doing this in order to get money from Tobias, but I can see why you are and will continue to deny this. 

You will say that money isn't your primary interest in this course of action, but you know it is. Look, I'm not looking for you to admit it, I'm just saying that you and everyone else here know what's this about. So, I'm going to tell you that besides this being the biggest jerk move I've heard in quite some time, and apart from me criticizing the lack of ethics in your actions (which clearly is a topic you don't care about), I'm going to speak your language: this is a terrible, terrible decision economically-wise for your business.     

Reddit is a huge platform, and you should consider that gaining bad reputation here can really hurt your business. And I mean **really**. The word will come out and a lot of people in the MTG niche will stop buying from you, and as I know you don't care about justice or whatever justification you want to tag on this dick move, but only about gaining more money, I am telling you this is one of the worst ways to accomplish that. You may gain some cash from OP, but that's nothing compared to what you will lose against a angry community that will boicott your operation by not buying anymore.  

So, in the slim chance you'll reply to this, I know you are going to say money isn't your goal here etc etc. But yeah, you, me, and everyone else here knows that's just gibberish. Consider what I'm saying to you, it's in your business best interest.
