 It is interesting that there are some games, like F/SN, that are longer than the Bible. (The NIV translation of the Bible clocks in at 726,109 words) 




 That isn't even the largest amount of words in a literary work. The Wheel of Time series has 4,410,036 words. (Yes, that is 4.4+ million words) 




 The light novel has been translated father than the manga and there is even the anime which is starting in the beginning of July. 




 That is why we no longer use capes! 




 Off the top of my head:

Attack on Titan, Log Horizon, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Baccano, Kekkai Sensen, Psycho Pass (Some questionable content in first episode), Zetsuen no Tempest, Xam'd: Lost Memories (This was released in the US before it was in Japan as it was, originally, exclusive to PSN),

last but not least ~~Space Dandy~~. (Forgot about the take on Hooters) 




 There is also [T-Rex no Kanojo](http://myanimelist.net/manga/88537/T-Rex_na_Kanojo), which is pretty good but there aren't too many chapters out.

You might want to check out the [recommendations on MAL from Monster Musume.](http://myanimelist.net/manga/36213/Monster_Musume_no_Iru_Nichijou/userrecs) 




 Why limit yourself to one? You are dealing with a genie, ask for more! (Well, not too much as you want to avoid flooding the market) 




 It is about the same amount of text as the main Lord of the Rings Trilogy which sits about ~470000 words.

Witcher 3 has less text than Final Fantasy VII which has ~600000 words. 




 The person you replied to is the guy who is making it. 




 I know for R;B1 they kept the main plot points but reworked the scenes enough that people consider it to be two separate games.

EDIT: They also revamped the graphics and replaced some of the characters. [The Wikipedia entry about it goes into more detail.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperdimension_Neptunia_%28video_game%29#Hyperdimension_Neptunia_Re.3BBirth_1) 




 It is half off as well so if you've played the first it might be a good idea to pick it up now. 

I just started R;B1, so I'm not sure how R;B2 changed in terms of combat and what not. 




 Depends on a number of things:

* Number of hunts fought in,

* Looted gear

* Raids/Dungeons run 

* First time bonus in raids/dungeons

* Progress on Relic weapon

* etc...

Thankfully, the game doesn't require an instantaneous jump from i50 to i90 as the 3 main raids (LOTA, ST, WoD) are (i50, i70, i90 respectively)

I'd say about 20-30 hours of gameplay. (Maybe more, maybe less, depends on the amount of grind you want to do within a period of time.) 




 Worked for me! I tried it last time they did a promo, but it had ended so I hadn't made an account. 




 The only identification you have to provide is your SSN, which is used for tax purposes. 




 If you are in the US, you can use mTurk and it pays to an Amazon Payment account or you can cash it directly for an Amazon gift card. This is what I do when I want to buy something without spending from my bank account or credit card. 




 You'll need to increase your item level to at least 90. (This is the number above your character) 




 800 




 I'm surprised that no one caught how the starting line sign is similar to the [Crash Team Racing logo.](https://i.imgur.com/3RpHFmw.jpg) 




 I know this is a bit old, but for those of you wondering, the number that Chain called, which gives the time of day, is real. While it isn't in Japanese, NIST provides a Telephone Time-of-Day Service and it, "is used to synchronize clocks and watches and for the calibration of stopwatches and timers."

Here is the website about it: http://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/grp40/ttds.cfm

 Heck, I've gotten spoofed calls that claim to be my phone number. How wrong is that? 




 The main connotation is that someone could have been using your internet for nefarious purposes (copyright infringement, illegal goods/services) and you would be responsible.

The best way to fix it is to completely uninstall the extension and program and check the registry for any lingering files and such. 




 With the hobbit, it is ~600,000 words. 




 Here are a few that I found off of MAL that might work:

* [Natsume Yuujinchou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4081/Natsume_Yuujinchou)

* [Sakamichi no Apollon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12531/Sakamichi_no_Apollon) - Focuses on Jazz in Japan during the late 1960s

* [Chihayafuru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10800/Chihayafuru) - A really good shoujo adaptation that is popular with both genders

* [Zetsuen no Tempest](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest) - Really good mix of fantasy and reality (Draws upon Shakespeare for inspiration) 




 For good reason considering that the manga for Nodame was published in a Josei magazine. (Josei is the term for the older women, 18-30ish, demographic.) 




 Their MAL was in their flair.

 While it isn't an anime, *Ready Player One* will be getting adapted as a movie and Steven Spielberg will be directing it. 

[Source](http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/25/spielberg-directing-ready-player-one/) 




 To give people an idea on the length (word count):

* Lord of the Rings (Main Trilogy Only): ~470,000

* Final Fantasy VII: ~600,000

* Mistborn Trilogy: 693,428

* Bible (NIV): 726,109

* F/SN VN: 820,595 (Based upon the English word count)

* --- UBW Route: 219,495

* Wheel of Time series: **4,410,036** (This is not a typo) 




 "[Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5781/Isekai_no_Seikishi_Monogatari)" would be a perfect fit. 




 No, you're right. 




 "Row-ri" would be a passable pronunciation of it, but you would have to keep in mind that it would be the "Ro" from "Row" without the "w" at the end. Technically, it is closer to "R-ri" 




 The reason for it is that an "o" followed by an "u" is pronounced by holding the "o" sound for another syllable length rather than saying "o" then "u" and it is denoted by the smaller katakana (or hiragana should it be in hiragana).  




 Not so much a song, but an artist. I recently found out about the Vitamin String Quartet and they have been doing string covers of popular songs and some original stuff, they have ~250 albums out all focusing of a different artist or album that they are covering.


A friend used their music during their wedding and I can't stop listening to their stuff. 




 You could always send it through Waifu2x and have it upscale the image. (It does it a lot better and without as much detail lost as photoshop would incur.)

EDIT: Got back to my computer, [here](https://i.imgur.com/flHpNno.jpg) is the upscaled image. 




 It is a parody of the racing scenes from the anime *Initial D*. 




 What about powerline ethernet adapters? That is data going across power lines! 




 Apparently it did happen. 




 How about on the backs of hippos? 




 There is always /r/trueanime but that is a smaller community. 




 Pac-Man was also in the Mario Kart arcade games. 




 It will be interesting to see how this compares to *Ballroom e Youkoso* in the portrayal of dancing. BeY is such that even I, who isn't even athletic at all, want to try ballroom dancing as it appears to be more than what most people think of it.


EDIT: Fixed tense of a word. 




 I'm not too surprised. Yeah, getting the rights to the lyrics would be a pain but musically it fits. 

It may cause the manga to become dated quicker but it is a great song choice. They used a song that is popular enough that people can remember bits and pieces from a few lyrics along with the swelling music in the climax.  




 As the question has inherent spoilers, could you please mark the text in your post accordingly? 




 I managed to find a copy of the Final Fantasy: Anthology for PS1 today at a local store but much to my detriment, FFV seems to crash 50-75% of the time when saving which will make it difficult or impossible to progress.

What can I do to fix it? I've tried turning off smoothing and such to no avail.

I was able to save once, but other than that it will always go to a black screen when saving. 

---

If there isn't a fix, I guess I could hook my up my old PS2 and play it that way. My concern is that with how most TVs are forgoing the composite/component connectors it would be a stop gap for about a decade or so and the FF series is something I'd like to keep around for longer than that. 




 It can't hurt to ask as the most they would say is no, especially with the amount of time that you had put in on the game. 




 Quoting /u/koredozo's above comment.

 Per one of the tweet replies: "There's a vendor you can buy gear from named Monst3r. There's about a 1/500 chance Ryan appears instead" 




 I think a mod commented in a thread last week that they remove any top-level comments that are less than 100 characters as they are normally low quality. 




 The lighting on the second to last photo is phenomenal as it gives an entirely different tone/look to the figure . 




 I'm surprised that they didn't get the rights to have the original song in there. Heck, it is on Disc 2 of the GuP OST as well so I'd think that getting the rights to the OST would cover it. 




 I think that max score was cheated anyways since all of the closest ones are half that. 




 It could be the reddit hug of death as people are going on to upscale/denoise their images. 




 I didn't have it do an upscale, just a denoise on an image and it dealt really well with the gradients in the background and the details though some information is lost. Then again, this is zoomed in at about 300% actual size so it is negligible.

[Left is before, right is after](https://i.imgur.com/KkY7FXI.jpg) 




 It wasn't hard to do. All I did was utilize a machine learning program that someone created with the purpose of upscaling anime/manga related images (such as fanart and what not) and it does it really really well. 




 [Here is a less blurry one at 1080x1920](https://i.imgur.com/Z4kLAhD.png). I used the waifu2x site to upscale the original and then used gimp and increased the canvas size. 




 [Here](https://i.imgur.com/lzi3td5.jpg) is a larger version than the 1080p one if you'd like. 




 So basically you want us to sign up using the only link which is a referral link so that we are now the suckers who are trying to make money/games from this and all you do is sit back and profit from it.

Yeah, no. 




 It is a car without the obvious police livery/decals, but it still sports the obvious things such as a spotlight, multiple radio antennas, bar lights (those there are normally inside the car) and so on. 




 [Here you go.](https://i.imgur.com/cjEsPVR.png) I utilized a deep convolutional neural network that was trained over 3000+ anime/manga related images to resize the original and then used GIMP to get the finalized image size since the program could only do 1.6 or 2x the original resolution.

 You need to save the page, for some reason you can't directly save it. Try doing File - Save Page As. 




 It is also really good at removing jpeg noise from an image. This will make some of my .jpg wallpapers usable since I won't see as much, if any, of the artifacting. Case in point, [left is before, right is after](https://i.imgur.com/KkY7FXI.jpg). 




 Yep, CUDA is Nvidia graphics cards only. 




 It seems as though he fed a natural learning program that is designed to read and produce images a few thousand anime related images to learn from. From that it seems to recreate the image rather than simply touching it up.

Case in point, it removed a lot of noise from a pretty complex wallpaper that I had. [Left is before, Right is after](https://imgur.com/KkY7FXI) 




 Could you please mark the spoilers? 




 Clannad and subsequently Clannad ~After Story~, heck a certain scene in After Story initiated a bout of depression the lasted for about three months. 




 She shows up in one of the earlier chapters of the manga so if it shows anything from the brother's work then we might. 




 FFXIV has a two week trial and it allows you to do most things up until level 20. 

The one cool thing about this is that one character can be all of the classes and spec differently so you could, given enough time, get a number of classes up to level 20 including the crafting classes! 




 What server are you on? I'm about to resub and if you are Zalarea, I can introduce you to my old FC and add you to the LS that the FC and some others use that is pretty active. 




 Do you know when the OST will be out? 

Also, I wish I knew what the opera-esque song in the beginning was. 




 The hard part about LovePlus is that it was never, officially, brought over to the US and it is put away as a niche within the niche of visual novels. 

It is only available in English through a patch that someone put out years ago. 

You may want to look at the visual novel community as a whole as it is starting to gain ground in the western markets.

Some examples: 

* [The release of the first Grisaia game on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/345610/)

* [The crowdfunding initiative to bring over Clannad in English.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sekaiproject/clannad-official-english-release/description)

* Popularity of indie game such as "Long Live the Queen" or the reception of the free visual novel, "Katawa Shoujo". 




 If you haven't seen it yet, I feel this way about Kekkai Sensen. I hadn't paid much attention to it, but I tried the first episode and then proceeded to binge watch what is out so far. 




 You had the wrong flair.

You had: Identification X

You need: Identification [Checkmark]

I have changed it accordingly, but please remember that when your identification request is fulfilled that you change it to the checkmark one.
 




 I would say it is a reference. There were magazines with some characters from "Shuffle!" on it in the original series' first season, so it wouldn't be the first time that the Haruhi has brought in things from other anime. 




 Good luck, there are a number of choices in the first ten minutes or so. 




 You can fix that by using http://azure.kdays.cn/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/AlphaROMdiE-Build20140214.rar and dragging the sigilusengine.exe onto the open program. Then use the shortcut that the program creates to play it. 




 When you cook/heat alcoholic drinks, the alcohol burns off. This is why people don't have to be carded when buying beer battered onion rings or other things that have used alcohol to add flavor. 




  I don't know what to call this face but I absolutely love it.

It kinda reminds me of how the [Chitoge nendoroid](http://images.goodsmile.info/cgm/images/product/20140430/4410/28872/large/fbc4d3d6499715db6291711189f2337d.jpg) looks. 




 Whoever posted the album added the two images after I had posted my tl;dr. Odds are they did it to be funny as the story made it seem as though they let all of the deer go without harm. 




 I have no idea as I have yet to play them, I would just know because /r/visualnovels would have gone crazy over the announcement. 




 I hope that when/if Clannad sells well on Steam that key looks into having you guys bring over *Angel Beats ~1^st Beat~*. 




 It gets worse, they have been injecting their own websites as well. For the past few weeks, I have been redirected to "activate" my already working internet multiple times. They'll even go so far to replace portions of pages with the activation webpage that does nothing other than interrupt my browsing at random.

The internet is, and has been, paid for month after month with Comcast since 2004-ish when they bought out Alephia.  




 I had read the whole thing, but I summarized based upon what I could remember. There was a lot in there about the tendencies and bahaviors of wild animals and they would choose the lesser of two evils, to which they gave an example of how a seal jumped on a boat to avoid a whale.  




 Deer swam, went too far, got cold, went towards boat, guy on boat lassoed the deer, deer got on boat and brought back to shore. 




 Not that I know of. I think Mangagamer has only licensed the Higurashi series.

If you can find the games online the fan translation is, reportedly, good and the creator of the game approved of the group so much that he used their name in one of the later chapters of the Umineko series. 




 I would but two things:

1. I am double bass, if I was a first Tenor I could (maybe) pull it off, but my voice range is from G1 to (on a good day) a G4 while LISA's voice is much higher than that.

2. My Japanese is horrible

 




 Yeah, I figured it would catch someone but I couldn't figure out a better way to word it but still have the title short enough to not be a full sentence. 




 It almost seems as though the vehicle had too much control and it didn't seem as floaty as Wipeout. (This is why wipeout had the airbreaks as they were used to finesse the vehicle to do tight turns at much faster speeds than normally possible.) 




 The hard part about recreating songs in minecraft is the combination of the fixed tempo (2.5, 5, or 10 ticks/s) and the really small scale that the noteblocks provide. It difficult to find something that sounds good within the confines of what the game provides. 









 For those of you interested in buying and playing the VN, it releases on the 15th on Steam!

EDIT: [Here is the link to the Steam page.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/310360/) 




 Gotta go fast 




  "It's Midori! (_)"

Fixed that for you. 




 Probably, but it kinda looks like an emoticon version of Sapphire. 




 Go post in /r/tsunderesharks, you will have a field day of karma. 




 Actually when it comes to standardization of weights everything is metric as a pound is described as a portion of a kilogram. (I don't remember the exact number off the top of my head) 




 But you did remember him, hence your post. 




 He did. 




 The August curse strikes again. Heck, Yoake Mae is completely translated and edited but the guy behind it has stalled it until he feels like completing it. :( 




 Top one as I would know what would happen as there is a [manga about this exact thing.](http://myanimelist.net/manga/16304/Gacha_Gacha_-_Secret) 




 [This one.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKRnEOUxZm0) 




 It is a reference to a scene in Jurassic Park. 




 You may say that last part, but your story says otherwise. What you did was, basically, money laundering where in a criminal sends money around to put it "through the wash" so the dirty money isn't as "dirty".

Odds are you won't be able to rescind this and you may lose your account. (I think the only time Valve fixes this is when/if your account is hacked and then used for those purposes but this is not the case for you.) 




 The reason for this is that the camera's shutter is/was synced to the helicopter's blades rotating making it appear as though the blades are not moving as it is taking the frame at the same time every time. 




 Sorry, I just knew that it was legal to listen to a preview of a song on iTunes and I knew the anime OST was on there for people to buy so I linked to it. 




 I haven't been able to play the trial but odds are it is track #8 on the OST. (My Most Precious Treasure) 

If you can, could you listen to the sample of the track on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/tvanimeshon-angel-beats!-original/id842476044) to see if it is or not? (Otherwise I'll have to watch out for the OST from the game as I want it if that is the case)

^ It is on the US iTunes. 




 It isn't the full episode. /r/anime has allowed people to share scenes in the comments and as links before without issue.  




 No reason to be sorry!  




 Auld Lang Syne.

When I went to Japan, pretty much every business, as it was closing, would play this over the speakers and it was a nice way of getting people to head out for the night. 




 I hate the bad rap those people have been giving Celiacs as they have an actual reason to be gluten-free. 




 You were using the wrong flair: 

You had: [Identification X]

You needed: [Request]

You were asking for something similar to ____ therefore it is a request. 

I have changed it accordingly, but please remember to flair correctly in the future. 




 **Issue:** Steam will constantly put current downloads into a queue rather than just downloading them.

I've never set up scheduling on Steam but every minute or so Steam will put a currently downloading game/update into a queue. It is getting to the point of being really really annoying.

Heck, within the time of typing this out I've had to restart the download for Tera three or four times. (I've lost count) 




 I don't think there is a translation of the **novel** it is based on. (Yet)

Invariably someone will do it as Hyouka has been translated that was also an actual novel. 




 Your description is wrong, they do not pay you for messaging your friends but for receiving ads. The advertisers, or those sending you unsolicited messages, have to pay "gems" which the user receives and they can then turn it into digital currency. 




 there doesn't seem to be

anything here 




 Have you read Ender's Game and subsequently Speaker for the Dead?  




 How about where the company allocates X% of the profits of the month from that game to modders and then the modders get a percentage of the allocated amount based on the number of views divided over the total views?

In short form:

((Your mod's views)/(Total Mod Views))*(X% of profit or funds allocated to modders)



 




 They are there to lessen the chance of bright flashes of light causing seizures in those watching it. The BD/DVD releases don't have to have this filter. 




 Sorry, it is a long title which would make it seem wordy. The full title is, MuvLuv Alternative: Total Eclipse. 

I just figured that those who didn't recognize MLA would avoid clicking on it. 




 If you hug the walls you can make it to Mor Dhona around level 25. 




 It is often said, but the best soundtrack is one that you don't notice but gives weight and meaning beyond that of just the voices and sound effects. A great example of this would be Han Zimmer's work in the movie, *Interstellar*. 




 I was watching episode 7 of MuvLuv Alternative: Total Eclipse and in one of the latter scenes the Lieutenant has a bath robe on but it is being worn [*right over left*](https://i.imgur.com/fsOmr8j.jpg).

I didn't know, or pay attention to this, but in Japan all robes whether they are kimonos, yutakas, bath robes, etc are all supposed to be worn *left over right* as the reverse is only used in funerals. This is so ingrained in the culture that during my class trip last year to Japan during the initial orientation about the yutaka and such they specified strict adherence to this.

You'd think with her being a stickler, in the same episode, about being Japanese that she'd keep to the conventions over her own culture.

Does anyone have an explanation for this or was it just a minor detail that an animator got wrong and it failed to be corrected for the blurays?
