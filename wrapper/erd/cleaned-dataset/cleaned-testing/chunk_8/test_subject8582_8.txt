A Mexican standoff is 3+ people with guns pointed at each other. 

That's a regular fucking standoff

I trusted you, Dan. You let me down.  




 One of the more "What the fuck, Japan?" things I've seen today.  




 Southern U.S. 

God, I feel like you're just gonna lynch me whenever you open your fucking inbred mouth. And I'm white.  




 Don't say that word. Don't say that word. Don't say that word.  




 Or the one where some guy played DOOM with a set of toasters.  




 And covered by flash.  




 In that case, what order should I watch them in? "Armageddon" doesn't make it sound like the first. 




 Well. Time to go watch that. Can I start with this or one of the other Getter Robo-es?  




 As long as your phone is above 20% when you screenshot, I don't care what you're using.  




 WHY does Nintendo not want me to have Rosalina? 




 YOU MOTHER FUCKER 




 Really, was there ever any doubt that Anno despises his fans? 




 Probably closer to 3 years old, considering they're almost definitely using the Skyrim engine.  




 Comin' again to save the motherfuckin' day yeah 




 I saw a couple at my local Toys R Us in NJ.  




 "Come with me if you want to get in the fucking robot" 




 The world needs more mecha cosplays. Especially if they're this tier. I mean god damn this is nice.  




 "WE'VE GOT SPLATOON MOTHERFUCKERS! SUCK OUR DICK!" 




 I love Gunbuster, but I don't want to spend like $200 on one.  




 Megazord, Gurren Lagann, Eva Unit-01, Big O(?), Megas XLR, no idea, Gunbuster, no idea. Guess I gotta go watch more super robot shows.  




 I had never even considered that, but it actually makes *more* sense that SEELE put the mask on Lilith rather than the other way around. She does drop it the moment she regains her soul. And she has a different mask in Rebuild.  




 The only source on that article is a couple Xbox One users. Take that for what you will.  




 BAN MARJORAM'S MASK! 




 What the fuck am I looking at?  




 Someone shoot me.  




 Not enough geometry 0/10

Really though, that is a great cosplay.  




 I'm going away for a few weeks this summer and I want to play some Smash while I'm gone. Thing is, I don't want to lug around a monitor. Can I use an iPad (or Hell, even my phone) as a display?

 Are you Santa? Is this the unicorn I wanted when I was six?

 She must have been one of those 40,000 because she just got owned. 









 Shinji: Eevee. Ability: Run Away.  




 After episode 26, watch the director's cuts of episodes 21-24. They fill in a lot of the stuff that was in Death and Rebirth but not the original and is more or less essential to EoE. And going to EoE straight from episode 26 will leave you very disoriented from a timeline perspective.  




 They tried to make him more "kewl". I think that was around the time everyone involved in the good Sonic games either had a collective aneurysm or left. Or both.  




 Do people on this sub not understand the concept of satire? 




 I think I might actually use this.  




 I've been meaning to watch this show, but I still have one question:

Is it about incest? Because I want to watch a brother and sister bonding, not brother and sister bondage.  




 But that wasn't *really* Mami, right? The only magical girls who are actually in Rebellion are Godoka, Sayaka, and Homura. And Charlotte.  




 I never noticed his profanity until it was gone. It just weaves so naturally into his dialogue.  




 Thor's in his Asgard, all's right with the world.  









 I haven't seen Kung Fury yet and it looks like all of you have lost your fucking minds.  




 BROJOB! BROJOB! 




 Rebellion all took place in Homura's labyrinth, didn't it? So unless one of them went witch during the fight (as evidenced by the Walpurgisnacht battle, this isn't probable) Rebellion wouldn't really do much. At least, not for Homura. And I did specify no Godoka.   




 The MP-Eva's had their own cores. Plus, they weren't starting 3I by themselves, they used the ascended Unit-01 as a conductor for their own Anti-AT fields. And the Lance's. And Giant Naked Rei's.  




 I made sure it wasn't unit-01 almost entirely for that purpose. Unit-02 (as a child of Adam) doesn't have the same impact potential as Unit-01. So no divine ascension here.  




 Mami, Sayaka, Madoka (not Godoka), Homura, and Kyoko fight against a standard Evangelion (to be specific, use the production model Unit-02). The battle takes place in the Tokyo-3. Unit-02 gets the progressive knife and nothing else. 

(Homura doesn't get to rewind time for a win.) 




 I can't tell what level of irony this is working on. It's like a Lovecraftian abomination of a meme.  




 this generation ruined '90s kids. I want '00s '90s kids.  




 In regards to the goat thing, that is the proper word. And it actually was a young goat [first](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/32732/when-did-kid-start-to-mean-child), though this person is still performing mental gymnastics that could easily win a gold medal at the oppression olympics.  




 "I'm just trying to make sure that I can blame patriarchy for everything, even if it makes no god damn sense. **THEY'RE** the crazy ones, not me!" 




 Buzzfeed isn't exactly in a position to criticize someone else's journalism.  




 That's Colonel Sanders, obviously.  




 Private cash money is robbery.  




 My first words were the script to Army of Darkness.  




 I live in Jersey, and I was a victim of Sandy. So I'd like you all to join me in giving Ted Cruz a [Jersey Salute](https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fi62.tinypic.com%2F2ica6h5.png t=552 c=dg_CbK-ISEYGGA)

 He's done it before. Off the top of my head, he took a dig at anime protagonists when he mentioned one tossing off to unconscious women in his C/Katherine review, and he portrayed our very own waifu wars in his ET for Atari 2600 review.  




 They feel all other wounds like they would if they were actually happening (even sustaining the same injuries as the Eva if their synch ratio is high enough). So Asuka and Rei will feel the same, no questions asked. But the Eva has no balls, partly because they're angels and partly because they're moms. So it's more likely that Shinji, Kaworu, and Toji would feel the same as they would if they didn't have male genitals. Just sorta... under their dicks.  




 It's like Sonic the Hedgehog, but for grandmas instead of autistic teenagers.  




 He'd tear them right back out again. 

(Really though, [I don't think he'd be too broken up about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xew8SXUMxsE)) 




 I had been planning on buying an i5 for my new build, but now I'm gonna start looking at the AMD alternatives.  




 [Anime spoilers](/s "It's because of the Life Fibers. It's our clue that she isn't actually completely human") 




 [TTGL spoiler](/s "Isn't it because she was the Antispiral's messenger? And therefore not completely human?") 




 Holy shit, this is exactly what I need.  




 To be fair, if we did bring him back we probably could fix that. Cochlear implants and all that.  




 Attack on Titan is the same deal. Pretty much 100% Germany.  




 It's like Venom learned from Bardiel.  









 The entirety of Cut, Paste, and Kill is great. My favorite is Powerkranz 




 Japanese reads right to left, so most of their books are written accordingly. When localized, most translators choose to keep this to avoid screwing up the art. This ain't always the case, but it usually is.  




 This might be true for Red and Leaf, maybe even Gold and Crystal, but once legendaries and gods and all that get thrown into the plot, the whole theory goes right down the drain. Specifically, Arceus in Gen IV, Xerneas in Gen VI, and the whole plot of Gen V. The fact that God himself appears before you and deems you worthy of capturing him would imply that Lucas and Dawn are in fact humans of His design, not an android created by someone else. Because if he were to appear before the worthiest trainer, wouldn't it be the guy who designed your AI?

I think the theory that Pokemon's humans are actually Pokemon (and not humans as we know them) is still the strongest. It has the most supported evidence, and explains everything that would be explained by this theory. In the games, we see that Pokemon don't need to eat or sleep a long as they aren't damaged. Since the trainer never takes any damage, they can just keep going forever.  




 I would recommend the original 21-24, followed by episodes 25/26. The Director's cuts seem to be more of a setup to End of Evangelion than the originals, which led more so into the original ending. They really only have some extra scenes (and one infamous scene from episode 24 cut shorter). If nothing else, it's easier to appreciate the director's cuts after having seen the original episodes. Also, the director's cuts lead directly into the film, as even the preview for episode 24' shows one of the scenes from the film. Going straight to EoE from episode 26 will leave you disoriented from a timeline standpoint.  




 Komm, Susser Tod (Tumbling Down) would be a good choice as well, except for the fact that it's pretty long. Fly Me to the Moon is shorter, as well as having less of the weeb factor.  




 That was pretty fun.

The next one should be Fly Me To the Moon, I kick ass at that song.  




 I ended up getting a Nidoran F on Route 35 and double kicked my way through the gym.  




 The movie in question is called Death and Rebirth. It's technically in two parts. Death is just a 40 minute recap episode, and Rebirth is the first quarter-ish of End of Evangelion. So if you just watched the series, move on to End of Evangelion. 

Though you should remember to watch episodes 21-24 Director's Cut after episodes 1-26. Then EoE. I haven't seen anyone mention that.  




 [proof](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Lou6W9G5dnU/TFetpEDsklI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/hl22FtxOwQc/s320/mari.png) 




 I believe it has a built in _ macro.  




 Yeah. The worst part is that I made it through the gym without a single death, so I foolishly believed I could survive *this* battle too. 

I think they call that hubris. 




 This baka fucking gaijin probably hasn't even seen Cory in the House.  









 I would debate hunger actually. In every PMD game I only ever found it annoying, and I was actually pretty glad to see it gone.  




 I think it goes without saying that *Fathoms* is better than G98 




 It looks decent enough. Is it worth spending the money for a paperback copy? 




 The latter. Sonic and autistic fanart go together like 3D sonic games and shitty quality assurance.

 Aim for the Heavens! Neon Genesis Toppa Mobile Suit Gundambuster! 

(I threw in some Gunbuster, the only significant mecha you were missing) 




 What is this, Shadow the Hedgehog? 




 Victim = suffering from something undeserved + a lack of bias from me specifically.  




 They should go for the next level of inclusivity, like having ~~colored-only~~ poc-only areas like water fountains.  




 I don't even want to make fun of the guy. This pic is adorable.  




 But Tumblr still isn't a cult.  




 Bye.  




 The Republicans are the right-wingers who want the government to have less power, with more individual freedom. The Democrats are the other end of the spectrum, more government support, though there aren't as many individual freedoms. 

It's a bit more complex than that, but that's the best I can describe it at midnight on an anime forum.  




 Is this available in a higher quality? 




 You're right, I'm not entitled to free content. It sure is a good thing I paid for the whole game.  




 Mewtwo.  




 Arceus is also the only mentioned deity in Smash.  




 Just look at Yoko and her Tengen Toppa Titty Tank.  




 implying HOA isn't going to side with the Governator. 




 The first two (the good ones) had Sarah Connor. She was actually killed offscreen between 2 and 3.  




 Mickey is Glocal?! 




 No, Unit-01's in the engine.  




 History remembers him as a coward Mickey!

 He tries to time it just right so he can get off the subway right as the door closes.  




 I really, *really* need that to have a Western release. If it does I think I'll have enough Evangelion content to justify giving it its own shelf.  




 The 3-in-1 packs aren't hard to find, I got mine at Barnes and Noble. Volumes 13 and 14 are only standalone so far. If you look on eBay, you can find some stuff relatively cheap.  




 You think the darkness is your ally? 




 It helps if the girl in question happens to be genetically similar to Yui Ikari.  




 My guess is an abnormally large varia/gravity suit. With an optional baby metroid helmet.

 I'm beefing over pie.  




 "You're adopted?" 




 It's not easy being meguca 




 Has MadoSaya gone too far? 




 I've been hoping. My thought is that they should release volumes 12-14 as an "End of Evangelion" compilation, even though 12 is already in the gray one.  




 No, all 12 men on the Moon to date have been American.  




 My favorites are actually a tie between Unit-01 and the Mass Production Units

Unit 01 just has an amazing design. I also love how badass she is when Shinji isn't in charge. 

The MP-Evas are really unnerving (or unNERVing i guess) since they look so... biological in their movements, despite the fact that they still give off the outward appearance of the robots. The other Evas don't do that. That and they have fuckin' sword-lances.  




 The DVDs, the Manga, and one soundtrack CD (Death)

I haven't seen any chance to grab any of the art books yet. Yet.  









 Weird. I haven't seen many go for that cheap.  




 [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byronic_hero)

Taking into account the character development we'd seen throughout the first series, and even some of the second and Final Wars, I thought Goji has all the traits required of a Byronic Hero. My English teacher disagrees and I disagree back. What do you guys think? 




 There was a period with collegehumor where they did censor some swear words, and judging from the TruTV shows I've seen they're going to be around that level of vulgarity. So I'm not really worried. 




 platinum thin is probably the best release (so far) of NGE, and EoE really hasn't had any great releases yet. The US copies of EoE are $100+, so unless you want to spend that much you should buy one from the UK, where the movie is really cheap for some reason.  




 This isn't cringe. This is good.  




 It honestly makes as much sense to me to ship her with Sub-Zero if we just stick her with any fool with ice powers. Jack and Elsa just don't seem like a good match. 

ninja edit: I just found [this](http://uekiodiny.deviantart.com/art/Sub-Zero-Elsa-and-Jack-ah-O-O-454801167) after a quick bit of googling. *it's perfect* 




 1) the first two angels had been around for a couple billion years, as they were the Seeds of Life that originally crashed to Earth. Second Impact took place in 2000, and scattered young, larval Angels all across the world to ultimately find their way to Tokyo-3. 

2) That's where they thought Adam, their father, was. They wanted to get back to him to be the vessel of the Third Impact. It was actually Lilith, they just figured that there couldn't be another AT Field as strong as their Seed of Life. 

3) they had different motives and scenarios for third impact. Gendo wanted to use it to see Yui again, while SEELE wanted to create a God out of humanity. 

4) Actually Adam (Unit-01 being the exception), but other than that you're spot-on. 

5) S2 engine. It's an organ that allows Angels to be perfect, self-sufficient, godlike life forms. It allows for them to pull from limitless power by harnessing the AT Field. This is why the Angels are just about immortal except for the core, which is the S2 engine. 

6) To make a very long story short, the Lance was packaged with both seeds of life. It was basically an emergency shutdown device for seeds of life so two didn't end up on the same planet. The Lance we see in the series was Adam's, which he used on himself during the First Impact after Lilith lost hers. 

7) She's a clone of Shinji's mother, Yui, with added Lilith DNA (I think). She also houses the soul of Lilith (except Rei II, who holds only a part, the other belonging to Unit-00) 




 aww... 




 but Sexism= prejudice + not being me so WZXMXN CANT BE SEXIST!!! 




 Police should all have to show if they have bad taste in anime 




 It doesn't look like it's the title of the promotion, since it's only on the Evangelion side of the "Schick X Evangelion" thing, so is it the new subtitle for 3.0+1.0? Or is it the retroactive subtitle to Neon Genesis thanks to the new BD/DVD?  




 Why include Portal in a Playstation commercial when that game is known for its PC version? 




 I hope she's okay with Mothra being the #1 mom.   




 From what I understand of your question, you *have* seen the series and want to buy it, correct? If not, all of these are in the order you should watch them (except Death and Rebirth, it's a glorified recap episode)

There's nowhere to legally digitally download any of the series to my knowledge, so I'll break down the releases by series:

NEON GENESIS EVANGELION:

There's been a couple releases on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD. There's also an upcoming new DVD release and a Blu-Ray release which may or may not be coming to the West. The cheapest DVD box currently is ADV's "thin pack" Platinum Collection (you can find it on Amazon, but beware as there is a lot of bootlegging). This contains the whole series, plus the Director's Cut Episodes, in the highest available quality (until Blu Ray HD). It's the one I have. There's also another Platinum Collection, the "thick pack". Same contents, episodes 1-26/24'. But this one has many more bonus features, though the overall quality sufferers for it. 

TL;DR: If you want cheap(ish) but good image quality, Thin Platinum. If you can spend more and don't mind slightly lower image quality of it means more content, then the Thick Platinum. If you want both and want to try your luck, you can wait for the New DVD or Blu-Ray. 

DEATH AND REBIRTH

Don't even bother. It's getting included with End of Evangelion anyway. 

END OF EVANGELION

This had a couple DVD releases from Manga Entertainment and another company who I don't remember. It's expensive as FUCK for a U.S. copy of the DVD ($100+, MIN). If you have a multi-region DVD player (or a PC), just import an English copy from the UK. For whatever reason it's really cheap across the pond. This is also getting re-released on Blu-Ray, though no confirmation of a new DVD has come up. This brings us back to D+R. The Blu-Ray of NGE includes "Revival of Evangelion", which is the final cut of Death (the recap half of Death and Rebirth) cut together with the final cut of End of Evangelion. 

TL;DR: **GOD SAVE THE QUEEN**

Evangelion 1.11: You Are (Not) Alone

This one's been pretty easy to find, but there *is* some fuckery afoot. There also exists a release on DVD and Blu-Ray of Evangelion 1.01, which is just a non-remastered version of the same movie that came out, then they realized there was some work that needed to be done, hence 1.11. (1.0 is the theatrical version). In my experience, buying 1.11 is cheaper, plus it includes the old version in case you're a masochist. 

TL;DR make sure there's no zeroes

Evangelion 2.22: You Can (Not) Advance

This time there wasn't even a 2.02 release. Choose DVD or Blu Ray and give Anno your cash. 

Evangelion 3.33: You Can (Not) Redo

This one isn't out in the West yet. If you hate dubs with a passion, then you can import a DVD or Blu Ray from Japan, but if you want a dubbed release from Funimation we're still waiting on that shit. 

Sadamoto's manga

The official manga has four 3-volumes-in-one releases, plus standalone releases for volumes 13/14. Check Barnes and Noble, they should have something.  




 I have seen Hellsing Abridged and it didn't even occur to me that that was a reference. 




 I'm with you, DJ Hero was the shit. Especially since I got the thing where you could play as Daft Punk. But that's a fair point as well.  




 That might be the single most incorrect thing I've heard all week. It's so far from anything resembling the truth. She was an advocate for women's rights long before taking the bullet. The bullet is just what put her on the global map, especially since she kept doing what she was doing after getting shot for it.  




 2015

going to /r/AdviceAnimals for dank memes

fucking casual. true losers only go to /r/4ChanMeta for the freshest of maymays 




 It's a joke, though it looks like the original was unironic defening.  




 Allow me to play Devil's Advocate, as someone who watch intently the brutal death of the music game genre. 

~~It was a few years before the end of the last console generation. There was exactly one game that most people point to when they talk about the downfall of music games: DJ Hero. It was similar enough in concept to Guitar Hero, everyone was pretty excited for some fan-favorite techno influenced songs. But the controller... The controller is one of the most fucked up abominations to come out after the Power Glove. Even the Kinect laughs at the DJ Hero controller. This ruined the game, and made everyone realize what they were doing wasn't fun, it was just a glorified quicktime event-filled music player. This is when the entire market realized that music games really did make them look like tremendous twats who could just as easily be streaming the same songs on the internet for free. It was with that game that the genre died down to a couple releases a year, after both Rock Band and Guitar Hero kind of gave up.~~

So the defener could be interpreting an electronic-influenced song as harkening back to the death of the genre, the worst thing one can do when trying to revive the genre. 

Or he could just be a pretentious asshole, either one really. 

Edit: there's also the possibility that I'm a fuckin idiot who doesn't know what he's talking about.

 And the scale (albeit, the archaic version of the scale with the two plate things) is a symbol of justice.  




 Groovy.  




 So is You Can (Always) Be Free the official title for Evangelion 3.0+1.0? Because that looks like it's attributed to the Evangelion half of the logo, not being the title for the promotion.  




 I'll post a comment from the old thread so more people can see it:
