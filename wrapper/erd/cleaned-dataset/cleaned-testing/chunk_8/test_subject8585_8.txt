 Start with the name,  "Jamb"=jambon or ham, sausage, tasso but can be chicken, seafood etc.; "ala"= a la, with or everything; "Ya"=African for rice.  
Start with the holy trinity, add seasonings, protein of choice, rice, then tomatoes and stock. Cook until rice is al dente.  The dish is usually heavily seasoned depending on the protein.  It should be somewhat "wet" like a rice casserole so that it sticks together instead of "dry" like a rice pilaf.     









 While there's no hard and fast rule, Jambalayas usually have tomatoes, tomato sauce or both.  With the addition of black-eyed peas your dish looks more like a dressed up version of Hopping John's.  Not that that's a bad thing but it's not what I consider cajun Jambalaya to be.  Note: Spent 10 years cooking in New Orleans.  




 I'm sure you couldn't after some relative of yours cooked their ass off! 




 Are you trying to quit?
 




 Who won? 




 More to come! 









 Breakfast in Britain must hazz those beans! 




 I have more faith that the plates are clean then tableclothes that were stored in closets or on shelves even in 5 star restaurants.   Go ahead though and make money with this gimmick to naive diners.  The next best thing will be serving the meal directly on the floor (granite or cedar of course) for artistic affect with only pillows to prop the diners up.  Mark my words!    




 Thanks, it's been a long time since I've done it.  Maybe I'll take it up again. 




 I don't meet to many people that are truly in this.  I took up hand axe throwing and blowguns in '84. 




 Or freeze them if you don't use them right away. 




 Eating off of the table may appeal to the inner child but I find the growing practice disgusting.  Plates can be sanitized but tables can't be run through a 185F dishwasher.  Nasty! 




 Tommy?! 




 Foam, I get it, in small amounts but this looks like a rabid dog drooled all over an otherwise lovely looking dish. 




 What grocery store do you work in? 




 Heinz 75 beans, made famous by Ann Margaret! 




 Who in the world would buy 2 boiled and peeled eggs for $1.99? 




 Almost every dry goods in my panty has a woohoo discount sticker on it!  Grocery prices are just too damn high!  




 They're called Ralph's in CA 




 Jim Bowie, of Alamo fame, was a slave runner/owner. 




 Most people know this lol! 




 Faith, by definition, excludes reason. 




 Yes, that is correct. 




 Yea, sorry about the Americans ruining your pizza business and turning the dish into several successful corporate businesses.  "Excuse Me!"  said the enterprising Italian/Americans!     




 If science could prove evolution beyond a shadow of a doubt would you still believe Biblical teachings over what science shows as truth?
 




 Should be "super stringy cheese mac".  This is why I never put mozz in my mac and cheese.  On another note,  "free range chicken broth"?  Made me imagine bowls of chicken broth hopping around a soup coup. 




 I went to a grocery store in San Diego to purchase a money order.  When I got home I realized I had $100 too much and the clerk must have messed up the transaction so my husband and I went back and told the clerk.  He called his supervisor and they counted down the register but no discrepancies showed up.  We went on to shop in the store and as we were about to check out the clerk ran up to us and said they finally found the discrepancy and his manager had offered us 2 free deli sandwiches for the $$$.  I could have messed with this young man but I gave him the $100.00 back knowing that if I made a mistake like that it would have been a god-send for a customer to return a $100.00 mistake except that it wasn't a god-send since I'm an Atheist and have empathy for someone in that position.  




 Okay, this one I did all by myself.  At my first duty station I made some pie dough using the Armed Forces Recipe Cards.  It listed every ingredient on the front except for water.  I made what I thought looked like a perfect pie dough for 300 portions of Cobbler.  Refrigerated it before rolling it out, it then rolled out beautifully with no cracks and baked off to a perfect golden brown.  I didn't discover how important a little bit of water was until they tried to cut up the pie and the crust instantly turned to dust!   




 Oh please elaborate! 




 On a destroyer I was stationed on we had 4 five gallon buckets of used fryer oil stored on the deck in the galley that was all of about 150 sq ft.  We were expecting high-speed maneuvers that day and secured everything we possibly could however, no one thought to check that the lids were tight and the buckets could not move around.  All four buckets spilled at the same time.  Since this was a ship we first had to stop as much of the oil from going down the drain and scoop up as much oil as possible all the while the ship was still in maneuvers, left then right at angles of about 30 degrees.  This happened right after securing for lunch.  Took about four hours to finally clean up the mess and we still managed to prepare dinner in time.  Everyones fault because no one checked.  Wish someone had been able to make a video!

 Yes, it was a version that a young couple brought to Austin in 1972 to people that never heard of a muffuletta.  The big difference is the bread and olive tapenade. 

I worked at a Schlotsky's in Jr High School in 1981 when it was all about the sandwich.  The bread was delivered in the mornings fully baked so the recipe was kept secret.  
Schlotsky's bread is what sets it apart from a Muff. and I should know since I lived there for nine years.  Muffs use a round Italian.  Schlotz uses a recipe that combines a Sourdough starter with a  English muffin type bread and they are very protective of the recipe! 




 Seriously, don't repost from Yahoo food ever again. 




 A thing of gastronemic beauty created you have. 




 Just puttin' it out there.  A lot of people are put off when they find out their sushi chef is Mexican/Latino.  They think it's because they'll work for less $$$ but they're wrong.  Gotta support my peeps!
   




 Reminds me too much of my food and wine pairing class, sans the wine. 




 This has to be in Texas! 




  There's a historical explanation for this.  The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 effectively stopped all immigration from China to the US and many Chinese who were already here were not allowed to return if they left the US who still had family here.  
 This caused many Chinese to immigrate to Mexico where many opened restaurants or became street vendors.  In the meantime, the Chinese practically invented human smuggling to the US.  
 Consequently the Mexicans, particularly along the border have developed a particularly refined palate for Chinese/Asian food.  Most of the best Chinese/Japanese restaurants in Texas employ a Chef Martinez or Chef Rodriquez as head chef.   




 If you've been scarred by this thread then you are what we'd call a pansy, pussy,  




 Her nails,  I have felt your pain!  What gyno  patient wants to have a pelvic exam with a doctor that has 1 inch nails.   




 You can plan but sometimes things come up that you have absolutely no control over.  For instance a piss test in the military while you're heavily menstruating.  You can't say no and you have to pee into a cup and if you use a pad instead of tampons then you try to pee without any blood getting into the sample because you have to hold your sample over your shoulder in front of every other person until you submit it.     




 Not being taken seriously by doctors who will tell you your problem is "all in your head". 




 The credibility and sanction of Catholicism and the Pope and the special status that no other religion is privileged to under the UN,  despite the fact that B. Mussolini granted the Vatican it's special status. 




 If he cut out the unnecessary theatrics he'd be a lot quicker but then that is what the customers want. 




 I say this to my cat over and over when he purposely walks in front of me to slow me down and give him what he wants!
 




 you're at the grocery store and the butcher asks how many crabs you need and you respond, "6 all day".    




 I've never understood a snood or paper hats for that matter.  Facial and body hair, be it from a beard (long or short), neck, eyebrows, eyelashes or the forearms all shed at the same rate.  To be completely safe from hair you'd have to wear a net completely over the head and gloves up to the elbows! 




 Try putting the oatmeal (steal cut) plus all other ingredients and seasonings you want in a crock pot overnight on low.  You'll wake up to a lovely aroma and a sweet treat!  




 I like the concept.  Think I'll try one with crab, bacon and avocado with a shmear of mayo on homemade bread. 




 This looks great but crosses the bounds into the realm of casserole instead of mac   cheese.    




 No, it's Rudy's.  I plan to get to Heim's as early as possible.  Can't wait to try their pork belly burnt ends!  




 I would almost commit a crime to get a meal of "free" prison food that looked like that! 




 You can also just use a thick-cut raw onion ring or bell pepper. 




 I concur.  Also the perfect ratio of mush and herb to pastry.  Well done my friend! 




 All of the people in this picture appear to be happy.  "nough said".  What is interesting is which ones are deemed, "gross, disgusting or doable" in the comments.  The old skinny lady, the overweight younger lady or the overweight middle-aged man.  Keep the comments coming as this will make a great essay after I pull the data!
    




 I bought it from a local baker.  Here's his facebook page.

 Thankfully this didn't happen on the actual bridge of the Huey P Long.  It's one scarry frickin' bridge.  Two narrow lanes of traffic on each side with an elevated train trussel between them.

 Dr Higgins lived there and taught Eliza Dolittle ow to talk.  




 She should have saluted.  Nuff said. 




 Billy Graham no more represents the American mainstream than Hee Haw.     




 Is their faith so weak that they feel that a government must prop it up?  What denomination will this theocracy adhere to?  

The middle east has fought between two major factions of Islam for 1400 years so that one can rule.  I can't imagine how the US could pick and stick with one denomination.    




 No because Jesus! 




 It doesn't work for every pest but it did make a difference in my garden last year from the one before. 




 Plant Marigolds at various intervals in your garden.  They emit a natural repellant for a variety of bugs. 




 This may explain why so many Chinese/Japanese restaurants have Latino chefs here in Texas. 




 k 




 What if the man said "Asians can't cook".  If you were of Oriental descent wouldn't you be pissed?  I see no difference between a judgement made about genitals or physical characteristics (race is an illusion in and of itself unless your a victim of it).   




 You'll do fine.  Stay grounded in reality but keep your aspirations in the sky! 




 I did my Externship with what I thought was a place that could teach me the in's and out's of running a restaurant.  Turns out they rely on accountants even though the so-called owner has a business degree from TCU.  He never gave any direct instruction.  He's basically a political drone in training  




 3 extra plates = a 50 cent per extra plate charge. 




 When guys say that what they really mean is they believe women can't handle the pressure of being a professional in the industry.
  
To them their mother probably made the best whatever.  With a few exceptions, no one could make it like she could.  Mom was always depicted at being able to cook the perfect Thanksgiving turkey with all the sides plus desserts for 20 family members and look good while doing it in heals! Plus FOH duties which included the table settings and seasonal decor.  Women were perfectly suited to cook in the home for family and manage organizational stress but never in the Big Ole' Capitalist Marketplace.

We're just delicate flowers that need squashi....'er protection.  News Flash...--.--..Women are as capable as men in working under pressure either in Food Service or as US Navy Combat fighters.

 It's a perception thing that screws women out of a fair wage.  Women can be wonderful cooks and great organizers but not when it comes to being a professional because only men are perceived that can do that. 




 Hope she turned out okay.  Sad what you have to do when you're desperate. 




 Soooo did you? 




 LOL!  "Croque Messier"  I thought the only way you could make a Croque Monsieur more messy was to add an egg. 




 Hey now!  As a Scot-Irish that loves to drink but doesn't want to pay for it I proudly resemble that remark! 




 Reminds me of Sheldon asking Penny (Big Bang) how they make a half sandwich.  
"Where exactly does the half come from? Are you giving me half of someone elses sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else to order the other half?..........You can't make a half of a sandwich, a half of a whole sandwich is just a small sandwich!"
giggle;) 




 Banana for scale please. 




 I could buy 4 McDoubles a day for a week which = $4.76x7=$22.67.  Plus a bag of 5 lb potatoes at .69 per lb = $3.45 and vegetable oil for frying.  Cumulative total = $26.12. 

Most poor people live in areas that have no accessible to grocers that have fresh fruits and vegetables.  I want to give them  access.  I'm serious!  A Fresh Food Truck!    









 Well done!  I wanted to ask for some of my money back in tuition when my chef/instructor admonished me in front of a guest that a small tasting plate I presented as a Croque Monsieur with a wine pairing was actually a Croque Madame (because it was smaller) even though there was no fried/poached egg!  Now you need to make a Hot Kentucky Brown! 




 You must really like tater salad to show it front and center in this pic!  Where is this from?  




 I know, right?  Dad used to like his Scotch on the rocks but whiskey has to be neat. 














 Use Sevin dust. 




 NM=Needless Markup 




 It's navy wide jargon.  Many kitchens use the term also. 




 OMG, Billy Joel!  You're killing me! 




 My mother's divorce from her second husband.  All of a sudden it was Mom, myself and my little brother.  I was 12 and I became  responsible for my 9 year old brother after school.  I also had do start dinner and do the laundry and whatever cleaning needed to be done before my Mom came home or else we were berated or worse, simply ignored. 









 Exactly,  If Jesus was God then he can't be killed.  Only changed back into his original form which was not a sacrifice for God and himself.  Considering the amount of suffering and death of ordinary humans, Jesus ranks really low. 




 While I like the passage you refer to it does not reflect a true sacrifice.  Much like the Peter Pan story, everyone must give up their childhood in order to become an adult.  What Jesus was saying here was not to love your earthly existence but to instead look forward to an everlasting life with God.  If that is the case then there was no sacrifice since the inevitable outcome was to become something greater.  A true sacrifice means a loss without compensation and that never happened with the Crucifixion of Jesus.  




 I was an Admiral's cook at a Flag Mess.  Worked many parties at his quarters.  When the parties started to wind down his wife, who herself held a high level civilian position in DC,  would come back into the kitchen, tell me to grab a "drink" and we would go out back to talk, smoke and commiserate.  She hated most of the O wives.  Most down to earth woman I've ever met.   




 Mmmmm, fat charred with mustard!
 




 I don't know if I would call his style endearing but Stephen Jay Gould wrote many essays and books that touched on complex topics but wrote in such a way that the everyday person could understand.   His style and even title's were enough to to draw you in.  See "Male nipples and clitorial ripples".

 Cabbage wedges, carrots and Dutch baby yellow potatoes were oven roasted with a mixture of 6 Tbls butter, 1 cup minced scallions, 2/3 cup creamed horseradish, salt and pepper.  

Corned beef cooked as usual with spice packet+2 tsp black peppercorns and 6 whole clove.  

Glazed with Jezebel Sauce:  1 cup orange marmalade, 2/3 cup apple jelly, 1/4 cup creamed horseradish, 5 Tbls Creole mustard and 1 tsp course ground black pepper.  Makes about 2 cups.  Leftover sauce is great with pork chops or ham or spooned over slightly melted cream cheese as a dip.   














 I used to clean out clogged drains with baking soda and vinegar.  Pretty much worked like a charm.
 














 This would not go well with a beer. 




 Whataburger, Braums, and Jack-in-the-Box.
 




 I guess reposting stuff that others posted from Pinckerest makes the front page.  Shame on you OP! 




 Unless you're actually eating them in Texas because that makes them better ; ) 




 Maybe you ate it and don't remember lol!
