 That would be true if it weren't for the Bible...

Acts 16:30-31 - He then brought them out and asked, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? They replied, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved."

John 3:3 - Jesus replied, Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again. 




 I second this question. I think that I would really enjoy co-op missions, but I've never been able to play one. 




 I haven't gotten Uplay to work without crashing on my PC. Did you have to mess with anything to get it to work properly? 




 Is this a good deal for [GTX970](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814487076)? Can't decide whether I should get it from Amazon and free 2-day shipping OR through Newegg and get a free Far Cry 4. 




 I want to buy a graphics card within the next ten minutes, spend less than $300, get a great deal for card quality, and run it from a 550W supply. Suggestions? Links?

 You mentioned the 280X. Is a 290 out of the question? I've found a few for good prices, but it seems like they run really hot and I'm having trouble finding ones that work with a 550W supply. 




 That's what I keep hearing. It might physically hurt my frugal soul to go over $300, but if I have to... 




 Can someone please help me? I'd like to spend under $300, if possible, to get the best graphics card for my setup.

 I read the title as "Young *frat* boy". Came expecting something different. Left with similar results. 




 I NEED HELP! Why can no one respond and help me pick an appropriate graphic card!?!? 




 I've really been looking into the 290's. I'm just nervous they get way too hot.

This [**GIGABYTE**](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125505 nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-na cm_sp= AID=10446076 PID=3938566 SID=) looks like a good deal but not the best reviews.

This **[XFX](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150701)** looks killer, but I don't think my power supply can support it. 




 Edited OP with applicable data. Thanks. 




 [Intel Core i5-2500K 3.3GHz Quad-Core Processor](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80623i52500k) 




 Will the 290 fit my requirements as stated in the OP? 




 I keep getting drawn back to the **AMD Radeon R9 290**. Not sure if it will fulfill my desires though. 




 A response that we all wish we could give to the higher ups at Ubisoft. Well done. 




 What a beautiful gift to give your daughter when she is grown. 




 I know that I'm ignorant, but what does this mean for the casual viewer? What difference will I be able to recognize in videos that are 60fps? 




 Can we come? 




 My wife and I have done a lot of the "common" stuff. I need some ideas for a very special and unique date to celebrate her upcoming birthday. Ideas? 




 This is a great comment! Completely unexpected critique, but then again, I'm here on MFA so I should have expected it!

I think she was going for [this Doc](http://i.imgur.com/PFrcbgw.jpg) by the way.

^^^P.S. ^^^It ^^^wasn't ^^^cosplay. ^^^It ^^^was ^^^just ^^^for ^^^fun. ^^^Instead ^^^of ^^^a ^^^sexy ^^^nurse ^^^she ^^^thought ^^^it'd ^^^be ^^^much ^^^more ^^^fun ^^^and ^^^antithetical ^^^to ^^^be ^^^someone ^^^as ^^^crazy ^^^as ^^^Doc. 




 My wife and I went as Doc and McFly last Halloween. I think it turned out pretty decent: http://i.imgur.com/ibGVCrT.jpg

 Hey this is very nice of you to share with us. Thank you for the work and translations! 









 About how much should it cost to get her/him fixed? Any idea? 




 Ozma sure digs a lot. I need to take a picture of the privates one more time to confirm.  




 Follow-up question: Does it matter? Besides their genitals, do male bunnies operate and function any differently than female ones? 




 **Link to previous post:** http://redd.it/2hal16 









 SHE won't let me flip HER over. She panics and kicks me in the chest (like I imagine a woman typically would). You're making my breathing shallow, man... 




 We've had this *girl* for almost a year now. We named her a girl name and have treated her as our very own daughter! She is a precious princess in our family and I need to know right now that we have been correct in our early analysis that she is indeed a girl.

She laid down this evening and this pink thing was flaring out between her legs. Please tell me that is in no way a penis or testicles. It really needs to be labia, people. 

Please, for the love of all that is holy, tell me that my daughter is indeed a daughter.

**EDIT:** I'm pretty sure all of you are right. She is a he. I need some sleep. I can't. I will take another picture tomorrow and come here with the evidence.  









 I did look. For some reason I didn't see it. Thanks for bringing it to my attention. 




 Those are great speakers for the price. Logitech puts out quality sound gear. 

I've got [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027VT6V4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8 psc=1) from Logitech right now and they are spectacular. Plus, they are just a few more dollars. 




 In need of some facial lotion made for oily skin. Any ideas that won't break the bank? 




 GPU suggestions? 




 Any GPU suggestions that would work with my current set up?  




 *Cross-posted. Wanting some more input.* 

I built a PC back in 2012 with some decent parts at the time. The computer still works fine, but I want to be proactive in updating my PC before it becomes a problem. I've listed my current specs below.

Can you help me figure out what I need to prioritize in this upgrading process (assuming that I cannot afford every upgrade at once)? Which current pieces need to be replaced soonest? What should they be replaced with? Etc.

(Not wanting to spend absurd amounts of money for the upgrades. Under $500 or so total. PC used mainly for gaming and browsing.)

 Love the idea of getting an SSD to transfer my OS to. Have that setup on my laptop and it loads up so incredibly fast. 

How difficult is it to transfer an OS that is already in regular operation though?  




 Hello friends. I am new to this sub and have enjoyed watching all of you masterminds at work over the past few weeks.

**What will you be doing with this PC?**

* My wife and I regularly game together. We want to be able to continue playing the best story-driven action games (Bioshock Infinite, Assassin Creeds, Tomb Raider, The Walking Dead, Paper's Please (lol). It is also used day-to-day for web browsing and paper writing.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* I am a conservative spender. I'm looking biggest bang for my buck and I'm buying piece by piece. Any and all upgrades would need to total less than $500. Can be flexible.

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC?** 

* By the end of the year I would like to have a few pieces replaced for longer durability and better quality. 




 What's vat? 




 Thank you. Had no idea.
