 I'm a rabble rouser. I rouse rabbles.  




 Can you provide some examples? I'm not challenging you this is just the kind of thing I want to talk about, and need to know about. 




 I didn't know where precisely to put this, sorry if it doesn't necessarily belong here.  




 I have been following everything and I mostly agree with you, though I don't think our generation would ever allow a draft, and I only think 1/2 of our current wars are illegal.  









 The only thing you can do is be there for him when he asks, and maintain cautious distance when he doesn't.  The loss of someone that close that suddenly can awaken some dormant things inside of a person. I used to be suicidal so if you ever need advice, message me and I can let you know some signs to watch out for. Stay strong, for you and for him.  




 HEY EVERYONE! OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS SAME IDEA SO IT'S NO LONGER FUNNY! JOKES ARE ONLY FUNNY WHEN DONE ONE TIME AND ONE TIME ONLY! I'M DOING YOU ALL A FAVOR HERE BY POINTING OUT THAT THIS GUY IS DOING A JOKE THAT ISN"T COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY ORIGINAL.

Yes I know it's not been done before just once, it's done a lot but who gives a fuck. I still laughed. If you didn't ok, move on with your life and stop being a dick about it.   




 Cops, Nickleback, and (to a certain extent) Religion. 




 See that's funny. I still just can't get into it. I think I'm missing the seinfeld gene.  




 Well I mean if you're gonna be in the greater Jacksonville area in the next few weeks....


Edit: Unintentional Creepiness aside, i definitely understand, and I'm not saying wait for that perfect moment with fireworks and white wine and all that Hollywood nonsense, just best not to rush into anything you'll later regret. I've had some close calls where I damn near broke rule #1, and it would have been bad.  




 I'm 23 and still a virgin, I feel you. It'll happen when it's supposed to though. I know more people who regret their first times because they rushed it instead of waiting. 




 Some moments of brilliance and then some moments of... not at all. 




 I mean I get it. I have friends who are crazy about it and that's cool, just not my thing personally. 




 Getting this second hand because Elder Scrolls isn't really my things, but it comes from a random NPC encounter that the hive mind exploded over. 




 Frankly your careers been disappointing since Hustle and Flow anyway. 




 Tv: Not really any stand out new shows that I've seen, which is somewhat ironic given the thread. 

Games: Uncharted 3, Skyrim, Gears of War 3, Assasins Creed Revelations

Movies: Harry Potter 7.2, The Hangove 2, X-men First Class, Super 8, Captain America, Rise of the PLanet of the apes, Tucker and Dale Vs Evil, Warrior, Moneyball, Red State, 50/50, The Muppets.

That's what I got. God Bless for what you did over there. 

Anybody else? 




 I honestly recommend going back through it as soon as you're done with you're first viewing. You catch so much more the second time through.  




 That Sucks man, sorry. Can't say Skyrim does a lot for me but I know how freaked I'd be if that happens in march and I miss Mass Effect 3 




 Nice, some good things to come. Also the last season.  




 On the second season, having trouble finding time for it but I do love the show. 




 I've spent the majority of the last three weeks blasting my way through How I met your mother, Parks and Recreation, and starting community. I saw an episode or two of these at the beginning but just never really got into them.

So reddit, what are some of the things that you missed out on when they first started? 




 Collapsing ever inward

 Still a lot of life left.... 




 Just because we stop putting out milk and cookies, doesn't mean we can't still hope. 




 I still can't make myself do that. I'm 23 btw... 




 Again I said ridiculous, you're very handsome. 




 Oh emotional scarring... 




 Think it was a holdover from their parent. Lack of socks? I don't know. 




 Holy crap I thought I was the only one who got told this. 




 She is, she's also ocd. Vengeance is had. Frequently. 




 Right until my roomates start playing the fucking jaws music when I'm having my morning still mostly asleep poorivate time.  




 Read a couple of my previous posts, no... not even a little.  




 I said ridiculous.  




 Got that beat with two words, toilet sharks. 




 Upvote for me not having anything to say... 




 Well the 2nd one is true in the literal sense... 




 This one's a big one for me... Still holding on right there with you. 




 Go on... 




 This is just a question out of curiosity/for fun. Please, please, please, I don't care what spiritual beliefs you do or do not subscribe to, please don't attack anyone else. Just a bit of fun.  




 Bitches love pregnant 




 When she stabbed me in my shoulder and then made me apologize. That was a pretty good indicator.
