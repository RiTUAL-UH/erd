 I know! It was so good!  




 I'll definitely go and check out the rewatch threads - I've been dying to see what other people have thought after rewatching SSY...it's definitely a different experience the second time around. On Yakomaru/Squealer, I've actually started a thread dedicated to discussing him as a character, as he's personally one of my favourites. You should definitely [check it out!](http://www.reddit.com/r/shinsekaiyori/comments/3atzyy/the_nature_of_squealeryakomaru/) 




 I mostly agree with what you're saying about the possibility of Squealer becoming a dictator himself had he managed to overthrow the humans. What's really scary about that though is coupled with the revelation that bakenezumi were genetically engineered from the non-PK humans, it really does seem plausible that Squealer would become just like the humans he was trying to overthrow. I definitely agree that Squealer wasn't good. I mean, even if someone argued that he was inciting war for the sake of liberating his species, the fact that it seemed he was planning to go further than that and straight to world domination stands. In the end, his opportunistic and calculating nature definitely make it seem like he was after more than just being free from humans.  




 That sounds like exactly what I'm looking for! I'll give it a go :)
