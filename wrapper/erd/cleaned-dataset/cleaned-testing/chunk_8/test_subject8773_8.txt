 Yeah, I'm not worried about the mail, I know she'll hand that over. I'm just worried she wont give me the tax information. I'm pretty scared at this point but hopefully it will all work itself out. :/ 




 Haha oh man! Gosh darn Vikings. 




 Hi! Thanks so much :) 




 Thanks! 




 Thank you! I can't afford to take any prep courses, so I'm saving up for some LSAT books that are highly regarded online. Preparing on my own makes me a little nervous because sometimes I hardly have motivation to do everything else that's going on, but, I think it'll be fine! 




 That's so exciting! It seems so far off in my future but its really not. I have to take the LSAT this coming summer. It seems totally unreal 




 Well, I live in Green Bay WI. This is really stereotypical, but gamedays during football season are absolutely amazing, especially if you're actually going to the games or just tailgating anywhere near Lambeau. Everyone is so nice. It's like having a huge family who you can drink with and party with and love the Packers with. It is a totally unreal experience and it was amazing to grow up here, and I'm not even that into sports, really!

Football is our religion here. It's not an exaggeration what you hear about the cheeseheads haha. Everyone takes their prom pictures at the stadium, a fancy night out is taking a loved one to one of the stadium restaurants, or a restaurant named after someone associated with the Packers...yeah. Everyone should visit Green Bay on a game day sometime haha 




 This is such a great idea! 




 Actually, I'm still a junior in undergrad. I am pre-law track. Wonderful professor, very dry material. lol 




 As a citizen of Panem, I swear loyalty to President Akeleie. 




 AGREED.  




 Aww thank you so much! 




 Thanks! I'm pretty sure the last book I read was for one of my Con Law classes, pretty boring! haha 




 Thank you!
 




 Thank you! I generally like to think that if someone needs help and I am able to offer some, I will. I think that's a pretty neat trait to have! 




 I'm Maya! Nice to meet you as well! I dont think I ever go without pepperoni on a pizza. 




 Oh my gosh macaroni and cheese. I have to go make some now. haha 




 Thank you! 




 My favorite food by far is lasagna! Unless you count pizza as food, then pizza is my favorite. How about yours? 




 I just discovered this sub recently and I think what you do is pretty great! It makes me happy to see all the gift posts when I'm scrolling through reddit. :) Keep up the good work, all! 




 Mind-boggling, lol. And i know. WHITE SOCKS FOR KIDS ONLY. I can't even keep track of my own when they are fancy-patterned. 




 Red-pillers. 




 Aw that is so cute! I'm so jealous, mine just went away back to school for a J-term class! 




 American here. I'm from Wisconsin. Our overweight, entitled drunk girls are pretty terrifying 




 A sock basket. I soon realized that normal families just match their socks and get on with their lives.

 




 This sounds weird, but force yourself to smile and laugh with other people. Even if you feel dead inside, eventually it becomes genuine, and if you are looking for things to laugh at, eventually you realize there are a lot of things in the world that can make you smile. I use this a lot for my depression, and it helps with other situations too. 




 An "us" night, complete with food, movies, and lots and lots of sex and laughing. We have a fairly big group of friends who are constantly doing things and hanging out, and it's especially bad when everyone hasn't seen each other in a while. He's a good guy and hates saying no to people, so I feel like I have to compete to get his undivided attention sometimes. 




 Congratulations! That has got to feel so good. Sending internet fuzzies your way. Sounds like you've got quite the set-up, at the beach! Nice! 




 Aw, thank you so much! :) That means a lot to me.
