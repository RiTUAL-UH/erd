 Yes because every black male is approached like that by the police..gtfoh 




 And I am no psychologist, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn last night 




 It's not that they don't fight back.. Most of these videos are propaganda videos to help support their specific faction, so having a video of someone struggling and fighting back doesn't really give the whole "we submit" kind of feel that these videos tend to have.. 




 Thank you so much for answering my questions. I am going on as a sound tech. 

My one question to you is, did you enjoy your experience working for RC as a sound tech? 




 Amen 




 All I could really think about was that I didn't want to die on the floor and that it was cold down there. I didn't want to die in the cold 




 Thanks will do 




 Half pound for $450... I live in northern Cali and have never heard of a deal like that.. 




 When you think about things like this happening to you, you always think you would save the day and knock the gun out of his hands, blah blah blah. Bt that shit went out the window real quick and I just stayed on the ground hoping it would be over quickly  




 I am leaving on a 6mo contract next month with Royal Caribbean as an audio tech/stage hand and I still have some questions but the company is being quite vague with me. Here are some questions I have and feel free to let me know how your overall experience was as well! Thanks!
My 5 Questions:

I am a drummer and would not enjoy not being able to play for 6mo. Is there a staff lounge with say a piano and drum kit you can play?

How easy is it really to change rooms if you don't get along with your roommate?

How are the hours of work? I have heard many different things, anywhere from 12+hrs all week to some days are 12hr days and some are 2hr days.

Can you fast track yourself to a higher up position during your first contract? Can you do it at all?

Are you allowed off the ship when in port if there is no work to be had?

Thanks everyone! I look forward to some responses! It will help me out greatly :)

 Exactly man 




 It's hard for me to call it a good thing. Would I have rather it didn't happen, yes. But am I glad now that it did.. It's hard to say.. I'm justthankful I was able to take something positive away from such a shitty experience... And didn't get shot 




 He got away with around $450 so I'll let you make that call 




 No they have not yet, no real leads I know of either 




 I honestly don't know if me having a gun would have made the situation better or worse. Trying to go for a gun when one is already drawn on you, unless you're a quick draw, I feel like it would do more harm than good.

I do not own a gun, have never fired a gun nor do I plan to purchase one for my own safety.. I don't feel like I live in an unsafe area even tho this happened to me. The police said it was the first armed robbery in over 10yrs to happen in the town so a freak incident. Altho I have been toying around with the idea of hunting for the last year or so..

After the robbery I was very hesitant to go back to work and my bosses actually wanted me to close the bar the very next day and I literally had to plea with then to give me the night off and they reluctantly did because I think they knew I would have just quit. I was able to talk to a counselor and therapist a couple times that the victims unit of my police department provided. I was having a hard time wrapping my head around the whole ordeal and why it had to happen to me and to a degree still am but I have kind of come to grips with the fact that it was a sign to start making moves in my life and have started to do just that. And yes, I still close the bar at night but am much more cautious and nervous when doing so, but I put my two weeks in tonight so not too much longer  




 My life did not flash before my eyes, however I truly think it happened for a reason because I am not doing what I am suppose to be doing with my life. So I actually got a new and much better job that I could consider a career and put my two weeks in tonight. So it definitely gave me a life kick in the ass. 

 He had hosiery or tights over his face so I could not really see his face bt I saw what he was wearing and could recognize the voice again if I ever heard it.. Something I doubt I will ever forget 




 Fuck man, ya sweet vengeance would be very very nice.. After our robbery there was a robbery in a near by city and then another in south Lake Tahoe, all robbed in a similar way as we were. I am really hoping the police can find him with the evidence they collected at the other robberies and then maybe get the chance to see him in court and help put him away..  That's really what I want  




 I cant say having a firearm on me would have made the situation any better but I don't know if it would have made it worse either. Can't say I feel like a victim for not having a firearm tho. But I do understand why you would say that.  




  I was about 90% sure I was going to die that night. He could have done it so easily and my co worker didn't give him all the money (although the robber didn't know that) bt if he did that would have been all the reason he needed to do me in. When I think back about it, there are so many things I wish I would have done, but in the moment there was no chance I would have actually done it. But it is interesting to look at the situation from a few different ways in my head. I will have to check out that book tho, sounds interesting to me, especially now  




 My coworker only gave him the money out of 1 of the 2 draws we have and he didn't get our deposit for the night so only about $450 




 No fear boner, would have hurt anyway bc I was face down on a tile floor haha.. I have never shot a gun and have mixed feeling on carrying a concealed weapon.. I am not some hippy liberal guy that thinks we should all hold hands bt at the same time I don't know if having a gun on me would have made the situation better or worse..bt having an open carry might have meant that he would have seen my gun and maybe not done what he did, but who knows  




 Thank you, and it was actually kind of hard to bring myself to go back.. I am not the kind of person who has things really bother me after the fact, bt this shook me up and I didn't really want to go back to work right away. My bosses actually wanted me to close the next night which floored me and I literally had to plea with them to let me take the night off. Reluctantly they gave me the night off but it was like twisting their arm which kind of soured me on the establishment even more. I will say I am way more cautious/nervous closing now, but actually I put my two weeks tonight and got a new job. It's just too much of an uneasy feeling at my current job 




 When he told me not to move, and had the gun to my temple, I told him I wasn't going anywhere. That was all I really said to him.. I didn't really think to say anything to him to be honest, I really just wanted the whole thing to be over so talking to him may have just kept him there longer. 




 At first when I saw him come from the back I thought it was a joke until he came right next to me and put the gun in my face and put his hand on my shoulder and pushed me to my knees and then down on my stomach and told me to stay there. What's funny tho is I have thought in the past if something like this was to happen to me, I would totally just knock the gun out of his hand and tackle the dude and blah blah blah but when it happened, none of those thoughts came into my head. The robber said if I moved, or saw the cops or didn't get all the money he was going to spray my head all over the floor and even though he got everything he came there for, I was about 90% sure I was going to die that night because he could have done it so easy.. And the only thing that was honestly going through my head was I didn't want to die and that it was very cold on the floor and not a place I wanted to die. 









 I decided to take a hike with my dog and reflect on what happened and I can honestly say it was one of the most satisfying hikes I have taken in a very very long time. The sun seemed to shine a little brighter too 









 I am a male and yes he barked orders at me to get on the ground bt at first I thought it was some sort of joke bt once the gun was in my face, I figured wasn't and at that point I told him to take it easy as I was getting on the ground and when he told me not to move as the gun was on my head I told him I wasn't going anywhere, so I guess we talked.. 




 Hahaha no, we think he was just passing thru town bc we are off a major highway.. At least that's what the cops think  




 Well the short of it is, I was closing up at the bar I work at in my little Mtn town I live in around 12am on a Friday. Guy came out the back, drew a gun on me and made me get to the floor while my co worker emptied the register.. All the while having the gun pressed to my temple as I lay on the ground.. Ask me anything, I can give more details and nothing is off limits.

 Well fuck.. 









 What they wrote, that's what we do 









 Be a better pet owner u twat 




 I believe you are correct. The large fishing vessel that the video was shot from was being attacked by the people in the water. They were pirates and the main ship was in the right to defend themselves the way they did, however, the high fives seen on film by the crew is a little unnecessary bt I get it I guess..   














 If I am correct, it is the artist [Panca](http://vimeo.com/70903001)from Tijuana.. That video is a segment I worked on for a tv program called Art pulse tv which has since been discontinued. 




 .......are you suggesting cage the elephant is a hardcore punk band!?
