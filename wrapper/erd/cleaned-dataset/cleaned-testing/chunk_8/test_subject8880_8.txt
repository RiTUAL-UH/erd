 You have any complete runs, omnibuses, absolute editions, Marvel Essentials,etc.? 




 OK, what the fuck you done now? 




 Cockblocking your brother from one night stands is just silly. 




 It's just a bunch of fat bitches wearing skinny clothes and fedoras. 




 A Roku. You will be watching metric fucktons of movies. 




 Lick it before you stick it. 




 Wishmaster. 




 So one Saturday morning a few years ago I was in my car driving to get breakfast. I had a headache that morning and decided to take some 
Headache Powder to get rid of the pain

OK, so I forgot the AC was on and the powder blows right into my face making it look like I was doing coke and when the powder hits my eyes I run off the road.As my eyes opened, I swerved to the left RIGHT IN FRONT OF A STATE TROOPER.
So, I missed him and he turns around. Little did I know I had a few empty beer bottles I had in a bag in the car and it smelled like I had a party in the passenger seat floor.
He turns his lights on and here I am driving down the road with powder on my face and empty beer bottles I was supposed to throw away. 
Luckily I explained, got my car searched and everything was ok. 




 Geocities, Yahoo Chat, IGN, TOTSE, Textfiles, Napster, AOL. 




 Pussy. 




 Was you expecting Shakespeare? 




 Pussy. 




 I'm sorry but Game Of Thrones. I like it but some people get fucking nuts over a tv show that was a book written years ago.
I know that I will cause some controversy, but the fans of the show ruined it for me. 




 Oh hai mark 




 That one-eyed Dog Daryl found in the church in Season 4 of the Walking Dead. The dog didn't get eaten by a zombie, he just ran away.
Imagine the adventures of a one eyed pirate dog in the zombie apocalypse. 




 I understood that reference. 




 Well, take out Frayser, Whitehaven and Orange Mound out of the equation and BAM no crime! 




 Kinda like Selmer,Tn. 




 But Denver has legal pot! 




 Was you expecting Shakespeare? 




 You need any early 80s X-Men for some them DC stuff? 




 Was you expecting Shakespeare? 




 Dr. Fedora. Leader of the M'Lads. 




 It's just an illusion. 




 Explain to me why DC hasn't put a Blue And Gold series but Prez gets a new book? 




 I read this as Milf vacation in Memphis and was like "my type of woman"  




 No Sandy Hook stories? 




 I understood that reference. 




 Try listening to the numbers stations in the middle of Antarctica. Spooky. 




 I remember this. What they do about the cops who done this? 
I think you may have some evidence on your hands. 




 Skeet skeet skeet 




 Oh no. Mass shooting I meant.

 A bag over her head can repair the damage. 




 I still have one..and they play burnt games because no region codes. 




 I would be a Willow Biter if she let me. 




 That's why you stuff her panties in her mouth during fuckhour. 




 I would bang her so hard she would be a Democrat after Im done. 




 Chris Brown gonna hit somebody! 




  Creepy? I don't remember it being creepy. 




 Young Nic Cage not older nutty Nic Cag. 




 Is that the old Memphis Comics And Records location? 




 Jenna Jameson? 




 Someone told me I look like Nic Cage but I have no idea. 




 I have at least 100 back issues of books dating back to the 50s. Various Marvel books including some Uncanny X-Men books that are bank (1st Dazzler, Dark Phoenix Saga,etc). I wanna sell these to a collector but so hard to find.
Craigslist is nothing but spam and I don't enjoy eBay because Paypal. Memphis who buys these comics in cash? HALP! 




 They're on eBay now. 




 They skip the creepy fedora and the arrogant attitude.

 Was she a Saigon whore? 




 That is fucking sick. 




 Share these books. 




 Would I were a nazi shirt around? Of course not, thats silly. Besides it's spelled "wear" not "were". 
I also own a bible. Does that make me a Christian? No. It's because I regard it as a form of history. Same as Mein Kampf. 
I love history. I love reading about it. I own many books about WWII and the Civil War. Does that make me a bad person because I fucking love history? 




 I own a copy of Mein Kampf. Does that make me a Nazi?
No. I just love history. 




 Is his fedora ok?

 Dude, your black not brown! She is just colorblind or her moma didnt teach her colors.

 Your comment and submitter history is a circlejerk of Bernie Sanders. How much are you getting paid? 




 Nope just trades,omnibuses and entire runs. Im a reader not a collector. 




 Was it too Extreme for you? 




 Oh fuck. How I remember when WMKW TV 30 in Memphis would show that on Sunday nights. 




 Give them to me. I would rather accept then and give them to my nephew than you throw them out.
Saves an asshole from finding them and selling them to an uneducated collector. 




 You're so Extreme it hurts. 




 Was you expecting Black Keys? 




 Around Memphis in West Tennessee.
THE SHIT PART OF TENNESSEE. 




 Saga? No, that's Elektra Saga. 




 Let's say you're wanna watch Aliens or something on Netflix that fateful day in April. You find the movie, click on it and BAM : oh Hai mark.
Best prank ever. 




 When he was a cast member of SNL 1980 he used his real voice.
I never even knew he was on SNL until Comedy Central aired reruns of that shit season. Same with Robert Downey Jr on SNL. 




 You're such an expert Mark. 




 Did a Hastings close down or something? They have the same back issue shelves. 




 This from the UK Transformers book? 




 Barry Allen returned in Final Crisis so it's pre-nu-52. 




 LET GO OF MY PURSE! I DON'T KNOW YOU! 




 That comment was coloring book material. 




 6 on Maximum Carnage TPB but Im shit out of luck because my Paypal BS. Wish you took money order. 




 I saw. I laughed. I want to move on that street. 




 'Murica has a president not a governor. 




 I once farted in front of a customer..then I was fired. 




 Ah the old 5 dollar Walmart bin flick by Lionsgate. 




 Ahh a mafia ran phone number lol 




 Capt. Atom. Too underpowered in mainstream DC.
He should be more Dr.Manhatten/Pre-Crisis Earth 4 Capt.Atom/Earth 75.45*67 Capt. Adam. 




 I actually prefer Byrne,Ordway,Jurgans, and Simonson Superman than the Nu-52 bullshit. 
I totally forgot Perez Action Comics run which I hold in the same regard. 




 If he was forgotten then why was he in the first few pages of Avengers/JLA? 




 President buying Magic The Gathering cards and Heroclix. 




 They are better than that Black Keys hipster shit. 




 [Holy shit. It's the real life Lockjaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockjaw_(comics)) 




 Yep. And I was a laughing 15 yr old kid and now I'm a 36 yr old laughing man. 




 DAE remember that infamous number from the 90's? 




 Should have said All Lives Matter. 




 They are first printings for the direct market. DC never reprinted Crisis until they collected it in 1996.  




 You mean 1996. 




 BatMecha. 




 Lacking in personality? Depends on the writer. The good writers see him as Conan the Barbarian with wings.
Just imagine a Blue Beetle type series like Starman. 




 I have a really weird Spawn-like feel to these photos.  




 Fuck Earth! 




  April Fools!

I once told a April Fools joke in September once.. 




 Rock hard. 




 I havent had my dick sucked in 4 years....ladies...? 




 Your best friend is a evil bastard. 




 Well, that was a rapey fucker right there.
I usually go about my biz...some men dont know the word ;stop". 




 "I'm sorry I fucked your mom."
 




 That I wish we was friends again because I miss her. 




 Did he live in a can? 




 I bet he lived a Semi-Charmed Life.
