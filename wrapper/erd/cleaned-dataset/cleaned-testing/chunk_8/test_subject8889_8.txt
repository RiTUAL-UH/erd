 yeah, my brother and I are 10 years and 5 months apart (I only mention the months bc for half the year it makes it seem like its 11 years difference), and our baby pictures are identical.  Based on photographs, we looked identical and grew at an identical rate based on our wall growth charts (mine is still on the wall; they're side by side).  It wasn't until about 8 or so that he started to differentiate more and grow at a faster rate than I did.
I'm a woman, btw.  My little brother looked pretty much identical to me at the same age throughout his younger childhood. 




 I sometimes hear my mom or dad say things when they're actually not even in that part of the house.  It freaks them out more than it does me, because they believe it means they're going to die or something, kind of like what you're saying. 




 good; I was going to link to the same 




 because you were a child and believed you could do it.  Now that capacity is blocked by the constraints you have learned since then.

yours is a very extreme case, but I firmly believe that we seriously limit our own mental capacity by accepting explanations of the world that are truly just theoretical and can't be concretely proven. 




 or it could have been a trap....

 maybe he's a ghost of a magician who didn't get recognition in life and just wants to put smiles on people's faces and make an impression 




 well reading minds in that sense (numbers and specific items of information that the person is actively thinking about) is not particularly difficult or uncommon.  

What you talk about reading people, as in picking up on emotions and stuff, it's just like a more practiced form of the same sort of sense.  I've freaked people out with it too.  However, this card guy was far better at it I'm sure.  His track record was probably so good/ he had such an easy time "reading" the cards from your minds, because he got plenty of practice by hanging around the college kids.  

Thanks for the idea for a skill-builder exercise.  That is much better than just asking a friend to think of a number. 




 your title made it sound like the building had disappeared :) 




 If my homework were based on my reddit,

I would already be done, and have extra-credit. 




 thanks for the tip! 




 We just made a google doc and were in a video call so we could talk verbally, and we just wrote it together.

you can work with people by writing a paragraph each, back and forth, like /r/passtheparagraph
or you can just talk it out and add things, or write until a logical stopping point/ you run out of ideas, and then let the other person take over.  
It's a nice thing to do when you're both bored 




 I am American as well.   




 I don't say it to people a whole lot, but this is one of my favorites:

"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?"
- Dumbledore in the Deathly Hallows.  




 I studied Criminal Justice in undergrad (working towards being an attorney), so I've heard plenty about the disturbing things inmates will do, especially those harboring the infections you mentioned and who feel they have nothing to lose.

However, those people do not make all of the inmates "human garbage". There are inmates who really are  "legit" "victims of circumstance".  

In the women's prison in my state, there is one lady in particular that we got to meet and speak to, who is serving a life sentence because, while she was asleep, her ex took her car to commit a murder and when he told her about it the next day, as he was already abusive, she was too afraid to come forward.  This makes her an accessory after the fact.  However, in my state, there is no legal distinction for "accessory".  All those involved in any way get charged with murder.  
They say she got life (the max) because the judge wanted to make an example of her, but that is neither here nor there.

If you want to argue about her being in an abusive relationship in the first place, people end up there by being too trusting and forgiving; that's the only fault that makes someone end up there, and you don't realize you're in that situation until it actually gets ugly, at which point, it is dangerous to try to leave.  People in those situations feel trapped, and if they don't have a support system to reach out to or a method to contact authorities without being stopped and beaten for it, then they kind of are trapped to an extent.

She is not garbage. 

The thousands of people serving life (or several decades) sentences for possession of marijuana are not garbage either.  Regardless of your views on marijuana, in moderate amounts it has been scientifically proven to be far less harmful than cigarettes or alcohol to say the least, and the extracts from it (cannabis oil) can stop seizures and help cancer patients (I can source this if you take issue with data).  People in the marijuana scene for the most part are not bad people.  At the very least, they are not garbage.

I would argue against calling any person garbage, but it would be acceptable for the nutcases who try to give people incurable diseases just for spite.

Anyhow, now that I'm done cross-examining your rant, the paranormal experience:

A vengeful spirit coming after their murderer is not too surprising from a psychological standpoint; given this person's history of an abusive personality, revenge surely fits the profile.  If she killed her abuser, it would most likely have been a self-defense situation or a crime of passion, meaning he could also either feel he has unfinished business in the beating she stopped him from delivering (trying to get in his twisted mind here (applying the Forensic Psychology I studied as well; not just pulling from the air)), or, if it was the latter, a crime of passion, then he may feel betrayed (from her being his to dominate) and thus feels the need to assert his dominance.

As cited above, it can be incredibly hard for someone to get away from an abuser though normal means.  If it came down to the last resort, killing them, and then you still weren't safe from them, that would be some kind of hell; she may feel like it was all for nothing and she'll never be free of him.  

It's interesting that you could see him though, before hand, but couldn't see him when he was behind your partner; same with how you saw a shadow in some cameras but only moving objects in others.  Maybe he wanted you to see him at those points.  The other possibility is that for some reason you were more receptive/perceptive of his presence at those points in time, possibly in relation to situational factors (lighting? presence of other people in the room?), or it could be in relation to physical actions taken by the poltergeist.  Maybe, since you said you didn't see the shadow when objects were moved, poltergeists are less visible when taking or preparing to take physical action.  That possibility just makes the fact that you couldn't see him behind your friend even scarier. 

Definitely want to try to get rid of a dangerous spirit like that, although it is not your problem, and he probably won't move on until she's dead, either because that's what he wants, or because he will torment her until the say of her natural death, as his revenge.  

Either way, you may see more of him until she is gone/moved or you are. 




 ha ha; the held back is probably partially going for a softer style and partially psychological from being in a dorm room!  

No, I have never had singing lessons, but I have been singing on my own my whole life really, and in my church's choir for a handful of years.  I have noted drastic improvements from when I first started recording (six years ago *shudders*) to now, but I know there's a lot more I can improve on.   

As far as the mic goes, yeah, I actually did three takes of this because I got too into it the first two times and got intimate with the mic, causing distortion; that may also be why I was holding back.

Anyway, thank you for pointing that out; it helped me realize I am still holding back sometimes in here, and that I still haven't found the sweet spot to sit from the mic in this new setup.

thanks for listening! 




 Nice work overall; I think, however, you could use more variety in the bass and tone down the treble.  You really only have a steady boom going for the bass.  You need to have the base move along with the chords of the main tune; this will give the track more life/depth.

I hope that is helpful! 




 excellent!  you had me tapping along within the first 30 seconds.  Only thing I can recommend is to maybe end with the same sounds from the beginning, so that it comes full circle, and ends maybe with one of those tones going up; just think it would be a nice touch. 




 very nice!  I am not familiar with the original, but I would recommend toning down the noise (by which I mean the fuzz/overblow) around the 1:20 and 2:00 marks for example, if possible.  It may be nicer on the ears with at least somewhat clearer tones. 




 I wrote this and recorded it today.  I normally do pop rock / alternative, so this is somewhat softer than my usual style, so I am looking for constructive criticism please I would really appreciate it.  

The song is called [Therapy] (https://soundcloud.com/test_subject8889/therapy)

(for reference I use a USB studio condenser mic if that means anything to you.)

Thank you in advance! 




 no, but you can patent an invention or copyright a screenplay 




 yes; I found out about wordle when I was writing my first novel back in 2008.  It was in two parts, so I made a wordle from each part; I thought of maybe including the result as a page in the published book, at the beginning of the respective parts.

It is a great visual aid and quite pretty to look at. 




 hi; I've only read excerpts of your books and seen some of your videos (all of which were excellent, btw; I love the way they are organized), and (as I write, blog, and make music) I was wondering:

**What did you find most surprising about 'making it' as a writer and as a youtuber?  as in, things that were much easier or harder than expected, or unexpected obstacles which you faced in the process?   ** 




 I saw the title and thought of him too, sneaking in through someone's window, so don't worry 




 given that it was tiny and detailed, and her writing was large and floppy, I assumed the killer drew her in the park. 




 I would think that as long as it is different enough, or only a slight preview, it doesn't matter, but I don't really know. 

I'm just basing that off of PenPal from /r/nosleep .  The author took the series, fleshed it out, exapnded upon it, and then published the result as a full-fledged Amazon book.  However, the original stories are still online on nosleep 




 get it copyrighted first.   




 well you can read kindle books on pc, and nook (for one) can use the kindle app as can any other android device, be it a phone, tablet, etc.  Even windows mobile devices can use the kindle app.   




 there is also an amazing comic that fits this prompt, which I discovered from someone linking it in a comment somewhere....found it: https://imgur.com/gallery/h2my0 




 Drama: He bided his time before asking her out.  Even once they were together, he carefully observed her actions and words; he was the attentive listener women say they want to find.  He made sure to be there for her whenever she might need him.  Although she led a busy life, he would always clear his schedule for her.  He had come to love her favorite restaurant almost as much as she did.  He could see them growing old together, and going to that cozy restaurant by the pier for every anniversary.  Then, he got a phone call which made his whole world shatter.

Comedy: She thought he was a nice guy, and he seemed to be really interested, so she figured she could give it a shot; it's whatever.  She lied about having to work late sometimes so that she could hang out with her superficial friends instead.  He always seemed to give her even more attention after such nights.  It's funny how a little distance can make people want you more.  She chuckled at the thought of him chasing after her like a confused puppy. He made some of the silliest, and to her mind, stupidest faces sometimes, especially when he just looked at her.  He was a real clown.  She kept going with him to the same restaurant on the pier; she could think of nothing else to do with him other than have good food and good fun.  Although it was her favorite restaurant, she was getting tired of going there; they had worn it out.  So she picked up the phone.

-----------

[I know that's not really funny, but when I read the prompt, I thought of this sort of relationship, and how to him its serious (drama) but to her its just a game (comedy).  hope you like it anyways ] 




 thank you for the quick reply! 




 the issue here being, although it is my writing, the idea would have originated from a prompt thought of by someone else.  So, it would be prompt inspired.  

So, I think it would be ok to publish as long as I credited the prompt idea, but that only applies to publishing on a personal webpage or something similar.

What if I wanted to expand upon the idea and publish the resulting longer, more developed story in a publication which pays for submissions?  Is it ok to do that? 









 I read your previous post and this one.  I have no experience with entities inflicting physical damage to a person, only mental and emotional.  drawing blood is serious, obviously.  

If you're looking for a logical explanation, (well even not, I think that's the starting point if for nothing else to rule it out):  there's the possibility it was the cat, and there's the possibility that you sleepwalk/other sleep actions.  To that end, you mentioned in your comments linked to in the previous post, that you have done hallucinogens.  Did those, by any chance include LSD?  If so, it is possible for you to experience a random acid trip.  I'm not saying the scratches aren't real.  Not at all.  I'm just mentioning, in case you didn't know, that you are subject to that.

Ok, logical bases covered, the next is the usual suspects:
poltergeist.  This is what you seemed to be describing for the post part in Chicago.  For this incident, if an entity of some sort caused these scratches, it would have to be either a poltergeist or a demonic entity.  

If, given your history, you don't sense anything, I don't think there's really a risk that it's anything demonic.  It may be a poltergeist who has taken issue with your bf and thus has not presented anything to you.  

Someone mentioned something following you; that would be an attached spirit.  Ususally attached spirits are benign or benevolent.  A malevolent spirit would only attach to a person if they had specific beef with them and were looking for revenge or to torment them.  Normally, malevolent/vengeful spirits are tied to places, such as where they died.  So I don't think an attached spirit is possible in this case.  Unless they'd have a reason to want to drive your bf away to protect you, although your ex sounds like more of a person from which you'd need protection, so that idea has no traction either.

Speaking of Liam, I had a thought while reading the previous post.  Did he use heroin before moving into that house?  Did they move into that house not too long before?  or when he was younger?  if it was a more recent move, its possible the ghost of the heroin addict drove him to try it.  You mentioned using hallucinogens.  Did you ever do that before living in that house with Liam?  Clearly he was a bad influence regardless, but I wonder if he had been negatively influenced by the spirits in the home as well.

Just my thoughts.  Hope something in here is helpful to you.   Sorry for rambling. 




 made me tear up.  thanks for sharing! 




 she is really open to it/ perceptive of it I guess.  I assume you mean physically see with her eyes?  or do you mean in her mind's eye that she can feel them and visualizes them as dots? 




 oh, then you are missing out.  I personally liked his Words Words Words special (it was on Comedy Central) a little better than What.  That was how I first found out about him.   









 no the rule is to have more than one account; one for normal things using your usual un, and one for other things 




 thanks! :) 




 I, not realizing I'd read your posts before, was one of the "dome people", lol
