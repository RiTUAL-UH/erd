 Why can't you love me?! 




 D-d-d... Dad? 




 Montrealers are a very creative people, and it seems their police are no different. 




 Fugh yo' anussiation. 




 The turret on the inflatable tank reminded me of a big, floppy dildo. 




 Anything for the memes, your dankness. 




 I watched this twice to see if he'd eventually do it. He did not. 




 Pay off my student debt and buy as much meth as I can with $80,000. That should change my life substantially. 




 Eleven-and-a-half, thank you very much mister. 




 That thing belongs in a time capsule or a museum, not a landfill. 




 This gif made me say, "Huh. That's something." 




 Sir,  
  
Do you consider memes a form of art, or are they something else we can appreciate on an entirely different level? Also, do you believe the danker the meme the better it is? 




 K. 




 Is he okay? Did he manage to find his way outside? 




 That was terrifying until he actually fell all the way in, and then it didn't seem so bad. 




 For those of you who prefer the company of a male escort, Pacman does the same thing. 




 OP's mom. 




 The content on reddit. 




 Fallout 3. I always get way too immersed in the storyline. I never want it to end. 




 Thank you for letting me peruse through your old PS3 games, gentle sir! 




 I like this. 




 Ah, the ol' light switcheroo. 




 They're emulating Americans in every way possible now. 




 His meme is dank, therefore he is also dank. 




 Your friend really needs to polish his faucet.

 Your punctuation isn't very good either, or is that the joke? 




 What a bitch. 




 Ruh roh! 




 And they help you poop! 




 One big scar  many tiny scars 




 This is a cumulus fractus cloud, which is the beginning (or end) stage of a larger cumulus cloud. Because it's forming (or possibly dissipating), it is constantly changing its shape. 




 That language's name? English. 




 Mmmmm! Sour! 




 I hope that if I ever accomplish something heroic, I'll be stuffed and put on display in a museum. 




 How can someone think making something like this is normal? 




 So, we unbelievers shouldn't be scared because they just want to kill us? I'm confused. 




 Dogs can't see television, but they pretend to like it so they can be close to you.

 Hey, everyone, look! It's the [guy from the Internet!](http://dilbert.com/strip/2015-06-07) 




 I spent years having to listen to ignorant, racist assholes tell stupid fucking jokes like this at work. Thankfully, I'm no longer working in an environment like that. I'm glad you lost your job, because if you're saying shit like this at work then you need to learn a fucking lesson.

Edit: A lot of the replies to this comment are absolutely abhorrent. I'm not sure if they're jokes or meant to be serious. Regardless, it's very disheartening to see so much racism in this thread. I know it's the Internet, but I expected more from reddit. I genuinely hope that despite whatever hateful things your parents taught you, you break the circle of ignorance by not passing down your racist attitudes to your children. They deserve better. The world deserves better. 




 I downvote every comment I see that is edited like yours, and I hope others do the same.

 Shows how stupid America is if they almost voted her and McCain into the White House. 




 Throw Mama From the Train? 




 A good doctor knows he is not a judge. 




 It's amazing that they were able to put his jaw back together. It's even more amazing that he kept most of his teeth intact. 




 A blank screw. Sharpen it and use it as a nail. 




 I liked the pictures with the boobies. 




 Just because you did those things doesn't make you a bad person. You're working on changing the things in your life that have caused you to hurt yourself and others, and it takes a strong, courageous person to do that. Keep fighting and maintain that courage and you'll have no reason to feel guilty. 




 If that's the worst that's ever happened to you, consider yourself lucky. 




 The fuck? There's no way this is real. 




 What do you feel guilty about? 




 TL;DR: Girl started period in class and her teacher wouldn't let her go to washroom, so the football player told teacher off, escorted her to washroom and rode the crimson wave, then got suspended. The end. 




 You own high school athletes? How much are you selling them for? 




 This is why I don't shop at Walmart. That and my fear of being run over by a 500 lb man on a mobility scooter. 




 I love beef just as much as the next dude, but I make a conscious effort to limit how much I eat. There's no need to eat 5 Big Macs a week. 




 Put it on the roof of her mouth and she'll lick it for hours ;)

 [Here's a chart showing land use](https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screen-shot-2013-05-13-at-3-45-14-pm.png?w=664 h=411). I couldn't find one summing up water usage, but there's definitely more than one out there in the interwebz.  
  
[Here's another interesting info graphic showing how much water is consumed during the lifecycle of a typical beef cow.] (http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53ddf6b0e4b0219ea2c8b53f/t/5486139ae4b08d78fd1dd863/1418072986569/) And this is the [source for that picture](http://www.swissbiofarmer.com/blog/). 




 Cows are the most land and water intensive livestock to raise. That's why people in many countries eat less beef and tend to eat more pork, goat, and other smaller farm animals that can be kept in smaller spaces. Also, people in other countries tend to eat a lot less of everything than the average North American. 




 How are you adjusting to life outside of a cult? 




 Trolls? I though this was real! HYUK! 




 Plot twist: OP's neighbours are actually Scottish.

 You totally want a bite of this sandwich. 




 Someone on reddit must know who this dick is. 




 Let's start a crowd funding campaign to get OP a decent phone! 




 I'm just busting your balls! Here, have [this](http://i.imgur.com/PBq85Yd.gif). 




 My sense of humour says downvote, but my boner says upvote. 




 And what did you learn, OP?

Yeah, maybe that way they could have the humvees relocate themselves back to the US. 




 His mom gave the graduation speech. 




 Because you asked them to. 




 Are all these going to be in Fallout 4? 




 OP made this himself for the karma. 




 I'm just here for the "udder" puns. Post them below!

 Oh, shit! Abort! Abort! 




 Amen, dude. Seriously, though, who the fuck "needs" almonds? 




 The country doesn't "need" the produce grown in California. There wouldn't be a problem if farmers there were able to switch to crops that required less water, and people learned to eat produce grown in a more ecologically sustainable manner rather than cramming whatever they like down their gullet. 




 Much money. So euphoric. 




 Step 1: Beat cat  
  
Step 2: Take picture  
  
Step 3: Karma! 




 What happened to his eye? 




 Sorry, but it seems you're actually stupid *and* ignorant. 




 ***ignorance intensifies*** 




 This is bullshit - you're oversimplifying a complex situation to the point of no longer adding anything to the discussion. 




 Fucking Americans. 




 Not only is this a shitpost, it's a repost of a shitpost.

 That's called a boner, son. 




 Please stop trying to ruin the internet with your childishness. 




 Oh, Jesus. 




 How long before this happens again? 




 Must be nice. I live in a typical North American city where an ambulance is lucky to be acknowledged when it has its lights and siren on. 




 My penis shrivelled and fell off. 




 You're a pretty good shot if you're hitting a moving dove with a .308. 




 Cut to the chase: is he a jackdaw or a crow? 




 Dem titties!

 That's, ummm... not how you use this meme, sir. I'm going to have to ask you to show yourself out. 




 My conversations with the GPS is usually a one-way shouting match.

 Tree planter, accountant, imam. What a strange career progression.

 I thought to myself as the site loaded for what felt like an eternity, "This better fucking well be worth it." And it was. 




 It's sad how little progress has been made in United States' backwards penal system. Tell an American that, though, and I'm sure they'll tell you otherwise.
