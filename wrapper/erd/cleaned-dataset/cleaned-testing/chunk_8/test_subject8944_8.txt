 I know. I even checked before I posted my comment and nobody had called him out yet. Dude had about 750 upvotes, so likely 1000 people just voting on his comment and not one bothered to fact check it? Like really? 




 Yes he is. By average of the polls over the last month, he's in first place actually. The worst he's doing in any poll is 2nd, by 3%.

 Ok but I'm saying if they get terrible they won't get better. 




 Ok let's be real:

1) The reason we say don't vote for third parties is because of the spoiler effect leading to possibly your least favorite choice winning.

2) Obviously an individual vote doesn't make a difference. The closest vote in electoral history was Florida in 2000 that had a difference of 537 votes (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_close_election_results).

3) Thus, the reason we say don't vote third party is because we don't want people to encourage others to vote third party because then we may end up with the least desirable candidate winning.

4) So even if you live in a non-swing state, you shouldn't encourage others to vote third party because it may turn your state into a swing state if you have enough sway, or if you make a few people decide to vote third and they in turn make people decide to vote third in the next election and so on, until your state that would have been a safe state is now a swing state a few elections down the road. 




 While this is true on a micro level, if you start it and others follow then eventually enough may follow so that your state turns into a swing state. 




 But if you don't follow the rules, then the greater evil candidate can win. And they DEFINITELY won't change it so that your vote elects someone else. 




 Because you don't change it by voting for your favorite candidate. Think of it this way: if there's a democrat you're meh on, an independent you love, and a republican you hate- and you (and enough others) vote for the independent, causing the republican to win where the democrat otherwise would have- then the republicans are in charge and your arugment is that this will somehow be a message to them to change the voting system? Maybe it will, but wouldn't they be completely disincentivized from changing the system because they won in the current system?

You need to change the electoral system before you abide by its voting rules. 




 Wouldn't that get a little confusing with current President Clinton? 




 Completely agree. But until we change the electoral system, we must play by their rules. 




 Vote for whoever you want in the primary, but when it comes to the General, you need to pick the lesser of the two evils. Otherwise you risk splitting the vote and having the least desirable candidate win. 




 Yea, but you'll also go to jail. So you may be "up" $10K, but then you spend 2 years in jail not earning money during that time. 




 List all loans with interest rate and all income and expenses 




 Wait what goes in that last blank? Nearby street name? 




 Or fired when they realize your job is automated... 




 Dude's about to make a killing. Likely punitive damages after his lawyer argues that this is just the first time the cops got caught. 




 For real. As a 1L I've only ever talked to 2Ls. Also, this would have been more appropriate to post last semester. I know what I'm doing now. 




 You linked Austin and he's in Houston FYI. 




 For real. I would feel very good about volunteering to do this for a weekend. Is there any place I can search to see if these fake clinics are in my area? 




 This just made me think: if there are pro-life protesters outside of abortion clinics, couldn't pro-choice protesters go stand outside of these fake clinics and warn people? 




 . 




 Don't do this without consulting a lawyer first. 




 Ah I though you were saying waive it for the year, not permanently. That seems like a long shot but I see your logic. 




 Hire a lawyer to investigate.

Possible they have a different person with the same name. Possible he was convicted in absence (although then he would have had a warrant and the cops would not have let him go). Possible the clerk just entered it in wrong. 




 If they waive the graduation requirement he'll still have to complete the classes though and thus wouldn't be able to attend the college anyways. But if he does summer classes, they wouldn't have to waive the requirement. 




 Your family should hire a lawyer. If you completed the classes, I'm not sure they can withhold the credits, even if it's "policy." However, I could easily be wrong. A quick consult with a lawyer should clear it up.

As others have pointed out, can you do summer school for the credits? Through your current high school or community college?

Oh I just thought of another idea! Can you have your Wisconsin high school transfer the credits back to Ohio school and graduate from there?
 




 Just a note, but you usually have a duty to return the apt to the condition you received it in. So if it was filthy (AND YOU CAN PROVE THAT) then you would at least likely get the "extra cleaning" fee back.

Other than that, by looks the door knob is 3x the price, the covers are 2x and everything else looks somewhat reasonable. 




 Age is really the defining factor on if this was child abuse. 




 Well well well. How the tables have turned... 




 Not over 4%, 3.8%. Yes, 2.07% is the average for past 10 years and usually the target inflation rate. A plausible rate would 2% + whatever % accounts for defaults. 




 4%?!? Inflation rates are currently close to 0%. It hasn't been over 4% in the last 24 years.

 Now I'm imagining a world where every person in a seedy bar files rape charges against their one night stand when they find out their partner was not a "secret agent" the next morning. 




 Maybe so. 




 Well he's likely worried about it getting worse. 




 Exactly! That's why the high school student is saying he's afraid of the crisis! Because even if he has perfectly legit credit, it may be too restricted. 




 So he's wrong... Like I said. 




 I skimmed and must have missed it. I guess don't respond if you don't want to. 




 It severely increased the requirements, which is what the high school student is concerned about. 




 Ha, no. 




 Wait how? Just because the electoral numbers don't add up? It doesn't work like that.

Perot was much closer to Bush than he was Clinton. So if we say for example that, of those who voted for Perot, 60% would vote for Bush and 40% for Clinton, Bush would have a clear majority of votes. Then you'd have to distribute that on a state by state basis, but the consensus is that Bush would have won. 




 Duverger's Law. Our current system is set up so there will only ever be two parties. You're supposed to pick the lesser evil of the two. 




 Because if banks see graduates not paying their loans then the banks won't make any more loans in the future. 




 Likely whatever state your grandfather was in. 




 Likely yes, if your mother died after your grandfather.

You'll want to hire an attorney.

Also don't be surprised if a substantial part of the money has already been spent by your aunt. 




 Sally saw it. 




 Best thing you can do to driver her away from him is make her see him as she sees you. Next time he's over offer him a beer and sit in the backyard talking about 401Ks and taxes. Ask how his golf game is. Anything to make her see him as old. 




 It'd be funny if the parents were still paying Lucas. 




 Ok fine let's say they are legally retarded, defined as IQ under 70 (if I remember correctly) and they believe they are not, and hire me to follow them around telling them they're not.

However, to your substantive point, I agree they are still evil scum taking advantage of a vulnerable population. Further, I agree that we, as a society, have a duty to identify vulnerable populations and expose them to other methods that can help them instead of letting them fall prey to bad influences.

From a Due Process standpoint, we cannot merely make it illegal to charge for "reading fortunes" without a host of other issues. Instead, we could treat it like the Pay Day Loan industry and heavily regulate it where people can still use the services but are substantially less likely to be **completely** taken advantage of. 




 Ok, let's say a person believes they are beautiful but everyone calls them ugly. So they hire me to follow them around all day calling them beautiful. Even though it's a lie, it makes them feel good. Why should they not be able to do this? It's their own free will. Yea they could get better support from a psychiatrist, but they chose me to make them feel better. 




 That is realistically the only way I see him winning. 




 I agree. Obviously, in real life, the line is crossed much more frequently from "person helping widow get over her grief" to "taking every penny possible."

It's a crap business to be in on either side for completely different reasons. 




 Yea I see your point. To further play devil's advocate: let's say there's an old couple with no kids or family. The husband dies. The wife believes in mediums. Why shouldn't she get to spend the rest of her money to "talk" to her husband? It's still 100% her choice. Nobody if forcing her to spend the money. 




 To buy out an entire theater on opening day for a popular movie would be what the theater expected to make plus a fee. So assuming it sold out and you only wanted the theater for one showing time, lets say $10/ticket and $150 seats, you could probably rent it out for $2,000. But you still have to drive there, sit in crappy seats, and be seen in public, which isn't feasible if you're Lebron. 




 See I get the hate, but then a part of me thinks if it actually comforts the person is it not worth something? Obviously $10K would be wayyyy over the top. But if for something like $100 someone was comforted that their dead loved one was "doing well in the afterlife" that would be reasonable, right? 




 I would agree with the statement that we know nothing concrete from all presidential elections, especially because they are spread out over such a large period of time. That's not to say we know nothing of election theory because we have many thousands to analyze in the last 10 years alone, in the US. 




 Nobody is in charge. Who is "they" in your "they wouldn't run her again" example?

It's all just voters voting on whoever has enough name recognition and screws up the least. 




 n=10 is NOTHING in statistics. You need a sample size of at least 1000 to to even establish a weak correlation, let alone causation. 




 In your situation, assuming you are moving states, it would seem wise to move as soon as your last final ends and just come back for graduation. Or you could just skip it. 




 Not the person you replied to but I'd imagine if he continued to live like he was near homeless (think $20K) on a salary of someone who finished graduate school (maybe $100K) and invested that at 7% (average stock market return), he could easily be a millionaire in 13 years. 




 RED ALERT ON PRO #2!!!

Even if the seller is an attorney, you pay your own attorney to look over the contract and advise you. He could easily write a contract with a term you don't understand and screw you over with, **especially because he's an attorney.** It will not be a big expense compared to all the other closing costs. You'll still want title insurance, a survey, and inspection (which will all be required by the bank anyways). Do not cheap out on the attorney, or it could easily come back to bit you for 10 times the cost.

Other than that, just be aware you will independently (as in without your friend) be responsible for the entire mortgage payment if the upstairs rents move out.

Also be aware of the potential costs you're taking on. Water heater/AC break? Your expense. Tenants upstairs literally begin taking axes to the walls? You'll need to take proper eviction proceedings and know how to do that (you'll need an attorney). This will require an emergency fund for the house specifically of at least $10,000.

Edit: Just saw Con #2. Don't do it. You are not ready. Doesn't mean you won't be ready in the future, but you're not now. 




 W 




 I tried to look at the MTurk article, admittedly not thoroughly, and didn't see what they defined as "child." Is it just under 18? Cause then like 99% of guys would be attracted to a post-pubescent "hot" 17 year old. And then that would make the study a lot less noteworthy in my opinion. 




 Would you like to bet on it? 




 No round winner or loser. It's a tie. 




 Ok but if it's your injuries you would want pictures then? 




 Nope.

I'm saying ROUNDS can be competitive, even where the FIGHT isn't even close.

Example: if every round was identical, with Also outstriking Mendes by a single punch each round with the power and everything else even, then it would be a clear 50-45. That's a fight that's not even close but was competitive as hell. 




 If you're employees are not busy at some points, you could have them hold a sign counter-protesting with something like "We did give him correct change. Ask me about it." and have the employee give a short blurb if you're worried about losing potential customers.

Plus, since this guy seems a little nuts, if he threatens any employee you can report it to the police. 




 If I were you, I would tell your landlord that you won't be moving out. Instead, move stuff to be reasonably messy around the house. By early May, (s)he'll be begging you to move out and likely offer you some money instead of you paying for months you won't even live there.

Your landlord is strong arming you right now because it's working. Stop play by their rules. You can easily flip the tables. 




 For real. I've paid about $5,000 on my cat's various illnesses. I know technically she's worth maybe $20, but to me she's worth a lot more.

A lot of time on /r/legaladvice I see very uncaring attitudes. I wish people giving advice on here showed a little more compassion sometimes. 




 Eh I guess he'll just have to face Khabib instead. 




 I love that you set your post up so that someone answering "yes" means two different things. It depends if they're replying to your title or the text body. 




 Completely agreed. I think a competitive fight can still result in a clear decision. 




 I completely agree. I'm not saying it wasn't competitive, only that Aldo clearly won and it wasn't close (by that I mean, it wasn't very arguable that Mendes won). 




 Then you consented to the search. The proper thing to do in that situation would have been to wait for the dogs. 




 If you clearly win 4 rounds, then you clearly win the fight. 




 What reason did they give for searching after you denied? 




 I actually agree with you. Frankie is a much busier fighter. I know it wasn't a lot of time, but even in this fight, Lamas was hitting Mendes much more before he was dropped. Frankie is non-stop work for 25 minutes. If he avoids getting caught, I think he takes Mendes. 




 Every judge had it 49-46. That's not that close. Granted some of the rounds weren't runaways, but they were all pretty clear. 




 Well maybe they really do hate him. Can't imagine why. 




 Agreed. I see it as the classic two wrestlers end up in a striking match. And I think Frankie is just busier and more accurate. Granted Mendes has more power, but as long as Frankie doesn't get caught too badly (although he does have a hell of a chin), he'll grab a unanimous decision. 




 I think of a super fight as 2 champs fights. If Aldo gets the immediate shot it'll be a super fight to me. 




 And the 1 win was a split decision. 




 Oh thanks. 




 Not to mention that we're going to be seeing JBJ with more cardio than he's ever had before, because he won't be dealing with a weight cut. 




 I'm pretty positive Aldo will move up after his win and get an immediate title shot. You'll have a super fight in early 2016. 




 See I always think that, but the way Edgar just absolutely manhandled Cub makes me question it.

I sincerely hope Aldo moves up after McG, and Edgar sweeps the floor with Urijah and we get Mendes/Edgar for new championship. That's the only fight in the division that would make be worthy of a championship fight after Aldo leaves. 




 I just want your post to have at least one positive comment. I agree with you. 




 The fans were booing the decision, not the fighters. At least that's how I interpret booing after a close decision. 




 You don't have to verbally tell the victim, just make them apprehensive. Walking at them with your fist raised would usually be more than enough in most jurisdictions. 




 I'm in San Diego. That about as South and West you can get. Get ready for the expensive housing though. 




 Usually assault too though. 




 Thanks so much man! 




 Ok that's the thing I don't know. I haven't driven a manual since I was 15. 




 Thanks for the insight. I think I'm just gonna have to bite the bullet and thank myself later. 




 Where would I find these? Is there a specific website? I'm in California if that helps. 




 So if I tank this semester just enough.... 




 Thank you for your input. 




 I don't get this reference. Is there a manufacturing problem with the car? 




 That's another thing I was afraid of. This coming Fall, assuming my grades stay stable, I don't want to be asked why I'm not on it and have it come off as if I'm lazy.

Do you know approximately the time commitment per week? 




 Real way to fix the problem: sit in one of the first 2 rows. 




 I am decently sure I'll be an automatic admit to Law Review after 1L finishes. I'm wondering how much it actually helps in job searches. I have zero interest in actually reading, writing, or editing articles in excess to classes and an internship, but if it gives me a big boost I'll do it.

Any input appreciated. 




 Didn't even know of that subreddit! Thanks! 




 No gear to move. No kids. Not fat or tall. No snow.

Which of the cars you mentioned is best? I assume the smaller for better MPG? 




 Budget is anything up to $20,000 really. But I don't want to pay anywhere near that. Just whatever is the most cost cost effective.

As for what I require: literally nothing except basic safety.

I realize this is broad, but I'm just trying to find what the best deal possible is.
