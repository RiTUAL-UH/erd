 Izzy left for france ages ago. Axl always swore he was anti-everything. Looks like he's a drinker though from that pic up above. Fat!  




 OH NO! I had not seen this puffing up. Yowza.  




 Gummy Granny 




 Samesies.  




 It's frequently wrong, too. People are so bizarre to try to guess. I know too many people who have been called Mexican-American when they are not, or African-American when they are not. So strange, bizarre cultural hangup.  




 Yep. He's European.  




 Saw them with Blind Melon not long before their lead singer died. Blind Melon came on stage and everyone boo'd and started chanting "GNR", and Shannon Hune said "shut the fuck up or we'll play longer" 




 He buttered her muffin and then played her the godfather theme. 
Like so:

 I was waiting to board a plane when I noticed a guy wearing a great t-shirt. It was a drawing of a classic nintendo, and under it "You always remember your first". Loved the shirt. Got on the plane, took off, and the stewardesses were serving drinks. A woman one row up got coffee. The stewardess spilled the coffee on the woman's baby, who immediately began shrieking. Meanwhile my kid had just fallen asleep, double concern for the burned baby and now my kid, who might actually SLEEP through a plane ride, is going to wake up screaming too. They asked whether anyone on the plane was a doctor and the nintendo t-shirt guy was a pediatrician. 
 









 Wrong. No one ever "asks" for a loaded gun pointed at his face. Got a dispute? get out of your big metal vehicle and talk about it like an adult. This is shit that should land him in prison for a long fucking time, and a lifelong ban on owning firearms. ABSURD.  




 Absolutely illegal.  




 Would love to know that guy lost his right to ever own a gun again. That is absolutely unbelievable.  




 Where ARE all those responsible gun owners? Please, all of you band together and take down these NRA fucktards terrorizing america.  









 Libertarians and the tea party are a combo of paid shills and fucking idiots.  




 Actually he has a huge raging clue. Read up on his history in Vermont, the change in voter turnout after his first term, the coming there and his policies.  




 But we can let it slide. 

Edit: weird! A slide pun and downvoted. Ach, this photo major is disgusted with reddit.  




 They've also identified the shooter.

 If the story of Kalief doesn't make you cry, I think you should get checked out. Absolutely horrific. The shit of nightmares. Everyone involved in his case should spend a few years at Ryker's while their lives disintegrate. And his mom should get many million dollars, obviously nothing can bring her son back but let's take away the worries we can in her life.  




 then he's humming ***What would you do for a KLONDIKE BAR!?*** 




 What about the nail!?!? **my vagina is fucking wincing** 




 They're all haunted. Bugged? Probably.  









 And take away his right to terrorize with guns. If he's so fearful he should really be in therapy. If the zoo is that unsafe, call in the national guard to protect us. Bubba is just making us less safe.  




 Making people unsafe so he can wave his pretend dick around and endanger children out with their families = exhibiting a constitutional right? No, my friend. He is a terrorist. Sanity rules.  




 So glad the judge is ruling on the side of safety. Ugh. As a parent, I'm over it. Enough. There are so many dead kids in our country right now because of this shit. No, you don't need your gun at the zoo. If you feel so unsafe at a zoo that you feel you need a weapon like that, go see a god damned therapist and stop ruining America.  









 A decades-old gun law in Connecticut requiring residents to have a permit before purchasing a handgun is credited with helping to reduce the state's firearms-related homicide rate by 40 percent, according to a new study. 









 Vote Bernie FFS 














 That is incredibly interesting and reasonable.  




 Can I ask if you had a cesarean delivery? 




 Yep. And we lose them at 5-6.  




 Bravo! Extended BF-er myself. Yeah, everybody thinks it's weird, and I have a calm healthy happy kid.  




 Wait, you saw KKK fliers on Long Island?? 




 Clearly M stands for Men.  




 **What's in the BOX** 









 If you feel the Bern for more than 4 hours, see a doctor.  




 "One of the individuals made the statement that if it was God's will to shoot children and teachers, and if the other suspect wanted the suspect to do so, they would have proceeded to start shooting children and teachers," Holland said. 


































 I think it was the death of a man and injury of 3 others that makes the call for change so imperative.

Wal-Mart truck driven by Kevin Roper crashed into a vehicle carrying Morgan and his entourage. One person, James McNair, was killed, while three were injured.  



















 Yeah, I think there might be a "new wave" of young adults on reddit with no critical analysis skills. Isn't that what they got rid of in the Dubbya era? 

off my lawn, etc. 









 I want to see congressional hearings on this case.  




 I wish we had elections and politics that dealt with this type of shit, instead of whatever the GOP is on about these days. Promoting more weapons and less access to women's healthcare? Berating Obama?  




 Gotta think the social skills and physical activity at preschool make it the better choice though. When you sit watching tv, your heart rate is like you're asleep, right?  




 There is a huge push for Single Payer in the US right now. It's comin. 












































 Each of the ninety dead Americans each day should be a headline. If it were, people would have awareness of the plague that is guns in America.  




 I read that as saying it was the shooter whose nice-people label was taken into question.  




 The right wing has grown into a large right tumor that's infected much of our nation. Living through a terrorist sniper for the last month in northern Colorado. It's fucked beyond belief.  




 2015 is the year of the gun in America. Convincing many to move to Canada.  




 Wait wait wait wait wait...a three year old accesses a gun, shoots himself, and no charges are filed?! You know, if that kid found a pot brownie and ate it, he'd probably be removed from the home and charges filed against both parents. Oh America pull the gun barrel out of your fucking ass.  




 Such as...? 




 That's disappointing and horrific all in one.  





























 Right? Should've gone with "upper cellar" #obv!  




 Are you a parent? 




 I have a great idea for an invention to stop this from happening. I emailed and wrote about it to people and heard nothing back. How can someone get a safety invention picked up? Not an inventor by trade so no fucking clue what to do with it, but as a mom I am ill every time I see a story like this. That mom's life is over. So much grief. 
 









 This is fucking disturbing.  



















 Fucking Christ this shit must end. The klan is taking over.  
























 **F**uck **I**t **F**uckin' **A**
