 I mean Davos. He's well-played and a compelling character, but it seemed like a bit of a cheat that he survived the wildfire explosion when he was so near he could see wildfire leaking out the back of the ship. With him dying, it seemed to give more resonance to the fleet being destroyed and it gave more of a human face to all the people that died in that scene. As is, the main character we've gotten to know who died at that battle was Davos's son, who was kind of one-note and unlikable.  




 Like, how did the Soviet news report on their involvement in Vietnam? Did they deny it on their news? Did they say "Yeah, we're doing all this and it's justified for the following reasons"? Did they have televised debates about things? If yes, we're they completely loaded debates?  

 




 Honestly, even as a kid, I remember thinking that bikes looked cooler than big wheels. But having since become very familiar with how uncomfortable bike seats are, I would be open to trying a design more like a big wheel these days.  




 No shotgun?

I have a feeling there's more to the story than we're hearing since both main figures involved have since become larger-than-life since, but it's still an interesting story.  









 And Scratchy! 




 You were right. 
 




 "This is the kind of kid we grind up to use for the additives in your Lunchables."  




 Eh, it's just the few suicidal people throwing the averages off.  









 I'm not necessarily saying it's the deepest movie in the world, but when people praise Tree of Life (2011) for being like this really transcendent and the like, I assume they'd be able to explain why. But when I saw it, all I thought was "This is pretty! I like the music! That looks pretty too! Oh, this is moody!" I'm basically like a stoned six year-old when I watch that thing. 

You have any that do that for you?   




 I thought for sure this was going to turn out to be a man wearing prosthetics.  














 Skip the scene where Tarantino is rambling, though.  




 AAUAUAAAGGGGGHHHH! 




 Tropic Thunder 2 on the horizon then?  




 What made you feel like doing an AMA?  














 No, Cupcakes references get inserted in the other end.  




 With deepest shame, I admit I find this hot.  




 A woman miscarried, was too fat to realize it (or that she'd ever been pregnant) and the fetus decomposed in her for some time.  




 Finish what you started, Wrex.  




 I'm Justin Bieber and I can't be 21 years old either.  




 Dude, we've seen Arya lose every time she holds up a sword against an armed opponent on equal footing and we've seen Brienne get rough and tumble while moving pretty fast. She could keep up with Jamie (admittedly when he was rusty but he was still probably in better shape than Arya.) 

The Stark Girl would meet her butcher's boy. 
 




 I wonder how many times some passerbys decided to ruin a timelapse shot by messing with their camera.  




 Why aren't they fighting!? I was promised fighting! 














 Burton struck me as headstrong enough he would have been screwed pretty quickly in that situation.  









 Coffee flavor analyzed! 




 How much have you been in mortal danger since arriving?  




 I don't see any sources cited.  




 Yeah, but it was what happened to me from square one, so I can't relate to feeling lonely about it.  




 Hey, Steve? The mechanical shark is over there... 




 He ain't about to bite the Canadian Film Board's hand, though.  




 Like my next thing in mind is a guy who sort of goads the comment section a bit, so what are the rules for that? And another one is about a main character who's a white supremacist, what would be the policy for that?  




 That's it! Thanks! 




 Shame you didn't have a gopro on.  




 Nope. We needed to put Legolas and company in. No time in the nine hours for those guys.  




 When the hell was this movie witty? It was as broad as it gets.  



















 Oh God, I worked at a restaurant for a couple years and those demanding types were often the worst tippers. Is it better over there?  




 What's your worst "customer from Hell" story?  




 My listicle won't write itself! 




 It's a 2d game, kind of a point n click if I remember right, which begins with a girl in some superficially pleasant but in truth creepy village about to be sacrificed to some monster. 

Thanks for your time 




 He must have spent years telling people he was Francis Ford Coppola.  














 Don't ever wash her in the same bathtub as Rarity or the colors are going to run. 




 I forget to mention that I meant in person, excuse me.  




 A larper!

Show him no mercy! 




 Oh wow, that must have been tiring to hold the sword up and still for that long.

 This was after the Serpico expose, right?  




 I keep hearing this piece of advice, but I am curious if there are any anecdotes of people who needed this advice? It seems like the sort of thing you wouldn't expect anyone to have thought in hindsight, but there's always someone who believed a surprising thing.  




 I guess I should have said "pacing" or something like that. Whatever, downvote it if you like.  




 Oh, so one snowman from back then looks creepy and then suddenly ALL snowmen looked creepy back then? #YesAllSnowmen 




 It's not really that impressive to have that much saved up by 28 if you don't do anything with your life except your job, but thank you for the compliment.  




 I was just watching Interstellar with my brother and he described to me afterwards how towards the end, he was thinking "end! End!" I asked him if what was happening was bad or uninteresting or something, and he said no, but he just felt like the movie should be over. 

I really don't get people watching movies like they have to be film critics. I don't care if a scene doesn't drive the plot forward or if the "peaks and valleys" aren't timed out properly or whatever. I care how interesting the scene I'm watching is or if there's a likelihood based on previous scenes whether it will become interesting. That might say more about me than it does movies, but it just seems like caring about a movie's pace is just giving yourself a reason not to like it.  









 Suppose someone somehow got onto live television on that sort of show and delivered a rant similar to the one Bing Madsen delivers and then kills themselves, and it either airs or someone recorded it with a phone and then leaked it. How do you imagine you would react if you were watching? 









 I've lived in the same town for twenty-eight years. I've wanted to move for a long time but my livelihood is pretty tied to my location and the place I most want to move to isn't hiring in that field (I checked their local job listings.) I make a couple thousand off stuff I do online and have $30,000 saved up, but I've been worried it will all just crash and burn and then have to move back up here with a worse job. 

So have any of you tried moving away from a town you're tired of, considered that a problem, etc. How'd it work out?  




 Still looking forward to Chappie, though.

 




 No, or I guess I'm attached to it the way I'm attached to gum stuck to my fingers that I'm trying to flick off. I am actively working to get rid of it.   




 I read somewhere that he's supposed to have said that movies aren't ideally supposed to be "enjoyable" experiences. Can anyone confirm or deny that?  









 Thank you very much! 









 I remember reading that someone compiled a bunch of the most bizarre personal stories ever posted on Reddit. Like there was one from a medical professional about a woman who injected IV drugs into her taint, a "cumbox" that someone felt compelled to masturbate into, etc. Does anyone happen to remember that or have it saved? 

Thanks for your time 




 So Pinkie's not a natural pink?  




 But when the Google corporation becomes elected president, it will be able to use its translate function for every language.

 We find the machine works a lot better if you break the doll first.  









 It's not like it's going to go bad or anything: Dominoes puts so many preservatives in those things she'll decay long before it does.  



















 I can't wait for the Pee Wee Herman poster that's a parody of the Under the Skin poster! 









 Do you know anything about self-employment taxes and paypal? 

My question is: Does it count as a Paypal transaction if you transfer money to and from your own bank account?   









 Holy shit! In that case, thank god there are so many spiders in there keeping the mosquito population down! 









 Calling it: This trend will continue until the entire theater industry goes dead for a little while.  




 I don't know why, but the cut to the second camera and crash made me laugh.  




 I'M A FRENCH WOMAN! HA HA HA! French civilian, hi Yanks! 




 Oh yeah? Then why advertise or release the film at all? Shouldn't the only copy of this movie have been destroyed after it was completed and everyone involved forced to sign non-disclosure agreements if it was "all about secrecy?"  




 All the photoshop in the world can't make Ron look cool.  









 How could there possibly be enough insects to feed even a fraction of them?  









 Wait, are you saying there are puppies around? Let me just get my kickin' boots.  




 Unlike your precious pegasus friend, my head isn't up in the clouds.  




 The costs of shipping would be to great for anything bigger than a letter. 
 









 Twist: She's actually Maud's, but Pinkie adopted her. 

Bet you didn't see that coming!
 




 How are red blood cells set to release oxygen? How does it not just sort of build up and over oxygenate certain areas?  




 Doesn't quite capture that magical .MOV shittiness.  









 Huh, all that loaded for me is a C D notice.

 What is a princess but a pair of propellor legs? 









 I don't understand how that kind of bra became fashionable. It looks extremely unnatural and unpleasant.  




 BAAAAAAANNNKKKSSSYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!! 




 Wait, are you saying the truth is you're ugly?  




 Coming up next: His fake trailer for Antman.  

 



















 Yeah. I got a couple messages from people on OKCupid and such. 
I thought they were both unfunny, unattractive people and thought being alone would be better so in both cases I insulted myself at them to destroy their interest in me.  









 I hope not. I vastly prefer my ponies messing about to when they have to go on big adventures.  









 So. Fucking. Awesome! 









 I just wish they'd thought of a more meaningfull way to destroy the library than to have Tirek hit it with a t-shirt cannon so that it fell over a railing.  




 That looks like something a serial killer would make.  









 It's a guy named Grant Thompson with a channel called "King of Random."  




 Guybrush Creepwood.  














 How often have the whales almost killed you? Are there any particularly interesting times this happened? 














 Man, as a neckbeard, the most chugging I was ever able to do was a can of ginger ale in two minutes.  









 I would if I didn't have stuff to plug through social media.  




 Gaspar Noe, definitely.  




 I think the rest of the world except for the studio that lost the money has forgotten this movie already, but Jupiter Ascending could have done with a much lighter touch.  




 I am reliably informed that using the term "friendzoned" makes you an awful misogynist. You clearly brought this on yourself and are not fit to be part of society. 

/s  




 Yes, I'm sure every person who gets a SO is only interested in Fun and Sex.  









 "There are insecure people out there: Let's just pull some insult out of our asses and apply it to them." 
"Uh, how about they're shallow?"
"OH, that sounds good! That makes US sound like the deep ones!"  




 You should see what an owl can do with a go pro strapped on.  




 Nope, they're saying you have a good chance because you'll be willing to date some woman under 5'10". 









 Simon Pegg and Michael Jai White.  









 Do we still hate him and think he's guilty of unspeakable crimes?  



















 So, is this the result of a land mine?  




 I've heard all about the guy because he financed Terry Gilliam's Brazil and such.  









 I have gone to restaurants, bars, clubs, theaters, parks, aquariums, plays, arcades, etc. alone. I have never been asked why I was alone.  














 I'm going to get a heart-shaped pizza, so I'm content.  




 They won't like you. They'll like mooching.
