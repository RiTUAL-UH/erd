 That's pretty cool! :D 




 Yes, thank you! I had a looooot of time between knowing I wanted to get the band and finally getting it so I did a lot of research.

I'm glad you like it! :D 




 He must have been so excited :D 




 I think it comes from the same part of my brain that wouldn't allow any connection with my college students on social media. Educators have to treat these things differently. 




 I work at a museum and I bring my 3DS to collect steps for playcoins on my lunch break basically (and that Pokemon Shuffle fix) and I noticed when I got home I had a streetpass from one of the kids I gave a guided tour to today. SO now I feel a bit creepy but hey at least I got an Eon ticket out of it. xD 




 Aw! Thank you so much! :D 




 Aww gosh thank you so much! I used metallic temporary tattoos I found on Amazon and sealed it with base coat nail polish.

 Thank you! I bet yours are in the mail then eh? 









 I'm bringing a rubber Darth Vader keychain :D

I heard they trade you pins sometimes. 




 Ouch that sucks :( 




 Definitely file a claim with etsy. They are pretty good about getting your money taken care of.  




 It's not broken. It has a superficial scratch that screen protectors would have prevented. 




 Try repairing your download from the eShop settings. It fixed the issue for me! 




 You see the icons on your desktop and think about how to slide them to make the best combo.

Add yours! 




 Sitting on my Diamond and Platinum carts hehe. I have JPN Movie Darkrai, US Movie Darkrai, and the Pokemon Ranger Darkrai. 




 Because I like Munchlax too. It's so hard to choose between favorites! D: 




 Yes Darkrai is awesome! I'd love to see pics of your collection. 3 




 Pokemon X/Y is glorious. You would probably enjoy Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire too. 

I am not a huge fan of Black/White, but I do heartily recommend Heart Gold/Soul Silver and Diamond/Pearl/Platinum. But you don't need them for Pokemon X/Y to make you happy. 




 Yes! :D Darkrai is awesome! :D 




 Dem cicada hands doe.... 




 Yes I did like it, thank you! :D 




 Darkrai FTW :3 I actually used to have two of those holders. Can't find the other one. :/ 




 That's a really good manga though! :) 




 Pikachu actually :3 




 Thanks :D 




 Hehe yeah I was wondering who would notice. 




 Thanks. That would be a nice addition for when Darkrai wants a snack. 




 Eh, not so much. 









 Poke Mac n Cheese always tasted better. My bro and I were convinced the cheese sauce was different, but my adult logic knows that the shapes just held the sauce better than the elbows. 




 Hah you have those little cutouts from the Mac n Cheese boxes. 




 I have heard that having a big combo multiplier helps with catchability. I have not progressed far enough in the game to get to Groudon or Kyogre though. 




 I'm planning on bringing mine to Disney next month :) Good to know I will get lots of passes! 




 Totally! 




 You could use Pokemon for things like that in the Ranger games. It was great. 




 That would be beautiful. :O 




 Definitely. Black was such a let down for me after Diamond. 




 This is adorable. 

^^^My ^^^biological ^^^clock ^^^is ^^^going ^^^CRAZY 




 I've put the most hours into Pokemon Diamond and thought that was the pinnacle of Pokemons, but I just started X and basically it's the Pokemon game I have wanted since 1998 and is amazing. 




 I was tempted to make a throwaway, since the institution I work for is dealing with a potentially hairy NAGPRA claim right now but I have to say that yes I do. I don't know if NAGPRA is the law you are referring to (and I don't have much knowledge of legislation in other countries) but I do support reburial. I also support scientific study of remains. I know from personal experiences that compromises can be made that allow for study and documentation prior to repatriation.

Also, I can't think of a single example where remains in a historic context were not reinterred as soon as practical. Historic cemeteries are always moved if the archaeology is done right. I don't see why this same attitude does not get applied to prehistoric remains that lack a cultural association. They're still people! 




 That's awesome! :D Thanks! 




 Wait wait... I just started Gen VI and you can breed into specific balls now? O_O Too cool! 




 I've really been enjoying Wondertrade. I just got a Helioptile named H-Dawg lmao 




 The bug is usually the one thing I DO evolve haha. 




 Nido FTW 




 I like to keep my starters cute for as long as possible lol. 




 That's a nifty challenge! :3 




 Haha ouch yeah that would be difficult. 




 Yeah those games turned me off too. I'm grumpy that I need to finish my Black that I haven't touched in four years to get Pokes from my Diamond/Platinum/Heart Gold sent up to my new game.  




 Aww :3 




 Nice! Yeah I do the leveling thing too. It kinda threw me off in X when my happier Pokes started getting boosted XP.
 




 And I miss out on Raichu because I refuse to evolve my Pikachu lol. That's pretty cute. :)
 




 So waaaay back in my first Pokemon game (Yellow) one of the members of my team was Nidoking. I didn't have any water types on my final crew I guess so I taught my Nidoking Surf because he could learn it for some reason. Ever since, in FR and HG and just today in X my Nidoking on my team has known Surf. 3

I think my first team was Pikachu, Nidoking, Scyther, Charizard, Articuno ... and someone else. I can't remember the sixth pokemon. ;-; EDIT- Haunter. I think it was Haunter.

What sorts of things do you carry over game to game? 




 They are Banpresto prize plush from 1998 and SUPER RARE! They are called bell plush because they have a tiny jingle bell on them. Laptop for scale. I loves them so much. 3
