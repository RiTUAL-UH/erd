 Big Lebowski, Clerks 2, and Tommy Boy 




 That's kind of what I figured, but thought I would see if there is a possible designation. 




 After going to the Darlington race this past weekend, my friends and I started wondering if there was a difference between the 2 designations for a track.  Most of the tracks NASCAR goes to are noted as Speedways, but there are a few that are Raceways.  Or is it whatever the hell the track owner feels like calling it when they name it? 




 I'd say it affects me for some things.  I prefer to go to Lowe's, but am not against going to Home Depot.  Also, smaller items like certain food products will persuade me more if there's a picture of a driver on the product.  Depending on if I do or don't like them it will persuade my purchase. 




 I THINK EDDIE GOSSAGE IS TRYING TO COMPENSATE FOR SOMETHING WITH THAT NEW BIG HOSS TV! 




 BRAD AND A DIARY?  SO HE'S LIKE ANNE FRANK? 




 Yup.  Saying "Hey" back to this is usually a good response.  The other person doesn't actually care about how you are doing.  They are just using a different phrase to say hi.  Still kind of annoying though. 




 Kind of surprising Josh and Wise aren't each bigger than they are. 




 Nice catch! 




 Where I grew up in the U.S. you never even had to get out of your car to buy alcohol.  We had drive thru carry outs to get that stuff. 




 So you want ooey, gooey, rich and chewie inside.  Soft and golden crunchy flakey outside? 




 DENNY HAMLING USED THE EXCUSE OF METAL IN HIS EYE LAST WEEKEND BECAUSE HE WAS HAVING BAD FLASHBACKS OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR!! 




 I didn't see the pre race, so I don't know what song was played.  But is it possibly [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGBLlFMn9Xc)? 




 In regards to this game, does anyone else have have friends that disagree with the order that the items are said?  As I grew up it was always Rock, Paper, Scissors.  But it seems anyone that is roughly 5 years younger or more order it Paper, Scissors, Rock.  I'm wondering why the change in the ordering. 









 SUMMER AND WINTER OLYMPICS APPARENTLY BOTH PLAY A ROLE NOW. 




 I've got Johnson, Edwards, Keselowski, and Allgaier as my current 4 starters on Yahoo. 




 OSU grad and current employee of theirs here! 




 Norm from Cheers!  Who didn't like him? 




 I think it's just really steep banking. 




 In 2004, 2005 and 2006 there were 5 drivers with a shot at the championship going into Homestead each year.  Unless your talking about pre chase years with multiple drivers having a shot.  That I'd have to look into a bit more to see. 




 You made me go back and check that actually.  Matt Kenseth most likely would have won.  He got 2nd and Jr. got 3rd at Homestead.  But you also have to take into consideration if Jr would have been eliminated after the first round with his engine failure at Chicago. 




 Agreeing with pretty much everyone else that this Chase format is a terrible idea.  But aside from the top 4 drivers going for the championship, are the remaining 12 that were eliminated from the chase essentially finishing in points in relation to where they are to the other 11 eliminated drivers at the Homestead race?  It says when someone is eliminated their total is reset to 2,000.  So does someone eliminated in the first round have their points reset to 2,000 after every 3rd chase race?  




 148 




 18 




 This sounds more like a first place problem than first world. 




 You need to get over the bad things in life.  Shit happens! 




 Thanks for the pictures.  Those seats don't look too bad.   




 Some friends and I are going to the Darlington race in April and will be ordering the tickets in the next week or so.  We are thinking of getting seats in the Pearson Tower section near the top.  So we'd be essentially near the entranace of pit road.  Any opinions on these seats or others?  This is the first time going to this track for all of us. 




 It's amazing how almost all of the stats end with a 5 or a 0 for the amounts. 




 Anyone else read the thank you in Mort's voice from Family Guy? 




 Yup, that's what I would say he is thinking of too. 




 Jimmie! 




 WHAT WHAT IN THE BUTT! 




 IT'S GOOD TO SEE THAT DALE SR. IS RETURNING TO THE CUP SERIES NEXT SEASON IN THE 3....OH WAIT. 




 I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE HIS OTHER IS AND WHAT IT'S DOING. 




 Way better than the actual commercial if you ask me!  Good job! 




 I completely agree! 




 I still think they should have reduced the number that gets inducted each year from 5 to 3.  NASCAR doesn't have the depth within the teams like other sports do in order to have that many people inducted each year. 




 Kyle Larson of course. 




 Aside from the lack of Dale Jarrett, why are all the countdown posts 1 day ahead of schedule?  Isn't today actually 89 days until Daytona 500?  Or am I counting wrong? 




 Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, mother fucker, and tits! 




 He has 4 top 5 finishes in the Sprint Cup series.  So there's that stat.  Don't think any were in the 93 car though. 




 Damn, if I lived in the Charlotte area I'd definitely have to stop by this. 




 Kind of odd that her middle name is the same as her first name though. 




 This is a pretty good idea.  But shouldn't today be 96 days until the Daytona 500?  Edit: Never mind.  I just saw your new post for day 96. 




 Twist, the spotter does speak English, but is British. 




 FINALLY THINGS ARE GOING TO RETURN TO NORMAL WITH OUR CHAMPION BEING JIMMIE JOHNSON AGAIN! 




 It gets me right in the feels. 




 When my friends make fun of NASCAR in regards to gas being wasted I usually bring up MLB teams.  They play 162 games a year and one of the teams has to travel to each game.  How much fuel does it use in a year for all of those teams to travel? 




 My brother bought one about 3 years ago at a garage sale. It's fun because you have to think back circa 1995 for what the answers actually are. 




 YOUR DRIVERS ALL SUCK.  ALL HAIL OUR OVERLORD JIMMIE JOHNSON! 




 YOU JUST WISH IT WOULD COME WITH SPRINKLES ON TOP! 




 People saying they got cheap gas.  Who the fuck cares? 




 And it takes a long time to count that high.  Just counting to [1 million](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Harper) can take 3 months. 




 Thanks.  That's what I figured, but could never find the answer when searching. 




 So I know the scoring for rookie of the year is based entirely different from the points received for the championship.  The highest finishing rookie receives 10 points, second 9, then 8, etc.  On top of this there are points for attempting to qualify, getting a top 10, and a few other things.  Along with this, only the 17 top finishes per rookie are considered for their points.  My question is, out of those 17 finishes that are taken into account, how is a rookies points calculated if that race was a top 17 finish for them, but wasn't a top 17 for any other rookie?  Here's hypothetical example with Ricky and Danica.  Ricky gets 23rd place and Danica gets 25th.  Ricky has 17 other finishes higher than this race so this isn't taken into account for his rookie score.  But for Danica it is one of her top 17 finishes of the year.  Does this then only count for 9 points for Danica?  Of course with only 2 drivers it's not a big difference, but when there's a larger rookie field it would have more of an impact. 




 Dale Jr. asking to [start an interview over](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBhp5xOpXMM) after last year's Pocono race. 




 My brothers and I played the first MTM on N64 all the time.  The king of the hill battles were so much fun. 




 I'd be happier with the dollar. 




 ACTIONS DETRIMENTAL TO STOCK CAR AUTO RACING! 




 DON'T WORRY, JIMMIE WILL REPAY THE FAVOR SOMEDAY....MAYBE....WELL PROBABLY NOT. 




 [SMUG ALERT!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxuwXczWQC0) 




 MYTHICAL...BUTT SEX THAT IS 




 DON'T WORRY, THEY CAN LEARN. 




 COUNTING YOUR OWN FLAIR MULTIPLE TIMES DOESN'T MEAN THERE ARE 4 DIFFERENT USERS. 




 AS ALWAYS, JR CAN'T WIN SOMETHING ON HIS OWN AND NEEDS HIS TEAMMATES TO SANDBAG IT TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE.
