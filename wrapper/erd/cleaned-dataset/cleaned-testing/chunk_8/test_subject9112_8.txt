 Snakes and crocodiles are very efficient digesters - so we would probably look like them - no need to have teeth as the food can be swallowed whole, heads and jaws adopted to swallow objects bigger than the head, no need to be picky as we would eat nearly anything, then survive for months without food. Our social interactions would be somewhat different too, as we do use eating as a way to socialize.
