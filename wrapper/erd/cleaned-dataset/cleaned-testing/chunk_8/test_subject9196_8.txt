 Any opinion on Cruton, any issues worth taking into account? I'm considering buying Pixel LS as it is 700$ cheaper than MacBook Pro (EU here) for Android development so Ubuntu will be my primary OS. 









 Sure it can be, most likely a drawable inside it.
But in this way I avoid most of the problems of for example, keeping size, and detecting text bottom line.

EDIT: you can even find a branch with such Drawable instead of 3 textviews on this repo. 









 Good try of avoiding a pop dialog of Superuser:

 Actually they work in Telegram, and are pretty great (later on you can easily search by some hashtag). 









 Yes, it extracts its RemoteInput correctly, set text, and send it back but Hangouts does ignore that text.
Just tested with Messenger - it works correctly. 




 So I have created sample project with it, and actually it is working.. for every other app except Hangouts (didn't test with other like Messenger).

Probably they require some additional Id or use other way of getting RemoteInput. 




 What tool did you used to decompile? I used 3 different (dex2jar, some online one, and ShowJava app), each time with different results. ShowJava at leasts shows some method in BaseMirror class, that is Wearable related.

"static Mirroring$WearReplyAction a(NotificationSpec var0) {"
but body is invisible due to some error. 




 Sorry, I found it later on (class) but there is still no code for extracting actions as you described.
Here is my BaseMirror class: http://pastebin.com/WDLV5yap
I have downloaded APK from Google Play (not extracted from the phone). 




 I have decompiled latest apk and can't find this class at all (neither "android.wearable.EXTENSIONS") any ideas where is it or what I'm doing wrong? 




 How about Android TV? 




 I'm aware of that - thus I wrote this is (very) small lib. It just save you work of setting up GoogleApiClient. So instead of those 80 lines of code you just wrote around 25. I found it useful in some of my project thus decided to make it a lib.

 Is Yarn open sourced? Or how is this connected to "dev"? 




 Hi, sorry but I don't have knowladge to help you but did you shared your code? Would love to take a look how to write own simple keyboard and there are very few resources with samples. 




 Thank you! I didn't know that one already exists. 




 That lib is solving a problem that not many people are aware of - if you get a exception/crash on Android Wear device it **won't be reported in Google Play** - so you will get many 1 star reviews and no crash reports. 









 Do not forget to add license as well (for public ones at least). 
























 Dev?

 Is there better res of "yes we code"?

Edit: source: https://octodex.github.com/baracktocat/ so it doesn't look like there is one.
