 If I had one of those to wear I wouldn't need to lift.  




 The most important thing I got from this: be considerate of your SO when planning surprises and that they may not be ready for a night of wild sex as soon a they walk in the door. If possible, give them the option to choose.  




 "One bite could feed a man for a week."
"Pippin, how many did you eat?"
"Four." *belch* 




 Yeah, this is probably going to be an unpopular opinion but I'm getting tired of hearing about how introverts are all super special snowflakes that deserve vast amounts of love and care and attention. Especially in the description that extroverts 'take' energy while introverts 'give' it - funnily enough, we're actually people too, not vicious social predators. We also have specific needs and dislike being treated in certain ways. And we give far more energy than introverts - who makes a social event fun, the friendly, talkative person who wants to connect to people and bring them together, or the awkward person sitting silently in the corner trying not to "waste" his precious energy on people who are beneath him? 




 Classic Schmosby 




 This probably doesn't count, but my Skyrim character is a black female. The option to be one is fairly strongly presented.  




 my clothes will probably fit better than women's without tailoring

MFA would like a word 




 IIRC this exact one was in Strauss' book (The Game). 




 I generally pretend they don't exist

TIL I'm super attractive 




 I'm on my phone and can't see tags, so that whole comment was a rollercoaster of possible genders.  




 generally only considered from the male perspective 

Really? I was expecting this thread to be full of men saying how badly they are treated by women because they're unattractive. Maybe I haven't gotten far enough down.  




 What is this, Sexual Achievement Sunday? 




 What's sad is that in the actual picture, the penguin is about to die.  




 Hodor 




 This isn't true. There do exist, unfortunately, truly unattractive women in the world (below the minimum standard of the vast majority of men). While this isn't necessarily their fault, they would have difficulty simply taking any man home.  




 Maybe not aggressive. I would personally be offended by that. But each to their own.  




 Musical theatre is a completely different art form to opera. It's much more accessible for someone who isn't a hardcore theatre fan, and the repertoire is considerably more well known by the public (e.g I Go To Rio from The Boy From Oz, *everyone* has heard that song)

OP, if you tell me what city you live in I can give you recommendations of productions.

EDIT: I might add that the timeframe in which something was composed is hardly an indication of its quality. I know hilarious and highly inappropriate operas with brilliant music, that can easily be compared in entertainment style to a modern comedy movie. Just because the accompaniment is a violin and not a guitar doesn't make it stuffy and awkward like most people seem to think.  




 Well, yes. You know what I mean.  




 I have a feeling that reddit has a higher concentration of these assholes than regular society, simply because they're the kind of dickheads who don't socially fit in anywhere else and retreat to anonymity.  




 One of them is from a guy whose username is I'mWaySmarterThanYou, which is interesting because you got it and he didn't.  




 What's wrong with tshirts? Assuming it's not the only thing they're wearing.  




 Men pretty much never get complimented on anything. So telling him all of these things is far from vanity - it's likely that he hasn't heard someone else say them in a while, if at all. He will be very pleasantly surprised.  




 AFAIK Asperger's isn't something you treat. It's a mental 'disability' (I don't know if that's the proper term and I don't believe it really disables you, so take it with a grain of salt) on the autistic spectrum, which just means that his brain is wired a little differently to that of most 'normal' people. He will have trouble innately understanding a lot of social stuff and human interaction, particularly sarcasm and body language, and may have trouble empathising. As far as being passive or having no goals goes, I think that's something he will have to consciously work to defeat. There's no reason why he can't (but I'm far from an expert so do your research) but he needs to understand first that these are not really healthy traits when taken to that extreme.  




 Yet more proof that everyone's different. So long as it didn't take up time that I needed for something else, I would adore a surprise date.  




 Wow, none of those are symptoms of depression. I would really, seriously look into Asberger's - I know nothing about it but I have a friend with it and he fits most of that criteria.  




 Before we met, he had absolutely no goals whatsoever, no interests or hobbies other than watching TV and playing computer games. He would just go to work at a grocery store (where he still works 8 years later), come home and play games/watch TV until it was time to go to work again.

As someone who has had it since the age of 12, this is *not* the result of depression. Sure it can (and not always) affect your motivation and your ability to focus, but nowhere near to this extent. 

His mental illness is possibly contributing to some serious issues that he already has, not causing them. This guy (I'm sorry, but honestly) sounds like an apathetic loser, who is either using depression as a get-out-of-life-free card or is just completely unmotivated to do anything. There is no reason why he can't have goals and ambitions with depression.

EDIT: Or he has some other additional, possibly undiagnosed, mental illness. Is he medicated for depression at the moment, and if so, how heavily? 




 No one opens by grabbing a girl around the waist. That's not 'attempting kino,' that's suicide. 




 What women want, and what women *think* they want, are two very different things.  




 This kind of discussion comes up in this subreddit on a weekly basis, if not more. Every single time, a guy explains in detail about why we can't share our emotions. Then some chick comes sweeping in with "oh, but I personally just *love* it when guys open up to me! And I'm sure lots of other women do too!"

If they actually did, the problem wouldn't exist. For precisely the reasons you outlined above.  




 must hate Miranda

Am I the only person who doesn't like Miranda? Sure she's a cow sometimes, but so are most people.  




 from romantic partners

- girlfriend is, like most women, attracted to you because you appear confident and self-reliant
- as you become comfortable in the relationship you tell her some of the horrible shit that has happened to you which gets you down, and you seek some emotional support
- girlfriend completely loses all respect for you because you're not 100% made of steel, and leaves you for some brofag with 'more confidence' who actually just has the emotional capacity of a brick 




 Ultimate first world problem: I'm too rich and healthy to get laid 




 And don't feed him after midnight.  




 He did tell her. And he's invited her to come with him at every other occasion that she was going to be present.  




 Fellow Aussie here, keen to see how the US likes us.  




 Are you a dog? 




 It says in the post that all of these except no. 2 are to be done after having talked to them for some time.  




 The PUA is always different from the crowd.  




 IMO masturbating to the thought of someone real is infinitely better than some chick on the internet.  




 You'd think it would be, though. It's not a professional that gets paid vast amounts, so most of the people there are probably the ones who have always wanted to be, and it's creative and in constant communication with new people. Sounds like avert happy job to me.  




 If it was that easy, why do you think it happens so much? 




 Well, in some way or another, the girl in question will also be settling for him. OP is equally unlikely to be perfect, it's just not possible.  




 The Hobbit? Just because it's awesome? 




 Unless there is a better option immediately available.

 IMO girls are different, in that they'd go for the body more than the face even more than guys. But that might just be me.  




 Vocal fry isn't lack of breath support, it's just a different register below your chest voice. By your logic you should hate people who slip into falsetto (which is a lot of people when they laugh).

 Calipers also measure your body fat content, so I guess it could have been a clever pun.  




 I think his definition of gentleman is everyone else's alpha male.  




 How do you feasibly say that you can't have sex with her if she's expecting you to be a typical male horndog? 




 Yep, the adjective 'good' is describing a verb (dancing) so you would use the adverb form 'well.' 




 Find some friends who also have depression. I did, and it was the best thing I've ever done to help myself, because they always understand and are always there to help you. And then you can help them in turn.  




 Before he edited his comment, it said "this guy needs to grow some self esteem balls" 




 Reddit seems to be strongly biased against people with low self esteem, and loves to tell them to 'just respect yourself more.' Holy shit Sherlock, is that what I've been doing wrong all along? Especially when the esteem issue is medical and from a legitimate mental illness like depression, you can't just decide to like yourself overnight, and more importantly - *it's not their fault that they are depressed in the first place.*

It'a like telling someone with cancer to just harden up and get better already, and that if they die then they didn't try hard enough.  




 Seeing as it's supposed to be written in Arabic anyway, does it really matter? 




 Dear lord above yes. There is no reason to ever have pigtails, simply because no matter how good they look, a ponytail will always be better.  




 Too young. Like grade four young.  




 I think the most interesting thing is that most of her 'bitch friends' would have probably said the same thing to you.  




 A girl left a guy because he wouldn't put out? That's honestly the first time I've ever heard of that situation. 

Not that I think it's wrong or anything, people have needs, but considering how our society and gender roles (let's be honest, they still exist, they're just more subtle) work.  




 I think about 10% of people - the really popular and attractive ones - had an amazing time in school. They were the ones telling other people that they weren't so desperate and so on. The other 90% thought it sucked.  




 I'm not sure if I acquired a ponytail fetish because of all the years of school and girls with their hair up, but they make me melt. Every time.  




 Yes, I'm never going to get old! 




 My name is Lorenzo von Matterhorn... 




 "Viruses" - toolbars and freeware 




 I've had several (platonic) female friends say that the best dates they've ever been on have been fun or exciting in addition to the talking.  




 She hates musicals? I can see why she's your ex.  




 For me, in the episode after Bastogne (I think) when the choir is singing and they fade out all the men who died. Heartbreaking.  




 What's worse is when she's attracted to you because you're confident, you begin to trust her and share some of your troubles, and then she no longer finds you attractive and dumps you for not being confident enough. This has happened to me on several occasions. 

Ever since I've believed that women don't actually want men to share their feelings - they *think* they want to because they think that's what a good person should do. They want men to be strong and silent, because that is attractive.
