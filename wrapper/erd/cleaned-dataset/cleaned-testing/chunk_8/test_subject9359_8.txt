i know now that i can't listen to anyone else and to do what makes myself happy.  




 i never did 




 i was thinking of showing my dad this post but then i was thinking about writing my dad a long letter. is that a good idea?  




 i really liked the last sentence you said.  




 theres a lot to say so i will try to say all the information. i don't even know if this is the right sub reddit to write this in. this will put me in bad light but i need all points of view.
i am currently 27. i am a woman. i am british. i was brought up in a sunni gujarati muslim household. my childood was pretty perfect and nothing bad happened. my parents were married but divorced when i was about 17. my dad was a sikh but converted to islam to be with my mum when they were both at school.
my mum started to distance away from islam and is one of the reasons why they split up. my dad got more strict. my mum no longer believes in islam.
i started to have doubts about islam at a different time to do with my mums doubts.
i moved away to go to university and felt conflicted because i wanted to date but felt like islam didn't let me. i started to move away from islam a lot. i became very westernised over a couple of years. i lost my virginity at 21. when it was time to move back to my parents city after finished university i confided in my dad that i had met someone and wanted to see them and maybe move in with them. he was a white non muslim and my dad freaked out. what then happened is i ran away to be with this guy. things settled then my family and parents visited me. my dad straight away told my boyfriend to convert to islam and have a islamic wedding. he didn't want to do that i didn't want him to do that either. we had only been living together for 5 months and known each other for about 8 months. the relationship ended for different reasons.
2 years pass and i get a new boyfriend. he is also white non muslim. i don't move in with him and take it slow. i think he is an awesome guy. i find out through his Facebook that he has extreme anti muslim views and is a member of the uk group edl or english defence league. i like an idiot tell my family and my dad finds out. everyone freaks out. my dad over speaker phone shouts that he is going to hurt my boyfriend and that i need to break up with him and stop seeing him. i shout some hurtful things at him on the phone. he says he is going to get his brother and him and beat up my boyfriend. i say that i am not going to break up with him. things settle down. the boyfriend then dumps me 2 months after all that happens. i move on.
i used to be very close to my dad and we had a lot in common. we both like the same tv shows and movies as we are both very geeky. we like the same type of stand up comedy as well. my dad used to really support me and i looked up to him.
the thing is since me moving away from religion and having boyfriends my dad tries to control me. when i was young he ripped off a good charlotte poster off my wall for having eyes. i used to be a goth and he would tell me not to wear certain clothes because it was promoting satan. i had a skeleton necklace and he tore it off my neck once. once when i was 13 he hit me really bad with a flip flop because i was making loads of noise in the morning and he was sleeping because he had done a night shift on the taxis.
ever since the age of 17 me my brother and my sister would see him on saturdays and get picked up in the car. we would go to the cinema or go to a restaurant and it would be our dad time.
i had facial piercings when i was about 18 and my dad hated them. said i looked ugly.
i became vegetarian when i went to university and when he was shouting at me on the phone and threatening me and my then boyfriend he said something like 'this is just like the time you had the goth phase or the vegetarian phase'
in the past my mum said to him to not mention islam in front of me because i don't believe it anymore and he still did. he went and bought me a book on islam.
ever since the phone call shouting I've been avoiding him. i don't reply to his texts. i haven't talked to him in 2 years now. he keeps wanting to sort things out and fix it but i don't feel safe around him and i don't feel like i can be myself around him.
i am now in a new relationship with a white non muslim athiest. i consider myself agnostic now.
i live with my mum and brother and sister. my dad lives on his own.
i managed to block his texts on my phone but i ended up getting a new phone. my brother ended up telling my dad my new number and has started texting me again. i want him to say sorry but i feel like i don't want to bother with him anymore.
my sister and brother want me to talk to my dad again. they still see him weekly.
when my dad comes in the house i stay upstairs in the bedroom and avoid him. he doesn't come up stairs.
one time i was going out and my dad saw me, he said hey. i said hey. then i just got out of there. i was panicking. I'm scared he might attack me because I'm so far gone from the little girl he used to know. i feel like he doesn't know me anymore.
my dad and my mum no longer talk to each other unless its an urgent matter with there children.
my mum re married a white non muslim and hides it from all her relatives.
should i try and talk to my dad and sort things out? twice before we have had bad arguments over the same thing.
should i keep avoiding my dad?
what else should i do?
any questions you have or advice will be helpful.
i know I'm going to get lots of hate. 




 i know that both of my parents are not perfect but i understand what you are saying.  




 i didn't think of that at all, i will have a think about it  




 also months ago i replied to one of my dads texts and say that i want an apology. no reply. i block him. on my new phone the most recent text says something like 'i want to know what it is i need to apologise for'
