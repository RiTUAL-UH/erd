 When I just turned thirteen I was diagnosed with Merycism, the involuntary regurgitation of food. Slowly I became worse and worse as I was handed off from doctor to doctor, all of them having no idea what to do. I lost 40 pounds from an already-healthy frame and became severely underweight. (Still am in fact.) All my hunger cues disappeared, my enjoyment of anything disappeared and my brain became anorexic before I ended up in the hospital with a feeding tube.

Don't feel better at all since then. I'm coming very close to treatment and I don't even know what the point is anymore. I used to have hobbies, things I was good at, now all I do is browse the Internet all day. I have two people I talk to on a regular basis, only one I know in real life, and the other one thinks I'm someone totally different from who I really am.

I'm also scared to go out in public because my body reacts like an anorexic's to weight gain and makes my stomach distorted (which is the reason I'm avoiding it right now even though I'm still dangerously low).

I'm tired of being sick. I want the old me back. He has to be in there somewhere.

I'm fourteen and I feel like I've gone through all the happiness in my life.
