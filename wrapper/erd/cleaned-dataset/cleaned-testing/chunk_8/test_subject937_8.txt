 Check out /r/augusta 




 Don't listen to this guy. The city has a lot to offer.

In fact, just next week we are rolling out the red carpet for the entire world.

No other city in the state hosts an international-level sporting event like Augusta does. 




 There's really no basis for that assumption. It took thousands of people many years to make change, and against very powerful and stubborn forces in government and the private sector.

And even assuming you are right, millions of people would have suffered in the interim. 




 He was lying. It's really that simple.

These bills have cropped up all over the country, including _last year_ in Arizona. It's absurd to pretend to not know what they're about. He only backtracked when the shit hit the fan. 




 That's a damn easy thing to say on reddit in 2015.

"It would've worked out anyway." 




 You don't have the right to refuse service for _any_ reason (assuming you serve the public). "Pro-war" is a valid, legal reason but "black guy" isn't. 




 You claimed it is wrong for there to be legal penalties for not serving gays. Do you feel the same way about Jews, blacks, women, etc.? The Civil Rights Act of 1964 does _exactly_ that.

Whether you realize it or not, you as a business owner must abide by certain rules. 




 Ever refused someone because they're a Jew?

Edit: Downvote if you'd like but your argument is flawed. Since 1964, you cannot deny service to someone based on various criteria (e.g., race, religion).

What you're complaining about "losing" has been lost for 60 years. And we're better for it. 




 Well, not anymore. 




 And doctors and personal injury attorneys. 




 I think that's a false equivalence. Abortion is not clearly right or wrong like, say, refusing to serve someone because they are black.

If this restaurant said this about a black wedding, I don't think you would compare the outcry to abortion. 




 Is there a term for reverse-click bait? The actual story is so much worse than the headline implies. 









 One man's lazy is another man's efficient. 




 Thanks. 




 Under federal law, private businesses that are open to the public cannot discriminate based on certain criteria (e.g., race, sex, religion).

That is also why those who claim this isn't aimed at LGBTs are full of shit. Sexual orientation and gender identity DO NOT make the list mentioned above (but should). Therefore, the standard protected classes will not be affected by this law because the Civil Rights Act of 1964 trumps state law. This leaves one obvious gap: LGBTs. 




 So you oppose the Civil Rights Act? Why should we go back to the era of "Whites Only" businesses? 




 I'd LOVE to see this feature on Keep. 




 A canned email conveys a voter's opinion as well as a personal one does.

Requiring handwritten, personally-researched letters to our representatives is an excellent way to keep them free from voter input.

Why not let a trusted group do the grunt work? I support this practice (perhaps more so than the alternative because it allows average people to send meaningful input - it's no longer something only for the wealthy or extremely dedicated). 




 And we will fight it next year. And the next.

What we really need to do is defeat Senator McKoon. 




 Have you ever been to Indiana? I go every year for the race and see more Confederate battle flags over that one weekend than I do in Georgia (non-Atlanta) all year. I mean, at least Georgians can try to play the heritage card - just plain racist in Indiana.

Indiana is not some progressive beacon relative to Georgia. 




 It was on the verge of passing until Indiana's blew up in its face. It already cleared the House with flying colors and the governor said he would sign it if the cleared the Senate.

The far right has actually taken control of the Republican party, and gerrymandering means they don't give a shit. It's nuts. 




 And *no one* is buying their bullshit. That's what is interesting. Oftentimes the media will try to do a "both sides" thing but everyone knows it would be laughable to do here. 




 4/1? 




 And that's good, but it shouldn't be the end-all-be-all. If the market thinks something awful should happen (e.g., segregation based on race), it should be ignored.

The government should provide a floor to protect rights when the market fails to do so. 




 I feel like I missed a reddit joke about Gary... 




 Why didn't that work in the U.S. before the Civil Rights Act of 1964? Did the infallible free market fix racism and we just didn't realize it? 




 Right. It's all about _why_. You can't refuse to do business with someone _because_ they are black, Hindu, Mexican, female, Christian, Asian, Canadian, etc. (i.e., if the characteristic is a protected class).

Being a bigot is not a protected class. 




 Do you have a link to the new route? I couldn't find it. 




 Then get rid of limited liability - a gift from the state. 




 Our discrimination bill is still pending... but the passage of Indiana's may have killed it. So... thanks? 




 See, we tried that route (pre-1964) and the free market didn't do shit to stop racism.

So since we tried your way and it didn't work, and the Civil Rights Act *did* make things better, let's use the latter template for gay rights. 




 You have to put up with annoying. I have to put up with denial of services.

You poor thing. 




 Exactly. This issue is as clear as the race issue is. Those who think it's fine to deny services to someone simply because that someone is black are wrong. End of story. 




 A nondiscrimination amendment to the bill passed this afternoon!

Keep calling and emailing! Our voices *are* being heard! 




 Jeez dude. Got any thoughts on women, black people, and Jews? 









 There's a story that in the 60's the CEO of Coke told his friends that if the ticket sales for an event in honor of MLK didn't improve, Coke would consider leaving Atlanta.

I'm not sure if it's true but the general idea of companies helping advance civil rights is not new. 




 Put Harvey Milk on the $20. 




 /u/LouBond is right about the difference, but I can assure you, NASCAR has gay fans. Gay people have always been everywhere. Everyone else just didn't know it. 




 I go to the Indy 500 every year. I'm going to ask every business I go to whether they oppose the law. If they don't, they're sure as shit not getting my gay dollars.

No sitting on the sidelines. 




 The Augusta Chronicle opposes the bill and that says a LOT. The local paper's editorial board is extremely rightwing. 




  nothing is more attractive than a hot chick that doesn't act like a hot chick

No need to stick a gender on this. And although it's not universally attractive, there *is* something appealing about a person who has experienced both being unattractive and being attractive (physically; specifically, necessarily physically - unlike above... on purpose). 




 25

Not hating, just pointing that out. Her results are amazing. 




 I like the idea of asking every single business I go to if I am welcome.

Edit: I could make it a thing. I know someone with Glass. Governor Shithead is a homophobe, but are Indy fans? ... on second thought... 




 I go to the 500 every year. Have since I was 6 and I am 33 now (I missed one year while studying abroad).

What to do? 




 It depends on the level of scrutiny that "sexuality" will receive. The highest level of scrutiny makes most laws very hard to withstand constitutional challenges (e.g., race). 




 Fellow (Internet Smartass) is quite the distinguished position. 




 Bankruptcy... perhaps we should allow student loans incurred to attend a for-profit college to be discharged.

I like it. 









 The pending SCOTUS case is largely over an error in the drafting, not anything substantive.

And do you have a source for your job-killing claim? 




 That hearing was encouraging. The bill was definitely on the defensive. 




 It's interesting to watch rightwing groups attempt to be clever and try to "use" non-discrimination legislation against LGBT people. It only illustrates that they have absolutely no idea what the legislation is for.

It's not about playing "gotcha"; it's about protecting people from discrimination. 









 That's a weird thing with attorneys... It's seen as a sign of being a good attorney if your office looks like a paper bomb went off inside. 




 Jesus those guys are ripped. 




 That's the exact opposite of what the lobbyist who made the front page yesterday said (when asked what the average person should do to counteract money in politics).

Voting does matter. 




 I cried for days... I dunno why and don't care. Bangarang. 




 Excellent attorney. 









 Pbuh = Praise be upon him?

What's the history of that usage? 




 You think all the problems you have are someone else's fault. 




 What was it physically doing? 









 "Homosexualist" is a good hint. 




 They're trying to be "hip" and appeal to "youths". 




 They're trying to be "hip" and appeal to "youths". 




 A constitutional convention isn't an amendment. 




 A law professor put it to us this way: poor grammar will cause your reader to assume - correctly or incorrectly - that the content is poor as well. 




 Credit where credit is due. The paper is right on this legislation. Good job! 









 I don't like it either, but I respect it.

Why? Respecting an opinion that black people are inferior seems odd. 




 I guess I don't see the point. If it is legally the same legal concept, why two different terms? 




 How does changing the term accomplish that? 




 Is it not? My memory leans that way. 




 This will be interesting to watch. 




 That's a fish. 




 Marriage is not just a religious concept. Go look in any law library. There'll be a book or two titled "Marriage".

Switching the terms will literally change nothing and just appeases opponents of marriage equality. 




 A marriage is a "civil union", legally.

Your solution would just require every law book to swap "marriage" with "civil union", which is a waste of time and money for literally no change (except for appeasement of homophobes). 




 I wasn't implying that at all. Both conditions must be met for your argument to make sense. The state must have had Jim Crow laws *and* but for those laws, the businesses would not discriminate.

I am curious if that's something you have research to back up, of if it's just something you think. 




 Your claim is that Southern businesses were forced to discriminate against black people by the government, _and but for that force_, they wouldn't have?

That's a bold claim. Source?

Edit: Modified the emphasis. 




  They are also too ignorant of economics to realize that businesses who discriminate will likely be bankrupt by similar businesses who don't.

Not a big fan of history? Or did I miss where that happened and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was just a precaution? 




 There are lot of legitimate issues with this bill. However, does anyone really think that a judge is going to allow a state RFRA as a defense for wife beating? To refuse Jews lodging in a hotel? Refuse interracial couples?

You left out one group that does not have federal protections (from legislation such as this): homosexuals. Is the possibility of a judge ruling against a homosexual as absurd as you think your other examples are?

Overall, religious freedom is protected by the First Amendment. I don't see what lack of religious freedom this bill is trying to address. It's just hard to believe the uptick in this sort of legislation has _nothing_ to do with the pending marriage lawsuit in the SCOTUS. Doesn't pass the smell test. 




 Haha, no. But I have known him for many years (as acquaintances, not close friends). 




  If it is your business you should be able to do what you want. If people don't like it then your business closes. Yay capitalism. Government has no need to interfere.

Haha, right. That's how history played out. /s 




 Look, buddy. Don't get all mad at me for not fully understanding your position when you jumped down my throat for asking what it was. Good lord... lay off the coffee or something.

You do not support the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (at least to the extent that it requires public businesses to not discriminate based on race). Is that correct? 




 I had heard of some churches getting sued for not solemnizing weddings.

Do you know from where? That sounds like something that would pop up on a Facebook feed from "that uncle". 




 Why so hostile? I've simply asked you two questions (in a respectful manner).

You agree that businesses should be required to serve black people despite their religious objections. Why do you have a different opinion regarding homosexuality? 




 So your answer to my question is "yes"? 




 Do you think a business should be able to refuse service to black people because the owner's religion says that blacks are inferior? 




 At least Wal-Mart is increasing their minimum wage. The jobs are still low paying but not as low as they could be. 









 I haven't worked with him but know him personally. He has a passion for Augusta. Coupled with his youth, I think he is what Augusta needs. 




 That top is fucking hot. 




 Yeah. 




 That seems like a viable argument to me. 




 The election for the commissioner of District 7 is this Tuesday. Please vote! Turn out will be low so your vote will have a lot of weight.

For what its worth, I'm voting for Frantom. He's dedicated, committed to Augusta, and has a good head on his shoulders. 




 01/00

Edit: January 0, 2015; 2015-01-00. We can make this work. 




 This look like walking in dreams feels. 




 So, as everyone suspects, it's the gays who get fucked.

Edit: And not to mention, it would take a lawsuit to resolve the issue definitively. Prior to that, the lack of clarity would cause real harm as warned. 




 C?

If B and C wore the same color, D would know that his hat is the other color. So if D remains silent after 10 minutes, C knows that his hat is not the same color as B. As C knows that B's hat is white, C's hat must be black. 




 Is that where it cuts through the mountains prior to reaching the Black Sea? 




 16 year old test_subject937 rejoices!

The timing is funny. It used to be where the new CookOut is going in on Washington Road. Nothing has been successful since Fazoli's left, but I'm sure CookOut will be.

The Curse of Fazoli's is finally about to be lifted and they're coming back! 




  it is not so on its own under Federal Law unless the legislature also supports it with their own actions/resolutions/laws.

This is not true of all executive agreements. If the executive agreement was entered into by the President pursuant to his enumerated or inherent constitutional authority, it has the force of federal law (and will supersede conflicting federal law pursuant to the "Last in Time" rule). 




  Executive Agreements cannot have the force of Federal Law unless approved in the Senate by another, separate resolution. 

Wrong. That is just wrong. I have already cited _the Supreme Court of the United States_ to prove you are wrong. Care to cite a case in opposition? 




 Um, no. You're the one making this a partisan issue. I am simply explaining how the legal process works (regardless of what political party may be in charge). 




 What? Did you read what I wrote? Government has a monopoly on violence, and all legal orders (and therefore our entire system of law) ultimately rest upon the threat of force to comply.

That's why if you ignore a civil judgment, the party you lost to will show up at your house with a sheriff and enforce the judgment by taking your property. If this _wasn't_ the case, judicial orders and the rule of law would be meaningless. 




 I was referring more to the end game, legally (assuming the Kochs can be compelled to testify):

Congress subpoenas, Kochs fight them, Kochs lose, Kochs refuse to comply, U.S. Marshalls show up with guns to drag them into court. If they "fight back" against the marshalls by hiring mercenaries or something crazy, they will ultimately lose because tanks. 




 That sole executive agreements cannot have the force of federal law, or overrule Congress. If the subject matter is the prerogative of the President, they can (and I have already provided a source for this).

Between you, a nonlawyer, and the Supreme Court, I'll go with the latter... 




 You're just moving the goal posts now.

You originally quite clearly said that executive agreements cannot have the force of federal law (i.e., "No. They. Do. Not"). I provided specific case law from the Supreme Court showing that you are wrong.

You're trying to back peddle now by saying "most" have congressional input. That wasn't your original claim at all.

You're also now admitting you're not an expert, which I take to mean you have no legal training. I do, including studying international law in the U.S. and abroad. You're understanding of the law here is simply wrong.

Edit: And for crying out loud... the paragraph immediately before the first you cited contradicts your point. Don't selectively quote, please. 




 Seriously, /u/Silidistani, quit repeating incorrect information.

You have so far failed to respond to the congressional report (with case and statutory citations) I have sprinkled all over this thread. Your understanding of the law in this field is not complete - surface at best. 




 No, he actually isn't. Please see the congressional source I have posted repeatedly. His sources are Wikipedia and ehow.

Edit: Does that guy have a law degree?

 That is a definitional argument. Big "t" Treaties are pursuant to the Treaty Cause; small "t" treaties aren't. That is the only meaningful difference.

International law makes no distinction between the two; only U.S. law does. A U.S. President signing a sole executive agreement pursuant to his authority as C-in-C is no less a treaty than one ratified by the Senate.

And, by the way, a statute is only as good so long as the sitting Congress wishes it to be (generally). It is no surprise that lawmaking is dependent upon lawmakers.

 Sure. I found a good source and responded above. I'd need to do more digging for a more comprehensive response (tomorrow and not on a tablet) but I can assure you s/he does not fully understand the law.

Edit: It's now below.

Edit2: May be wherever soon so [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t source=web rct=j ei=IlMCVbWoBc32gwTy6IPwBw url=http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32528.pdf ved=0CDAQFjAG usg=AFQjCNE_0ryx2ClehZ7q_isyd4Gx6BWBxA sig2=sgtAFQ3TkUwDbnEX478lCw) [PDF download] 




 You are just simply wrong on the law. It's been about a decade since I took International Law but [here's](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t source=web rct=j ei=IlMCVbWoBc32gwTy6IPwBw url=http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32528.pdf ved=0CDAQFjAG usg=AFQjCNE_0ryx2ClehZ7q_isyd4Gx6BWBxA sig2=sgtAFQ3TkUwDbnEX478lCw) [PDF download] a good resource I found that should blunt your certainty.

That is a congressional report with case citations, not an ehow page. There are sections that address each of your points, I think.

Edit: Here's the footnote refuting your claim that sole executive agreements cannot have the force of federal law (in italics):

Executive agreements have been held to be inferior to conflicting federal law when the agreement concerns matters 
expressly within the constitutional authority of Congress. See, e.g., United States v. Guy W. Capps, Inc., 204 F.2d 655 
(4th Cir. 1953) (finding that executive agreement contravening provisions of import statute was unenforceable); 
RESTATEMENT, supra footnote 1, 115 reporters n.5. *However, an executive agreement may trump pre-existing federal law if it concerns an enumerated or inherent executive power under the Constitution, or if Congress has historically 
acquiesced to the President entering agreements in the relevant area.* See Pink, 315 U.S. at 230 ([a]ll Constitutional 
acts of power, whether in the executive or in the judicial department, have as much legal validity and obligation as if 
they proceeded from the legislature) (quoting The Federalist No. 64 (John Jay)); Dames   Moore, 453 U.S. at 654 
(upholding sole executive agreement concerning the handling of Iranian assets in the United States, despite the 
existence of a potentially conflicting statute, given Congresss historical acquiescence to these types of agreements).

In other words, if it is a constitutional prerogative of the President, his signature alone can be binding. And you don't get much more Presidential than foreign policy. 




 Hooray!, internet stranger! 




 Yep. As Frank Underwood said: "You may have all the money, but I have all the men with guns." 




 Yes they are. And, yes, Congress can override some with legislation (overriding a veto if necessary).
