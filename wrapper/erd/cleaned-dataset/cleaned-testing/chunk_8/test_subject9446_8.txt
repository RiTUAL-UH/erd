 Dog is lucky he didn't flush... 




 Fallout 3 was my first introduction into RPGs, and I loved it. Open world, play your own style at your pace.
I had just been a purely FPS player prior to that, but now I'm broadening my genre horizons... 




 As a long-time lurker, I was just here to browse content and chuckle at witty comments. I've decided to change my ways and attempt to become more involved in the community.

We'll see if I regret it... 




 Assuming it took an hour to cut the grass, that's about $0.16/hr. 









 Better safe than sorry... 




 It's missing for me as well.

Instructors, any update on this? 




 It's not listed on the course site and it was not clear in this week's intro video when the due date was for the midterm.

Is it due by this weekend or the next? 




 Same issue here as well...
D9 Quiz is not present, and the first answer on D8 isn't related to the subject matter.

Is there an estimate on when these quiz problems will be resolved? 




 I noticed the same thing, and it seems to only be with the Webgoat demo videos. I thought perhaps they just didn't have audio to begin with... 




 I solved this by changing the port WebGoat was running on from 8080 to 80:

java -jar WebGoat-6.0.1-war-exec.jar -httpPort 80

For whatever reason Burp didn't like forwarding to localhost:[port] 




 I'm attempting the "Path Based Access Control" lesson on WebGoat, but when using Burp as a proxy I'm not able to use WebGoat. Any attempts to load a page (before or after intercepting) result in the following errors in Burp:

"Timeout in transmission from localhost"
"Timeout in communication with remote server"

All other webpages work just fine. I'm only having this issue with WebGoat on localhost. My configurations are below:

- WebGoat is running on localhost:8080
- Burp Proxy is configured to listen on 127.0.0.1:8081
- Firefox is configured to use the Burp proxy.

I've spent several hours Googling and tweaking the configurations, but I have not been able to get it to work. Any help would be appreciated. 




 It's mistaken coded as a relative URL. Here, try this:

 It turns out he's a suspect in a burglary :-/ [Source](https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/usc-cb-josh-shaw-admits-he-lied-about-heoric-act--retains-a-lawyer-230956759.html) 




 The apartment that was broken into was on the 3rd floor and had a balcony, and the suspect was seen jumping off this balcony.

 Since no one else wants to go there, I will.
STDs. 




 Damn it. Beat me to it... 




 Gotcha. So, by not vaccinating, you not only put yourself at risk, but everyone around you, and you do all of this for a weak "maybe" of a risk.

Doesn't seem worth it at all. 




 Yes, I've seen many references to mercury being potentially implicated in this, so you make a good point. 




 Thanks! Just did :) 




 My parents are anti-vaccinations, and I've been trying to educate myself on the matter so that I could address and potentially counter their concerns knowledgeably.

I know Reddit is quite pro-vaccine, and I hear all the time about the flawed and debunked autism-vaccine study. I watch Penn and Teller's Bullshit episode on vaccines, and I see people "poo-poo" any casual connection between vaccines and autism.

But then I come across a site like [this](http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-evidence-of-any-link.html), and I become confused. It appears to be heavily cited, with over 60 papers and studies that present a connection between various types of vaccines and ADS (austism spectrum disorder).

There seems to be misinformation on this topic everywhere, and it can get a little overwhelming. Reddit, can you help me sort out fact from fiction, speculation from science?

*EDIT* Whoops, forgot to include link
 




 This is great, thank you! I'm not one to take a blogger or even a study at face value, but I sometimes have a difficult time taking apart the research process like you did.

And those are great resources, I'll definitely be bookmarking those for thorough reading :) 




 I understand, but even if we assume that one is completely safe (which isn't the case) that's only a single vaccine. There are studies linking autism to the Hepatitis B Vaccination, for example.

I guess I'm just wondering if vaccination simply becomes a question of risk tolerance? "Am I okay with with the rare but possible side effects of this vaccination?" 




 Okay, so would you agree it's a case then of risk assessment? Not all vaccines are for potentially fatal diseases. 









 "If you visit a link on one computer, itll show up purple across your other computers."

Will this also be the case for mobile apps? This would greatly improve the efficiency of my toilet based reddit browsing. 




 I hope it's mandated to use these new server names in conversation as well.

"Oh shit, Titty-Sprinkles is down again" 




 Really? Where are you getting that from? According to Wikipedia:

"Lyrically, "Daughters" is an admonition to fathers (and to a lesser extent mothers) to nurture their daughters in their childhood, because the relationship will affect their future relationships with men as adults."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughters_%28John_Mayer_song%29 




 I...I never noticed that. 




 So 6AM is the optimal time to misbehave then?
