 Sometimes things come down so perfectly to Reddit's impulses that it has to be load of shit. This was one of those times.

 The Supreme Court kinda took a giant shit on their parade by finalizing bafflingly contentious rights. Now they can't smugly gloat that marriage is just for hetero relationships.

 [James Horner did this film for free. He actually paid it out of his own pocket because he loved the father-daughter relationship.](http://www.npr.org/2015/07/17/423899444/in-portrait-of-a-boxer-fuqua-takes-the-action-outside-the-ring)

Southpaw is the last recorded Horner score before the plane crash, the last released score will be for "The 33." 

But Horner actually did something really beautiful. James Horner's team had actually brought Fuqua the completed written score for The Magnificent Seven. You can actually hear in the interview that Fuqua was really touched by Horner's gesture because he didn't do it for money. He just did it because he loved the script. 

It's incredibly touching to hear these stories, especially from Fuqua who you can hear get choked up about it, and hopefully we'll be able to hear Horner's final score.  




 Man, these guys would be real surprised to read George Orwell's Marxist critiques of [Charles Dickens.](http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/dickens/english/e_chd) 



















 He's supported liberal views in the past, I sternly believe he's in it to destroy the Republican party. 




 I hope someone buys the rights to the movie version of that slapfight.  




 Nearly all of today's luxury food started out as peasant food, in fact that's a whole side of high-end French cuisine today. The truth is, we do live in the real world today and lobster is expensive and appreciated as a treat. To throw it in a shitty bun and slather it in crappy tinned dry seasonings and mayo is just a waste because any of the other lesser meats would suffice. That you people can't grasp that is just... pathetic and nationalist, as always.

I wonder if this guy tries his material out on his mom before typing it into Reddit. 




 You know who owns the land ends that are just before the ends of the earth? Sheldon Adelson. He's trying to hide it from the rest of the world, but i know his plans. It's to build The World's End casino and bar and grill. You can't fool me JIDF and Land's End outerwear. I know you'r taunting me.  




 Are they planning of kicking government off the edge of the Earth?  




 I wonder what stopped him from going *over* the borderline to genius level.  




 I can only venture to guess that the guys downvoting were probably guys.

 The word offensive doesn't have a definition that everyone agrees on because different things offend different people. It's easy to ruffle people's feathers.

Once, a friend told me about a situation he observed in which a white customer at a grocery store dropped some change into the palm of a black clerk while paying for his food. The black clerk looked the customer straight in the eyes and said, loudly enough for people nearby to hear, "it doesn't rub off, you know."

The black clerk felt put down because she felt that the white customer was avoiding touching her because of her race. That may have even been true, but maybe he was a germophobe and treated everyone that way, or maybe he didn't like touching other people, or maybe he was just being careless because his mind was on other things. We don't know.

The thing is, the customer had no options. He couldn't stand up and say, "excuse me, everyone who just saw that? Could I have your attention? I just want to let everyone know that I'm not a racist," because that would make him look even more like a racist.

In this way, people who are members of groups that are subject to prejudice have a special power to try and convict people in the court of public opinion. They may be sensitive or insecure in ways that are not readily apparent, and there are no defenses available to people who are perceived as members of dominant, majority, or privileged groups.

This happens all the time. Look at male students who have been expelled from universities due to rape allegations without evidence (or even contrary to evidence) for example.

Because society works this way, it can be more dangerous for people who are perceived as privileged to interact with people who are perceived as unprivileged, so I would say that OP has successfully avoided a negative result in what can be a dicey situation.

 THEY'RE THE SAME!?!?!?!?!  




 I've never been to carl, jr. although the biggest best burgers in that bracket of fast food burger is hardees. fucking hardees is great. 




 I never usually see this drama without Robotics man in there. But here he is again. It's like a moth to flames.

I love when negative posts get gilded. The salt comes out. 




 Chipolte is great, but the one thing I never got is the whole "it'll ruin your asshole" thing. I never took any massive shits, but it's a meme whenever Chipolte comes up.  




 I usually ask for half of the rice and double up on the meats. Sometimes I just want a burrito and there's something satisfying about the fact that their ingredients are pretty fresh, you can watch them grill all that shit too, and it all just tastes really good. The guac is pretty fucking stellar. Usually, I just go for guacamole and dip. 




 Lol. Google is so passe. I use this cool thing you've probably never heard of called the phone book. All the cool kids are using one. 




 They've internalized memes. They're meme masters. 




 ad hoc pork bone chop hoc of beef. 




 Classic Ad Hom. Classic.  




 Gillette Razor. I'm smooth. *All over* 




 Classic ad hom. Totally classic ad hom. 




 No Jew Not.

 I thought Redditors shit the bed on the Ellen Pao debacle and the guys who run Reddit are trying to out do them by eating a jar of stool softener before shitting the bed. 




 The admins really need training in dealing with customer service. They act like they're part of the rabble.  




 It's going to blow up in his face. Once the moderators see how unmanageable trolls are and they find that they can't actually get rid of them, they're going to either shut down the subs or leave. 

They do it for free and Huffman is literally out there saying, "I'd like to make your jobs harder because I want to read dipshit comments. You no longer have the ability to control how you want your sub to be."

 The biggest problem is that he assumes Reddit is filled with inherently good people willing to bring good discussion to the table. Boy, is he really barking up the wrong tree. 




 I'm pretty sure Steve Huffman is a plant from Facebook to destroy Reddit. 



















 He probably would have been better as the replacement for the Daily Show or maybe a Bill Mahar type round table. 




 God, it's like the worst of Christopher Nolan's scripts just up and came to life and re-arranged themselves into a Frankenstein Dylan Thomas knock-off. 




 Buzzfeed made 100 million last year. Reddit's profit? Just about 8 mill.  




 I, uhhh, can I get on this deal? 




 *Says there's no battle lines

*Goes to KiA

*Everyone is describing shit like All Quiet on the Western Front 




 How much was the budget for ant-man related clothing? 10 million? 




 When I first copied it, he didn't have any line breaks. That's in the archived version. I like the way it is now. It preserves the "original intent." 




 It's the one from Star Trek. I'm having a hard time believing anyone in KiA has a good sense of history anyhow. 




 bait shop? 




 Proving my point, how does this prove in any way shape or form that I am a man baby? What even is a man baby? Someone who wears a diaper on Tuesday nights? Someone who is 27 and watches adventure time while high? Someone who whines a lot ("there are not enough hours in the day")? Ignorant how? Do you claim to have a fair and unbiased viewpoint of both sides? I personally know LGBT people have a shit time, T and B especially (I don't we should place value on how bad certain individuals have it, more of the whole whining about life deal) but we are gradually getting better and the best thing for that is positivity, not negativity and captious behavior. I am not gonna sit and let people tell me that we are getting worse or that there is nothing we can do except point out flaws.

This is the best thing I've read today.  




 If you can't separate someone's actions from their identity and then have the gall to claim any criticism is harassment then you are a miserable excuse for a rational person. Laurlai was the reason this sub was created, because social justice hypocrites were drawing to much hate for lgbt folk with their rhetoric. when your claim to being trans gendered, bi, or homosexual is because of make believe genders or because you want to gain victim status for immunity it's despicable. These people remove all agency from women, telling them that they are helpless without feminism and that they can't be free to express their sexuality (in most cases referring to heterosexuality) without indirectly harming others. They believe that all their own problems stem from society and they have zero self awareness. It is possible that Anti GG's and third parties have posed as gg'ers to stir shit, and there are bad apples among the gg'ers that may have done the same, nobody knows. But GG's mission is to end the sexist, bigotted, and perverse overcompensation for historical discrimination that society has already deemed despicable and was moving away from that is perpetuated by SJW types. The racism towards white people that gets ignored because somehow somewhere it was decided that institutional racism = racism and that apparently there never was a society that enslaved white people (ignoring thousands of years of history, for example the Khan dynasty, germanic peoples, Moors, Celts, Greeks, fuck just about everyone has been enslaved or enslaved someone else). It also claims that preferences tacitly belie discrimantion no matter what (even if sometimes it may be that way you can't really prove that and it does not cause significant harm) and that any figure couldn't possible be criticized for any reason besides racism/phobia/sexism. The struggles of victims are stolen for the sake of pointing out how evil society is. Their irrational claims draws negative attention and encourages those that had some small amount of sexism/homophobia/etc. to justify it ("oh that crazy femnazi dyke bitch trying to tell me what to do lol" or any other sort of reaction it might cause). I personally know teens my age that will say sexist shit just to rile up our local hoard of self loathing teenage girls and people think it is hilarious. This bullshit makes a mockery of all feminism/rights movements and prevents focus on actual issues. Doxxing and harassing those who defy you're narrative is a despicable course of action. And if you think my rebuttal is harassment, you're a fucking joke and lack emotional maturity. Hurt feelings are not grounds for outcry. I will not stand for perverted identity politics that will make a world where Frozen is racist, gay men are sexist, sex is rape, any feeling of regret is rape, sex involving two intoxicated members of opposite sex puts that man in prison, women who rape are celebrated or go unpunished, living unhealthy is praised, and where criticism is tantamount to violence. I do not want draconian censorship of humor and insults that are even remotely offensive, that would be a rather joyless world. 1984 was a warning but social justice hypocrites treat it like a manual for running the world.
Edit: to the people who downvoted, does that really make me wrong? that you disagree? That the number is proof? Care to defend yourselves? No? That's right, because almost everything you got is illogical or a conclusion drawn from bias without being well informed.

Extra nugget: 

They criticizing a movement that wants to eliminate disagreement and dissent that doesn't adhere to their beliefs. Orwell specifically decried this. I don't know how you have so massively misunderstood his views on societal structure. He is against oppressive practices that he clearly defined. Reactionary is a poor choice to describe GG. I could say all SJW's are reactionary, they see something they decide is not right and let everyone know. Face it, we're both mud rakers here. Fuck stains doesn't leave me with any constructive feedback so I'll move on. The sjw movement absolutely has elements of 1984, doublethink, careful scrutiny of all media for ideas that don't conform, and the desire for indoctrination.

One last one:

Proving my point, how does this prove in any way shape or form that I am a man baby? What even is a man baby? Someone who wears a diaper on Tuesday nights? Someone who is 27 and watches adventure time while high? Someone who whines a lot ("there are not enough hours in the day")? Ignorant how? Do you claim to have a fair and unbiased viewpoint of both sides? I personally know LGBT people have a shit time, T and B especially (I don't we should place value on how bad certain individuals have it, more of the whole whining about life deal) but we are gradually getting better and the best thing for that is positivity, not negativity and captious behavior.

It's a gift that keeps on giving:

Is politics being in games necessary? It happens in other mediums sure, but not nearly to the degree that you would like for games. Why are violent games a problem? The install base of violent video games compared to those who have committed violence in the name of games is monstrous. They aren't even comparable.

Our society for milennia has been extremely sex negative, and even your side will decry "slut shamers" Sexuality is a part of who we are and lots of innocuous things can and have been sexualized. Do you think the new Miguel album is grossly sexualized? He writes about his heterosexuality in an overt way that's at times self loathing, indulgent, and identifies his desires. I wouldn't expect someone who doesn't analyze music to immediately get it. Wildheart is a fantastic album, critically acclaimed and everything. Why focus overtly on video games/tv/movies? Mad Max wasn't a political statement, it was just good writing. You are confusing politics with being socially conscious. Content creators are free to express political beliefs but their content must also be more than a platform for their beliefs. Sunset comes to mind, it wasn't a game, but I will give the premise credit. It could have been a short film, which could have been well received but it tried to be a game for "real gamers" that lacked gameplay. 




 So he made a community about people being "bigots" toward racists and those people are the *real* bigots?

 KING JAMES HAS ARRIVED. 




 He seems more like a wet noodle.  




 I'm waiting for Yishan to infiltrate Reddit from the inside once again. Yishan gets hired as a "consultant" and three months down will frame Steve Huffman by putting nude photos of dogs having sex with plushie dolls and then take over the CEO position and nuke this site from the sky while Back in the Saddle plays.

I don't think Steve Huffman is as strong a leader to get Reddit monetized and bring in users. And he's too much of a wet noodle to decide on what to ban. Even his purge picks were like, "Yeah, okay. This one is obvious, but this one will be over there, I gueeeess." 




 The URL is hilarious by the way.

 Stenley kubrcik died for our memes. 




 Limn is trying to stile our creation of memes. its in the constitution that we have freedom of memes. 




 I was briefly subbed to /r/MadMaxGem. Made a post, some comments, etc. And unsubbed within a week. The MoviesCirclejerk guys were choking out any discussion. They commented on nearly everything people said to mock and demean. **It seemed to be only two or three** really dedicated trolls, but christ, what a shitshow. 




 Dredd wasn't even on the list. What the fuck is this amateur hour?  




 I recently graduated and wrote my thesis paper on cult films. My actual paper, however, wasn't up to my personal par because I was typing it in a drugged stupor from a hospital bed in order to graduate on time, so I figured I'd try and not waste months of research and put my knowledge to good use! Let me know if you like this, because I have 8000 more things to say (ex: the history of cult, what defines "cult status", cult vs. cool, the new rules of cult in the internet age, **why I hate Quentin Tarantino,** etc.), or I could talk about specific films, too.

EDGY 









 I hope we get to see that guys surgically larger dick or this money will have been for nothing.  




 Apparently, mocking individuals is only reserved for bon vivants of the highest caliber over at Kotaku in Action. No one can understand the deep wells of meaning behind their famed sense of dignity. 




 You posted a Deadline article saying that this is empirical evidence that he's doing something akin to throwing out the first draft.

Jon Spaihts is writing Doctor Strange.

That's your statement saying he's writing it, not "re-writing" it. Either way, I don't know what the fuck we're talking about. Three guys have put in work on the screenplay and that's that.  




  The first draft of the Doctor Strange script was penned by Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer.

Exactly, he's rewriting it. This isn't proof that he's throwing out the entire first draft.  




 We don't actually know what he's doing or whether he'll be keeping material from Donelly and Oppenheimer. You really can't empirically say that you know he'll be throwing away their entire work.  




 Not by much. A lot of his scenes were left in. The major changes by Lindelof and Scott were done by the studio; No Xenomorphs, the pod sequence was changed, the ending was a little more open, and the love making sequence doesn't end with a xenomorph popping out. 

The only change I think would have made the film better was if David did follow through with believing he was an heir to the engineers and not having the black goo sequence. Other than that, his delusions are a little unexplained. The scene that was removed about Shaw and David with the facehugger had the potential to be extremely corny.  




 So are Thomas Dean Donelly and Joshua Oppenheimer. 




  Jon Spaihts

You're gonna have a hard time convincing me that the same writers as Dylan Dog: Dead of Night and Conan the Barbarian (Remake) and the writer of The Darkest Hour and one half of the team that wrote Prometheus is not some sort of unholy alliance made in hell.  




 r u a bettr fathr now? 




 [Here's the interview](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/movies/anthony-and-joe-russo-on-captain-america-winter-soldier.html?_r=0)

They were a bit shocked he went there. 




 Can't wait for another movie about Rosemary Dewitt doing Rosemary Dewitt things.  




 James Vanderbilt also wrote the fantastic satire cum 80's wet dream action movie White House Down.  




 "Spider Man...listen right cause he's the great part...tries to kill his boss at the Daily Bugle, but he doesn't know how...stop me if you've heard this one *big grin* okaydon'tstopmeifyou'veheardthisone...but then he's friends with Harry Osborne who ALSO works at the Daily Bugle. And together they try to kill their boss in wacky ways. Wahoo how'd ya like it!?"

"Get out of here, Mr. Trump." 




 My favorite question lobbed at the Russo brothers was during the press tour for The Winter Solider and Brooks Barnes straight up said, "Why should we forgive you for You, Me and Dupree?" 




 The same writers as Dylan Dog: Dead of Night and Conan the Barbarian (Remake) are writing Doctor Strange. Basically Marvel struck out twice. 

John Sayles apparently is a great writer because his ideas survived long enough to get into Jurassic World. Get him.  




 All of those movies. Instant classics. They belong in the Criterion Collection. Each one. 




 Except for Batman V Superman. Then it's okay. And Suicide Squad. I'm willing to be advertised to about suicide Squad. And Doctor Strange I want Doctor Strange ads all over my body. 




  Somewhat off-topic, but where does the idea that Girls is somehow an accurate portrayal of the millennial generation come from?

Because Lena Dunham proclaimed on the first episode that she's a "voice of a generation" and everyone just went with it. It speaks to some sub section of "millennials" who find that self destructive attitude much like their own. 




 At least it was better written than the potential Donald Trump memoir: "I'm better than you. You know it and you're a dummy. Look at my Billions. TEN BILLION DOLLARS" 




 I don't understand his complaint either.

"Oh, yoooooooou hippies. If you're gonna come here then just stand at the city limits and proclaim your guilt before entering this dead city. You should feel bad from taking it away from honest people."

From all the news out of Detroit, it sounds like the honest people either died, were killed, or up and left. Why the fuck does anyone need to answer to that guy? Living in a city isn't a badge of honor. He's not Joseph Mitchell, patron saint of the working class, either.

But this line was priceless:

Thats the rub. Thats what gets me, because weve lived here in Detroit all this time and we know how to get along here.

Not long enough to save that city from bankruptcy apparently.  




 I'm fucking loving this Highline shit they got there. The Huffington Post is an un-navigable mess. It's nice they just decided to clean it up and put all the good shit somewhere else.  
























 Uhhh..the headline on NY Times front page was the shooters life was ["Short and Bitter."](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/us/chattanooga-shooting-suspect-was-ordinary-boy-neighbors-recall.html?hp action=click pgtype=Homepage module=b-lede-package-region region=top-news WT.nav=top-news) 




 So this is the excuse for bad costume design?  




 Rights to license the music probably cost them the rest.  




 Reddit MD is on the case. lol. It's just like how Cringe always tries to diagnose that one kid from the Minecon 2013 video as autistic. 




 "So that's it, huh? We're just some kind of Guardians of the Galaxy tribute band." - Will Smith 




 Yishan: The internet's greatest hype man.  




 I've seen pictures of the look they're going for, but honestly I wish some costume designer went, "Are we really going to build an action movie around sexy vampire costumes?"

The Days of Future Past tactical costumes were much better. The thing here is that it just doesn't make Psylocke look very intimidating.  




 This was on /r/videos. Someone probably thought this would make it in this sub. Ya'll are upvoting it.  




 No, he's not my Jonas. He's Joe Jonas. 




 Isn't this indicative of all the X-Men movies starting with First Class? They have the production values of a TV show along side giant CGI million dollar spectacle. I'm not even buying Olivia Munn's costume. It just looks like "Sexy Vampire" from a Halloween outlet.  




 He is. Right now he's the only credited writer on the project.  




 Resurrection was fun. Also, Ron Perlman. 




 It used to get play all the time on Cartoon Network. Then CN became the network of adult stoners and they moved all the Chuck Jones-Hannah Barbera stuff to Boomerang. 




 What about all them trigger warnings for spider posts?

 [IT"S STARTING CEO VS EX CEO](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/ct5xle4) 




 America went to war in Iraq because their games journalism ethics was unethical. It was right there behind GWB when he said mission accomplished.  




 KiA mods literally post a XCDC image post re-edited about changing ones argument to fit their views and then here it is happening. A degree of self-awareness would go a long way for those people. 




 Steve Huffman is a wet noodle confirmed.  




 Everyone died for this.  




 Never forget the black guy on a scooter in Wal-Mart video. /r/videos was just piling on with stormfront shit. 




 /u/spez by making an AMA is currently proving the AskHistorian mods right one wall of text at a time in that announcement thread.  




 It might trigger him. 




 In such short time as well. I wonder if they'll start to copyright their angry rants and demand royalties.  




 "It is sophistry to re-define your opponents arguments, it might feel good, but so can jerking on a subway" 

Says the guy re-defining an argument. Jeezus, KiA get yer shit together. 




 **THEY'VE BEEN TRIGGERED** 




 TunicSong laying the fucking smackdown. beautiful. 




 Apparently it's a-okay to Steve Huffman as long as you tell the biwg bawd meanie weenies that their sub is a weally bad place to go. That wasn't going to stop them from seeding and colonizing other areas of the site. Huffman done fucked up big time. 




 YISHAN PROMISED HEADS WILL ROLL. I WAS TOLD HEADS WILL ROLL! 




 [Coontown is rejoicing](http://gawker.com/reddits-most-racist-community-rejoices-as-new-ceo-says-1718353537) 




 Wow, does that guy have proof or did he shit that one out because he knows the inner workings of the upvote system? 




 Reading the "reclassified" terms was a pussy move. God, such a fucking disappointment. And the media is gonna kick him in the tits about it till he breaks too.   




 People are really desperate to keep ShitRedditSyas and really desperate to keep Coontown. I'm waiting for Yishan to go fucking ham in the thread. 




 It's copy pasta. It was on Best of Outrage Culture. He's looking for gold. 




 [The SRS question has been asked. It's fucking long.](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/ct5qubn)

Apparently, even SRS can't escape reclassification. IT MUST BE BANNED!!!! 




 I'm seeing a lot of Conservatives and Republicans fearing for their lives. I think people here either don't know how to read English or don't understand that shitty subs are shitty subs. Either way. CT not getting the boot is fuckinf shitty. 




 Rapingwomen is done for. 




 Same shit happens in Anime.  




 It looks like a costume from Star Trek: TNG 




 I hope the first guy gets as many questions as Lloyd Kaufman.  




 I NEED A HERO! 




 Looks like that prison could have used an El Chaporone.  




 They're a Redditor. You're a Redditor. I'm a Redditor. No where did I say he's wrong in calling out the hypocrisy. I would like for you to point out where I said, "He is wrong you can exclude opinions based on the color of skin."

I just think that it's funny that when given an opportunity to hear from the conservative element of Reddit, they do the same thing based on gender and no one calls them out.   




 Proof that sometimes people send nasty PMs during a brigade? I have plenty, but none from Circlebroke. As far as I know, they've never brigaded me. I have plenty from SRD, SRS, and other circlejerk subs. Shit, I was even brigaded by /r/videos[1] once.

He said it, but then provided no proof? Am I going crazy? Has Reddit gone from "we're all science savants" to "I have proof which I cannot show at this time for it is privileged information." 




 I didn't say it was. I just think it's a weird double standard. 




 That score by Edward Shearmur is a 100 percent classic in my book. Perfect. It's a shame these guys didn't get a chance to work again. 




 A fake, made up thing Fox news once got upset about because a young adult author wrote about a bunch of teen girls giving guys blowjobs with different color lipsticks. Hence, rainbow. Roy G. Biv was a lucky guy. 




 19 sucked. I was poor, lonely and had a shit flip phone. Some of these dudes around here seem like they want to go back as they are now because they think they'll be the coolest shit on campus. 




 I sold blowjobs in high school, so I take pride in knowing it's me :)
That's a prostitute. A slut would do it for free.

I enjoy that it rhymed.  




 I hope this is satire, but I've been in True Reddit for a while. They have a large contingent of gamergater, "I don't read articles," "just talking common sense" Bill Burr types. So they know their audience. 

you do realize what you are saying right? You are dismissing someone's opinion based on (your own perceived idea) of what their skin color is. It's baffling to me that you seem to be literally unable of hearing someone's opinion, solely because of the color of their skin.

It's maybe baffling, but then again I read r/videos comments [where they do shit like this](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3dcedn/some_local_kids_in_my_town_recently_shot_and/ct44gcd). It's not like Redditors don't do it if they hear one of those infamous buzzwords.  




 Dear suckerberg,

Love,

 Who wants to bet a repost of the futurama math formula for time travel repost is not far behind? 




 And the VHS Rewinder. 




 It's a weird story, but probably because everyone would think it's promoting some form of entertainment imperialism and colonialism.  




 They let Floyd Mayweather handle the AMA today. He brought May showers of grammatical errors.  




 Reddit didn't decide to attempt to pretend like they run a company before. 




 After 10 years, Alexis and Huffman realize that people who pay money expect the guys running a company to work for a living. 




 Like Karmanaut need the ego boost to tell people on a first date, "You know guys. I brought down Reddit." 




 She looks like Zooey Deschanel. Like it's reeeeeally close match. 




 Most of this video is comprised of exactly the kind of hipster girls I expected to see.  




 He's not my Jonas. Maybe he's someone elses Jonas. 




 Either those comments are real or Marvel has a very dedicated group of PR professionals.  




  What? No it wasn't and no they didn't. The first Transformers movie is literally the only movie I've ever walked out of. 

Congratulations on this anecdotal evidence. Roger Ebert gave it [3 out of 4 stars](http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/transformers-2007). But please, rant on.

You know what? I'm just going to tell myself that you're being sarcastic so I can get some sleep tonight.

Do you always lose sleep over movies other people like?  




 This text might be the biggest "DAE REMEMBER THE GREATEST GENERATION" type shit I've ever seen on this sub.  




 Trans people, i'll allow.

HEY GUYS! THIS GUY WILL ALLOW IT. WE'RE ALL CLEAR FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THAT TRANS TEMPLE ON TOP OF NEW YORK CITY. 




 "I remember the good old days of Game Journalism. When Nintendo Power was owned by Nintendo and bugs didn't crawl on my bed-sheets to eat all this spare Doritos dust." 




 I think the first Transformers has a better chance than the other three. Transformers 1 was a legit good movie. Even the critics were shocked Michael Bay had pulled off Steve Spielberg's a boy and his dog story so well. 




 There are no content creators on Voat. The Voaters are starting to realize that the great content creators and karmawhores are the people that run reddit. It's why you can wake up every day and find up to date information. /v/movies has shit from 7 days ago sitting on page 2. There's nothing there but shit posters, the bigots and unfunny assholes that think "DAE Reddit" is a funny joak.

The worst part is the Free Speech clowns keep using this faulty slippery slope argument. Slippery slopes are supposed to end in something bad for it to be a viable argument. Coontown is not going to get any sympathy from any one if it disappears tomorrow. And Anime and their waifus won't be on the chopping block.
