 Same. I'm on XB1, you? 




 The gunsmith is selling a scout rifle with the perk "Shoot to Loot". When you shoot an ammo pack on the floor with the SR, it will pick the ammo up for you. 




 Experienced Sword runner, relic holder, strike-doer and crucible player. Message Jade Sueta or leave your GT below saying what you need help with! 




 I thought it was a football? 




 Really?! Are you okay? 




 We have CP, Wanna help us out? 




 Message Jade Sueta or inv me to your group. 31 hunter, max gally, tons of exp. 




 Yes. 




 He got a legendary heavy engram, so it won't be an IB weapon and it will probably turn out to be two ascendant energies when he decripts it at Rahool. 




 TrippieMang had the best k/d (13.0) and he only got 2 ascendant energies :( 




 Magic Mountain is a whole different amusement park, buddy..... 




 Can we stop with the "can we stop with the 'can we stop' "posts? I see at least 3 of these a week. Beating to dead horse won't change anything. 




 What level? 




 Only requirement is you must have maxed Sultan SA/5. Message Jade Sueta  




 I can be sword bearer on Crota, relic holder for VoG, can grind out some Iron Banana, etc. Message Jade Sueta. 




 I can sherpa you through it anytime, add Jade Sueta. Not everyone is like that, you just ran into some bad people. 




 Thank you for caring, it really means a lot. My step mom is getting gradually better, she buys me Apple cider, and snacks for school. I really think I can make it just a few more months. I AM talking to people about it. You, my mom, I even call my brother in San Francisco from time to time just to vent. Again, thank you. 




 They spoil them completely. Look at one of my old posts, my 4 y/o bro has an iPad! But when I'm around, I take care of them. When I'm not there, they yell at them *sometimes* but only when they deserve it. They love my little brothers, just not me. 




 Just a few months, and I can get out. I can wait. None of my teachers like me, or will listen to me. I talk too much and try to get attention, since at home I don't get much. My birthday is in May, I can make it.  




 I talk to my mom about it a lot and she says I will either have to speak up to them or live with it. She will help me through anything, I know that. I'm just afraid. My school doesn't have a counselor, I dont want to talk to one anyway. Thank you for the kind words. I don't think my dad will do anything physically, he hasn't in a while. The only thing he has done to me was spank, but I think he knows I'm too old for that now. He has threatened once in the past few months, I fear he will go through with it, but deep down I just know he won't. My stepmother threatened to slap me in the face, but I don't even fear her. I just despise her. 

I'm trying to take care, but it's just so hard being the only adult around because my father and stepmom won't. I'm practically raising my little brothers. 




 I will only regret the decision to *not* leave.  




 I have tried talking to them... My older brother has as well. When that happened, my dad slammed him into a cabinet. He later moved out to my mom's house. When I tried to talk to them, they just started yelling at me that I have a bad attitude and I got grounded for 3 weeks. 

My brothers wonderful advice was to put up with it and act like I was happy and always have a smile on my face. Then when I turn 13, move out to my mom's house. My brother waited until my dad pushed him (age 17) because he didn't want me to be alone there. But here I am, about to turn 13, and I'm so so scared of telling them I want to leave. My mom knows, she said my dad would take it to court, and we would have to fight. She said we would win, because dad already has lost a son. If CPS has been called before this on him then surely we will win, right? and it's not about the chores; I'm fine with doing chores. It's that the ONLY time they EVER talk to me is to yell at me about them. 

Our family will never come together. You would thing that my bro leaving is a wake up call to them, but it's not. They still think they are the perfect parents with the perfect family, and they will always think that. Some people dont change.

 




 Haha my dad is a cop. 




 It's not like that. They hate me too. I dont talk to them, I'm basically a maid. You think it's "oh its the standard teenager, saying she hates her (step)parents because they won't get her an iPhone 6". I'm just here ~~so I don't get fined~~ so they can be lazy. 




 My dad only ever talks to me if it's to do chores/schoolwork. I can't remember the last time he *actually* talked to me. He always yells, and complains that he's so sore from crossfit. 

My stepmother acts like she owns me, like I'm an *object*. I don't have real conversations with here either. When I'm at this house, I never talk. Just do chores, mow the lawn, get grounded because I have a bad attitude, and do schoolwork that isn't due for 3 WEEKS. They always yell at me, make me call them Sir and Ma'am.

And I hate them for it. 




 That they aren't perfect. 




 Message Jade Sueta to get the grind on!
