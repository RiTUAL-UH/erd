 Are your in laws really going to be with you for 15 hours a day every day for a week? That seems like a bit much! A lot of people in this sub seem to suggest that visitors never visit for more than an hour at a time since new moms are exhausted and trying to learn how to parent. You shouldn't have to entertain your in laws all day soon after giving birth. If they stay in a hotel, they will have somewhere else to go if you ever want quiet, rest, moments of privacy, or are just plain tired of guests.  




 Hi all! I've been lurking /r/tryingforababy and /r/BabyBumps for ages, but I've always been disappointed because I don't belong to either. Needless to say, I'm glad this sub exists!

I'm 23 and hubby is 24. We have been together for almost 4 years and in August we will celebrate our 2nd anniversary. Over the years, I've realized that I want nothing more than to be a mom, maybe even a stay at home mom. I obsess over all things parenting - I'm constantly "pinning" things on Pinterest, reading articles about parenting, and I love reading people's experiences over on BabyBumps and BeyondtheBump. However, we haven't found the right time to TTC yet. DH and I both graduated college last year and we are in student debt up to our eyeballs. We are currently living in a crappy, moldy apartment and desperately want out. We currently don't have nearly as much money as we'd like to have before starting a family.

Luckily, DH got an amazing job right out of college, and he's already received a promotion and a nice raise. We are working hard to stick to a budget so we can be in a good place financially. After years of being incredible stupid with money, we finally got our shit together and got ourselves completely out of credit card debt. So all we have in terms of debt is student loans. We're currently focusing on saving money for a house since we NEED to get out of this apartment. Hubby calculates that we can have enough money for a good payment as early as January 2016. Currently, that's the only thing holding us back from TTC. I want a house first or at least be a little closer to buying because (1) I do not want to deal with the stress of moving while pregnant or with a newborn and (2) I do not want to raise a baby in this tiny, moldy apartment. 

Anyway, I decided to introduce myself finally thanks to the "Is anyone else not working  amp;amp; trying to find purpose?" thread that was posted the other day. I've been feeling that way for a long, long time. I haven't been working since graduating college due to some minor yet annoying health problems - I suffer from frequent migraines and I'm still trying to get them under control. I know that my purpose in life is to raise a family, and not having kids absolutely kills me. I can't find anyone who understands because everyone tells me that kids are awful or that I'm still young and have plenty of time to have them, and that maybe I should work so I'm not "bored." Ugh. I'm glad I found people who finally understand how I feel.

So anyway... Hello! 




 Aww, yay! Happy anniversary. Here's to hoping your stay at TryingForABaby is a short one :)

 I'm just a lowly lurker here... But I thought I would pop in and say the books are amazing. I'm only on book 3 of the series though. I absolutely love reading books with such a strong female protagonist.  




 I absolutely love the scarves Claire wears on the show, but haven't gotten around to making one. Beautiful! I'm jealous.  




 Shame 




 I agree with /u/SageOfTheWise, but I also think more than anything he is just praising the work of Tobias Menzies. Tobias is amazing on Outlander, and GRRM probably wants him to bring his talent back to GoT. He joked that he's jealous Outlander has more air time then GoT, so maybe GRRM is also a little jealous Outlander currently has Tobias's talent?  




 It's a race to see which will be released first: this or Winds of Winter. My bet is on this... 




 Stannis is about to lose his father of the year award.

Edit: aaaannnd it's gone.  




 Wow I see a few from Xavier. Go Muskies! :) 




 You are correct. My husband is in the financial field and just explained this to me a couple days ago. You cannot contribute more than you earn.  




 :) Were you there the same week as us? May 9-May 16 




 I was a little skeptical about staying there at first since it's a value resort - I feared it would have a cheap motel feel to it and would be too crowded. We stayed at French Quarter last time and I thought Pop wouldn't be as nice. I must say, I like Pop so much more. Despite being in a room on the first floor, it was fairly quiet (we were on an end in the middle of nowhere though so that might be why haha). The grounds were beautiful and the 50s pool was relaxing - a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of Disney. Absolutely amazing value. 









 This happened to us a few weeks ago, on May 15th. We had a fast pass for Space Mountain, but it kept shutting down throughout the day so I kept changing my fast pass for later and later. It ended up shutting down at like 7:00pm and never reopened. I went to change the fast pass on the Disney app and found that I had been given a fast pass I could use on any ride at any time. It was awesome. 




 "Well I don't want you to give him any grief about this, ya know, cause you could traumatize him and turn him into a serial killer or something."
"Well don't worry. How much damage could he do with only one free hand?" 




 Yeah but George RR Martin survives solely on the tears of fans. Diana does not. She cares about her fans' feelings haha.
