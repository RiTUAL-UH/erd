 'You cant change your Situation, all you can change is how you choose to deal with it''

 In honest opinion, dump him. Do you honestly want to be with someone who you can't trust? 




 Okay so clearly she is not your friend if shes talking to your ex.
In all honestly, dump her and your ex.   




 I don't think it's good for your daughter.  




 LUCY, I was so disappointed  




 Sliver Linings Playbook 




 50/50- It was personal for me because my dad has cancer. Anna Kendrick character said a quote that helps me through the hard times and makes me more positive "you can't change the situation but you can change how you deal with it''  




 My mom loved Lee's Daniel's The Butler. She couldn't understand why I didn't like the movie. Oprah's death ruined the movie for me. I thought it could of been shown better.

 Agreed! 




 Thank you so much and thank you. Good luck and you are in the right field because your field will always be needed! It sucks that people do not have patience when I ask them to repeat something but hey I do hope one day people become more aware because its sad when people think deaf and hearing impaired are the same thing!  




 LOL it was an old man. I doubt he found me attractive, if he did I would be sketched out. Thank you!! I like to add some humour as well. My favourite part of pitch perfect when there was a scene where this club Deaf Jews appeared. Since then, I joke i'm in the back. I learned sense of humour gets you through it.  




 I think it's great to be in that field. I'm sending you a e-hug as well!  Techonlogy is amazing. I can listen to music wirelessly its amazing. I can never do that 10 years ago.  




 I've been hearing impaired for all my life and I wear two hearing aids. Yes, I'm very lucky to be able to get the care I need, but there are several struggles that I face everyday that many do not. Having a sense of humour helps me through this. I joke when my friends didn't hear me (shocking right) I say that my hearing loss is spreading onto them lol. I also joke that I'm the extra in pitch perfect in the deaf jew scene. I no longer have to worry about what to dress up as for halloween. I just need to be myself!

1- I had a professor refuse to repeat what he said in the lecture (no power points) even though the week before I told him I was hearing impaired. He said if I didnt keep on raising my hand I would of heard it. 

2- People tell me that I talk to loud and a recent incident happened when I was sitting outside with friends at Starbucks and someone told me to lower my voice. I can't hear how loud I am and people do not understand that it's not my fault.

3- People think I'm deaf and it's sad that people do not know the difference between hearing impaired and deaf.

4- In loud places, I have a hard time hearing conversations 

5- People ask the same questions- can you sleep with them, can you shower/swim with them, if you take them off can you hear, can you read lips/can you read mine, can you get electrocuted? (yes someone asked that) 

6- A few years ago, I worked at a day camp. A kid wanted my attention and I talked to her then I went back to listening to the others when I heard people laughing. My co-workers were laughing at me because the kid wanted my attention again and I didn't hear. I hated working there.

I made this post because I believe people need to be more aware of hearing impairement and deaf. So the next time you hear someone talk loud think before you speak. They may wear hearing aids.  




 But they are still in a relationship regardless. I just hope this was worth it because you could loose a freindship  




 He will care  




 What I'm trying to say is that I didn't have a choice.- everyone has a choice or should. It's our right too. I just hope the choice you made is worth it because your friendship with your best friend won't be the same ever. Don't guys say bros before hoes? 




 I would end it because she does not the feel the same way about you if she was unfaithful to you.  




 I'm sorry to hear that. That happened with my friend too.  




 You only dated him for 2 months and he is already has a list of things for you to change. If I were you, I would run before the lists gets longer. If he really liked you for you who are, you wouldn't have to change.  




 Watch Movies! 




 Gay and Vegan are two completely different things. Vegan is a choice of a lifestyle the person has made and it has to do with food. Where gay is a sexuality and has to do with being attracted to same sex. Being gay is more accepted now than in the past but its still not a 100%. Where as Vegan is being healthy since now its the new thing to be skinny and be healthy. Some people on the internet are stupid. I would be all over that shit.  




 I have depression, and I went through a very difficult time from Nov-March. My dad cancer spread and after hearing so many good things it crushed me knowing that the treatment didn't work. When my sister told me she was engaged a week after I didn't feel anything. That's when I started to notice things were not so good. Suicidal thoughts began and I would always think about my funeral. Once I finally opened up to my therapist and my friends/family about it. I feel a lot better knowing that I'm not fighting it by myself. Yes it was hard to open up, but now I don't feel ashamed and I do not feel alone. I love movies, I watch movies all the time and it allows me to look forward to things ahead. I still have depression but I feel a lot better than I did before. I accepted what I had and I'm not letting it stop me. I always have a laugh about life because it makes things better when things are funny!  




 Easy A. 




 I'm glad I wasn't the only one who felt that way when watching Magic Mike. There was no chemistry at all between Channing and Cody. I felt like I was watching a really bad date.  




 I don't think it will be a sci-fi classic in 20 years because it was released at a bad week with Fault of Our Stars and it killed EOT at the box office.  




 It's too early to look at rotten tomatoes because yesterday was the first showing with the finished cut of the movie.  




 So I was really lucky and I got to attend the first advance screening in Toronto for Zach Braff second movie Wish I Was Here that he directed, produced, written and acted in. I also got to meet him in this fancy room with fancy drinks and food for all FREE! This girl on twitter couldn't go so she gave them to me! The movie was good, 3/5 stars! The soundtrack was good as well! 

Fun fact: Steve Spielberg is in the credits for helping making the movie happening.  




 Glad to hear!! :) keep skating!  




 Happy Christmas
Magic in the moonlight

 You don't really need to watch the others. It's just better so you will know what happened because it continues from First Class. I liked first class

 Lol 




 Thank you very much for the suggestions! It's nice to hear from others on how they dealt with this sort of situation. 




 Meryl Streep for sure.  




 The love interest of Channing Tatum in Magic Mike
Teresa Palmer in Warm Bodies  




 I liked Drinking Buddies and I'm also a fan of Anna Kendrick. This movie looks hilarious and its nice to see Anna in a new role that we haven't seen her in yet.
