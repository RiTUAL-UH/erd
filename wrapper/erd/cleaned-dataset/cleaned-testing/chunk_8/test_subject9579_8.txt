 I had them anyway so I just went for it.  




 I didn't really farm, just opened what I got for the first few days. Some favors (sold them, didn't want the horse), potions, profession stuff, and enchantments (made 2 rank 6). 

Then Sunday rolls around and I'm still without a Lucky Coin so I found one for a decent price on the AH and got it. 

And what do you know, like an hour later I had one drop, so my friend got a Lucky Coin too.  




 I guess I'm an optimist somewhere deep down because I think pretty much any two people can make it work if they're both willing to put in the effort. 

That's why it's important that your BF understands why this is important to you and how big of a deal it is. He has to put forth the effort, even if the progress is slow, for you to feel validated. 

Good luck.  




 Treat them like your landlords (they are). Sit down and discuss what responsibilities they expect from you and your husband. Are you paying rent? If not, are you contributing in another fashion? Groceries? Utilities? Cooking meals periodically? 

What are appropriate quiet times, bathroom schedules, access to common areas? Are there any areas off limits to each other (ie stay out of each other's rooms)? What kind of cleaning do they expect from you (just personal areas or common areas as well or whole house, is there a rotation expected)?

Your husband probably isn't anxious because they are his parents and he's sure of his relationship with them. Just approach them tactfully and say you are really appreciative of them opening their home to you and you want to make the situation as smooth as possible. More communication means less misunderstandings. 

Edit: You don't mention if you have children. If you do you need to make it clear what rules your in laws expect to be followed and also make it clear what type of discipline is acceptable. When I lived with my in laws I had a rule that my wife and I would discipline our children and my in laws needed to let one of us know if there was a problem. If the children are left alone with the in laws, only then would they receive discipline from them.  




 I suppose, looking back, I could have been clearer. 

She crossed a line with Sam and she is dating Toby. 

I'm not asking if these things happened or if she's had sex with them. 

My issue is that she feels like she had no obligation towards me once she said 'I want a divorce' and therefore feels justified in all that she has done. 

She had already checked out I suppose but I hadn't. I feel like the very least she could have done was told me she had met someone but she lied to me and I feel like, even though our marriage is ending that that is not ok.

Do I have unreasonable expectations of adult behavior or is her declaration of a desire for divorce enough to sever any responsibility we have to each other in the relationship?

Edit: a word 




 I don't think I'm in denial but I'm willing to admit that my judgement may not be the clearest at the moment. There are A LOT of emotions I'm dealing with. 

Again, I have a lawyer, we are proceeding with a divorce. I have take steps (with advice from my lawyer) to separate our finances and property as much is as appropriate right now. 

I am doing my best to be strong and be there for my kids. 

I'm just having a really hard time dealing with how betrayed I feel and it doesn't help that she is totally unapologetic. To ask her she has every right to do what she has done. 




 We are getting divorced. 

Maybe I wasn't clear in my post, but my desire for counseling was before I was in the hospital. 

After she basically abandoned me and told me she 'couldn't support me' I was done with any thought of reconciliation. 

I'm not trying nor do I have any desire to save the marriage. We are negotiating through our respective lawyers over details but are nearing a settlement. 

My questions have to do with whether her actions would be considered cheating by anyone else. I feel like she did, she insists she didn't and her actions are justified. Am I crazy for feeling betrayed and cheated on? 




 This may be a little long, so, sorry. 

At the beginning of January I stumbled across a text conversation between my wife and a coworker. I wasn't trying to snoop, she works late nights are restaurant a few nights a week and she had been out late one night after a shift and fell asleep on the couch once she was home. I tried to wake her so she could move to the bed but she wasn't budging. So I thought I would at least plug her phone in for her. When I did I noticed a text alert from the guy. I had heard her mention his name, we'll call him Sam, before but was curious why he was texting my wife at 3:00 in the morning. 

At this point we still had access to each other's phones/emails etc. We had always shared passwords as I though we had nothing to hide. So I opened the conversation. 

It wasn't explicit but it made me uncomfortable. I should mention that I had been feeling more and more distance from her for the few months prior to this and was starting to feel pretty depressed because of it. 

The were texting back and forth about something I can't remember but I do remember it was a longer text conversation than I had had with my wife for some time. Our recent ones were all business and always short. They were flirty and at one point she said that if she had known him 10 years ago they would have had a lot of fun together. 

We've been married 9 years, our anniversary was in December. 

I went to work and I wrote her a long email about how I had been feeling distant from her and I didn't like it and how that conversation made me feel really uncomfortable and jealous. I felt like I could get my emotions across better in writing. 

When I got home later that day, before I could speak to her, before she had even read the email, she told me we needed to talk and that she wanted a divorce. 

This was pretty shocking to me because even though I wasn't happy with the recent distance and I knew we had issues, divorce had never crossed my mind. 

I wanted to work things out. She said she didn't want to waste any more time in a relationship that was never going to work out. 

We argued and talked for a few weeks and eventually she suggested that we separate and allow each other some space (and therapy) and after some time had passed we could start going to couples therapy. 

She said there was nothing going on with Sam and she wasn't asking for a divorce/separation because she was interested in seeing other people either specifically (ie Sam) or in general. 

Well, during this time I found another conversation between her and Sam, this time they were explicit.  She was saying how as soon as things were 'settled' how she wanted to 'have solo much fun' with him and how he better live up to the hype.  She was also sharing her sexual preferences and she said at one point 'Why didn't I go home with you? I wish I knew where you lived.'

I felt floored after that and my depressed state that had been building even before the first texts reached a point where I wanted to kill myself. 

I ended up checking myself into a hospital and staying for most of the month of Feb. 

Before I did that, I had also noticed her texting a lot with another coworker, we'll call him Toby. She said Toby was just a friend and I never saw anything inappropriate between them, just a lot of texts in general. 

While I was hospitalized she basically abandoned me. She made no effort to bring our children to visit (they couldn't come directly to the ward but there was an area I could have supervised visits with them outside the ward). She only called me once, she did answer the phone most of the time if I called but shortly after my arrival told me 'I can't support you'.  She also never asked how I was doing when we did talk and was only concerned with when I would be home. She never visited me on her own either and only came to the hospital once to attend a meeting with my treatment team where she declared that she didn't want me to come home when I left and if I tried that she would make it a 'legal issue'

When I did return home she refused to sleep in the same room as me (we had been still sharing a bed previously) and had changed all her passcodes/passwords so I no longer had access to anything. She was also spending as much time away from the home as she could. Before I was hospitalized it was common for her to go out for a drink after a restaurant shift and be home late (1 or 2 am). That time had been getting later and later though as things went on and shortly before I checked myself in she didn't come home at all one night. 

Once I was back she wouldn't come home until 3:00 or 4:00 on shift nights and other nights would stay out until sometime after 11 usually (her day job is done at 5:30). 

I was suspicious and jealous and now I was snooping. This time I found a notebook she had written to Toby saying how she had been trying to think of a gift to give him for awhile since his birthday was the next day.  So she came up with this notebook where she was going to write down lyrics to all the songs that made her think of him and want to be close to him. She said hoped he had a great year coming up and how she was so excited to be starting out the year with him. She finished the intro, 'I love you Toby'

When I confronted her about the book she told me that as far as she was concerned we were separated as of the day I checked into the hospital and she didn't owe me any kind of explanation or consideration. 

We are moving forward on the divorce. I am in therapy. 

My lingering questions are this: 

1. I feel like she crossed a line with Sam but I don't know that it's technically an emotional affair (I believe nothing physical happened between them). Did she cheat with him?

2.  Is she right that she didn't/isn't cheating with Toby since she has already told me she wanted a divorce and we were 'separated'?  My feeling is since we never discussed seeing other people and in fact, she had stated that she wasn't interested in doing so that she went behind my back with this relationship. Am I being too literal with my definitions?

3. How do I move passed this?

I feel like I need answers to 1  2 so I know if I can tell people that she cheated on me and not be thought of a paranoid or crazy. Not that I'm planning on screaming it from the rooftops or anything but, like, if it comes up. 

But regardless of what I tell people how do I get passed the feeling that I've been cheated on?  I don't think I'm at the point where I'm going to assume all women are lying, cheating harlots but I'm afraid some insecurities are going to pop up in the future about this issue. 

Thanks to anyone who actually read all of that. 

TLDR: My wife and I are getting divorced. She's started a relationship with another man behind my back. Is she cheating or is she justified?

 




 Sounds good.  




 I'm up. 

I've run it once before but had major issues with the boss. Having a good team would be a big help.

 'Hey baby. We need to talk. I love you and I think you're really hot (insert appropriate specifics about his features that you enjoy). I love the sex we have but I think it could be better. I really get turned on when I know that you're having a good time and that you're really into what we're doing. I need to be able to get real feedback about what you like so I can make things better for you and better for me. I hope you know that I would never judge you for what you say.'

Something like that for an opener, maybe. As for the non-answers you're going to have to be a little blunt. If you ask 'Do you like it when I do...' And he says 'I don't know' you're going to have to straight out tell him that that isn't helpful. Tell him you need an answer. Try to phrase your questions so he can answer Yes or No, giving longer, more detailed answers (though helpful) may be too much for him right now. I think it's going to be a slow process. 

You also need to start telling him what you like and what you expect. If you want more oral, let him know. 

'I really like going down on you because of how excited it makes you, it makes me feel good to please you. Don't you want do the same for me?'

If you want him to initiate, let him know. Come up with a sign or phrase he can use to get things going. 

'I think it's really hot when you start things. The next time you want me I want you to (touch me here, kiss me there, say 'this')'

Share with him your fantasies. Start with things that you guys have already done 'I really loved it that one time when we...' He may not be ready to hear everything yet. 

On the masturbation front it's going to take time for him to feel ok with talking with you about it. I have some of the same issues with it.  I've always felt on some level that it's something I need to be ashamed of. Additionally I've never had a partner who was totally ok with it, which I'm sure hasn't helped. 

You might be able to get things going by introducing porn yourself. Have you got yourself off in from of him?  Tell him you want to watch a movie (not X rated) that has a scene that really turns you on (don't tell him that part ahead of time). When you get to that part tell him that you're feeling really turned on from watching that and ask if it's ok if you touch yourself. Letting him feel like he's in control may help him feel more comfortable with the idea. If he's game then do it and encourage him to do the same. If he doesn't want to get himself off then tell him to touch you and kiss you but don't transfer to PIV. Let him know that you love PIV (if he asks) but that sometimes it's fun to just touch yourself and be touched. 

If that goes well you can bring up watching something more explicit together and see how that goes. 

You're going to have to be his guide, open the doors. Hopefully he will reach a point where he can be a more equal participant in your sexual journey but for now you're going to have to lead and he's going to have to follow. 

Last, but not least (hope you're still with me after this massive response) if things aren't progressing to your liking you may want to seek out counseling. And you also need to consider, if things don't improve, that you too just aren't sexually compatible. That can be a relationship killer. You feeling constantly frustrated by him (and sexually) will lead to resentment and loss of respect. 

I don't think it's hopeless but I can't say it will be easy and it definitely won't be quick. 

Good luck.  




 Read over your custody agreement and see if there is a provision requiring in parent to inform the other of changes in living arrangements. My custody agreement has such a clause. 

If yours does not then there is probably nothing you can do to force him to tell you. If it does then he is in violation of your agreement and you need to contact a lawyer to see what your next steps are.  




 I can't tell you to stay or leave, that's a choice only you can make but here are a couple things to think of that I got from your story:

You wife is sorry that she broke your trust, but not sorry enough to actually cut contact with the other guy. 

She didn't come to you and admit anything, you found her out. And even given the chance to come clean, she lied. She would have continued to lie if never confronted with proof. 

Leaving aside your history with her is this the type of person you want to be with?  Someone who is totally comfortable lying to you and at least from an outside perspective, not sorry for doing it?

If you stay a lot of things need to change, most of them have been mentioned already. You need to figure out what is best for you. 

I promise you that you being happy and sane is way more important to your children than just staying married to stay married. 

Good luck.  




 Make it clear to him how big a deal this is to you, that it's making you question your future together. 

Tell him if something doesn't change that you cannot continue. 

Be prepared, if you guys stay together, to assume responsibility for things that CANNOT be forgotten (money, birth certificates, medical appointments, etc)

You can work with him on setting schedules and routines, that should help with his forgetfulness a little bit. Chances are though, he's never going to be a super responsible person when it comes to physical items. Some people just can't do it. 

It doesn't mean he's a bad person and it doesn't mean that he would (automatically) be a bad father. 

I would speak with him, enforce the importance of the issue, and set a small goal. 

If he makes acceptable progress towards meeting that goal (acceptable to you) then continue. If he doesn't try or doesn't take it seriously then I would consider breaking things off with him. 

He cannot change this part of his personality overnight but if he is serious about yours and his relationship then he needs to make an effort.  




 It could just be low libido. Or it could be something else, or a combination of the two. 

First, I think he needs to see a doctor. You don't mention his energy level but if his testosterone is low then low energy (and libido) would likely be symptoms. To make it easier for him (if it's true) maybe focus on he energy side rather than the sexual side. 'I think you should get this checked out, having correctly balanced hormones can give you more energy and generally make you feel better'. Something like that. Also, speak with him about your dad going. I love that your parents are so supportive but the idea of going with your dad may seem very intimidating. If he doesn't want to go alone maybe you could offer to accompany him. 

I feel like, given his upbringing and current environment, that he is very uncomfortable talking about sex.  You need to work on that with him. 

Let him know that you love him and you enjoy the sex that you have but you would like to be more open with each other. It will probably take awhile to draw him out but make it clear all along the way that you love him and you want/need for him to be open with you about his desires/kinks/fetishes, etc.

I think he is probably lying to you about masturbation. But, try not to take that personally, I feel like that's a product of his upbringing; the fact that he feels like it's wrong and something to be ashamed of. I wouldn't take it as a slight against you or a sign that he doesn't trust you. 

And maybe he doesn't have any defined preferences or kinks but that doesn't mean you guys can't figure out together what he likes.

Tell him that you want to try new things and find out what he likes. He likes when you wear skirts, maybe he would like a whole school girl get up or some stockings. Try new positions. Go slowly with new things and have conversations afterwards about what he likes/didn't like. And it's ok if he didn't like everything but don't accept non-answers. He needs to communicate. 

Tell him over and over that this is important to you and is an issue that needs to be taken seriously, not just brushed off. 

Hopefully you can get him to be communicative and he can learn more about his sexual self. 

Good luck.
