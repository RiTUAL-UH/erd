 Check out The Year of Darkness. It's my favorite. 




 You know in the first movie when Hagrid says, "Welcome Harry, to Diagon Alley."?

It's exactly like that. 




 Thanks for your response. 




 While reading, I imagined Fenrir to be more like Sabertooth in the Marvel comics. 




 Basically because of his College career.

Sitting behind Andy showing him the ropes for a year, I think He's the shizz. 




 He's (Ricky) genius if you ask me.
 




 HAHA! N and V are the letters most used in the entire book. 




 Rude how, to whom? 




 Cheers. I have.. um homework to do. 




 [Have fun](https://youtu.be/Jc20vMz0V7Q)

 




 So you do like Richard Harris?
 




 [HA!](https://youtu.be/Kr9_5uZn6ds) 




 How? He is stating his beliefs.

 I think it was something about two films ending with battles at Hogwarts. What really pissed me off was not including Bill until, "Got in a fight with a werewolf." 

Seriously, wtf was that? Harry *knows*, Harry was *there* at Bill's bedside in the hospital wing FFS! 




 What I am expecting to see from #5 in the preseason is nothing less than spectacular. My question is, what or who could we get for Dalton? Trades in the NFL are rare, but not unheard of.  




 Because HP was a multi-million dollar franchise.

Cartman would have a fitting line here, "I do what I want!"

Chiris Colubus was the truest to the books I think, Cuaron had a pretty cinescape, and was close to to the script. I have nary a clue where Newell's head was. I thought Yates was good with finishing the series, but he was the only one who actually *added* scenes, and that shit drives me crazy.
 




 I'm not denying a good theory here, it didn't happen like the in the *Prince's Tale* though. Honestly, if I hadn't read the books first, I would have been rather confused. Like I said, they're just fun to look at. 




 Man, you're going to just have to accept the films more as addendum than canon. They are like nature, they're pretty to look at, but I wouldn't take any HP film adaptation as canon. EXCEPT! The Fantastic Beasts trilogy is being written solely by Ms. Rowling, so that can be canon. We just have to wait. 




 I thought she was a giant cunt. 




 I'm going to go with the flow and say Minerva *or* Filius. 









 In Latin class. 

Siriusly though, check the common/repeat questions in the sidebar. 




 That's a good point. 




 I have PS in Icelandic. I'll be damned if I can read a word of it, but it's cool to have.

Edit: [Here](http://i.imgur.com/ccowuKZ.jpg) it is.
 




 Because Albus knew the position was cursed and he wanted to live a little while longer. 




 I'm fairly sure that being a DE was a lifelong commitment, but what about if they simply got too old and feeble to carry out the tasks given to them by Voldemort? Would Riddle send them on their way to retirement with a nice severance package? What are your thoughts? 




 You could always pick your favorite [chapter art.](http://i.imgur.com/IJQ13E5.jpg) 




 So's your face. 




 I will stand by *The Parting of the Ways.* 

The brilliance shown by Dumbledore, the reuniting of two old school enemies, and Harry getting the best hug of his life. 

I cannot wait to get to that chapter in GoF. 




 Muriel, that's it. 




 All good.
 




 That was a Princess Bride reference... 




 Riddle used Harry's blood for two reasons:

1. He needed the blood of an enemy to regain his full body, and sure he could have used just about any witch or wizard in Britain because he was basically PE #1 at the time, but he chose Harry.

2. Which brings us to the second part, he used Harry's blood because he knew from Quirrellmort that he couldn't touch Harry without dying, so he took his blood in order to be able to. 




 Only mostly dead. 




 Also, She didn't want to introduce something new at the end of the book. 




 Absolutely, I hadn't thought of that. 




 Being part kneazle and therefore living longer, I think this is a very plausible theory.
 




 In DH when the Weasley Aunt, name escapes me now, says "Ginevra's dress is far too low cut." or something along those lines. 




 I was reading DH the night/morning of the release, and when Percy toppled out of the portrait into the RoR, I sat the book on my lap and clapped, "YAY!" My wife was getting ready for work, and looked at me  like I had a third eye in the middle of my forehead. 




 NFL shut most of those sites down. 




 I have a black Dalton, white Green, orange Maualuga, and a black Gresham. 









 Friends. 




 ..but sometimes when I smoke, I cry like a little girl. I get emotional too easy when I'm high.

Edit: When I'm watching a cool man movie like Field of Dreams, or watching the US women win today. 




 They don't look you in the eye when they talk. I have two teenage daughters, and I *always* know when they are lying. 




  or they could create a new scene

Wouldn't be the first time... 









 If they didn't include Grawp, how would they have explained Harry and Hermione escaping Umbridge? 




 It's in the hospital wing after the tri wizard tourney. When Molly was at Harry's bedside and Albus knew that Voldemort had returned. He sent Snape to Voldemort, sent Lupin to the werewolves, Hagrid to the giants, Sirius was revealed as innocent, he regrouped the order and he did all of this within hours of Riddle's return.

Not to mention, Harry got the first hug that actually felt like it was from a mother.
 




 It's my belief that the DEs only came to Hogwarts because Draco had been given a task to do, and it had taken too long. Either he needed the backup to give him the balls to do it, or expected one of the foul fuckers he let in to do it. 




 For me, it would be when I get a new bag. I always start with the smallest buds, and I save the biggest for last. I also smoke the buds from bottom to top when I grind them.

Now I'm off to the village festivities. Happy Fourth! [7.5] 




 Right.. antlers. 




 Or people who adorn themselves with leaves and shit. I've been smoking almost 23 years, and I keep it to myself. You might describe my appearance as "stoner-like", long hair, goatee, comfortable clothes, but no one that doesn't know me would think I'm a smoker, because I am well spoken and if I do say so my myself, fairly intelligent. 




 No shit, I could buy 13 grams of some quality cannabis for that, and it would last me more than a month.
 




 Or the kids with those damn glass packs on the muffler. An ex of mine had one on her car, and I refused to drive it or ride in it. 




 That date is completely off, but otherwise pretty cool. 




 No Bagman either. He was a bigger story arc than Winky. 




 It wasn't said, but most people think he stayed at the burrow after the trio left the wedding so suddenly.
 




 *The Parting of the Ways*

It's the first time we get to see the absolute power of Dumbledore, and how he can so quickly set his plans in motion. 














 I have been swarmed by yellow jackets three times in my life. The first, I was around six years old, second was around 12, and the third was in my mid 20s. Each time I took about thirty stings. 




 Each chapter with new writing has a red quill in the upper right corner, so you can just look for those. 




 At the time he was Buckbeak. 




 Yea, but not this one.
 




 Retro is cool.
 




 You lot seem to forget that at least two of *The Advanced Guard* were ministry employees at the time, maybe Kingsley and Tonks set up some sort of jinx so the ministry wouldn't know. 









 Polygamy is still a weird subject

Not in Utah 









 Nice post, but I will say this. I have close friends my age with kids my kids age. I do *not* treat or talk to them the same way I do my own children. Their kids are more like little friends that I can tell dirty jokes to, and teach them nasty habits. Probably why no one has made me godfather yet. 




 She had five brothers left to use the family names, and she named Pigwidgeon.
 




 Luna was also one of Ginevra's best friends. 




 They spent plenty of time together at 12GP in OotP, unless Sirius was sulking in his room with Buckbeak. 




 Witherwings, if you please. 




 Plot. 









 That was a waste of a half hour of my life.
 














 HBP is also my favorite book. I'm not really a fan of the films, but you could say the same.

Harry has that swagger going on, he is like his father, just.. cool. He's worried about Draco of course, and he uses a curse that [SPOILER] Snape taught him to battle Draco, the showdown we finally got to see.

When it came to The Cave, Harry did exactly as he was instructed to. He kept feeding Albus the potion in order to get the [SPOILER] locket from the basin. And then he even chases down Snape and Malfoy because [SPOILER] Snape killed Dumbledore.

IMO, HBP was the best 'whodunnit'. 




 I like this better than the other. It's all about timing mate.
 




 My wife dropped ten pounds in two weeks on that diet. 




 Yes, white bread, pizza, donuts, biscuits, pasta, cookies... go whole grain.

And sugar. 




 Only water, and cut out white flour. 









 Meh... 




 I would take a lass, and use for an hour of sweet, sweet love. 




 Sure he could. 




 LOL!!! 




 I love this one too.
 




 Bertha was pregnant when Wormtail killed her, and they took her baby to give Riddle his body back.

Some have even suggested that he impregnated her. 




 Mine is that Voldemort got his rudimentary body back in GOF by using Bertha Jorkin's fetus. 




 Harry wasn't a true horcrux, this is BS.

EDIT: Horcruxes require a spell beforehand, and they are heavily protected by dark magic, none of this happened when the part of Tom Riddle's soul attached itself to the only other living thing in the house. The damn cat must have been out hunting.

EDIT2: You can downvote all you like, but She has stated this herself. Harry was not a *true* horcrux. 




 Harry looks scared. He's probably wondering when his hooman is going to come back and get him. 




 Predator could be an intergalactic bounty hunter too

No the predator species were just intergalactic hunters for the sport. 




 I am going to disagree with the general consensus. Boba is an intergalactic bounty hunter, and I think he has the edge. He's seen all sorts of beings, and I'm almost sure Jango taught him a few tricks of the trade. The first BAMF to escape the sarlaac definitely gets the win. 









 Haha, I mean the family vault not just Albus, I should have specified.
 




 What do you think would be in the Dumbledore vault at Gringotts? 




 Thriller 




 Red River Gorge 




 My dad told me as soon as they put that in my IV I lifted three nurses off the floor with each arm, then I flatlined. 




 Stripes or any John Candy film for that matter.
 




 Something about an invisible man in the sky. 




 No. I don't even remember the time I was out.

I was dead for about 45 seconds due to an allergic reaction to the MRI dye.

 




 Jim Gaffigan. Just something about his delivery.
 




  I will be locking the Roster the evening of June 1st!

Should be July, but I'm excited! 




 I saw these guys at the Tibetan Freedom Show in 97. They were an absolute highlight. I was crowd surfing most od the time, and Tim stuck his gum in my hair. 




 Another extremely plausible theory, but I doubt the Malfoys would have kept Frank around. 




 It is entirely possible that Albus bought it to give Frank Bryce something to do. That seems very Dumbledore like. 




 The Year of Darkness. 




 Pittsburgh, because I'm from Cincinnati. 




 I have that one, but I've lost the cape. 




 I think I got it, thanks.

 




 I guess that makes some sort of sense.
 




 OH! So you ask one, what the other would  say?
