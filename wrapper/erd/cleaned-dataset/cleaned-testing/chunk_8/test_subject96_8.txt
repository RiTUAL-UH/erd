 Damn glad to meet ya'! 




 This is a clear violation of the FLSA. Even if you weren't missing work for military service, as long as you work or attempt to work 40 hours a week, your employer must pay you your full salary for that week.

It's important for your employer to understand the potential downsides of what they're doing. Exempt refers to an exemption from regular hourly pay and overtime rules. If they violate the specific rules for exempt employees, they lose that exemption. 

That means that they must pay you overtime for all the hours you work over 40 in a week. And this can be applied retroactively. Which means you can sue them for back pay for every hour you've worked over 40 in a week going back to the time you were hired.
 









 Here's a question for you and for any resume adviser or job counselor debating how to put a McDonald's job on a resume. Do you think that the people most likely to read that resume, hiring manager or HR person or whoever, has never heard of McDonald's or is unaware of the kind of work people do there? Do you think that if you manage to present your burger-flipping and toilet-mopping duties in a sufficiently good light that you will convince any professional hiring person that your job there was any more than it was?

As others have noted, a fast food job can be a positive thing. It shows you can show up on time, learn new tasks, follow instructions and get along with your team. If you try to jump it up with crap like "strategically upselling menu items", the best you can hope for is that you'll make the resume reader laugh. It's more likely that your resume gets thrown in the "no" pile for rank stupidity.

 




 Yes, that seems like an odd spot for it.  









 I guess I-Con is never coming back, is it?

**sigh**

 




 There is no bathroom! 




 You can still search for stuff. I usually listed to Fresh Air when I'm mowing the lawn.

Still, they could make it easier to pick the stuff you want to listen to. 









 Have you tried the NPR One app? 




 Just remember, snitches get smooches.  




 Deadlines to apply for our summer programs have all passed, but definitely look into our [High School Research Program](http://www.bnl.gov/education/program.asp?q=111) for next year.

Our [Summer Sunday](http://www.bnl.gov/stakeholder/summerSundays.php) program is starting soon. It's for the general public, so you could come out and look around and see some of the work we do here. 




 I agree. The new one came out last week and I devoured the whole thing in a day.

Now I have to wait another year for the next one. 




 Nicholas Colasanto who played Coach on Cheers passed away after the end of the show's third season.  The fourth season premiere episode,  dealt with Coach's death as well as introducing Colasanto's successor, Woody Harrelson, as Woody Boyd.

 Your company will tell you how you should treat them. 

If your company treats people with professionalism and respect when they leave, letting them work out their two weeks or simply paying them for that time and sending them their way, then you give your proper notice as expected.

If they abuse people who are leaving, berating them and not letting them serve out their notice, then you don't give notice. Alternately, you can give two weeks notice on Friday, but plan to start  your new job the following Monday, expecting them to fire you. That way your can honestly claim you gave your expected two weeks.
 




 So the GOP is basically saying, "We don't care if young people vote for us ever again?".
 














 Hey, you fucked up. It happens. You didn't understand your limitations so you overpromised and underdelivered. That's not a bad fuckup for someone just starting out. 

Just make sure that:

1) You understand what you did wrong

2) You know why it was wrong

3) You know why you did it

4) You know how to avoid it in the future.

Otherwise it sounds like you did some good work there and you don't want to throw that out the window. It might not be a bad idea to call up the place you interned at and see what they're going to say about you when you give them as a reference.

Good luck. 




 Makes sense. He can already see her house. 




 The details vary from state to state, but generally, to collect unemployment you must have worked a certain minimum amount during the "base period" before you file.  

In almost every state, the base period is a one-year period: the earliest four of the last five complete quarters of the calendar year. For example, if you apply for unemployment in March 2015, the base period would be October 1, 2013 though September 30, 2014.

So these two months could be added to your base period credit if you file for unemployment in the future. 




 If they're not withholding taxes, then you're responsible for paying the employer share of FICA/Medicare unless they plan to slip you money under the table for it.

And while you may not be eligible for unemployment now, after only working there for two months, that work should be added to the service time with your next job so you'll be eligible for unemployment sooner. 




 That's...odd. 

Are you sure you were 1099? Did they withhold any taxes from your paychecks?  




 The main downsides of 1099 vs W-2 are:

1) Self employment tax. As a 1099, you must pay 15.3% of your income for FICA/Medicare. As a W-2, you pay half of that and your employer pays the other half.

2) Unemployment insurance: As a 1099 worker, you are not eligible for unemployment insurance. As a W2, you are.

3) Employee protections: As a W2 worker, you have much greater protection for things that might happen on the job. A lot of these protections (sexual harassment, FLSA, etc.) do not apply to 1099 workers.

If you're reclassified, you'll get some of these benefits back and your employer will have to pay. Plus they'll probably have to pay a fine and cover other costs, like workman's comp, that don't apply to 1099 workers.

Good luck! 




 Maybe still could be. Just because the hack came from this dude's IP doesn't mean he's actually the hacker. 









 Sounds kosher. 



















 I have a good feeling about it. Marvel has shown they can do something a little different with each picture.

I wouldn't be shocked if I ended up liking it more than Age Of Ultron, although that's not such a high bar to clear. 




 "Fuck you, Uwe" - All of us. 














 A bazillion to one.

 It's all in the reflexes.

 There's a little more information [at this link](http://easthamptonstar.com/Government/2015605/Uber-Pulls-Plug-Ride-Service-East-Hampton-Town)

A taxi law adopted several years ago and revised in 2014 requires cab companies to have a town business license, licenses for each of their vehicles, which triggers inspections by town ordinance enforcement officers, and licenses for individual drivers. 

I think if there was an easy workaround, Uber would have found it. Seems as if each individual Uber driver has to have a business license, a town license and an office. I suppose a bunch of Uber drivers could club together and get an office, but they'd still need all that other stuff. 

That doesn't fit Uber's business model. 




 According to the article, the owner of the office space must be the owner of the vehicle. I'm not sure what that would entail. A partnership amongst all the East Hampton Uber drivers? I don't know if that would be kosher. 



















 I don't understand this. Would it be more brave to kill them with artillery shells or a couple dozen M117's from a B-52? 




 Why not? Great oaks from tiny acorns grow. 









 All the upvotes for you, my friend. 




 [Not The Bees!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1GadTfGFvU) 




 Yes, that's what I heard. 

I expect they'll junk them, except maybe for some of the effects shots.  




 Could be a few people coming out of the woodwork now that the story is out. Predators rarely stop at one victim. 
























 How powerful does a computer have to be these days, really?

For a while I've been thinking about a tiny PC to replace all the devices connected to my TV. A full Windows PC would be great because then I'm not beholden to what apps are approved on what devices  and I can play any file in any format from my NAS.   




 It's unclear. The article mentions that Robbie will guest on The Flash and will guest on LOT, but won't be a series regular.

I could see maybe Garber/Stein being the main science guy, Robbie/Ronnie off doing something else and so we only get Firestorm in some of the episodes.

Could also be that someone else is the other half of Firestorm somewhere down the line. That happened in the comics too. 




 How would this make you look bad. If your boss is letting his subordinate pressure him into bad decisions, that's a pretty shitty boss. That should reflect terribly on him.  




 Call the mall management. Tell them what's happened. That you're owed money. You were fired illegally. And the store owner has enlisted mall security to harass you.

Then tell them that you'd prefer to resolve this quietly, but you'd be happy to go to the media if the situation isn't resolved. Be calm and polite, but firm.  




 I hope so. I wasn't too excited by the trailer, but I think that's something they just threw together quick for upfronts.  




 It's unlikely that any corporation would attempt to enforce these low level non-competes and it's even less likely that they would hold up in court. But that's not the point.

Your average, hourly worker doesn't know that these agreements are generally garbage and so they create a chilling effect on employees, who will be less likely to leave and seek new employment because of the agreement they signed.

Plus, low paid workers don't generally have access to legal representation if some vindictive business owner tries to enforce one out of spite. 




 When I first read through it, I thought that Garber had said that, now I see it's not clear. 




 "Robbie and I will be joined on the first episode of the (next) season of The Flash, and then we'll see what happens," Garber said. That leaves Amell not joining CW's Legends of Tomorrow universe as a series regular, though he's expected to make an appearance. 



















 Zart! 



















 Depends on what your company policy is. You and/or your supervisor might be disciplined in some way.

Either way, they have to pay you for all your time worked.
