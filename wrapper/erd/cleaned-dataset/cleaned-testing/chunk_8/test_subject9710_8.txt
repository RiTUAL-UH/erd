 I'm 20yo female who didn't really do any sports until I got to college (I did some swimming in middle school and marching band in high school, but nothing else). I started rowing in college three years ago and now I'm really dedicated and committed to that. But I've noticed on and off the water that I have less body awareness than my teammates. For example, when doing weights I can't tell if my spine is neutral or bent without a mirror or a partner. Are there any exercises--either physical or mental--that I can do to help increase my body awareness? This subreddit seemed like a good place to go but feel free to direct me somewhere else. 




 Wooooow 




 I think you're forgetting the mental skills required for this sport. Yes, all sports require mental skills, but rowing--particularly racing--requires some serious mental focus and toughness. Pushing your body to its absolute limits is not something your brain really wants to do, and it takes time and attention to really hone the necessary perseverance and to shut down that prominent self-preservation instinct. Don't neglect that in your considerations.  




 That's alarming
