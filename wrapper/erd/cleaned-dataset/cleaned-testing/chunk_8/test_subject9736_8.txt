* 30 Rock
* Futurama
* Freaks and Geeks (I know it's been mentioned already, but worth another mention)
* The Inbetweeners
* New Girl
* The Wonder Years
* The Walking Dead (except for most of Season 2)
* Derek
* The IT Crows
* The West Wing
* Black Mirror
* The Fall
* Lost
* My Name is Earl
* Malcolm in the Middle
* The Office (UK) 




 This kind of Hollywood studio greed ensures smaller VOD operators really don't have much of a chance, killing competition and helping piracy to thrive. And this could ironically lead to the studios' downfall - only the strongest operators survives, and a monopolistic behemoth is usually created as a result (ie. Netflix, or iTunes for music, Amazon for eBooks), someone that will end up having all the power to set the (licensing) terms in the future! 









 Still cheaper than Foxtel 




 Welcome to the club! 

I've found my Blu-ray buying rate halved since I started using Netflix (been geo-dodging for two years now). I had been wasting a lot of money on crappy movies, just because I wanted something new to watch. Netflix is now my source for all things crappy. 

The money I've saved have gone into going to the movies or buying movies that I actually like, thus reducing my pirated download rate as well.
