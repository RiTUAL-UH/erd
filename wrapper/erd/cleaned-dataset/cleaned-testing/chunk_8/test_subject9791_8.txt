 EXTREEEEEEMEEEE 




 All racing tyres will have that problem if you abuse them. locking up the tyres will have a detrimental effect, no matter which racing series as it introduces flat spots. It also will always cost you time. Hence it's better to have a smoother, cleaner driver, rather than balsy, locking up everywhere. Sure it looks much faster but in reality it will always be slower 




 Not just that. They do it in record time as well.  




 Exactly. But the commentators were too much trying to put WEC over that I cringed. WEC by itself is an entertaining sport, without needing comparisons 




 To be honest, I only caught the last 5 hours of WEC last weekend and seeing a Porsche so far in front, it was like watching F1

What annoys me tho was the commentary

"**More people are now switching from F1, because of factors such as sound**"

But most of the Diesel LMP1 car was totally SILENT, and usually the ones with the awesome sounds were from the GT class.

"**More and more F1 drivers seem to be coming to WEC**"

But that had been always the case. 

"**WEC provides wheel to wheel actions!**"

From what I understood that only happened up til nighttime, where the Porsche pulled a lead, and most of the overtaking after that happens in the pits
 




 Senna won't able to finish that race. The engineers revealed that he was carrying a slow puncture that they discovered after the race had finished 




 This was suggested by Bernie and immediately put down by EVERYONE. The drivers have sponsors tied to the team they are driving, and or bring sponsors to the team so logically this wont ever happen 




 She was backstage a few weeks back I think visiting  




 Bork wins from Rollins. Reigns vs Bork. Reigns win. Sheamus cashes in. We sympathies with Reigns.  









 I remember Massa spinning twice in that race due to seemingly overly sensitive throttle pedal or something.

A pity that Heikki can't make use of his pole, and slip down the order while his teammate dominated 









 Bourdais nearly won in 2009 with Peugeot altho he was dropped by STR later that year 




 They upgraded. Just that the upgrade was in the name of "making the engine more reliable" so they do not need to use any tokens. Look at their rear engine cover and you can see a bump. This is actually a larger cooler for their ERS system  




 I know about the upgrade, but they are using a new power unit, aka their 2nd out of 4 




 No pre boob job bella? 




 Maybe a context was needed. I was referring to the Mercedes breaking the Red Bull domination in F1 and dominating themselves

Porsche has just broken a 4 year Audi domination *cross finger that they do* 




 They were totally sandbagging /s 




 Porsche is doing a Mercedes this year. 

 




 left for toyota iirc 




 Merc have a new engine in Canada as both Canada and Austria stresses the engine quite hard 




 Thanks. To be honest I only saw a video of them talking in German and I just take the caption for granted as what they are actually saying 









 Fox Sports Asia that holds the South East Asia broadcast license usually have

- The broadcast

- Pit Lane Camera

- Dedicated Onboard

- Track map

- Live Timing

All which can be streamed at the same time from their website. So yeah, F1 has already offered all of this, but it depends on the broadcasting rights holder in your region 




 Was he fired in that segment? from what I remembered, Vince were just saying that he won't be rehired by WWF. Either that or I have a bad memory 




 "Any sound is just wasted energy"

- LMP1 engineer when Hybrid was first introduced 




 This is waaay smoother than the one Red Bull did 




 I am actually glad that Keith Apicary is not chosen

It was just a PR stunt, and choosing him would mean one less slot for a more appropriate person 




 Lots of reason

- Weather. The FIA need to make sure the race avoid the most extreme weather that the hosting country could achieve. This could be the Monsoon in Malaysia or the extreme summer in other places

- Tradition. Some races are traditionally in that date. For example Monaco is always near the end of May, and would usually be at the same weekend as the Indy 500. Canada would always follow it next, and then LeMans. If they can help it, they would usually make it that way. I think Brundle was saying that the FIA would usually assign the Monaco GP's date for the year, and work out the rest of the races from there.

- Host circuit calendar. They also need to see if the host circuit will have a free slot. Can't really plonk the race in a weekend where the host circuit has already agreed to do another race can we? 




 Note that there are teams, like Mercedes, that does not even have a nose that long. 

Some teams chose for a longer and droopier nose to pass the crash test, and with a pointy nose like that it certainly beat the purposes won't it? 




 Thanks for the heads up. I was pondering of buying the game since I thought I had missed the pre-order chance, i'd just buy it cheap during the Sales.

but meh. I'll just let this one skip. I haven't finished GTA IV and I doubt I would even finish this one 




 WWE also unmasked Alberto El Patron right? He was wrestling with a mask in Mexico 




 That being said, the Bentley did win in Silverstone last year, and totally trumped the opposition there. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOqyM2jNqqs 




 they liked it personally, just not openly or in a way that make they look like they are promoting it

Having it in the promo would mean Botchamania getting a free promo by the WWE, which they wouldn't likely to do. 




 Oh Pirelli is more than capable of that. Remember the Russian Grand Prix? 




 While it's not mentioned, the PS4 wheel does work on the PC as well 




 I have the Momo, G25 and now the thrustmaster T300RS. All were awesome in their own ways. The momo still feels like a real racing wheel til today 




 A steering wheel is different from a control stick, which emulates a controller 




 Licensing. It's either PS4/PC or XboxOne/PC.  




 Yeah, so Pirelli will be introducing plastics tyre to spice up the season in '17? /S 




 Flash paper iirc 




 Vickie was supposed to come out earlier, so Eddie had to improv. Hence the line 




 THE SHOCKMASTER! 




 Christian during his "One More Match" run with Randy Orton. His foot was under the ropes and that's how he gets his rematch 




 My white shirt is now tropicana coloured. Awesome video 




 better makeup and much more push in her bra 




 The Rock can't actually wrestle or bust more than 5 moves 




 He was queen controlled by Melina IIRC, and got into legitimate heat with other wrestlers for that. IMO some were concerned that Melina's decision was not what's the best for him 




 Something like last night is still okay. but a title run? They would hardly want it since they would need to bump on a daily basis, and both have serious injury problems before. They won't agree on that 









 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I-iUL2IBn4 




 Fibreglass maybe? The one in WM where Dean was thrown looks like fibreglass/wood 




 People said that WWE gave the WWE championship to the best wrestler in the company at the time, it would be given to TAKA 




 He was also interviewed for other series as well (Monday night Wars? I forgot) so he's not really blacklisted, just ignored 




 Mercs? 




 Cena was supposed to face Rock at Wrestlemania. CM Punk challenged Cena, if Cena lost, CM Punk will get that shot instead.

So we have a PPV Tier match between CM Punk and Cena on fucking RAW. It was so good because they busted out moves that they would never do. Punk with a piledriver and Cena with a hurracarana (kinda botched but that's beside the point). 

It was awesome because storytelling wise, they both want to win, and they are digging deep using moves that one would never imagine them to do
 




 Gotta disagree. I live in Asia, which is quite far away from US as you can get, but during AE, most of the males in the schools watches wrestling. Heck, majority of the grown up does as well. And at the time we did not even get RAW on free to air TV (only Superstars that have RAW recaps, RAW was on cable) but that did not stop kids from emulating The Rock, Stone Cold or Undertaker. 

What's more amazing was WCW was virtually non existent, even tho they were as large as WWF at the time. This is due to WWF's reaching out to oversea countries knowing that they would get more money while WCW which was bankrolled by Turner decided that they don't need outside exposure. And even without the Monday Night Wars, WWF still manage to gain mainstream appeal in my country.

The day I knew about the Monday Night War and WCW was when they were showing the episode of the Radicalz debuting on RAW, and a local newspaper that had a wrestling column suddenly talked about that defection 









 This make me wish that Kidman is still in shape, and join in the feud as well as the high flyer 




 What's next? Fake Kane? Fake Undertaker? 




 To be honest that looks better than Reigns's 




 R-Truth = fucking gold 




 "What is Hugh Morrus doing in the Impact Zone?" 




 They do teach them different styles, just under the radar. IIRC the performance centre would call up trainers who will teach the talents other styles like Lucha Libre, but adapted to the WWE style, aka safer and won't lead to serious injuries in the long run

Some of the radio messages on the Formula1.com site during the start of the race 




 1 - They stopped using the awesome JAVA based live timing because a few browsers (like Chrome) is stopping JAVA support in the future as well as smart phone browsers do not support JAVA. https://java.com/en/download/faq/chrome.xml

IMO the current live timing on the browser is good because not only it works for desktop browsers, but it also works for phone browsers as well

2 - The Live Commentary tab also has radio messages, some which are not even shown on the telecast

3 - Depending on who shows F1 in your country, they would also carry additional channels. For example, Fox Sports in Asia has a dedicated Onboard, Pit Lane and Track Map for each race that is accessible from their website 




 According to Brundle, its the downforce, aka the air will push on the wings and slow down the car during lift and coast  




 Only JBL and it's a running joke. Cole and Booker usually never do this

 Quote #54 

"A fan hit Goldberg with a cardboard Star of David" - The Wrestling Observer Newsletter: October 16, 2000 

Took me a while to remember that Goldberg is a Jew and this is ironic


Quote #160 

"Chris Jericho's final WCW match was 7/21 in Peoria, IL in a tag match teaming with Eddie against Kidman and Mysterio. Before the match, Jericho said that if he got pinned he'd leave WCW. Misterio than said everyone already knew it was his last night in WCW. (After the match) all four hugged in the ring. There were fans in near tears, as was Jericho. Kidman started a Jericho chant. Jericho said that he was overwhelmed by the response, but he still thinks that Peoria sucks" - The Wrestling Observer Newsletter: August 02, 1999 

The Curtain Call WCW style 









 My name is Finleh, I a LUUURRVE to fight! 




 I prefer a codec pack like CCCP or K-Lite + MPClassic. Better hardware rendering support, so it's lighter on your processor and faster than VLC

Also you can turn on web interface for MPC, and access it with your smart phone's browser at IP of the PC running MPC:13579 




 There are also games on the Xbox One that I want to play but are not released for the PC like Forza. Kinda looking forward to that streaming feature. Hopefully it will be as good as Steam In Home Streaming that I am using to stream games from my gaming PC under my desk to my Surface 3  









 It's the YET-TAY. 




 Is that the big gold belt? 




 I'm pretty sure it's not due to PG that WWE waters down their product, but due to Mattel which pays them a lot. 




 or X-Pac without the X-Pac heat 




 Yep. He's only over due to his awesome abilities. But he's sub par on the mic 




 Hideo's english is progressing nicely it seems 









 Hi Alex, 

First off, how different is driving an F1 car compared to a LeMans/endurance car?

Does it effect how you approach race? How do you pace yourself?

And how is it racing in a car shared with someone else? Does some leeway has to be taken when either drivers have a disagreement?

Thank you 




 Same thing happened with Codemaster's racing games so it's not really a Project Cars only issues. I usually set my location to UK-London even to I live in Asia to see any online lobbies 




 game EXE runs on one window, and a standalone telemetry exe runs on another? 




 Those games that were based on the original Gmotor/gmotor2 engine (rFactor, GTR, GTR2, GT legends, rFactor2, Shift, Shift2, etc) has an easy way to know where to brake when you turn off the racing line. Look for the darker patch of tarmac on the road. That's your braking point.

In any cases the patch is similar to the other color of the road, start braking where the rumble strip starts 




 The track cutting penalty is getting on my nerve when I'm racing online. But yeah, in terms of physics there is nothing much wrong with the PC version 




 For Assetto Corsa:

 It's actually the PS4 version of the game, not the PC

 Checklist for Teddy Long

- "Hold up playa"

- "Tag team match"

- "wrestler vs Da undatakah" 




 which means 6:30pm here and 7:30pm in Japan. FUCK YEAH I CAN WATCH IT AFTER WORK! 




 This is the logical step for Kunos. The success of Project Cars must have something to do with this decision. I'm actually happy as this means that the PC version will also have more contents. 

IMO though, the console and the PC version will not be quite similar. Modding would certainly be a PC version only. Most likely the console version will be a separate game altogether? 

ISI did this with the F1 Challenge game, where the playstation version differs highly from the PC version 




 http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2sjlye

Yep. Sorry about that. I forgot that Hamilton repassed. 




 Raikkonen passed Hamilton when they encountered a slow Williams, and then promptly spun.  




 Not really that aerodynamic but good lord it looks awesome 




 Not many, and most likely only high end. There are not many devices that utilises Thunderbolt currently hence the lack of it on many mid range devices.

With 3.0 sharing a connector type with the Type-C USB and the ability to use external GPU, I foresee it being slowly picked up much more in the next few years.  




 It's an Intel thing. and since Apple uses Intel's processor that's why you always see it on an Apple. 

For PCs, third party manufacturers like ASUS and MSI usually does not see a reason to include it on mid range motherboards and this helps keep the motherboard price down.  









 He praised it in Malaysia, which was Petronas home country. It was PR speak at the time 




 Japan '05 for me will always be the highlight for F1 in between '00 and '09 




 Due to TV changing the colour IIRC. McLaren uses dayglo orange during their Marlboro years because then it would look red in the TV broadcast and pictures 




 AKA McLaren Honda this year 




 IIRC the world feed is 50FPS (They are using PAL). Note that NTSC countries will be showing the feed at 60FPS, without the extra 10FPS advantage. 




 They are the new Diesel and Shawn, and I see them breaking up in less than a year.

If you want to see real bromance, Farooq and Bradshaw was much more believable TBH 




 Debut him in 2 weeks and let him cost KO his rematch against Cena. 




 He has no qualms with Vince, just the way Vince's wrestling works 









 Multiplayer on Project Cars is like the Formula 3 race at Monza yesterday

http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/119247 




 My mistake 

I am so sorry 




 Lack of grip. The right tyres are too cold and hence there is no confidence.

The SLS is heavier as well, needing a longer braking distance 




 Yep. And I don't look down on assist users. but right now it's a quick way to weed out the ones that are overenthusiastic. Nobody want to crash or ruin other people's race. But they lack the experience and judgement of people that are used to this methodological and patient racing. I mean if I grew up only playing Need for Speed I would be impatient and rash too. 




 He was never in TNA and if he is, WWE would make sure he can't use the same basic theme 




 for newer games that is highly likely. For older games, unless a patch comes out, no 




 Because Dirt Rally is an early access game that can only be played with STEAM? right? RIGHT? 




 Indeed. But when it leads to a better overall experience I don't see a problem. With ABS and TC on, a player would more likely to do the "Dive on the inside move" knowing that they would stop in time without thinking of the other car

Without both assist, one need to think where to brake without locking up, and when to throttle out without spinning, hence anyone that wants to stay on the black stuffs tends to be more diciplined 




 had a hard time reading some due to camera shake. Could you scan them instead OP? 




 Less than F1 definitely. Spec cars means cheaper series. Heck, one of the teams are even sponsored by KFC Indonesia 




 Ambrose and Reigns = Shawn and Diesel 




 They are willing to if they are not a direct competitor. NWA is mentioned many times, since the current NWA is basically an indie instead of it's old self. NJPW has been mentioned quite a number of times, especially when Brock is in the ring because NJPW won't trouble WWE in the states. ROH has been mentioned, as well as their tapes used/borrowed for WWE documentaries. 




 jacobpower-bomb her then 




 HUD Cycle button

You can also have the temp on you steering wheel if you don't want it on the HUD 




 Yep. First time driving the SLS and so was quite careful. Not to mention TC and ABS were off so I was extra careful hence underheating the tyres 




 what we did last night was set the ABS and traction control off, and have a 30 minute practice session. Once people realised that both were off, they left, leaving only legit racers in the server 









 Jibril is also known as the angel Gabriel in the western world.

IIRC Mikail = Michael. Have no idea if they translate the other 8 angel's name as well tho 




 Yes

Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCfET5-7NTo 




 Lita and Edge 




 14, but damn that was a good drive. He reeled in 3 **personal best** laps on the three last laps of the race. Considering that he was running low wing and the track is damp, that's remarkable.  




 In the live timing, what is the Red Square beside some of the names? 




 Similar to Sebastian Bourdais in '09 and Hulkenberg this year. They signed a contract to drive for other teams before they were confirmed for F1, and they are fulfilling their contract 




 Last week we see Rowland having to catch up from the back, this week it's Jazeman. Deja vu for Fortec 




 Sadly his performance is similar to his F1 performance 




 VIPleague stream is working but lagging quite badly 




 http://i.imgur.com/bVk5RL2.jpg

It has a cable that runs into the rear of the laptop.  




 unlikely. 8 twisted pair cables over an NIC is not really plugging directly into your PCI express lane speed. And it's faster to use STEAM In Home Streaming instead of trying to concoct a solution that would have been already created if it's feasible
