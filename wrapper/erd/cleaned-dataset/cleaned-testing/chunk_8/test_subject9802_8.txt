 My own fear of failure. I feel like I'd rather not try than try and fail, it seems... 




 Oh wow this would definitely take a lot of stress off someone's shoulders. I know it would for me, for sure. 




 This is awesome. You're a great person for encouraging this texter as well. You even told them about accent walls! Fuck yeah! Their babygirl is gonna have her blue room, fuck D! 




 Songs: Ohia is great!  
I like white denims earlier stuff. Can't conment on recent albums cuz I haven't heard them. :) 




 Awesome inspiration! What a great song and tattoo! 




 John Malkovich. 




 Thank you! These are all very helpful! I do have experience painting digitally but it's mostly cartoon stuff. I'm not very confident about making money with my art, sadly. You can check some of it out at http://faunus-crypticus.tumblr.com if you're curious, though! 




 I'm actually planning on registering for WWOOFing and have even emailed some farms as a start! That is exactly up my alley, though idk how I'd work out paying off bills while I volunteer. I'm sure I could sublet my apartment but I'd need to have some sort of income while I do it as I don't have and disposable income currently.  




 Oh, I don't have to leave the country; I just want to leave here. I don't think the military would be a good fit for me, however. I more just want to look into moving into the wilderness and maybe do WWOOFing or something :) 




 I saw this on her Instagram! Great work, can't wait to see the finished piece!  




 Hey there. I just discovered this sub and I'm not really sure how exactly I can change my life but I'm looking for any and all advice/help in getting things together.  

First a little history:  

 I grew up never really knowing what home was. I was abused, put into the foster care system and bounced around from 14-18. Never really knew anything about my father until I was 16 and reached out to him.  

My mom is a third generation American (Irish) and my father is an Israeli (his mother was born in Yemen, from what I understand). I grew up poor and without anyone teaching me how to be self sufficient. I had to learn all of that the hard way. From what I understand, my father was wealthy until he was arrested in 1988 for drug trafficking (he was the head of a local cocaine ring) and left us with nothing (the government seized everything and my mom tried to bribe him so he severed completely with the hopes that we would contact him later in life).  

Basically, for me, I just want to run away. I'm sick of the life I have and I've often dreamed of just getting out and living somewhere I can just garden, hunt, fish and live in the wilderness away from most people. I'm sick of having my income go mostly to keeping a roof over my head and bills, yet still not being able to afford to pay off my debt because I practically break even every month.  

The catch is that I don't have the skills to really live off the land and want so badly to be taken on as someone's apprentice (so to speak). I want to learn it all. I want to get out of the city and work my way up to being completely self sufficient. I'm at the point where I want to just drop everything and walk away from my life. I virtually want to commit suicide of my former self and just find the happy, free person that is dying to get out.  

Maybe this won't reach anyone that can help me, but even the slightest suggestions would matter so much to me.

 "Wanna go to a party where people wee on each other?" 




 Brass union used to be precinct. 




 Just because you *can* do that doesn't mean you *should*... 




 ^ this dude rules 




 That was my first thought, too! What an ugly building... 




 I see what you did there... 




 This made my day. Thank you for sharing it :)

 Watch the documentary "Beauty is Embarrassing" and you'll get your answer.  
They basically had their own behind the scenes puppet show going at all times. 




 Greek Salads....  Or pickles.  
I know they're considered healthy per se, but only eating the same thing is really unhealthy. I actually *did eat them every day* during a really hot summer that nothing else appetized me because hot food repulsed me and I lost an unhealthy amount of weight. 




 Gotcha. Just misinterpreted the question as emotionally destabilize rather than literally. My bad! 




 Some places slice the steak for you; it depends on the place. Usually they'll cut it for presentation but they'll let it sit to settle the juices a bit prior to slicing... I work at a (relatively nice) restaurant and we serve our NY strip sliced usually.  
 
I eat my steak as rare as the chef will allow it and only like mine seasoned with garlic, salt and pepper and MAYBE garnished with butter 




 I guess I didn't read "destabilize" as "cause war" and more so just felt that this pope is pretty rad and has made a lot of statements encouraging compassion to a lot of groups that had received a lot of hate (gays, evolutionary biology, etc) that if he was **assassinated** it would cause a lot of outrage.... Does that make sense? 




 The Pope... 




 "This isn't my first [time at the] rodeo" 




 Oh wow this is a great one :) 




 Awwww yiss! 




 Subtle; nice :) 




 Oh wow this is my favorite! 




 Do you have an isolated cutout of the protester? 




 Perfect. Hahaha :) 









 Redemption is a great rye! I was drinking Rittenhouse myself yesterday :)
Sorry you got mauled by your slicer! I almost ended up like you yesterday while using my friend's slicer that appears to be on steroids 




 HAHAHAHA I used to work with you at Apple in 2006/7! 




 Ha! This is perfect, thank you so much! :) 




 Yeah, that's the big reason why I'm okay with it, too but it'd be cool to have at least some feathered dinos like Archeopteryx or something :) 




 Dude, seriously. I know they're trying to be consistent but damn I'd love to see some feathered raptors. 




 Hahahahaha thanks so much, this is too perfect! I love sketching in blue, too. You managed to get our derp faces very well :) 




 Aww, thank you so much! You really captured his "I'm better than you, human" face :D

 Not very good at people or buildings/machines but I love drawing animals and creatures. I'm just looking for inspiration for silly doodles. 




 [Here's a quick doodle of the kitty...](http://i.imgur.com/ZOFOKLe.jpg) 




 This was a reunion episode for funny or die or something of that sort... It was mocking itself.


Edit: [it was Jimmy Fallon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW0SacO27Uk) 




 He just got fed but he's on a diet so that wouldn't surprise me.  









 RIP the liner of that pool 




 I stay home and order chinese food and try to watch as many movies as I can so I don't have to think about my family.  
Edit: I don't really have much of a family (even though they're alive). Alcohol helps if you're forced to be around them.  




 This is great. I completely agree. 




 It's okay, spunky monkey has a stick up his/her ass. While it's possible for the dog to have been flicked with water; it's doubtful the dog would stay in place while that happens to him (even if OP is holding a treat, a dog would think the flicking motion was OP throwing it and likely stand up). Also, we can't see the other side of the vest so we don't know if it's not drool or rainwater (it was sprinkling where I live today) or anything. Some people just really love to claim animal abuse with little to no evidence...  
I'm not absolving OP because my claims are as good as any other schmuck, but let's give OP benefit of the doubt.   SpunkyMonkey has already commented on this thread the same accusation quite a few times.

 Danny Elfman (the guy who does all the music for Tim Burton). This is his band Oingo Boingo. All of their stuff is so delightfully strange.  




 The Thesaurus. You may think I'm kidding, but I'm not.
