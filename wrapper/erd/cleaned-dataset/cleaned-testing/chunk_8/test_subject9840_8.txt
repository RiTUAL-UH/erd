 That is exactly why [Cronulla is no longer as good as when I was growing up](http://www.beachandbay.com.au/realestateblog/greenhills-beach-new-land-released-september-17/). 

Developers made a large donation to the state government, despite Sutherland Shire council strongly opposing it, in the end they had no say. $$$ 




 Do you prepare you clothes and belongings the night before? 




 When I didn't live in the city it was up by 6-6:30am to drive to the station and get the train between 7-7:30 and arrive in the city around 9am.
Now I live in the city I get up around 7:30 to get to work by 9am on the bus. 
But at the moment I wake up whenever I damn well feel like it because I'm on leave :) 




 Oh that's sad. I've had some good times here, especially when they've had some pretty awesome and unexpected free live music. 




 lol. Sounds delicious. I thought it would be okay because it's mostly older people in there... or does that make it not okay.  




 I guess it depends what type of person you and your friends are. Are you into outdoor stuff? Do you want to go drinking? Do you have other shared interests?

Anyway here's some ideas:

* [Paintball](http://ultimatepaintball.com.au/)

* [White Water Rafting in Penrith](http://www.penrithwhitewater.com.au/pages/whitewater-rafting.asp)

* [Skyzone Trampoline Dodgeball](http://www.skyzone.com.au/)
* Go to a bar with [board games](http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/bars/features/9737/top-five-bars-with-board-games). I know it might sound lame but board games can be fun! Just don't play ones where people get knocked out completely and have to sit around and wait for the game to be over.

* [Go Karting](http://www.kartatak.com.au/)

* [Surfing Lessons](http://manlysurfschool.com/)

* Book a room in a venue and hang out there for the night - beers + drinks sorted. I think there are a few places that will let you book rooms.

* [Murder Mystery Party](http://www.murdermysteryfun.com.au/) - You can also do this one yourself.

* [Luna Park Party](http://www.lunaparksydney.com/parties-groups)

 




 Lol. The older I get the more fun this sounds. :)  




 Thanks! After reading about all the pubs I've been to I feel like I must be a bit of a drunk. :) 




 I'd recommend [Lord Nelson's](http://www.lordnelsonbrewery.com/) in the city for a bit of historic Sydney charm.

Just down the road from that is the [Argyle Hotel](http://www.theargylerocks.com/) which actually appears on the $20 note - as it used to be called the [Argyle Stores](http://urbaneventsvenues.com.au/articles/2014/7/24/from-convicts-and-liquor-stores-to-dance-floors-a-history-of-the-argyle) which was a warehouse for ships a while back. It can get [busy on Friday nights](http://www.barsandnightclubs.com.au/assets/images/content/club/sydney//The%20Argyle%20Hotel%20-%20The%20Rocks/The%20Argyle%20Hotel%20-%20The%20Rocks%20-%20Sydney%20-%20Photo02.jpg) so head over before 6pm if you can.

There is another pub on one of the steep hills in the Rocks but more towards Wynyard, [Harts Pub](http://hartspub.com/hartspub/Welcome). It's quite old inside so has a bit of an old Sydney feel, but don't try walking down that hill when you're drunk.

A little bit further towards the bridge, is the [Australian Heritage Hotel](http://www.australianheritagehotel.com/). They do good pizzas here. This is your stereotypical Australian pub. It's a bit of a tourist attraction, but who cares, I like it anyway.

Another nearby key kind of place in the Rocks is [Push Bar](http://www.pushbar.com.au/). It's been renamed a couple of times so I get confused, but I like sitting around in here with 3-4 friends and some beers and/or cocktails.

If you're looking for views, head to [Opera Bar](http://operabar.com.au/) in Circular Quay. The [views from this bar](http://www.boudist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Opera-Bar-and-Kitchen__credit-Daniel_Boud-048.jpg) include the Harbour, Harbour Bridge and Opera House. It's only good when it's raining if you get a seat inside. 

There's a couple of little bars around but harder to find. Two of my favourites are [The Baxter Inn](http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/bars/venues/4904/baxter-inn) which is a whiskey bar, and [Palmer   Co](http://merivale.com.au/palmerandco) which is a 20's themed prohibition style bar. For both of these you need to get in early especially on Fridays, where they get busy any time from about 4pm onwards. There are a couple more small bars listed [here](http://www.urbanchicguides.com/top-10-sydney-small-bars/#.VThGhCGf4Q8) that I haven't tried yet, but I love the small bars. Keep in mind the drinks can be pricey at some of these places though, so if you specifically want to get drunk maybe head outside the city.  

Also because you specifically mentioned brews, I've got a couple of suggestions:
Lord Nelson is a brewery so go there.
There is also [Sydney Brewery](http://sydneybrewery.com/). It used to be called ["the Mac"](http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/the-macquarie-hotel-sydney) and I also heard somewhere it was called [the Scwartz](http://barzine.com.au/the-mac-surry-hills.html), but in any case, the rebranding has done them well. Their beers are not bad at all. 

*Edit: The Mac hotel/brewery is now Harpoon Harry's   apparently not as good anymore (see comments below this).*

If you're out at Manly, hit up [4 pines](http://4pinesbeer.com.au/). It's just across the road from the ferry. Beer is nice and food isn't bad either! You can get the ferry out there from Circular Quay (I think it's wharves 3 and 6 - there is a fast one and slower one). 

If you're more into Wine, check out [Wine Odyssey](http://www.wineodyssey.com.au/) in the Rocks. It's a bit touristy but the service is pretty nice. 

If you want to see stuff from high up, I have two suggestions. First is [Blu Bar at Shangri-La Hotel](http://www.shangri-la.com/sydney/shangrila/dining/bars-lounges/blu-bar-on-36/). Second is [O Bar](http://www.obardining.com.au/) located in Australia Square, which is poorly named because it's actually a cylindrical building near Wynyard. Keep in mind both these places are more expensive. Cocktails at Blu bar are around $20. Generally we just have one or two and enjoy the view. Or buy a bottle of wine and share it. 

If you're looking for something lower key, there are other places outside of the city. Within walking distance (via "the Domain" - a park) you can get to [Woolloomooloo Bay Hotel](http://www.woolloomooloobayhotel.com.au/). It has water views - good for a pub lunch and a beer. 

In Newtown there are a few hotels. I don't mind something simple, so [Coopers](http://coopershotel.com.au/) suits me and has a nice upstairs area. The [Bank Hotel](http://bankhotel.com.au/) used to be pretty popular but I haven't been there in ages so have no idea now. There is the [Marly Bar](http://marlboroughhotel.com.au/) which is a long standing Newtown Hotel. It may not the fanciest place ever but it's consistent. If you go here you can grab a bite to eat upstairs at [Miss Peaches](http://www.misspeaches.com.au/) which does Southern US soul food... though if you're from Canada you probably get better versions of it over there.

Hope that helps! I've tried all the bars I've mentioned so if you have any questions let us know. :)

 




 Rain itself isn't so bad. Rain + wind is not as fun.  




 I'd never even heard of a roast before this post. 




 Ah right, yeah I'm talking about city usage e.g. around uni. If I'm on rocks or snow then I've got a completely different set of criteria, and own a different set of clothes. 

The jacket I have is great for regular rainy weather, easy bushwalks, going out on boats (wind   sun protection), sitting on the beach/coastal walks in bad weather, walking around the city, etc. Nothing really intensive like climbing or going in the snow. It has no warmth protection other than being windproof, and to me is suitable for Sydney weather. 




 I've found Kathmandu okay, but really overpriced. There is no way I would pay full price for any of their stuff. The quality is just dependent on what you get. Those pocket-it rain jackets are cheap things. My favourite by far is the FILA jacket with the lining, but I got mine on sale for $50 - and a similar sort of jacket to mine is about $90 according to [the FILA site](http://www.fila.com.au/index.wsp/fila?page=ViewProduct StyleCode=ASJ10080 Cate=MENS grp=TOPS) but mine has pockets - I prefer it with the pockets. 




 Let it be water off a ducks back. You're doing things many people could never dream of. 




 I think it shouldn't necessarily have been "question" in that sentence. The examples given were more like statements e.g. "you'll change your mind". Maybe they should have said "It's not your place to make presumptions about me." Or "It's not your place to second guess me".  




 I caught the light rail after midnight on nys. It was packed though. Barely standing room.  




 Oh yeah I never noticed the start of a freeway sign. I feel silly now.  




 I've stayed at the Swissotel before. Parking is in a nearby secure parking garage and is $45 a day with in/out priviledges. You get one exit after checking out.  http://www.swissotel.com/hotels/sydney/explore-hotel/guest-services/ 

I've checked out a couple of others but they're all around the same price, often more.

Would he consider parking his car at the long-term parking at airport if he doesn't need it for the duration of his trip? Sounds like no from what you've said? 

Otherwise maybe a stayz place with a carspace would work. I stayed in one in Perth specifically for the car space.  

If you stay somewhere near a station, e.g. http://www.stayz.com.au/accommodation/nsw/sydney/mascot/79611 then he can walk to the station   jump on there to the city, which is a short train trip. I think it's about $15 extra per night to use the car space and you need to book it. 




 Ok, so this is the End Freeway sign I mean: http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/Freeways/GoreHillFreeway/Map/end%20freeway.JPG
http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/images/roads/safety-rules/roadrules/motorway-start-stop-signs.jpg

I think it's a barrier but my SO thinks it's a bridge.

I always thought it was a barrier because it's the end of the freeway, but he was saying that the feet are on either side because it's a bridge, and those types of overpasses are over freeways. Plus there are no more bridges, so maybe there are intersections with traffic lights coming up. That makes sense too! So now I don't know what it is. What do you think? 




 




 I hate it when anybody throws a verbal jab via a conversation with someone else. If you have an issue with someone, discuss it with them like an adult.  




 Good luck! 

Yes I have a shorter pair and longer pair. I don't really recommend getting longer ones - they're not that practical - the short ones are good tho :) 




 Honestly if it's in my direct path, I just pick it up and put it in the bin myself. I don't really care about getting my hands dirty. If it's really gross I have a pack of wet ones in my bag. 

I was standing at a bus stop and there was a newspaper from the local grocers flapping around all over the pavement. It was driving me nuts because it was about to blow everywhere. I just picked all the pieces up and put it in the bin, while the other 10+ people just stood there and let me do it. Maybe I'm a crazy old woman now or something but argh. I have nothing else to do but wait for the bus.  




 I got a FILA rain jacket for $50 at some place in Newcastle - one with the meshy lining is good so it doesn't get all sticky. I also have a Kathmandu one that I got on sale with the meshy stuff.

Kathmandu have pocket-it ones too if you want something really lightweight you can carry around. You can view them [here](http://www.kathmandu.com.au/mens/jackets/rainwear.html#!p=2 offset=1948) - just search for pocket-it.

I reckon the meshy lining is worth it though - makes it much less sticky. 

You can also get them from Big W but with this weather they'll probably all be sold out in your size. Best time to buy a rain jacket is not when it's raining unfortunately. 

If you're going to be doing a lot of walking in the rain get some rain pants too that you can wear over your regular pants. [Example](http://www.kathmandu.com.au/mens/trousers/full-length/pocket-it-rain-trousers-v2-black-6.html)

Another place that is pretty good is Uniqlo. They're more budget end but they have nice stuff.
e.g. [Shorter jacket](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-light-pocketable-hooded-jacket-139257.html#53)
or you can get a [longer one](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-waterproof-pocketable-coat-139291.html#69)

For gumboots I reckon [Wellies](https://www.wellies.com.au/) is great - I've bought some through there before and they're pretty nice. 




 I think this is really important. Being able to know who you are on your own first means that you don't rely on another person for your life to be complete. Your life can be complete as an individual. I think it comes from the knowledge that you can enjoy life on your own - and I don't know if many people get to experience that, or if they are too worried about finding an SO to live in the moment. I have fond memories of some of the times I travelled alone and it has stuck with me. I'm not saying that I don't like being around people, or having people in my life, just that I know that my happiness is not dependent on the relationship, the relationship is just a beautiful addition.  




 :( I never could. Maybe you just have to learn to live with it. Accept it and move on and after a bit of time the sadness will be more distant.  




 Wounds heal but scars remain. 




 I've done some through Vistaprint. They were pretty good.  




 :( Maybe you need a break from the searching for a while? Focus on some stuff that you really want to do with your life?  




 I'm average but I sometimes just don't care. I've got too much going on in my head to give a crap about what I look like on the outside. 




 You have beautiful hair 




 My sister tells me not to buy her kids gifts. She said she doesn't want them to grow up expecting stuff. She always tells me that just me being there is enough. So glad I don't have family like the one who wrote the letter. 




 Find something they don't really give a toss about and don't want to do... like say, being a blood spatter expert or a mortician who specializes in embalming. When they say they have no interest in that, explain to them that it's just a phase and they will change their minds when they're older. Or... this works well for an embalmer... tell them they just haven't met the right person yet. If they don't get the picture throw in some visual imagery of draining blood and replacing them with embalming fluid to remove the rigomortis. Then explain how when people die they are sometimes purple and a good mortician should know how to apply makeup. If it's not setting in yet describe the smell of rotting flesh and the gases output by bacteria that takes over your body after you die.

Sometimes you just know what you don't want. 




 The only problem is that question just fuels them to explain more about how they can't sleep because it's uncomfortable. 

Best to just remove their feed from yours or unfriend them. They're annoying while pregnant with twins... it's only going to get worse. 




 My dad was the only person to give me a good response to saying I didn't want kids. 

He said... "It's up to you if you want to have kids or don't want to. There are pros and cons to both. If I didn't have kids I could have done other things that I didn't do because I had them. " 

He did add at the end "But if you do want them, it's best to do it before 35." But that's the doctor in him talking. 

Anyway, I don't know but that was one of the best conversations we've ever had. It just felt like a weight had been lifted from me. 




 Maybe he's just tired and that's how he sleeps. 




 I didn't know about this. Sounds pretty good. The data isn't unlimited, but it's heaps.

"This plan includes unlimited standard talk, text, MMS and voicemail plus 500MB of data within Australia at a cost of $2 a day." 




 I wouldn't rely on it. I'd probably just get a SIM. 




 ALDI https://www.aldimobile.com.au/ 

One prepaid plan has 3GB for 30 days for $30
https://www.aldimobile.com.au/plans/datapacks
I think it's 3G not 4G but still cheap, and on Telstra which has the best coverage.

When I was in the US I just got a data pack and used Skype to make calls.
 




 My boss asked me to let him know when we're planning to have kids. Umm... even if I was planning them, which I'm not, I'm not going to let you know!!

(On phone) "Hi boss. Just letting you know we're about to copulate. Any day now. "

Yeah uhh no. 




 I've had mixed results depending on who it is. My school counsellor wasn't very good and gave me some terrible advice.

I see a psychologist now who is really good, and understands most of what I need from the sessions. The first session should be kind of a getting to know you thing. You can talk about anything that is bothering you - no matter how minor it might seem. I don't know what it's like for everyone else but for me it is about gaining a better understanding of myself and as a result learning better coping skills. I have had periods where I felt I could do it alone but then I crumble over time, so I keep going back. When things are better I go less frequently, and when they're bad I go often.  




 What type of counselling is it? Are you going to a psychologist or something else? 




 Thanks! :)  




 I guess you just have to choose something and go for it. Is there anything you really want for your life? 




 I'm in my 30s from Australia. 




 I just finished paying off my debt last year. Yay! Except I'm old now. 




 I wish someone would tell this to people in Sydney where the median house price is above AUD$1m (over US$780k). :( 




 Well if you need to talk... I'm here. I have no experience with family separation but I can be a good listener. My parents separated when I was young too.

I also found this booklet about coping with going through a separation (including when you have kids). Maybe it will help you to think about a few key things. 
http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/publications/cs1144
 




 I am like you, my brain just won't stop. I have a lot of trouble sleeping, and it makes my depression even worse. Sometimes I keep myself busy only to have nightmares because all those repressed feelings are coming out when I sleep.

What makes you think you're a failure? 

I have found going through this process works for me a little. Maybe you can try it and see how you go? I usually like to write it out because it gets it out of my head and onto paper. 

1. Notice you're feeling uncomfortable emotions. 

2. Identify all the emotions you're feeling - angry, sad, frustrated, annoyed, etc. 

3. Once you've done that try to rationalise them - why do I feel this way? Did I do something or did someone else do something to make me feel like this? 

4. Figure out - is your feeling/reaction helpful? If No - then you need to let it go e.g. by forgiving yourself. If Yes - work out what action you can take and when. Then until you can take that action, leave it aside and don't think about it anymore, until the time you take the action.

 




 I see. I hope you can get through it. Another option could be to change schools. Is that something that may be possible for you? Maybe now you've lost weight people won't have that image of you. Can you talk to your parents about it and see if they have any ideas for how to deal with it?  




 Well I used to know someone in school who used to have good comebacks. So when someone would call him fat he'd yell at them and say "At least you can fix fat, you can't fix ugly!". Maybe you can make jokes about them back and see if they ease up. If it doesn't help, then maybe you could try talking to a school teacher or counsellor for advice on how to deal with it. They might be able to sit down and have a simple chat with you and your friends and talk about it between you and what is acceptable behaviour, because I can tell you that is not how a friend should be treating you. 




 There are a lot of people standing around outside business services like it is recess. No wonder the trains were always late.  




 First, congrats on losing 40 pounds. That's amazing! I am trying to lose a bit of weight too and it's so hard so I can appreciate the effort that must have gone into that. That is an incredible achievement right there! If you have a healthy BMI then that's even better. :) 

It sucks that people are picking on you. Please try not to let them bring you down. Either they are saying mean things unintentionally without realising how much it is hurting you or they have an ugly personality and are really trying to bring other people down to make themselves feel better. If you think people are doing it unintentionally, you can ask them not to, perhaps they don't realise what they're saying. If people are doing it intentionally then ignore them, and remind yourself of your achievements already, because it is no small feat to lose weight. It takes an incredible amount of self control and determination.  

Can I ask how old you are? Are you in highschool? People in highschool pretty much suck. I had one person come into my highschool and give a talk about how highschool matters so much and how you'll reflect on it being the best days of your life. I can tell you they were WRONG about my life. Sure, maybe for them it was the highlight, but for me there was so much more beyond school, and for me at least it was a lot better.  




 I think the first step is acknowledgement and acceptance of what's happened. Yes, it is utterly shit that this situation happened. It sucks that when you needed to and chose to confide in someone in confidence they broke your trust and your life got screwed over. You were just looking for a shoulder to lean on and instead you lost a future you had envisaged for yourself, and now you're going down what you feel like is a lesser path. Ok yeah, that sucks. I won't sugarcoat it because that's a pretty raw deal you got. But part of accepting it is realising that it's in the past, and the future doesn't have to be the same. You can change the future - you have that power! And it can be a different path and still good.

So the next step is to decide what you're going to do now. Ok, so you picked community college. What are you studying? Do you like it? Do you want to continue? If not then what other options are available to you? Do you see any of them as things you'd like to do? Sometimes I find it helpful to think about problems as if I was an outsider and it was a friend in the same situation as me - what advice might you give them? At this point maybe all the choices you want to be available to you aren't, but that's okay, if it's something you want then there should be other ways to get there.

You might not feel like doing all this, I get it, but you're in a bit of a slump and you are the only one who can climb out of it. Sure you can lean on others for support - maybe if you don't feel like you can trust the mental health system, instead try anonymous support phone lines or chat rooms for support. Start by setting yourself small goals to begin with and try to take each day at a time, focusing on making each day count. You might still have bumps in the road but each day you do something positive is a step in the right direction. 

Don't give up. You can still have a good life, it's just that now you're travelling a slightly different path than the one you previously had in mind...  




 :'( I'm sorry to hear that. I'm glad that you got through to talk to someone though, and that they were able to help. Hopefully now you have somewhere to call next time too. 




 Thanks! This is really interesting. Do you know how many public holidays each of these places gets a year? That's also paid work in Australia - Are public holidays paid to full-time staff in most other countries? 




 Did you get through to anyone?  




 I know this message is late but I am going to write it anyway, in the hope that you do read it. 

Please reach out to someone, anyone, and talk it through with someone, even reddit if that's all there is. I don't know what your situation is but I hope you can get through this and if you do I hope you read this and consider that strangers on the internet care enough to write a plea to you and beg for you to reconsider. You must be in a lot of pain, but know that you don't have to be alone.  




 Try not to be too hard on yourself. Interviews are not particularly good at judging someone's aptitude, so in terms of an entrance requirement they kind of suck. 

Is there something else you could consider studying? I've been rejected from a course I wanted to do and I did something else instead. It turned out to be a better choice for me, maybe there is something else for you?

If you are sure you want to do floristry and horticulture maybe you could try getting some experience in a florist, so when you apply you have some experience in it. Then if you were to apply in January next year they should look on that favourably and you will also have improved yourself. Usually there is more than one road that leads to the same destination. 

What do you think? 




 Can I ask what problem it is that you're trying to discuss? Perhaps it would help in finding a suitable person to talk to? If you don't feel comfortable saying so, then it's okay. 




 Oh man, I can't believe how hard it is for you to get through to someone. :( 

Perhaps you could try the suicide hotline again? It sounds like the person you spoke to wasn't very good, but there might be others that work there that are. 

Is it an option for you to go see a doctor? They might be able to refer you to a counsellor or something. If you are able to get through tonight then I suggest this. 

If you're really struggling to find someone to talk to perhaps a church minister would also be an option. Personally I'm not religious but if you just need someone to lend an ear perhaps it might help. Again it depends who you talk to, but they may be able to spare some time with you and really listen to you. Some churches offer counselling services that charge a small fee based on a sliding scale depending on income. 

Just trying to throw some options out there. I hope you can find someone.

Please don't give up though.    




 Which siuicide hotline did you call? Was it this one? http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/ 

You could try some of the numbers here, though I can't tell you which are any good - sorry: http://psychcentral.com/lib/telephone-hotlines-and-help-lines/000173  




 I should have mentioned that there is a grieving process, and you will go through it. I think it's important to know that no one way of grieving is the right way, and you will have your own way of dealing with it. The way I have gotten through it is to do my best to be a better person. She was studying to be a psychiatrist. She was beautiful and smart and caring. I can't replace her but I do try my best to be a better person. 

I also had a friend last year who passed away suddenly one weekend. He was 32 and he had an undiagnosed heart condition. He was so happy with his life and he was out celebrating the birthday of his beautiful girlfriend the night before. I had spoken to him on the friday and he was showing me all the arrangements he had made - he had gone to so much effort to make her happy. In stark contrast to my school friend he wanted so much to live. He had a beautiful life laid out for him and he only needed a chance to live it.

I took a few months off to figure out what it is that I want from life. I make more time for the people I care about, I make more time for myself, I won't let work take over my life again, I will do the things that I have always said I would do but got too busy to do before. I will try my best to help those in need. I also realised that I would never take my own life because I couldn't stand the suffering that it would cause.

To be honest there is nothing that can take the pain away from losing a dear friend. But over time you will find a way to cope, and if you can, you will find a way to make your life matter. I wish you the best of luck, and never feel like you are alone. If you ever need someone to talk to who knows what it's like... I'm here for you. 




 My best friend from high school committed suicide last August. The last time we talked she was moving cities and I said I would try to catch up with her and never did. I thought it was only 6 months but when I looked back at my facebook messages it was over a year and a half. 

I was really upset. We went through everything in highschool together, and to know that she felt so alone and felt like she had nowhere to go for help killed me inside. I was on holiday when I found out and I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I wasn't balling my eyes out or anything until the funeral. I didn't even take tissues because I didn't know how I was going to react but as soon as I saw her coffin, and pictured her lifeless body in there it just broke something in me. I bawled my eyes out. She didn't deserve this, and her family and friends didn't deserve it. I was mostly angry at myself for being too busy with work and not putting in the time to go see her.

I don't know what to say to console you, I suppose I just want to tell you that I know something like what you're going through. It still upsets me. She left a note but her family chose not to share it. I don't know how she did it and in some ways it doesn't matter - it's done. There is a pain inside me that will never go away, and I wish so much that I could go back in time and save her. I wish so much that she was still here. 




 If you can't find a number try this: http://www.7cupsoftea.com/ 




 What country are you in? I only know Australian support numbers :( 




 A brain injury is no small thing, and thank goodness your mum cares about you enough to ensure you got the right diagnosis and treatment. I have had a series of sports injuries including a recent concussion, and it's nothing to mess about with. I lost my vision too for a short time and then fell asleep for a few hours straight after. Mine wasn't as serious as yours but it's been weeks now and I'm still feeling the effects of it. 

I'm so sorry to hear about your girlfriend. Maybe she still cares about you, and it sounds like she was hurt because to her it might have seemed like you were emotionally cheating. I can hear that's not true, because you still care for her, but she must be having a very hard time seeing that. Maybe when you feel up to it you can try talking to her and explaining this again to her - when it's less fresh. It might not be too late. However I can speak from experience that distance relationships are very difficult and trust is so important, so if trust can't be built, then it might be a very difficult relationship to maintain. 

You sound like you're still young, and yes, things haven't gone well for you. But you sound like you have the resilience to keep going and working on improving things. Perhaps the best thing is to focus on your recovery first and foremost. 

Also just a tip from someone who has been riddled with injuries - try not to binge eat too much junk food. I did that when I was injured and really depressed and it's really hard hard work to get rid of. Focus on your health - good eating habits will also help you sleep better and will aid your recovery.   




 :( You sound exhausted. Have you considered consulting a financial advisor who can help you with your finances? It sounds like you're really trying to make the situation better but perhaps you don't have all the tools you need to get out of it. Perhaps if you can't spare the time and/or money you can try asking on reddit for a free place to call to get assistance? I don't know the right sub for this, but maybe try /r/personalfinance . Sometimes it might just be a matter of getting an outsider to take a look and see what other options might be available to you. 

 




 Was there some criticism in particular that you had difficulty taking on? Was it constructive or was it just plain hurtful? Do you think it could be in your interpretation of their statement or do you think that's how the message was intended? 




 First question is - do you think you will like speech therapy? And what other options do you have? The best way to go about this is to think about all the options available and weigh up the pros and cons. Then you might have a clearer picture about whether you're making the best choice from a few available choices.

In terms of student debts, you have to think about if the investment is worth it? What else could you do with the time and money? If programming is an option you're considering, is that something you would enjoy doing? 

While education is an investment and I generally feel it is worthwhile, if you aren't improving your outcomes then you really need to think about what your options are. It sounds like you're clever enough to be in the position to have choices, which is good, but it sounds like it is agonising not knowing which path to choose.

Don't worry about what society expects, think about what you want from your life. Some people would be fine in carrying the student debt because they are passionate about what they want out of life and know that's what they want to do and the study will enable that. There is no right or wrong. It's really a personal choice, and so you need to try to think rationally about what it is that you personally want from your life.   




 Also can everyone please occasionally check that both headlights are working? I nearly drove straight into a one headlight car thinking it was a motorbike.  




 How did everything go for you? 




 I thought I was the only one concerned about the big knife. Is there some reason to carry a knife around there? Is there a birthday cake cutting or something?  




 It's not that I don't understand this and I accept it. I don't hate the guys who are looking for a date or anything like that. I was just opening up a perspective that perhaps a lot of engineers and IT guys may not have thought about.

Also I guess I'm saying that if you're willing to be a friend to someone without trying to get them to go on a date with you straight up, then you might have more luck. I ended up with a couple of guys that way (just to be clear, not at the same time!). 




 This is a great idea. They should sell them at the change room from bungee jumps in discreet vending machines. 




 If you're interested in buying an apartment request a Section 109 certificate. (http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Buying_property/Buying_into_a_strata_scheme.page )
Main thing to pay attention to is any financial issues or special by-laws.

You can have a small sense of community if you get involved in the executive committee which helps run the building - but I warn you - it is a lot of work. It's nice to be a part of running the building though an awful lot goes into it that you don't realise unless you're on an EC and it can suck the fun out of it. It's also frustrating living in a building with a lot of tenants moving in and out who don't give a crap about the building and leave their rubbish every time they move out. For me it has been an eye-opening experience.

Given the choice I'd choose a house every time. It's not that much fun hearing your neighbours have sex in the bedroom above you at 1am - loud enough to actually wake you from your sleep. It's also not fun when they decide to have a large party in a tiny apartment on a weeknight cause they're uni students and you have to work the next day. Also smoke drifting in from your pot smoking neighbours, or people who own dogs that bark constantly, or when the upstairs neighbours install floorboards so now you can hear everything they're doing... etc. etc. 

Honestly I try not to get too friendly with neighbours. We live too close together to be friends. I can hear all their conversations from my neighbouring unit. I hear when the ones upstairs pee in their toilet. I can hear the tv shows the neighbours on the other side watch. Ever heard that phrase good fences make good neighbours? Well we don't have fences. I say hello and if we bump into each other in the foyer then we might discuss the latest building news, but that's about it. 

On the plus side, it's cheaper.  




 You can wear non ads on your shirts too. Like inanimate objects like I dunno a tree, the moon, etc. Just to make it interesting... for decoration... like a Christmas tree. 




 ... a trip to the Maldives where I went scuba diving for the first time, saw whale sharks (I didn't even know about them before I went!), saw reef sharks, saw stingrays feeding out of a Maldivian man's hands, saw a whole bunch of cool fish I'd never seen before when we went snorkelling with a marine biologist, went stand up paddleboarding, went swimming, saw a giant sting ray swim casually below our villa, stayed in luxury and saw the other islands too, but in the end had the best time of my life. I also met an older couple there who were a lot like us but 50 years down the track with no kids and seemed totally happy and that was the best wedding gift anyone could have given me and my husband - to see it was possible first hand. And to see a bunch of beautiful coral atolls was amazing. I'd learnt about them in school and never imagined I'd actually get to go there!

Since then we've met a lot of happy couples without kids on our travels overseas and after that I have no doubt that whatever happens I will live an interesting rich life full of experiences whatever they may be.  




 What about brothers/sisters? 'cause if I ever did this to one of our pets, I could easily be expecting a bruising from my siblings. Not that I ever did this, because I love animals. I did a rubber band slingshot into my brother and he made a better one than mine and slingshotted me back, so I got a bruise for a week like a paintball spot. I never tried to slingshoot him again.  




 Thing is I think he's trying to be nice. And I do want a slightly lower workload because I don't want to work 18 hour days and weekends anymore. I want to be able to work more sane hours like other people in my company do. They just won't put those people on the out-there projects like I get because they have a family... argh. I guess I just didn't need it to be framed that way to me. 




 The other thing is I don't even want kids but my boss is telling me he wants to lower my workload you know... just in case... because I'm around that age. Wtf? I told him outright I had no plans to. I feel sidelined. (Btw I'm female) 

Kids are hurting my career and I don't even want to have any! 




 This is messed up. Why oh why? Whatever happened to leaving things to the imagination? One day those kids will see those photos on Facebook of their parents and them naked for the whole world to see. I think I would die inside from internal cringing.  




 It's a weird idea because from what I've seen and experienced is that men with kids go home much earlier than men without. I am more surprised by this statistic than by women with children earning less than cf women, because this just seems so counter intuitive to me. 




 What about people who post photos with their baby while they and their baby are naked and then they get their husband naked too so they can show me how bare they can get. I don't need to see that. Just like you don't need to see me naked on your Facebook feed. 




 This makes me feel as if the person who wrote this quote has never done anything worthwhile in their life.  




 This sounds weird but could it be that men want kids to keep their mothers happy? As a wife I used to get a lot of pressure (which of course was unseen by my husband) to have kids from my mother in law. I can see how that could affect some men.  




 I'm so sorry to hear this, and I don't know what to say. It hurts to feel like you were on the same track and then things suddenly changed, and you got hurt. Just know that just as you can have a fulfilling life without kids, you can also have a fulfilling life without him. And you're not just an incubator, you have so much more to offer. Don't forget that! Hugs.   




 I left a lot of friends behind because of this type of thing. I hope you do find friends who will better understand you. You're growing apart because of life changes. It sucks they can only see their perspective. I won't say the attitude will change but I do hope you find friends who don't diminish your life experiences because they somehow think theirs are more significant. 




 I don't understand why men would get promotions from having kids. Is it perception that men that have kids are more successful or something, leading to a promotion?  Like in the way that taller men get promoted/hired more readily?  




 Not sure... maybe it's having kids? Maybe you're already half way there so may as well see it through? Maybe you have more control over your life and circumstances by then and feel less inability to change the things you don't like? Maybe if you were going to do it you already would have? Maybe other life threatening illnesses just happen more.. suicide rate may be the same. 




 It's probably because he feels like he isn't good at helping him. I remember when my parents split my mum would talk about it with me and for a while I let her let it out but after a year it got a bit much for me because she was crying all the time and I couldn't help her. I asked her if she could talk to someone like a counselor or something because I could see I wasn't helping and it was also upsetting me a lot. I wasn't trying to be mean and I wanted to help but I was too close to be impartial. She did find someone to talk to and she gradually improved over a few months. Maybe he just didn't know how to help or didn't have the skills to.  




 Do you mean total power loss or just performance reduction?  




 Wow you actually have NBN! I thought it was a myth!  




 I have an idea for improving the show. I'd like to see commenters from /r/diy explaining how each of the renovators have screwed up. Or I could just go read that sub instead I guess... 




 You know how when you're in high school you have a certain group of friends, and you think you're pretty close, but then when you leave school it changes, and you may still talk to your high school friends but you make new friends, ones you have more in common with. Those friends understand you and what you're going through at that time, usually because circumstances have changed. Your high school friends might have a different vocation, and not understand you as much anymore. They're still nice people and all but you just don't connect like you used to. Then when you get a job you make a new set of friends, 'work friends', who understand how things are at work, and you share your experiences and lean on and trust each other for support.

I think even romantic relationships can be like that. There are people who you need at different points in your life. Some people think they will find 'the one' who they will spend the rest of their lives with and sometimes that is the case. But often people need different people at different stages of life, and that is okay. Also one person often can't fulfill all your needs. Sometimes you need friends to fill the gaps. 

I think the next steps for you are to first see if your discontent can be resolved, and if it can't then I'm sorry to say that you will need to work out a way to move forward without her. 

Starting with the first step though I think you should talk to her. Tell her how you feel and ask her how she feels about the situation.  Ask her for ideas and discuss ways things could be better. Consider making a plan together to improve things and then you are both aware of the steps forward.

If you really already resent her then I think that you need to stop thinking as if breaking up with her would be hurting her, because staying with her hurts both of you, and even though it's hard it is often the best thing to do in that situation. 
 




 You're probably better off just buying a new one. There's a Reece at Taren Point. See if they're open tomorrow and go get one. Then you just need an electrician to connect it. The pipes are the simple part.
