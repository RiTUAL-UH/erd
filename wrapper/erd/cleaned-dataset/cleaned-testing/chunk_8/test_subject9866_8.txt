 Damn man, that has to fucking suck. I'm sorry. 




 Who wasn't? 




 Sigmund Freud often gave cocaine to friends and family as party gifts. Why? Well, because he loved cocaine.

 Should I size up? Or would my normal size suffice. 




 You just gotta go on the right days. I've seen Blazer Mids, Dunks, some Gel-Lyte 5s once, and a few pairs of Janoskis. 




 Your name is amazing. 




 They have like 9 pairs at my local Ross lol. I was going to cop but they didn't have my god damned size. 




 Have the Air Mags been confirmed to have power lacing? Last I heard it was still a rumor. 




 Nice find man. Ross is one of those stores where if you go on the right days you'll find some nice shit. 




 How do they fit? I've been looking into these recently and was wondering 




 Ah, a classic 




 Did that because I kind of took it as a title that *is* a question rather than a question itself. I don't usually type like that.

 This fit is the best one I've seen here. I think I'm a bit biased though because I'm into photography and this is also the best taken photo I've seen so far lol.

Good shit man 




 Yeah lol. I've seen a few pairs of Janoski's at mine, but never in my god damned size 




 Almost did this the other day lol. I noticed the buttons were on the left and was just like "something fishy's goin on right now" 




 Nice cop man! I found that Nike SB hat which I didn't end up buying, and [This one] (http://i.imgur.com/IsCOwEk.jpg) which I *did* end up buying. You just have to go on the right days and you can find some good shit 




 The Host With The Most. 




 It's about the best you can get around here yeah. I have 50/50mbps and works absolutely fine for me
