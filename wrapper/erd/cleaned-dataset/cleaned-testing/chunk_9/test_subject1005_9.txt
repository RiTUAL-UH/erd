 Everyone seems to disagree on the definition of plot holes and cameos. This sub also can't seem to make up their mind on Marvel movies. Any time these are mentioned, hilarious arguments ensue. What else?  




 I feel like I have to like your username 




 The Mummy Returns doesn't even have a title.  




 Maybe OP wants to give an example of what he means? What writing are you referring to? Dialogue, plot, scene structure? I feel like this is a confusing post.  




 Honestly, I'm humbled by the efforts in this post and really, really wish I could make a contribution. I'm usually that guy who ruins the on-going joke, so best leave it to people like you and u/MarkyMark8 to do the honors. Thank you guys :) 




 Cracked did an article years ago about mismatched fights in action movies. Commando was mentioned. The writer described Bennett hysterically. Something to the effect of "he looks like the fat kid in the pool who doesn't take his shirt off" and "he's dressed like he's on the receiving end of bondage." Good shit.  




 John.....I'll be waiting John... 




 I don't know the best....but I know the worst....Bennett from Commando. Are you fucking kidding me with this name? 




 wat 




 This was fantastic! I could seriously hear the laugh track in my head at certain parts. After posting, I thought this may be trickier than Seinfeld as Frasier uses a lot of more.....cultured?....references, but you really tackled them here. I'd def be down to read more if you're inclined :) 




 You'll have to forgive me, as I don't write for Seinfeld, but my understand is you can give a writing prompt- a situation each character is going through- and then let other redditors fill in the dialogue with what they believe will be said by the characters. Maybe something like  'Frasier accidentally ruins the ending of a movie on his show, prompting major backlash from his listeners and Roz herself.' Just an idea.  




 Kind of like keeping the show going, but without changing what happened. Like it if you were to pick up somewhere in the middle of the show. 




 Its the same format used in https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditWritesSeinfeld  




 I'm sure everyone will appreciate it! Thanks! 




 I'll be waiting at Duke's. 




 I love what Reddit does for Seinfeld, and with the amount of love this sub gets, I have to think that one of you could put together a scene. I don't possess that unique talent, but does anyone here want to give it a try?
Maybe to help get these started, I'll use a prompt I used in one of the comment below 
**After accidentally ruining the ending of a new movie on his radio show, Frasier faces major backlash from Seattle and Roz who really wanted to see it. Meanwhile Niles believes he is getting a dog allergy to Eddie**
Maybe something like that? 




 Daphne's Room is my favorite. So. Damn. Funny.  




 I could not agree more. Aaron is the man. But that actor is terminally attached to Secret Service and law enforcement roles.  




 To football! 









 Maybe I'm not thinking clearly, but who is Gru? 




 Nah it's cool. Your comment also made me remember that he beat the hell out of that security guard in the beginning and we never find out if he killed him or not.  




 These are all good points, but I feel like my point may be lost in interpretation. I'm saying he never actually killed anyone that we're aware of. 




 Yeah, it's a technicality for sure. But he still didn't take the life himself. Might as well have though.  




 Yeah, solid answer Truly sick.  




 Really interesting answer lol It has been a while since I've seen Congo, but I thought they did kill some people? 




 I was watching Nightcrawler with my lady and realized what a complete sociopath Lou is, despite killing anyone. Who else comes to mind? 




 But you know real cash from play money right? Buy-ins are $50 




 Yeah I guess I am just seeing it in ridiculous situations. Everyone starts with 1,500 chips. A players loses maybe 600 of theirs in a hand. The next hand, the shove with their 900. It just doesn't make sense. .
