 LoL! I don't think my managers and the police would be as forgiving this time of it happened. It would be horrible if it malfunctioned and went off tonight without me touching it. They'd never believe me! 




 My God! She is an idiot! I don't understand why someone would press it if they had already been warned about what it does!? Ugh. People. Thankful, no one got fined or anything because it hasn't happened before and we already warned them that it was malfunctioning! 




 Trust me! Had I known what it was, I never would have touched it! I had just never even been told there was one! 

Also, who's Carol? 




 Thank you! I'm working now, and I have no idea if it's working. I'm not testing it though! 




 Seriously! We're a college town, so the college has its own police force leaving the rest of the town to the others. Not much left in this town if you take the college away 




 That's what I thought. I didn't think we had one out there because the other jobs I've had showed me the panic buttons during orientation. My manager said he wasn't even sure where it was... It's surprising because they call our city Little Detroit because the drugs and crime. 




 Thank God it was my favorite manager there. Had it been the other two, I definitely would have at least gotten written up. They couldn't fire me because we're union! 




 That's what I thought! By the time they got there, I had completely forgot about the box! Yeah, my manager mentioned that it's a good thing that we knew it malfunctioned now. Apparently, it's been there since the place opened and was really outdated! 




 That would be absolutely terrifying! Thank God there were no guns out because it was clear once they got there that everything was fine!  




 I work in a growing grocery store that has a gas station attached to it. I was recently asked to work the fuel section while one of the girls went on vacation. I knew nothing about the panic button. Chaos ensued.

I was sitting in my room, and I notice this white box thing with a hole and something that looks like a suction cup in it. Ive never been told about it and never noticed it. I get busy and forget about the box. We die when my co-worker comes in to sit with me. I notice the box again and start looking around it, but there is nothing on this box.

So, me being me, I start playing around with to figure it out. I was messing with the black thingie and accidentally pushed it in some. When nothing happened, I figured it was some old, disconnected button for the pumps or something. About 25 minutes later, I see 4 cop cars fly into the parking lot.

One comes up to my window and asks if Im ok. I give him a confused look and tell him that Im fine and ask why. He told me the emergency button went off, so I asked where it was, and he told me around the register. Then it hit me what I had been playing with. I ask him how to turn it off, and he says to call the manager.

The manager comes out and asked what happened. We both tell him that were not sure. Then he pops the button out and says it should be off. About 10 minutes later, corporate calls to tell us the panic alarm is on, and to let the manager know. So we call him again, and he says hell be out there.

By this time, I tell Matt that I need to go pee. I go explain to the manager what had happened and explained that I just didnt want to say it in front of my co-worker. I didnt get in trouble because I told him before he went to watch the cameras, and he understood my embarrassment. He then walks out there while on the phone with support. It turns out the box had actually malfunctioned and couldnt be turned off. They suspended it and let the cops know. Tomorrow, maintenance is coming to fix the box... 




 My life has been quite hectic recently. I apologize if this is all over the place. My mind has been quite *different*. I can't explain what is happening, but I'm hoping you can. I'll start from the beginning.
I work at a growing chain of grocery stores that have gas stations attached. I'm normally just a stocker, but my department is also responsible for helping run fuel center. Since the main girl out there went on vacation, I was scheduled to close up by myself. We close at 11 every night. Never early. I expected it to be a great week. After 8, the fuel center dies, and we are allowed to play on our phones and entertain ourselves. I decided to bring my DS and play Pokemon to pass the time. I was quite excited to get so lucky.


Man, was I wrong.


My first evening was going fine, until my co-worker left, leaving me alone. The first hour flew by in a flurry of winning battles and catching Pokemon. Soon, it started. I could hear a woman almost  shrieking, so I looked out my windows to see no one at the pumps. I then look at my camera monitor, but it's blurry. I've never seen it blurry, but I put it off as a glitch. I stepped out to see if maybe I was hearing the song from our speakers outside, but there was nothing. I blew it off as my imagination and continued with my night. Soon, I heard what sounded like someone trying to get into my small office, so I look at my monitor again, and it's acting really strange. It will go blurry, glitch, and then go clear. In the moments of clarity, I can see there is no one out there even though I can hear the banging and knob rattling. I call my boyfriend, and he calms me down. Soon, I have to go out to lock down the machines and other merchandise outside, so I get off the phone and hurry about my business outside. I figured since I had been outside for about 20 minutes and nothing happened that I had imagined everything. So, I close the inside and lock up. On my way to drop off the key to the main store, I can hear a whistling, but there is no one around and the radio had been turned off. I dreaded coming back.


The next day I figured that since I worked with someone my whole shift, and it was during the day, that I would be fine since I had worked it a thousand times during the day. Everything is fine, until my co-worker goes on break. The camera started acting strange again, but there were no weird sounds, so I wasn't too worried. I got up to grab a water out of the back fridge, but as I stood, my radio changed stations without anyone touching it. I walked back to it, and it changed back to my original station. I was freaked out, so I just turned the radio off all together and sat in silence. The rest of the shift was fine.


Then, today was the most intense yet. I came into work already terrified of what awaited me, but I wasn't working alone until the end of my shift. Since things only seem to happen when I'm alone, I figured that I would be ok. Once again, nothing happens even an hour after he leaves, so I think that I'm just going crazy from the social isolation and being alone out in a room by myself. That's when I could hear the shrieking again, but no customers seemed bothered. I put it off as my imagination running wild. It was probably about 10 when I could hear something pounding at my door. I even heard the door open and papers fluttering. I got the courage to look in the back section, and nothing was out of place. I sat with only my phone playing music and looking around at the outside to watch for anything out of the ordinary. When it was time to close up the outside area, I kept getting the uneasy feeling of being watched, and I would catch glimpses of what looked like something in my room. That wasn't possible though. It was locked and I had the only key to it around my neck. I thought that it was only my reflection and hurried to get back to my safe haven. I closed down the inside and started my walk to the store. I got the feeling again that I was being watched, so I turned my head. I wish I hadn't I saw her "standing" in the shadows by the recycling dumpsters. I use quotes because I couldn't see legs on her, just the head and torso. She would have been about 5 foot tall. She had wild black hair with what looked like could have been red highlights, her dress looked like a sack and was dirty and ripped, and her eyes, oh her eyes. They were the only facial characteristic I could see. They were almost black holes. I kept my eyes on her as I rushed back into the store. I dropped the key off and rushed to my car. When I got to my car, I could smell what I assumed to be her. It was a mixture of rotting flesh and old urine. I got in my car and pulled out in a frenzy. I kept looking in my rearview mirror because I thought I saw movement in the backseat, yet there was nothing. No one could be back there because there were two boxes that take up all the room. I get to my parking lot, and I smell the same smell as I'm walking through the alley to my apartment. I then hear steps behind me, so I look... There is nothing again. I bust threw the door of my apartment and explain what had happened that night to my boyfriend. I went to open the bedroom door, but before I got it open, I heard the springs of our bed move as if someone jumped out of bed quickly. I think she followed me. I keep seeing movement by my window. I feel strange. Maybe I'll underssssstand. Maybe I could knnnnnow. Please, help me.

EDIT:

More has happened, last night my window air conditioner turned itself off and on over and over. Then, we woke up this morning to find that my hamster had disappeared. We have 2 hounds, and they would let us know if the hamster was inside the house. There is no way it got out of its cage, and there is no blood or bite marks by the cage. Finally, my job requires a box cutter, and we always put it out of the reach of the animals. We found it across the room behind my tv. Also, when I tried to resubmit this, Reddit had an "emergency maintenance". Just a coincidence?
