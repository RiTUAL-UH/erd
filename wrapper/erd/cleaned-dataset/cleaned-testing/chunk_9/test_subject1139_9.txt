 $250,000 covers a budget of one episode. Maybe two for a really cheap series which Death Parade isn't, judging from its quality.

NTV who owns Madhouse also owns Hulu Japan, so at least Death Parade functions as an original content to their catalog. Original content is becoming more important since Netflix is launching in Japan this fall. So it's not a total loss, but I wouldn't get my hopes up for a 2nd season. Although it would be a very pleasing surprise if it happens.  




 I don't use it because of the ghosting. The smoothness is cool for a 1-3 minute scene but I wouldn't be able to stand watching a whole series with ghosting.

Also there's not a lot of actual 60 fps content other than sports broadcast and some porn. The Hobbit trilogy was shot at 48 fps. Most movies and TV shows are 24 fps. A traditional animation TV show is basically 12 fps upscaled to 24 fps with repeated frames.
 









 That was an exciting episode of mostly just action scenes. Being able to convey sense of speed and the frenzy of combat was always this show's signature. I also like how the action can seamlessly transition from a wide shot of the battle to an up-close and personal view of it. There might be better choreographed action scenes out there but in terms of the full package that gets the heart racing this show's action might be the best of all the recent anime.

Some nitpicks: there were a few spots when it got choppy, some in slowmo and others during a few camera moves. There were a couple of Transformer-esque angles and super quick cuts that made things momentarily hard to follow.

 I try to keep up with indie anime short films. There's some odd and experimental stuff that are a nice change of pace from the usual.

Most recent one is [The Lost Breakfast](https://youtu.be/rtcH5k2-fLM).

Some are just a simple animation/artistic showcase like [in the Wind](https://youtu.be/GZ39V34qInQ).
 




 This short was made in Japan, by a Japanese director/animator, it's based on a [rakugo tale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakugo) and won an award at Hiroshima International Animation Festival. It's as Japanese an animation can be. 














 All these wishes, witches and memories are all getting mixed up in my head. Well, it's really not complicated if you reread and think about it but it disrupts the page-turner feel of the manga. It's not bad, just different flow to the story.

 I love how Rokumon just casually stole stuff...well it's more like getting back what Rinne was owed. 




 If you're looking for a more active discussion try the show's MAL page forum. Nothing huge, about 30-40 replies per episode. 




 The recent fat shaming uproar made Hijikata's "pig gag" even funnier.

Gin complaining about the women-turned-men being OP was the funniest part.

Yes! MADAO finally made an appearance...sort of.

 Hak going into rage mode was intense.

[This page](http://www.titaniascans.com/reader/Akatsuki+no+Yona/091%3A+He+Was+a+Very+Precious+Friend/#page=25) really expressed the mixture of anger and sadness. The way Yona calmed him down was moving. The last few pages of that chapter were a fantastic mixture of emotions.

I thought we might see Zeno's ability in this arc. A bit disappointed that wasn't the case.
 




 A cut, in visual mediums, is the abrupt transition from one scene to another. 

A cut is a transition from one shot to another. A scene is made up of shots sequenced together with multiple cuts. Although there are scenes that are just one continuous shot (oner/long take). 




 [He's a count/bishop that got assassinated by a disembodied arm](http://i.imgur.com/fNtMruG.jpg). Bodin blamed the Parsians and wanted 10,000 sacrificed as revenge.

I also quite liked this [exchange between Guiscard and Bodin](http://i.imgur.com/Dn3S3id.jpg), which wasn't in this episode due to the changes. 




 The guy worked his ass off to get to the pinnacle of his profession, he should be damn proud of that. He shouldn't have to act humble on account of some idiot's fuck up. 




 I guess the Pedelaus incident got skipped. It's what caused Bodin to asked for 10,000 Parsians to sacrifice.

Is the rest going to be anime original? The sequence of events in this episode is drastically different from the LN/manga.
  














 The smoke and fog effects looked great. The fogginess really made the battle atmospheric. I wish the explosions were of the same quality, just like the one in the Blame! clip.

Did not expect Benisuzume to make an appearance, and it's a 2.0 version. So Gaunas are also attracted to Higgs particles. Time to switch to an alternative fuel source!

 I wouldn't say he got shoved but he was going hard to the basket and a slight push while in the air would be enough to get him off balance. But since the Cavs lost the popular narrative is LeBron flopped into the camera.

 I love how Kyubei goes into an honest introspection of her gender conflict only to end with this [punchline](http://i.imgur.com/r7zc8fl.png). 




 While Ribbon-girl could have approached this trumpet solo drama in a more tactful manner, I liked that she questioned authority and was openly confrontational instead of rumor mongering behind Reina's and Taki-sensei's backs. No half measures, no wishy-washy shenanigans, just straight-up going for the truth. 




 I couldn't get into Expelled from Paradise. Too much storytelling through exposition instead of through character experiences, sequence of events and observable world building. I got nothing against exposition but the movie needed a better balance between telling and showing. 









 So, does Kevin Love get the [Yamcha pose?](http://i.imgur.com/CRbY6M4.jpg) 




 The Hawks and Bulls weren't as bad as people made them out to be. This Cavs defense is legit. 




 I thought the Kashan Castle chapter would be two episodes, still not bad. The anime has pretty much caught up to the translated LN chapters.

I hope the next update to the LN translation would be a big one.

I'm guessing the first two episodes are anime original written by Junichi Sato and Reiko Yoshida. I'm hoping they have more written material waiting to be made into an anime series if this three episode OAV becomes a big hit.

 The production committee determines the budget of the show. Sure, sometimes the studio is part of the committee and invest money into the project but they sure as hell don't finance the whole thing. 




 A majority of action scenes in Sidonia are animated at 24 fps. That's twice the framerate of traditional anime. 




 Isn't this what /r/animegifs is for?

 God damn. Hak showing up at the end got me hyped.

It was also nice seeing Yona recover from being overwhelmed by the situation. 




 This show continues to have unusually high amount of shots of feet. A lot of times they're used as another way to express emotion and personality, and sometimes for more practical reasons. I'm half expecting someone to do a video essay on it, just like [Tony Zhou did one on chairs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfGKNJ4mldE) 




 There's actually been a character like that, Nanamine Tooru from Bakuman. 














 Could still be manga territory if they're using unpublished rough drafts.  














 Yuhata is back in the harem game. I'm fine with the harem hijinks as breather episodes and this episode was amusing but three in a row is pushing it. I want to get back to the scheming, action and tension.

Izana's new abilities to control a Garde looks promising. It seems like there's going to be a conflict between Yure and the Captain. 

Maybe it's just me but the animation and overall presentation looked so much better in this episode. Especially the lighting; [construction site](http://imgur.com/a/jPe36#2), [sunset](http://imgur.com/a/5gYxC#0), [morning light](http://imgur.com/a/l4K1u#0) and [Thousand Year Village](http://i.imgur.com/K9mZHBP.jpg).

 It's still not true 60 fps interpolated since the 24 fps source has repeated frames due to the anime being animated in 2s. Repeated frames can't be interpolated since there's no motion going on. 




 I think for a lot of these shows the studio is really just a hired contractor. The sales are financially inconsequential to the studio and the ones that either profit or lose money from sales is the production committee that hired the studio and financed the whole project. Obviously the studio wants the show to sell well since it could make them look good and help them land more and better projects but as long as they keep getting new projects then I don't think sales are a be all and end all. That's why Deen, Satelight and Pierrot are still in business.

Also it's not all about disc sales. Some shows are made as promotional material for manga, LN, video games, merchandise and as part of a multimedia project. Additionally, ratings matter a bit more for non-late-night shows. Some of these reasons are also why recent late-night anime like Garo and Rage of Bahamut are getting 2nd seasons despite not selling well. 




 Children and daytime shows are also more stable income since they tend to be 2 cours or long running. I'd bet most studios would love to land a long running show.

 [The Ballad of Suicide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBZyTX22THA) 




 He got a triple double but he gotta tease us with an almost 30-20. 









 The number of shows indicates an increased interest in investing in anime. These shows are funded by manga, LN and video game publishers, toy/merchandise companies, TV Networks, marketing/advertising firms and other investors with varying interests. There's more to anime now than disc sales, merchandise sales and boosting manga sales. Using anime to promote LNs and video games is now common practice. We are seeing more multimedia projects that include anime. Then there's the relatively new found wealth known as streaming. Like I said, anime is the most ubiquitous as it has ever been with it being streamed on netflix, hulu, funimation, crunchyroll and other smaller streaming sites. Of course I also said this boom is not sustainable.

Regarding anime... remember how a cour used to be 13 episodes, and most shows were 2 cours? I think it's telling studios can't really afford buying airtime anymore. And the money certainly isn't going to employees.

Two cour late night shows are risky. Production committees have just gotten smarter. If the first cour is a success then they'll make another one. There's still bunch of two cour shows, most of them are daytime because TV networks don't want to reload their time slot every three months. Also studios don't usually pay for the airtime, the investors in the production committee do. Studios for the most part are hired contractors. The exception to that being when a studio wants to make an original anime or invest their own money in exchange for a larger slice of the pie.

 




 [Manga](/s "Kotori Moegi's mini-arc was great, so was Konno's. I think those two were only bested by Noa's. Also, Aiko Chikushi was hilarious") 




 The anime was doing a good job of condensing the material early on but it's starting to feel rushed now. It was unavoidable, 90 chapters in one cour is tough to adapt no matter how good the writing staff is. Then again, as a manga reader my perspective is probably skewed, it seems like most anime only watchers are fine with the pacing.

[For Otsuka fans](https://streamable.com/ll8u) 




 Well, he was disappointingly unspecific but then again his doom and gloom assessments has always been like that. Anime is in a boom right now, producing 30-40 shows a season and the most ubiquitous as it has ever been. Saying that's unsustainable is pointing out the obvious and can be said about any industry going through a boom period.

It might have been worthwhile if he pointed out the declining relevance of physical media which will eventually affect the industry and the possibility of a demand for higher wage which will raise production costs.

However, Mr. Anno does not think that this will mean an end to anime as an artistic form of film. He points out the possibility of the centres of anime production moving to other areas of Asia with good conditions.

Certain parts of anime production are already being outsourced to other Asian studios because it's cheaper. Being payed worse than an already underpaid Japanese animator isn't exactly good working condition. I doubt it'll change so drastically in five years that the industry would move outside of Japan. 




 That moment must have been cathartic for Dwight Howard haters. 




 Shirou is a walking and talking meatbag of idiocy with his extremely simple minded and comical sense of heroism. I root for his death with every episode. I should stop watching FSN.

 It's more like his harem is reloading. Hoshijiro is out and got replaced by Tsumugi. Yuhata has kind of fallen out of the harem and Samari is picking up the slack. 




 [Looked like he was chugging some sake.](http://i.imgur.com/GmRiquJ.png) 




 After an extended break, harem hijinks are in full swing for a second episode in a row.

It's not all feel good stuff though, the Captain is really going all in with her arms race against the Gaunas and the colonists are more screwed than I thought. 

[Izana's suit malfunction](https://streamable.com/448z) 




 lol true but when he has to deal with someone as illogically stubborn as Shirou it's hard to blame him for taking the asshole route to get his point across. Although in the end it was all for naught. 




 We saw Saber get owned by a mere human with some magical enhancements, this story has some wacky power scale logic. So I kind of expected the Shirou nonsense. 




 To be fair the Avalon plot armor was built in from the very beginning, so it wasn't a total ass-pull...but yeah still plot armor.

 Nothing fancy, the Garo video is just the 24 fps source converted to 60 fps motion interpolated. Here's the avisynth script that I used:

     Cores=4
     SetMemoryMax(512)
     SetMTMode(3,Cores)
     PluginPath = "C:\Program Files (x86)\MeGUI\tools\avisynth_plugin\"
     LoadPlugin(PluginPath+"svpflow1.dll")
     LoadPlugin(PluginPath+"svpflow2.dll")
     Import(PluginPath+"InterFrame2.avsi")
     input.ConvertToYV12()
     SetMTMode(2)
     deinterlace
     crop
     denoise
     resize
     InterFrame(Cores=Cores)

 [The actress that played her in the live action is also cute.](http://i.imgur.com/E7r0a9Z.jpg) 









 Well, this really isn't true 60 fps motion interpolated since the repeated frames from the 24 fps source were included. I believe this is true for most 60 fps converted anime videos with the exception of CG scenes animated at 24 fps.

I did experiment with getting rid most of the repeated frames and just using the animated frames by cutting the fps to 12. Then motion interpolating up to 60 fps but it looked bad. So much ghosting, even just going from 12 to 24 looked bad. The posted video still have ghosting but nowhere near as bad.

Did another one:

 Oh man, they took out the part during the invasion where Gieve went to a temple to whoop some Lusitanian ass in order to get more loot. Also, I'm pretty sure the Lusitanian King wasn't fat in the light novel. The light novel also took more effort to characterize him as a religious fanatic which even made his desire to marry Tahamine even more surprising.

 Also that Gauna emitter looks means in the preview, not quite sure what it provides Sidonia when they already have missiles that can blow up planets, but I guess they are kind limited?

The Anti-Planet Missiles can be dodged or intercepted that's why in the last season they had to use the Gardes to get rid of the Gauna first in order to let the missile destroy the dwarf planet. 




 Show by Rock! 




 In terms of manpower, time and effort there's a huge difference between 3-5 minute CG scenes per episode and doing an entire series in CG. That's why only the action scenes in Sidonia are fluidly animated.
