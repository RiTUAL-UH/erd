 Could you imagine the type of stuff we could write without creative limitations? God, we could have so much fun.  




 I'm in support of a broader allowance for the believability rule. Hell I wish we could do away with it altogether.   




 Can't believe I'm just reading this one now. Holy shit.

 Dude.  




 That was a really good video.  




 They were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should. 




 Tom was my best friend when I was a kid. Wed bonded over a deep obsession of Jurassic Park and our subsequent passion for Paleontology. 

We used to spend every weekend out in the woods excavating the forest floor for dinosaur bones.

But one day our parents wouldnt let us go. We heard the adults whisper about another body being found "after all these years. The whispers scared us and we agreed to play in the backyard instead.

That was the day we finally hit pay dirt. After a year and a half of looking we had finally found our first section of dinosaur skeleton  and in my backyard no less!  We hurried inside to tell our parents but only my father was home. He was excited and agreed to take us to the university the next afternoon to present our findings.

But we never went because Tom never made it home from school the next day. I was devastated and when we moved out of state several months later I forgot entirely about the dinosaur bones in the back yard. 

Until today.

This morning my daughter came home from a weekend with grandma and grandpa. She said she hadnt been allowed to go outside because of some missing kids in the area. And for the first time since I was nine I thought about the bones Tom and I found. And I wondered
 




 I think Rich did find Track B.  




 In two miles take exit 19 for Valley Park Drive South. Siri chirped from my sisters phone. 

Charlotte, turn that off. I know where Im going.

You sure about that? I meanit *has* been a couple decades, Mark.

Please, like I could ever forget where Adventure Valley is. Come on, we spent every summer of-

There it is! I swerved briefly into the oncoming lane as Charlotte thrust her arm in front of my face to point excitedly out the window. Theres Adventure Valley! Oh my God, what ride is that? That coaster, it was called Steel something, right? No, no, wait, thats Mayhem Mountain, isnt it?

I gently pushed my sisters arm out of my face and back over to her seat. I couldnt fault her for her excitement while I was trying so hard to control my own giddiness. It felt like we were kids again, yelling and bouncing in the back seat of my parents car as the first shining rails and wooden planks of the parks roller coasters came into view above the treetops.  

Thats the Steel Viper. I told her. Mayhem Mountains on the other end of the park. And that wooden coaster over there is the Excalibur.

Oh yeah! I remember those! I was always too much of a wus to ride the viper but I rode the shit out of the Excalibur.

Well, Charlotte, youre an adult, now. I think its time to take on the Viper. 

As long as the contractors have tested it and given it the okay, Im in.

That was really the question, wasnt it? We didnt know which rides had been inspected and cleared and which ones hadnt. I sent up a silent prayer that Mayhem Mountain was counted among the rides that had. Id left Brandon several voicemails asking about it since he was the one in charge of everything. But with how fast things had been moving since wed bought the park, I couldn't fault him for being a busy man.

If you'd told 12 year old me that my crazy, hyper, wild-eyed friend Brandon Decker would end up graduating cum laude from Northwestern business school I would have laughed in your face. Brandon? No way. Tyler, maybe, but never Brandon. In fact, half the reason I think he choose a business designation was *because* of Adventure Valley. When the park had closed in 1989 Brandon had gathered us all together in his basement and, with a gravitas and solemnness Ive never seen in him before or since, asked us to make the pact.

At the time the promise had been the most serious vow that five 12 year olds could ever make. High off of an entire summer of Adventure Valley fun, we agreed, with all the ceremony of a meeting of parliament, that we would one day come together and buy Adventure Valley Amusement Park.

Of course, back then wed planned to just buy it and ride the roller coasters into the ground. We decided which friends from school we would let in and which enemies would be barred from the gates. It had always been *our* park, and it was only right that we should have it.

It had taken twenty years but we eventually did fulfill our promise. With a hell of a lot of pushing from Brandon (and a sizeable offer of collateral from Tyler) the bank had agreed to give us the multi million dollar loan to buy, repair, refurbish and reopen the park. The size of the loan that the six of us were responsible for gave me nightmares for several weeks. How would this place ever turn a profit? It had been closed decades ago after operating in the red for several years. The county had experienced a high number of runaways and missing persons in the area in the last years of the 1980s. The entire region was on edge as the cases mounted and people in the area became depressed and suspicious of each other. It had absolutely killed park attendance.

But seeing the first cresting waves of roller coasters rails through the trees made me all but forget about my financial worries. This was *Adventure Valley* for Christs sake. If we opened the gates, people would come.

There! There, there, there  thats our exit! Charlotte squeaked.

I pulled off the interstate and took a left under the bridge. Less than a mile later we came upon the acres of the parks parking lots to our right. We turned in and drove all the way up to the front near the gates where several other cars were parked  a Lexus, a Mini Cooper, an old Chevelle and a Honda Civic  another rental car like ours. 

Looks like were the last ones here, Charlotte said. 

She was right. As we pulled up next to the Lexus I noticed a group of people standing next to the ticket booth, waving to us excitedly. 

Oh my God, is that Tyler? Jesus, hes lost some weight, hes so skinny now! And Brandons losing his hair. Holy shit, is that Koji? Koji got hot!

Calm down, Paris Hilton, these guys are my friends. Theyre off limits to you, same rules as when we were teenagers. Besides half of them are married.

Reallywhich half?

I raised an eyebrow at Charlotte and shook my head in amused bewilderment. My little sister never had outgrown her boy craziness.

Wait, whos that? Charlotte asked as we got out of the car.

What? Thats Scott! You know Scott.

Not Scott, Scott looks exactly the same. The girl *next* to Scott.

Oh. I had put this off so long that Id actually forgotten to tell my sister at all. Thats Dani, Scotts girlfriend.

Dani as in Danielle *Burcher*?

Wellyeah.

My sister gave me such a horrified look that youd think Id betrayed her to her death. But it was fleeting and quickly replaced by a sly smile.

Fine by me. Im sure shes not the same person she was in high school. Were all adults now, right? Now come on, lets go!

A sigh of relief escaped my chest as I slammed the car door and followed Charlotte over to the entrance. Though I saw most of these guys every year, seeing us all here together, standing at the ticket booths of Adventure Valley, brought me a sort of happiness I hadnt experienced in many years. 

Mark-fucking-Lantice. I cant believe it. Tyler had an edgy, commanding voice that probably made his many employees shudder and scatter. But I knew him like a brother so his bravado just made me laugh. 

Can you believe it? I asked as I gave him a hug and a slap on the back. Back at front gates. $15 a day doesnt seem so ridiculous now.

Pfft, $15 a day, my ass. Brandon said as he shook my hand. By my math, it looks like well be charging about $65 a day.

Ill pay it! Charlotte smiled as she gave Koji a hug.

Are people really going to pay $65 a day? Koji asked. Even Disneyland only charges $85 and there you get  access to two parks.

How could I forget, Brandon shook his head. One of our investors works for the mouse. Pity they wont let you design any artwork for this place.

Come on, man, Im not an artist, Im an engineer.

Dont you mean *imagineer?* Charlotte winked at him.

Koji sighed and shook his head. Yeah, I fuckin do. 

As Brandon and Charlotte teased Koji I made my way over to the side of the ticket booth where Scott and his girlfriend were conversing. I didnt know why Scott was being so standoffish but I thought it might have something to do with the investment. Scott, the least well off of us six, worked at his dads collision shop and hadnt had a whole lot of money to invest. I thought maybe he was embarrassed about the money but now, watching him lean against the booth with slowly shifting eyes, I realized it wasnt that at all - Scott was just stoned. Same old Scott.

Whats up, Burnout? My brother. I havent seen you in like 15 years, how about a bro hug?

Scott smiled and pushed off the wall to come give me a quick hug. Hey, hows it going, man? Fuck, look at you. What your diet, man, rabbit food and lettuce? Youre not gonna get any ladies with that skinny body.

Your mom doesnt seem to mind.

Hey, Mark. Im Dani. Do you remember me? Dani Burcher? Scotts girlfriend gave me a shy smile and stuck out her hand so we could engage in a stiff handshake. 

Yeah, I think so. You were in my sisters class, right? Charlotte Lantice?

Dani had the decency to look embarrassed. Yeah, but we werent really friends.

*Thats putting it lightly,* I thought.

We were freshmen when you guys were seniors. She added.

Yep, I do remember that.

Maybe I should just get it over with. I called Charlotte over and the re-introduction of the two girls, while awkward, was over pretty quickly to everyones relief. We were all eager to get into the park. It was odd not stopping at the window for tickets and even odder to walk *around* the rusting turn-styles of the front gates. I delighted in reminding myself that we owned this place now.

Brandon gave us a tour of the park. Now so much of the geography  we all knew that inside and out  but of the hypothetical layout and reorganization of the park as he saw it. 

The Excalibur is going to need the most amount of work, according to Rich. (Brandons head contractor). A roller coaster made of wood exposed to the elements for all these yearswell keep as much of the original structure as is safe but we might have to rebuild most of it.

Do we have the money for that? Scott asked loudly from where he walked behind us with Dani.

Yeah, Tyler said. We have the money for that.

Ah, Mr. Moneybags. That Mini dealership treating you good? I nudged him hard with my shoulder. Tyler stumbled but kept enough composure to push me back into a passing churro stall.

Those *six* BMW dealerships are treating me very well.

Well enough to serve as the sizable collateral we needed. Brandon added.

So, Charlotte ran up behind us and threw her arms around Tyler and Koji. Can weride some rides?

Are you kidding? Why do you think were here! Tyler laughed.

Im just here for Mayhem Mountain. I said clapping my hands and rubbing them together eagerly.

Brandon threw up his hands. Alright, fine! I thought you guys would be interested in how your investment is coming along.

Koji snorted. All were interested in is the projected ROI and, more importantly, which rides have passed safety inspection!

Oh, Brandon stopped walking and tried to look annoyed, and, failing that, he smiled. A little over half of them are rideable.

Suddenly everybody was talking at once.

Is Steel Viper open?

Yep, that ones on. 

What about Snapdragon?

That one is good to go, too.

Renegade Falls? 

The waters not on.

High Roller?

Yes.

Space Spin?

Oh yeah.

Power Tower?

Theyre doing the inspection this week.

There was only one ride I really cared about  mine and Brandons favorite. 

What about Mayhem Mountain?

Fuck. Yes. He answered to collective groans from the rest. 

Mayhem Mountain had always been our thing. The others had always been happy to ride High Roller and Snapdragon into exhaustion, Brandon and I always split off toward the end of the day to ride Mayhem Mountain into the twilight hours. 

Ugh, Charlotte shuddered. I hate that ride.

Its boring as hell, Koji agreed. I helped design something similar for Disneyland Hong Kong. We put it in *Fantasy Land*, for fucks sake.

Hey, that ride is awesome. Its long and it goes upside down, I argued. Charlotte is even too scared to ride it!

Im not *scared* of that ride, it just gives me the creeps. Something about it, just, I dont know, seems off.

Alright, look. Well start at this end of the park and work our way towards the back. That way we can ride every ride thats passed inspection - including Mayhem Mountain. Brandon said.

And Snapdragon, Tyler added and the others nodded excitedly.

Yes, *every* ride. And of course we can ride them, you know, as many times as we want. 

Hell yes, brother. Koji high-fived Brandon and we headed down the street toward Space Spin.

Our progress through the park was blissfully slow.  Everyone wanted to ride every ride multiple times and one person always had to stay in the loading area to operate the ride.

It only took an hour or two to forget that I was a fully grown 35 year old man. Being back here, running through the line-ways with my friends, arguing who got the first row of the first car, it was like being 12 years old again.

Still, my eye was constantly drawn up over the buildings into the distance, to the back of the park where the high, gleaming rails of Mayhem Mountain shined in the unobscured sun. There would be no arguing who got front row on that coaster - it was me and Brandon. It was *always* me and Brandon.

Charlotte, Tyler and Koji were the most like children, constantly running ahead and arguing over which ride to get on next, yelling back to ask Brandon if this one or that one had been cleared by the contractors. 

Brandon and I held back from the group a bit, discussing ideas and possible improvements for the park. Scott and Dani took up the rear of the group, quietly talking and lighting joints. 

When we arrived at the Enterprise, a simple ride that consisted on spinning cars on a circular track, I offered to flip the switch while the rest of the group rode to excess. The Enterprise always made me sick when we were kids. Brandon offered to stay on the platform with me to chat while everyone else rode the ride. 

I flipped the switch to turn the ride on and as the cars spun away from the loading area, the Enterprises signage came into view. I sighed. All day I had been trying to ignore the bright graffiti sprayed all over the park but the words painted over the signage for the Enterprise were impossible to ignore.

*Where did the missing kids go?*

And the rest of the graffiti in the park was much the same. Most said things like: Where are they?, Runaway Row, Find Ryan Kinskey, and The Missing are now Dead. Similar sayings could be found in town sprayed across a few dilapidated buildings in the industrial district.  

Brandons eyes avoided the sign but I could tell he was thinking about it, too. 

Do you think the reason they shut this park down, I mean, do you see that being an issue for park attendance? I asked as casually as I could.

Brandon was quiet for a few moments as he waited for the ride to slow to a stop so he could flip the switch again. 

Nah, I dont think so. Low attendance issues arent actually what shut the park down.

They arent? This surprised me.

Nope. When we were negotiating the sale of the park, I was given access to the parks financials in the 80s.

So they werent operating at a loss?

Oh they were. But this park has operated in the red since opening day in the 70s. Half of their revenue was being fed back into something called county services, whatever that is. The bank couldnt tell me and believe me, I tried to find out.

County services I mused.

Yep. Bizarre. And according to the paperwork the park was closed because the owner didnt want to live here anymore. And he couldnt be bothered to wait for a decent offer on the property so he just sold it to the bank for next to nothing.

So he was a rich guy. I leaned back against the railing to stretch my back. And an idiot.

Yes  to an extreme in both cases. The owner of the park was Abel Bissette.

Abel Bisette? Related to that French billionaire, Im guessing?

Brandon nodded. Michael Bisette. He built this park for his son in the 70s. Abel was never really what we would call business inclined. Ive always heard him described as simple.

I cant believe the son of a billionaire lives in this area.

Well, not anymore. He moved on decades ago.

I shook my head in disbelief. Who would ever have thought that our simple little park was owned by a famous billionaires son? Hell, I may have even sat next to him on rides and had no idea!

You guys want to go again? Brandon yelled to the others as the ride again came to a stop.

Im ready to move on, Koji yelled back. Anybody want to ride again?

Nope! a chorus of voices replied.

It was near 5 oclock when we finally arrived at Mayhem Mountain. As the sun began to set a familiar panic and urgency welled in the pit of my stomach. It took a moment for me to realize that we didnt have to leave when the park closed this time  because the park didnt close. We could stay until sun-up if we wanted to!

As I eagerly approached the turn-style for Mayhem Mountain Tyler spoke up behind me. Listen, can we run into town and grab something to eat before we ride Mayhem?

You really want to ride Mayhem *after* we eat? Asked Koji.

Good point.

Theres only *one* loop, Dani rolled her eyes.

Two, I said. Dont forget the inline roll.

Yep, two. Scott answered. Plus its a two minute ride. If your food isnt sitting well, youve got a long wait til its over.

Look, I said, Lets ride it a couple times and then go eat. When we come back well see how we feel.

Everyone nodded and we started walking through the line-ways up to the platform. When we reached the loading dock, I was excited to see our favorite green car sitting on the track.

Front seat! Brandon and I yelled simultaneously as the train cars came into view and everyone behind us groaned. 

Im staying here, Charlotte said. Ill just work the launchpad thingy.

Still scared after all these years, Char? Scott teased her. 

Shut up, Burnout.

Scott laughed and tousled her hair before running and jumping into the first car behind Brandon and I. Dani got in next to him and then Tyler and Koji took the second car. We pulled the shoulder restraints down and they locked in place.

Ready? Charlotte asked.

Yep! Brandon yelled back, Send the car through!

Charlotte pulled the lever and the brakes disengaged. As the car moved forward I turned to Brandon.

Did we get the green car on purpose? I yelled to him as the coaster clacked around the load platform and began the clattery climb up the first lift hill.

Yep! We sent cars through here all morning but I made sure Rich knew to leave the Green Machine in the loading bay.

Awesome.

As the train climbed up the lift hill I made no attempt to hide my utter glee. I looked out over the expansive park and couldnt believe it was mine. Every track, every car, every turn-style, every *screw*, from the front gate to the overflow parking lot in the back, it was all ours. How I wished I could go back in time and tell a young me waiting in the two hour line for Mayhem Mountain  one day, you will OWN this place. 

And as we crested the hill and the train fell into the first drop, I realized I essentially *had* gone back in time. At least, I was screaming like a 12 year old, as was everyone else behind me. 

We dipped into the first tester hill and then banked hard and up, to the second lift hill. We dropped from there, down into the vertical loop, banked around a set of gift ships, up briefly and then down a small hill into the inline roll. When we arrived back at the loading bay we were all screaming and whooping. Charlotte didnt even have to ask, just smiled at us and sent us through again. 

We went twice more before we finally got off the ride. Koji walked over to check out the control panel while the rest of us taunted my sister. 

You sure you dont want to go, Char? Its awesome.

Nah, Im good. I have no problem being the carny for this ride. She laughed.

Come on, Charlotte, just one time. One time and well leave you alone. Tyler urged.

No, no, no, no, no. No way. Not interested. Ill ride anything else, though!

Hey, do you guys know what Track B is? Koji asked.

Track B? What do you mean? Brandon walked over to Koji at the control board and raised an eyebrow. Thats weird.

Its probably just the track they use to get the cars into the storage bay, Scott said with a shrug.  

No, Koji said. Thats called a transfer track. Track B has to be something else.

Yeah, well Ive been on this ride enough times to know that there is no other track.

Yep, Tyler agreed with me. He has. 

Soshould we try it? Brandon tested. 

Fuck no. Said Charlotte. If you dont know what Track B is that means the contractors dont know about it either. Which means it hasnt been inspected in at least 20 years. Thats suicide.

Look, Koji said, if Track B exists than even the most incompetent of engineers would have found it during an inspection.

And Rich cleared this entire ride, Brandon nodded. Its probably just the ride in reverse. Were good.

Well, were in, announced Scott from the other side of the track, though Dani didnt look quite on board with the idea. 

Mark? Tyler asked.

Yeah, I guess Im in. What the worst that could happen: we get funneled into a repair bay?

Alright, then Im in too. Tyler said hesitantly. 

Koji shrugged. Here goes nothing. 

He flipped the switch over to Track B and a moment later a loud metallic scraping some distance away filled the park. The sound lasted almost a minute.  I studied the familiar silver roller coaster under the pink sky of the setting sun but I saw no physical changes to the track. I looked over at Brandon and a shrug of his shoulders told me he didnt either.

Shall we? Scott asked gesturing to the train cars wed just disembarked. I gave Charlotte a questioning look but she shook her head emphatically no. So it was just the six of us again.

Its only right you two take the bow of the ship. Tyler gave a mock salute. Oh Captains, my captains.

I laughed and hopped into the right side of the front row. Brandon crawled into the seat next to me. Tyler and Koji got in behind us and Scott and Dani took the back. We pulled the shoulder bars down and they locked into place. 

Are you sure about this? Charlotte asked when everyone was settled.

Dani said something from her place a few rows back but all I heard was Brandon yelling Pull it!

The brakes released and the train rolled away from the platform and into the twilight of dusk. The lights had lit up on the track while wed been arguing and the roller coaster looked absolutely beautiful. I was filled with awe and reverence at what this place truly meant to mean and my friends. It was a symbol of our youth and innocence and blissful ignorance of the world. It was our own little bubble of happiness.

The coaster again climbed the lift hill and from the top Brandon and I studied the track but in those few seconds I saw no difference. Brandon looked over and I shook my head at him disappointedly.  By the time we reached the vertical loop halfway through the ride it was clear that there was no Track B. But it was hard to be upset because I was still on Mayhem Mountain and still found it an impossible challenge not to smile.

We banked around the now brightly lit gift shops, up the small tester hill and then back down to the inline roll. Exceptthe inline roll was suddenly above us. Wed missed it. Instead the track now descended into a large, square hole in the ground behind the gift shops  and we were headed directly into it.

I was in too much shock to scream or even move. The black hole swallowed us in an instant and we descended into complete darkness. I felt a comfortable pressure leave my shoulders and realized that the shoulder bars had released. I gripped the front lip of the ledge of my seat and heard the terrified screams of my friends behind me as the coaster suddenly spun into what felt like an inline roll. I was too scared to do anything but hold on for dear life though some part of my brain registered that the g-forces of the roll probably would have been enough to keep me in my seat if I had let go. Probably. 

We came out of the inline roll and dropped again - hard. As the roller coaster dropped the room suddenly lit up around us and I saw the track below arcing up into a light tester hill. As we hit the bottom of the hill the shoulder bars lowered mechanically. The car went over the small tester hill and then braked to start up another tall lift hill. I took my first breath since dropping through the ground and looked around, tuning out the screams of Dani and Tyler behind me. 

We were in what can be described as a cavernous room and I only assume it stretched to the farthest reaches of the park above. There were lots of vertical loops, high drops and sharp curves that put the track perpendicular to the ground. Throughout the entire sublevel building lamps dotted the wall every 30 feet. They put out a dreary, yellowed glow for as far as the eye could see. But many were burnt out and in parts the track disappeared into darkness.

But in the dull, yellow edges of the light I saw something that registered in me a horror beyond death. Far away from us, in a section of shadowy track, I saw the high crest of a peak hill which reached almost the ceiling of the giant room. And then the track justended. 

Suddenly feel the horrible reality of the world outside my mind began to bleed in. Dani was screaming uncontrollably, Tyler was crying, bawling even, Koji was yelling at Brandon who was looking straight at me, hitting my leg hard and repeating my name. As the cars continued to climb I finally gave him my attention. I didnt want to be alone in the fear anymore.

What is this? was all I could think of to say.

We have to get off this ride. We have to get off this ride, Mark.

I fucking know, man.

Were going to die.

I fucking know, man! I yelled as we reached the top of the lift hill and dropped over the other side. I squeezed my eyes shut until I felt the shoulder bars once again release and I bit my lip to keep from crying. I opened my eyes and choked as I watched the track ahead up us bend up into a vertical loop. I reached up and tried to pull the shoulder bar down but it was locked in place.

Hang on! Hang onto the seats! I yelled as loud as I could.

As we approached the loop I felt the brakes engaging, slowing the car, and a tow cable catch beneath my feet. We were being pulled up through the loop, but too slowly for gravity to keep us in our seats. 

As the train began to invert I felt my feet rise from the floor of the car. My hair fell over my face and my butt left the seat. I closed my eyes and tried to block out the screams of terror from behind me. I concentrated on my death grip of the ledge of my seat as we rounded the track. We remained upside down for what felt like eternity. Finally the pressure began to ease, my butt dropped to my seat and my feet to the floor. The white noise subsided from my ears and I heard Kojis screaming.

Tyler! Fuck, fuck, he fell out. Fuck, he fell, hes dead, man, hes dead.

He hit the track down there. Brandon yelled at me, wide-eyed and crazy looking. I was finally seeing the Brandon from my youth. The shoulder bars descended again, this time locking in tighter.

We came out of loop and sped up and down several tester hills. I tried to study the track ahead of us as we went through the safer parts. I thought I saw water reflecting off the metal rails somewhere in the distance. Brandon sobbed in his seat. 

Mark, what are we gonna do? I dont wanna die, man. I dont wanna fucking die.

I dont know. I dont know what to do. Im sorry, Im fucking scared, too. I answered him. 

We banked around a corner of the room and the shoulder bars released again. This time we dove into a curve that put the left side of the train parallel to the ground  and it was a long drop. I gripped the edge of the seat tightly as before but this time I kept my eyes open and was able to catch Brandon as he began to slip out of his seat. 

By the time the train righted itself, I couldnt tell whod been lost. Most of the screaming behind me had turned to loud sobbing or silence. The shoulder bar didnt reengage and I felt the cars brakes slow the train down again. I didnt have to loop to know what was coming next. 

It was another inverted loop - this one was tall and large and I could tell wed be upside down for longer. Someone behind me began screaming again, Dani I think, as I tried to take measured breaths and position my hurting hands back under the lip of the seat. Brandon did the same and looked over at me as the car started up the loop with tears streaming down his face. 

I dont wanna die in here, man.

I shook my head back at him because I could think of nothing to say. 

I felt tears leave my own eyes as we reached the tipping point of the loop and my feet again left the floor. Before we were even completely upside down I felt my back begin to slip down the seat. I thought if I lost my grip, I could try to grab for the shoulder bars when I fell out of the car. 

The car suddenly stopped and I opened my eyes to see we were completely inverted. I grunted loudly at the pain and immense effort it was taking to keep my grip on the seat. The car started to move again slowly and I heard Brandon say something to me. I looked over at him just before he slid out of the car. One second he was there, next to me, and the next he was falling, falling away from the car.

I saw Brandon try to grab the shoulder bar on the way out but we couldnt keep his grip on it. I watched him fall and I saw him break his back on the track below and he stopped moving. I stared down at him as the car continued to move slowly around the loop and he stared back up at me, dead, or dying. By the time the car hit him on the way out of the loop, he was completely gone.

The shoulder bars re-engaged and we went through a dreadfully long period where nothing happened. We were secured in our seats by the restraints as the coaster spent what felt like several minutes racing over hills, banks, curves, even an inline roll. 

Without the adrenaline pumping through my veins, I felt the shock begin to wear off. It was replaced by a panic and fear unlike Id ever experienced. And I decided that was the point of this section of track: to build and facilitate an unbearable fear. 

I felt the brakes engage finally and I looked ahead to find the loop we were surely entering but there was none. We were high, almost to the top of the ceiling and we slowed to a stop on a straightaway. Directly ahead was a drop and at the bottom of the hill, a series of four different tracks, with a transfer stack just before they split off. Each track had five or so feet of color  red, orange, green and blue  before racing off in different directions. 

I felt an urgent shaking of my shoulder and turned around to hear what Koji was saying.

Which track are we connected to? 

I looked at the transfer stack.

Green.

Where does green go? It was hard to hear him over the sound of Danis sobbing from the second car. I tried to trace the green track through the building, constantly losing it and finding it again. I wasnt sure, but it seemed to end at the lift hill Id seen earlier. The hill with no track at the top.

It ends at that hill, I yelled back at him and pointed. Dani cried louder. 

Fuck.

While we were stopped I rubbed my hurting hands together. As I looked down at them I noticed something new in the car. At some point a small, blinking panel had flipped over in the wall at the front of the car. It had four colored buttons and an old analog timer. The timer was so old and damaged that though the numbers were clearly changing I couldnt see how long we had. 

We get to choose, I said and explained what I was looking at.

Can you see which track ends where? Koji asked.

I followed all the track as best I could but the rails circled and slid in between each other. It was hard to tell which track went where.

I think the blue track ends in that big pool in the corner. The red track ends in a wall and the orange one just drops into a hole in the floor like the one we came down here through. I think.

Theres no way out, dude, said Scott from the second car. His voice was unsettlingly calm. Theyre just telling us how were going to die.

We can still find a way out of this. I answered quietly, more to myself than to him.

Choose the pool, Scott said, and I could hear the tears in his voice. Ive heard drowning isnt an awful death. Ive heard its calming at the end.

No! Choose the hole in the floor, said Koji. Its possible it drops down into another cavern like this. There might be more track which means more time to figure out how to live.

You dont think wed be the first to choose that option, do you? Scott asked him. And no one that went missing ever came back. Theres just more death in that hole.

I dont want to die like this, Koji begged. And at least its a chance.

Dani was still whimpering in the back and offered no suggestion. It seemed the decision was up to me and I had to make it fast. 

I knew I didnt want to die by dropping off the track. I didnt want to drown. Perhaps the quickest death was the wall. More than likely we would all be killed instantly. Less suffering, less time to think about our fates. But the truth was, I wasnt enough entirely positive which track ended where. It was all educated guesswork and my time was up. 

The orange. Lets go down to the second floor, if there is one.

Scott and Dani said nothing and Koji choked out the last words Id ever hear him say. 

Push it before it chooses for us.

Before I could think about it any longer I pushed the orange button and committed us to whatever death it led to. We heard the metallic scraping of the track transferring below. Once the orange track was securely connected, the brakes on the car released and the train rolled slowly toward the drop. Dani started screaming again. 

As we dropped down the hill I got a better view of the orange track. There was a vertical loop ahead that didnt look as high as the others wed been through. If fact, it looked like there was a chance the fall wouldnt kill us. *If* it wasnt an optical illusion and *if* the shoulder bars disengaged for that loop we might have a shot at living through this. I yelled back to everyone behind me.

Let yourself fall out of the loop, the one up there!

No one responded to me, which didnt matter because I didnt think Id have the courage to let go of the seat anyway.

We raced along the track in and out of banks and curves. And one point we passed along the pool and I looked down. Below the waters surface the track ended above an even deeper pool. I could see the shadows of several coaster cars at the very bottom. 

I suddenly felt the brakes engage and I realized we were coming to the loop. I tested the shoulder bar by pushing up on it but it stayed locked. I was somewhat relieved in that moment to know I wouldnt have to make the decision to fall out now or gamble on the orange track.  But suddenly  the restraints released.

As we started up the loop I gripped the lip of the seat tightly and turned my head back to look down. It looked like we were very high and I only hoped the ground was the loosely packed dirt that it looked like. I had to choose now  the fall or the hole. I choose the fall. 

As I began to slide up the seat I yelled at the others to let go and fall out of the car. And then I closed my eyes  and let go. I felt my head crack the shoulder bar on the way out. 

It wasnt like a slow motion fall - it was over before I realized that Id actually let go. One moment I felt an intense pain as my head hit the bar and in the same moment I realized I was on the ground. I hadnt even had the time to realize the possibility of hitting the track below or get run over by the cars. I opened my eyes in time to watch the cars speed over the track above me. 

The pain didnt hit me all at once. I had one long, blissful second before I felt it. And then I was in agony.

Id hoped my body was so in shock that I wouldnt feel much of the pain but I felt it all. I concentrated on keeping my eyes open and trying to catalog the damage. There was blood on my clothes but I didnt know what part of my body it was coming from. I heard screaming as well but I didnt know if it was in my head or coming from my friends as they approached the end. 

I didnt want to move, didnt think it was safe to move, but I knew I had to, if only to pull out my phone. With trembling fingers I pulled the thing from my pocket and brought it to my face, trying to focus on the screen. But it was shattered and refused to even turn on. I threw it away from me and then I realized the silence.

Their ride had ended. 

With a great amount of effort I rolled over onto my stomach and dragged my broken body across the ground toward where I thought I remembered seeing the hole. I crawled for what seemed like hours and maybe it was. Sometimes I tried to stand or even kneel but the pain in my back and ribs was too great. I passed out several times from shock and pain but eventually I made it to where the track disappeared into the ground. I pulled myself to the edge and looked down inside the hole. 

The track ended just below the surface. 

It was a natural shaft with walls made of rock. I didnt know how deep it went and I didnt want to. It was a fate Id only narrowly escaped. But then I thought my friends were down there and maybe someone survived. 

Koji? My voice echoed loudly down the shaft. No answer. 

Scott? Nothing. 

I reached for a nearby screw and dropped it down the hole. It took half a minute to land and when it did it was with a *tink* as it hit something metal. The small sound echoed up the shaft and out into the cavernous room and I realized this place was built with acoustics in mind. I rolled over onto my back and studied everything I could see from where I was, staving off my bodies desire to pass out again. I felt nothing but numbness when I finally saw what I was looking for - a long, panoramic window in the far wall. I knew what Track B was for and I finally let myself slip away into the darkness.

I remember very little of my rescue. There were lots of people in uniform and my sister yelling and pain - lots of pain. I was in and out on the way to the hospital but I remember I passed through the room behind the window at some point. And from my stretcher, through the chaos, I saw in that room a single chair facing the window. It was covered in a deep layer of dust. 

I was never visited by anyone official, let alone asked to give a statement. Charlotte stayed by my side at the hospital for months while I recovered. She wouldnt say much about that day although she finally did tell me something. She that that they wouldnt let her ride with me to the hospital and that someone offered her a ride. On that drive shed been spoken to by two people that had convinced her to never speak of what had happened and to convince me of the same. Whatever they threatened her with had her begging me to agree. And I did  at the time.

I am still to this day learning to walk without aid. I never saw Mayhem Mountain again. The loan defaulted and Adventure Valley was bought up by an unknown LLC which bulldozed it and built a block of apartments over the top. Theyre still empty to this day.

I dont like the dark anymore. It reminds me of the horror my friends experienced as they looked down and saw the track end before they disappeared into that hole. I try not to think of what they must have felt as they fell down the shaft in complete darkness, strapped to a roller coaster, waiting for the terrible end. I wish Id chosen the pool, if only to save them from that fate.

As for the billionaires son, he was only simple in the fact that he was a man of simple tastes. And he still is.

I looked him up once, only a few years ago. He owns several amusement parks now, all sizable but small enough to be popular only in their specific regions. In fact, one is not very far from where I live now. 

Ive thought about going many times, just to check, just to see. But then I realized that I probably didnt need to search all the rides in the park to know. 

Because I know that somewhere in that park, some ride in some cornerhas a Track B.

 I use different accounts, only a couple. 




 How did you know? Clever boy. 




 See and people have been telling me there were no rooms 733/734 and I distinctly remember them.  




 I'm in!  




 It's May 20th all over again.  




 About a day  




 I am. I will PM you!  




 Here! I'm here. You are free to use that story!  




 If you want to just wait for May 1, that's fine with me.  




 Thanks! 




 I thought it was too long for Nosleep, honestly.  




 Have met a Gennipher.  




 Oh man.  




 Try and see this as blue black and then go back to the original image. http://i.imgur.com/1N29HcQ.jpg 




 I only saw gold/white and thought everyone was trolling me. I came back to the image 15 minutes later and it had switched to blue/black. It's bizarre. 




 http://i.imgur.com/1N29HcQ.jpg 




 Look at this image: http://i.imgur.com/1N29HcQ.jpg 




 I saw it as white/gold only until someone posted this picture: http://i.imgur.com/1N29HcQ.jpg

Now the original image has switched to black/blue. 




 I only saw the white gold until someone posted this picture: http://i.imgur.com/1N29HcQ.jpg

I stared at it so long that the original picture has switched to black/blue and not I can't figure out how I saw gold/white. 




 The bottom picture you linked is the first time I've been able to see the black and blue so THANK YOU.  




 I agree. I cannot figure out how to see blue and black. Especially the lace trim, like how is anyone getting black. So I asked my kid and she saw blue and black and I know she's not trolling me.

Such an interesting phenomenon.  




 I try so hard and for the life of me I cannot see the black. It looks gold and darker gold.  




 I'm on board with you lovely people!

 Oh man, the McStays. That recent development broke my heart when it came out. I thought for sure they were in Mexico.

 I'll jump on the Spire Bandwagon; I can't ever pass by an opportunity to talk it up. It's just one of those things you have to read. It's brilliant.  




 I like the way you think, sir.  




 No, you're good. If you're asking which came first, it was undoubtedly the script of this movie. Regardless, both stories borrowed the concept from Flatliners.  




 I'll admit I was unpleasantly surprised when I saw the trailer for this but honestly, as you said, so far the only similarity I can see is using a serum to bring someone back from the dead. 
 




 Gun Dog!!!! No! you were too young...too beautiful... 




 Write that scene with great economy. Just imply it.  




 This is one of the greatest things I've ever seen on Reddit.  




 Happy cake day! 




  Not that I've ever pissed myself in public.....just saying.

 "How is it you can't remember, David?" 

"Because nothing happened."

"Someone died that day, didn't they?"

"I've already told you, there was no murder. No one died."

The one named Shaw braced his arms on the table in front of me and hung his head between his shoulders, mumbling to himself in obvious frustration.

"Alright," said the other one, called McNulty, from a darkened corner of the small room."Why don't you tell us what you do remember?"

"Am I being arrested?" 

"No, you're being questioned." From McNulty.

"I've been here for 7 hours now, I want to go home."

"You can't go home, Mr. Lancer."

"Then I want my lawyer. Have you called the number I gave you? Christian Bennett's office."

"We can't reach him."

"Give me my phone and I will call him."

"We don't have your phone." 

"I want to see my wife then."

The one named Shaw slammed his fist into the table and then dragged his chair to the other corner of the room. He dropped down into it and kicked his legs up to rest his ankles on the doorknob and then pulled out a pack of smokes. "You know that's not an option, David."

"Why is it not an option?"

"Do you really not remember?" From McNulty. 

"I've told you, I don't know what you're talking about. What I do remember is you guys showing up to arrest me out of the blue."

"You aren't under arrest, David." Shaw said through the cigarette between his lips.

"Tell me about the party." From McNulty. 

"What party?"

"The one we've been talking about all night, Mr. Lancer." 

"I don't know what else you want to hear. Jen and I showed up on time at the restaurant, we met my son's fiance's parents, we celebrated Andrew's engagement for a few hours, we went home."

"Someone died."

"No one died! We ate, we drank, we paid the bill and Jen and I left!"

"How much was the bill?" Asked McNulty.

"I don't remember. A little over $11,000."

"That's an awful lot of money for a dinner." From Shaw.

"It was my son's engagement party."

"Your daughter-in-law's parents didn't chip in then?"

"No. My wife and I are well off and they are not. We offered to pay."

"And your son didn't contribute either?"

"Why would they? Andrew and his girlfriend have only just graduated from college. They don't have a lot of money."

"Has your son seemed interested in your finances lately?" From Shaw.

"No! What has my son got to do with this?"

"Why don't you tell me what happened after that." From McNulty.

"We went home and we went to bed."

"Tell us about the murder, David." From Shaw.

"I don't know how many other ways to tell you people this - THERE WAS NO MURDER."

"Mr. Lancer," McNulty stepped from his dark corner  but didn't unfold his arms. He seemed to regard me with distant amusement while Shaw stared intently through rings of smoke. If this was a game of Good Cop/Bad Cop, it was obvious who was who. "Did you see your son again that night?"

"No, I did not." I said through clenched teeth. "Why are you suddenly bringing up Andrew?"

"Are you sure?" From Shaw.

"Yes, I'm sure I did not see him again that night. Did something happen to my son? Is that what you've been trying to say to me? Is Andrew-"

"Your son is perfectly fine, Mr. Lancer. Perfectly alive, anyway." From McNulty.

"What is that supposed to mean?"

"Are you sure you don't remember seeing your son again that night?"

"I did not see Andrew again that night!" But then, right at that moment, it became untrue. Andrew's face appeared in my mind's eye, and from a scene I couldn't remember happening. He had emerged from the dark, pale and frightened, holding something that wasn't quite in the frame.

"Do you recall the murder, David?"

And then sound bled into the scene, too. A ragged breath from him, like tearing paper. A surprised utterance of his name from me. A burdened grunt, an unexpected crack in the darkness, and footsteps running up the stairs. And then I remembered it all suddenly falling away from me.

"Do you remember who died that night?" McNulty asked leaning against the wall next to the window. He was looking out of it into the darkness, into a world that I had failed to notice in my long hours there, or, perhaps, had tried not to. A world made only of sharp, gray angles and raw, white corners, a world without colors or curves. 

"Yes, I think I do remember." I said, staring out the same window, waiting for a sun that should have risen hours ago.  "It was me."






 




 



 




 Yes.  




 As soon as the door to the cabin closed behind us, I ripped off my mud caked jacket and threw it at Ben. 

"What the fuck are we doing?!"

"They were there. They were out there."

"There is no 'they', Ben. There's only Ash."

"No, Ash is dead; he was probably dead within minutes of walking out of this cabin."

"Then where's his body, Ben? Why was his grave empty?"

I knew I was starting to snap. The shock, the absurdity of it allmy brain couldnt compartmentalize it anymore.

"I don't know. It was the first grave; it was made to- made to draw us out there."

"By Ash. Theres no other logical-

"No," Ben shook his head, "Mel was right, Ash wouldn't do that."

"Well he did do that."

"You're wrong."

"Because there's no other alternative-"

"Those things we're seeing aren't Ash!"

"-and I refuse to believe that stick figure people-"

" You have to accept the fact-"

"-are running around the woods killing our friends-"

"-that we're being hunted out here-"

"- and field-stripping their dead bodies!"

"-by something fucked up and inhuman!

"-when it's clearly Ashley suffering from some sort of PTSD!"

"It's not Ash, Ingrid.

"He murdered Lloyd!"

"Listen to me-

"Ashley fucking murdered Lloyd!"

No-

Theres no-

"I DID IT! Okay? I killed Lloyd!"

I shook my head, disoriented and took a step backward.

"It was me, Ingrid! I killed Lloyd."

"Why are you saying that..." I choked.

"Because it's true. Out by the jeep-"

"Stop."

"And I'm pretty sure that Lloyd ki-"

"Stop!"

"Ingrid, you have to listen to me if you want to survive. Those things, they have this power - when they're near you - to make you so angry. Fuck, I mean, fuck, I just, I couldnt stop beating Lloyd's head in with a-"

"STOP!" I gasped, trying desperately to draw air into my lungs. I clutched the back of the couch for support. I could feel a blind, foreign rage building in me and I turned my knuckles white trying to quell it.

"Are you on Ash's side? I whispered, finally. Did he tell you to hurt Lloyd?" 

No, I just...I just killed him."

"And who peeled the flesh from his bones and buried him in the ground then, Benjamin?" I said and was unsettled by the flat, impassive tone of my voice.

"They did."

"Why would they do that?"

Ben nodded to Lloyd's computer, which was sitting open on the coffee table where he'd left after he went to bed at the end of his watch. 

"Read what Lloyd has been writing, Ingrid."

Keeping a wary eye on Ben I rounded the couch and picked up the computer, waking up the monitor with a swipe of my finger.

There were only 15 pages - which didn't seem like much for the days he'd spent locked away writing - and while it started out like any other story, the text quickly descended into nonsense and random strings of alphanumeric until the last three pages on which he'd simply typed *It Eats Us* over and over again. 

I slammed the laptop shut and threw it on the loveseat. Then I walked over to fridge, pulled out the last beer in it - one of Ben's- and dropped down into the nearest chair. 

Ben hadn't moved. 

"I'm so sorry, Ingrid. I'm so sorry. I loved Lloyd like a brother and I just snapped. I was just holding the crowbar and thinking about-"

"Stop talking, Ben."

He stopped but choked on a pent-up sob. Ben was right. Mel was right. It wasn't Ash, it couldnt be. It was something else all along, something that lived out in the wood.

"Ingrid, I have to-"

"Ben, the only reason you're telling me this is because they want you to, I'd guess. I don't have a reason to hate you and so they're allowing you to give me one."

*CREAK*

Ben and I looked at each other and then at the door to the basement. It was coming up the stairs.

I knew it was over, we were totally fucked. There was nothing left to do but die. I raised my beer to Ben, gave him a solemn nod, took a long gulp and then hurled the bottle at the basement door where is shattered into tiny pieces.

"Fuck you." 

"Ingrid," Ben brought my attention back to him and he looked at me pleadingly, through the veil of a thousand different emotions. "Run."

Before I could respond, Ben dove for the basement door and threw himself down the stairs. I shot up out of the chair in horror as his body made the most tortured and sickening screams I had ever heard. 

I stood there for long seconds listening to his flesh ripping apart to the soundtrack of a low, satisfied growl. 

I was frozen. I was alone. And as I looked desperately around the room for something to fight it with, I found the thing that I couldn't see before, the thing that had bothered me about the room since Moss disappeared. 

And it wasn't unexpected or unsettling; it was just...out of place.

There had appeared sometime overnight a long, very thin black line that ran vertically against the wall from floor to almost ceiling. It was hard to see and at first glance it appeared to be a crack in the wood but when I really looked at it, it somehow wasn't actually on the wall at all. 

And then, as I was studying it, it moved and expanded to become the tall, black stick man from Ash's drawing. No, it hadn't expanded...it had turned toward me. And the thing was as thin as a piece of construction paper.

I can tell you that when you're presented with something so impossible and something so innately wrong, you don't scream. You don't gasp. You just stand there frozen with confusion and, in my case, crippling fear.

It took another creak from the basement stairs to snap me out of my catatonia. The creature that had been quietly standing in front of me suddenly sprang to life and ran at me with all the fluidity of an animated drawing. 

Since it was between me and front door I turned and fled out onto the deck through the sliding glass door which Mel had left blessedly open. I ran to the end of the patio, and without taking half a second to think, climbed over the wooden railing and jumped off.

I heard the bones break underneath me when I landed but adrenaline kept the pain from crippling me entirely. I ran as best I could across the clearing toward the treeline. The fog thinned suddenly in the direction I was running and I saw the third stick man waiting for me in the trees.

I quickly tried to change course and fell on my broken ankles. When I looked up to see if it was coming toward me, I saw that it wasn't actually a stick man at all, it was something almost worse. It was Melanie.

She was hanging by the neck from a tree branch, facing the cabin and, consequently, me. I was on my feet and running toward her in under a second. When I got to her I could tell immediately that I was far too late and too short to reach the branch she was hanging from. All I could do was watch her dead body swing in the wind and cry. The rope she hung from looked like it couldnt hold her wait, but it did. Where did she even get it? 

I looked back at the house then, to see if the stick men were close, but it wasn't them that I noticed. It was what Melanie had seen out at the graves, the thing that made her run.

Ash was on the roof, lying there, splayed out for us all to see. His head was untouched and his face held a look of intense pain and horror. His hands and shoes were pristine, too. But the rest of his body; from his neck, to his wrists, to his ankles were picked clean of flesh. He was simply a brittle skeleton with a face. 

So, they had done this. They had done this to Ash and they were doing the same to Mel, giving her the tools she needed to die. And soon she would look just like Ash did. I couldnt bear the thought.

I tried everything I could think of to get her down from the tree until the physical pain ebbed in and, just as it did, I saw the shape of a stick man walking toward me through the fog. I told Melanie I was sorry and then I ran, falling only once as I sprinted away from the horrors of the mountain. 

The Stick Man never caught me because it didn't want to. After hours of walking, when I thought the agony of my broken bones and soul was going to kill me, I could still see them in the wood. And Ash was right, there were three. They would appear as a silhouette and then disappear as they turned to walk and reappear...well, anywhere. But they would always end up closer to me than they were before. 

And then, long after night had fallen, I tripped on a dirt road and didn't get back up. I stared up at an empty, starless sky and waited for a passerby or a Stick Man to claim me. It ended up being the former. 

No one ever believed me about the Stick Men. 

They told me all of our phones were found in our rooms. They said there was nothing wrong with the cars. That may be true now, but it wasn't then. I know they'll never believe me about what really happened out in the woods, but I'll always know. The Stick Men stripped our souls away. And then the Stick Men ate what was left.  




 Yeah somewhere on the 5th floor. One of the dorms is super haunted they say and yeah, I think it might have been Morton.  




 Howdy, author of posted story here. I also lived in Reilly but I think on the 5th floor if I remember right. I based everything in the story around NAU but, as you can tell, took a lot of liberties. For those interested, there was a suicide room on our floor that was turned into a broom closest. Not sure if true or urban legend though. 




 Yeah, Reddit did that. It's universal from what I hear.
