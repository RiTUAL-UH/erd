 Awesome, thanks so much Deimorz!  We appreciate your work. 




 Just keep adding Atlas 5's, problem solved! 




 Any idea how long it took to slow Cassini down enough to be captured? 




 We put things in the orbit of Mars, so that's possible.  

Jupiter is so massive that they probably have to make sure to avoid probes getting dragged into it's orbit.  

I believe there is a probe hanging around Saturn.

Uranus and Neptune were fly-bys?  (I'm asking, I can't recall.) 

I wonder how far off from possible an orbital probe out there is.  

I suspect the real reason is money, there just isn't much that having something in orbit of Pluto would accomplish vs a fly-by and the cost is probably a lot higher. 




 Is it even reasonable to put something in to orbit around Pluto, or is it just to small to get a probe out there in a reasonable time, and stop it?

 The concern that started the whole thing is with a surfactant called SLS, sodium lauryl sulfate, which is in a lot of things.  It's a strong surfactant, and some people are sensitive to it, although most people don't notice.   It will "dry out" your skin, which in this instance is a touch misleading becuase it's not removing water, it's removing the stearic acid (which is similar to wax) from your skin.  Without the oily layer in your skin, moisture escapes, and your skin gets flaky. 

In order for SLS to do this, it has to get into your skin, the micelle formed by SLS is quite smaller, and it can slip into the pores, for some people this is worse than others.

Another surfactant, SLES, sodium laureth sulfate, is similar in structure, but it has a few ethylene oxide units between the carbon chain and the sulfate group.  It turns out this is hugely important to the irritation profile.  Those groups make the micelle of the SLES much bigger, and they don't enter the skin nearly as much, hence they are far less irritating.  Now, SLES doesn't foam as well, adn people like foam, even though it has nothing to do with cleaning.  So to increase foam in SLES shampoos, some companies add SLS or Cocoamidylpropyl betaine, which is a foaming agent (it's glorified coconut oil, all of these things are.)

As it turns out, the SLES and betaine conbine to make the shampoo even less irritating, depending on the "sulfate-free" shampoo, it may be significantly less irritating that the sulfate-free (this is the case if the shampoo uses an alpha-olefin sulfonate surfactant.)

So there is not problem with SLES, but it's a "sulfate" so now people think it's terrible...even though they don't know why. It's fine, unless you're a statistically trivial group that has unusual sensitivity, then you should not care.

 I was wondering that, I suspect there is a reason they can't, Deimorz is pretty sharp, I would be surprised if he didn't think of that.

Also:  Can we expect to see you around a bit more? We saw you were added as a mod to /r/defaultmods... 




 It's the suppression of freedom that adds the zest! 




 Things have improved because /u/Deimorz and /u/krispykrackers are now tasked with listening to us and making things happen. Deimorz is explaining to moderators what is technically possible, and what is not.  He's going to work on making things happen, and I personally believe him.  (krispykrackers too.) Deimorz wrote Automoderator, he gets it.

Both are the most trusted admins left, and  if either of them get sacked for no reason, reddit will burn to the ground. 




 I think I may mention to Kn0thing that removing Deimorz would be a really bad idea...I think that might be taken seriously now! 




 That must have been done when subreddits were rolled out, right?

/u/spez has some 'splaining to do! 




 Please disclose where you work, your role there, the projects you have worked on, and a summary of your personal investments to continue this conversation. 




 Dude, shampoo is fascinating stuff when you get into the details.  Just look at the ingredients, I can tell you what each one does, how much they added (approximately) and how they added it, largely off the top of my head.  

Shampoo is also so much better than it was in the 70's, but ignore all the sulfate-free stuff, it's just marketing trying to sell you something.

Also, laundry detergent way more interesting than you are guessing, it's not just soap and water, there are about 50 different stains that are tested for and small changes can have huge effects on cleaning.  

 




  But your company was paid to conduct a study 

No, my company wasn't paid to do the study.  I'm an industrial chemist, I'm basically an on-staff expert, marketing wanted to look at it.  That's how business is done, sometimes things don't pan out.

Also, I no longer work for that company, and that company doesn't need protection anyway, it was Dow Chemical.

Now, I hope everyone of you will kindly disclose where you work, what you have worked on, and for good measure, a summary of your investments.  We all want to know what hypothetical conflicts of interest (as defined by people who have no idea what makes a conflict of interest) people have.  Just so we're on a level playing field.

If you're not willing to do this, I suggest we drop the matter.
 




 You clearly have no idea what a conflict of interest is. 




 He edited his comment, he said I profited **directly* from climate change, this isn't true, I have never received direct payment for anything climate change related.  




 Funny, because that's not what the GMO-Truthers say, fact is you don't know anything about my political beliefs, so please don't make definitive statements. 




 It's still ridiculous, you may one day in the future work on climate change related something, who knows!  Does the truck driver who delivers things to a plant that makes amines for carbon capture "work on climate change"  or does he just drive a damn truck?

I just did an assessment of the technological needs of the industry to determine if there was a market there, the conclusion was that there wasn't.  I actually worked on additives for diesel fuel twice as long, does this make me a shill for the petroleum lobby?  That's what so silly about the statement, editing it is kind of bullshit, because it was plain wrong, he should just admit that he was mistaken and move on. 




 Give us a "Promote to top post for 30 minutes" button so that we can give a special post visibility.  Not all content is the same, and the default frontpage structure makes defaults really dependent on the top post, if we have an mod message to the subreddit or a special event it would be nice for us to have  away for a large initial number of subscribers to see it, as it is now, we just have to pray it doesn't get buried for whatever reason. 

This would also let us counter downvote brigades you sit on the new list to kill posts. 




 Split out moderator permissions more specifically, this will help us run our big team of comment mods more effectively.

Specifically, I want Posts broken up into comments and submissions, and approve and remove.

We would like to give out permissions that allow simply for the removal of comments and nothing else.

 




 I post all of the AMAs by hand every damn morning because of this issue, it's pretty big to my quality of life I'd say!

For two days a week, Tuesday and Wednesday, we have dedicated accounts, and they will have enough karma that it isn't a problem, it's really the accounts we set up for people who are doing one-off AMAs that the issue pops up.

Could you make it that approved submitters don't get a captcha? 




 I was hired to work on something completely different, this was just something they tossed on me, that's how industry works, I don't generally choose what I work on, I'm ok with that. 




 We've kicked a similar idea around, but we can't get readers to read the sidebar, this would be lost on people.  AMA now means it's a q a, it's a generic term now. 




 Sure, I'm a researcher in industry, that's what we do.  You could make the same case (a better one actually), about laundry detergent.

So picking this out from the list of 100 things I've worked on over the years is misleading to the point of being a lie. 




 None of that, it was  a project to look at existing products for use in post-combustion carbon capture.  It was a "can we sell more of our stuff in this" thing.

I'm an R D scientist, it was the company's direction to look at it, and I do my job. 




 Your claims are stretched far beyond what any reasonable person would call "profiting" the projects I worked on were assessments of uses of our products, and we lost money by doing the work since it didn't go anywhere.  It was one of 5 projects I worked on at the time, I'm a scientist, it's what we do.

Maybe consider making logical arguments based on facts instead of libel and character assassination? 




 Not really true either, since it was an application of one of our products, I was paid for being an R D scientist and I did an assessment of the area, your argument is bullshit, give it up. 




 Yup, I don't expect there are any barriers to getting them to do AMAs! 




 [I posted a response to his claim, which is wrong.](https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/3bzhq2/rscience_shuts_down_after_reddit_fires_an_ama_mod/csv1vq2)
 




 This isn't remotely true, I've worked in home and personal care for the past 4 years, making additives for shampoos and laundry detergents.  I have worked on carbon-capture projects in the past, but they didn't go anywhere (which should shock exactly no one, right?) 




 I edited the text to include NGOs, I'm biased by being a chemist, and there aren't many NGOs that operate in chemistry, my apologizes!  I don't think we will have any issues with NGOs, so I haven't called it out as an area of emphasis. 




 It's small, but there are a several very experienced people there. 




 Yes, they are relevant, although, tanning it mostly a local event found in the skin, the hormone pathway is more related to base skin tones. 




 You can post this question in /r/skincarescience for more details, but tingling has nothing to do with the tanning process, and their mechanism is laughable because blood flow doesn't have anything to do with tanning, it's caused by a [specific biological process, called Melanogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte#Melanogenesis)

They are talking pseudoscience gibberish, it's typical of the marketing drivel.

 we can do this, good suggestion. 




 They do, and every one knows this, we have to get past it. 




 we have talked about alternative plans, it would take a long time to get back to where we are. 




 reddit was actually bigger than Digg at that point. 




 I am talking to them, and they are listening, I can't comment on follow through, but we have to give them a chance.  I do trust the people doing the work. 




 Because we can't do any of these things any where else, if reddit dies, so do all these plans. 




 We at least have the names of the people handling the AMA address.  Change takes time, I see no reason to pile on, our point has been made. 




 I am at a conference dinner at the moment, Alexis has been humble and receptive in our conversations.  I behave like a dick some times too, I can't hold that against him.

We want reddit to work, changes can't happen over night, we have to be reasonable. 




 Not hardly.  There was stern talking, but in the opposite direction from what you are speculating. 




 AMAs are more required to be scientists, less a peer-reviewed journal summary thing. 




 We will not be, we discussed it, and we do not see added value that would be worth the disruption to our readers.  We believe the admins are listening now, and we are willing to be patient. 




 We would like to talk about what our values are, what we are currently doing, and where we are going in the years to come, and why we support reddit.


**Our Core Values**

Our overarching goal is to bring science education to the public. We have set up outreach programs that help to get more people involved in science and to bring science to a level that can be understood and appreciated by people from every educational background.

To this end, we have invested enormous amounts of time working with scientists, working with science advocates, talking with public policy groups and so on; all with the intent of setting up a platform where people can come, discuss and learn about science. We are trying to break down the 'ivory towers' of science, so that those that are practicing science aren't living outside of the public. While this is no easy task, we are fortunate to be enabled by reddit as a platform. We are not here, spending this much time day-in and day-out just because we love science or because we care about reddit alone, but more because it is an incredibly powerful tool that we have that allows us to really make a difference. How often can you say that you are able to just go in and ask a question of Monsanto scientists? Or read about the newest, hottest research and see people from every walk of life discussing it, and explaining its scientific intricacies and real-world applications? Nowhere else on the internet offers that, and it's something we worked very hard to achieve - hence why we care so much and why we strongly support reddit.

*We believe in the scientific method.* As such, we support the peer-review process which provides the most basic test of validity through testing of ideas and speaking through data. We are not the arbiter of science, simply a venue for the presentation of peer-reviewed research.

*We believe in authenticity.* In this day of information availability, the truth always comes out, its best to speak honestly about what you know and make your case from that.

*We believe in civil discussion.*  The issues brought up by scientific findings arent always what people would like them to be, and controversial topics abound.  We believe that civil conversation is the best way to understand others point of view. One can disagree without being disagreeable, in the end we all agree far more than we disagree, and it isnt always a win-lose situation.

**How We Promote Outreach**

  *Links* 

We allow our users to post links to summaries of peer-reviewed scientific journal article from the last 6 months. Science journalists are professional communicators of scientific information, and they are able to put the research findings into context for the reader who would otherwise struggle to follow the jargon and other technical language found in the primary literature. Our users are then able to engage in conversations about the research findings in the comment section, asking questions and answering them so that we can all better understand the significance of the research (or insignificance as the case may be.)

*Science Discussions* 

Active posters in /r/science who have formal training or conduct research in some scientific disciplines have the opportunity to confirm their expertise with the forum moderators. We 'flair' these users so that you can identify (a) their academic degree and (b) their self-proclaimed research discipline and expertise. In exchange for acknowledging these users, we expect them to contribute constructively to the community.  We allow our flaired users to post their own summaries of a particular subject they believe to be worthy of discussion.  The flaired user/scientist can then directly interact with other users and answer questions they may have in order to put research into better context.  This is useful if a particular field of science is generating important findings, but they are not easily encapsulated by one particular publication.  This also allows for the non-scientist users to actually engage with a scientist working in that field, something they might never get the chance to do in their normal life.

*Ask Me Anything* 

AMAs are well known on reddit, but in /r/science we seek to bring scientists from many different fields who perhaps have no exposure to reddit. This gives our scientist users a chance to ask complicated technical questions of people who are making news in their field, and for non-scientist users to ask questions they have always wondered about, as well as reading about how scientists approach a problem and what science actually is (the continual testing of ideas.)


**Where We Are Going**

*Industrial Scientist AMAs*

Professional scientists typically work in three sectors:  Academia, Government, Non-profit organizations and Industry.  

We have had the good fortune to have access to many people from academia, non-profits and government labs, but the public discourse with industrial scientists has been virtually non-existent.  Many in society discount the views of industrial scientist because of the bias caused by having a financial stake in the research, and many in industry are concerned about public disclosures for legal reasons, be that the threat of being sued or being fired for saying the wrong thing.  Evidence can be presented for both of these sides, and that is why we find ourselves where we are now:  *a huge portion of the scientists in our society being closed out of conversations.*

We would like to change this, and bring more industrial AMAs, however it will take bravery and understanding on the part of everyone, but we think that the benefit of having an open discussion about the science of the products and services we interact with the most in life is worth it.  

You saw this beginning with our hosting of an [AMA with Fred Perlak from Monsanto]( https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3b6mr4/science_ama_series_im_fred_perlak_a_long_time/), who came answer your questions in as forthright manner as possible.  We know that a large number of people mistrust a Monsanto employee, and assign nefarious motivations to him.  We were pleased to read a civil discussion between concerned people, which did not concentrate on the bombastic extremes that are so often found in these interactions.

In the coming months we hope to bring you more scientists from companies that make the things you use, so that you, our readers, can better understand what it is they do and how they do science; we hope that people will reserve their judgment and listen.  Likewise, we hope that businesses will realize that cutting off communication with the public has not been good for our culture, and a different way forward is not to be feared due to hypothetical legal concerns.


*Current and Future Employment*

Many of our readers are students, and a big concern for students in science is finding their place in the world. For employers, having new graduates with the skills that are needed is critical. Properly identifying the current and future needs for skills in the sciences and related fields (like engineering and math) is important for everyone.  Having skilled people who cant find a job doesnt help anyone.  We will seek to bring AMAs and other related content to our readers, that way they can help figure out exactly what they should do.  Sometimes it helps to just ask someone!  While some students have the opportunity to ask people around them, and the large majority dont. (I know I didnt!)  We would like to do something about this.


**/r/science Supports reddit**

I mention all of these things because we can't do any of it without the platform that reddit provides.  This is a unique place that has allowed us to connect people interested in science, scientists and even random people who just show up. Without the reddit platform, it would not be possible to fulfill our goals of scientific outreach and we would not be able to communicate science to the broader internet community effectively. 

We welcome your civil input on this, and we are listening to you.
 




 Could I ask you to give the mods updates on a reasonable basis? 

While there may be a trust issue with others, I think all of us trust you. 




 We have a nature preserve right behind our house in Northern Illinois, we hear the coyotes every night, and I'm sure there is a lot back there.  What are the best ways to learn what's going on without causing disruption to the wildlife? I'm thinking web cams?  How do we place a camera where we can catch the action?  Maybe leave tacos out for the wild life? 




 There is no Santa Claus. 




 oh fun, this is why conference presentations aren't allowed, you can push whatever nonsense you'd like!

*Sets flair to "Epidemiologist"* 




 Does this mean you're an epidemiologist, or something slightly different? 




 I'm the mod in the green text, I've made a longer comment here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackout2015/comments/3c4x6h/leaked_conversation_from_kn0thing_and_the/csskpbs

But the short version is things seemed to have changed at least in the short term. 




 Too many hypotheticals, I work in concrete reality as much as possible, and the fact of the matter, as people are realizing, is there isn't a real alternative to reddit currently, making it a moot point.  

For me reddit is a means to an end, I'm  not doing this for personal glory, I'm motivated by science outreach, and dispelling myths about science.  

Every time I read something about antivaxxers or other clearly false things, it motivates me to do something about it, this is my doing something. 


As such, I need a wide audience of non-scientists to have a chance to read the content I arrange for, which means having non-science content intermixed, which is reddit.

See the issue?  
 




 Hey, I'm the mod in green here, I did the screen capture,of course, and shared it with some groups to explain the situation better.

This was the exchange that pretty much precipitated /r/science going private, as you can read, it's not about Victoria being fired, although we completely disagree with that action.

The issue here is one of communication and respect.  We don't treat our users like this when they message /r/science with questions, even when they start off by calling us traitors, or any of a lovely grab bag of insults.

When went public to break the stonewalling we were getting because we needed to finish setting up an important AMA and we had one day before the holiday to do so, time was critical.  We as mods really need to have prompt communication with the admins when we have issues, generally speaking we work independently and can handle almost everything, if it's gone past that, it's important.

As for the Science AMAs, I have always run them basically independently of the admins, I worked with Victoria to handle follow requests from our guests who wanted analytics on how many people viewed this AMA (totally reasonable requests.)  We don't have access to that information (I would love to have it!)

Given the frustration of the mods contacting the admins with questions, and our miserable success rate (it's not just science mods), I can't ethically refer our guests to an anonymous email address that I don't have any reason to believe will respond, and I don't have the bandwidth to put the requests in myself, so it puts me in a really bad position going forward, and that upset me.

As many of you noticed, /r/science was brought back public before any of the other defaults, this was because we had accomplished our goal of forcing a change in the communication behavior of the admins.  This being our only goal, we did not see a benefit to further disrupting the lives of our readers, a vast majority of whom do not care about reddit politics.

I take the admins at their word that they will be making an attempt to change (kn0thing seems to have come around as well), we have put a lot of work into making reddit a great source of science information, we want it to succeed.  


As for the Hawking AMA, I found the contact information independently, and arranged for the AMA to go forward.  It will be posted on Tuesday morning, we are quite excited.

Thanks,

Nate 




 Feel free to add me as a mod for biochemistry, I can tend it as part of the /r/science world

 We didn't take one then either. 




 This will be resolved by the morning, we are finishing up conversations. 




 As a mod of /r/science, and arguably one of the instigators of all of this, I'm ok with AskScience staying up, it's the tradition of AskScience not to get involved in the politics of reddit. 




 Yeah, this is just the last straw, honestly.  It's a series of broken promises and ignored requests that has lead up to this. 




 Good point, edited for clarity. 




 I'm willing to be patient, but it's gong to be really hard to keep AMAs  going in /r/science, I do most of the AMA set up by myself (sometimes while holding a sleeping baby) and I don't have the wiggle room to absorb this. I've been working to transition to a team but it just hasn't happened, because reddit... 




 I've spoken to her on the phone several times, in addition to working with her for quite sometime, I concour, if anything shady happened it would be totally out of character. 




 I have, but she's professional, so I don't have any more information. 




 I fully support this decision to shut down /r/IAmA, letting Victoria go is a slap.

To back this up, I am the mod in /r/science that organizes all of the science AMAs, and I am going to have meaningful problems in the /r/Science AMAs, Victoria was the only line of communication with the admins.  If someone wants to get analytics for an AMA the answer will be "Sorry, I can't help."  

Dropping this on all of us in the AMA sphere feels like an enormous slap to those of us who put in massive amounts of time to bring quality content to reddit. 

I personally feel like shutting /r/science down as well, that's how much of a bad taste this leaves.

 That is when /r/science started adding comment mods. 




 Your data is already out of date, /r/science now has ~~856~~ 857 mods.  :-D  

/r/science has more mods than the rest of the defaults combined (excluding AskScience). (Considering their are 50 defaults, that's quite the number.)

A vast majority are comment mods, but that's also a vast majority of the work, we don't need 800 people answering modmail! 




 In January 2014, /r/science started adding comment mods which should massively skew the data given the large percentage of the eventual total. 




 We are Legion.
