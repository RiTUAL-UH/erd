 From OP's article:

In 2014, some 370 cases of sexual assault on men or boys were reported across Sweden, according to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, although experts believe that the actual figure is much higher.

Lumping men and boys together does this topic a great disservice because pedophiles raping and molesting children is a very different thing an adult raping another adult.

"The general perception is that men cannot be raped," Lotti Helstrm, a senior physician at the hospital told Sveriges Radio, adding that male victims can suffer even more than women.
 
"In studies, the health effects are shown to be greater for men, both in terms of physical health and mental health. There is a greater risk of a raped man getting post-traumatic stress disorder," she said, adding that the subject of male rape remained "extremely taboo".
 
Helstrm explained that men were much more likely to be raped by other men than by women and said that the experience could lead to "sexual identity" problems in future.

So for everybody who's upvoting stories about women raping men, yeah, it happens, but most rapes of men (and women) are by men. 




 I just started doing Duolingo this week and this is such a good tip! Translating from other languages to English is just too easy. I'm going to do both courses concurrently, though so that they feed off each other. 




 Try /r/nutrition and/or /r/loseit. 




  but impossible when you have a partner who likes chips and candy a lot.

Then you need to have a talk with your partner. It took years for my friend to understand that if she wants her husband to lose weight she has to help him but not having junk food in the house, but eventually she got it. If you want to lose weight, your partner needs to be, well, a partner in it and support you.  




 Not sugar. As soon as you add sugar it's not a healthy food anymore. The problem though is that sugar tends to come in big bags so it's hard to say "only buy it when you need it." 




 A couple of thoughts: 

It could be that you're working so hard at listening that you're not really listening, if you get what I mean. Maybe if you relax a little and don't worry so much about whether you're looking her in the eye every minute and feel like you're participating in the conversation, you might be more likely to remember it.

Another possibility is that when you're talking, you thinking you're just talking, it's not like she's sharing anything specific that you need to know, even though she is. Maybe a good thing for you two to try is this 36-question test. They're meant to be personal questions where you open up about yourself. Maybe if you know specifically "this is what my GF is thinking and feeling," you'll be more likely to remember it. Quiz: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html?_r=0 




  Ask her every detail about what makes her feel this way

That's the most important thing. I'm guessing that GF thinks OP is not really listening and remembering the things she tells him about herself, but I could be mistaken. 




 Regarding the conversation thing, I get what she's saying. If you're just sitting there quietly, it makes her feel like you're not listening and/or like she's delivering a monologue, not having a dialogue. Even if you truly have nothing to contribute you can always make sure to make little comments to show that you're listening ("uh huh," "got it," "interesting," "I see," etc.) or if you make a little more effort, you can ask her follow-up questions on what she's saying.

As for the eating/ansomia, have you explained it to her the way you've explained it to us? If not, explain it again. If necessary, make a list of the places that you eat at and the foods that you eat and simply go to the next place/thing on the list whenever she asks you what or where you want to eat. Or roll a die (mentally) and pick the one that comes up. 

The dog that's not house-trained, that's disgusting, I don't know what to say about it. Talk to someone who knows about dogs.

Have you talked to her about her messiness? Was she single for a long time like yourself and got used to being a mess? If so, you need to talk to her about adjusting herself to the fact that now you're in her life and she almost literally needs to make room for you.

It could be that she is moving too fast, but remember you both are older. I'm sorry you felt you've missed out on things in life but if you've met someone you really like you'd be stupid to dump her in favor of going clubbing and sleeping around instead.

TLDR: You both need to make a little more effort to make this relationship work but if you really like each other it will (hopefully) be worth it.

 Yes and no.

The term "suffragette" was first used as a term of derision by the journalist Charles E. Hands in the London Daily Mail for activists in the movement for women's suffrage, in particular members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU).[7] But the objects of the intended ridicule gladly embraced the term saying "suffraGETtes" (hardening the g) implied not only that they wanted the vote, but that they intended to get it as well.[8]

 True, so when you consider Chareidi birthrates, it means that Yiddish is going strong. It doesn't matter if they're only one group of people. Native Hebrew speakers are also one group of people -- Israelis. Everybody else who knows it learns it in school and plenty of Jews don't speak it at all. 




 According to Wikipedia, one estimate puts Yiddish speakers at 2 million. That's nowhere close to being "nearly a dead language." 




  say, 1% per year

Just FYI, aside from last year(?) in the past 10+ years, the increase has never been less than 2% and it's been as high as 4.5%.

 /r/writing 




 If your book succeeds that's success for yourself. Wanting your book to succeed is not the same as wanting personal fame for yourself. Usually when an author is famous they're famous for something other than their writing. To take a nice case, John Green is known for his vlog. To take a not nice case, Bret Easton Ellis is known for being a jerk.  




 But if I was hoping to gain recognition from something

Obviously there are some authors who are fame-whores, but by and large people do not write books because they're hoping for recognition on a personal level.  




 I'm not sure such a thing is possible. Even WorldCat can't tell you what branch a book is in. But try asking in /r/libraries, maybe they'll have some ideas. 




 Going Postal.  




 I found the source of the pictures. So yeah, I see that's a breed and not a random mutation or anything, but apparently they are very expensive, so I'm still curious how it's worth it to kill them for their meat.

 They killed it. :(

I eat chicken, but come on, if an all-black chicken is rare, doesn't it make more sense to put it in a petting zoo so people can see it in real life? 




 Did you? This is literally the second paragraph. 

The rapid spread of Hasidism in the second half of the 18th century greatly troubled many traditional rabbis; many saw it as a potentially dangerous enemy. They thought that it was another manifestation of the recent messianic movement of Sabbatai Zevi (16261676) that had led many Jews away from mainstream Judaism. 




 The early Mitnagdim certainly thought so. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misnagdim 




 So many possible reasons. Here are the ones I thought of off the top of my head:

- Because if people are sitting and watching a movie for two hours, they're not shopping. 

- Because most people aren't at the airport for two hours.

- Because it's hard to concentrate on a movie with everything that's going on around you, and you should be alert in case your gate changes or something like that.

- Because too many people would forget to return the DVD's and accrue fines but get angry and blame Redbox, turning the whole thing into a PR nightmare. 




 Gotcha.  




 Thanks. 




 Thanks. 




 3:45AM

I see a bus leaving at 11:40 p.m.? The concert will probably be over by 10 and I don't plan on hanging around after. But after what everyone is saying, it definitely sounds safest to take a car to the station, thanks.

 Interesting question, good thing it's been asked here before.

 Pooping isn't just a way of getting rid of things we don't need, it's also a way of keeping your pipes clean. Dirty pipes tend to get corroded and eventually fall apart. 

So it's the opposite -- you want to consume more fiber to make sure that you poop. 




 When you're watching your weight, thinking any food is "the devil" tends to be counterproductive because it makes it even more tempting. 

But she is right that soda is bad for you just like any other high-sugar, low-nutrition food is. It not only contributes to weight gain but tooth decay when consumed excessively or as part of a general poor-quality diet. 




 A can of Coke is 140 calories. 




 Is downtown Philly near the Greyhound bus station (or the Amtrak train station) safe to walk around at night (around 10 p.m.) alone? 




 I don't know about this study in particular, but broadly-speaking, yes. The 1970s were the heydey of gender research; many study results were enshrined and have not been challenged or replicated since.  




 Because their main thing is their "tomatometer" and a movie has to score above a certain percentage to be called "fresh" or "rotten." Emphasizing the percentage emphasizes their gimmick. Otherwise it's just another metascore site. 




 No. I like variation in my life. If I wanted to look at myself all the time, I'd get a mirror.  




 That has little to do with it. There are areas in NYC that are becoming gentrified and it is pushing people out despite whatever rent control/stabilized apartments they may have for a number of reasons:

- It changes the character of the neighborhood. If enough of your neighbors are now white transplants from Oklahoma and not the folks you've lived with all your life, you're not going to feel comfortable there anymore and you're going to move out. Just like there's white flight, there's black flight.

- People moving in start opening fancier and more expensive stores that push out whatever cheaper stores that were there before which both reduces the number of "normal" stores in the area and makes them more expensive to shop at because the owners can now charge higher rents.

- Greedy landlords who own a lot of buildings in the neighborhood try to get people to move legally (offering them money to leave) or illegally (harassment of various sorts).  




 Way to misrepresent what the article said.

One of the reasons why some people believe that women are less suitable to become jockeys is that being a jockey requires tremendous arm and core strength  you need muscle in order to stay in control of your horse. Unfortunately, there are still few women who have the skill and body strength needed to race horses at the professional level.

Of course, there are more complex matters to deal with  women also often have to take a break if they become mothers, and the industry waits for absolutely no one. If a rider leaves, they just hire someone else to ride their horses for them. This creates tough competition, which leaves some trainers and owners more reluctant to hire women because of the off-chance that their rider becomes pregnant and unable to race. 




 Elevating your feet relieves the pressure that builds up over the course of the day, moreso if you did a lot of walking or standing. 




 Horse racing is not particularly popular compared to other sports. Every day when I listen to the news on the radio, horse racing results are never mentioned except for the Triple Crown races.

As for why people like horse racing, well, go to a track and see for yourself. It really is very exciting to watch, and it's no different than watching human track and field events. People go nuts over Usain Bolt and he ran 100 meters in 10 seconds. That was the whole race. Ten seconds. By that standard, two minutes is a long time. 




 I don't know if they're aware they're in a competition but thoroughbreds are bred to be good racers and, just as importantly, to enjoy racing. They don't only run in packs -- when they're training they often train alone and a horse that isn't into it, so to speak, will never be motivated to race.

As for whether they understand that they've won, I doubt that too, but they are rewarded for winning so they're certainly aware that they've done a good job. 




 The poor neighborhoods tend to lack good public transportation and amenities, and are further away from Manhattan. People with money don't want to live there because of the sheer inconvenience of it. 

It has little to do with rent control because there are rent controlled buildings all over the city, including in areas that are very, very expensive.  




 No, for various reasons, but the simplest one is that it's not in the spirit of the day. The idea is to separate yourself from ordinary activities and make the day spiritual. 




 You left off the second bit. "organized activity in support of women's rights and interests" 




  Feminism means women are treated the same to men.

No, it doesn't. It means advancing women's issues, some of which have nothing to do with being treated the same as men. 




 Thrid Wave Feminism has done a lot of damage to the feminist movement.

Not really true. Second Wave feminism was not any more popular than Third Wave is and they had plenty of their own extremist kooks. Feminism has always been a dirty word.

 I saw the movie. I felt like if I hadn't read the book I might not have entirely understood what was going on, and I didn't think the ending had nearly as much power. Though it did leave out some of the more boring bits from the book. 

Is it worth reading just for the last page? That's a tough question. A number of rock stars consider it their favorite book. If saying that makes you curious to find out why, then yes, it's worth reading. But if you couldn't care less what rock stars think, then possibly not worth it -- though, it's short and fairly easy reading so if you've got nothing better to read, you could do worse. 




 I don't think you're thinking of the right book considering it's only 200 pages long. 




 - Perfume by Patrick Suskind. Redeemed by literally the last page.

- Outlander by Diana Gabaldon. I wouldn't say the ending redeemed it but I was genuinely shocked by the events of the last 50-100 pages or so, so it gained back some stars. I ended up rating it 3/5 stars instead of 2 or even 1.  




 I haven't heard anything. If I do, I'll update. 




 I'm on a mailing list that sent out a request to say tehillim for Moshe  Shlomo Ben Sara Tova who was hit by a van in New York. They say he's in critical condition. If you can, please add him to your prayers.

 I thought the commentary was actually better than the movie. 




 For the guys, the opposite question here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/38583n/men_of_reddit_whats_the_most_feminine_thing_that/ 




 I wouldn't, for basically the same reason. Private gives satisfaction an even more internal feel. Sometimes you're satisfied with something and then you tell someone about your experience but your private satisfaction is something for you alone.

I've worked as an editor and I'll definitely nitpick something to death, but I think in this case you're being overly literal. In the example below some of the deletions work but some of them take the flavor out of the sentence, leaving it dull and dry. Unless you're writing a textbook, you're not just trying to convey information -- a distinctive and interesting style makes a story better. 




 In Germany, only 30% of students go to college; more than twice as many American students do.  




 I have no idea what you're referring to, but the two groups of people who are most opposed to snitching are children and criminals, neither of whom should be anybody's role model. As an adult naturally you should first try to handle situations on your own, but if that's not possible there's nothing wrong with elevating the issue to someone with more authority than you.  




 Close should(!) be removed since it's redundant with intimacy, but I wouldn't remove the own. "My own" something is a colloquial phrase that may seem redundant but isn't because it adds an additional layer of ownership. Take "my apartment" versus "my own apartment." The first is merely information, the second is personal. 




 The question is, how would your sister and brother-in-law react to other forms of discipline from you aside from yelling? Would they accept your saying to their daughter, "No, we don't hit people" or putting her in a time out? If they would be okay with that, try it. It takes time, but I believe even small amounts of discipline from other relatives can somewhat counteract a lack of discipline at home. 

But if they won't let you discipline their kid, you need to keep your daughter safe and if that means keeping her away from her cousin entirely, that's the way it has to be.  




 You're not supposed to eat over your plate, but otherwise, I don't think you're being overly strict at all.

 I marked this NSFW but it doesn't have to be a sexual fantasy, maybe you fantasize about going BASE jumping but you know you're really too chicken to do it. 




 Sexism, mostly. For the longest time women were treated like commodities so they've internalized the idea that in order to get money, it's an "acceptable" idea to sell oneself. While men have not been socialized to think that, so for a man to become a prostitute he generally needs to have fallen about as far as possible in society so that no other options are available to him (you see this a lot in books and movies about heroin addicts).

But there's also the reverse sense that women's sexuality has been suppressed for so long that it's still largely considered unacceptable and/or comfortable for a woman to do things like go to a strip club or a hire a prostitute. 




 Just read it instead of pre-judging based on what you think you know about 14-year-old girls who are trying to avoid getting murdered by Nazis. 




 I haven't read the book, but after reading articles about it, I'm very much on board with the concept. 




 It's nothing to do with scary movies -- a lot of movies do this now. It's just a popular way of making commercials nowadays and has no particular meaning, though it's an easy way of keeping the information in front of you the whole time. 




 This is a yes or no question, though people may argue about it based on their accent or their perception of how the words should be pronounced. Better to ask in /r/askreddit.

 mugenhunt is right, this is all about expectations and nothing about sensitivity to pain. There's women's wrestling and boxing and, as women were "created" for (/s), childbirth, all of which women tolerate just fine. 




 Bishop Coughlin was notorious for having an anti-Semitic radio show in the 1930s.

 As the song says, "I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all." One type of depression involves numbness rather than any specific negative feelings. And when you're that numb, you don't even feel like you exist. The pain tells you that you are, in fact, still alive. 




 I guess I can give it another shot, but if it's really 100 pages that you have to push through -- I'm not sure I have the patience for that. 




 How many buildings are there with micro-apartments in NYC? Two? Three? I don't see any evidence that they're growing in popularity. 




 According to Wikipedia, the Panchatantra was the most frequently translated work from India... in 1924. I'm not so sure it's true anymore; I never even heard of it. I would think the most commonly translated works from India would be the Kama Sutra, the vedas or the Mahabharata.

 I just came across an interview with him that was posted two weeks ago, but I hadn't read. Here's what jumped out at me:

And it is a book that requires, like a television series, an audience. This cannot be sustained by grants  which, I've never gotten one. This cannot be sustained by the publisher alone. If the readers don't turn out for it, if the ratings aren't high enough, this will not see a conclusion.

Welp. This certain strengthens my resolve not to keep reading.

I have 10 volumes. But in writing the tenth, I ... understood intimately how to re-write the first. So now I'm going back and  it was literally a page one re-write for Volume 1, and Volume 2 was the same. 

So yeah, this is why you're supposed to finish your first draft then go back and edit. I'd be willing to read an edited version of volume 1.

 You don't need a prologue -- you're supposed to just jump right into the story and all these bits of information are supposed to come out as the story progresses. Instead, MZD did the opposite -- gave us a lot of information and no story and no character development either. I didn't feel that I knew Xanther and her family (or any other characters) any better at the end of the book than I did after each of their first appearances. 

I don't know what's going to happen, but the orb chapters in particular made me think of Lost, which was such a let-down in the end that I regretted watching it. I don't want to go through that again. I'm perfectly willing to wait 10 years until it's finished to read it if it ends up being worth it. 




 If you have recycling in your area, recycle it.  




 This first book largely should not have existed. It was just a prologue and much of it was repetitive or even useless. Even if the second book is better, I got a very strong whiff of Lost; I will not invest 50+ hours of my life to a series that will ultimately disappoint.
 




 For the exact same variety of reasons that non-Orthodox and non-Jewish women do.  




  But you do want to live in New York City?
 other people do, too
 That's why rent is expensive here; 

Earlier in the thread you were against the suggestion that people should be required to live in the apartments they've bought and here you're claiming that they do, and that's why rent is so high. You're contradicting yourself.

Rent is not high because so many people want to live here. Rent is high because rich people want to invest their money in apartments that they will never (or hardly ever) live in, which increases the number of luxury buildings built and luxury conversions created, thereby decreasing the number of apartments that would otherwise be available for people who actually want to live here. 




 Plenty of co-ops in Manhattan have a rule that you're not allowed to buy an apartment as a pied-a-terre.  




 A lot of co-ops in Manhattan have a rule that you're not allowed to buy an apartment as a pied-a-terre. But most of these are condos and they're not as strict because the ownership structure is different. 




 It's not so much not true as outdated. Nowadays SJW's have supplanted Jews in being the conscience of the world and, if possible, people hate them even more than Jews.

During the early- and middle-20th century when Jews were at the forefront of science, culture, civil rights, animal rights, and environmentalism. This didn't endear us to people who were largely against these things (aside from science). 




 Broken Monsters by Lauren Beukes has a fake Reddit threads in it.

Recommended for anybody who liked True Detective. It's very similar in some ways. 




 Helen Mirren would beg to differ. 

Anyway, what you're saying isn't true. It's about what people are used to and the inability to accept that just because something is what's currently done, doesn't mean that's the way it *has* to be done.

Before Bridesmaids nobody thought a female-centric comedy would fly. But ever since, they've been making more like it. Not because they're SJW's and they give a damn about women, but because they'll make whatever sells. And surprise, it sells. 

If they made more movies with actresses that were older, nobody would think twice about it and it would make just as much money as it would otherwise. Somebody just has to have the guts to make that movie and prove it.
