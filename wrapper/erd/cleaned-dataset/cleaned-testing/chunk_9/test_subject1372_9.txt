 Could I get some mice noodles and kung-bow-wow chicken? 









 Interesting. 




 I'm not that talented. Most of my tracks suck compared to what other people have done for their games. The feedback is appreciated. Now go suck your own dick to feel better from being way too butthurt about my explanations. 




 Not to mention he wrote "down" where "door" should be. 




 This is actually an old creepypasta that was probably posted here for people to find. I doubt OP wrote it. 




 I wonder if it's in any part because it's just an open beta. Otherwise, seriously M2K? Some new changes come out and you want to bag on them instead of try to embrace them and adjust? How is he even still playing Smash 4 if that's the case? 




 Oh god, after hearing all of this criticism, I need to make my own announcer so there's an alternative. 




 "Do lesbians like butt-sex like gay guys? Because I'm totally into that if you know what I mean." 




 They should process refunds now. They look like they're begging for *once more chance* from that ex-girlfriend who only used you for free meals and was seeing Joe Shmoe on the side. 




 I have the entire To The Moon soundtrack. I know what song you're talking about. This is just a soundtrack-oriented release. Only certain parts of the song are used, and the in-game version will be mixed differently with slightly higher BPM. The parts I do use loop nicely without fading out and/or starting back up again after ending.

All things considered, I understand the redundant criticisms I've gotten so far. And if you would play the game and hear it within its context, it would make more sense. But, soundcloud, for me anyway, is only meant for the soundtrack-oriented releases of the music.

This is why I really wish Reddit wasn't either a Link or Text agenda. I really wish I could leave a link and still have text without having it put it into a comment that is likely to be buried underneath the dribble. 




 "is your refrigerator running?"

"As you can clearly see, I don't have a cartoon fridge so it would not be, SHUT UP LISA I'M ON THE PHONE. JUST CHANGE INTO YOUR SEXY CLOTHES AND I'LL BE THERE... Sorry about that. You know how daughters are." 




 "We are Hollywood Undead here to record our new holiday album for ya bitches." 




 It feels much better in game, since not the entire song is used. It's just a soundtrack version. 









  It's its own entity,

 I wouldn't want Apple doing anything like this until all of their base models include GPUs. I don't see anybody spending 2k on a mac just to make sure it has a proper GPU in it. Unless they just took off with a new series of machines dedicated to the necessities of gaming where pixels need to be pushed out quickly. Right now, the GPUs Apple puts in are better for accurate pictures, but not fast pictures. And that's the big reason Apple still has this crude separation from gaming.

But, it's not impossible, and probably not even far-fetched in any means. Swift is now open source and is good for developing apps on a lot of platforms. So maybe this will bring a huge streamline to cross-platform development when it comes to which platform is getting all the games. People have developed for Windows purely because it was popular and re-developing for Mac required having a mac + some special software. With Swift going open source, this could be the huge gateway to get one language to code for everything so devs only spend a little more time making a new version to reach millions of more potential customers.

It's a dream. 




 I'm sorry, but who else was 'competing' for this patent? 




 Well, as if I didn't already have a good enough reason to not play Destiny. 




 Yeah, cause we want melee at Apex... and PM too. 




 Awe well. I just hope when I finally get a Mac of my own for my design work, it will be worth it. 




 I hate that you used to be able to open up most of their computers and upgrade the Ram and Hard Drive yourself. A simple tutorial away. But now it seems like everything is soddered in to make sure you don't and for Apple to preserve the unibody look. 




 You mean they're now doing what dozens of smaller game stores have been doing forever? Good job Gamestop. Still not shopping there. 




 "You're doing that too much. Please wait 23 hours before posting again.

"Don't want to wait? Download our $1.99 plug in to skip this wait up to three times a day. Or our $5.99 to skip this wait forever." 




 "Have a good first day at school..." 




 "Oh, God. How come nobody here can beat the meat before putting it on a damn grill?" 




 GameCube FTW. 




 If you can get it, I'd say get it. There will be games exclusive to new 3DS but not the standard 3DS. Improved battery life, improved 3D, auto brightness, comfy in your hands, improved button layout.

The 3DS is not going to be obsolete for a few more years. Nintendo isn't stupid enough to just release a new console while their current gen offerings are still young. 




 You say that like they have plenty of left over staff to port large portions of old libraries to a virtual environment with no real guarantee that the efforts will pay the staff and then some. 




 In Nintendo's Defense, anything before the Wii wasn't a gimmick with controls. DS seemed like pure gimmick, but it something that definitely works when executed correctly. So I wouldn't can that just another Gimmick. And let's be glad the 3DS isn't just a DSi with a 3D screen, but a very competent handheld with extremely fun games to play. Yeah, yeah, low res, whatever, still way too much fun on one handheld. 




 I'm not a big fan of achievements. Games should be replayed because of replay value. Not for gamer points. 




 Name: Ultra Nintendo Entertainment System.

Rest assured, it will be comparable to any current system with lower power consumption.

Compatible with GameCube to USB adapters and there will be developer APIs so every game can use it from launch.

This built upon what OP said should put Nintendo back on #1 slot. 




 Ness will suck a little less. Just a little. 




 Wow. You're equating Amiibo to a store-specific preorder costume? Apples to oranges dude. Anyone can get an Amiibo, not everyone can get a pre-order. Not only that, but you're paying once for a figure that can unlock content in multiple games or claim daily rewards for some games. Not the same as other companies doing on-disc DLC.

And people are very right when they say the content is NEVER significant to say you're not enjoying a full game. If Amiibo was used to lock content such as extra levels or important items that could help you complete the game, then it would be a problem. But, even without the game, you have a decorative and collectable figure on your shelves. Other DLC does not give you anything like that. If a new game comes out with on-disc DLC, you gotta buy it. And if that DLC stops being supported, then you're fucked. If a new game comes out with Amiibo support, and you already have the Amiibo, then you're already bought that content. And it will never stopped being supported since you don't have to download it.

Amiibo-specific content being on the disc makes sense for this reason. If the game had to download content or checked a server every time an Amiibo was tapped, it would get very annoying very fast.

Nintendo did it much differently. The concept may be similar, but at least they did it in a fun and enjoyable way. And not buying Amiibo does not stop you from enjoying any game's main content.

Some people see it that way. But let me make it clear that **Nintendo is not getting a free pass for anything.** we still hate how hard to get they are. The price is pretty steep if you only want 1 Amiibo to use in 1 game for 1 time. Some of the content isn't worth an Amiibo you don't already have. And yes, it does suck that there isn't a way to access to content without one. But asking for that would be like saying developers should make all DLC unlock able so we can all play it for free. And those who paid simply didn't want to work to unlock it. It'd be a bad business model if nobody had to buy an Amiibo.

Nintendo had to sell some, and they weren't just going to let everyone have everything for free. So everyone can take their hate for Amiibo and shove it up their ass. If you're complaining about them not being abundant or available, I understand. But just hating on it because you see it as insignificant in-disc DLC enablers, then just stfu. We get it.

 Is good to see another fan of skyward sword. It was my favorite Zelda game before Majora's Mask 3D came out. I'm very sad that I do not play it more often. I have to share a screen with a family, so my  3DS has been filing the roll of main Console.

Feel free to hit me up if you'd ever like to discuss the game. And, I think there is a position to increase your overall stamina. There are a few ocarina cheat codes that I deal make the game more enjoyable with actually cheating at anything. 




 That's a strange predicament. I did dig up my old DS. The big brick from 07. I can use that for something. I think I can get what I want soon enough. 




 Wouldn't I need a Japanese DS? 




 I tried. Everything leads to the Masuda method. 




 I personally think both of them are awful is many places. iOS loves to rely on this transparency that adds nothing to the function and only takes away from usability even if by a little bit. Android seems to be way too flashed up and decorated for its own good depending on the version. 




 I don't have a GEN 6 game, and I honestly don't give a fuck what's easier on Gen 6. I'm doing Gen 5 right now. 




 ??? How does this help me bread a shiny? 




 Not trying to be competitive. Just having fun working for bragging rights. Lol. 




 I don't have a Gen 6 game.

Even if I got one tomorrow, I wouldn't put this down just to play the other one just yet. Trying to finish this one and do whatever fun stuff I can on it before I jump to Gen 6. 




 I take this with a grain of salt. This in no way proved Ryu will be part of the game. #BrawlVault. 




 ...Let's see, how could we have easily faked this...

Brawl + file replacement codes + Ryu hack + greninja hack + capturing the right stuff + putting music over the video. 




 I'm in the IE, looking to trade for a non-English Audino to help me breed a shiny. If anyone is interested, PM me. Don't comment. 




 Thanks for the information. 




 I'm playing Black on a New3DS actually. Been playing Majora's Mask on 3DS for a while now. Just recently got back into pokemon thanks to a friend lending me his copy of Black.

I probably should have mentioned all that. 




 I only ask because I'm trying to breed a shiny Audino and read that using a foreign pokemon with a non-foreign pokemon to breed yields the biggest chance for breeding one. Believe me, I don't want to hatch 8,000 eggs before I hatch a shiny.

But I'm only on Pokemon Black. As far as I'm concerned, /r/pokemontrades is meant for generation VI.

How could I possibly get my hands on a foreign Audino when nobody I know has a foreign version of the game/foreign DS? I can't, right? I'm in Southern California, and it flourishes with pokemon players, but not people on Gen V who play non-English copies.

Am I pretty much screwed?

 Yeah, I had to educate my girlfriend's parents about scams like this. It's impossible for some random company to see a virus on your computer. If they do see it, then they're looking at your computer's files and information without your knowledge and permission witch is a cyber crime. If anyone calls saying they see a virus on your computer, then it's fake. And they actually had paid around $80 to install some **fix** which was just spying software. I had to remove it and tell them they were scammed and to cancel their current credit cards just to be safe.

 Okay now it makes more sense. 




 I don't understand  




 You should have tried windows 7 instead of Windows 8. And this is coming from a mac user. Anybody could have told you that 7 is an almost infinitely better experience than 8. 




 Mostly, the operating system and is ecosystem. They are very tight knit. Instead of having some stuff picked out and made by one company and another company making changes and/or addons that are hot and miss, Apple is very strict about how they go about getting the product to you. They make the operating system and design it for the hardware that they themselves have handpicked. It's like putting two and two together to make for by one person who knows the math. The other side is like someone making  a two and then buying a fraction he thinks is equal to two.

I really like the feel of the operating system. And the parts in the computer are not just fast but stable. I would sacrifice 20% of speed for maximum stability any day.

And many people claim it is entirely out of the lack of popularity, but I disagree. Unix and Linux are simply built with security deeper in mind than Windows ever was. The fact that Mac was built off of a core that had networking and specurity as priority is a big peace of mind. Apple on paper and in practice had proven to be less vulnerable.

 So, some people are starting to maybe come to there senses. Seriously, this mass surveillance is a waste of money, a waste of time, and an overload of useless data that buries anything that could actually be used.

They can't give us that bullshit about how stopping this means we're stopping the spying on known terrorists and criminals. If they were *known* terrorists and criminals, then wouldn't we have a warrant for their arrest and their asses in jail? 




 Summoning of Chimeratech Fortress Dragon cannot be done during the battle phase as it is a fusion summon that can only happen during your own Main Phase. If it was something that can be done at any time, then it would be broken against Machine decks or even with DNA surgery. With DNA surgery, you would change everything to Machine-type monsters and simply tribute every monster on the field for Chimeratech Fortress dragon whenever you wanted (assuming there is a Cyber Dragon in play).

If Chimeratech's text said you can do it during the Battle Phase, or if it required the effect of a quick-play spell card, then it would have been alright.
