 Sometimes quitting illustrator and reopening it fixes stuff like that. That's a weird one though.  




 You can enable NPC dialogue in the chat window, which is basically subtitles. 




 This [entire series](https://www.behance.net/gallery/19605733/atomic?) is pretty rad. 




 Yes. He was incredible. 









 With the way Apple's app discovery process currently works, that is actually good design. The app title and keywords are the best way to rank. It may be ugly but that doesn't make it poorly designed. 









 Yeah my laptop is great for work but it isn't the best for video games :D 














 What is your daughter interested in right now? What lessons did you or do you plan to teach your daughter? What sort of things would you like to read about to your daughter?  














 It showed up in the youtube sidebar as a suggested video based on [the video in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/380bul/patient_with_antisocial_personality_disorder/). I didn't search for anything. 




 It really saddened me when she started to talk about having kids. 









 Like how he said he had respect for women and would never hurt a woman but then went on to talk about how he hit a woman for getting up in his face and threw another women out of a window and broke her ribs. 




 I thought I was crazy for being so bothered by this on an otherwise very well done bit of motion design. Guess I'm not alone :) 




 These are all great points and incredibly helpful, thank you! 









 Maybe they actually created it all in yarn and staged and photographed it. 




 You can download the brush kit from a Russian guy on deviant art. 



















 Do you think it has helped during times when you are depressed? 




 You say you have practiced for the past two years, I'm curious how it has helped you.  




 Some subreddits allow for nsfw stuff as long as you tag it as such. 




 This.

The level design and quest text is pretty amazing. 









 Try blinking the stars at different times instead of one group that gets brighter and dimmer. 




 Thanks! I like your hover effect :D 




 Toggl is amazing. 




 Empathy is a pretty good tool to work on for most designers. 




 Being a designer is pretty awesome. In the last three years, my professional activities as characterized by type of design are:

 * Content Design (content strategy, content marketing, etc)
 * Game Design
 * Graphic Design
 * Illustration
 * Industrial Design
 * Information Design (content audits, site maps, mock-ups, etc)
 * Media Design
 * Motion Design
 * Packaging Design
 * Product Design
 * Software Design (wireframing, user-centered design, etc)
 * Usability Design
 * User-Centered Design
 * User Experience Design (rapid prototyping, user flows, user scenarios, etc)
 * User Interface Design (user interaction, user-centric, etc)
 * Web Design (responsive web, typography, etc)

One of my favorite things about being a designer is the amount of new things there are to learn and old things there are to get better at. The best advice I can give is probably the same advice you can get for almost any career path, that is to never stop learning. 

As for getting work for your portfolio just make stuff. Do you have an idea you think would make a good app? Mock up some UI designs or some user flow charts. Interview a dozen people about a problem you think you can design a solution for and create a list of user needs, then go prototype out some solutions. You don't have to do client work to get a portfolio :)

Lastly it helps if you spend some free time honing your craft. Drawing every day really helps with so many aspects of the job for example.

 It is worth taking this advice just for the experience of learning all about small claims court.
