 What are some of the red flags you talked about? 




 Turn off melee attack assist, promote skill target and autotargetting, they really mess with the gameplay! 




 I feel mesmers portal will be amazing for quickly moving supply back and spawn some npc's then quickly use the portal again grab some more, I think it'll be interesting seeing how everyone's playstyles will change and adapt to the new game mode and map. 




 Thieves, engineers and mesmers are the main ones I see roaming in most games. 




 Who would let such a small child ride such a powerful beast? 




 I did it once, my girlfriend stills laughs about it because it was so unexpected. 




 The cool down is tied to the ram not the player if I remember correctly. 




 Go to your bank and preview some armour find some you like and just Google where to obtain them easiest way to get a look you like. 




 You have to realise that not everyone is doing it to gain an advantage, some are just playing with their friends, but it can get annoying I agree. 




 I like to join groups with ele's, guardians and warriors so I can be sure that I'll get some might. 




 Woah that kid looks like Brad Pitt 




 () I want gerrrrrmmmss 




 Ah I see, thank you for the clear explanation! 




 Can you explain what the VIP system is/ does? 




 Last rank of what? Is this pvp or wvw or what? 




 AH, STAYIN' ALIVE! 




 Reflects 




 Created a new character after the update and was surprised to see the new lay out for the proffessions came with the update!

 Nice find looks like you could be right; I like the sound of the leaked skills i really hope the bow is a decent weapon. 




 As a level 52 you're at a major disadvantage, yes you get boosted to 80 but your stats will not be as high as an actual level 80 with full gear, you really have no chance until you're level 80 yourself and have your gear and traits, just run with the zerg try and stay out of the way and toss some grenades in there, also if you're getting chased Rocket Boots, turn around Net shot then run for your life and don't forget to use Caltrops on toolkit to slow them down and your block as you run away (If you think they can still hit you). 




 Some mini games would be nice, like the ones from that place i can't quite remember right now.

The firing range and shield/sword training, i mean they can help with reaction times, they could even make the trainer for sword training a giant golem that puts up a bubble shield so it wouldn't look silly with a few people doing it at the same time, it's relevant to pvp at least. 




 Was this kid called spongebob?
