 Hi 2X.  This is a throwaway.  

So, I've recently been put on Wellbutrin, about a month ago, for depression, which is scaring me a lot.  But I'm not sure if my depression is the cause of my sadness with my boyfriend (and school, but that's another can of worms) or if the problems with school/boyfriend are causing the depression.

My boyfriend and I have been together 2.5 years, and we moved in together in May.  he moved across the country for it (I had gone to grad school across the country).  So, we are far away from any family support.  At that time I was *so sure* that we were going to be together for quite some time, I really was.  I'd never felt that way before.

Now fast forward about six months.  I want to end things with him.  It scares me to be with the same person since I was 21 (I'm 24) and he feels like he wants to be with me forever.  I do not feel that way anymore.  I don't feel the same way about him as I did.  At all.  As clich as it is, I love him but I'm not *in* love with him.  

However, I don't know if this is all because of this depression shit, or real feelings.  Anyone have any advice? It would be so greatly appreciated.

TL;DR--is my depression causing me to not love my boyfriend anymore? 




 That was very useful, thank you :)  I guess part of the problem is I don't really have a family support system, even if they are far away.  Some stuff transpired that kind of ripped us apart, for a silly reason I think.  

We are very lucky.  I am glad to hear that someone who has been there is also feeling better, it makes me happy :)
