 Phone saves the barber.
 




 All he has to do is double jump at the window across of him and press B to hang onto the ledge. 




 Took a while for my eyes to focus but I yeah I noticed him too. 




 Walmart clearance sale. There was a post about it yesterday. Theory is since they're bringing in the new 1TB consoles they want to get rid of the stock they have. 




 Where's Chris Brown when he's needed? 




 Can't we just do it with Will again and pretend he's not old?? 




 Butt hurt American?? I assume so. 




 Oh god remember Jenny? What a bitch. 




 His rhythm is horrible, he loses it by the third poke. 




 This is also true. 




 No, no you can't. I'd be charged one count of vagina slaughter with the use of a deadly penis. 


I can't go back there woman!! 




 No shit Sherlock. What I'm saying is I would've liked it to be a VR headset not AR as I do not see many practical uses for it with games. But yea, fuck me for having an opinion right? Assholes. 




 Perhaps stop putting your name on your accounts?? 




 Mine just shows no videos available constantly for the past few months. I've re-installed countless time to no avail. Fuck the Youtube App. 




 Sounds gimmicky. I just want to put a headset on and be transported to another world. Not put a headset on and be in my room with a constricted view. 




 Lego Batman, couldn't pass up that amazing offer. 









 Witcher 3. Not really like batman but if you like story and side missions you can't go wrong. 




 Like other people have mentioned, use your signs. Between Quen and Aard you should be able to kill it with no problem (Use Quen before going into battle that way you can use Aard as soon as you start fighting to get him out of the sky). Also don't dodge with being monsters, use roll instead 




 Guacamelee Super Turbo Championship Edition is **DOPE** 




 VR **is** the way to go. Honestly I don't see much use for this in gaming apart from minecraft. 




 50-60?? Dude that bordering on slave labour. In my country the standard is around 35-40 hours (i.e 8 hours a day). That sucks. 




 These comments have hurt my brain. WTF is going on? 




 If you were a child I'm betting you would be saying he ruined Christmas. I know personally I would've flipped my pre-pubescent nuts. 




 Now this would be a good reboot. 




 Why don't we use "The more you know" Banner for these types of memes? (Family guy's one is possible please and thank you) 




 I prefer a threat you can see to one you can't any day, except opposite day. 




 Do you want a new phobia?

Because that's how you get a new phobia 




 Surely that just confirms they are westerners therefore more valuable??  




 Nice try /u/cynic_male alternate throw-away account. 




 *Insert Insanity Wolf Meme Here* 




 Nature on nature crime, when will they learn!? 




 I've tried Hershey's once, let's say my taste buds didn't classify it as chocolate. 




 ....Well, fuck. I've got/do about 80% of those things. Is it something that could get worse or develop with time? Cause these past few years I've just been getting increasingly socially awkward etc. Sorry for asking so many questions but I think I may be onto something here. 




 #AH DOYYYYYY


Now that the hype is over people are actually realising what a useless piece of technology it really is. It's like a remote for your phone which is probably in your pocket already. Not needed. 




 What are the traits of aspergers? Curios cause I think I may ahve a mild case of it. Never been tested though out of fear for it being true. 




 Bitches be trippin. 




 Oh don't worry, they'll fuck him. They'll fuck him loooong and **hard**. 




 Should Air drop a million cups sponsored (and blessed) by the Vatican into Pakistan. 




 He's not really. How many people of died from cancer vs how many people have died in the name of religion? I don't know for sure but I'm guessing religion is winning by a few million people if not more. 




 Yes we know, we all saw the Boar video yesterday and read the comments too. 




 I wasn't prepared, I'm all mushy now. 




 Why the hell would the cut the tree?? That sucks. 




 That's what created the theory that Garfield is in fact alone and John and Odie are part of his imagination. 




 Why is Bill Cosby making another round on reddit?? Has there been a development? 









 Dude, you guys don't have Aero? How do you make Aero mint cakes!? 




 I just don't understand how a product like this can be produced. How it can go from deign to manufacture with no one along the way pointing it out is beyond me. 




 I would've been like fuck you too man. I'm here to collect balls, not bugs. If I wanted to collect bugs I would be a bug collector or something. Am I right? 




 Those teeth! That's what you call Danger Head, better hope she don't sneeze and clench her jaw. 




 Black Flag is the only game I think they did right apart from the first 2. For me it is the one that looks most different to the other and therefor gives it a different feel. 


At the beginning of Assassins Creed I was really excited for the series. Imaging every game would be set in a completely different time period and country (i.e Egypt during the reigns of the Pharaohs, China during the Ming Dynasty, England during the Industrial Revolution, America during the Revolution etc etc) but every game from Assassins creed 1-3 felt the same. They took too long to realise the potential of the series.


Also on another note, wtf is up with Abstergo Entertainment?? I hope it really hasn't come to that, I hop I have to take them down in the end (Haven't finished the game yet). 




 Ahhh the dreaded K-hole. 




 I've been lucky enough to try it once, best meat I've ever tasted in my life. 




 Awesome thanks for the heads up!! 




 #Smell ma Butt. 




 Ahhh the olde Reddit [linkaroo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQoA_wjmE9w) 




 You just reminded me about this, haven't done it in a while! Thanks! 




 Please don't give your money to Bungie. Buy Halo Instead. Pretty Please?? 




 Your Youtube works!? 




 Basically... Everything is Awesome!! 




 EA Access is worth the $20 a year. Should give it a look. Also Risk if you like those sort of games to play with friends. Another one is Dying Light, not an exclusive but a reallyyy fun game. 




 Fine, but I'm still not happy about it. 




 Too bad it didn't last. Didn't even get to try it. I'm hoping they had to take it down because CDPR has something in the pipelines but who knows. 




 Awwww mannnnnnnn, I didn't get a chance to try it out. Why has it been taken down? Did CDPR get in touch? Do they have something in the pipeline?? 




 Damn I just paid 18 in the UK. That around $25....I think we need some freedom over here. 




 Fantastic? You just beat the system to a pulp, it's more than Fantastic..It's like Super Fantastic, um yeah that's it. 




 You sir, you are the Real Batman. Muchos thanks! 




 Ok fine it's not the worst one made, yes I was being a touch dramatic but it was just really infuriating because it felt like a step backwards instead of forward. Now though since it wasn't included in the last game they are more likely to not have the option again in this game. Match customization was a big part of the game for my friends and I so I apologise but I fell quite strongly since the WWE games have been a part of my life since forever. 




 I keep seeing this everywhere expect my Xbox Store, argh!!! I want it (but not at full price) can someone link it?


Edit: https://store.xbox.com/en-GB/Xbox-One/Bundle/LEGO-Batman-3-Beyond-Gotham-Deluxe-Edition/e1af57f3-d527-4c7c-affc-cb300cbfc7f0    someone was kind enough to provide me with an actual link. Enjoy guys! 




 I check the Xbox site and Batman is still full price, where are you getting these from? 




 I just hope they bring back match customisation, wtf were they thinking. WWE 2k15 = worst Wrestling game ever. 




 #meh


This 2K series has killed the franchise for me. No match customisation in the last game was the last straw. 




 TIL it's ends meet not ends meat. Make a lot more sense tbh. 




 That sucks, sorry. 




 So day off work or does everything continue as normal? 




 Our thoughts are with you through this unfortunate time in your life. Keep strong and chin up! 




 Ouch, the knees took a good slamming. 




 I'm no Marine Biologist but my theory is it's fishing. Let's it's tentacles hang like that and if any fish is stupid enough to swim into them he will have hi way with it. But like I said, it's just my theory. 




 It's Monday, it's early. I'm sorry. 




 Thanks! 




 Since we're on the subject on making the sub better and with less cluster could we please **Insert title of game into Post Title!!** Thanks! 




 Can't wait for summer to be over! 




 What's the name of the game please??


Edit: I know, it's in the title. It's Monday morning, give me a break!

 IDK about you but I would lose my appetite if I knew I was going to die too. 




  watching ladies in tight clothing shake it.

That's what push your over the edge isn't it?? 




 #filters..

#Edit: I JUST FOUND OUT WHAT HASHTAG DOES 




 I was coming to say the same thing. OP's a douche but great Confession bear material. So I guess he's even. 




 The cost of "freedom". 




 Saw it saw Jupiter as it approached Jupiter? I don't get it. 




 What do you think is keeping my water in the bottle? Sneaky sneaky double currency. ;) 




 So basically you won the house Lottery, and extra room for free. Congrats!
 




 I got gilded once, didn't really see the use of the extra features etc, just used Reddit as normal. I really don't see the point. 




 And gold wouldn't?? who the fuck would care about gold if shit hits the fan?? You're better carrying around a couple of litres of water. 




 We should all take to his twitter to call him a "corrupt heathen". Just saying, it would be fun to see his reaction. 




 Awesome, now can they fix the "downloading latest playlist" thing so I can actually play? 




 Here's what you do, stop supporting Bungie. 




 My love grows more intense with every article. 









 It's just you're trying to defend a game which is blatantly bad. The only thing that game has going for it is the gun control, that's it. The rest of is is a grind with very little content to keep you engaged. I was as excited as the next guy for that game to come out, and as disappointed as the rest when it did. 




 But where's the challenge?? 




 Can anyone explain what's going on?? I just woke up. 




 What I don't understand is the fact that they are trying to build a file on this guy. Why is she trying to get his prints? He also claims she asked for his number. 




 You're welcome! Hope we get to see more soon :) 




 ....dude. *stands ups and claps* 




 What the hell is with the guy in the Land Rover? 




 But that's logic, we don't do logic.
 




 That last comment was a nice conclusion.


"Not smart." 




 Wasn't it with every copy?? not just pre-ordered?? 




 I was hoping for the AC series to be completely different. i.e what they hinted in the first game in Desmond's room. I though each game would be set in a different time period in different parts of the world, granted it technically was but they all felt the same. I was hoping for one in China during the Ming dynasty, another in Egypt during the time of the Ferros etc etc. Instead we got the crap that they spewed out Abstergo Entertainment **FUCK OFF** 




 [Gears of War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccWrbGEFgI8). Enough said, close thread.
