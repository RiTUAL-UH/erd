 Or, go to the professor and talk and tell them what had been going on and how to pass. Professors will help you and even pass you if you're willing to improve and go to their office hours. 




 Try and get a leave of absence due to your depression. I did this and it was very easy. My psychiatrist just wrote my diagnosis and that I should take a leave. Good luck 




 Criminal minds! It's great because its always on TV ha 




 Hmm. That sounds really interesting to me. I've been on an epistemology/spirituality/quantum physics train of thought lately. Every time I try and watch it though, I turn it off because it bores me. 




 It was a great movie and book. I have cried while reading all his books. Paper towns and looking for Alaska are next on the big screen and will have the same effect. 




 Neither are necessary. 




 Yeah but it sounds like you know what to do and have a plan. And you're motivated. This is just a hiccup in life. Dogs can be great for healing and company so think about that... Produce dopamine. 




 Uh not really 




 Twilight or kings crossing by Elliott Smith.  




 Thanks! Steppenwolf looks awesome 




 Ooh yeah. Well you need to get her to understand the changes in mood and potential of harm she can do. But, shed not going to listen to you if she's impulsive and unhealthy, that's on her and you can't really change that because she'll resent you and then rebel. So, it's kind of something she needs a therapist for. 

Since you're her big brother, she will take what you say and how you act with more emphasis than a parent. You're close in age and did it to. What she's doing isn't all that out of ordinary for a HS  student, but you may need to worry because she was a higher chance of addiction and risky behavior.  




 Good choice 




 Drugs and alcohol with mood disorders (or similar) do not mix. She'll end up feeling worse, it keep chasing the high. 




 You need to figure out yourself and who you are, not just the job you want. What you need in life should be found in some ways within your job.

A trade school or a life coach may help. 




 Two were surprising to me, still is but who cares. The other 2 I kind of l smelled something fishy, I was right. 




 Yeah, definitely. I enjoy it when we embrace and its more than just thrusting and I feel involved. I love sitting on top of him while he's sitting up against a wall or chair and riding. Same intimate feelings as missionary. 




 Really. I hate this question because they're all good. Can't be too picky 




 Mental marathon is a perfect description. This happened to me on independence day and I felt so sick, like the kind of lethargy after a panic attack. I don't have anyone to talk to anymore either. I try and people do like me and care for me, but never to the best friend/lover/first person I talk to extent. One inch at a time I will improve. I will go out. I will experience life and not take the backseat. I will think it and I will do it. 




 Oh, and as far as saint chappelle, I liked it and it was pretty quick. 




 Paris was crazy. I literally ran around the city to to each big landmark to make sure I fit it all in. Usually I'd say this doesn't work and not why I travel, but idk, I'm glad I did it. The only thing I'm mad about it not taking much time in the Louvre. That was on my bucket list but skipped through. 

Basically, its up to you. Is the culture or the landmarks more important to you, how do you feel about skipping many major places like the love lock bridge, arch, Louvre and other museums, a few awesome churches, etc. 




 Figure skating. What the fuck 




 Ask someone who has done it themselves. If you don't feel comfortable contacting an owner of a bar around you, ask around Reddit to pick some minds. 




 Yeah, my first thought as well.

But I see his point obv. 




 I bet 12% take something. 




 Because they have different priorities which changes their outlook (in theory). 




 Go on stumble upon or okay Yahtzee with buddies on your phone 




 That makes a lot of sense. 




 I hate this keyboard and autocorrect. 




 Yeah they're from my hometown and making headway across the US. Theyre one of those bands that are respected no matter if the person likes their music or not.

They told me theyd do another AMA here once their album comes out. 




 Damn. Chaturbate is going to get me into all kinds of trouble. 




 Yeah I thought it was a bent knee for about 30 seconds.  




 Got fucked over in about $250 in drug deal money through out my time. Blame it on the police 




 They have a product, I think it's called monkey butt or something similar. Made for your ass swear but works the same 




 High on what? 




 Yes, ruined my life.  




 I like Ohio. This is probably not someone's first choice but I do. 




 Reminds me of the babadook... And brainwashing. 




 And most places here will accept Canadian money. 




 I kind of think of it as my country too. I can hop the border for lunch, see the Falls anytime, and go to a specific store to pick something up for half an hour. A lot of Canadians come here as well, mostly to shop, so we integrate well. 




 As a person, how would you describe yourself? 




 Be prepared to out in more effort and work. Do participate in class, ask questions. One if the biggest things I regret was doing this and not going to a professors office hours to form a relationship. Definitely will help down the line with recommendations, plus networking is always a necessity. 

Oh, and as much as grades DO matter, if you pass you're okay and no one will care. 




 Free to be insane. Free to be unique. Obviously we have laws, but as a white female, I hide in the cracks. 




 Nope. Oatmeal could work though. 




 So what do you like to do? How do you have money? 




 Similar to any public service, I thought they were unfair until I needed them. I support it, but also believe in limitations. 




 Can't upvote enough! 




 Yeah I was hoping one she touched the memories at the beginning and made them sad, they'd make ALL them sad because that's how it feels. I looked too far into this movie psychologically  




 Love Pixar, had high expectations on this and felt let down because I was trying so hard to relate it to my brain. How did you feel about it? 




 I've had my leg hair look like that before. Winters are long and lonely. 




 A true man right here. 




 Download some podcasts or audio books 




 I like your outlook 




 Have him try this:

 Both are in the wrong. If the workers said that they should have been fired. The lady sucks though. 




 I mean let's review 




 Where's Picasso's? 




 So good.  Post pop punk is my groove. 




 No one knows my band either. Mostly because I don't have a band. 




 Not him but I am! 




 True. Theyre not my thing but it's sad how fast they faded after the hype from the song with soupy died down. 




 Only heard a few songs here and there but listened to their full albums today. So good! 









 $paid 




 $paid 




 Apparently I'm the only one that did not like this.
