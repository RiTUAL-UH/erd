 Bro. Just go full speedo brief. I know it may seem weird but the difference is astounding. All my teammates wear them and all professionals do. If my suit is exceptionally loose I might wear another brief under it but that's rare. Try it. Forget what other people think and play like a champ. 




 How do you like college so far? I was thinking about majoring in a similar field but I'm not 100% sure on it. Any advice?
