 Don't forget this bit

 I liken it to

My aim is to get my friends and family to do something, some people won't even clean cookies from their browser,
 




 I've had the best results getting people to take their privacy a bit more seriously with that same approach.

I liken it to a wheel-lock bar in a car, sure they're disabled by accomplished thieves easily - but why would they try when there's a car beside it that has none.

 I don't know for sure.

There's as much concern as to patents, seed ownership, cross-breeding rights, corporate monopolies on essentials etc. as there is to GMOs themselves.

As for the genetic modification side, I'm inclined to think they're safe.

Though then I remember about 15 years ago, a group scientists declared sections of our DNA 'junk' that had built up over the aeons of evolution. This became a widely held viewpoint, but then about 5 years later - the view changed to the 'junk' being part of epigenetic transmission from one generation to the next. So very much not 'junk'.

That all made me think that genetic modification is perhaps still to young a scientific endeavour for anyone to say for sure at this stage.

Plus, I think it's often a solution looking for a problem.

We produce more food than we need, we bin so much of it, we use land inefficiently - all the while there are many techniques for growing plants in hostile environments, soil remediation, the city farm in Japan that's producing huge quantities of food with drastically lower water requirements. All these things without a GMO in sight, and thus none of the legal ownerships concerns.

I think the medical / environmental concerns can take a back-seat to the reality that we really don't need them.

If someone was planning for a colony on Mars, I could see the need but here ... 




 Tnaiste: Officials in my dept should be complimented for looking to make appropriate arrangements for water grant

One of the many things that really annoys me about Irish politics is this fishing-for-compliments for people doing their jobs, or often demanding praise for it.

They get paid to do their jobs (which isn't done well frequently), it is not the product of volunteers.

  




 How about not making expensive phone calls in the Dil when you're meant to be working?

 




 Shadowbans?

I reckon most legitimate posters would message the mods, and the genuine time-wasters won't notice. 














 Fairly heavy falls for the last hour here in Navan, roads seem ok though. 




 This is the kind of rechecking of assumptions the whole world could benefit from. 




 News to me, and all the best to you. 




 If things go Canonicals way, Snappy will eventually replace the apt-get repository management tool. But why fix what isnt broken (and apt-get most certainly is not broken)? Because, by isolating apps and frameworks from each other and, as much as possible, from the OS kernel, you can realize unprecedented system stability and flexibility

Replace your "not broken" apt-gets with our internet-dependent breakables, special low-price today prior to the awkward climb-down later.
 




 That was almost as Bracing as it was Quisling 




 If you're feeling lonely   isolated, and if / or if not schizoid - you can comment and message me anytime - whether it's a lost uncle or an unhappy mind.

Defaulting to a worst outcome in this thread, well, that's not compassion and it does seem willful.  




 I've had the opposite experience, all schizophrenics I know - realise eventually that their 'lies' are untrue.

Their lies never *feel* untrue though, and that's what rules their precepts / concepts.

But yeah, 'sociopathy' is a big umbrella (like schizophrenia too) - plenty of room for everyone almost. 




 Schizophrenia thrives on lies: those who lie to the schzoid, and the lies the schizoid tell themselves and others.

Understanding works both ways, and it's better with honesty (buffered by compassion always, but were past that in this thread) 




 As a non-bi guy, I'm not sure either.

You might have to settle for equal-opportunities combos for the day.

Now, where would you travel to for that?! :) 




 Hehehe :)

To be fair, no one should go anywhere near curtains.

They're costly to get right, almost nobody cares why you do get it right and the people who do care didn't pay for them most of the time.

Curtains are in that category of things that are only noticed when incorrect.

Sorry about the rant, stay Straight   Fabulous (encouraged, not trademarked) 




 Losing an uncle to suicide is awful

Though not awful enough for you to stop trolling it, so what's left:

Obvious Troll,

Bereavement-free Know-nothing, or

Bionic-Asshole 




 Replacing empathy with speculative assertions is not help, but you already know that don't you? 




 Fair enough, I've looked around and am very happy with the gay way I am.

Can't imagine swapping either, and I've been with a few women so perfectly ok going the rest of my life without being a sad-sack in their bed.

Are the memories bad? Nah, a fair few giggles though :) 




 Ohhh, new variation - make someone you fancy (pre-pill) take one too with you.  




 Only one way to know for sure 




 Curtains, don't cheap on the curtains if you can help it.

They take up more visual space than most furniture, spending money on curtains makes sense if you're sticking around for while.

Man, I want that 'straight' pill.  




 Do you think you're helping? 




 Is that a fact? If it is you better tell the Garda, or explain why you can't. 




 As someone who doesn't need such a pill, if I'd a 'Straight for a Day' pill - I'd take it and go to Florence. 




 Oh the science was annoying, but unlike Interstellar - Gravity didn't try to explain the bad science so I found it easier to ignore.

The Nitrogen thing in Interstellar, I had my disbelief unsuspended, and then a few times more - it made me forget I was watching a movie. 




 Ohh, Cake!

Cheers! 




 expects to get back every euro the Irish taxpayer put into the banks **since it came into office**

 




 If I posted this in /r/movies, I'd be shot.

I enjoyed Gravity more than Interstellar. They're both good movies, and Interstellar is great in places - it's also quite dull in places.

Gravity's just a thrill ride from start to finish, and both play loose with science.

 I think David Quinn is mixing up 'promote' with 'enforce', on purpose.

 Or how about this:

 If you've a spare Raspberry_Pi, you could install [RuneAudio](http://www.runeaudio.com/) on that as the music player and then use MPDroid as a remote on your phone to control it. 




 Awwww!

What's a 'super' subreddit mean? 




 Have you tried [MotionPie](https://github.com/ccrisan/motionPie#motionpie)  with the 'light detection' setting on?

Should cut down on the checking.

If you're happy to edit the motion.conf settings, you can limit the motion detection to certain sections of the image - reducing the false positives more:

Well, that was quick visit 









 Must have been cinema before then I guess. 




 I wonder what caused them before computer games? 




 The march is still on at the end of the month, isn't it!? 




 I pay the TV license, Netflix   Sky - I still download because national TV is largely nonsense and Sky ruin every decent show with adverts.

If Netflix had a decent range of shows   movies it would help, but as it is after ~2 months I'm done with everything on offer. I pay for it as a 'thank you' for shows like House of Cards.

Going to the cinema involves a car journey because we don't have cinemas in towns anymore.

If after all those services I pay for and the content that then entitles me to, someone is going to come after me for downloading, then I'll drop them and just download anyway - may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. 




 Ah of course, the single-payer potential of it will never see the light of day.  




 No, just providing reasons for a confidence problem. Have you been in A E recently, ever seen   heard what people on trolleys for hours looks like? It certainly isn't first world. 




 You read the bit where I questioned the 'confidence problem' of the quote? 




 There are two US health insurance companies in the country, like they're going to let the government do this - even if it was done right.

Mr Varadkar also insists that Ireland's health service is not "third world". He said such descriptions are because there is a "confidence problem" in the minds of the public.

The highest number of patients on trolleys only just a couple of weeks ago, a nurse's strike - all a confidence problem?


By the way, if you're with Liberty Insurance or Laya - you'll want to make your peace with the US government knowing your medical history and [checking it on entry into the US](https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1 uddg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fcanada%2Ftoronto%2Fcanadian-woman-refused-u-s-entry-because-of-depression-1.2444960) 




 Great to see the new commissioner enforce the rules like the last commissioner. 




 Rule #2: Install Linux, make it look like Windows - reap kudos. 




 Says the poster who provided none for the claim that started this thread.

Troll off child, or have some balls and try living outside Ireland and see how your crap fares. 




 Though the figures in the first chart are correct, spokesperson Ben Conroy described it as extremely selective in terms of what it choose to compare us with in terms of areas of interest

Ok, so where are their figures coming from? Is there an obvious data-set link I've missed?

 I heard about a system in Holland where if you're caught drunk-driving they confiscate the car   you've to buy it at a dutch-auction if you want it back.

We should try that. 














 You should post that to Sao Paolo, they're having a drought. 




 Should we leave the law to create two tiers of citizenship so Breda can feel better about her hypotheticals?

 When I lived in London, I met a few people who knew him, definitely on the prick side of the scale they reckoned. 




 I think he's just annoyed he'll have to buy an actual porn mag in a shop for a change.

 Follow Cameron down the E2E encrpytion-ban boys, it's not like this government hasn't followed idiots before.

Can't wait to see them square it with 'security' excuses as they watch every trade secret business go to the airport.

But sure it's the Dil, where else has the damage to this country of the last 10 years come from anyway.

I suppose Charlie has been calmed with 'assuarances' from external parities at this stage. 




 And the [Keymap Editor](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:Keymap_Editor) plugin for any other features of XBMC you want to map to the remote :) 




 I got off the Ubisoft hype-train at AC3, they're a bargin-bin only publisher for me now.

So whenever their games are 20 or less, I'll consider them, not before. 




 He applied, but the Gay Union said no - then nope then jesus no. 




 We should start using them to see how many Garda actually leave their stations during a shift. 




 Nah ;)

People didn't know if if was East European, Russian etc. 




 When he was first elected I remember it being part of the whole "and where's that surname from" questions   gossip floating around. There were even some photoshops of him, with his likeness shopped onto a super atheltic body (apparently a bit of a gym addict back then). 




 I'd like him to be a teacher. 




 Bit of an open secret wasn't it? 




 Very viable :)

I use a Pi as my main stereo, hidden away inside an old radio cabinet.

I use [Rune Audio](http://www.runeaudio.com/forum/) as MPD server, plus it comes with a nice UI for control from phones, tablets, pcs ...

Two things to note though:

The sound from the Pi is not great unless you add a DAC (it's really hissy without it) so I don't consider a DAC optional for this kind of setup. I went with a [Wolfson Audio DAC](http://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-accessories/wolfson_pi), it's designed for the Pi and Rune Audio has built-in settings for it.

The other thing is large collections. I had a much easier time after splittling my collection into folders of just less than 10,000 songs each. Scanning, and quick playback was much better then.

The sound is glorious   clear. And for the price, I reckon impossible to beat.
 




 User Kicked for Body-Swapping

Ban ~8 hours. 




 Which would be a great efficiency if secured correctly / legally barred from sharing with 3rd parties   barred from the commercialisation of data - yadda, yadda ...

What galls me is that while government wants more   finer grained data on citizens - the same government wants less   lower quality information known about it.

This is a pity as it would greatly assist citizens with sanctioning under-performers, removing government waste, evaluation and of course making informed decisions when voting.

I'll be happy to give the government more data, when I don't have to pull their teeth to get more information about them.

Until then, I'll give my votes to people less data-grabby. 




 If this is OS roulette, I'll put 10 down on SteamOS. 




 The data is:

to be held by the department and shared with other state agencies until the child is 30 years old

Yeah, that's not creepy or concerning at all.

I reckon they should pilot it on the children of Dil members, if the data hasn't leaked / been stolen by the end of this government - only then should they ask everyone else to do it. The Dil should probably check encrpytion standards while they're at it. 









 "Well love, was there any post?"

"No, but there's news" 









 He said the then regulator, Pat Neary, should have known Anglo was "bust" at the time of the guarantee.

I wonder what he will have to say for himself when his time comes to appear? 




  One must ask, why??

Because the Israeli Embassy in Ireland has a long history of inappropriate tweets and facebook posts which antagonise a lot of Irish people, and the embassy routinely has to delete the posts afterwards and apologise.

They've been doing this for years.

So I guess one must ask, why does Israel tolerate having these ambassadors represent them? 




 Amidst the noise of the storm: the rustling of papers, the click of keyboards and the swish of touchscreens - as thousands of Irish people check when their contract's up ... 




 Always Look on the Bright Side of Life ... 




 Yeah, that's fair.

I enjoyed it so much I've overlooked that its shorthand for things might gate it a bit.

You're right that it really shouldn't be the first on the reading list. 




 And the prohibtion on images of Mohammed is an Islamic prohibiton, if you're not a Muslim - it doesn't apply to you.

Should depictions of gay people   relationships remain hidden because gay relationships offend some religions? 

 




 And it's gone ... 




 I think out of any group, anywhere - there will always be those willing   wanting to go to extremes.

That only ~25 people have left Ireland to fight in Syria, or 0.07% of muslims in Ireland have done so - fits that idea.

It would be great that that tiny group didn't, but I don't think making policies for such outliers / edge cases is ever going to stop something which is part   parcel of human nature. However much we wish it weren't.

Plus, the very good news is that 99.93% do not.



 




 Coward 




 [2312](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2312_%28novel%29) is worth a look.

And for giggles with a serious point to make nonetheless, there's [Accelerando](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html) which the author re-released for free.

 




 When I lived in the city centre, two seagulls regularly flew onto the flat roof outside my window.

I called them Jim   Wanda, and fed them sometimes.

Very nice birds, clean unlike the pigeons, and never overstayed their welcome. Plus the pigeons were scared of them. 




  Charlie Hebdo cartoon that depicted a black French minister as a monkey

I guess you mean [this one](http://media.tumblr.com/22e6aeaf31bf5a075f35b89ea6e5c7bf/tumblr_inline_nhwpvoiCoN1r5ioaz.jpg) and I reckon you missed the point of it. 




 Sure all your sillys are brilliant, and the Snoos are your thing.

You've only to get permission from yourself. 




 Absolutely.

The prohibition on images of Muhammad is an Islamic one, this isn't an Islamic board and Ireland isn't an Islamic country.

The prohibition doesn't apply. 




 Didn't know there were more till your post.

I've played the Ellen Ripley (Last Survivor) DLC, it's good.

The opening will give you chills as it starts right at a really creepy part of the first film.

It is short though, which I guess is why there are no save points in it.

I thought it was worth it, but was expecting a little more. 









 Don't forget the U.N. they're biased too apparently.

how can a state that never existed be shrinking?

Is this wilful simplification? 




 Steam will get a big boost, showing off their steam machines and controllers over the year.

Console-only gamers will be very tempted to cross over after a mediocre and limited 2014, seeking the greater variety of games available via Steam, GOG etc.

Ubisoft will learn nothing, as they don't have to, their games sell anyway.

Though 2015 will probably be a bumper year for second-hand sales, as the lemons of 2014 get dumped into the stores by the end of this month.

By the end of 2015, Ubisoft will finally be in trouble for their QA issues after the Division sells next to no DLC. At least one of their divisions will be fully closed.

Nevertheless, 2015 will be much less salty. Adventure games will grow in popularity and books will become more of a primary source than movies. 




 NFS shares by hand at the command line, won't miss them. 




 Reporting back, it's like early web-design went to a metal gig, got confused and riffed out html.

Quite thrilling, in a 'sweet-jesus-what' kind of way. 









 I've been away from Netflix for a while till last week, and I couldn't get over the limited search   browsing.

One view   one search box (PS4 app) - dreadful.

I'll be keeping my Odroid with XBMC a while longer I think. 




 the speed just drops to 0 for about 60 seconds

This may seem random, but some microwave ovens interfere with Wifi - mine does, wifi is completely gone in its vicinity while it's on.

And 60 seconds must be one of the most common times for things in microwaves.

Is your microwave used a lot and / or near the router? 




 There's not much I can help you with there, sorry.

Though, just on the simple process side of things:

I had it enabled on both pi's but when adding sources there is nothing under the UPnP option.

There should be nothing at that point, not directory type lists or files.

For the 'just in case' , repeat the step till you get to that same point and then press 'left' on the remote or 'c' if you've a keyboard and if a dialog box appears then press 'enter' / 'ok' / 'select' / 'scan for content' or click your mouse.

I know it sounds simple, but it's how some of the menu actions work.

From a technical standpoint, what you're looking for is the norm for me and most of my friends - it's very doable.

Also, I use the 'quartz' skin - so if you haven't changed them yet, I'd swap over to that for the Pi, it's light   quick. 




 I reckon without Sky Sports, Sky themselves would have next to no customers. I know two people who only keep Sky for the golf. 

The other channels are a wasteland, or a dull echo of their previous selves, and the movies well there's netflix etc.  




 Well that's going to be a subreddit by the end of the day!

And dried cereals should be allowed to consort as they agree to themselves. 




 Were you able to connect to 'UPnP (Auto Discover)' using add sources?

It comes up when you choose UPnP at the add sources stage but don't choose anything after - just it, and then it will be listed as a source. Click on that and any UPnP will show up, you should be able to connect from there. Both R-Pi's will need the 'connect via UPnP' and similar options ticked, of course.

Anyway, that's only one method. Plus UPnP won't get you posters, plotlines and other metadata - network shares will.

The better methods would be using SAMBA or NFS network shares. First way to do that is possibly your home router, if it's reasonably new it should have a NAS or 'File Sharing' option. Enable that on the router, plug the hard-drive into it and then back to your Pi. This time you'll be adding sources via the 'Windows Network (Samba)' or 'Network Share (NFS)' option and if the router's done it's job, you'll find all your folders in there and select them as you would in the same way as if it was a connected hard-drive.

If the router can't help you there, then you'd need a home-server. So that's typically an unused PC / laptop, or something like the Pi (though usually not super fast enough) or Odroid U3, it's not a massive piece of work - but a bit longer than a reddit comment. There are loads of guides online, but the quickest solution is with your router if it has such a function. So try that first. 




 I got Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments with my Christmas vouchers, if you like puzzle games it's a good one - though not a MENSA level challenge.

You can even end up solving the cases wrong if you're not too attentive. It's about 10 - 14 hours, felt like value to me for the price.

It looks great too, though there can be a lot of loading screens.
