 Well, they still have 7 days to fulfill their promise. 




 AliExpress takes like 2-3 weeks to get to you.

 You get a Spencer Lanning jersey. 




 I made it to the WSG to the backers once.  There were like 100 people there. I live in Snohomish County. Let's start one there ;) 




 Totally. 




 Steelers and Stealers, indeed. 




 I am not buying a new style jersey until they make one with a 5 on it. Fucking Spencer Lanning. 




 Do you think they would stay on to coach? Starting as an intern on Special Teams and working to create a true culture of veterans, rookies and alumni working together to coach, lead, and play the Browns into a perennial winner? I hate to say anything ever about the Stealers, but Ozzy Newsome is amazing, and he is amazing because of his love not only for the game, but the organization he works for. They win because everyone still works together to make things happen. From the newest guy, to the most seasoned HoF-er, they still work with the team and add their energy to make it strong. I would love for either Joe to become a coach and stay on with us.  




 I really hope we get people like Ike Taylor retiring from our team. His article on BR about his outlook on moving into the next arena of football (coaching) is inspiring. "I never wanted to be anywhere else. Yes I'm retiring, but that doesn't mean I'm done. My next job for the Steelers can be without cleats. In an office. I can start at the bottom and work my way up. Just being here to help these guys become great is what I live for. Seeing my guys go from 4-5-6 on the depth chart to 1-2-3 is an amazing feeling. Do you need something? I'm the guy. Can I run to Walmart and grab it before the game? I'm 
 that kind of person" 

It's that love for his team, and the desire to be part of what makes it great, that has melted the black and yellow when I see him, and reveals the kind of player I want on the Browns. 

Here's hoping that the culture within First Energy has sweetened and tightened up enough that we begin breeding players with this outlook at the end of their careers.

 They look a lot like the 1946 jersey numbers.  




 Have they given designations to the new colors? We used to be Seal Brown, Pumpkin, and White. I know we have a pantone number for the orange that was referenced in an earlier thread, but do we know if they plan on naming them?  




 Oh my gods and goddeses and all that is holy and unholy and may get you to stop;  Stop. Just stop it. S. T. O. P. For the ever love of shutting the hell up.  




 I love them all,  so we will go with base 8 on all of them,  with the all white and all brown being 10's love them. The complimentary stitching is so sick, and the carbon fiber brown stripe on the helmet is stylish A.F.  




 I love them. F$^ #*g love them. The White on White is sick. The drop Shadow is a throwback to the pre-NFL days. Cleveland on the Chest is cool. Browns up the legs is cool. I love the juxtaposition (seems to be the word of the City right now) of old and new is there, and beautiful, and I can get behind my team looking this way. Brutal. And the minimal change to the Helmet was masterfully done. Classy, and Edgy. I'm sold. 




 Could it be possible that it has more ability to break up the color of the ball, so that it is more in line with the jersey color rule? 




 I like the Orange numbers on Brown. I really do. 




 Brown with orange numbers is awesome.  




 That's a stupid rule.  




 Beer is more expensive out here in WA. I spent the same amount of money, but I included 2 really nice 22oz bombers that were pricey, but DELICIOUS! 




 I got a wonderful box of NE Ohio love. Inside of my package were a lineup that I had to put my [Fortuna Gratis statue in the middle](http://imgur.com/gO1mdIa) of to show how lucky I was!

There was also a Thirsty Dog Brewing Irish Setter Red, and an All For one Session IPA.

But flanking the Goddess, Herself, [are the two cans of Bernie Beer](http://imgur.com/vUozM3e), because obviously my man knew I would want to keep one unopened, and would also have to taste its Kosar-ie contents. Great trade! Thanks again /u/ohheyeverybody I hope you like what you have coming! 









 I am so ready. I have some great drafts in my fridge as we speak. I have such good beer in WA. Thanks for putting this together Pabsty. 




 I would replaced the blue with Brown. Because we're the Browns. Edit: Nothing personal.  Hate the Idea of adding grey.

 I'm a big fan of them both. I think that Crowell will be our goal line RB because he can always find 2 yards, where T-West will have more overall yards, because when he does break one off, He. Takes. Off.
 




 786yds, 9 rushTDs/2 receiving TDs. I see him as a goal line guy.

T West will have more yards, but less TD's. Prolly 950yds 4Rush TDs, 1 receiving TD. 




 All I know is a random Pro Football Focus article says that it happened, and all of the sudden it's everywhere as fact. I just want a link to someone in a front office saying that wither they the Browns, or they the other team offered or was offered this pick for that QB. I cant find it and would love it if someone could confirm or dent the existence of such an article.

 Ha Ha! Only someone who didn't do their homework could come up with an article as far off base as this one is. No research!

#1 Johnny's parents are extremely glad that he was drafted by the Browns. Not only has he gotten the help he needed but the Browns have set up a support system to surround him upon his release. Jimmy   Dee Haslam are oil people   so are Johnny's parents, they are friends that have a lot in common. The Haslam's are looking out for Johnny's best interest   the quote that backs this up is Coach Pet saying that, JM the person is the first thing that needs addressed. Imagine that, an organization that actually cares for the health   welfare of their employees. Not to mention that Coach Pet has taken time to go visit him. Being there for him   not turning his back on him in his time of need   surely the HC   QB are going to become close after this.

#2 Going through rehab myself I know what the things are needed upon his release   first   foremost is a great support system. The Browns have done that in both areas, work   personally. 1.They assemble an offensive coaching staff with the ability to transform these college spread QB's into the NFL. This is proved by each coach's history of developing QB's. Coach Flip called his offensive staff an all-star staff as his phone was ringing off the wall during the period he was doing coaching candidate interviews. Do your research like I have   you will see this, just read negative articles written by others that don't understand what is going on   we get articles like this. Whoever is the Browns QB is going to come to us from college   if you have the ability to transform a college spread QB into the NFL you will have a bigger selection to choose from as most college QB's are spread QB's   this won't change anytime soon so the NFL better learn real quick on how to coach them or they will have a T-shirt with 20 some QB's listed on it as well. This basically is a cutting edge staff put together with a whole lot of thought. Each area in a QB's development has a specialist that will work with him in that area. Plumber's do the plumbing, electricians do the electric, labor's do the grunt work etc etc. They have JM covered in all areas pertaining to football. They even have come up with a 24/7 plan for his week. How he will spend his time off the field as well.

The next part of the support system is a sponsor, someone he can call when he feels like he could relapse. Someone who cares   has his best interest at heart. Someone he can relate to   tell his deepest darkest secrets. The sponser is never a partner in crime, not one of his party buddy's would qualify as they weren't really friends, but friends just wanting something from him. Enter Josh McCown for a 3 fold purpose. He has the ability to be the bridge QB temporarily on the field, the desire to go into coaching when he lays the ball down is a plus for him as he is getting on the job training so to speak that is going help him when he does retire. If you heard Josh's comments about his desire to work with Johnny   when it's time for him to turn the ball over to Johnny or another QB he won't have a problem doing that. His own ego being put to the side for the best of others comes right out of the Bible. He is an example for Manziel on how he needs to feel. The perfect sponsor for Johnny is what Josh is. Not only that, but their home towns are only about 30 miles a part, they can relate in more areas then one   those jet ride homes with party boys will now be filled with the McCown family rather then his bling family. This goes deep sports fans   well thought out by a team that actually does care for not only his well being but others as well. Take note Josh Gordon if you are reading this. Johnny is leading you   providing an example for your good as well. Listen to his play call as once Johnny has gone through it, his next step in rehab is to sponsor others   help them get through it. The whole situation is looking good   the Browns are trying their hardest to be a team that can handle any type player. Whether they be on the wild side or the goody 2 shoes side, they will now be able to not be guided by fear in the draft, but rather could develop players like Dorial Green Beckham. Fear has lowered his draft stock   the Browns could benefit from that like the Bengals did with Vontaze Burfict who fell completely out of the draft because of the fear associated with him. The Bengals had a mentor for him in place that got his attention. That is what separates the AFCN from other divisions, they actually care about their players   don't care what ill informed writers have to say.

As far as surrounding him with receivers, that is not the first thing you do when building a team. When building a team you start with a plan. The Franchise QB has strength's   weaknesses that can become strength's with the right coaching in it's due time. But once a QB or your idea of a QB is established then you can draft according to their strengths. As the QB grows you may have to tweak your style   New England is a perfect example of this as their offense changes pretty regular. The OL is the most important area to support your franchise QB   the Browns have that, may need tweaked but the core is place. Then the running game follows,   the WR's after that, drafted or traded for or a FA, basically they can come from anywhere.

For Pete's sake this is only March   we won't know who is destined to come to the Browns until September, then we won't know how successful they were until the end of the season. Some of us can look at that vacant lot   envision the mansion on the hill. Then again, some can't   that results in articles like this guy wrote!

Meet Johnny's sponsor here! QB, Josh McCown, "My Heart is to Please God" Don't forget, Johnny is in a faith based rehab program.

 That would be "sir", but I appreciate it none the less. [Edit: Dusty Dionne is my legal full name]

 [The Witchy Council of Super Friends Does Not Speak For Me](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=342256635970157) 




 So, I will tell you what I told a good friend: *"If the bill goes through, this will be part of what we will be coaching Wiccans to accept as part of their rights, and then we will start dealing with winning the court cases, and that will cement our rights. Change can be made, and if they give us a framework of law that they think is going to give them exclusive religious rights, then what we are going to do is set our beliefs into that framework, and we legally should have the same expansion of our rights.* **[EDIT: Forgot this part and it posted without me getting it put in:]** *Wicca has full government recognition because of the umbrella 501(c)3 that the ATC holds. What the ATC is doing, and does, is inform the legislature and our members of what Wiccan rights will be under their new proposed law changes. It is outside of the scope of the ATC's 501(c)3 to try to create new legislature or endorse or denounce existing legislature"* 




 Thank you. I wrote every, single, senator in Georgia and shared the original link to the [original article](http://www.panegyria.com/news/the-aquarian-tabernacle-church-outlines-wiccas-new-rights-under-the-georgia-religious-freedom-restoration-act). Makes sense for them to all know what rights to expect. Thanks again for the suggestion. Took me all day. 




 The ATC is pointing out where the new rights will expand into Wiccan territory. If the Government passes the bill, then new rights open up. Including rights surrounding marriage, taxes, and worship. Much like what the Christian Right thought would happen with allowing prayer in Louisiana public schools. They didn't realize other religions would have new expanded rights under the law allowing them to host public prayer, as well. 




 Totally a troll tactic. The link back was correct.

 SB 129? I am in total agreement. 









 Well.... his arm is strong enough that when he throws it as hard as he can he knocks himself on his butt. I guess that's positive, kinda. 




 I called him a "Ding Dong" on twitter. I could have been nicer, but I don't think he deserves it. 




 Eeeeyyyeeeeaaahhhhhh...... We don't trade picks like that. Farmer has been nothing put a draft pick wizard in his one appearance pre season. [Still not convinced the 6th and 22nd pick were his ideas, even though he swears they were] 




 Farmer would never hook anyone up with a first round pick for someone with an injury track record like Bradford.

 I love that people have downvoted this. Here, I'll be the person! "Let it go, man. You're making us look like a bunch of babies. When we start winning maybe we can have an opinion. He's dead, let it go. Stop having the rivalries that make us proud to be Browns fans, already. WTF." How'd I do?

 You seem to be under the notion that they don't throw MORE OFTEN to Skrine so as not to throw it at Haden.  




 Thank you. I was in no way going to remove the possible piece of history, myself. I am going to take it to the Seattle Museum of Art, or the U. of WA. Thank you for the heads up. 




 How would one tell? 




 We run a non-Abrahamic denomination, church. We have just had our founder die, and the torch has passed. We were cleaning the church after he passed, and found this framed picture wrapped in a blanket in the back, often locked, closet in the bathroom. After showing it to our archivist, she came to the conclusion that it was real pencil and real watercolor, and the "foxing" on the paper would denote that it would be from around the 40's or 50's. Her next suggestion was to take it to the University of Washington. I brought it here, first.

 Tearing up Harrison (Harris-ment), which is even more awesome. 




 I appreciate the info! He looked like his work ethic and his in the locker room personality were above board. He spent the combine working out, and he talked about how important it is to be friends with the team and the coaches. Gratzi, again! 









 As much as I would like to think he will come back all better, as someone who came off of rehab with a girlfriend still using, it broke us up. If it hadn't, I wouldn't have stayed sober. It was one of the hardest decisions of my life. Since his drugs of choice are alcohol and social media, it would seem like his GF isnt going to do him any favors, unfortunately. 




  Pantone 2028 C

There we go. So then my next question: Who makes the official named designation of these colors? Such as 'Seal' Brown and 'Burnt' Orange? And do they have the plan to name this new orange, as well? 




 Huzzah  




 No.  It's iconic for classic football.  




 Do you know why that's considered 'a stock helmet picture? Because we made it iconic. The stock photos  are  copying us.  




 That's awesome.  




 I don't know if you're correct, but I like it. 




 Burnt Orange and Seal Brown were the old guard. What is the technical new designation of this vibrant, new, orange? 




 It should show people how important a decision this is based solely on how much this has encompassed all of football. It's the Yankees changing to polka dots. It's gonna be weird. Does that mean 'bad'? No. 'Change' and 'Pain' exist in the same region of the human brain. It's gonna be different, but that doesn't mean bad. 




 Thank you!  




 You are absolutely correct. Even our own solar system is actually moving in a three dimensional spiral, but that is a much more in depth conversation.  Good call, though.  




 So let me understand this. [The Cavaliers use a 'C']( https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/542030215027781632/BrO34cMY.png) and [The Indians us a 'C']( http://content.sportslogos.net/logos/53/57/full/006wvt6wf3g02vqhx7yofazqv.gif) and now The Browns? Fuck copying the Bears, we are copying ourselves copying ourselves with that one. [No sir, I dont like it.]( http://www.meh.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/meh.ro6390.jpg) 




 It's one of the best things about the medium of online text, in my opinion. Since there is no inflection of tone, and no distinctiveness in ones handwriting on the web, it stands to reason to find the best way to do that within the medium. [For example: On reddit it would have looked like this](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/double-take.gif)
 




 ALSO, it is an imaginary equator that runs through the galaxy, much like there is an imaginary line through the middle of an Astrological Natal Chart. Our sun turns around the center of our galaxy the same as the Earth turns around the sun, and a person could map that two dimensionally on a piece of paper as a circle with 12 pie segments. Our earth moves through 3 segments every season in a circle, eventually coming back to a starting point. In the western world, we consider this January 1st. The same exists on a macrocosmic level for the galaxy. Only instead of it taking 30 days per segment, it takes 2100-2600 years. And instead of calling it a 'month' we call it an 'age'. [I'm sure there is a leap epoch in there to make up for the math.](http://media.giphy.com/media/10yeJtpwWcFrAA/giphy.gif) 




 [Our sun moves around the enter of the Milky Way much like our planet moves around our sun. Like in this picture.](http://en.es-static.us/upl/2011/01/Milky_Way_face-on_edge-on-e1342743292482.jpeg) We move through ages (Like the Dawning of the Age of Aquarius) every 2100 years or so. Aquarius is the beginning of spring in the Astrological sense. *Edit: I have changed the article to reflect that I am speaking of the Galaxy, not the Universe.
