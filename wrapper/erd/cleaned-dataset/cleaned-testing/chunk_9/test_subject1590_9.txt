 thanks for the info! 




 Let's be objective even if you are not a Christian. I am not one either but have great respect for Pope Francis. 




 Couldn't agree more. 




 I wish they have it available at the west end of st. george as well. 




 My personal preference is the east asian library (on the 8th floor of Robarts). I liked books there and also few people use that library. For most people (that are non-east asian, so to say), they find the trinity library has pretty good scenery, so that's a place to check out. 




 Is it true that if bears attack you, you do the same? 




 Not my program so I can't offer anything specific (academically).

Use the library system wisely - UofT has a lot of books, and I had a lot of fun, when I was there as  grad student, reading stuff not from my subject. It's great learning and free too! 




 What do you study here? 




 Highly sophisticated AIs that can do a lot of things like housework, driving, etc. 




 I don't know, maybe the stakes matter more than whether you are online or offline. People tend to focus less for online games because those are just entertainment really, but when you play in person you are most likely competing for something and so people play more seriously (and hence harder). 




 Really? When did del Piero say he is gunna return? 




 I don't think it's true. Marotta said the transfer season is done already. 




 Very well said. Not a bad player at all, just not a world class one. 
























 I have a friend who really really like this game, so I guess yeah, they have some loyal fans too.

 




 Wow, thanks so much! 




 yeah, shut up is the best words to him. 




 That's good to hear. Will definitely try it out before the end of summer. 




 But Olympics are slightly different right? FIFA WC is played in a number of cities, and for a country like Germany, they have many high end stadiums for their league games already, so that's not a problem at all. But for Olympics, it's all in one city and there are a lot of different sports (so a lot more stadiums are needed in a more concentrated area). Does that make a difference? 




 Cities Skyline, is that really good? I heard some good things about it but haven't had a chance to play yet. 




 Yeah, I don't know many of the games on the list personally either, actually. Basically I only played The Witcher 3 and Pillars of Eternity.  




 Yeah, Pillars of Eternity is also good, needless to say. But yeah, Witcher 3 is just another level. 




 I definitely think The Witcher 3 is the best game this year. Anyone agree/disagree? 














 Thanks, do you know if there are sample code for this? e.g. on R-blogger? 




 Oh, right. Thanks. 









 Who is Ron again? 




 I see, didn't known Trapp is joining. 




 I think people, in general, tend to underestimate historical players and the underestimation will grow with time. I am not saying that people are underestimating Pele necessarily, I have never seem Pele play so hard for me to comment, but just making the comment as a general observation. 




 This is not really a surprise because there are so many teams competing for a WC spot. 




 So if Roma gets Sirigu, who is PSG going to get as their startig keeper? 



















 Wow, that's a lot of names you've listed. 




 I guess it's all about the branding. They have such a group loyal consumers that would by anything Apple makes, so why not just set the price high? 









 What's happening to this world ??? 
























 ahhh, I must be mixing things up. 




 But Daryl is so strong and is such a capable survivor, why him? 




 Anyone think Glen will die next season? 









 Haha, that's a sad story.

 Nobody can tell you meaningful things here mostly (because everyone here is in your shoes basically). Talk with advisors   investors and get some ideas from them. All you need is talk to a few and if they are really impressed, they will introduce you to you.

Try reaching out to advisor to start, these people are more willing to see you than investors. Find them on angel.co 




 That's not true, headbutting is his trademark move :) 




 Seedorf also had a great long range goal playing for Real Madrid I think, just like this one. 


































 Raul will be remembered more for his contributions to Real Madrid, whereas his contributions to the National Team is less. But still, I think in Spain, he will be better remembered (i.e. his overall contribution to club   national team is greater than that of Villa).

Raul is kind of like del Piero in some sense, both achieved great things for their respective clubs, but not as much at the national level.
