 Basically, I am coming up with a name for a waste management related project, and I am looking for words to use in the name that present the topic in a refreshing and rejuvenating manner, rather than giving off the immediate impression of filth. Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks! 




 Thank you, very informative. I was going to ask how you got there from Cartagena but you've covered it.
