This is a previous question from subreddit vegas.  It is a full-day round trip to Death Valley going west - and it's a great day trip.  I like Zion too - going east - about 3.5 hr drive but less than the Grand Canyon.  Maybe Mt. Charleston - only about 1/2 hr, but not a lot to do once you get there. 




 It will only go away if enough people want it to.  You try working for a living at 80. 




 That is funny.  Thanks for sharing. 




 I think I would have helped my sister though. 




 I think I love bridges. 




 I'm with you. 




 You sound just like a republican. 




 I'm grateful that I learned to type in high school.   




 I say this all the time in Reddit, but the Republican Party is 90% white, and Romney's vote was 96% white.  This ought to tell you all that is needed to know.  Source:  Dog Whistle Politics. 




 








I remember seeing George Soros on tv prior to GW Bush second campaign saying if he wins, something is wrong with us.  He's right, something is wrong with us.




 




 And I believe Nixon negotiated with the Vietnamese prior to his election, also treasonous.

 Yum. 




 I really enjoy Michael Palin's travel shows - he doesn't do a lot of them, but the ones he has done have been really good.  You probably can view some on them on line by googling his name. 




 One of my favorite life stories:  We had a welfare rights march in our town in the 70's.  There was another group who organized an anti-welfare march.  A year or so later I was at our local legal services office as a volunteer and I recognized the leader of the anti-welfare march at the office.  He had experienced a heart attack, lost his job, then his wife and his home.  He had no health care, and was seeking legal services.  His life had literally fallen apart.  I remember speaking with him and he regretted the role he had played when fighting these "welfare mothers". 




 A couple of points:  I do not believe it is a ponzi scheme; Ponzi schemes run out of investors eventually.  Social security will not; benefits would be reduced first.  It is NECESSARY unless you want to support your parents late in life when they are not able to work.  Finally, I wished I had taken a video of my republican congressman also who also called it a Ponzi scheme at a town meeting.  Republicans don't really want to get rid of social security - they just want to get their greedy hands on it. 




 I agree.  It sucks. 




 It will hurt when you are too old to work and your social security will not cover any of your living expenses,  And yes, it will be there. 




 Well, tell us more.  




 They have the majority vote. 




 The above post is a repost, but thought it would be interesting to LV redditors. 









 Not really.  I saw them test the spillways one year letting more water through the dam than they ever had.  It was great.  That being said, scientists now say that there is a 50-50 chance that the river will dry up in the next 20 yrs.  http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/02/080213-AP-lake-mead.html 




 I recently went to a conference with a friend (out of LV).  She lost her wallet TWICE before we landed at our destination.  They paged her the first time and she got it back.  We boarded and she left her wallet again(!) on the plane.  This time it when on to another destination! The airlines mailed it to her at our hotel so she did get it back before we left town, but most of the money was gone.  She did her ID back though. 




 I appreciate the chart.  I am old and still want some type of entrepreneurship project.  I still am working 40 hrs/week, but want to give it one last go.  Just haven't found the project I want to throw myself in to. (I did help create a few great nonprofits when I was younger though).  Also, I want a partner to review things with, share responsibility.  I've been looking for a good partner to conspire with, and everyone seems to be too busy doing their own thing.  I'm not giving up however! 




 I met a woman at Wal-Mart one day who told me she credited the elllipitcal with her 200 lb weight loss. 



















 I loved that movie. 




 Thank you. 




 I don't remember when it happened, but a baby was identified as being the next Dalai Lama, but was kidnapped by the Chinese. 









 I learned in school that southern California climate was like the Mediteranian. 




 Thank you. 




 Isn't it insane?  Unions are not perfect, but they really did help the workers are different times in our history.  We have a lot of trolls on reddit too. 














 Different people have different needs.  I think it would be more work and more expensive to break it down into different categories.  And in the end, does it matter? 









 Yeah, free speech.  I just read about another big donor from Nevada who makes his money on student loans.  What sleezeballs. 




 Teachers are unionized, and probably one of the largest unions in the US.   Unions are probably one of the biggest contributors to democrats also.  Kill the unions, kill the Democratic Party.  It's political. Too add to this, teachers are highly educated and for many years were underpaid.  They learned that they could lift their standard of living by working together, unionizing.  And they have done better that they did before they were unionized. 




 I'm assuming when the term welfare is used in this discussion, that it includes welfare and food stamps.  Remember that welfare is time limited - maximium 5 years in the US from the welfare reform law passed  during the Clinton administration.  Most welfare recipients are young single mothers, and if not working, are required to attend vocational training or volunteer 20-30 hrs/week.  2-parent households are required to meet a 35 hr/week requirement.  Those unable to work must have a doctor's statements. 




 Part E - for Everybody. 




 I would prefer the GNP:

 Soros goals are for an open and democratic society (see his foundation).  What are this guy's goals? 




 Just look at the denial in these comments! 




 If they would only stop and think. 




 I work with TANF clients, and I bet most of the cash money (which isn't much) either goes for diapers or towards rent. 









 My husband's uncle said the same thing 50 years ago.  My husband is receiving social security today - and we bless FDR. 




 That's absurd. 




 I went to the Netroots Convention this year in Detroit, and yes, I think it is a beautiful city.  I was given a short tour of the city, but missed these lobbies.  Unbelievably beautiful.  The city has been threatening to turn off water to 40% of the city's residents however since they have been unable to pay their bills.  Unemployment is high since GM left.  Corporations have no moral values.  They can pick up and leave a mess - and nothing anybody can do about it. 




 I don't remember any impeachment proceedings against Bush.  i remember Pelosi saying she just wanted to move forward. 




 Like Bush didn't??? 




 Well, they spent millions trying to get Bill Clinton.  What's new except these guys don't know how to legislate. 




 I've been wanting to read the book.  A later UW team was also amazing.  My uncle was part of the junior varsity rowing team from UW in 1948.  It is an interesting story too that I only learned about after reading about it online at UW.  The varsity team couldn't go to the Olympics (i don't remember why), and the JV team took their place.  They were not expected to do well, but won the Gold.  My cousins took me to a bar at Northgate shopping center last year to show me a full wall mural of the team! 




 No, we just need to set priorities. 




 No, it is not a ponzi scheme.  Ponzi scheme runs out when there are no more investors.  As long as people continue to pay in to the system, there can always be social security.  Also, they can raise the rates or cut benefits a small amount, but people will continue to be paid.  Also, think about supporting your parents when they are old and unable to work.  Isn't it better that they can remain self-sufficient in their old age?  And how will you feel at that age?   Ready to work until you drop? 




 Tax em 80% for keeping it there. 




 Right. I mean 96% of Romney's vote came from white people. 




 I would love to see a reddit map of precincts, and recruit reddit captains for each precinct.  That might be a project worth working on!  Move-on had a great project one year (not sure why they didn't continue it), but I was able to download every voter in my precinct and contact them either by phone or in person.  I am biased and support democrats (at least good ones).  It would be cool to target democrats in republican districts and see if is possible to flip the district.   Also, I noted on a previous comment that I would target medicaid-eligible people also who are unable to sign up for medicaid as their state did not accept medicaid expansion (21 states?).  These people could seriously benefit from voting in their self-interest. 




 I would recruit all those people who are being denied medicaid because their states refused to expand medicaid under ACA.  (21 states?)  They really have something to gain from voting at the state level. 




 I'm not so sure.  Vegas was not built with buses in mind.  It might take you two hours to get to work. 




 No, I bet if you look deeper, there are contracts going to cronys. 




 They also have all of the income. 




 Still, 12 of 466 is pretty small. 




 But those guys were fighting the federal government; these protesters are not.   




 Eric Holder is going this week, probably sent by Obama. 




 They just don't play by the rules - at least since the 70's and maybe before then.  Also, they have more money than they need legitimately, so they start looking at other things to fund. 




 What a Wonderful World. 




 I have some lamps that do that too, and I was looking for replacements and didn't know what to call them either! 




 I met someone once with that name also. 




 I used to wonder about the contradiction, but you now hear them referring to innocent life.   




 If we had supported states' rights as a nation, we would still have slavery. 




 That's enough to put a chill down my spine. 




 Democrats have a lot of libertarian values, more than republicans, I believe.  We support all of the issues you listed. 




 I think your comment is the first one I've ever saved.  Thank you for sharing. 




 Local governments target them.  That's one of the arguments about having a strong central government that support minority rights.   




 Whew! 




 I would rather live in pain and depression for my entire life than to see the grief and pain suffered by my mother on the loss of her son. 




 Mine too. 




 Not 96% which is the white percentage of vote that Romney received. 




 By design I believe. 




 9   1/2 Weeks. I loved the movie, so I thought I would read the book. Just awful and there was no resemblance between the movie and the book. 




 I used their paint for years and was shocked at the sales price last time I was there. I think it was $60 on sale.  I like the paint at Walmart just the same now. 




 Conspiracies do happen!  I can't address your questions, but I heard a recorded phone call on an old tv show (Investigative Reports I believe) that wowed me - where one mob person told another that the hit was on for JFK.  I was also convinced by Thom Hartmann's book - http://www.amazon.com/Legacy-Secrecy-Long-Shadow-Assassination/dp/1582435359
By the way, I think I found the Investigative Report show also that covered it:  http://www.amazon.com/Investigative-Reports-Jack-Anderson-JFK/dp/B000FKP0TG
A lot of responsible people have said they don't  believe it was a conspiracy, but it would be hard to convince me otherwise. 




 We can't pay for education, but we want to have an arena?? 




 Most people don't watch what is going on.  I meet people all the time who just don't have a clue. 




 Try La-Z-Boy swival glider. 




 I think this was the most recognized of any National Geographic covers. 




 You're right.  I used to call it black and white channel because of all the World War II shows.  I think Fox bought it, and now we get stuff not even related to history! 




 They said they wouldn't do it until they did it. 




 The southern strategy?  Lee Atwater spoke publically about about using the southern strategy in 1981.  I believe that Ken Mehlman also apologized for it.  You can believe what you want, but I think it has been pretty much accepted for fact.  And the idea of a small government.  We fought a war over "states' rights", and the confedercy lost.  The original Articles of Confederation failed also.  Good try, but you can't convince me on either topic. 




 Or those that make money off the 10%. 




 He's not.  I've known him for decades. 




 Good job!
 




 Some, but most tea baggers are older than this.  Most of the Woodstock generation fought against the war in Viet Nam, fought for civil rights  and did some good things.  We are still fighting. 




 Ferris Bueller's Day Off;  Naked Gun. 




 Democrats are not perfect, but they are not crazy. I read that on a bumper sticker and it's correct as far as I can tell. 




 Democrats need to hold their own districts and win on republican districts. It could happen if all those people not covered by Medicaid in republican districts voted! 




 Democrats need to hold their own districts and win on republican districts. 




 90% white. 




 This has probablly been posted on reddit previously, but I still check it out.  Scares me too:  http://www.upworthy.com/a-smartypants-scientist-makes-an-easy-analogy-about-our-planet-and-now-im-scared 




 Sunset Park has a mile path around it's pond (and I think over 7 miles of paths).  It's at Eastern and Sunset. Road.  People do run there. 




 It doesn't matter what links I could put forth - we see the world from two different frames.  I know that you know that democrats became republicans after Jim Crow - part of the well-known southern strategy.  And I personally believe that voter ID laws are an attempt to restrict minority voting.  And there are a lot of people who believe this or the republican party would not be 90% white, or that Romney would get more than 4% of the minority vote.  
The whole concept of limited government is bizarre to me.  It is my belief that the Articles of Confederation failed because they didn't give the federal government enough power to function.  We also fought a civil war over states rights, and the South lost!  Can't we just let the issue die and get on with it??!!!  Sorry about the 18 day response - I don't check this area of reddit frequently enough...I do appreciate your response though. 




 Yes, and Republicans said they woudn't shut down the government either. 




 I have a friend whose in his 60's and has done that his entire life.  His longest job was was doing newspaper delivery as a teenager.  He is fortunate to have a career in which he can do this, but his social security is small and he will never have a stressless retirement. 




 I didn't watch the video, but read the article.  These guys make false claims, then walk away.  I would go berserk in their presence also. 




 Less hypocracy. 




 If the member services will not tell you, call a social worker at the welfare office.  They know which health plans cover which mental health services (and providers). 




 When they were talking about taxing the rich, I wanted to call it the Walton tax too. 




 Maybe Matt Tiiabbi.  I love reading him, ah, the irreverence! 









 My grandparents loved Lawrence Welk too.  I can't believe they stilll play his shows! 




 No, but continuing resolutions were ongoing for many years.  They should do budgets, but it's always been a difficult process. 




 Here's a Pew study.
http://www.pewforum.org/2011/02/23/tea-party-and-religion/
I could probably write a term paper on women's rights and voting, but I'm lazy.  Just googled and found articles on each:
http://www.thenation.com/article/176781/jim-crow-ii (voting rights)
http://www.pfaw.org/media-center/publications/gop-takes-its-war-women-states (women) 




 I've been wondering if we would have another civil war.  Things can get so ugly. 




 It's pretty clear what drives them. 




 Several things:  To lose weight, I have to cut way back and exercise.  I lose weight and need to cut my calories again to lose more weight.  I don't think I can cut them any farther!  I also have a history of yo-yo dieting.  I always end up weighing more than before I started!  I think if I would have worked out more when I was young and never dieted, I wouldn't weigh what I do today.  I don't know if that makes sense, but that is how I feel.  It is also a lot of work and takes more time than I want to spend on the topic.  I do know I would feel better though. 









 I am reading a book called the Zero Maginal Cost Society about how many of the basics - power, education and some other major items will be so cheap to produce, that they will be near free.  It will take major battles to get there, but he convinced me.
http://www.thezeromarginalcostsociety.com
 




 I am reading Zero Marginal Cost Society - http://www.thezeromarginalcostsociety.com/
about a new collaborative age where basics - including energy, education, etc. will almost be free - because the cost to produce it will be so low.  There will be some battles to get there, but he made his point to me. 




 Depending upon your area of study, you might be able to get a year or more written off by working in a low-income community.  




 Marvin Gaye had it right:  Sexual Healing. 




 They need to be shamed in to doing the right thing, and Cuban seems to be doing that. Good for him! Fortune magazine had a  article recently about the same topic.
 http://fortune.com/2014/07/07/taxes-offshore-dodge/ I read some of the comments.  One woman thinks they are moving companies to areas for low labor costs.  No, they are moving their corporate headquarters to counties like Switzerland to specifically avoid American taxes.  They probably have a better standard of living there. 




 Nice job! 




 I spent summers there as a kid.  It sure looks different today. 




 Eve of Distruction. 




 Why do fiscal conservatives vote republican anyway?  They say they are fiscally sound, but if you look at it historically, they are not.  They spend it different ways - mostly for military, and usually end up with a lot of ripoffs due to deregulation.  Reagan is a prime example. Cut taxes, expand the military, deregulate (which killed Savings and Loans and created a huge ripoff of HUD which cost billions.))  Democrats at least have a plan for pay for what they spend and try to monitor spending.  They also realize that peoples rising boat lifts the whole society. 




 We may all sink with that view. 




 I knew someone like that 20 yrs ago who had clients who would pay him - and he was respected in the field! I would hear him on radio shows talking as an expert.  But he was just a fast-talker - just like you are writing about.  I knew his wife.  Not sure if he is around today.  I think the only license you would need is a straight business license (but I'm not an expert).  UNLV offered a class one semester on handicapping and I made my husband go - it caused a stir (not sure I remember why), and they never offered the class again.  That being said, there is probably room for a smart handicapper.  The ones that publish in the paper have always sucked.  The really good handicappers work for the sportsbooks setting odds in the first place. 




 It's true.  Look back at Republican administrations.  Most broke the bank; then dems have to come in and straighten it out.  They just spend it on different things. 




 Reid won't bring up issues that can't pass.  He is a vote counter and knows exactly what the vote will be before he brings it to the floor.  And remember, he needs 60 votes on most issues.  There is a difference.  He didn't decide on Obama's inauguration day to fight republicans on every issue.  And quit calling people morons.  Does not lead to a good discussion. 




 The republicans held a meeting on the day Obama was inaugurated and decided to fight him on every issue.  Just google it to see the sources.  They never gave him a chance. 




 Reading the responses, I swear there are more millennials who are conservatives or libertarians on reddit.  Drives me crazy. 




 Ron Paul is not a libertarian or he would believe in choice. 




 True. 




 I don't believe Bush won either election.  He was given the first one and I personally think they cheated in Ohio to win the second. 




 If it is true, good. They need to vote. White youth voted for Romney in the last election, so turnout is critical. 




 And why 90% of the republican party is white, and 96% of Romney's vote was white. 




 Except look at the states they are in control.  Hundreds of laws to take away women's rights, prevent people from voting, or an yes, tax breaks for the rich, not everyone else. 




 Not false.  I read that in the beginning.  They are the same folks that Nixon called the moral majority. 




 I usually start by cutting out white foods - basically sugar and flour.  Can't live like that forever though.
