 LOST reference. Whoever gets it gets it. 




 Sooooo disappointed in the Sand Snakes honestly I was so hyped up about them. They were hot as shit but I guess you can't expect another Oberyn.

 Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or The Shining (basically a crazy person), and Christian Slater as a sociopath in Heathers.

 I was LOLing the whole time because I was imagining a girl who loves dry, barren lands not delicious pastries but in all seriousness: be honest with her, that's what I like people to do with me. I don't think she should have taken advantage of you at the bar when you met, I met a guy at a party the other day and he clearly had beer goggles and although I'm not unattractive I took it as my responsibility to set him straight, as should everyone who meets someone who is clearly drunk. Morals.
