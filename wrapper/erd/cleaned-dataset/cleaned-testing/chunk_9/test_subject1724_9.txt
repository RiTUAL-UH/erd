 This is who I ordered them from on eBay. http://www.ebay.com/usr/imperial_tropicals_fish_store 














 Thanks!  




 Thanks!  




 Thanks! 




 I should add that they are mixed size. 1/4" to 3/4". Maybe a few that are almost 1".  



















 Won't Otos eat some plants?  




  Celestial Pearl Danios

Wow! They look incredible. Thank you.

 I paid $90 with free shipping. I got like 100, plus a few more. One died during shipping.   



















 After a two month fishless cycle with only plants, I introduced 13 Assassin snails due to a small snail problem. A month later I added 100 Red Cherry Shrimp.

I'm looking for a recommendation on adding additional tank mates. Green Neon Tetras and Corys are highly recommended.

 The attention to detail is awesome.  









 Do these function similar like the Arcology in Sim City 2000? 




 Ok, sure. But what about things hitting you?
