 Might I suggest cross posting this to /r/uscg. I think they would like it. 




 I'm going through the Percy Jackson series again. You know... When I'm not working or moving. 




 Even if the CSS is implemented to make is no participation, it's easy to turn that off. And since this sub has very light CSS, it's not really going to change much other than the header and flair. All you need is RES and you can disable the subreddit style and bam. No more issue with the no participation mode. 




 I've removed this post for the following reason:

**If thine picture or moving picture has been used in less than 3 moons (months). After this period thou may use it again.**

 I need to find a good meeting up here and get back in the program. 




 Today marks three years of sobriety for me. It's not been an easy journey. I started in AA but never really jumped into the program. I mostly talked to people. That helped me more than I thought it would. At first, I just listened. I didn't really feel like I belonged. ***I*** didn't have a problem with alcohol. ***I*** wasn't like these people here. But as time went on, I kept going to meetings. At one point I was gifted a copy of the big book. I've still got it, but haven't read it all that much. Mostly I just listened. And as time went on, I started to identify with a bit from this person or something from that person. I started to see similarities in me. I remember when it all clicked. On that day, I stood up and said "Hi. I'm Brent, and I'm an alcoholic." On that day, I chose to give up drinking completely. Three years later and I haven't had a drop of alcohol. Oh, I've been tempted so much over that time. I thought time would diminish the urge and desire to drink and it has... to a point. But I have had days where I wanted to do nothing more than drown my sorrows in a bottle. And those days happen more than I would like. To quote the big book: 
 Remember that we deal with alcohol, cunning, baffling, powerful.

I know I'm tempted nearly every day. But I've made it this far. You can too. 




 I've removed your post because of that. However, if you can find an alternate source, please feel free to resubmit. 




 The Mighty Morg!

I do miss being underway.  




 If I had to guess, I would think that an announcement about SWTOR was made at E3 




 About 2.5 years. Had a blast though and spent the rest of my career trying to get back out to sea. 




 USCGC Munro (WHEC-724) 




 Yep 




 Thankfully, unless it was at night, it was pretty easy to be rescued. At night though, you're fucked 




 It was awe inspiring.  




 Indeed! 




 Yes!!!! The good old Funro. I was on there from 2002-2005 




 It's fun though! 




 Sounds General Quarters! 




 Yet on the calmest of days, it's absolutely amazing 




 As terrifying as it can be, I miss being out to sea 




 If it was a gif, it would have featured me vomiting shortly after
