 You underestimate the numbers of active duty Texans that would obey the chain of command. 




 You hit the nail on the head. It was the worst tech launch fuckup in history. 




 You get warnings in the U.S. too, if you're white. 




 Being that it's Texas, I'm surprised they didn't execute her. 




 Then I would say great, if that's how you want to remember multiplication tables. Whatever works, as long as you can multiply in your head quickly. 




 It's helpful to know your tables.

32 = 8 x 4 = 2 x 4 x 4 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 4 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 2^5

When you have the multiplication tables down you more easily recognize and use these concepts. 




 See @PhysicsProf's answer! Repetition is absolutely critical to everything in math, even concepts. You just have to do pages and pages of the same types of problems to cement the concept in your mind. 




 You need repetition in math for certain things like your basic tables. Then you build on that for concepts. Med students have to do the same thing for organic chem and anatomy. 




 Great answers. Part of the problem is that schools will promote students to the next level despite them obviously not being ready. To me this is even worse than not adequately teaching them. 









 Yet every corporation in America is based in Delaware. 




 That worked! Thanks a lot. I am trying to plug in a credit card reader for a web app. The reader acts like a keyboard but doesn't actually have physical keys so I still need to have the on screen keyboard appear when the focus is in form fields. 




 I tried it on my LG phone and the physical keyboard disabled the on-screen keyboard from appearing. Probably the same thing happens on the Android tablets. 




 Thinking specifically about the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 but I would guess the behavior is probably the same across all Android devices with OTG ports?

 Yes, the only thing holding back the Federal Military and their fighters, bombers, and tanks from subjugating us is our handguns.

I think you're a lot more likely to die from somebody else who has legal or stolen handgun than by the police or military.
 




 This is just my experience but the most plastic bottle waste I've ever experienced was in asia and the middle east. Wherever we went we were offered water in plastic bottles. It's nice to be able to fill up my Nalgene from a drinking fountain that you can find anywhere in the U.S. 




 Dude, I would sue the shit out of Google. 




 Did zil have to choose? Just curious whether he was born with dual citizenship. 




 I meant it in a general sense, that it's difficult for any immigrant to obtain German citizenship. Not trying to single out the Turks. Should have clarified. 




 It seems to me that Germans tend to stay in the Bundesliga. I have absolutely no stats to back up this claim so it's just a fart in the wind but I had to let it out. 




 If you are going to lump Chinese dialects together then you could lump Romantic languages together, including English even though it's a sick bastard child of Romantic and Germanic lines. In which case, the Romantic "dialects" have 1.3 billion speakers.

Edit:  Oops, *romance*, not romantic. 




 Is it losing mass at a high enough rate? The gasses are expanding but being converted into denser matter. I thought the mass would stay relatively constant until it blows off the gas and becomes a white dwarf. 









 The sun is also expanding and one day Earth will be consumed by it so I think standstill isn't one of the bigger worries. 




 I thought it was pretty hard for Turks to gain German citizenship. 




 Why would you ever do any work for free? If you do, even for a moment, you set expectations that you will never be able to overcome. 




 He has a Trkish name. Is he German by birth?

 /r/mildlyinteresting but not easier or faster. 




  the study clearly states that gun ownership is not a risk factor for homicide, merely for method of homicide.

In table 4 the researchers found that gun ownership increased your risk of homicide 2.7X. Also from the article (bolding is mine):

 Despite the widely held belief that guns are effective for protection, **our results suggest that they actually pose a substantial threat to members of the household.** People who keep guns in their homes appear to be at greater risk of homicide in the home than people who do not. Most of this risk is due to a substantially greater risk of homicide at the hands of a family member or intimate acquaintance. We did not find evidence of a protective effect of keeping a gun in the home, even in the small subgroup of cases that involved forced entry. 




 I have to correct your quotation.

The full quote is this:
  "Gun ownership was most strongly associated with homicide at the hands of a family member or intimate acquaintance. Guns were not significantly linked to an increased risk of homicide by acquaintances, unidentified intruders, or strangers.

Meaning:  The people who knew that the guns were at home and where they were located were the ones who used the weapons in the homicide.

I am listening and I appreciate the conversation. The title says that gun ownership was one of the "significant factors" but did not say anything about causality. It could be that the same people who tend to have guns at home may also be prone to other risky behavior. The researchers also admitted this may be the case and that it was difficult to ascertain the effect. I think further study is warranted and it was unfortunate that Congress put the kibosh on it and it still has a chill to this day.

Really, thanks for the civil conversation. It's refreshing to be able to discuss a difficult subject in this way. 




 His position is legally untenable and is basically a revisit to Jim Crow. Marriage laws result in legal privilege that two people can enter. He advocates denying the privilege based on something that even he admits the person has no power to choose. Whether it's sexual preference or skin color, it's can't be a basis to deny legal privilege. 









  1) The topic of the study was completely outside of the purview of the agency.

I think that one of the missions of the CDC is studying injury and violence. If you go to cdc.gov and click on "More Topics" right at the top, you'll see "Injury, violence   safety." Click on it and you'll see a sub-category, "Violence prevention." Click on "About Us" in that division's page and you'll find this:

*Violence is a significant problem in the United States (U.S.). From infants to the elderly, it affects people in all stages of life. In 2012, 16,688 people died as a result of homicide and 40,600 took their own life.*

Why wouldn't you want a government agency studying the risk factors of homicide/suicide/domestic violence, etc? I think it's an important area of study.

 2) The study was performed on data that was artificially limited, in order to produce the pre-ordained result.

The study itself was limited in scope to a statistical study of the effect of gun ownership on the rate of in-home homicide, hence the data was limited to what was within the parameters of the study. The result is the result. 2+2=4; that's not pre-ordained, it just is.

 3) The study was ordered for political reasons in order to support a position, rather than to determine accurate results.

Even if this were true, it's mostly irrelevant. If any study were politically ordered, it should signal that you should be extra careful in evaluating the results but it doesn't mean the results are invalid. What matters is whether the study itself was based on bad data or its methodology was flawed (e.g. the results were manipulated). Nobody has been able to show either of these. On the flipside, the criticism of the study is politically motivated. Does that make the criticism any less valid? Of course not, as long as the critiques have a basis in fact and are not merely unsupported opinion. 




 Even if you assume a political motivation, the results are still valid if the data was good and the methodology was good. There are numerous studies in front of regulatory boards and Congress that were funded by industry or special interests. The reason why firearms are the focus of this CDC study is because they are often purchased for protection and the researchers studied whether the risks statistically outweighed the benefits. Like anything else, decisions should be made with the totality of the body of evidence, not by any single study. 




 I read the entire reason.com article and didn't find any passage that actually tried to show that the CDC's data or methods were wrong or that it was "biased research." It may be because the article appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine after quite a bit of peer review. Your article did offer a lot of political verbiage (i.e. opinions) and cited other studies, which is fine, but it's hardly a scientific rebuttal.

It also criticized the CDC for not studying accidental deaths when it was outside the stated scope of the research. It's like criticising somebody for not test driving Ferraris when they're out shopping for a family car. That's just a silly criticism. 
 




 Then it would not be considered a risk factor. The definition of risk factor is any attribute, characteristic or exposure of an individual that increases the likelihood of developing a disease or injury. 




 The study intentionally focused only identifying major risk factors for homocide. For this study, the scientists purposefully did not include events that were identified as suicides and accidental shootings. 




 "Self-funded" means that the money came from an internal general budget, not commissioned and paid for by an outside source. Senator Arlen Spector sponsored a bill that cut the CDC funding by exactly the amount spent on that study. The message was obviously a punitive one. 



















 TIL something new! I never related sept oct nov dec to 7, 8, 9, 10. 




 Yes... the link jumps to the 99PI website. 









 It doesn't piss me off. It makes me question. It doesn't make you question? 




 No, these aren't man-made. These are time relationships. The point is that the relationship isn't even an integer. 




 A day is a single rotation of the Earth on its axis.

A year equals 365.25636... days. 

Why would God make the ratio so strange? Why isn't it at least an exact integer? Why is it an irrational number?

 I agree, it's embarrassing. I turned on the TV and saw the pitch. WTF?? For an international?? 




 USA back 4 is overdefending Mexico's forward passes but Mexico is not adjusting. They just don't want to play direct. Too bad. USA is defending Mexico's style very well with high pressure on the passer and tight marking, and Mexico doesn't want to change. Mexico's defense is subpar. That step to Bradley leading to the first goal was a poor decision. 82'...Now they are incredibly disorganized. I would be surprised if the back 7 were talking to each other at all right now. 




 Really just can't emphasize this point enough. Thanks for posting. It might be a generational thing as well. I have a 6 year old and I have to constantly remind the grandparents of this.

 Thanks! 




 It's timely because the current web trend is "thin is in." I'm doing a fair amount of that but I am careful with the contrast. A lot of websites are using 70%-ish gray thin sans fonts for body copy and I struggle to read it. 




 I acknowledge your point though I also believe there are guidelines (or rules, whatever you want to call them) that help readability even when the mediums are different. On the web there aren't as many times when you have large amounts of body text so we can get away with using uniform sans fonts like Helvetica and Arial. The question is why when there are more readable sans fonts like Tahoma or Verdana or Unica? 




 You're not the only one bugged by use of title case in buttons but we might be the only two. 




 I agree for print but I agree with @jedrekk that many serif fonts don't look great on standard resolution monitors below 12pt. Agree that Georgia is an exception and it does indeed look good on the screen, much better than Times New Roman. I would love to see Georgia used more widely when there is a lot of body copy. 




 It can be stressful for many people to not be able to rely on a steady paycheck. I'm self-employed but it's definitely not for everybody. You have to spend a lot of (unpaid) time marketing yourself and looking for projects. 









 Your job, when you state a claim, is to back it up. 




 It was designed to be used in small amounts in headlines and advertisements when hot metal typesetting was being used. In small sizes its uniformity makes the text harder to read so it didn't translate well into phototypesetting (and by extension, desktop publishing and web design). Haas, the design house which produced Helvetica, designed a new typeface for phototypesetting called [Haas Unica.](http://www.mengelt-blauen.ch/Typefaces/HaasUnicaPrint.jpg) Unfortunately It was released at a time when phototypesetting was being obsoleted by desktop publishing and thus didn't get the attention it deserved.

 Good point. 




 You mistake stating disbelief for stating an argument. Here's an illustration:

Claimant:  "I am Superman."

Me:  "I don't believe you."

On whom should the burden of proof fall? 




 I didn't make any argument. I asked for the statistics that the commenter referred to when they wrote "statistically speaking...." 




 Show your statistics. 




 And in the days after 9/11 the only non-military airplane that the Bush administration allowed to take off carried Saudi passengers. 




 After 9/11 the U.S. should have invaded Saudi Arabia. But because the Saudi Royals are close friends of the Bushes, the U.S. invaded Iraq instead. 




 And she has what proof? This belongs in /r/thathappened 




 Not so easy for pants. My jeans and some slacks ride low on the hips. I have other pants that ride higher on the waist. They vary by 1-2" in size. 




 I like to rest my hands on boobs when spooning. Would that be off limits? 




 There is way more variation between professors at a school than between schools.

University is a very different environment than high school. You will meet fellow students who are driven and motivated and they will sort of pull you along (and you will pull them along). All the students are in the same boat, so to speak. Don't think that your high school friends are the only ones you will have. It's highly unlikely you'll still have close relationships with them by your 4th year, even if you go to UCSD. College is the time you all start going your own way. 




 PM me. Let's be friends. 




 I didn't mean that your efforts were meaningless. I thought it was a good exercise. I meant that the underlying data itself was meaningless.
