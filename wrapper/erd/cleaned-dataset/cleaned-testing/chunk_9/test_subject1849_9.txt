 So the USA can get the best trade deal possible, so we don't lose, even though this contradicts the claim that trade benefits all.  




 Basically, trade hopes to relocates the pollution to developing countries that would otherwise be polluted in developed countries, so we have time to "specialize", so we can combat pollution in our country and export methods to other countries to combat pollution. Then, we hope that those countries grow + combat pollution. Afterwards, the pollution that would have been polluted in the developing country moves to another country. 

^ free-market view of trade to promote anti-enviromental laws apparently  




 On drugs 




 Wooh there on the artwork geez lol 




 Yes because the money cards are still worth a lot. 




 No problem. It is basic economics, but I am still skepticial.  




 I think I'll keep him for another round, so it is differential from the other teams. Most teams already look very similar.  




 What are some midfielders that might gain in value over the next couple of rounds? 




 I am planning to rework my defense of Woodberry, Avila, Mears, and Burling. What are some good budget replacements? Is Avila going to be on the bench, since he hasn't started in the last two games? 




 More "competition", reduced prices of goods, specialization of sectors of economies, helping developing countries, and more exports for our businesses and more imports for our consumers (however if you export too little compared to amount to import, you run a trade deficit) 




 Are you a consumer or a blue collar worker? Are you a small business owner or a large corporation? Are you in a one industry town or a diversified economy city? Are you concerned about exporting more goods than importing or Do you want more imported goods than exported goods? Do you want just the USA to have the fruits of economic growth (protectionism) or do you want to grow other developing countries (expand trade)?  




 Kljestan! wow.... I transferred you out for Jorales. . 




 Konami might want to promote it, since it is a recent set with more support in Clash of Rebellion. 




 Ultra Rare Expressroids - This

Jetroid/Decoyroid/Gyroids maybe your best commons to pick up, since they are wind roid monsters, which matches the theme of speedroids.

Also, any generic anti-synchro cards or generic synchro support cards like tuners, synchrons, synchro monsters like Stardust Dragon, Plant synchros, synchro spells. synchro traps, etc because Konami will probably want the card game to coincide with the Arc-V storyline, where the characters are in the synchro dimension. 

The set won't be out until October, so you still have over the summer to pick up the stuff. 



 




 Maybe {{Discord}} ? 

Anti-Special Summoning of Synchros :O 




 Maybe, but not really, since Anti-Magic Arrows is anti-Supercharge.  




 To be honest, if you want a deck that might increase in value due to rise in strength, I recommend that you make Zefras, since it is the most recent set. BAs will probably get hit, so ya. 




 Roids need that training field field spell! But... It isn't released in the ocg 




 Arc v 




 When arch reaches fusion dimension, time to get those cards! :D 




 Basically any synchro related cards because konami might want to shift the meta from lots of xyzing to synchro summoning  




 Ultra rare expressroids 




 Woodberry. Why do I transfer him in at the wrong time? . 




 They pay the excise tax based on tax incidence.  




 Bernie is within the margin of error and above 30% in the polls, so a far cry from "unknown" 




 It is still early in the primaries.

The same could be applied to O-Malley and Chafee.  




 BACON! :D 




 HA! I like the scared dino in the bottom right. 




 LOL 




 It can be strange, funny, odd, stupid, or ridiculous. 




 So essentially, we want to counter cHina's growth, which was helped by our Permanent Normal Trade Relations with them, with another trade agreement. We are concerned about China's economic and political influence with a growing military power in the Pacific, yet we provided them with capacity to manufacture their might. it might be sound economics, but isn't this a bit strange? 




 I mean... Most people prefer social issues than economics to talk about. 




 Firebirds  United  




 Differentials went wrong lol 




 But it has to be secret so the U.S. Can get the best trade deal possible! We can't get a bad deal that will benefit the pacific nations like China. the point of TPP is to counter China's growth. :)  




 Ecomics isn't even fact when there are so many schools of thought on how to deal with deadweight loss on taxes, effects of the minimum wage, externalities, politics, etc 




 I wouldn't trust NH's polling, since it is an open primary. Republicans could just say that they will vote for Bernie and not actually support him.   




 It sounds better too 




 Clash of Rebellions and Dimension of Chaos will probably have the D/D/Ds 




 Firebirds? 




 Firebirds? CMON! The next "united" team will be Minnesota . if they come.  




 So conservative lawmakers in Louisiana want to raise taxes, which is against the values of Grover?

So... How do you balance the budget? Only cut spending by blaming Jindal for increases in spending? 




 So essentially what you are saying is that outsourcing the entire manufacturing sector overseas is a good idea? 




 So essentially trade deficits don't matter.

As long as import a lot to satisfy the consumer base and export at a rate less than import growth, then it is "good" for the economy.  




 We should outsource most or all of our manufacturing overseas. :) 




 Ya. Maybe he or she or it is in the passenger side? 




 True. DGW rounds haven't been so great this year :\ 




 Took a -8

transfered out Kljestan due to red card for Jorales

Captained Jorales

Mears, Burling, and Woodberry didn't start. 

Jorales - Red Card

Kljestan scores 11 points

I am DONE! 

*flips table* 




 Mears is on the bench. Lol 




 Klejstan got a red card, so I would lean on Keane with a strong midfield with Zardes also there. 




 Don't forget that Philly loaned out Zac MacMath to the Colorado Rapids lol 




 If Trade policy =/=  address Trade Deficits, then what does? Internal demand for importing goals and supplying goods for export? 




 I am just presenting the other side's view in a sarcastic tone.  




 Do people really think TAA will pass in the House seperately? 




 Economics is a dismal science. It isn't always right or wrong or soemtimes unpredictable.  




 Because Trade Deficits DON'T MATTER! :D

The same people, who claim that Fiscal Deficits do matter, yet there might be link between trade and fiscal deficits. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_deficit_hypothesis

"The twin deficits hypothesis, also called the double deficit hypothesis or twin deficits anomaly, is a macroeconomic proposition that there is a strong link between a national economy's current account balance and its government budget balance"

Of course, the national deficit has been dropping while we continue trade deficits at the moment.  




 Don't forget. We are helping developing countries and reducing global poverty in an ever globalized economy. With specialization of each country, the USA should fully or mostly outsource its manufacturing industry and then we focus on high-tech/service jobs. As a matter of fact, every country should abolish all protectionist programs like subsidies, tariffs, immigration limits, quotas, etc to ensure an ever peaceful world. :D Even most economists and liberals say that immigrants don't take jobs away. In fact, they create more jobs.  




 TPP is good because we need to trade with countries with rules written by the EXPERTS, which are 90%+ of economists and big corporations. If 95% of scientists say that climate change is real, then economists must be right. Also, it is secret to ensure that we can get the best trade deal possible and don't lose. You know... Nobody loses in trade remember? (Comparative Advantage!) Also trade deficits don't matter because as long as consumers are happy with lower prices and we are exporting, then it is a win win situation. Cmon... Does anybody really want higher prices on goods and want a short run recession by blocking trade especially with the growing economies in the Pacific, which we already trade with? We will combat their growth with more trade with rules to hinder their growth, which they don't even know :D. Even Budget Deficits don't matter as long you invest in a country. You know... After World War 1, Germany had to export so many goods and consumer can't consumer as many goods with hyperinflation to repay its debt to the winners? 




 Trade Deficits don't matter! :) 




 free Trade is good! I got cheaper products! Wahoo! Trade deficits don't matter :) 




 Are you suggesting that Trade Deficits don't matter? 




 But Negative Impact on manufacturing, blue collar workers, Mexican Farmers/Big Agriculture, Land Owners in the Southwest with increased illegal immigration, Income Distribution, One Industry Cities, Drug Culture in the USA/Mexico with the easier ability to sell drugs, Trade Deficits.  




 "Who even plays Yu-Gi-Oh?" - says the guy talking to a person playing yugioh LOL 









 The stadium must be expandable because...... What if demand rises so much within the next 20 years? Do the Revs another stadium in 30 years? 




 I know most people are going to use the wildcard this week, but I don't really want to remodel my entire team, since I planned some beforehand. Can I take a -4, -8, or maybe -12 instead of the wildcard? 




 I bet the fusion will require just 2 monsters cards and be a stable fusion monster. 




 LA Galaxy not ring a bell? 




 Back when we had "classical liberals", the conservatives were the tories. LOL

So... Are Conservatives today's Tories? Of course not. The Liberals opposed British Traditionalism.  




 Would they oppose a society, where most people aren't in prisons? 




 Yes. Kljestan, who is another assist maker for BWP, is also on a red card.  




 Upstart Goblin 




 Shouldn't it be obvious? Mayors tend to be from big cities and cities don't vote Republican. However, it would have been a great opportunity for them to maybe try to get mayoral support for 2016.  




 I was well aware that this happened. lol 




 OUSTED gets so many points after I transferred him out during the unlimited transfers week.... 




 And ppl predicted that Toia wouldn't be a good option since he got 1 points on fantasy at times. 




 Kljestan - red card.

Luke Moore - sub out and took a -4 on....

Avila not staring

:/ 




 To be honest, everybody has weird obsessions. Some people spend so much money on clothes/shoes that they don't really need. Some spend money just attending sports games every week. Some spend on art collections. Etc 




 Roids 




 Sure. Bendik hasn't been starting for weeks.  




 Okay. I think it is time to start taking risks because other teams have over $121 million dollars of value. i am still below it. Thanks! 









 He could be a pro-trade economist or a person with an interest in exporting goods. Did you know the Liberal Democrat Party of UK supports the EU (free-trade zone) in the similar manner?  




 True, but it is a good testing ground because countries operate as countries. You could then argue that since "most developing countries have mandated healthcare system in some sort of manner", then the USA shouldn't follow it because x, y, z....

Like how Republicans say each states are "testing grounds" even though each state has a different economy.  




 We should lobby Congress to oppose any efforts to build modern roofing. :D

Liberals these days want to tax and spend and bankrupt the country with pork barrel spending. They should leave the job for us, the Private Sector! 




 So basically mostly Eastern Europe and former Soviet Union blocs with a couple of Middle Eastern and South American countries. 

I would expect booming economic growth from these countries... Right?  









 It seems like the flat tax does appear to correlate in the state level with stable economic growth.  

Not so much on the national level with with "eastern europe, sporadic nations and a bunch of micronations."  




 Weirdly, the Interstate Highway system would cost between 1/2 to 1 trillion dollars in today's money value.  




 Just wondering...What countries have a flat income tax like Rand's proposal? 




 In the mean time, we should build temporary roofing because it is cheaper and more economically efficient for the years to come. :) 




 Don't worry. if a recession happens due to a construction stoppage, it will be Obama's fault. :) 




 Jetroid maybe in the future for bluff lol 




 So probably in the October/November/December of 2015.  




 Because it has to be secret to ensure that the negotiations favor US trading interests, since we might get a bad trade deal with all those amendments from politicians from all 16+ countries that will expose the secerts inside, even though we know all trade lifts all boats. :) 









 I HIGHLY DOUBT that the House GOP will pass TAA separately, after TPP fast track has already been signed into law. 

There is literally no incentive for them to do so. lol 














 Barbaroid with Poly? 




 SPEEDROIDS! 




 What is not to say that U.S. Also has currency manipulation and stealing of intellectual property of foreign countries?  




 How? If the U.S. Wanted to contain China, they should stop normal permanent trade relations with China? We helped China's rise and now we complain about it? Really? 




 When will politicians address the trade deficit? Each time America has agreed to a freetrade agreements our trade deficit always increases with imports rising faster than exports. 




 don't forget the growing us trade deficit  




 So... Trade Deficits don't matter right?  




 I still want to know whether TPP will reduce our trade deficit or do trade deficits don't matter according to some? 




 The USA engaged in trade, but was very protectionist until the Great Depression and World Wars throughout our industrial revolution. 

Our Free-Trade agreements has increased our trade deficits throughout many decades. Should we continue to have negative trade deficits? According to many, "trade deficits don't matter." supposedly. 

China has some protectionist tariffs on US made goods, while we have low tariffs on Chinese goods. I highly doubt any country such as India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, etc have 0% tariffs on our goods. 

We subsidize our agriculture industry to the point that made Mexican agriculture nearly uncompetitive and caused many displaced workers to immigrate to America illegally. 

Outsourcing and Automation has played a major part in the deindustrialization of one industry cities in the Midwest. 

Overspecialization of certain economic sectors can be bad for any country, if something external happens.
Remember: Alberta's Recent Oil Troubles, since US stopped buying as much of Canadian oil? 

http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/flowchart/2011/06/30/why-us-companies-arent-so-american-anymore

How is it that we are worried about China's economic growth, yet we already engage in Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China? We are concerned about and have been aiding their growth, yet somehow TPP will somehow curb China's power according to John Boehner, Obama, etc? 

How is TPP the most "progressive" trade deal for Obama, yet conservative enough for Republicans in Congress? If TPP will make trade in level terms, then there isn't as much of a comparative advantage incentive, so..... How does that actually work?
