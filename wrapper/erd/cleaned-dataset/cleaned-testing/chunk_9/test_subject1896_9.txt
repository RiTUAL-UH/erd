 What if it's just a female kitten who identifies as a male kitten? /s 




 Definitely seen some really good work from this artist. 




 Thanks for the vote of confidence that it will be an easy process! Where do I go for carpet? Home Depot? 




 Even then, I'll still just borrow the book from someone in a later session. 




 Hi guys

I'm used to eating rice, for every meal. Or some form of starch like potatoes.

However, I know that rice is high in calories, esp the amount I'm used to eating. Is there an alternative to rice that's lower in calories, that would fill me up along side my protein? I've started introducing more vegetables to my plate, but it's not the same.

Thanks!

 




 The first is a tip that I got in a question I posed earlier this year.

1. Say "I'll eat it later." As the lovely commenter told me, later often doesn't come. However, in my mind, it's nice to know that I could eat it if I wanted to, but won't.

2. Brush your teeth after your meal. As we learned growing up, brushing your teeth is often equated with not eating for the next few hours.


Hope these little things help you on your journey!

 Thanks again for your reply. If the prosecutor decides there wasn't enough evidence, what can my mom do to continue to persecute him. 




 Thanks for your reply. Can you answer this q: What exactly is happening when my mom pressed charges?  




 Yeah you did. 




 I read the meme before the title and was sure the title was going to say "My roommate wants to know why I sniff her yoga pants crotches." 




 *ducking 




 I shook my head as I closed this link. I guess that's a mark that your post is in the right place.  




 Wine, beer, fashion...? 




 Can you tell us how it is to have a duck as a pet? 




 I work in social media marketing and I've had very different experiences with Facebook ads. Facebook ads have tremendously helped my clients reach audiences they sought out to reach.

What it takes is extremely good targeting. Geo targeting, interests, demographics, etc. Though, I don't deny the claims the presenter makes, I think there is a way to be successful with them. 









 You rock. THANKS. 




 I don't think it's the oil because I just checked the status of the oil and I'm getting "OK." 




 Thank you for your response! If I'm reading it right, the oil says 2100 miles. Does that mean I'm 2100 over or have 2100 left or neither? 




 No prob Alex. However I realize I only sent one thing that was in my dash. Here are the rest and let me know if this changes anything.

 BJ, great work in Saving Mr Banks.

My question is: What's your biggest advice for comedy writers aspiring to make it big? And how did the transition from behind the camera to on the camera happen for you? 




 So helpful for a noob. Thanks! 




 Alex, thank you so much! Can you tell me which picture told you that? 




 Hahaha, my buddy wanted to photo bomb. Thanks for the compliment. 









 Hi Hank! 
What about The Simpsons do you think contributes to its unique longevity?

And how did your vocal talents play a role when you were growing up? 




 Usually, when I'm out of position with a decent hand like AK or mid-small pair and the flop comes something like J74r or even J44 (or in other words, a flop that I think could have missed us both), then I check.  If the villain makes a smallish bet, I will call. Then on the turn, if it helps me or not, I will bet, and 75% of the time, the villain will fold. 




 Thanks man! 









 I wish I had money to give you gold for this comment. Instead, I've screenshot it and sent it to my friends to have a laugh with me. Thanks.  




 I would just like to say "Fuck you" to imgur's little gallery thing on RES.
