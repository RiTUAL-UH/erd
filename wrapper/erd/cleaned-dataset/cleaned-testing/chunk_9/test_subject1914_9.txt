 (Passionately) Thanks boss I won't let you down!  




 I mean When is Poo not sappy...wait a minute  




 Lyon 2025, just won the quintuple  




 Hi everyone. I'll cut to the chase because we need to get through this awkward post. I've been clinically depressed for about 5 years suicidal for 2 and I just wanted to sincerely thank this community for giving me an escape and making me feel like I'm worth something to someone. even on a game. It means a lot and I love you all  




 I've spoken about my situation so much can we keep it light. I'm sorry for the bother but.i'm craving killing myself I've been wanting to for nearly 3 years now. and this is the night where I'm not going to be a coward and chicken out  




 Holy shit  




 Like see if it works on a windows pc ? 




 Im not 100% positive of anything ! How do i find out if its failing ? 




 but how else are we going to show we're all funny in a  kind of nostalgic way 




 GET YOUR FUCKING TITS OUT !!!!!!! 




 I did that already, same thing happened  




 COCKS OUT LADS ITS HAPPENING  




 Hi everyone I apologise if this is not a suitable question  for this subbreddit but I don't know where else to go. 

So I have a seagate 500gb hardrive that I used with a windows laptop. wanting to use this hardrive with a mac I tried to format it in Disk utility, However every time i try to Partition the hardrive. Or repair it. or erase it. it always comes up with an error saying 'File system formatter failed'. 

Is there anything I can do. Any help will be greatly appreciated  




 I really admire him, and I wish I was more like him. I can relate to everything he's saying. 'Fuck em' too right ! 




 Me too. I need another Scorsese Gangster film in my life ! 




 Wow he sounds like quite an incredible man. wish i had a grandpa like that ! 




 Is it confirmed because i've been reading rumours for a long time ? 




 Tell me more about him  




 Shit now i look like an idiot  




 Im writing that on my desk so i can read it every day 




 I haven't no,but I cant see why you cant submit into multiple contests. It'd probably say in the rules somewhere but i cant see why that would be banned. 

I will They don't announce till october but it gives me a sense of adrenaline when I'm writing its cool ! 




 Thats Exactly what I was thinking I guess I just wanted to hear it from someone else. I just want to write and improve my craft and enjoy it  




 Yeah thats true ! Thanks for the support  




 I think writers who think of the other stuff are people doing it for the wrong reasons personally  




 I mean I just want to write great pieces I think that if i start thinking about other stuff like studios and finances you start to not concentrate on your writing. Most of the contests i've seen has a short category so i guess Short scripts are still valued pretty highly 

Why are all my posts being downvoted ? What the fuck did I say ? 




 Maybe I really Love the characters and narrative i've done. I haven't planned on it because I developed it strictly as a short. I might write another short with a similar protagonist and story world E.G Drive/Only God forgives

How about you. want to trade and read each others ? 




 A short  




 Thanks :) 




 The shore scripts screenwriting competition. I don't think its very prestigious or anything but there was a deadline soon so i thought why not. Is there a list or a calendar of must enter contests or anything. Theres so many out there I don't know which ones are worth entering  




 Yeah I got rid of Gourcuff pretty early to expensive. I tried to build the team around Grenier for a few years. 
Benzia did a good job for me but he never became a star-player for me. Sell him with a profit percentage in the deal would be my advice 




 Yeah thats what i've heard and I enjoy writing to a deadline and i've been getting upset lately because people have been telling me the way to get noticed as a writer is to make the film. which i don't like ( did a very practical film making course hated it) sorry to rant but yeah writing for contests is fun and a good way to get noticed :)  




 Hi everyone I'm not sure if this post is appropriate but i've just submitted a script to my first contest and i really enjoyed it. I've been getting really worried lately about how to break into the industry and blah blah blah but I'm just going to focus on my writing getting better and entering contests and if my work is good it'll get noticed. I just wanted to share. I'm enjoying working to deadlines and its very rewarding. 




 Well starting off they have some really terrific youngsters. Ferri Fekir. and you have a pretty good squad starting off. but you have to get rid of gourcuff (shit speller sorry) he's on like 84k. Get rid of him and try to add some cheap young players to the ones you already have then you can try and flip them for profit. Hope that is some help  









 I Think its a very fair comparison. Both are quiet but ultimately want the same things 'Companionship' 'Love' but they both know that can never happen and are destined to stay alone because of their actions. Both pretty sociopathic but feel like their actions are for a just cause.

So I think its a good comparison  




 Those Red Wing boots are sexy ! 




 well i've just finished a short that took about 2months ish including development and research  




 I was doing good until i saw that lonely guy thread on here, making me remember I'm lonely. dammit i was having a good day ! 




 Haha no worries ! got any good saves going on at the moment ? 




 I bet you're fun at parties  




 heres a link to it, I'm a little dumb so i dont know an easier way of linking it but here it is

 Hey Guys was just wondering if anyone wanted to read the 3rd draft of a short I wrote. Look forward to getting some feedback. Thanks a lot 

P.S I don't have a name for my main character yet so I'm just calling him LOSER for now. https://benosullivanwritesstuff.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/sex-addict-project-draft-3-2.pdf 




 Cool mate cant wait to share 




 who cares  




 easier said than done isn't it. i need a drastic change of though process and mentality  




 sorry for coming of as brash its not like I'm holding on on purpose. because of the anxiety i have ruminating thoughts which means these thoughts of lauren are always there. and i don't know how to get rid of them. being with her is the only feeling of happiness i've ever had. i want to let go. just how ? 




 do not tell me how i feel. I'm not going on a 'self-pitying rant' i thought this subbreddit was called ofmychest. i thought i was allowed to come and get something off my chest not be judged or be told what to do by you. 




 Thought he was great in 'Brooklyns finest' 'Dead Poets society' and the 'Before' trilogy  




 Cool lets be friends ! shall we write to each other ? 




 Hey everyone basically i've had a super rough year and i've lost a lot and learned a lot (feel free to go through my post history to get a flavour of whats been happening) Looking for some friends or just someone to write to. Im a aspiring writing and looking for something a bit more real in life. anyone want to be friends ? 




 yeah should be, RDJ PR guys should get a massive bonus after coming out of this episode being seen as the good guy  




 There both in the wrong yet RDJ is getting defended because he's the star who is well-liked because tons of PR guys work night and day to make him funny and likeable and this time it didnt go his way, its justified in his Unprofessionalism ? part of any job is dealing with curve balls, thats just life and clearly From what i've read in these comments RDJ is justified in his immature behaviour.  




 i understand humans act childish when they lose control of my emotions but part of RDJ job is to look a certain way in the public eye, public imagine is obviously massive for RDJ so he has an obligation to maintain professionalm, not all of our jobs involve looking cool and maintaining  an image. Krishnan wasnt gossiping he asked quite broad question about his past clearly trying to work a certain issue. Fucking joke   




 Im so glad someone else agrees ! 




 i think it was an attempt to talk about an issue or is RDJ the only one allowed to talk about drug problems ? he's allowed to use it for positive 'i've turned it around publicity' but when its used for an agenda relating to a wider issue its not allowed, well since he's heard it a million times before maybe he should learn to act with a sense of dignity and decorum rather than confirming the primadona steroytype. I understand he gets personal questions a lot and it must be frustrating but it makes it worse if he gets it a lot and he acts this childish, have a sense of a workplace ethic, pretty embarrassing on RDJs part. 

What a joke.  




 Getting up, making a sarky comment and walking out, is not being respectful in my opinion. and he made a big song and dance and walked out. hardly very respectful. He was there to promote the film but the interviewer wasnt there has to be a mutual give and take in this situation  




 He wasnt But the interviewer was. my point being there has to be a bit of give and take he'll get his movie promoted sure but he has to give a bit back to the interviewer give and take. i made my point pretty clear not my fault you failed to understand it 




 Yes it probably does and i get that, but surely with his past he must find a way of mainting a bit of professionalism, I think it speaks volumes about his character that he petulantly gets up and walks out. or am i the only one who thinks he should act more professionally. or because he's a star who can afford to walk of stuff he hates doing that makes it okay ? 




 Well i think throwing your toys out of the pram is not handling it nicely at all, i think its a very rude and immature way of dealing with it, he's the star so he throws a tantrum. He's not there to promote the film he's there to talk about an issue, It cant all be about him there has to be some give and take, RDJ acted like a big-baby  




 But do you not think there has to be a give and take when it comes to doing these things, we'll promote your movie but you have to give us something to support this news segment. surely there has to be some leeway don't you think ? RDJ Should act a bit more professional i understand he does it all day but he acted like a petulant little twat. 




 please do, talk later 




 you're giving me hope say more things like that  




 what do you mean ? because i've been suicidal for like 2 years now and have yet to experience the euphoric high  




 thats kind of how i felt when i was with my ex
