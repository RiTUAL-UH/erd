 Like being weightless and in space isn't awesome enough we try to send them holo lens.  




 Thats my boy! 




 This is [him](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i5kdLvxIycU/UB6HsjiZQBI/AAAAAAAAAMg/_Bp9fkarvmg/s1600/dog+tv.gif) when you ask what hes up to. 




 I have the same sigelei . is that the 150w? I love mine. I use that case to. Feels good in the hands. 




 I found my Sasquatch hair on a fence. I had top scientists examine it n they said it was baby sas fur. Caught a [pic](http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/4uz_sFueG80/0.jpg) of it too. Ether way ill take on your pubes any day. I barely need juice cause theres magic n shit in dat hair. 




 Don't get me wrong bro, polar bear fur chucks tits but my Sasquatch hair don't require boiling. Just got to pick out dem bugs n shit. 




 Proof that cats = up-votes. No title, low action, cat, 4010 fucking karma. 




 That's awesome. Nice job.

Edit: woah, somehow I stumbled upon this website that has the same location as your time laps. Did you take these as well? Also I thought Jupiter was the brighter star on the right side of the moon but thats actually Venus?  




 I live in Maine and had such a beautiful view. Half the sky was dark with stars the other was a sunset with a bright moon and Jupiter. I really wish I got a pic. Was it Jupiter that was on the right side of the moon? Im pretty sure it was, super bright. Is Venus on the upper left of the moon?  




 Apparently he has no reply to that. What a fucking dick. So if I spell something wrong that discredits my point? Debunk that fuck face. 




 Yea pretty much. Way to many questions. If you read it with a Indian accent it is very clear. 




 Man Im really sorry for your friends. I had to read the email a few times to catch the red flags. My first thought was aw his poor wife but Im glad I took a closer look. 




 I replied to his email and tried to be polite and asked some of these questions without making him suspicious. Ive yet to hear a reply. I saw this was a scam pretty quickly

 Well this seem legit. It must be real cause who would make up a story like this!? It also says the word god a lot and I like that I must like and share to claim my prayer. 




 I saw an interview with one of the actors. They said that the box was originally just a joke but they kept bringing it up and it grew on them. But if their making another movie it will probably revolve around the box so the contents might not have been written yet. 




 I like your thought process! Those are all really good points. I bet it is a drug of some sort when you put it that way. 




 Hey thanks a lot. At first I thought it was something that condensed vapor clouds so rooms don't fill with fog. I didn't take much time looking into it and there wasn't much info on that site. Much appreciated!  




 That looks very time consuming.  




 Check out PLEX. It lets you stream any videos you have on your computer on your Roku. I use it and it doesn't slow your computer at all. I have an older computer and I would never be able to watch 2 videos at the same time. Also the app automatically adds the cover art of your videos and TV shows. Its really the closest thing I can think of that your looking for. 




 Finally a real friggin date.  




 wow. Thats an amazing picture. Thats all I have to say about that... 




 Curl your tongue so the tip of it is touching under your tongue and pull in to the back of your throat kind of pulse it so it pushing air out and bring it back to where it started. The whole time keep it curled. YOu dont even need breath when you do it this way but its all preference. Some people do one or the other or both together. 




 Do the lip curl thing for sure. I actually combine the tongue push with the cough to get a little more distants and consistency. Also it helps to kind of push out your lower jaw a bit until you find a sweet spot. Another trick is to look in a mirror and try to make a perfect O with your mouth then its all about the push out. But yeah, keep practicing. 




 I feel your rage. Personally I try to stay as far away as I can from people like this. You can't fill a cup that's already full... 




 Instead of balls it comes like a rope. So you just cut a piece off, split it in half and wick. Its so convenient. The package says Organic pharmaceutical cotton but its not as soft as normal organic cotton. I love what it says on the package... "hunted almost to extinction by crazed sub-ohmers, the elusive yeti is sought after for its fine absorbent fur." 




 I have a Sigelei 150w. Thing blows my mind. YOu can find them for under a 100 online. Thats my 2 cents. Have fun, be safe. 




 That looks pretty got for hand twisted. Nice job man. Never tried doing it by hand ive always used a drill. What are the pros/cons for hand twisting? IM just guessing more work? 









 cool man that's good to know. Im not in that band anymore but I still play everyday. alone or not. You still playing? 




 whos ohmeohmyke? 




 Dude that's awesome you were there. I had so much fun at that show. We did an awesome job but I remember people where getting antsy for streetlight towards the end of our set and was being dicks. Not cause of our music but cause they couldn't wait for streetlight.  




 No it was kinda an inside joke. In high school when we first got together we tried out a band name generator and Afghan banana stand was one of the results. We hated it but we would keep referencing it constantly so it stuck. Quick story time! We were writing lyrics one day that said something about pushing the principles car into traffic and got sent to his office. When he asked what our band name was our guitarist said Brazilian bikini tan as a joke and so he didn't know our real name which ended up becoming our album Afghan banana stand presents Brazilian bikini tan. 




 So if there going to premier it I assume shortly after that it might be coming out. Thank you for the info! 




 Before anyone asks the banana was our mascot way before the whole Banana for scale thing started. 




 [Here](http://i.imgur.com/fNHimyw.jpg?1) it is. Everyone loved our album cover haha 




 Fatty tweeted that its coming soon and there wrapping up production almost a year ago and I cant seem to find any info on it. They keep saying its coming but Ive yet to see any type of announcement or anything. Anyone know anything? I don't know about you but I CANT FUCKING WAIT!!!! 









 AzcStee saves the day!  




 That clears things up a bit. Thanks for your response. I have 2 married sets that Ill only use then. I'm deff glad I asked before I did some real damage. Ill keep my odd batteries for other things. Thanks again. 









 I actully found that [pic](http://i.imgur.com/5kUtlq8.jpg?2) 




 Im going to go watch season 8 again. Forgot how much I liked that season. 




 Actually I think this is a good idea. I think if your going to see a band live you should just enjoy the moment and listen to the music. You can fuckin tweet meaningless shit later.  




 That would be awesome. You mean kinda like people do with beer bottle caps? It wouldn't take a B M long to do this ether.
