 This is on the way up to the angel trail head on the south rim.  




 [Album]( http://imgur.com/a/5DLCr). It was a 24 mile rim to rim hike last week. The weather was actually really nice when I did it. It was my first time seeing the Grand Canyon and it was amazing.  









 For real doe 



















 Yea exactly. And I had hulu for a while but like netflix more. The newer shows on hulu offset the commercials because it is cheaper than cable and the commercials are shorter. You have some control on commercials. 

I get it when people complain about "paying for commercials" but hulu is the lesser evil between cable and itself. Assuming you dont also have cable.

 Yea she gives amazing head 




 Can I join? 




 Aww you caught me.

 Reddit is a link aggregation site. The whole point started out as linking other people's stuff. The truth is that /u/gallowboob posts high quality and relevant content,  so what that he didnt create every single picture himself.  




 And he contributes a lot of shops on /r/photoshopbattles and /r/birdswitharms. He also posts sources for most gifs. 

Yea he occasionally reposts, but for the most part its crossposts and original stuff. And he interacts with reddit and spreads content. I would honestly be less entertained by reddit if he and other linkers werent here. 
 




 Yea I havent had cable for years either. Too cheap/poor to buy it when I moved to my apartment at school.  And then after I moved out I was used to no tv. And splitting a netflix account costs me a couple bucks a months.  




 Chem to EE for me. As hard as the engineering circlejerk goes on reddit, some of the other majors are so much harder.  




 Two marijuanas! 




 Yeah, milk that reply trickle karma.

 




 Wut 




 But dude this guy on chewyChan.org told me stuff and he sounded pretty sure.  




 So theres a chance? 




 Im so thankful that I can take so much shit for granted.  




 Typical kile 




 When you are to cheap to buy gold but want to show appreciation.  




 Dat kiss and hug doe 




 And actually its even more funny about the admin because the answer they gave was the exact instructions to change reddit's language. They just gave them in spanish.  It was the top comment too if I remember correctly.  




 Cada cuenta en reddit es un bot, excepto usted.

Its my second highest comment 




 I ran a candy business in middle school 




 Cant find the video that im thinking of, but he got a call from a telemarketer and set them up saying the account holder had to talk to him and it would come to the phone in a sec. He then muted him, and called a scammer. Told the scammer a similar story but gave the other guys name. Then said to both of them "ok here he is" and switched them onto each other. 

They introduced each other and then talked about "the account" for a couple minutes before one was like "why are asking me all this" then the other guy was like "you called me."
After a couple "nuh uh you"'s they fought and hung up.

 




 I found one. https://youtu.be/021GfNuhrRY 




 There was a prank caller on youtube that would do this. He would call a scammer or telemarketer and set them up by saying sonething like yea let me get the owner for you. Then transfer them to each other. 

I think tom mabe has done it and so has ownagepranks. I'll look up some videos in a sec.  




 All female orgy, suck 8 lips 




 HL3 confirmed 




 The toilet 




 No

 A Yoshi fucked my mom or something.  You're starting to bore me.

 




 But its more exciting if you do. 




 Dude, I have never seen the last half of that movie until like a week ago. It is incredibly sad. :/ 




 Is that "small"? 




 Isnt that the country that doesnt exist? 




 I always thought it was a a fake screen cap, I never knew there was a video and the troll went deeper.  




 I appreciate your appreciation 




 /r/catslaps for more cats being jerks 




 Bruh 




 just hire some undergrad English student to proofread.  

Yea at the minimum wage of whatever country that kid works in? 

And offering free stuff to do it or opening up the doors to anyone to edit it allows the possibility of vandalism. Think of wikipedia and how often it is vandalized. The power of wikipedia is that there are millions of users that quickly correct or revert things, usually within minutes or hours. What you are proposing doesnt have any checks in place. 

Imagine if reddit wrote a manual. We would add a bunch of inside jokes and easter eggs and trolls and how would the manufacturers know? They already suck at english as you said, so how would they know to correct vandalism.  




 The general idea is you bring in something valuable and they hold it for you to let you borrow money.  After some time you can come back and "buy" your thing back for what they borrowed plus some fee. Normally people want their shit back and pay. That is a self supporting business model if everyone came to get their shit back.

But when people dont get their shit back because they can't afford it or dont want it, then the shop will sell it. Usually at enough of a markup to regain the loan money, fees, and price of storage. Yea its not a lot of profit they make, but it is enough that there are so many pawn shops springing up. The other way is that the person will explicitly say they dont want it back, then the shop will buy it for less in an attempt to maximize potential profits. 

What you have to realize is that once they have a shop, storing one extra piece isnt all that much more cost. Once they are able to cover rent/mortgage costs, they can store as much as will fit in the shop without extra cost. 




 Documentation. Yea I know its necessary and sharing your ideas and work is super important and required and all, but its just so boring.  




 Prolly cuz she hasnt wiped in a month.  




 Mmm, cheese on hotdogs 




 And some of them are young... seriously, who likes old coke. 




 She seems like a jerk 




 Yea and when the dog finally gets to the bathroom he licks his owner clean.  




 the one I had in middle school only showed us pics of stds and said we would get that if we played with each other. 

You get the cunnilingus briefing in the highschool sex ed talk with megan under the bleachers at a football game.  




 But for a breif instant, one was capable of placing said cheese on the animal in question. The actions that the animal took did not deter from the act of placing cheese, only the amount of time the cheese remained after being successfully placed. Therefore we must invalidate your answer and it remains that "nothing" is the correct reply. 

Srly, cheese is good yo.  




 But, tits are always good. 




 Because jb's sensitivities got butthurt.  




 oh. I wasnt.  




 Yea thats slightly different too 




 You'll remember this once in a lifetime experience forever! 




 It was over the top horrible that it was actually ok. I think the first one was trying to go for that, they just never admitted it.  




 "Nah but like if you smile more you will eventually be happy. Just fakr it until you make it, ya know?" 




 Taylor swift? 




 They transport and provide some basic care of they are capable with the equipment they have.  




 Nuggers? 




 Frictionqt 




 Yumm 




 Yea, the swiss might be able to do something. But normal people that watch games and support them could do the most by educating themselfes on what is actually happening.  




 Slightly different 




 When I got to sea I assumed quay was pronounced qwee and had to go back and re read that block correctly.  




 Yea we need time for porn too 




 Except doing something I dont understand immediately so it makes me uncomfortable and well, goddamn this is america and we cant have that.  




 Some say it made his hole weak, wait..

Wrong joke.  




 Yea yea, everyone sucks at driving but you, another sentiment reddit shares.  




 Thanks man, you too :) 




 Im not taking anything away from you, im just stating what our machine intellegence can reliably do at this point in time.  If you are so insecure you think any ol reddit comment is a personal attack on your driving ability then IDK what to tell you bud.  




 None. The human aspect messes it up. But being such a human thing, we need to make the best of it and try to change our governments for the good in the best ways we are able. 

Every form of government works with the right checks and controls, with the right people,  and in the right time. 

There is no "best" government, not because they are all bad, but because they are all good in the right circumstance. 

We can find perfect governments on paper that fail in real life and we can find terrible things on paper that work in real life. And of course, we can find anecdotes that support either cause. Socialism can work in real life the same way that capitalistic democracies can fail in real life. Humans are too unpredictable to choose a "best" government and so each instantiation of each form of government should be treated individually as its own case, not with these blanket statements. 

Theres a reason this is its own (large) field of study. It wouldnt be if it really could be summed up in a single reddit rant.  




 Is this ladybugging you?  




 Im covered in bees! 




 My motivation is to do better than my parents and make them proud of me. They are both immigrants and struggled to raise my sister and I. I want to take advantage of all the opportunities I have and all the work they have already done for me so that I can be in a position to help them when it comes time for that. I want to finish college and get a good job so that I can get things they never had and share with them. my motivition is to thank them wity more than words.  




 Just like reddit! 




 The movie Click 




 Dude BC ftw 




 I'm covered in bees! 




 Well there mr grumpy pants, not with that attitude. Now put on your happy pants and lets tinkle! 




 Except for the farts 









 I have dabbled there. 




 Dat wiggle doe, still made my day.  









 Oh I see it now,  I'll try that next time.  




 But who was the first pic? 




 Not completely,  a lot of driving is predictable paths in good conditions. Rain and snow and unpredictability of other humans is what robots have trouble with, and that isnt all of driving.  




 Isnt that ben heck? His channel is random gaming stuff right? 




 /r/onetruegod 




 Dat asian lady cant make up her mind doe 




 Oh, I didnt know that.  




 Your body plays with legos. And it has a set of plans for legos called dna. Well, every now and then it will rebuild a part of you to keep you up to date. But sometimes it accidentally copies something wrong. Scientists call that a mutation. Sometimes that mutation will grow uncontrollably and do some nasty stuff like take resources fron the good cells. 

This does really bad things to your body. 

Thats the best eli5 I got and disclaimer that I am not a scientist.  




 Mmm, metroid larva.  

 




 What my sister and I did was we made fake notes and they had the other's phone number as the office's number. So when I would get a call, I would oretend to be Dr. Ramos's assistant and go through our records and then confirm that, yes, indeed /u/test_subject2027's sister was here yesterday.  




 Like I would tell you 




 We did it reddit, arrest him! 




 Dat fit doe 




 The finger is over extending to lift the hotpocket. Plus, it takes you out of the game for a second. If we can add a small motor and have it automatically raise up when the hotpocket is too low, then this could revolutionize the world.  




 The turtle is a metaphor for cheating 









 They did high res 3d imaging so it really is exactly how they move 




 Yea the colour is shifted 




 The video said "the researchers captured the footage through high-resolution 3D time-lapse multi-colour imaging, making use of both spinning disk confocal microscopy and lattice light sheet microscopy. These techniques involves capturing slices through an object and stitching them together to provide final 3D images across the whole cell."

TLDR:  No
