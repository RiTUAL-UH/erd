 Amid the celebration and controversy of the release of the long dormant Go Set a Watchman, it seems fitting to pay tribute again to Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man  a masterwork, that with To Kill a Mockingbird, form bookends to a shelf of American literature. Like Harper Lee, Ralph Ellison was a child of the American South, though he observed from the opposite side of our racial chasm. In parallel with Lee, Ellison found a well-deserved critical acclaim with a first published novel, and then turned away from writing fiction  like her, he might have consumed too much of himself in creating a masterpiece. Only with his death did his estate published a version of his second, unfinished novel, to meet with a doubtful reception.
I found Invisible Man as pristine, paperback edition, for sale at my local library. Having seen it included on the lists of essential novels, I obtained it for the suggested donation of a dollar. It has proved a revelation. It is personal but universal testament of how petty ambition and cynical, political expediency can corrupt any noble cause. Ellisons well-turned prose spans from lyrical, bucolic scenes to lurid episodes that seem lifted from gothic horror. While I cannot speak for the Black American experience, I found that its sharply drawn characters and plot turns still resonate into these troubled times, more than two generations after its publication. Does anyone wish to share impressions of this great novel?
 









 Saudi Arabia also burns oil for electrical generation.
They have drained their aquifers empty for such vanity projects as growing wheat in the desert.
Maintaining production in their aging oil fields now requires a massive injection of water, to tease oil from the source rock. Does anyone with a petroleum back ground know the source of this water? Is it saltwater or fresh?
  




 Or, they move only to survive. Some were driven from the farm by Malthusian pressure. Some were coerced outright, by eviction from their smallholdings by landlords, who could put the land to a more profitable use -- the Enclosure movement in Britain, for example. Market forces drove a lot of people to the factories, as mechanization undermined the handcrafts and traditional farming. Consider the steady disappearance of the family farm or union worker in this country, or the fate of the owner of a taxi medallion with the appearance of Uber. While the historical trajectory of capitalism has been to greatly increase the stock of goods in the aggregate, whole sectors of the population have often suffered sharply diminished returns. Of course, that is what civilization has always been -- a constant class struggle bumping along a Malthusian path. A more equitable society may not be possible, but we should not idealize the process.     




 Yes, a perpetual expansion into space seems to be the only alternative to entropic collapse, whether for human or robot. It is of interest that Ray Kurzweil believes that we must be the only (or at least, the most advanced) intelligence in this galaxy. He reasons that if an equivalent intelligence arose anywhere else in the past few million years, it would have evolved its own Singularity, and this technology would have already filled the galaxy. He does not consider the opposing possibility -- that the appearance of a Singularity always destroys its host, and for this reason, we seem to be alone. 




 The first problem is defining fascism. It is applied to a spectrum of disorders, from ultra-conservative radicals like Franco to the explicitly revolutionary, of which the Nazis were the prime example. They certainly were not conservatives, in any conception of the term. True, the Fascists rose in response to the failure of capitalism, but while vulgar Marxist analysis consider the Nazis to be the mere handmaidens of capitalists, recent scholarship is placing them in fundamental opposition to it. Under their regime, private ownership of capital was only nominal and retained as an expediency. It is certainly a greater canard to compare the Fascists with the non-communist Left, as a central tenet of those movements is toward a universal equality. My view is that the true political form of capitalism is liberalism -- the rule of law protecting individuals pursuits in a free market -- and this is incompatible with goals of Fascism. 




 The best formulation of Fascism is as neither Left or Right. The concept of a political party organized on military lines followed the Bolshevik model. As with the Communists, extreme violence was its ultimate political method, but the Fascists tolerated capitalists (and aristocrats) to the extent they were useful to their nationalist aims. The Nazis created an impressive welfare state to win the loyalty of the population, with class conflict rejected in favor of racial theory -- this became the basis for both social equality and exclusion. While National Socialism was in many ways unique, it is important to remember that its goals were not dissimilar from some of its capitalist, liberal contemporaries -- what Belgium did in the Congo, Nazis sought to accomplish in Eastern Europe,
