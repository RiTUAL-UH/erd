 It went well actually. The doc wasn't a psychiatrist or anything but she referred me to a psychiatrist and a psychologist she recommends. I think the anticipation with that sort of thing is way worse than when your actually with them. However, because it was only a GP, I didn't go into much detail about the anxiety, I just told her about it in general. So I feel more nervous about the psychiatrist and psychologist :O 




 Oh no :( what happened at yours?  




 Sitting in waiting room. I'm scared for what to say, how to sum up how I've been feeling for the last few years in a 15 minute appointment :/  




 "Don't let perfection destroy the good". I sometimes have to tell myself this. I might be on the verge of giving something up because I know it won't or can't be perfect. This is wrong. You can't let the idea of perfection stop you from doing any good just because it isn't perfect. If you always thought like this, you would never get anything done or make any progress. 




 Yeah I'd like to read The Dark Tower series. I'm put off by how long it is though. I mean it's almost impossible to write a series that long and not have it drop off in quality at some point. Is this true or is the whole series good? 




 Oh boy was that a good book. Laws yes. A few points I'd like to make:

1. Character development was absolutely phenomenal. I read the uncut edition so I don't actually know how much was added in but I felt the character development, especially in characters like Stu and Larry was fantastic. 

2. The bits towards the end with Tom and Stu literally had me tearing up. The Christmas day singing :'(. By that point I realised my heart was just invested in these characters. 

3. Once the mystery of the dark man was lost I felt like the story kinda lost something. It's like in Lost, once the mystery of the Island gets figured out, it's no longer that spooky which is why I'd say season 1 is the best. In The Stand, Randall Flagg only really stays spooky until he becomes an actual antagonist. When King starts writing in his perspective, although it does give us a lot more insight and story in the west, I feel like it detracted from the kinda mystery elements of the dark man. 

4. Ending was kinda predictable but thats not necessarily a bad thing. However I didn't like how the nuke exploded. 

Overall though I loved this book for character development alone. It's so bloody long that when characters die it literally is like "holy shit". That was the first King book I read, where do I go from here? :) 




 This is really nice thanks for posting :)  




 Thanks so much for the effort you put in to respond. It's really nice knowing that there's other people dealing with the same shit. I really agree with your point on honesty being key and I've always wanted to tell my family completely honestly what I'm going through. They know about the anxiety part but I've never explained the root of the anxiety as obviously it's a lot more embarrassing. How do you think I could tackle this problem?  




 So this is a long story and it might be a long post but I need to talk about it. 

Okay, so I am a young dude, 19 years old. Last August I was in Amsterdam and on a drunk night out I ended up having protected sex with a prostitute. The next day I literally felt unbearably ashamed and scared for my life. I was terrified I had contracted HIV from a silly mistake I made when drunk. I started fixating on symptoms and around a month later I had a really bad fever, a classic symptom of the disease. After the three month window period for hiv to show up in your blood stream I immediately got tested. Just before Christmas my results came back and I was so relieved. 

Soon later at a new year party for 2015, I got blackout drunk and ended up wondering the street. I hardly remember anything except trying to talk to girls and people on the street. The next day I woke up and got the strange feeling that the night before I had made an active decision to infect myself and asked someone to inject me with it or something. Despite it being irrational and completely ridiculous, I just had this feeling of dread like i made an awful decision to infect myself. Another 3 or 4 months passed and I had developed a white tongue with a red patch towards the back, I googled it and it was another symptom of hiv. I got tested and was convinced that I was gonna die. 

But before my results arrived through text message I went travelling to Thailand with my friend, the beginning of the trip was absolutely awful as I was completely convinced I had the disease. On another drunken night in Bangkok I decided to visit a massage parlour with the obvious intention of receiving a handjob. The driver of my cab ended up taking me to a brothel and I thought fuck it. I've had a terrible night and all I want is a handjob not sex. So I went into a room with the girl and she told me to use a condom and I told her this was unnecessary because I didn't want sex. She kinda just got naked and rubbed herself on me giving me a kinda body massage and then ending the session with the handjob. The next day I didn't think much of it. I told myself that I only received a handjob and you can't get hiv from that. A few days later I got my text message from my previous std text and it said I was negative for everything. I felt absolutely incredible and started crying. I actually was fine despite convincing myself I was infected. This feeling lasted about 2 days before I started remembering and fixating on the night with the prostitute in Thailand. This girl was high risk and I remembered that at one point in the massage she tried to give me oral sex, I remember quickly grabbing her head and lifted it up but I'm pretty sure her mouth might have touched the head of my penis. I started googling symptoms again and saw rash, fever etc.... About 2 weeks later I started convincing myself I was gonna get a rash, I stared at my arms all the time and convinced myself I had rashes. Then I took off my shirt to change t shirt and funnily enough there was a rash on my chest, this is a common place for people to get rashes after hiv infection. I pretty much accepted that I had it and my life was over. I ran home and lay in bed all night trying to stop a panic attack, the next day I woke up and the rash was gone. I was so happy because hiv rashes usually last longer. So I was kinda feeling okay for a bit but still worrying about it all the time. Two weeks later I got huge glands and a sore throat, more symptoms of hiv. It made me incredibly depressed and it lasted around 5 days. Since then it has been another 2 weeks and I have kept telling myself " at least I never got a fever, that's the most common symptom". And now for about 2 days I've developed large painful glands again and am getting shivery and hot at night. I told myself it's because I've been drinking and partying too often recently but I'm not sure. 

I've never felt so bad and ashamed in my life. I don't know why I put myself in situations related to my worst fear but what's happened has happened. I just feel like I will be a tragedy no matter what. I will upset my family and end up terminally ill or something. These are literally my worst fears and I just wanted to write them down, I would be surprised if anyone reads this but if you did, thanks and I hope you have a great day! :)

 You gotta start practicing again. Do small things but most importantly just stop giving a shit what people think of you or whether they will think of you negatively. Say what you want. Be who you wanna be and if thats someone who is brave then do it.
