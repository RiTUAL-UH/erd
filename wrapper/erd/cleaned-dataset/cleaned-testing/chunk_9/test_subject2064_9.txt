 Did she buy her paper towels in a cardboard box? Where is Barbie living nowadays, Canada?

 You look like Amy Lee's lost sister. Don't change a thing. You're beautiful just the way you are.  




 My only criticism is, i would make the 4 parts on the outside come out a little smoother. They seem to stop rather abruptly. 




 You don't believe which exists? Rape or performance anxiety? 




 Why are you asking? 




 Yes. There are other ways men are forced into intercourse, outside of the use of drugs. 




 Well, that is what I just said. To my knowledge, yes. However, the person ingesting the drugs should be aware of what they are introducing into their body, and the effects it will have. 




 With the use of drugs, yes. However I am not a doctor, nor do I recommend the use of such drugs against the users will.  




 You're making a generalization that every man is the same. Which is completely untrue. Most cases of rape where the victim is a male involve drugs, where blood is rushed to the penis, causing it to become erect, regardless of their mental state.
