 but...  would you actually put a ketchup product/mix on properly smoked meat?  I cant imagine any ketchup being anywhere near it. 




 For a lot of people that dont have access to smokers - this is the only way to get a smokey flavor.  Ketchup is a table sauce.  Barbecue is a marinade or basting sauce used in cooking.

 His claim is that solar energy is established enough that is attracts private financing - so it doesn't need government investments.  He says he wants to see the CEFC invest in new/emerging technologies instead.

I'm an American, so I dont know much beyond that.  Most articles I have read pretty much portray him as a bit of an asshole.  My paraphrasing of his CEFC ideals comes from this:

 Potentially, but honestly, not in my experience in *recent* years.  Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon can fight quite well for their stream and maintain HD if they have enough room in the channel.  Something as tight as what I was replying to though, would likely not work.

As an example, with my 20m downstream, I dont have to throttle my torrenting if I have a single HD stream going.  YMMV. 









 How can she flip?! 




 context dude.  continue reading from right were you stopped your copypasta. 




 Iit isn't a new concept.  Consider the TOW missile; now think of it in the water.  They have had these (air and water, wired-guided missiles/torpedos) for decades. 




 Thats not gonna work for OPs desire to stream and download simultaneously.  Unthrottled torrenting will kill an HD stream at that speed. 




 What he is really referring to is latency.  A wireless connection will almost always have greater latency.  Latency can hurt the quality of streaming services.

edit: I challenge the downvoters of this.  "www" is simply a name, not a necessity.  Nothing has "changed" in the past 30+ years of the existence of the world wide web.  It's simply a choice - albeit one that more websites owners used to respect.

 I have no substantiated idea.

That said, my belief leans toward food processing and/or pesticides.  "Organic" food definitely gives me less, if no, noticeable/quantifiable reactions.

What has been a recurring indicator for this, in my experience, is nuts, seeds, and seeded fruits.  If I buy cheap stuff I likely will have allergic reaction that turns into acne.  If I buy better (i.e. organic) stuff, its much less likely to happen - if at all.

My food allergy is tied with acne breakouts, so I can see/feel/itch direct correlations between these things when I eat them.  I will itch within hours, and breakouts will follow.  I really cannot say how this compares to others. 




 Whenever I see these (OP's) posts, I want to respond with the same schpiel, but I dont want to be a Debbie-downer.  But you are absolutely right, and I hope OP knows the drill. 




 That's not true to the modern definition of the word, which broadens the scope to almost any controlling body/organization that can limit the dissemination of materials to the masses. 

I'm referring specifically to childporn, which boggles my mind as to why it repeatedly comes up in censorship-related discussion. 




 I would agree that diet influences acne.  I first noticed this ~20 years ago when I started to travel for work.  I have observed the following over the years:

1. Food in the US gives me more acne problems than any other country.
2. Food from grocery stores in major cities gives me more acne problems. Smaller rural/self-sufficient farming areas give me less acne problems for the same kinds of foods I would eat in an urban/industrial environment.

I stand by the assertion that its food, and not pollution, because I know (have been tested) my acne is food-allergy driven. 




 Stain-less.  Not stain-proof. 




 is it censorship when you block things that are outright illegal?

 For serious.  I mean, lots of cool posts - but they are getting more and more off-topic for this sub.

 In my experience, CA freeways have larger lanes than other municipalities.  At least it feels that way to me.

Source:  I am a CA resident that has live in 4 other states, and driven across the country multiple times.  To me, California freeways are amazing.

However, I disagree with you that just because it feels better than what you are used to - that makes it safe. 




 Re-read what you just said, while recalling the contents of the video.

If he was on the shoulder, the cop would have cited him for it.  The rider said that he was in the lane; which in this context of a motorcycle passing cars is called "lane-splitting".

Watching for motorcycles on your right is more dangerous than on your left, as a vehicle passenger-side mirror (typically) makes the image smaller.  A motorcycle is difficult enough to distinguish in heavy traffic.

To answer your question, AFAIK the motorcycle would be at fault.  Lane-splitting isn't technically "legal".  Its just something that CHP turns a blind-eye to.  But they do not declare it as a legal/valid thing for motorcycles to do, and so it does not have any right-of-way privs, etc.

 I *think* its a freakin' huge party that you throw for your daughter when she comes of age for sexing. 

Source: I live in a heavily Mexican populated neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, and this is my loose interpretation of what I see/hear going on around me *every f'ing weekend*.

Wikipedia offers this expanded [explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincea%C3%B1era):

 Quinceaera (pronounced: [knsee]; feminine form of "fifteen-year-old"), also called fiesta de quince aos, fiesta de quinceaera, quince aos or simply quince, is the celebration of a girl's fifteenth birthday in parts of Latin America and elsewhere in communities of people from Latin America. This birthday is celebrated differently from any other as it marks the transition from childhood to young womanhood. Latin myths and tradition tell about how girls were prepared to be married by the age of fifteen; in the years prior to their fifteenth birthdays, girls were taught to cook, weave, and about child rearing by the elder women in their communities in preparation for their lives as married women. Although it is agreed that the traditions of quinceaeras originated in ancient Aztec culture, the celebrations today vary significantly across countries; celebrations in some countries, for example, have taken on more religious overtones than in others.

 Have you seen Haywire? 




 #Gina Carano

If you have any doubts, watch the movie [Haywire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1506999/).  Sure, she's done some crap, but Haywire is a good movie, has a great supporting cast, and was directed by a good director. 




 I cant argue with your statement, but when I look upon low-rent areas compared to high-rent areas, I do have to wonder about percentiles.

 The most WTF thing about this is *why the fuck* I'm still being subjected to facebook posts when I deleted my facebook account years ago.

A wtf post should stand on its own.  I dont give a fuck if it came from your facebook feed. 




 To be fair, since the new update, I initially saw the box ad (3) times after the last update took place.  It has since disappeared, and I haven't seen an ad since.  There is no empty placemark for the ad or anything - the menu has collapsed/compressed back into place.

I have all of the privacy/ad-related options in the system settings turned off, so I'm considering chalking this up as being a glitch.  I never saw ads before when there was an initial outcry. 




 Thats really not necessarily true.  I already have Roku's, and have had them for years.  The ease of use on my Samsung smart TV is awesome, and I prefer it from having to switch over to a Roku.  YMMV

 Yea, I'm generalizing - not knit-picking this pic in particular.  I already gave a recent example (within the past month at Glacier Point) were the use of a drone was very disruptive at a public place. 




 I had never heard of this guy until recently, and I'm not promoting him - I'm just impressed that he did this:

 The Sanders administration [when mayor of Burlington, VT] also "sued the local cable franchise and won reduced rates for customers."

I saw The Daily Show make fun of him a few weeks back, and the guy did seem kinda bat-shit crazy:

 I dont have any issues with this update, but skins/paint on weapons  bother me because people take advantage to make them look like things they are not.  Particularly in terms of light/glow effects to make it look like a weapon is charged when its not. 




 I'm torn, but I'm seriously tempted to buy some sort of gun (bb maybe?) to shoot these fucking things down.

Footage like this looks really cool until you are outside somewhere trying to enjoy the scenery/view/etc, and some jackass is buzzing around with one of these things.  These things are not quiet.  They are just like other powerful RC devices: *they are loud*. 

I had the displeasure of having to deal with a jackass up on Glacier Point (Yosemite National Park) who was running one of these things back and forth along the cliffs edge getting footage of himself standing there.
