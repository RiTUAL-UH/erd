 I think it's a part of the VIET events thing. I know it's part of HIP, I've gotten it before while playing it, but it must also be a part of Lux Invicta, as that's what OP's playing. 




 Man, I'm very engrossed in this so far, how long do you think it'll take for the next chapter? Sorry, I just need my fix o_o 




 thank mr skeltal 




 I actually like this band, but goddammit if they don't go over-cringe sometimes 




 Nothing makes any sence here 









 I honestly think you'd have to TRY to get it these days. 




 How the fuck did he get Bonzi Buddy? That thing's been extinct since like, the 2000's 




 Doesn't make sexist jokes

Men are garbage

Huh. 




 Not sure if Africa, or Detroit. 




 Because it's "empowering" 




 Am I the only one who thinks this might not be weird? Probably is going to something they can't declare as part of their expenditures (Area 51). 




 I've made about 20$ so far and I've been on for 3 days. I believe the most I've made is 7$ on my second day. 




 Link?

 they were making fun of it in the original thread 









 Because it's an extremely deep RPG with 100's of hours of gameplay. And with the DLC it's even better. Its also got many memorable characters and a very interesting story. 




 ...With his horrible smell. 




 Sorry I can't help you, but I'd like to point out this is the first post here in over 5 month. This sub seems kinda dead :\ 




 This pretty much sums up anything I'd try to say. The problems I'm experiencing (and apparently the rest of the community is too) are so ubiquitous that I'd have to open 100's of tickets and most of those wouldn't result in me getting what I was supposed to. 




 Time for some good old fashioned extermination of natives! :D  




 Medieval people actually had a pretty good idea of what the world looked like (except for America and the Pacific) so the only new stuff you'd show them is stuff you wouldn't be able to back up. (Many people claimed there were America-like continents west of Europe) 




 For simplicity's sake let's assume they can understand your modern language and have a basic knowledge of mathematics (elementary school level) 









 Would you mind explaining to me what the ticker is? I don't get it :\ 




 Interesting. I just checked out instantGC and it seem way more legit. I just cashed out of swag bucks (with a cool 20$) and I think I'm gonna move myself over there. 




 Do you think it's worth it to just stop doing the offers and only use the more passive feature/surveys? 




 For some reason, despite the fact I do tons of offers (I'd estimate If I actually got all the Swagbucks they said I would get then I'd have something like 2000 more swag bucks), none of them seem to actually give me swagbucks. For instance, I go to the offers page click on something that says (roughly) "Sign up for X brand gift card!" - 50 SB. I follow the link, signup for the card and provide all my information, and then do a ton of surveys before getting to the end, checking my balance and 90% not seeing it change. Is there a reason? Is anyone else experiencing this? Sorry if this is kinda ranty but it really frustrates me. 




 They said it should be on the app store as soon as the conference is over (right now). Sadly no Android :( 




 Yep, sucks for us android users :\ 




 I'm sorry, I understand the pain. 




 DAMN STRAIGHT 




 Yep 









 Maybe an event that fires a hundred or so years after the  initial invasion where the Inca go to war with the Aztec's over in the Americas, this diverts a large amount of European levies to America and allows for European countries to strike back and regain lost ground. (Basically it just nukes their levies for a few years) This could occur repeatedly until the Aztec are knocked all the way out of Europe. 




 I don't think we'd have to worry about the Canadians. They use paintball guns. 




 Sadly this isn't illegal as it isn't real people, and only has *drawn* depictions of minors. Should really still be illegal though. 




 [BANNED] 









 It's never going to end. Perhaps the fats may have won today. But remember, my fit brothers and sisters, WE'LL AT LEAST LIVE A HELLUVA LONGER THAN THE HAMS.
