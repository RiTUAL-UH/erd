 Springsteen live is the best thing I've ever seen, and I've seen some amazing shows. I keep talking him up haha. 




 At least not Bud Black. 




 He's not as quick as Kemba at all, but Jerian has a chance to be a really nice player 




 "The data generally suggests the role of clutch hitting is limited if it exists at all" did you read that part? Certainly seems to be at least strongly hinting that clutch isn't a thing.

The one quote that I think says what you're saying it says is the second one. Which I've agreed with this whole time. I'm more than willing to believe in clutch, if the evidence is there. I'd even like to believe in clutch. But thus far, the evidence has suggested that there is no consistent trend of clutchness even within a season, much less over multiple seasons. See the studies that were cited at the beginning of the article.

The reason they are saying there is no such thing as a clutch hitter is because it is nigh upon impossible to definitively prove that something does not exist. They have not proved that there is no such thing as clutch, but they certainly haven't proven that it does exist.

Which doesn't really square with your final point, that "there's no way [I] can't tell [you] guys like Jeter or Arod haven't been consistently clutch throughout their careers". That's exactly what I'm saying. Those guys haven't been consistently clutch throughout their careers. Their performances in high-leverage situations are within the expected variances from their career averages in all situations. 




 It says what I told you it says haha, that there is no convincing evidence for clutchness. Show me a quote, within the context of the article, that shows evidence for clutch being a thing. 




 I did, as soon as you replied, because I was flabbergasted. It does not say that. 




 Where are you getting that from the article? Dude that is some serious selective reading. 




 I'm being pedantic? You have given literally zero evidence that such a phenomenon exists, other than cherrypicked anecdotes...which I suppose puts you on the cutting edge of clutch apologists, so congrats on that.

If you just haven't read the stuff, by all means, here's a good place to start: http://www.fangraphs.com/library/considering-high-leverage-performance-and-clutch-hitting/

But, I can't convince you of anything if you're not willing to be convinced. 




 Hitting with RISP in general is a crapshoot. Where is the evidence, other than anecdotal, that those guys come up time and time again, in a statistically relevant sample size? 




 Okay, well I suppose you believe in clutch then. Show me some evidence of that and I'll be happy to admit I'm wrong. Until then, I'm gonna go with the body of evidence that shows that clutch doesn't exist. 




 No one is stepping into this pit of vipers. 




 Aaaaand it's done. https://twitter.com/Alden_Gonzalez/status/616319064818847744 




 Fuck everything. 




 Hahaha nailed it 




 I'm trying to decide right now if La Jolla is Fantasyland or Tomorrowland. 




 Yeah that's what I mean by don't disbelieve. Just because the info can't be verified on an anonymous internet forum doesn't mean it's not accurate. Like you said, stuff does break on here every so often. Just like my heart right now. 




 Agreed with everything you said until bulldozed in the playoffs. We lost 2 games in extras, and went 1 for 22 with RISP for the series. That's staggeringly unlucky, and it's confirmation bias at its finest to say we got whooped. 




 If you want to see the scene with all the drunk pirates from the end of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, just come join us in PB! (I live in SD too) 




 Technically true, but don't do it while you're driving lol 




 You should probably be taking the 5 to Disneyland anyway, from which you can't see the Big A.

The price of this advice will be you never starting Sonny Gray against us again. 




 ELI5 Scioscia and DiPoto disagree with how the team should be run. Scoiscia is old school, DiPoto is new school, and DiPoto can't get any of the coaches to listen to his scouting reports, so he resigned. 




 I don't believe you, but I don't disbelieve you either if that makes sense. Just foolish to trust the internet. I'm on pins and needles here 




 It's Chris Sale 




 Can you provide a source on that? 




 Orioles 




 I said almost dammit 




 I don't think it's nearly the knockout blow you were hoping for haha. Where it screws us is down the road, constructing the roster going forward. This team, as currently constructed, still has a chance to be pretty good. 




 I think the ideal is that they find a way to keep working together. But if that's what it takes, then yeah, keep JeDi and get rid of Scioscia. 




 He got traded because Sosh didn't like his defense behind the plate. So he went to Toronto with Juan Rivera for Vernon Wells...yeah that worked out great. And we started Jeff Mathis behind the dish instead. 




 If Arte can pull this off I will almost forgive him for everything else 




 Because we liked him and Sosh traded him and ever since then he's killed us every time we play him so yeah. 




  he'll throw that speedball by ya, make you look like a fool, boy

That made me grin real big 




 No no no no no no no no no no no 




 Yes. So Baldoquin better be good. 




 Seriously, this trade was a steal as soon as it was made. Two young pitchers with upside and years of team control remaining for an outfielder whose career OBP was under .300 at the time of the deal, and has only one plus tool (power). It's only going to look better as time goes on.

For a nice evaluation of Trumbo currently, look at the return the Dbacks got for him from Seattle. He went over with Vidal Nuno (a decently-high-upside long reliever), and back came Welington Castillo (a catcher who had only gotten 25 ABs), Dominic Leone (a relief pitcher who was good last year but had an ERA over 6 for Seattle), and two minor leaguers who project as a maybe-everyday-player and a utility player.

Would you trade Santiago and Skaggs for a backup catcher with no bat, a struggling reliever, and two decent AA guys? I hope not. We killed it in this trade. 




 Pirates 




 I don't know, the way we handled Josh's situation made me think about it. 




 There's people in the college game who we look at as physical monsters, who are able to assert absolute physical dominance at the college level, simply because they are upperclassmen who are grown ass men now. Not very many of these guys make an impact in the NBA; much of their effectiveness in college is in their physicality.

Now take someone who's actually good enough to be in the NBA, and is a contributor, and on top of that is fully mature physically, and works out for a living.

95% of NBA starters would be able to drag an awful team to the tournament. If they land on a team like Seattle or Florida Gulf Coast, as was suggested, they'd be in title contention. I love college hoops, but there's some serious overestimation of the college game in here right now. 




 No opinion about it, that's a fact. He could absolutely do it, and he'd be likely to.

 Yeah this isn't discrimination, I thought we were operating from that assumption already...kk enjoy the feel of tin foil on your scalp! 




 I think you're digging a little hard to find so-called examples of discrimination against males.

We live in a society that systemically favors men over women, dude. A lot of people couch this distinction in terms that makes it seem like you have no struggles because you're male, which is wrong.

But what is true is that there are a set of challenges you will never have to face or even potentially face, because you are a man and not a woman. That's what privilege is. 




 Angels 




 Let's go Shoe! Keep the ball down and you'll be golden 




 Sosh was a catcher as a player, and a very good one defensively. He's always had really high standards for catcher defense, and is unlikely to play a guy who's good offensively but mediocre defensively. Nap was a great offensive catcher, but not a strong defender, so Sosh always hesitated to give him too much playing time. That's why we dealt him, and he's bit us in the ass at every turn since. 




 It also helps that the bullpen threw 7 innings against us the day before, so he'd absolutely love to get a day of rest for them. But it still shows faith for sure 




 Bode Miller, skier at the Olympics. Yeah that was so bad, because it was apparent that the reporter was gonna badger him until she got a reaction. That made me feel so so bad for him.

EDIT Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIn3_g6sozM 




 I mean he was hurt, but yeah you're technically not wrong. 




 They left because while another year wouldn't have hurt them, it also wasn't going to help them. They wanted to start making money playing basketball, and staying in college wasn't going to improve their draft stock; if anything it was going to hurt it, what with them being another year older. I'm never gonna fault a guy for wanting to get paid to play.
 




 My guess is they worked something out with him beforehand to pay him less than the minimum first round contract, a la Josh Huestis with OKC last year. Lot of teams hate having end of the first round picks, cuz they're guaranteed millions but the quality of player isn't as high, so they try to work around it.

I don't like it, but I'd be surprised if this was anything else. 




 I don't think enough people understand how much money the military pumps into sports. It's an effective way for them to recruit, because they can tap into the machisimo and team-first attitudes of fandom. But it really is troubling to watch them co-opt it for the purpose of signing people up. 




 Not to detract from the seriousness of the conversation. But turdburglars. That's amazing. 




 Reds 




 Saw him pitch in Lake Elsinore a few weeks back! His stuff is electric, his control is where he needs to improve. He walked way too many people and got bounced early as a result, but man, the potential is tantalizing. 




 That trade is not even close to realistic.
 




 *De Profundis* really is worth reading, for the entirely different slant on his work that it provides. The careful consideration that takes place in *De Profundis*, the realizations that all come far too late for him, the issues on which he still feels resolute and those on which he feels he was wrong, all combine to make a powerful statement. It's fascinating stuff. 




 *The Broom of the System* by DFW is largely a failure on a literary level. It was written as a philosophy thesis, though. 




 In the NL there's a real possibility of it. But in the AL I don't think the Twins will hang around, at the minimum, so that's more of a stretch to me. 




 All ERA is, is the number of earned runs allowed divided by 9. That's it. You are not quoting different statistics when you bring up ERA and runs allowed. 




 Yankees 




 If the NBA could, they would raise the age limit to enter the league. The more years they see someone play, the less risk there is in drafting them (at least in theory). That's the reason the one-and-done rule even exists now, so that the teams don't have to draft players based only on their high school careers. It's too high of a risk for them, there were too many busts, so the one-and-done rule exists.  




 All three of those were the right call. Relax. 




 Yes, cuz there have been rematches before
 




 Yeah reading this through the next morning...they salty 




 Rest of the world is pretty into basketball. 




 Well that would be towards the low end of what I hope might be possible. The bottom line is, we really don't know. Hopefully, we can give women the opportunity in the next few decades, and we'll start to see what can or can't happen. 




 3 women on a roster is theoretically as many as 90 women in the majors at once. I'd say that's even more than I'd hope for. 




 Depends on how you define waves. Hundreds? Unlikely. Tens? Possible. I certainly want the opportunity afforded to women, on equal footing. 




 Well yes, on a larger scale, but it certainly isn't helping that historically, women have never really been afforded to play baseball at a serious level. The optimists, like me, think that there's a good chance there have been women/will be women capable of playing with the boys at that level, and they have just historically not been afforded that opportunity. 




 In an ideal world? Increased access to the game and young women playing it growing up, will give them a shot at it. But mostly:

 Hopefully

 




 Yes, take it literally and not as a metaphor

EDIT: seriously, it's just meant to illustrate the idea that a milestone that is easier to reach is still a milestone 




 If we cheer for a man who lands on the Moon, and only the Moon, isn't that symbolic of the fact that nobody believes we'll ever put a human on Mars? 




 I take the other view. Hopefully, when a woman makes it to the majors and gets her first hit, that's only the start of a wave of women who can play. No downside to be had here. 




 Mariners. I will never pick Joe Blanton haha. 




 Johnny Mac! Love that dude. 




 Who the fuck down voted you for that? 




 Hell yeah it did! Ltbu! 




 Can you guys like, throw Sonny against other teams too? I feel like we see him every time we play you guys. 




 I think I can get on board with could use improvement. I'm personally a big fan of teams that play like that too. I think Sosh is capable of that, but he could do better for sure. He tends to be a hands-off guy, and when the players are fun guys, he lets them be them. I think the team is kinda pressing under expectations right now; we'll see how Sosh responds to that, what buttons he pushes. Here's hoping! 




  Upvoting an Angels fan... This feels dirty

But but. I like you guys :(  




 I particularly enjoy *Into the Wild* and *Fear and Loathing* out of those, but don't be afraid to try lots of different stuff! 




 I think I probably used wording that was a bit too strong when I said "to a T". I also think you make a good point regarding his hesitancy to give young guys at bats; if I had anything to change about his style, it would be that. But I also think he deserves credit for working guys like Kole into the lineup quickly.

Ultimately, I spoke a little too strongly about his team management. I do believe that he does a good job getting out of the way of the team, and promoting an atmosphere that allows them to handle the clubhouse as they see fit. Lately, we've had players on our roster who prefer to go about their business individually, and we've seen that on the roster. But it's been far from a toxic environment. 




 A good number of the movies you listed are based on books. *Fight Club*, *Into the Wild*, *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas*, *American Psycho*, *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*. Check out those books, or other works by the authors who wrote them. Can't be a bad place to start, there's some real good ones in there. 




 *The Devil in the White City* by Erik Larson. Story of a serial killer threaded in with the story of the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893. Fascinating stuff. 




 Dude. It's really easy to get people to go outside in San Diego. Especially when they can drink beer. 

Source: Am San Diegan. 




 And that's a major problem 




 Angels. Homer pick, can't go against em. 




 Yeah I've seen it, was just referencing the "no desire to improve" bit 




 You definitely have to really want it. It helps if you've graduated at that point, because you always have that to fall back on. 




 Fair enough. Upton just had like blaring warning signs. His only batting stat that wasn't getting significantly worse was dingers, and then those left too. 









 Yeah it's Matt Joyce. As much as I want to like him, he's stressing so hard at the plate
