 When the kids left home, I took the empty nest thing pretty literally. I love animals and Id always wanted a parrot, but really had never had the time.  I dont use euphemisms like no longer with us so Ill just say it: my husband is dead.  Heart attack five years ago.  After working two teenagers through that sort of loss, and myself as well, I cant say I ever had much me time.  When the kids left, I felt a kind of freedom I hadnt had since I was eighteen years old and just on the verge of independence.  I was almost giddy the day I went to buy Henry. 

Henry was a beautiful yellow naped amazon.  He loved to talk and picked up words so quickly that at times it was almost scary.  He heard me on the phone once.  Okay, Linda, thanks for calling whats that?...  Oh of course!...  haha!...  Alright, bye Linda!  Bye Linda! Henry called out.  Henry!  Clever boy!  Do I really sound like that?  Henry was just that good, he could pick a phrase up after hearing it only once and he could mimic the oddest noises almost perfectly.  But since he was an old man of thirty, pretty much birdy middle aged when I bought him from a lovely young couple, it could also be confusing trying to determine if some things were from his old life, or from around my own house.  

My keyboard, for instance.  Id never played it for him, but there was one specific beat he was always mimicking that I had never heard on any other keyboard.  Mine was so old, the beat was pretty much a relic that had been replaced by something cooler on new models.  I was certain I hadnt played it, but where else would he have picked it up?  There were other noises that made sense, but also could not really be explained.  The sound of footsteps going up my stairs like someone was running.  I know the sound of my stairs and even for non-vocal sounds, Henry was a perfect mimic.  I know the sound of someone running up those stairs from twenty-some years of kids flying up and down.  But I hadnt run up those stairs in years.

Henry kept up with the strange noises.  The attic door being pulled down had a specific thump and creak that was very distinct.  I hadnt been up there in at least a year.  Songs from music boxes I absolutely had not played since getting Henry were some of his favourites.  Whats more, Henry sometimes made voices that I could swear I heard at the market or on the bus, but that he could never have picked up.  Certainly not at my house.  

It all came to a head after coming home once to find a cigarette still burning in an ash tray on my coffee table.  I finally pieced together what was going on, and I was terrified.  I felt crazy just thinking it, but I knew: someone was in my house with me.  They had played my keyboard while I was away, they had run up the stairs when they knew I was coming and hid in the attic.  Im not crazy, these things happen.  Ive seen it on the news.  I called the police immediately.

After a thorough inspection of the house, the police verified my suspicion.  There was almost a nest up in my attic where someone had been squatting, for a while from the looks of it.  No person was found, they figured hed been lucky enough to slip out at just the right time.  Change your locks, maybe get a security system installed was cold comfort from the police.  Call us again if you see anything unusual.

Things changed after that.  Especially with Henry.  I couldnt stand him making those noises.  Every time he made the attic door sound, my heart raced.  I was nervous enough as it was and Henry was giving me panic attacks on a regular basis.  I couldnt keep him.  I asked the couple who had sold him to me whether they could take him again.  I didnt need my money back, I just wanted him to go to a good home.  To my relief, they were happy to take him off my hands and we arranged a pick-up date.

Im counting down to when my nest will empty again.  I woke up just a few hours ago to Henrys staircase running noise and attic thump.  Ugh, Henry, go back to sleep!  I called out.  He cant be gone too soon.  But wait, its Saturday, right?  And the pickup was Friday   
 




 nice twist!
