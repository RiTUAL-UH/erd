 Glad she's dealing with her addiction, but wow, what an odd looking couple.

Am I allowed to say that? 









 How so?

You can leave the building to smoke at any time. 




 ...but operating a black market gambling operation does  




 You didn't see through the hyperbole?

 Failing to declare income is a violation of the tax act.

Operating a near million dollar black market gambling book is illegal.

Calm down. 




 He's been doing it since the early 90's.

He made choices and now he's facing consequences for those choices.

What is it you dislike?

The police are holding him to account for the choices he made.

 




 So every cop who ever gets in trouble is guilty?

That's your standard? 




 I read the entire story.

He never once advised he was declaring the income to the IRS.

Even more damning, I now see he tweaked his suggestion, that on top of the winners, he recommended **all participants** gift him 10%.

If you think he was paying tax on his gambling operation, I've some swamp land in Florida I'd like to sell you.

I have a Japanese lilac tree, columbrian maple tree and a hybrid Apple tree + 3 pyramid cedars + 2 lilac bushes, one of which is a beautiful 10 feet tall.



That's plenty of oxygen.

My kids play at the park. 




 

Without chemical herbicides at my disposal in Ontario for low cost, I now accept that my lawn is going to go to hell and one day, I will simply have to completely landscape my front and back yards, as the lawn is going to turn into a pasture.

Water my lawn?  Ha-ha, no.
