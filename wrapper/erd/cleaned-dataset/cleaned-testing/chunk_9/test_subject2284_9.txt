 Ultimate Wolverine had a better 'regenerate from a single cell' healing factor. 




 It got rid of a lot of beloved characters/history, and allowed patchy writers free reign to rewrite the histories of beloved characters. Batman didn't actually have it too bad, other than the loss of the previous batgirls and said Mr Freeze retcon (although Mr Freeze still has about 20 years of stories with his old origin, so one can argue all that can be said was said) but other characters, like the Teen Titans, got hit pretty hard by the reboot. 




 It's a similar problem with a lot of batman villains. Because the majority aren't evil, but mentally ill, you can only go so many stories before the audience sympathy goes away or your forced to redeem them in some way, which may be why recent books lean towards either new villains or unrepentant murderers (Talia, Joker) 




 Just about to say this. My excitement for Kung Fury has somewhat been quenched by Danger 5 season 2. 




 I feel so bad I beat Ebrietas first time. 




 [Why not try both!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbq9yt3RxYs) 




 In the ninety page lore document posted a few weeks back, it's theorized that no only is she a great one, but she's also the maiden in Black from Demon souls, tying the games together. 




 Keanu Reeves is giving his best Nicholas Cage impression and I'm *Loving it* 




 They should have really done this with the last episode, since a major theme of it was 'You could've stopped a suicide by being a better friend and taking more phone calls' which is a pretty apalling message to give to kids with depression. 




 A lot of people speculated it was the leader of a covenant, too. 




 To be honest, RLM is almost always in line with the majority critical consensus, so it's not surprising you usually agree. 




 I think the majority of it is overblown because of that one return of kings guy. It's basically a presentation of extreme internet stupidity so journalists and twitter users can state their own opinions, and talk about the artificially manufactured 'controversy'. 




 Nah, Legend of the guardians:the owls of ga'hool was the safest movies about owl blood sport I've ever seen. 




 Because adult comedies aimed at girls is such an overused audience! Why are there so few action films aimed at heterosexual men? 




 And Mad Max was the first risk Hollywood has taken since Cleopatra was such a flop! 




 This could be the next Dredd guyz! Because a mid Budget Hyperviolent comic book movie totally needs the same amount of support as a $150 million tentpole production with a massive marketing budget!!! 




 So is Pitch Perfect 2 a low budget Horror movie or a Big Budget Tentpole Blockbuster, expected to destroy everything in its path? 




 Like two days ago when I watched Babadook... or a week ago when I watched it follows... 




 If the movie industry worked like that, every movie would be paranormal activity, considering that film was made for 30K but made hundreds of millions at the box office. 




 I can't believe a tentpole production with a huge marketing budget mad its money back! It's almost as if Mad Max: Fury Road isn't some sort of obscure cult film! 




 the bikes aren't actually plugged in to anything. It's just another mindless distraction to keep people stimulated. 




 This is the same Miller who RUINED the Babe 2: Pig in the city and Happy feet 2, and stripped all the hardcore ultraviolence of the originals out, to be replaced with 'family' themes. Some people WANT to see Babe gouge out the eyes of some chump, George! 




 MMM, Adult heterosexual males sure are a risky market! 




 Basically, companies force journalists to stick to review embargoes, in return for giving these journalists resources/interviews/free tickets/ flights to sets and the like. This is so they can allow the reviews to coincide with marketing and release of the film. Since the early screenings of Fury Road were a week ago, I'm guessing the embargo is to carry the momentum to the final screening, rather than have it be 'old news'. 




 Yeah, but I beat Gerhman by parrying every one of his attacks, and, to me, the MP and Gwyn were way more challenging (at least MP has the take you down to 1hp attack, and Gwyn is the only boss you can parry, so few people try) 




 When he says the upgrade system being unfinished, I'm guessing he's referring to Raw and crystal upgrading being objectively inferior, and regular upgrading rendering Boss weapons/armor irrelevant. 




 Well, Gwyn was still more powerful than the Taurus demon, and he has a reason for being underpowered, (burning in the first flame) and he can't be killed in three hits, unless you use parries, which are also really effective against Gerhman. I wouldn't know how 'difficult' the moon presence is compared to Gerhman, because I beat them both first time, so, for me at least the point still stands (You also wouldn't be able to beat either of them at level 1 as easily as CB) 




 But the cleric beast doesn't give you any Ludwig weaponry, has no visual association with Ludwig, and is the weakest boss in the game, despite Ludwig being one of the strongest/most represented characters in the Lore, meaning that Ludwig is less powerful than Vicar Amelia, Gascoigne, etc. 




 This is for Fury Road. The originals were all filmed in Australia. 




 It's kind of weird there's so little blood minister speculation. He's vital to the plot, but we never find out who he is. Is he related to the moon presence in some way? 




 I think Kojima needs the pick me up right now :( 









 Nintendo games encompass every style and age range available, what 'specific type of game' do they make? 




 The Dub is pretty much unanimously agreed to be better than the sub, even by the creator of the show, and is regarded as one of the best of all time. The show doesn't have a 'definitive' conclusion (it's likely to have a second season) but has two very satisfying endings, and the fanservice is pretty minimal, at least as far as I remember (aside from an OVA, which has two pretty fanservicey scenes.) 




 It's great! Watch the dub though, it's a great dub and it makes more sense for the setting than Japanese. 




 Black Lagoon is pretty good at it. 




 So, since it's FROM software tradition to put the moonlight sword in every game, and this game continues the other tradition with patches, does anyone know if the sword is being used by a mob/replicated by another weapon? 




 I don't really think Annalise was attempting to birth a great one, considering she seems to be a relatively neutral party, and got attacked by the executioners. If we're throwing really off the wall theories up, may I suggest that The wet nurse is actually Velka from Dark souls? She's implied to be more omnipotent than the other Gods in that game, has a strong association with crows, and Marvelous Chester is implied to come from a victorian setting, which implies that Yarnham may be Carim from DS, a land that Velka is strongly implied to be associated with.  




 There's a theory that Bloodborne actually takes place in Carim from Dark souls, and that Marvelous chester actually comes from the future period of the area. 




 Well, there are Arch trees in the background of the hunters dream... 




 For example, something like Ash Lake in Dark souls: It initially appears to be a cool secret area, but it actually finishes off a number of plotlines, and introduces the idea that Havel was a traitor. Similarly, the painted world changes the context of the entire game. 




 Hey, Bloodborne and Pillars of eternity are both pretty great AAA games that have a good range of characters and personalities (barring the Kickstarter backer controversy for POE) 




 The writing of Life is strange just isn't up to par with something like Wolf among us or Gone Home to me. As a cynical guy of around the age group of life is strange, the dissonance between the fiction of the game and the reality of what I would **Like** to do in certain situations is to much to bear for me, and I find it **Really** difficult to relate to a upper middle class photography student who uses a polaroid camera and can rewind time to potentially solve literally every problem in her life (and chooses not to for plot convenience). 




 Eh, don't give Dontnod too much credit. They also said Capcom were the only studio that didn't think remember me should have a male protagonist, and I personally don't really buy the idea that they picked Square Enix just because they were the only studio not to make it into a bro-shooter, but hey, I generally dislike Life is Strange, so maybe I'm letting my personal biases affect me. 




 Ah, fair enough, I don't have the guidebook so I obviously couldn't verify myself. 




 Yeah, I tried to use the cane effectively, but because the animation is pretty longs, almost every other attack he would parry and instakill me. I was fine if he tried to melee me, but **every** time that gun was fired it either took off 1/3 of health or countered me. 




 Yeah, Because it's not my tweet I didn't want to claim it as my own, and I screwed up the title. Should I make a new thread? 




 The Cainhurst Cathedral hunter has killed me more time than any boss, I tried every combo of weapons, every paper, every cheesy tactic.... and I ended up killing eileen because I was trying to hit him with the whip through the door, I tried to quickly reload, but nope, he's back to full health and Eileen is still dead. 


So I decided, I was going to **destroy** this guy, I complete the entire rest of the game using Eileen set, I realize I'm easily kicking Gerhmans ass, so I prepare to face this guy one final time, avenging Eileens death...

And he kills me, again and again. Finally, I try to cheese him with the same door technique, but I have to take a phonecall. I get back to the game and... something weird is happening, he seems to be taking damage from his start point. It turns out he has his chikage stuck in 2 hand mode, and the AI didn't know to put it back. I watched him die, both robbed of my revenge, and the Eileen quest.

People say the moon presence is the final boss... Not for me. 









 You could even point to evidence that she's the only **actual** God in the game, and that everyone else are merely giants who claim godhood. 




 And that conspiracy is speculated to just be a part of an even bigger conspiracy by a Character who is never even fought in Velka, and in reality EVERY ending simply plays into her hands. 




 Hate to say I told ya so ;) 




 I'm really counting down the days until they reveal that Squirrel girl is a reincarnation of the sentry, or the phoenix force or whatever. It's inevitable that a writer will try to explain it in some arbitrary capacity. 




 Looking forward to seeing Pyrion win yet another game ;) 




 But the panel goes out of its way to say he ISN'T Bi, despite the fact that this is meant to be a past version of Bobby, and future Bobby has never even really been hinted as gay. Moreover, when Jean outs him against his will, it's a pretty scummy move. 




 Eh, as a big comics guy, I can't help but feel that there should be a little more justification as to why a 52 year old character that has always been portrayed as heterosexual is now suddenly gay, particularly as the marvel universe is supposedly rebooting to allow for this sort of change to established characters. 




 Hey, I don't make the rules, and the rules I wrote on my invisible typewriter clearly state that Sjin, despite playing a perfect game, gets a **E-** for complaining. 




 Despite that, Brettor should really give him an **E-** for complaining. 




 The hunters are the replacement for the knights. Multiple times I've tried to fight huners only for them to kick my ass due to being too tough, such as Henryk and his pal. 




 There's *Tonnes* of exploration in Bloodborne. You've been watching the wrong lets plays bud. 




 30 seconds is still seconds! 




 Hey, the Pyrion/Sjin team up totally DOMINATED 2v2v2, expect a similar turnaround here. 




 Wait, you mean to tell me that Christopher Nolan ISN'T the worst director in History? Say it aint so! 




 It's weird, despite the attempt to keep it family friendly, Zoeys character only reminds me of this scene: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTrJa197dSk) 




 Eh, sort of. The course is the same as Ninja warrior (although easier) and it keeps the meat grinder format of people of Ninja warrior. It's way better than Total wipeout in any case. 




 Seriously, it's Generic ITV programming that's been hijacked by Maniacs, Tailors, Freaks and closeted axe murderers. 




 Birdo from the mario franchise is also supposedly trans, and I believe there are also characters in Danganrompa and guilty gear who are talked up as trans. Dark souls also MIGHT have a trans character, but that's left up to lore interpretation. 




 /r/nocontext 




 And TB donates thes second highest amount of money on Jims Patreon.... 




 Hey, you didn't happen to be at a showing of ex machina, did you? A woman there was typing on her phone *with bloody sticky keys on* and she ended up getting shouted down. 




 Yet another attempt by the SJW media to insert female characters into videogames. Why can't we have a game about Mean BOYS huh? 




 The swans just seem to 'click' with some people more than others. They're by far the most powerful, it's just translating that power into reality that becomes problematic. 




 Salt crybabarines 




 Katie Hopkins makes money from being a professional scumbag. It's people giving her this sort of attention that lets her make tens of thousands from appearances. 




 Well, that dev also lost tens of thousands by giving the money to a guy who never did any work, and apparently the price of backer rewards was more than the Kickstarter money, meaning the yogscast lost a tonne of money. 




 I was kind of surprised nobody posted that feud here, considering it was a **massive** drama on the yogscast and cynicalbrit reddits. 




 Well, it's one thing to have an opinion, it's another to be flat out wrong.


If you're saying that they DON'T look exactly alike, how I am I 'flat out wrong' in saying that Bane doesn't look like comic-Bane in batman and Robin? Why are you going *out of your way* to give Batman and Robin objective credit that it doesn't deserve? It's such a childlike mentality to assume that the other person is


categorically incorrect


for not subscribing to your view of the world. 




 A subjective statement can't have an objective answer. Pointing out some similarities between Batman and Robin Bane and comic bane does not mean he suddenly starts looking EXACTLY like comic bane. You just wanted to go on a rant about TDKR for some reason, and decided to make a massive post, with tonnes of hyperlinks, despite the fact I just don't care. 




 Wow, I've never seen someone go through so much effort to express opinions I don't agree with *At all*. Sorry I can't Reciprocate.  




 Considering his past responses, I'm not sure his computer can even *run* civ. 




 bane in Batman and Robin doesn't *Really* look like comic book bane though. bane is meant to be a hulking mass of a man, but he's around the same size as Clooney in that film. The Mask/Colouring isn't quite right either. 




 Indie games also don't need to be Ps4 exclusive, or have advanced graphics and lighting. Acting like 30fps is unmanageable is pretty elitist, and it's extremely unfair to compare bloodborne to mgsV 




 Because MGSV has a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars, has hundreds of team members, and a custom built engine designed to scale to everything. Bloodborne is made by way fewer people, and they likely decided to focus on the graphics, and things like the multiplayer component, rather than the framerate. It's not like 60FPS was actually working properly in that time, it was likely dropping down way too much to be playable. 




 Don't forget xenoblade Chronicles x and FF XV! 




 Destructoid is the site I frequent the most. You may also want to check out the Jimquisition. Jim Sterling said he was 'writing his favorite review in ages' a while ago. 




 They actually did, a characters girlfriend has the aug, but it doesn't really do anything special apart from stop pheromones from working. 




 He actually doesn't kill anyone in that fight, you can see them visibly squirming on the floor, and nobody ever gets hit on the head by the hammer. 




 at nintendo you have Miyamoto, Sakurai, Iwata, Sakamoto and Aunoma, and you still have your Mikami's and Inafune. 




 Helikite's drake's fire doesn't factor fire resistance in, hence why it kills people in full fire res gear. Whilst in a 'story' the drake would easily be beat, because it's a derivative of an actual dragon, in the actual game logic, the drake would have much more of a chance. 




 I wonder if how this sub would have reacted if the original post was called something more neutral, or even Simon favoring, than 'I'm disappointed Simon.' I'd also like to see how badly the sub got brigaded by /r/cynicalbrit or /r/kotakuinaction.  




 hey couldn't you go and see a more obscure indie film than just giving up entirely?  




 But isn't the helikites fire one of the most powerful attacks in the game, period? I know experienced players certainly have more trouble with fighting the drake normally. 




 Nah, I'm not the Op, and literally took the most recent example. Why does TB feel the need to reply top stuff he's not tagged in? Particularly as he KNOWS that when he replies, his followers will attack and harass that person. (see also, Brianna Wu Matt Lees and those charity streamers, ) he also said [videogames should be apolitical] (https://twitter.com/Totalbiscuit/status/578685278342287360) something that is, in my opinion, extremely regressive, and he decided to get annoyed at Jim Sterling for [posting a trans awareness page.](https://archive.today/KTGv3) Simon has a right to criticize TB, particularly as TB's tweet in question called a random artist a 'moron' for daring to make a pop culture reference. 




 [Here ya go](https://archive.today/4PCU7) 




 Not 'obviously' wrong. he has every right to call TB out when he calls a random comics artist a moron.You don't have to agree with his conduct or anything, but he certainly wasn't 'obviously in the wrong' 









 Guys, this isn't what the boss would do! We need to scatter Kojimas ashes to the endless sea! 




 Well, my dad works at konami and he said he's in the game. 




 To be honest, I'm more curious as to what this means for Silent hills. TPP is going to release anyway, but I'd hate for SH to be in  Limbo. 




 If Konami was competently run, they could easily get a bunch of teams together who make great games. A 2d Castlevania game made by the original team would sell gangbusters in this climate. 




 I look forward to seeing Kojima move to Moby Dick studios! 




 Yeah. She was introduced in Suicide Squad, then got introduced properly to the family. The only time she was actually Batgirl was a carryover from the 66' TV series, and she wasn't that relevant back then. Which is why it was kinda weird she became the new Batgirl, despite the prestige, she never really WAS that character. 




 To provide further context, at the time, the story was seen as outside of continuity, as it's heavily implied to be a silver age batman story (Batgirl was only around in the silver age, there hasn't actually been a 'modern' batgirl till nu52) so Moore was given free reign to do whatever he wanted. It would be a few years before Barbara came back as a disable character, in the pages of suicide squad. 




 To be fair, it's being heavily implied that he'll die in the next batman issue.
