 Rick Perry owns a ranch called Niggerhead, not Mitt Romney. 




 The "Stars   Bars" wasn't appropriated from some other country   culture like the Swastika was, and if you had a German friend who went home and brought everyone back a Swastika, there would be only one way to interpret that.

 To distract from TPP. 




 But that really isn't a fifth option, it would still fall under number two, that he did do it, but for some other reason than the one being stated  




 When you say that it was a False Flag are you saying that:

1) 9 people were shot, but this Dylann Roof didn't do it, that someone else did and he is being framed? 

2) Or that he did do it, but for some other reason than the one being stated? 

3) Or that those 9 people aren't really dead, but are being hidden away somewhere? 

4) Or that these 9 people and the shooter aren't real people, but were just invented and maintained sometime in the past to be used for this scenario?

I would find it easier to believe 1 or 2 than 3 or 4

 Considering that she once unsuccessfully sued the historically black Howard University and the chairman of its art department for allegedly discriminating against her in order to favor African-American students, I'm pretty sure she didn't receive scholarship money.

 The first link states that

The United States forces will use [Al Taqqadum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Taqaddum_Air_Base), an Iraqi base near the town of Habbaniya in eastern Anbar Province, as their training hub, the White House said.

 One of the petitioners challenging the law "explained that she is currently forced to store her handgun in a lock box and that if an intruder broke into her home at night, she would need to 'turn on the lights, find [her] glasses, find the key to the lockbox, insert the key in the lock and unlock the box... and then get [her] gun.'

 But of course, without the law, she wouldn't need to turn on the lights or find her glasses. She'd just whip her loaded gun out from under her pillow and drop that perp in one shot, in the dark, without he glasses.

 So what if the American public electeds a Democrat in the next presidential election? Will they just refuse to vote on judicial nominees until 2021? What if that Democrat is reelected? Will they just refuse to vote on judicial nominees until the voters give in and vote the way the GOP wants them to? 




 The CNN/ORC poll found that about 46 percent of Americans view Clinton favorably while 50 percent view her unfavorably. While 50% maybe more than 46%, it's still only half, not most.

 At the end of the day, you're still putting stock in the opinions of a Penthouse centerfold as to the quantifications of a Presidential candidate.

I like this, let's continue doing this. 




 This is like saying you left your children $300,000 in debt because you left them a mortgaged house with 3 $600 payments left. 




 when a president of either party asks, you say yes. 




 If the media treats a candidate like they're relevant, it's because they're a threat, but if the media treats them like they aren't relevant, it's because they are a treat.  




 I get that, I just don't think that a pedophile is going to stop molesting kids because they have contracted an STD and the penalty has increased. I also don't think child molestation should've ever been just a class 3 felony in the first place.   




 I'm guessing this works on the assumption that someone who's willing to molest a kid is willing to do 3 years for it, but wouldn't do it if it was 10? 




 Right now there are [U.S. soldiers in Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forces_Japan) who weren't even born when Pearl Harbor occurred.

 Why is politics the one profession that people feel an absolute novice should be able to start at the top of the field?   




 Did you notice that the story was about Carly Fiorina, who seems to be incapable of either? 









 First time I heard this song was in the late sixties on a Roger Miller album, can't remember the name of it, cover was of him sitting in a porch swing with an acoustic guitar, for a while I thought he had written it. 




 How long will every fourth headline in /r/politics have "Carson" in it, even in links like this one, that isn't even really about him? 




 While details about the gunmen, including their religion or their motive, weren't immediately known,

How do we know that this wasn't just a personal vendetta and has nothing to do with Islam and Free Speech? 




 A rehearsal where the protesters got what they wanted, the government wasn't able to control the information coming out? Sounds like a bad rehearsal.  




 No one has identified any of the shooters as Muslims. They know who did it, they shot and killed them. Is it possible that they weren't Muslims?

 Jeffrey Dahmer was murdered in prison, should that have been factored in when considering whether to bring charges against him? 




 Don't know, ask Reuters, it's was there headline before they changed it. 




 Maybe they will come out during the trial? 




 Not by compromise. That's the whole point of Sanders. 




 And yet you assume that this officer wasn't driving at a high rate of speed and his prisoner sustained serious bodily harm while he drove slowly and carefully? 




 According to conventional wisdom on r/politics, everyone except African Americans who voted for Obama, now regret that decision and wouldn't vote for Clinton either and will stay home and vote for none of the above unless Rand Paul gets the GOP nomination. So if Reddit is any indicator, it should be a cakewalk for Sanders. 




 I never used the term "High speed". Are your are trying to incite people to lynch me? 




  shit birt?

 




 They'll still get their day in court and the best lawyers their gofundme campaign can buy. 




 And without casino owners or super PACs. 




 This has been covered in this thread already and addressed by the mods, OP posted the original headline just as Reuters had ran it, then Reuters changed their headline on the article.   




 A "lynch mob" is when you aren't given your day in court because someone kills you before that can happen, much like what happened to Freddie Gray. 




 No, he needs to keep being Bernie. 









 After having clicked the link, I'm thinking more like Pam Grier.  














 [List of charges for 6 officers in Freddie Gray's death](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/01/baltimore-police-charges-freddie-gray/26701383/) 









 Yes. The rest are being charged with like negligent homicide or something.  




 When a defendant commits an act even though he knows his act runs an unusually high risk of causing death or serious bodily harm to someone else. Like doing doughnuts in a paddy wagon with a shacked, but unseatbelted, detainee in the back. 




 As the mods have already pointed out in this thread, OP posted Reuters original headline   then Reuters changed their headline.  




 Shaft?

 Or he could choose option B, win spending less money.

  prosecutor

noun

a person, especially a public official, who institutes legal proceedings against someone.

 So maybe some white people should go down to city hall and protest against them being charged? 




 I wonder if white protesters will show up to protest against them being charged? 














 But we had all those veterans fresh from the SpanishAmerican War (1898) and the PhilippineAmerican War (18991902). 




 That's like saying only those with blood on their hands can stop the violence.

 When a pot calls a kettle black, it's still true. 




 Will Cruz be a unifying force? Will he be able to explain to African Americans why there is a perfectly good reason they're more than twice as likely to be shot in the back or put in a choke hold by a police officer while unarmed for selling untaxed cigarettes or driving with a broken tail light, than white americans are? 




 Funny how this was basically the norm for the first half of the twentieth century.

 Pretty sure whoever the next President is, the White House Correspondents Dinner won't be as much fun as it was under Obama and Bush. 




 And pointing out his ethnicity and/or his religious beliefs is the best way to communicate his political beliefs? Like, if he was Afro-American, you would point that out to show that he is a democrat? Or if he was LDS, you would point to that as proof that he supports polygamous marriage? 

   I have no doubt of Adelson's support of right wing Israeli foreign policy, but Perry and Cruz prove that one need not be Jewish to hold such opinions and I'm pretty sure simply being Jewish doesn't automatically make one hold those opinions.    




 Why is it always necessary to note that Adelson is Jewish? If Barbra Streisand donated money to the Clinton campaign, would the headline be "Hillary Appeals to Jewish Donors"?

 Unless you wanted to have sex with her, what difference does it make? 




 Bush plead guilty to DUI. His daughters were caught trying to buy beer using fake ID's. 1963 Laura Bush ran a stop sign in the Texas and killed a guy. Bush was not only nominated, but was elected and reelected. This means nothing.

 This is one of those show like Easy Aces, that mostly only appreciated by those who are smart enough to know when to laugh without being told.  




 Overall a good job and a good idea. You really do have a good voice for the medium. You should look in to an audio editor, like Audacity. It's free and easy to use and would allow you to record your show without the music and then add it in after to improve the audio quality. 




 So, your telling me that rich, bootstrapy job creators don't move to red states and cities with less taxes and less regulations?
