 Jed York is not the source of all our woes.

Harbaugh was too loyal to incompetent subordinates, all the retirements made sense even if unexpected, and all the trades or free agent losses made sense.  It's just that they all happened in a very short span of time. 




  The problem with the American left is that it's addicted to shortcuts.

No, the problem with the American left is that that the American right exists.  Those shortcuts are a necessary response to reactionary state legislatures dominated by an electorate of scared old Boomers who come out *en masse* in the mid-terms. 




 When posts have sections that one does not understand, one gets bored.  But if one simply skips over these sections and reads on, one will understand everything later.  As for practicing badhistory and good, it is good simply to imitate other redditors.  If you do this, you will change your flair, in time, naturally. 




 I don't read the script.  Script reads me. 




 If you were suddenly to change all this, deficiencies and distortions would appear here and there, where you least expect them.  This is worth thinking about. 




 Bone and bone, flesh and flesh, though we build cities and walls we remain creatures of the earth, approaching death, faced with our own mortality. The sword swings, the cow is cut, but the cow is a man not in fact but in truth.

So at this point you just started dropping acid?

Because I totally understand, if so. 




 Yes, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm right.  The U.S. has been keeping up a pretty strong air campaign against ISIS for a while now.  That's the opposite of "choosing not to act." 




 I don't know if you've been keeping up with current events (it seems unlikely), but we've been bombing the hell out of ISIS for a long time. 




 Nothing quite like having the KKK on your side.

That pretty much sums up the Palin clan, though I wouldn't credit them as a whole with two entire brain cells. 




  Fuck that we have enough dead weight

You are, of course, referring to all the Republican states that take in far more federal money than they send back?  Because I'm sure that's what you must be talking about. 




  Your argument would be stronger if they didn't include other things besides slavery.

Ah, yes.  The declaration of secession very vaguely and briefly mentions other stuff.  Way to cherry-pick amidst the vast bulk and length of slave-owning causality.  Because, hey, it couldn't have been the thing that 80% of the declaration specifically talks about, it must have been that other 20%. 




  I can't really accept this seeing as how the states that left over slavery were all eastern states.

Pretty much all the states at the time were Eastern states.

You really need to change your name, because you completely fucking suck at history. 




  But for Texas and Virginia it was about nationalism.

What a load of complete horseshit.  Here's the declaration of secession of the state of Texas, which mentions the abolition of slavery about fifty times as the primary point of grievance:


 Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them? 
 
 The controlling majority of the Federal Government, under various pretences and disguises, has so administered the same as to exclude the citizens of the Southern States, unless under odious and unconstitutional restrictions, from all the immense territory owned in common by all the States on the Pacific Ocean, for the avowed purpose of acquiring sufficient power in the common government to use it as a means of destroying the institutions of Texas and her sister slaveholding States. 
 
 By the disloyalty of the Northern States and their citizens and the imbecility of the Federal Government, infamous combinations of incendiaries and outlaws have been permitted in those States and the common territory of Kansas to trample upon the federal laws, to war upon the lives and property of Southern citizens in that territory, and finally, by violence and mob law, to usurp the possession of the same as exclusively the property of the Northern States. 
 
 The Federal Government, while but partially under the control of these our unnatural and sectional enemies, has for years almost entirely failed to protect the lives and property of the people of Texas against the Indian savages on our border, and more recently against the murderous forays of banditti from the neighboring territory of Mexico; and when our State government has expended large amounts for such purpose, the Federal Government has refuse reimbursement therefor, thus rendering our condition more insecure and harassing than it was during the existence of the Republic of Texas. 
 
 These and other wrongs we have patiently borne in the vain hope that a returning sense of justice and humanity would induce a different course of administration. 
 
 When we advert to the course of individual non-slave-holding States, and that a majority of their citizens, our grievances assume far greater magnitude. 
 
 The States of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa, by solemn legislative enactments, have deliberately, directly or indirectly violated the 3rd clause of the 2nd section of the 4th article [the fugitive slave clause] of the federal constitution, and laws passed in pursuance thereof; thereby annulling a material provision of the compact, designed by its framers to perpetuate the amity between the members of the confederacy and to secure the rights of the slave-holding States in their domestic institutions-- a provision founded in justice and wisdom, and without the enforcement of which the compact fails to accomplish the object of its creation. Some of those States have imposed high fines and degrading penalties upon any of their citizens or officers who may carry out in good faith that provision of the compact, or the federal laws enacted in accordance therewith. 
 
 In all the non-slave-holding States, in violation of that good faith and comity which should exist between entirely distinct nations, the people have formed themselves into a great sectional party, now strong enough in numbers to control the affairs of each of those States, based upon an unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and their beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color-- a doctrine at war with nature, in opposition to the experience of mankind, and in violation of the plainest revelations of Divine Law. They demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy, the recognition of political equality between the white and negro races, and avow their determination to press on their crusade against us, so long as a negro slave remains in these States. 
 
 For years past this abolition organization has been actively sowing the seeds of discord through the Union, and has rendered the federal congress the arena for spreading firebrands and hatred between the slave-holding and non-slave-holding States. 
 
 By consolidating their strength, they have placed the slave-holding States in a hopeless minority in the federal congress, and rendered representation of no avail in protecting Southern rights against their exactions and encroachments. They have proclaimed, and at the ballot box sustained, the revolutionary doctrine that there is a 'higher law' than the constitution and laws of our Federal Union, and virtually that they will disregard their oaths and trample upon our rights. 
 
 They have for years past encouraged and sustained lawless organizations to steal our slaves and prevent their recapture, and have repeatedly murdered Southern citizens while lawfully seeking their rendition. 
 
 They have invaded Southern soil and murdered unoffending citizens, and through the press their leading men and a fanatical pulpit have bestowed praise upon the actors and assassins in these crimes, while the governors of several of their States have refused to deliver parties implicated and indicted for participation in such offenses, upon the legal demands of the States aggrieved. 
 
 They have, through the mails and hired emissaries, sent seditious pamphlets and papers among us to stir up servile insurrection and bring blood and carnage to our firesides. 
 
 They have sent hired emissaries among us to burn our towns and distribute arms and poison to our slaves for the same purpose. 
 
 They have impoverished the slave-holding States by unequal and partial legislation, thereby enriching themselves by draining our substance. 
 
 They have refused to vote appropriations for protecting Texas against ruthless savages, for the sole reason that she is a slave-holding State. 
 
 And, finally, by the combined sectional vote of the seventeen non-slave-holding States, they have elected as president and vice-president of the whole confederacy two men whose chief claims to such high positions are their approval of these long continued wrongs, and their pledges to continue them to the final consummation of these schemes for the ruin of the slave-holding States. 
 
 In view of these and many other facts, it is meet that our own views should be distinctly proclaimed. 
 
 We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable. 
 
 That in this free government *all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights* [emphasis in the original]; that the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races, as advocated by our sectional enemies, would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states. 
 
 By the secession of six of the slave-holding States, and the certainty that others will speedily do likewise, Texas has no alternative but to remain in an isolated connection with the North, or unite her destinies with the South. 
 
 For these and other reasons, solemnly asserting that the federal constitution has been violated and virtually abrogated by the several States named, seeing that the federal government is now passing under the control of our enemies to be diverted from the exalted objects of its creation to those of oppression and wrong, and realizing that our own State can no longer look for protection, but to God and her own sons-- We the delegates of the people of Texas, in Convention assembled, have passed an ordinance dissolving all political connection with the government of the United States of America and the people thereof and confidently appeal to the intelligence and patriotism of the freemen of Texas to ratify the same at the ballot box, on the 23rd day of the present month. 
 
 Adopted in Convention on the 2nd day of Feby, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one and of the independence of Texas the twenty-fifth.

Your slavery-apologia revisionism is a disgrace to America. 




 ... it's 15 now? 




  I have asked you to cite the federal power listed in the constitution that allows them to keep states in the union against their will.

... Jesus Christ, just how many chromosomes are you missing?  The Constitution, by virtue of existing and having no secession clause, creates a binding compact. 

You have also woefully misreported the 10th amendment.

Well, I guess either both I and 230 years of Supreme Court decisions are wrong, or someone who can't handle basic logic is wrong.  I mean, the Tenth Amendment relies upon assuming states being part of the existing federal framework.  What's so fucking hard to understand about that? 




 Uh, everything I've posted has supported my argument.  You've just repeated the same thing over and over like a parrot.  You haven't addressed ... well ... *anything*. 




 ... you're just not very bright, are you? 




  how does signing it mean you can never quit? Please cite this for me.

Because there's no mechanism for doing so.  It's a binding contract with no escape clause.

It actually specifically LIMITS federal power. It puts states rights OUTSIDE of federal jurisdiction.

Uh, yes.  But that federal jurisdiction is explicitly stated to exist in the first place.  The Tenth Amendment empirically acknowledges that states are a part of a larger federal framework.  Your argument undermines itself. 




 You're thinking of the HMS Rose replica.  The prime giveaway is the lack of a quarterdeck - Hermione is flush. 




  Seeing as there is nothing in the constitution to force a state to stay,

Except for, you know, *signing it*.

the 10th amendment is quite clear.

Tenthers are particularly stupid.  The Tenth Amendment doesn't validate either nullification or secession - it just says that the state can make laws, within the boundaries of federal jurisdiction.  You know, *within*, not *outside of*. 




  I asked for a citation from the Constitution.

Yeah, just keep shifting those goalposts.  There's no mechanism in the Constitution for secession, you know.  At all. 




 So you ignored the Supreme Court decisions cited, in favor of ... what?  Your *opinion*?  Just because you don't want it to be true doesn't mean it isn't. 




 Here are two /r/AskHistorians posts that sum it up better than I could:

  a rebellion requires opposing existing controls, not resisting newly imposed controls.

No ... no, that's not right.  You're just making shit up.

 One of the most drastic changes to come out of the war was the precedent that the US is like a street gang, you are never allowed to quit

That wasn't a change.  That was true from the ratification of the Constitution. 




  Or that it was a rebellion in the first place and not a secession movement.

... it *was* a rebellion.  That's kind of the point. 




  Sounds like hot air used to diffuse the opinion that the north was waging a war of aggression

It was a political move, to ensure that Britain didn't side with the Confederacy.  But Lincoln needed a solid battlefield victory to do that. 




 Sometimes, history is re-written by the loser.  The Lost Cause apologists who insist slavery wasn't the motivation for the rebellion of the Confederacy are a prime example. 




 OK?  I'm not sure what your point is, but that's because I'm pretty sure you don't actually have one. 




  No other segment of society throws a parade to exhibit its most perverse membership.

You mean like beauty pageants?  Or Mardi Gras?  Or every other day of the year? 




 You sound bitter.  It's pretty sad. 




 "Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell," in perfect condition, for $.54 at the thrift shop.  

Unfortunately, I just can't get into it - I've been reading the Aubrey/Maturin series for the past two weeks, and "Strange/Norrell" just seems a weak, uninspiring work by comparison when it comes to Napoleonic-era historical fiction.  Which is a shame, because it would otherwise be the kind of book I love. 




  How come when people desecrate the American flag and people complain, liberals shout "It's just a piece of cloth!"
 Now that it is this piece of cloth liberals scream "RACISM!!! OPPRESSION!!!! BIGOTS!!!".

You seem to be deliberately misunderstanding the point - in *both* cases the flags in questions are *symbols*, to be treated as such.

 




  I'm well aware of their capabilities, but the P-8 just lack the presence of the old Orions.

That's funny, I feel the same way about P-3s doing firefighting duty.  They just lack the presence of the old radial-engined WW-II era converted bombers.

  What was the point of the Panion Domin (his manipulation?)

The Pannion Seer was a creature of pure pain, and he wanted to spread pain and suffering for its own sake.

 What was the point of Ruthald and his Cursed Sword?

 Who were the Strangers (the Jade things in the Sky)

The souls of the Crippled God's people, coming to find him and drag him back to their world.

 What happened on the Moon?

Some of the Jade Giants ran into it, destroying it.

 Why did the other gods destroy the Fallen God?

Why not?  They had their spheres of influence, and he was encroaching.

 Why did the fallen god and the other gods become friends?

An alliance of mutual interest - he wanted to leave, and they wanted him gone.

 What did the Fallen God do to the Otataral Dragon?

Nothing - that was Heboric, re-chaining the Otataral Dragon.

 Why did the Fallen God get stabbed in the back by Cotollion?

Presumably because he couldn't leave in his corporeal form, and had to be freed from a physical body.

 Who was trying to kill the Bridgburners? Tayschern turned out to be innocent.

The politics are muddled, but it wasn't so much the Bridgeburners as Whiskeyjack, whom the Empress viewed as a rival power.  Tayschrenn just wasn't good at court politics.

 Why were Mallic Rel   friend get spared and become emperor?

Mallick Rel had corrupted the Claw, and his version of the Fall at Aren prevailed, making him out to be the hero.  Laseen couldn't compete with his influence.

These are just the questions off the top of my head, the author never explains anything and now he is selling more books? its just signs of a poor writer.

It's all explained pretty clearly.  It's more a sign of poor reading comprehension. 




 I'm not sure if "heart-wrenching" is the right word, but I've always loved this bittersweet quote from "Toll the Hounds" by Steven Erikson:


He hurried on, grimacing at the ache in his chest, still feeling the parting kiss of his wife on his lips, the careless hugs of his children round his waist.

He was a man who would never ask for sympathy.  He was a man who sought only to do what was right.  Such people appear in the world, every world, now and then, like a single refrain of some blessed song, a fragment caught on the spur of an otherwise raging cacophony.

Imagine a world without such souls.

Yes, is should have been harder to do. 




 Did you even read the article????? 

Yes, it supports my point.

 I'm not arguing whether it's a good or bad name, yes it was started by republicans, but when the admin then starts using the name.... It will stick

The name had already stuck, and was already in very widespread use as shorthand for the ACA, before the White House started using it as a positive.  The very article you linked to points that out. 




 The term "Obamacare" was in very wide-spread use before Obama himself ever said it.  It's use as a pejorative by Republicans for *five years* before he ever claimed the term for his own is what made the name stick.  Republicans *still* use it as an insult. 




  Colloquially it will forever be known as obamacare, BECAUSE Obama called it Obamacare...

Uh, no, that name was created by Republicans. 




  Should not have named it Obamacare in the first place

That was the Republican nickname for it, meant as an insult. 




 Triggered. 




 ... are you not familiar with the whole "Game of Thrones" franchise? 




  Well I mean, in the first book alone Crokus twice comes inches from death because of stupid decisions he made due to his infatuation with Challice and later Sorry, both times only surviving due to literal godly intervention.

Crokus in GotM is, IIRC, seventeen, so "stupid decisions due to infatuation" isn't a plot device so much as a very accurate reflection of real people. 




 Never thought I'd lose my appetite reading a headline involving eating bacon, but there it is.

 Probably as change from one of the villages in the Eld, which borders on Modeg.  Also, to go from Vintas to Ademre, he and Tempi would've passed through Modeg. 




 And that's why he needs to stay in the damned house. 




 Auri's gifts were specifically mentioned as being among the things he didn't take with him to Vintas, but left safe at Anker's. 




 I didn't say "all cops are highly trained," but it sure as hell makes it more likely the person will be more competent. 




  That having a gun, in a church, can be used to prevent a mass shooter from killing people, because that's exactly what happened in Colorado Springs. 

That's not *exactly* what happened in Colorado Springs.  Jeanne Assam was a former police officer carrying out her role as a volunteer security guard.  This doesn't match up with the usual NRA "everyone's a potential Rambo!" wankage.

 Wonder if there were any behind-the-scenes political strings pulled to cause this. 




  I'll take my private insurance any day when it comes to terminal illness.

Health insurance is not treatment.

Not to mention the fact that you can't die in a hospital if you can't get in the hospital for treatment to begin with.

  When you have to ration care, as is necessary under a socialized regime,

Ah, yes, as opposed to a capitalist regime, where health care isn't rationed *at all*, and mistakes never happen, certainly not to the tune of ~~35,000~~ 210,000 deaths a year. 




 We've been arming and training them for twelve years. 




 The Ademre's story from TWMF makes it clear that seven are remembered.  So it's probably six + Lanre/Haliax/Lanre.  Or the "six" number comes from Church storytelling, which is unreliable in a lot of ways.

The top two receiving yard totals of all time  Jerry Rice's 1,848   Isaac Bruce's 1,781  were recorded in 1995. Detroit Lions receiver Herman Moore gained 1,686 yards (6th highest all time) and Dallas Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin gained 1,603 yards (11th most in NFL history)." 

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_NFL_season#Statistical_leaders
