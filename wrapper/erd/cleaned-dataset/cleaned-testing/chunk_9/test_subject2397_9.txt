 I now need fries, fry sauce, and a milkshake 




 The problem is they look so forced. I think it would have been better if there were people doing stuff with bongs or whatever in the background. Like #5, is anyone comfortable looking at all in that pic?

The actual article, not sure why OP posted to this 




 Nick is one of the most forgettable 1 dimensional character in the whole show. He just kinda shows up out of nowhere and I guess we're supposed to be interested in him. The other guys Robin dates at least make sense  




 Frisbee golf is super fun and free at most courses. And the discs cost like $10 and you only need one 




 Cleaning out the Buick Century I got from my grandma today 




 It has multiple levels at least 




 What I think will be crazy about this album is that it will span over a decade of rap styles. Or at least I assume it will?  Style from 2001 is clearly vastly different from now so we'll see 




 I actually wrote a research paper on this. Basically shoes have conditioned us to run heel first. But our feet are arched to absorb and release energy when our feet hit the ground, and it's much more natural to hit the ground with the balls of your feet first 




 They do play at surprise venues in Seattle quite a bit 




 Stop the fiiiight 




 This really is one of the most generic formats of a joke on all sitcoms 




 If you don't ctrl+alt+delete you're doin it wrong 




 Breakfast- I'm with the other guy, none

Lunch-Taqueria Chaparrito

Dinner-Sellas for a calzone

Bar-The Coug although I've been going to My Office alot lately

Dessert-Ferdinands, of course 









 I think most juniors and seniors tend to do better as you learn how to study n stuff. I did poorly with gen chem but much better with O chem. Plus it sounds like you're more interested now with your classes than you were before 




 I have an Arizona Tea hat. Not ashamed at all I love their drinks 




 Well tbh she just heard about the movie and that it had Leo in it, we hadn't seen the trailer or anything so definitely did not expect that 




 Religious mom, sex scene in every shot, coke snorting out of ass. Not something she would want to see

I've only had it a couple days. I can't think of any functions it doesn't have though 




 Sweet wallpaper alert 




 This looks even less like Robin than the first girl did 




 I just got Facebook Messenger (not supported by FB) and you can go to the options and have it pinned to your toolbar. I like it for talking to people without having to stare at facebook 




 I didn't get a cell phone til the end of freshman year of HS in  2008, granted I was later than most people. Girls still passed notes in class though all the way up through senior year 




 Nothin like burnt pizza with rubber cheese. The chocolate milk was good though 




 Wolf of Wall Street. With my mom. We never speak of it again 









 I really liked this episode the first time, but the replayability is low. They kinda beat the theme of it to death. Having to rewatch the same clips like 10 times over gets annoying especially when you already know what's going to happen. I guess it's a nice recap of the show though 




 time for /r/karmacourt then  




 In that case I'm pro at Mario Kart 64 




 I just realized, are you a sophomore? In which case nevermind 




 The toe thumbs give it away 




 Pretty sure it says in the confirmation email you got after you should have gone to the grad fair 




 I just wanted to help the little guy out of there. But I knew he had to do it on his own 




 Marshal being the only supportive person when Ted bought the house 




 I'd say anything in the limbs is fairly mild. The torso/abdomen region is when it can get gruesome with all the organs floating around 




 I can say it is much better than Reggie's

 Just wait til you're in grad school, you could write a thesis on this

 Did anyone else read this at a million miles an hour? 




 More like what the heck is that thing?

 Why are you banned from Walmart? 









 I saw that on my fb feed and thought "yet another news story direct from Reddit" Good job though 




 that seems huge. Is that from less gravity as Earth or just massive volcano?

 Muttnik. It's the logo screen after every episode 









 Who thought "white with random color splotches" was a good tile color?

 Probably because 1999 was most of these people's first actual memories 




 This is really helpful, especially for diagrams that help you learn concepts. Or Ochem structures or whatever. Also writing down notecards is good because you have the action of writing plus repetition later on 




 Can Jack Black please be in more/better movies 




 After Robin says they should go see Woody Allen Barney says "Why would I do that? I'll see him at poker on Tuesday."


Later Ted is explaining why Barney needs a win and Barney says "And firing half my department freed up the money to double my own salary.
And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group."


It's not even a joke really but this is how HIMYM keeps you on your toes when you're watching.  There's stuff like this in just about every episode too 




 /r/theydidthemulletmath oh wait.. 




 I'll actually have a fixed schedule next year so sure! 




 Do you have more rods than normal? Can you see better in the dark? Also since rods are usually in the periphery do you have more centered? Thanks! 




 I don't know what the future of NK holds but I feel like when it gets revealed of what happens there we'll be horrified 




 Tis better to have pressed than to have never pressed at all

 Next years tuition soo 20k?

Just kidding only with a tie

apparently hashtags mean bold in reddit 




 A real expendginger for the company 




 You can have mine. It's free+S H 




 Well he's saying how Elaine is going to "backslide" with David Putty. So he's sayin after they break up people hook up again later often 




 If it's carrying bubonic plague then yes 




 Great part of this is at the end when Barney says he went to MIT and Ted doesn't believe him, then realizes he has no idea where Barney went to college at.


Speaking of which, where did Robin go to college? I want to see College Robin!

ALL ABOARD!! 




 What can I say Reddit's a bunch of softies 




 Same here. Between that and glasses well you get the point.. 




 My neighbor friends' phone numbers

This is perfect. NSFW

 "Will you (insert menial chore here) while I continue to do the exact same job as you are doing" 




 I love Marshal but I've always agreed with what you just said. A lot of the decisions that he makes do not make sense at all, especially him clearly being a smart person. Buying a house within a day of seeing it?  I never thought about the car money thing but that's also a good point 




 I'm 6' 150 and my arms are about that skinny 




 This is why I don't like texting people during the day. It just turns into 'what are you doing' every 20 minutes instead of just telling them what you did at the end of the day 




 If you had taken it with no hands I think you would've been golden 




 I mean like you meet someone at the bar,  get their number, then try and call them later. How did it go? 




 Bob Burnquist was the best. And Superman by Goldfinger all day 




 It actually did snow the other day at WSU but this doesn't look like Pullman at all 









 I live 10 minutes from Idaho. I know where I'm goin tomorrow 




 Bad experience?  




 Is it just me or did the 2nd windmill not actually touch it? 




 Even reheated coffee the same day is bad 




 I thought the rest of the gang's part in this was hilarious, especially drunk Ted and Barney leading the gang. I just thought Mickey's part was creepy and not realistic at all 




 That uniboob 




 M'Claren 




 I thought it was more the old style of things shining through the new design. I probably over-thought it though 




 This is one of my favorite episodes, mostly because of Puzzles. That whole story arc is funny. And Marshal telling the story while getting interrupted is good too 




 Yeahh thebutton is fun but there's like 10 subreddits for it now it's a little excessive  




 Ahh yes. So proud of my school for this one 




 I just saw it go all the way down to 12 s so who knows 




 The closest one on the right it has a very interesting nose 




 Cool! Any info on the planes in this pic? 




 Those could have valuable in store credit value! 




 This episode makes me think it would have been awesome if there would have been 1 episode for the other characters to tell the story instead of Ted, give us a little more insight to their personal thoughts. Especially Barney and Lily, they would be interesting.

So was this a platonic act done by Ted at the end? 




 No. Also they said they would serve anyone that came into their shop they just would not cater a same-sex marriage. I'd say that is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. I can't believe how many people are up in arms against this 




 Red is more underused than some of these, seriously brown? I'd say teal, mint, orange would have been better advice
