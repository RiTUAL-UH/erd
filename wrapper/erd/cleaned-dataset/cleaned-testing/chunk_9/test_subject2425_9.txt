 Im using the 960 just for premiere pro at a resolution of 2560x1600. I have gamed with it before, and it does run games like dota 2 and league maxed out at around 45-60 fps maxed out at native resolution. Triple AAA titles, not so much. Battlefield 4 is really only playable at 1600p at low/medium settings. 

tl;dr: 1080p gaming: 960 would run all games (with a few exceptions) at ultra settings 
         1440p or higher: 970 (would run all games at 1080p on maxed out settings easily). Turn down some of the graphics settings if you are playing at 1440p.


 




 plug the battery back in after doing so (if you didn't). unplug the machine, and hold the power button on the case for 15 seconds. Plug it back in and turn the machine on.  




 Try to find the BIOS battery and disconnect it. This will reset the BIOS settings (that battery still has power even after the power being off for a year). 




 I love them, my type of shoes. I really like the small logo on these type of shoes, [Just like these](http://www.endclothing.com/brands/new-balance-pre-orders/new-balance-m1500sb-made-in-england-m1500sb.html) 




 This has been happening to me too, couldn't find anything on google so I gave up on it.

 Reddit users jump all over things like this, but in actuality comcast has all the power to fine this person. He most likely moved while he was in contract for tv and internet and they served him the fee to finish out his contract. 




 You can build a piratebox! It is basically your own personal cloud that requires no internet service to connect to. It uses a wireless router that emits a wireless signal (~$70), a storage medium (usually a flash drive around 16-128gbs) and a rechargeable battery. Once you have it all set up and flashed the bios, you can set it up with or without a password for people to connect to. When you turn it on, it should emit a wireless signal that most devices can connect to (the same way you connect to a wifi signal) and upload or download files that are stored on the hard drive. It is definitely a nice addition if you want to start a little intranet at your school for people to get answers to homework, or listen to that new song everyone has been talking about it and it happened to be uploaded by somebody around the premises. 

edit: Also, there is no app the devices have to download to upload or download files. You go to the internet browser on the device and the page that is pushed out by the piratebox automatically loads so it is web based. No downloading required.
