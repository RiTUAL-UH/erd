 I'm regretting having ever introduced this to you all. It would have never been shared with the world if not for me. It would have stayed hidden in the shadows. in the dark.

I don't know what's going to happen to all of you. The purpose of this website remains a mystery, but if it was only meant for me it wouldn't have been online. There was no need for a website if not to be shared. Someone wants me to scream for help and I have no choice but to do so. 




 This is very helpful Ra1n. I'm sorry you had to go to the site at all, and I know there are many others who are too afraid to go there (for good reason). Maybe a breakdown is exactly what everyone needs. 




 I'm so sorry, I don't know what I've done linking you all to the site. It could be anything, from the sound of a whisper to that guilty feeling that arises from nothing. I don't know what it leads to. Please stay with me. 




 Thank you for the support bunnieh. I need encouraging words right now. The first thing I thought was whether the bridge could be rebuilt, but no matter how I look at it the river is just too wide. A small glimmer of hope just shattered. 




 It seems to be a sort of e-pamphlet. Everything in it just fills me with fear and questions. I wish I hadn't found it.
