 Definitely no.  Not at the price we have Collins at for the next three years. 




 Obviouysly it was not an era.  The Machida era more accurately was his ascension to the title, and not after that.  Joe Rogan's excitements goes over board a lot, and MMA fans seem to love it and just play with it, more often than not. 




 Rank the fighters he fought in that time period.  Then give us the records of any fighter with a comparable record not named Jon Jones. 




 The only solution is for him to fight Vitor.  Cheeus vs. gay Jesus. 




 Honestly, at this point, any headshots seem like they will take him down. 




 "umm, Mr. Romero has expressed his concern for the direction of the country..." 




 Don't be such a racist.  They have malls there that need protecting, you fucking bigot! 









 i lost this round 









 **SEE ALL YOU ISLAMOPHOBES!!  THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD WASN'T A PAEDO!  HE WAS JUST GOING WITH THE TIMES!!!** 




 But when she was sick and needed the best western medical care, that was different, right? 




 only slightly 




 by toys he means cocks 




 Are people forgetting that Hitchcock turned Modano into a defense first player, causing his offense to drop significantly? 




 She needs a burkha 




 *elitism intensifies* 









 Dirk is Love 




 damn 




 So he's gonna kill Drogon and Dany, right?  That seems to be his story arc. 




 The north sees Russia from it's porch. 




 JUST BLEED BRO!! 




 Bro, I was so hyped about the Machida era, I was honestly thinking he would retire with like a 30-0 record. 




 These first inning props are the funnest bets to make now. 




 Seems like they are intentionally doing it to him for some reason.  Obviously that's not the case, but that's my conspiracy.  Dana is anti-Machida. 




 Yeah, Jon baited Rua into that.  Zingano flew directly at Honda, right? 




 yes it does 




 we lost him 




 Could you make the image smaller?  I almost read some words. 




 I want to use this shake as a meal replacement, but not for all three meals, like the website suggests.  Maybe one or two meals a day.

My question is, is this too good to be true?  All the nutrients we need for a keto diet in a simple shake?  There's not uch information on the website, so I don't know where else to turn.  Asking the company itself to critique their product seems counter productive.
 




 I do not 




 yeah, work sucks 




 Thanks for the response.  I kind of want to track different people, so now, you're on the list. 




 Could you elaborate? 




 Is there any more information than "trust us, we'll make good picks"? 









 And save the receipt. 




 Good boy 




 I was really hoping for a dickbutt AK47

 I work in downtown with about 15 Filipinos.  I just sent this to the network printer and am just gonna leave it there.  Pretty sure they'll all flip. 




 He'll probably try to bully Aldo into a bad fight and have him fight injured, and then call him a pussy in public, like he did with Shogun/Glover a while back. 




 Nobody's, gonna say anything, about, that comma? 




 I Just want him to Rock Bottom jabronis in all his movies. 




 There is an are in between throwing the book at someone and being unreasonably lenient.  And leniency is almost always shown to rich kids, not the poor.

That's whet gets people upset.  Knowing that if they were in the same position, they would not get a 2 year rehab sentence with 10 year parole. 




 Yeah, that's the stupidest thing I've read in regards to this case.  Since when is the legal system supposed to pity someone's upbringing when doling out justice?  Oh yeah, when they're rich as fuck, that's when.

Poor person with shitty upbringing/bad parenting background commits a crime?  Throw the fucking book at him.  Whoever gilded that retarded ass comment is a fucking moron. 




 You just didn't even try, did you? 




 now's fine 




 Good god, consider the fucking source, OP.  This site is batshit crazy right wing propaganda at its finest (or worst, I don't know, whatever).

Hell, FOXNews would be a more reputable source than this bullshit. 




 Who will ever know? 




 Oh yay. ESPN covered nudity.  




 Thanks for updating your results. 




 rollin dubs 




 such transformation 




 Forcing her to pay money she legally owes is **RAPE**.  And if you disagree, you are a rapist!!

Don't anyone DARE try to hold glorious leader accountable for her actions! 




 This is sickening.  My only hope is that the IDF doesn't use this as an excuse to go all ham on people not involved. 




 Those seem kind of like filler words that don't really mean anything.  Maybe in his era, doing what you love could keep you happy and fed, but rarely is that the case today. 




 Those damn black muslim commie antichrist presidents!  When will people stop electing them? 




 The Longest Yard? 




 oh, your friend is 2009 popular culture? 




 why? 




 /r/itdoesntmatterhowoldyouarethisisretarded 




 Bovada's late lines are the bane of my existence 




 SHAME!! 




 God damn. Reem was owning, too. 




 oh 




 /r/TeamWhiteWalker  




 Where is the fucking downvote button? 




 Yes. 




 You know what gets cut.  Social safety net programs. 




 Daniel Day Lewis ain't got shit. 




 TOO LOW!!! 




 well, obviously 




 Hey, that's not a real website!

You're a phony.  A big fat phony! 














 At this rate, Olly is gonna double murder Dany and Drogon. 




 no fucking way...is that fan fic? 




 **ALL YOU CIS SCUM MISOGYNISTS!!!  YOU JUST WAIT UNTIL ELLEN PAO GETS IN HERE AND BANS YOU ALL FROM THE INTERNET!!!** 




 So the whole fucking narrative changes to defend the girl? 




 Really?  Well, fuck me, then. 




 Oh absolutely it's better than 90% of what's out there.  I'd even bump it up to 99%.

When I said I was disappointed in HBO's writers, it was in comparison to their own work, not others.  They've set such a high standard for themselves, I felt that they didn't live up to expectations.

It's the old Soviet factory problem.  If you work too hard, the boss expects more of you each time. 




 What a stupid fucking third grader.  Let's burn him alive as an offering to the one true god. 




 Shows like Deadwood and The Wire were near perfect.  Probably because it was original writing, and not an adaptation, I guess. 




 The last two seasons of GOT are enough to make me start losing faith in HBO writers. 




 It's overused as fuck on reddit. 




 What do you think of the Character "Sugar" on Cinemax's show Banshee? 




 LOL at the people thinking some intense badass like Vin Deisel or Jason Mamoa would be a good Shadow. 




 HBO's tv writers seem to take too many liberties with book adaptations. 




 Boss also had the problem of going up against a much more hyped up House of Cards.  Sort of a Deep Impact vs. Armageddon scenario. 




 Damn.  That's disappointing. 




 Is 99 Pedro the GOAT? 




 What is the law of the land?  I just thought that was a movie expression. 




 Why don't people finish their sentences anymore? 




 To fully embrace "The Jagr," Gore is gonna have to play for at least half the league.  At least. 




 Oh my god, how fucking seriously they take their social justice bullshit.  Crime?  Labeling any perceived offense as a crime?  And they are the arbiters of justice now?  It's up to them to decide guilt of their perceived crimes?

Fucking CRIMES?

Crime:  feelings were hurt.  Punishment:  ruin this person's life. 




 ITT:  Everybody knowsfor a fact that Lebron is being a douche on purpose, and not joking around with the opposing team's ball boy, like ALL OTHER SUPERSTARS DO, 









 New Sidebar? 




 What if someone gets offended and feels unsafe? 




 Do any of them do anal? 









 What's the difference between magnesium, magnesium citrate, and magnesium oxide?  All three are sold by the same manufacturers at health stores. 




 Lol, yeah, lots of butthurt from the fanboys.  It was just a poorly written show about a bunch of douchebags. 




 Motherfucker re-hosted the image.  My link was not purple, so I clicked. 




 You're better off fast forwarding to the good parts. 









 Jon Stewart DESTROYS conservatives with his EARTH SHATTERING DEVASTATING LOGIC!!! 




 He wrote a comment about Machida, so there's that. 









 I've read some material saying that keto is ok for diabetics, and people with kidney stones are not in any danger on this diet.  But those seemed to be opinion pieces.

Are there any hard scientific sources supporting a ketogenic lifestyle for someone with kidney stones who is borderline diabetic?

My neighbor fits into this category, and I don't want to give him wrong information.  He's been making great progress, but he told me he is pre-diabetic, has kidney stones, and gets occasional gout flareups.

He's so far done it by plain old calorie restriction, but now he wants to cut out carbs all together. 




 Waiting to rip it off and reveal an NWO shirt 




 Is this really more important than the Penis Mightier? 




 It works in so many levels! 




 Honda 




 Consummation occurred at age 9 as per Aisha's own testimony. 




 No.  I should have added /s 









 Wait, I thought that was capitalism. 




 Too many.  This is one of those bands whose albums are solid A+ from start to finish. 









 Well, the prophet, who is the ideal for mankind, did marry a 6 year old girl and consummate the marriage when she turned 9.  You know, when she was ready.

Oh, and he also forbade adoption because he wanted to marry his stepson's wife.  God ordained it, so it must be. 




 He's actually pretty decent on screen.  You realize how fucking big he is when he's on camera with the two main protagonists of the shot. 




 Why u so sexy, Machida? 




 it was fucking purple, and i still clicked 




 Bullshit 




 please use a more shadowy picture.  I almost saw something. 




 The circle of life. 




 Don't you dare blame me for my mistake! 




 I hate this cult if victimology that has been embraced by society. Nothing is ever anyone's fault.

No, OJ, it's not your fault. Nicole repeatedly ran into your knife. No, Osama, it's not your fault. Those pilots veered off course (plus jet fuel).  




 MMA MATH BRUH. COME AT ME!   MATT HAMMIL GOAT 4 LYFE!!!!! 




 Unless he loses a filler match.  Anyone remember Gus/Rumble? 




 **NEEDS MORE JPEG!!!** 




 Please, OP, we need more pixels, and preferably, a smaller sized pic as well. 




 Stockton, bitch. 




 Yes, 30 years ago, while they both had good jobs, they should have anticipated corporate downsizing decades in advance. Got it. 




 Do you have any idea how many people sacrifice their health for work because they HAVE to?  They provide for their families, pay for their own health insurance, and what not.

People will willingly work themselves to death to provide for their loved ones.

My mother worked two retail jobs to provide for her three children.  My father, still at age 70, drives 2 hours to work and back to support my mother and himself in their retirement years.  I send them whatever money I can from my own paycheck.  Their health is definitely affected.

What, pray tell, are their options? 




 I love idiots like that.  "hurr durr just leave, nobody is forcing you to work there.  get a better job.  just go out and do it!  it's that easy." 




 well, for those five years, i'll still use amazon 




 Only if they could ripoff whatever original design he came up with. 




 Lebron made it on 5 covers 




 Isn't he though?  What else do they have in their history more significant?

edit: Lol at all the butthurt Wizards fans.  Even with their championship and handful of great players, all of that combined pales in comparison to being associated with the most well recognized pro athlete in the history of this game.  




 This is some KenM level trolling right here 




 that's some [10] guy shit right there 




 Perfect, I'll inject mountain dew directly into my neck in front of my LAN buddies.  They will cower in fear.  Or defeat me with their superior immunity

 OMG your June numbers.  You poor bastard.  May God have mercy on your soul. 




 The misspelling of bodies does it for me. 




 Fuck this stupid chuck norris shit

 Stone cold 




 WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MACHIDA ERA?!?!?!?!  IT'S STILL GOING ON, RIGHT?  WE'RE STILL IN IT? 




 This is actually the only thing that I want now. 




 HOW CAN YOUR EYES BE LIKE ARPEGGIOS IF MIRRORS AREN'T REAL?!?!?!?! 




 Still waiting on the Penis Mightier 




 He was actually referring to the fact that the creator of imgur is a redditor, who explicitly created imgur for reddit. 




 no, stupid!  you only protest false rapes 




 Thanks, Hunto! 




 So, that would make three.  Two to the hands, one to the feet. 




 The only real rape that actually occurred in all of this. 




 So they stalked Gaben and decided to crash his party or something? 




 I have  a 2010 Legacy, which I love, but wanted to see about trading it in for the 2015 model.  Basically, there is nothing new here.  A little bluetooth here, some rear camera there, and that's it.  I thought that a 5 year break in between models would offer significant upgrades, or at least changes.  Everything seems the same, or just negligibly improved.  Even the gas mileage is the same.  NO IMPROVEMENTS TO MPG IN 5 YEARS?  No other car company has stagnated like that.

I guess I'll keep this one for another 120,000 miles.
