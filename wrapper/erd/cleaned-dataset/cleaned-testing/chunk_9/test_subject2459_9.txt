 I stayed lucid for, what felt like, hours. That's not a problem it's just control the dream and the environment. 




 Eviiiil!  




 In general, when you're at school or shopping or basically anywhere out of the house. 




 No, there's vehicles, you can explore pretty amazing maps and the areas aren't linear as you can tackle most using different means for example you could drive in and be loud or sneak in and be quiet. It's really fun! 




 Generally yes. Some people take 90 but it can take between 60 and 120. 




 How big of an inconvenience has having diabetes been for you? 




 YES! Halo has an incredible storyline and great characters!! One of my all time favourite games! 




 Kanye west, he'd make a HUGE deal about it!! 




 Ha, ha :) 




 Ha, ha if you look you can still see some people's faces!! 




 I never made the picture, just saw it online and grabbed it :( 









 Lets agree to disagree. 




 Structure yes, plot no. Structure- like you said smart and dumb physical and weak outcasts and have to work to get back on top yes but they have a different storyline and you're confusing that (plot) to be the same when it's the structure. 




 Like the lion king, frozen and the hunger games then. They aren't the same but have similar structure. 




 Ha! 




 Back then women were seen more as objects than people. They were there to feed the family, keep the house inviting and raise the children. Nothing more, they were essentially second class when compared to men. So it was thought that the younger the girl the more children she can have. 

This goes back further, if you look at ancient greece women were not to dabble in mens affairs (yet at the same time in troy women were living the life of luxury!!). 

Of course society progressed, things like medicine and science with it. It was realised a girl should be able to grow before birthing a child. Almost 100 years ago there were many womens rights movements like the suffragists and suffragettes. They campaigned for a womens right to vote. When they eventually gained this many continued to work after the war, even though many men thought they should be at home. It eventually became the womans choice if she wanted to work or if she wanted to give birth or both. 
 




 Not really. In MU they go to university because they're that age. In 21 js they go undercover. 




 Literature, ha! I never found that in-game, funny that they added it. 




 It's upbto you. To be honest I wouldn't get it permanently done. I pressume you're a woman? (Correct me if I'm wrong). If you shave I'd just stick with that cause you might want to grow it back in the future. But again, it's up to you. 




 Ha, ha! What game is this... eh I don't want to pl- play it. A friend asked me to ask you. Yea- yeah that's what happened a friend asked me to ask you. It was a friend... not me. A friend. 




 There's going to be a million "dick size" comments here. 




 Do reality checks throughout the day (I cover my nose and mouth) if you keep doing it you get in the habbit then if you do it in a dream you'll know you're dreaming. For example, I cover my mouth and nise but in dreams I can breathe when I do that so I realise I'm dreaming.

This [wikihow article](http://m.wikihow.com/Lucid-Dream) might help you. 

Keep a dream journal and when you wake, lie for a few minutes and think about your dream then write as many facts as you can remember down this will make future dreams more vivid.

Enjoy LD they are awesome!  




 Hey, I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/3ds0j8/i_want_to_lucid_dream_but_im_terrified_of_sleep/) yesterday, explaining that I was terrified of SP so I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who answered, I feel a lot less worried about it now.

So before I start I want to say I used to LD  as a child but never really knew how I was doing it or what was going on.

I had my first DILD (in years) last night. It was pretty cool, I was in water and realised I could breathe with my hand over my mouth and nose (my favourite reality check). I knew I was dreaming so I could now control myself but i couldn't control the area around me or do anything (like flying etc). Then I started doubting that I was dreaming and my mind kept going back and forth but I knew I was when I realised how weird my location was and that I could still breathe with my hand over my mouth. No other reality checks that I did worked (e.g putting my finger through my hand). Any way the dream lasted for a pretty long time which was cool but I was wondering how I can better control my environment in dreams and how I can do things like fly. I read that you just jump and imagine you're flying or close your eyes and imagine then when you open them you will but that never worked.

So how can I better control my dream environment?

Fly?
 




 Thank you!!  




 I actually managed to have a DILD last night when I did a reality check (covered my mouth and nose and could still breathe) no sleep paralysis!! Can you get SP through DILD or just WILD? I couldn't fully control the dream however. I could control me and knew I was dreaming but I couldn't change my surrounding (very easily) or fly etc. 




 Ha, ha!! :D 




 I managed to have an LD last night infact (no SP!!) But it was strange, I knew I was dreaming and could control myself but I couldn't controk the area around me or fly etc? 









 If thay happens you can forcefully wake yourself or make it change (difficult). 




 Lucid dreaming is when you realise that you are dreaming and can go on to control what happens in your dreams. People can train themselves to lucid dream by doing "reality checks" throughout the day. 




 r/casualconversation great bunch of people, very friendly. 




 Try taking a cold shower. I know it sounds taboo but it wakes you up, energizes you and makes you feel aware. Definitely worth trying but be careful if you have any breathing conditions. 




 If they gave consent before hand I don't see why not but if they have to get permission from their lawyers or they just do it it's unethical since the actor or actress may not have liked the project. 









 We aren't prepared. We aren't prepared!! What if they use a hoover?! Those damned feline fanatics might wish they were like our brethren but they have wits! We mustn't underestimate them! 




 Damn it! Get me dogfort we need to organise before an attack of this magnitude! 




 Wow. Sounds like there's something else. You handled it pretty good. When she cools down talk to her and see what she says. 




 But still what you're saying is wrong. 




 Honestly well done! You could have fapped and you chose not to.  




 Good post but there are many other types of people and reasons for joining nofap around here. I get that you're making a point but still... 




 Maybe you shoukd see a doctor. I don't want to sound mean or rude but I don't think nofap alone will help this. 




 Ha, ha I thought that was it but I've seen a lot of people complain about it while on hard mode 




 Yeah, the US tried to stay out of it. It was mainly a European conflict but of course the US and other countries got sucked in. 




 From what I know the flatline is when you have almost no libido. So should this not make this period easier? Unless I'm wrong and it's a period of high libido then I don't understand why so many people find it to be a period of difficulty. 




 I once fell in a pile of cow shit! Having a huge phobia of germs I ran home and showered for hours on end, got out bathed, showered again and then dried off. Even though I was fully clothed when it happened. Needless to say the clothes went in the bin. 




 Yeah it's like what happens if he gives him a hug or whatever. They're meh, derp. 




 I saw this a long time ago and laughed my ass off! 




 Walking. When I feel an urge, for the last few days I've got teady and taken the dogs for a walk. They enjoy it and it stops me from doing anything I'll regret. 




 That's to bad. Maybe you should try going back to warm and then in a week or two try cold again? 




 Awesome, count me in! 




 You too, stay strong. It's good that you stopped.  




 Hey man, good job. It's not easy to do that kinda thing. It'd be cool if you could post another picture (along side these two) in two months and show us your progress :) 




 Okaaay.  




 Did you "finish" if not I wouldn't reset, it's called edging but don't do it again. It's one of the worst things you can do since your basically teasing yourself. 




 Glad to hear it. Stay strong brother. 




 Ha, ha I'm literally just out of one. I think that's going to become my new norm. 




 Sure is, I heard it years ago but figured I'd post it anyway. 




 The Scotsman opens his lunch and says:

'Fur fuck sake if ma wife makes this pish again am gonnae jump aff this buildin'

As he looks at his ham sandwich.

Then the Englishman exclaims:

'Oh bloody hell if me wife makes this rubbish again I shall jump off of this building'

As he looks at his pickle sandwich.

Then the Irishman opens his lunch and says:

'If I get this again I'll jump off this building'

As he looks at his cheese sandwhich.

The next day they stop for lunch:

The Scotsman exclaims:

'Dumb bitch made this shite again, see yees later' and he jumps to his death.

Then the Englishman:

'Bloody hell, cheerio ol' chap' he waves to the iriishman and promptly jumps to his death.

Then Irishman:

'Ah well. It had to be cheese didn't it?'

And he jumps to his death. 

The three wives are friends and decide it's fitting to have a joined funeral.

As the Scotsmans wife and Englishmans wife mourn their husbands the Irishmans wife walks past them laughing in fits of hysteria.

This confuses them so they ask what's so funny to which she replies:

'My husband made his own sandwiches!!' 




 Ha, ha funny (I'm scottish) :D 




 Ha! Sick but ha! 




 Most people think it takes anywhere between 60 and 120 days, the most common being 90. 




 And you (yes you, I'm going to call you Mrs Pennyapple (I don't care if you're a guy you are now Mrs pennyapple)) are trying to fix that problem

I'm not going to try and say something inspirational, there are a bunch of posts there that we can all use but I am going to say well done. If you were to ask any guy to stop masturbating they'd probably laugh in your face (poor Mrs pennyapple) and if they did give it a shot they'd probably last a day and then give up and make a joke about how heavy their balls feel. But you, Mrs Pennyapple have realised and are trying to better yourself. So even if this sub is considered "weird" or "gay" or "culty" it doesn't matter because you are changing yourself for the better and they aren't. Well done Mrs Pennyapple.

Yes I posted this last night but I thought I'd add to it. Some of you aren't just struggling with PMO. You might be trying to quit weed, or videogames or maybe you want to lose weight. Yes this sub is called r/nofap but you, Mrs Pennyapple, have realised the issues affecting you and your family and friends and even if you fail at least you are making the effort to better yourself. So if you don't lose that extra belly fat, if you do play a videogame, if you do smoke a joint, if you do fap. At least you can say you tried. Yes you might fail but if you do pick yourself up and try again. Don't let it hold you back. Almost everyone here has relapsed at one point or another. Do you think those that have made it too 800 days just did that? No! They struggled and fought and made themselves do it and so can you. Keep going and you will get there, if it takes 90 days or 900 don't stop untill you reach your goal, whatever it may be. 




 Catholic here, hey. You're making the right choice. There are a few ways that can reassure you when you think of porn:

* Think of what a lot of those poor women have gone through. While many do it "for fun" a lot of pornstars were abused or are very poor. It's not nice to watch a woman struggling through life have sex on camera.

* it's essentially filmed prostitution. Would you have sex with a prostitute? Hopefully the answer is no, so why watch others?

* Sex should be private not something for the whole world to see. 

These make me think of why porn is so bad. If you do get a serious urge there are a couple of ways you can get rid of it:

* Meditate - This is VERY useful. Meditation can help you become calm and relaxed and get rid of stress (and urges). Here is a [wikihow article](http://m.wikihow.com/Meditate) that explains some basic meditating techniques. 

* Do something. Urges normally come when you have free time so take that time and use it constructively. Read a book, learn an instrument, exercise do anything to get your mind off of it. 

* All else failing install a porn blocker and randomise the password then when you get an urge put some ice cubes down your pants (this is only good at home not in public or at anyone else's house). The coldness really helps get it down. Finally if everything else has failed tell yourself you don't want to watch porn and then go for a cold shower. Seriously it helps.


Good luck.  




 I know but who cares?  




 Ha! 




 It's a website (obviously). You subscribe to subreddits which interest you (like r/gaming or r/baseball etc) there is a subreddit for virtually everything! 

Here you can talk to people with similar interests as you, trade things, ask questions (as you have done so eloquently yourself) and more!

 




 Wow! Congratulations!! That's fucking awesome! 




 You have to try them! I've heard people talk about them since I started nofap in January and last night I said fuck it. It was a pretty cold night so I wasn't sure it was a good idea but I went for it. Holy shit. It felt great, freezing, but great. Definitely try it if you haven't already. 




 No. A lot of people here have SO's. It's only an issue if you want to do "hard mode" (no porn, masturbating or sex). If you would like to do that you could tell your SO about nofap. But if you decide not to it's perfectly ok to have sex. 




 Craigslist is evil! 




 Oh my god 1.5tb of porn!? Well done for deleting it. Good luck on your journey. You did the right thing to delete all of that shit.  




 Ha, ha! I came here to try and tell you to stay strong or harden up etc but you got me! :D 




 When I get an urge I do one of two things:

1). Meditate. I use breathing meditations. It clears your mind of all thiughts (including urges) and is very effective. It's a very basic begginers guide but if you'd like to try it you can [read this wikihow article.](http://m.wikihow.com/Meditate) Like I said, it's basic but it can help you get started. Visualisation is also very useful. Lot's of people imagine that there problems are a balloon or a rock etc and they let them go or throw them away. It sounds very silly and childish but it does work.

2). If I can't meditate I change the subject in my head immediately! I don't care what too, straight away I think about school, tv, my doys! Anything that works!

Good luck, the fact that you've gone an entire day with it in your head and bot done anything about it is an achievement in itself. Just keep going.  




 Ha, ha 

 Her shit smells as bad as mine and no one's too good for me.

I like that. Thanks for the encouragement. 




 Ha, ha good luck Mrs Pennyapple! 




 I think it's because it's the social norm. It's often encouraged and people say it's healthy. Which I suppose in moderation (1-2 times a week, without porn) it could be. Peopl think because something's normal or acceptable it's ok or healthy but, like I said in the pist, I bet more guys have an addiction and don't even realise it. If they stopped I doubt they'd last. 




 Wow. Thanks!! :D 




 But you (yes you, I'm going to call you Mrs Pennyapple (I don't care if you're a guy you are now Mrs pennyapple)) have realised that you have an addiction. 

I'm not going to try and say something inspirational, there are a bunch of posts there that we can all use but I am going to say well done. If you were to ask any guy to stop masturbating they'd probably laugh in your face (poor Mrs pennyapple) and if they did give it a shot they'd probably last a day and then give up and make a joke. But you, Mrs Pennyapple have realised and are trying to better yourself. So even if this sub is considered "weird" or "gay" or "culty" it doesn't matter because you are changing yourself for the better and they aren't. Well done Mrs Pennyapple.  




 Thabks for answering. Enjoy work!  :) 




 I mean legend, anniversary and underworld. 




 Or oblivion or tomb raider  




 Almost everyone loves McDonald's but there is a definite stigma (in some areas) for people that work there. Do you feel there is a bad view for employees? 









 I like a "natural look". Skin coloured foundation and lipstick (I hate red lipstick on a girl). I also like dark eyeliner. 




 Ha, ha! 




 I know right. 




 Thank you. I did go outside and I'm going again soon. It's just walking my dogs instead of my brother doing it but it's a start. Ive played xbox today (playing it now) but I liked that article. Today I got up first thing, cleaned my room, ate breakfast and went a walk. As far as real life friends go, I had a great group but moved a while back. I have friends here but... meh. I don't know it's not the same. Plus when I did hang out with them after school one of them always wanted to talk about porn, gaming and masturbating so I think it's best I stay away from him.

I'm going to start writing again (I used to write fanfics). I don't think I can get rid of my xbox(s) but I'm going to play them less and less.  




 Hiya!! I'm Devlin, I'm 16. I love writing, tv, movies, books, gaming and music but I have a passion for history. I could talk about it forever (but I won't). I'm on kik:

DevlinFr3w99

Just send me a message here or there and we can talk :) 




 Bow and arrow. Replaying every game in the tomb raider series (yet again) and I'm on the reboot so I guess I'd use the signature weapon. 









 Hey, it's great that you're trying. I'd say the best thing you could do is 'cut out' these friends or tell them that you're trying to quit:

(1) Cutting them out:

This is extremely difficult and a hard choice to make but you should ask yourself a few questions:

A). Are they toxic?- - -Is there any possible way I can be around them and not smoke weed?

B). Are they really friends? - - - I don't know how far back you guys go back but ask yourself if they're really friends. One way to do this is to think if they've been there for you during hard times.

C). Would your life really change without them?

(2). Tell them you're trying to quit. If they're your friends they'll understand and won't get high when you're there, maybe they could quit with you?

I know better than anyone how hard it can be to make friends (past experiences) but it's possible. I don't know how old you are. If you're in high school try joining a club or finding people with similar interests as you. If you aren't in school or college try going online and meeting people in your area, this one can be a bit awkward but it's possible. 

Also pot isn't actually addictive, it has no addicive properties other than the fact that you enjoy it but it doesn't have addictive properties like heroine. 

Good luck and you're doing great quiting porn and going even further by quiting weed. Great job so far!! 














 Ha, ha someone else already asked but sure go ahead :) 









 Maybe it's not for you. That's fine, you can continue fapping but if you do I'm asking you not to watch porn. It sets unrealistic standards for what men expect, many of the women were/are sexually/physically/emotionally abused (I know lots aren't but you never know what people have gone through). It's someone's daughter, if you have one really think about what you would feel like if someone was fapping over her. Of course it's up to you but those are the negatives to porn. 




 Don't get me wrong I am not depressed. I love life but I've taken a look at it and I feel empty. I don't know if that's the right word. For context I'm in my teens, high school, and I feel like I've wasted this summer holiday. I've lain around the whole time on xbox and I've done nothing that'll make it memorable. I love gaming but I just find it so boring (I have for the last two days). I've never felt this way before. 

I keep saying I'm going to go outside a little more each day (since I spend a lot of time inside but I have asthma and it got pretty bad the other week to the point were I could barely breathe. I know I'm using that as an excuse since I feel much better now. I'm going to go outside tomorrow 100%

I can't really describe this but I feel angry since I know I failed my exams. I haven't had the results yet but I failed the mock exams which should've been a wake up call but... here I am. I can still pas  if I really focus next year. 

I realise this is just a rant but I don't know what to do. For the first time in years I'm really, really bored. Xbox normally keeps me happy and failing that a good book or movie but nothing's working! 

I have to thank nofap, however. I started this In January and have had some pretty good streaks but then I've quit and came back a few times. This is the first I've felt like this and even though I don't like it now I'm glad I do because I can see that I need to get my shit together. I've also meditated on and off but I'm back on that, thank you nofap. I intent to fix all of this crap. Tonight I'm turning off my xbox, going to sleep and waking up fresh and ready for whatever I decide to do first.  




 Ha, ha awesome. I wonder what he went on to do. 




 Ha, ha prove it! Marry me?! 




 Ha, ha female humans, do you enjoy this "subreddit" on the internet machine at the domain which your species calls "reddit?" 




 Yeah, I did. I really just said "gals". 




 So-so sometimes it's organised an  fun others not so much. Cyrodiil is also a great place to quest but also dangerous. You don't need a group but I recommend one. 









 When in pvp stay with other players. If you go off on your own you will likely fie. Th  larger the group the better. Try and fight others around your level, that's not to day don't figbt back against a higher level but don't actively seek them out. 

Use all of your offence and defence abilities. A good idea is to have your main hand for offence and your second hand (unlocked at level 15) for defence. 

Practice makes perfect. Th  more you play the better you'll get. 




 I'm the youngest of 6 children so my mum was in her early 40's at the time and my dad his late 40's. I honestly don't remember most of the dream that vividly but I remember the fear the room gave me and when my mum told me she had it too. I mainly remember the cloak and choking. 




 Yeah, I'm flattered. I never really thought much of it. Use a head. 









 This is my exact post from r/paranormal can anyone tell me ***anything*** about what this could mean?

When I was a kid my family and I moved to the countryside. For the first four years we lived in a small town which was fine but we eventually moved, quite litterally to the middle of nowhere. It was this one street town with like 4 houses. It was ok because I spent most of my time indoors anyway (I've always been indoors-ey).
The house we were living in was big, much bigger than anything I had ever stayed in before (before we moved to the countryside we lived in a suburban area of a city with a pretty big home, then a small town, then the middle of nowhere). Most of the bedrooms were upstairs but there was one down stairs. Everytime you went in it it was cold, when I say cold I mean it felt like ice, you could always see your breath. So, as a rule, I stayed out of there. The rest of the house was awesome and my brothers and sisters and I had a pretty cool time living there but I started getting horrible feelings whenever I went near the cold room:
My eyes would water like I was going to cry, I would get a sore chest. I always tried to keep myself calm by explaining to myself that it was just me, I got a sore chest because of my asthma, I had watery eyes because of some other reason I'm sure I found less than convincing.
The part that gets creepy was when our kitchen was being remodeled. Because of the layout of the kitchen we had to move the fridge into the cold bedroom untill the remodelling was finished. I couldn't stand going in there and eventually I straight out refused. You see I spend a lot of time with my two dogs (who were younger at the time) since I'm almost always inside and whenever they went near that room they would show their teeth and raise their hackles, which they virtually never do.
One night I fell asleep and had this nightmare. In it I went into the room to get something as fast as I possibly could but then the door slammed shut and I couldn't open it for the life of me. On the other side my brother was trying to force it open. Then this man appeared he was clothed in a huge black cloak and started mumbling words I couldn't make out before he started choking me. I woke up coughing like mad and had, what I call, a "mini" asthma attack. I told my mum the next morning and she starred as if looking through me not at me. Then she said:
'XboxG4mer I had the exact same dream'
She never wanted to freak me out so straight away she comforted me by telling me it was just a dream. I kept having the same nightmare and I never asked her but I think my mum did too because after a couple of months we moved away.
The man in the dream was old but looked wholly evil. I don't know what happened in that house but there was something about that room. Nothing could warm it and the eery sensations I got when near it were stronger than any I've ever felt.
EDIT 1: So a few of you said I should look into it and see what I can find. When I did a quick google of the street it turned up nothing and gave me the names of nearby locations. I'll update again soon.
EDIT 2 So I found it on the googs (sounds weird, google sounds better). However it only spoke about how the "village" once had a larger population, a school and a train station etc but after the coal mining industry in the area was done many people moved and full streets lay empty. I knew all of this and when I say full streets I mean like 15 houses maybe 20, barely anyone lives there today. 




 Wow. In my dream I lost my breath in the room aswell and he, I call him he but most of his face was covered by the cloak, just began relentlessly choking me. I wonder if they were to do with the house?  




 Could you link me to the app? 




 Awesome. Enjoy it and stay safe out there. 




 Ha, ha good one :) 




 Can I ask: how did you do that? Drawing? Computers? Either way thank you so much!! 




 Oh my god that is so fucking awesome, thank you!! :D 




 I've started looking into it, I'll keep you all posted :) 




 Ha, ha I doubt it'd be very interesting just an old house with a cold room and some creaky floors :) I'll see what I can find out about it though.
 




 No. Not since I moved. She never had it blessed and while she doesn't talk about it a lot I know my mum's had some paranormal experiences. I checked and the house was built during world war 2.
 




 I could check. I know some people that live near there. I never really thought about it. I've wondered if I maybe caused it. At the time I was maybe eleven? Twelve? One of them and I ha  been reading (quite a bit about astral projection). I decided (because of religious reasons) not to go through with it but I tried one day. Maybe it's related, maybe not?
