 thats almost the benefit of living in an autocratic society 




 MARTA needs to rival DC and/or Boston

Make it happen! 









 LEAKING DOCUMENTS YOU HAVE NOT READ IS NOT WHISTLEBLOWING 




 Because they ferry stolen documents. Its not that hard to understand. 




 IF you're a man raping little boys it is... 




 This doesn't change what Maduro said in the WaPo article.  




 Doesn't matter. Private information is private info 




 you do realize it is illegal to jail a reporter until he gives up his source, right? look up Shield Laws and what they're about.


Actually its not. 


Stealing medical records is a HUGE no-no 




 Thats not the problem. Private medical information is just that.  




 HIPAA exists to fully prevent this. Its totally illegal. heads should roll over this.  




 I'd sue. 



















 its only because Russia is on the security council  




 Here we go! 






















































 why is he not stalling? 









 19 monuments. The most of any president ever 


































 Duh. Its basically everything you need in a box without thinking about what you need 









 Oh this is golden 




 such an elite artist 




 Drake's versatility should really make everyone worried out here 



















 is this all fight talk? 




 he's relatively young too so his post-presidency will be very interesting 




 Yeah they have. All the time. 



















 how the entire hell is this "black american" culture?  




 this isn't "black culture"  














 its too niche of a place to just have random people stopping by 









 The reality is that there are only a tiny handful of schools even worth attending.

Eh...I'd say depending on what you major in, that statement changes 




 They knew EXACTLY what to wear  




 This was no more prevalent than when that PoS Chuck Johnson was on here 




 This REALLY is starting to piss me off about Joe...like sometimes I legitimately think he's a bit of a racist who gets away with the "I'm a comedian" card but he's clearly not pushing those limits that frequently or that flagrantly so I tend to just overlook it. 

But you can't tell with what sounds like fake enthusiasm sometimes. Its an important subject but many times it sounds like Joe flat out disagrees with these same talking points with a different guest. 




 I know people think this, but its really not true. 

It CAN be true, but many cultures, including even the USA, have notions of masculinity in which homosexuality isn't really accepted. In the USA at least we're ***tolerant***...in other countries, gays are seen as a distraction and a weakness in the image of the nation-state. Its prevalent in nations that don't have their shit together, but to say that these people are secretly dreaming of gay men is untrue. A lot of it is religiously based and a lot of it is flat out hatred of gays...you don't have to be exhibiting Ego-dystonic sexual orientatio to do this.  














 HOW SWAY?! 




 I have no problem with that considering its the US HQ 




 They can't go against the popular vote if the margins aren't close. 

Gore v Bush was only so significant because the race was so close 

















































 Way too low. Easily deserves a 8.5+ 




 
HE ADMITTED TO ENGAGING IN BRIBERY HIMSELF!



I'm sorry you don't know anything about this guy's background. He's as crooked as everyone else.  




 he admitted to stealing tons of money in order to become an informant though and avoid charges himself 




 because he admitted to taking bribes 









 One of the GOAT presidents 




 ....and back to nihilism 




 Can you really use the tix for both events??? 




 One of the best episodes in the entire JRE history.  




 Looks like I've found the white guy.  









 I used to think it was Engadget until The Verge came along...but now The Verge is branching out too much and I feel like it isn't focused on pure tech anymore...so where is the general populace left?

 The Saudis spend too much money to be embarrassed like this 




 why is there video where there is video? 




 However, he will not have to serve his sentence because a statute of limitations kicks in later this year before any appeal can be held, preventing the courts from pursuing the case further.

#**LOL** 




 I'm looking to secure some free ones if possible to pack items into 









 I'd love to see what classifies as "life" to them and how far they take that 
























 Whats the worst that could have happened? Suffocation? 









 She's holding out for the primary 




 they've made mountains fly with mustard sauce or something 





























 You can buy "made in china" if you really want to 









 They actually *can...* 







































 Norway has 5 million people. 




 I don't care if Joe laughed.  




 No. People were upset. People aren't pretending. It was offensive and it wasn't' funny.  




 So what?

The internet saw it.

Didn't like it.

And she got taken to task for it.

Too bad. 

Twitter isn't your written diary.  









 Not tolerating intolerance. Gotcha.  









 GODDAMN 




 I swear to  god ^(whatever you believe in) Shure needs to revamp these cables. Its such a big complaint on here.  




 I don't care if it was justified.

She got bad to worse in her responses.

Of course people don't deserve to be told they're going to get raped...but that doesn't mean she should keep her job either 




 why is ok for white people to continually actively hate anyone thats not them? 




 Solving problems includes calling out jackasses.  




 Who cares if it "fixed" anything?

She said something dumb and the internet took her to task for it. 

it wasn't funny and it wasn't appropriate, especially for someone who worked as a Chief of Public Relations 




 Well yeah, thats exactly what I'm saying.

Theres protections in place legally, but you can't work in public relations then act surprised when the internet doesn't respond favorably to your "joke" 




 Actually, in a world where everyone has a voice, you're just hearing more voices. Just because their issues don't apply to you doesn't change what they deem to be important.  




 The government didn't challenge anything. The public did. 

Theres no foul here. 

If you want to make jokes, and unpopular opinions, be prepared to encounter those who find fault with what you have to say 





























 Then thats her fault for thinking the internet was supposed to respect her. She put that out into the world.

The only thing we're arguing is whether or not people should have ignored her...and once its online, thats not up to her.  




 I disagree. 

Online, its out there for the world to see and ultimately you leave yourself open to THE WORLD to interpret anything and everything you say. Different demographics will interpret everything differently and a lot of people live in this bubble free from acknowledging how other people really view things. There are some people in the south who LEGITIMATELY don't even view the confederate flag in a negative light...these people haven't seen or been exposed to other view points that challenge their own

When you rush to online expressions, be prepared for any and all backlash. 
 














 I need this "in my life"  




 MAJOR 





























 This is great...but...

Seriously...whats the deal with all this talk about SJWs instead of calling out people for actually saying ridiculous things that deserve ridicule? Its like Joe et al doesn't enjoy being called out or held accountable.  Justine Sacco said something that was incredibly offensive and yet its everyone else's fault for putting her out of a job. Not to mention she's a rich little girl who worked in public relations herself, but its always the P.C. culture for some reason. 



No ones rights are being violated.  




 do you have the floorplan? Ive been looking at this place online for months 






















































 Why? 

WHY?! 




 This will be a massive failure. 

They all have the same interests and basically hate each othe 









 Tomorrow is gonna be wild 




 Good God 














 This.

Theres a lot of weapons charges tied in with those 














 Actually, its necessary

See, the world is moving very quickly and advantages enjoyed by leading nations now can easily disappear if not "managed" so yes, leveraging your influence into more favorable deals matters for all of us. 

Its sheer geopolitics.  




 This was incredibly petty of all parties  




 Always the nation.

When you're dealing with international forces, you have to look at things on a bigger scale 




 Free trade is going to need to happen in a globalized economy. You can't escape it 




 This seriously pisses me off.

I wish he'd start his own blog. Its all i'd read from that damn site anyways
 




 hahahahahahah 




 Free Speech isn't leaking government documents. 

 




 I don't even know how'd he'd be safe IN Ecuador since the nation itself probably couldn't protect him 




 How petty are some redditors? 









 no south sudan either 




 Racism doesn't apply to religion 




 SHUT. THEN. DOWN 




 GODDAMN! 




 THIS!

I swear when I was younger, navigating the MTV website was a MAJOR pain in the ass 




 Whats the deal with Don Lemon?
