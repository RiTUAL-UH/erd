 Hey there everyone!

I was wondering, how should we approach small businesses, or maybe even larger ones, for research and information (example: for the EE)? Do you have any wisdom to share? Tips, advice? Share please :)
Thanks :) 




 Don't you wish this was more common? Anyone disagree? 




 Hey there my fellow dwellers of the IB,

I know some of you may also be interested, could we discuss how to formulate an ee economics question. What did you look for, what criteria did you have when thinking of a question?

Hope your IB is going not terribly, wish you an above average day in IB! 




 I'm just concerned on self improvement overall. Knowing more about myself is something I think would do so. Thank you for the response :) 




 Thanks for the response. Do you suggest either psychologist or counsellor? 




 Academically, I believe I am not getting the grades I can, and was wondering if meeting a psychologist or psychiatrist would help.

Socially I do have numerous sociopathic (lack of empathy, selfish, confused) tendencies, and was wondering if that too could be something. 














 Hey there
I am debating whether I should go to a psychologist to discuss (not sure how to describe) about how to improve myself. Deep down, I kind of believe it to be  useless. Could you  please explain why that may not be the case. 




 Hey r/IBO!
I cannot think of a topic that is within our syllabus (SL) and that makes any sense. Could you please help me find something. For example, the '4 colour theory' that many of you may know off, is interesting - but how exactly does one write a math IA about it? I do not understand. :(

 I'm interested in many different areas so hopefully this shouldn't be too hard.
Areas I am interested in:
Investing/stock market (anything really)
Economics - (more macro)
Rocket launches and rockets generally
History (ww1, ww2)
Military of armies
Nukes 
4 colour theory (Plan B) 




 Why would you ask this question? What are your reasons for or against? What made you believe you should ask this question? Please lay out your rationale. 




 Finally someone spoke out! :D

Please send me a link if there is one! 




 Why is there a noob question in ADVANCEDentrepreneur? 




 This sub-reddit has great content, but lacks comments! What do you guys think about Macau? I personally wonder, is comparing Macau to Vegas reasonable in long term projections? Or are they too different?  




 Than you. This is the kind of response im looking for. 




 No, I want a biography. I already read II and will start SA. 




 Because time is a scarcity ;)

I did, but wanted to ask here too 




 Hey r/investing!
