 Yet most republican voters blame Obama for being a socialist. Ironic? 




 Might want to start now. Everyone in your position will be doing the same exact thing once that happens. 




 Blame the younger generation who are stuck with the idea that their vote doesn't matter. 



















 An athletic department spokesperson told the Journal-World on Friday that the situation regarding furloughs would have minimal impact for KU athletics because of the limited number of state employees on the payroll.

I call bullshit on this one. 



















 I live in a college town and during the first month of move-in and class starting, you will see cops (homeless people) laying down in truck beds, along the busy streets, holding up speed detectors in a paper bag. 









 Sorry about that. I had copied the text directly from the article and did not notice.  





























 BCBS here and the site shows a 30+% increase on individual coverage.
 



















 Flew last week. My watch set off the detector. The fact I had scissors, [pepper spray](http://www.womenonguard.com/mace-keyguard-self-defense-spray-pink), and tweezers in my carry-on bag never alerted them while scanning my luggage. 

 




 Wonder what was going through the lady's mind when she decided to recycle it. Must not have taken in to consideration the fact that it says Apple Computer and looks ancient. 


































 There's a huge difference between calling something a pizza when it is actually a deep dish pizza.  






















































 Oriental Bistro has excellent sushi and for a decent price.  




 First Management owns most properties in Lawrence. Do whatever you can to avoid them. They rob you of your money and keep your deposit for the most ridiculous things. 




 Tall muscular nerd with genetically tanned skin.

Checkmate! 




 He's working by himself and making a few bucks as he goes. It isn't a lot but we can manage. I was able to support myself before we met and can do so while we are together. She is just stuck on the idea that if I'm not marrying someone who is already making six-figures, then he isn't worth it.  




 Whoa there. You might want to back up real slowly and leave this comment thread before I whoop your ass.  




 Yeah, pretty much. She has a lot of talent when it comes to art and singing, but she is stuck with the idea that you can't do hobbies for a living. So instead of doing something she enjoys, she works for someone else and hates her job.  




 High five and an upvote for surviving the crazy fucking weather that blew through last night!  




 It's hard not to when she complains that her mother did the same thing to her yet she inflicts it upon you. Hypocrisy at its best! 




 My mom always told me sex was bad and it's the only thing guys every want.

Found out last year that she had cheated, for 13 years, on the guy I knew as my Dad. So for her, sex is ok as long as it is with a wealthy man and you're cheating on a guy who thinks he is your father.   




 Both, but not the amount my mom would prefer.  




 We live in Kansas. Few people are smart or rational until you travel north to the KC metro. 

I'm both joking and serious.  




 Step 1: Do or make something using colored pencils 

Step 2: Become famous

Step 3: Show the bitch who's boss.  




 I have and she doesn't care. Her perspective on life is that you can't do what you love for a job, no one can do that, and that you are supposed to hate what you are doing.

He loves computer science.

I love helping people. I am going back to school in the fall to complete courses in psychology and art. In the end I hope to have a *Masters of Arts in Counseling with Clinical Mental Health Counseling and Art Therapy Specializations* (program offered at a grad school in Seattle)  




 He cooks and we both do chores. My mom's just a bitch. She said that she would be "ok with it" if we were married. We haven't gotten married because we wanted to wait until his work started taking off. It has and will be phenomenal once everything is up and running.  




 We both have jobs, but his is writing codes and all of that fancy computer science stuff. To her, that isn't a job. She'd rather see him working at McDonalds than doing something that he has a passion for and has been doing since his childhood.  




 My mom also got on to me about how guys only wanted one thing from girls. In high school it was sex. As an adult, it's stealing your money. 

Edit: typo 









 The link doesn't take you to the survey results.  




 WTF kind of response is that?  


































 Ahh ok. For some reason I thought it was their Monday special taco pack. Are the tacos $1 or less?  




 I was so excited to try Crimson and Brews. Not knowing that they do not offer food to go...seeing as it is a bar and all, I was out of luck and went for shitty tacos.

No food to go because...tacos + beer = mucho dinero. 

 














 Where in Lawrence is this special available besides Taco Johns and Taco Bell? 

*Burrito King is on Monday

 The study shows that this applies to African Americans and rural Africans.  





























 There's a hotel called Big Bears on Top in Key West (or there used to be). Always make me thing of it when seeing this picture. 




 Kansas isn't boring. I've lived in the Wichita and KC area my entire life and the weather makes living here suck.

Also the fact, that we're land locked, have no access to fresh sea food, and a lot of the population comes off as being ignorant. 

 




 This post reminds me of a yahoo chat room from the late 90s and early 2000s.

 




 Yes. It's Henry Reich, the host of minutephysics and MinuteEarth. 
























 I get what you are saying and you make a valid point, but using glass bottles seems like it would cause a safety concern. Especially with the parenting skills shown by today's parental figures. 














 You..you stole it from me ;'-(!!!!

Nah, no worries. Thanks for the up vote and spreading the word on such a serious subject matter.  




 The plastic breaks down into about the size of a sand granule. So if you take a sample of sand, how much of it would turn out to be plastic? 

Watch the documentary "Tapped" it goes in to a lot of detail about this. 




 Someone submitted it yesterday. I found out after submitting it to the subreddit. The mod username looks similar to yours o_O 




 Thanks for the info!

I've already competed a poetry course (hippy GTA and laid back environment = awesomeness to the max) and I'm enrolled in Abnormal Psych for the fall semester. Personality Psych with Dr. Illardi was great and I can't wait for Abnormal Psych to start. 




 How I see it, glass might be a safety hazard. Last thing you would want to have happen would be kids playing with broken bottles. 




 Took that class for my first bachelors. Loved that class! He was one of my top favorite teaches. 
























 Nah, a Necromancer would be my top choice. 
 




 I'll go ahead and do that. Wanted to give this a try.....
