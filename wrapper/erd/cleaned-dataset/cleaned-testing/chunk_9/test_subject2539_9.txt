 The Fast and The Furious 2001 was a very successful hit. 




 I like his first three albums 




 I started Blood Meridian today after only having read The Road. Already loving it. 




 Malekith and the Ronan were practically the same character 




 You're the shitty son 




 Our dad eh? What a great guy 




 I love how good he is, but how sad he looks. If I had such talent id be smiling everywhere  




 Which ones specifically? Have the hardcover and stalled at about 150 pages in. 




 Going in with a couple waivers, which bases are off the list? 




 Well I saw it 3 years ago 




 This post will get quoted after the next school shooting 




 fuck that, he coulda died. no one would have accused him of submitting. 




 Make sure you actually like her. I dated a girl for a whole year because I convinced myself I loved her. Huge waste of time. 




 To live happy for as long as I can. To never find myself being mediocre or perpetually unhappy. To be able to look back on my life on my death bed and smile.

After this there is nothing, so the purpose is to enjoy this as much as possible, while not infringing on others life experience. 




 Good luck!

Also, if you ever dont feel like going to the gym, remember that once your there its easier. Do just force yourself to make that drive. 




 Before and after pics 




 You dont look thirty, and you arent ugly 




 stumbled upon this subreddit right now and this is one of the top posts of the day.

OP, seriously? You are not ugly, you cute as fuck. Shit. Im kinda hoping the other posts have more attractive people to stare at.

 




 The economy isn't shit right now. Well, at least corporate profits aren't shit right now. The market is at the highest it's ever been. 




 Preface: I only watch the playoffs, so the last time I've watched was about a year ago.

Watching this first round and I see a shitload more traveling not getting called. Was the rule changed? 




 Sounds like you don't want to go.

Dont go.

Support your wife, and go to school while she's active. 




 If an optometrist told you you were blind, believe him. 




 "you thought id leave without saying goodbye?" 




 This is r/boxoffice we have like four things we can talk about, OW, WW, domestic, and bombs and budgets. 




 Surprise of the summer? 




 I remember tuning in for a couple weeks to watch Journeyman. Then one day it wasn't on. No explanation :( That's when I found out hoe tv worked 




 No, it got $788 million. Plus, this one had Imax. 




 Is your MEPS station really far from you? Because if they have to fly you/put you in a hotel, you would probably do everything in one visit.

But if you're close to your station, like I was, you just go on seperste days to do things.

I say research all the jobs military.about.com and the branch websites. 




 What branch are you going into? 




 Only thing I care about celebrities, is what their next project is.

"Oh, Ben Affleck cheated on his wife? What film was he working on?" 




 $115 million. Love that season. 




 While active duty can I have my mom on my healthcare? Thank you. 




 I remember almost 7 years ago in ninth grade seeing on yahoo news the weekend box office results, I think it was I Am Legend that was on top, and ever since that I would check the box office every monday, eventually finding boxofficemojo and checking daily.

I dont even know why I care 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/306grn/is_a_billion_guaranteed_for_furious_7/ 




 Yup. This franchise has been on an upward climb for years. It's not just the Ledger Effect. 




 xmas season box office is different, it isnt about blockbuster opening weekends, it is about amazing holds. 
domestic:

$115 million opening weekend (shattering previous record)

$80 million second weekend

$580 million final domestic gross.

International I have no idea. lets say, enough to get it to $1.7 billion WW total 




 If anything itll just mean a higher sunday 




 I agree, except the WW total, $1.68 billion 




 sometimes you do the whole thing at once, asvab, medical, swear in. But my process went: Speak to recruiter, take online pre-test, schedule real ASVAB at MEPS, take test, wait for results, then almost a month later I went in to take my medical and swear in. 




 "I am groot"

read it in any voice 




 Because the conservative party combined religious "morality" with financial "freedom". They prey on the weakminded. 




 We bout to see a dozen Riddick sequels 




 Lol, why call out Ron specifically? 




 Anyone could have played groot 




 You really must like westerns lol.

The Painter by Peter Heller was very enjoyable too. 




 Devil InThe White City is one of those books that deserves all its accolades. 




 The Road. I didn't want it to end. 




 Oh ok 




 What does your skin color have to do with anything? 









 So when I go to the gym, I look like a thug?


Thanks white people  




 Context clues man, obviously Avengers 2 is going to not be the least grossing MCU film
 




 I guess I just dont like his writing style. Read three pages of Survivor and you will understand what I mean. 




 Thats not what they said at all. You might be confusing their domestic predictions for worldwide numbers. 




 Not really young adult, but if you're looking for funny stuff about young people, read Tina Feys Bossypants. Yes she's forty years old, but the book is mostly about her youth. 




 To save everyone some time, dont read Palahnuik. Every book reads the same, all of them trying to recreate Fight Club. Just dont waste your time. 

Source, ive read Choke, Survivor and Fight Club 




 Thank you, you answered my second question perfectly 




 He said he went to seal school, he didnt say he passed 




 Civil War will be huge. Iron Man 3 numbers, maybe a little more. Depends on 2016's economy. 




 I'm from Florida and at the time hurricanes were a guaranteed yearly event, only those who lived through Andrew actually feared the storms. My question, among your classmates, family, friends, were hurricanes a thing to fear? Did the general populace actually know how distructive the things can be? 




 Nope. I say: 90 percent of the firsts gross.

Reasons: I dont think it will be good, the trailers them selves dont scream "must watch" if anything, people are watching just because they've seen the eight other marvel films.

The first one made a lot of money.

A lot.

Many things had to go right for it to go like that, and I dont see those same things happening again.

One thing that might prove me wrong, there's no competition. Mad Max ain't doing shit to Avengers, so it will have some time to gross freely.

 




 I thought that was the usual strategy when it came to things like this.
