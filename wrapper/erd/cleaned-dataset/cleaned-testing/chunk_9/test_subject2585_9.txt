 Your vagina is very compact - my gyno 




 I've drowned myself in a bottle of wine tonight. I feel so alone, i just want to get away from everyone and everything. I can't help myself anymore.  




 Thanks x 




 Hi all, I have just purchased some John Frieda volumising shampoo and conditioner and some hair mousse. I have only tried it a few times, and had not much change so was wondering if anyone had any ideas onto a to create more volume in hair. My hair is bum length, red/Brown and never coloured before, it's quite dull and flat too. 

Thanks :)  




 Thanks everyone. You've all really helped :) 




 Thanks so much xx 




 Thank you :)
