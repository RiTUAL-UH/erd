I like squirrels a lot and idk I sleep a lot 




 Let's play a game called "how hard can I roll my eyes" 




 Shake it Out - Florence and the Machine 




 For some context: four years ago my friend's older sister died from cancer. All three of us are into marching band. Then the other day he was driving me home and said "Ya know, when I see you I don't even miss my sister. I don't need to go visit her or think about her because it's like she's right next to me again. You're both so dedicated to what you do, and you both make an effort to be kind to everybody." And I cried 




 If you greet me with "Hi." I'll get annoyed too, it just seems unfriendly. I wouldn't answer like that because it's bitchy and she still shouldn't have said that, but yeah. 




 My school would never be having that. We have a gay-straight alliance and a really LGBT-positive atmosphere. If any group were to exclude a group of people like that, it would be shot down so fast. It blows my mind that anyone thinks that's okay.

 They're on vine and they're literal trash but girls still love them

Cat. 




 I've only had one (but it was very minor) and I literally didn't feel a thing. Don't worry. 




 Idk what happened between 11th and 12th but I'm so jealous

 You regularly get your eyebrows done. Cuz they're on fleek.

 ??? Why does that bother you? There are very few people on my bus that sit in the same exact spot every day. I have a seat that I prefer but if someone sits there I just shrug it off and sit somewhere else. 




 I was just there this weekend for a marching band thing! The campus is sooo beautiful. 




 I'll think about it! I have to make it out of high school first haha 




 University of Michigan or UCLA, then med school at Harvard (but that won't happen) 




 15 wasn't horrible IMO but I'm dumb. 19 year old you can hmu tho  




 Favorite: Spanish or German
Least favorite: French. It just sounds ew to me. 




 Sorry I forgot that I was obligated to like everything that everyone else finds fun. My bad. 




 Be careful. It effects some people differently than others. I did it one time and while my friends were all having fun, I kept hearing things that weren't there and I couldn't swallow or stand up or move my feet. Personally I hate it because it has that effect on me. It's really unlikely that will happen to you but just be careful. If you decide to do it and stuff like that happens then just lay down and be calm.  




 It seems like people either thought the reading/writing was hard and the math was easy or vice versa. Like, I had no problems with the vocabulary. But the hexagon can go fuck itself. 




 The conversation went:
"Did you not have enough time to do them?"
"No I did"
"THEN WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT"
"Eh" 




 Maybe you should have taken classes from young sensei. 




 I'M TOO JEALOUS THO. My eyebrows are extremely thin so there's not much I can do with then, and they're also kind of like, half eyebrows. And they're blonde. So I pretty much don't have any. 




 "Nah I'm good at math I don't need to look at the practice test"
*leaves a quarter of the math portion blank because I'm a dumbass.*

Also, for the non multiple choice math portion, my friend wrote 21 for every single one. Okay. 




 Eyebrows on fleek 




 7:30 AM tomorrow ;-;

But at least I get to go to another school for half the day and see my other friends 




 Being an ass to substitute teachers who already get ridiculed all day by students. Nice going, dude. 




 The Captains.

And the other school in my district is the slightly lamer Corsairs. 




 How can school lunch be real if our eyes aren't real 




 If he's comfortable sitting alone and doesn't look lonely it like he wants to talk to anyone, just leave him alone. 




 Pediatrician 




 I loooove Paramore. I saw them live this summer. Easily in my top 5 favorite bands. 




 Honestly you don't need a $100 calculator for the PSAT. You can go buy a cheap scientific calculator at Walmart for 15 bucks: 




 I've been listening to a lot of Deer Tick lately. I found him because Watsky sampled him but I fell in love with his music. It's really Bob Dylan-ish 




 She might just assume it was an accident. That's happened to me before where I accidentally get tagged in pictures and I just figure it was accidental and I delete my own tag. 

If it makes you feel any better, my friends were Facebook stalking my band director and they accidentally tagged one of them in his profile picture. 




 It's not always caused by things, in most cases it's kind of just there.

But yeah tbh a couple times a week I'll get really really down and kinda just lay on the floor all day. I used to be on the medication but then it made me gain a ton of weight. So. Yeah. 




 http://open.spotify.com/user/1218887343/playlist/5IBZ2VyOFtll1a0KHK1Pun

I have music from every genre but there's 70 hours worth. So. Yeah.

EDIT: Keep in mind I first made this when O was in eighth grade 




 Deer Tick
Watsky (idk if that counts he's gotten more popular lately??)
Tallest Man On Earth
The Rosebuds
Foxygen 




 Don't - Ed Sheeran 




 That wouldn't fly at my school hahaha 




 Parenthood 




 Sitting, Waiting, Wishing by Jack Johnson. Yeah. 




 Annamarie225 16/f 

I like books and music and tv and animals. I do competitive robotics and marching band. I'm also bored out of my mind so plz.  




 Shout out from 3098! 3 




 Why

What makes you think that's a good idea 




 I'm one of the 15 people at my school choosing to take the PSAT (most people don't because it costs money and we're an ACT state) and I'm not planning on studying much. I got a practice booklet to look over and that is probably all I will do. Remember it's just a practice test. It's meant to prepare you for the real thing, not to be the real thing. 




 Nice Fox by The Rosebuds or San Fransisco by Foxygen 




 We have a big homecoming every year and I have never went because I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't want to be grinded on in front of my English teacher. 




 We watched a short documentary in sociology today called Behind the Swoosh. It's about how badly Nike mistreats their employees and what it's like for people in sweatshops that make all of your "Made in China" or "Made in Indonesia" etc products. It's kind of eye opening and I've been viewing everything differently since I saw it.

"Some men die under the mountain just looking for gold, some die looking for a hand to hold." -Archers by Brand New

"You are my sweetest downfall." -Samson by Regina Spektor

"When papa is gone, he will never be gone, because the sound of our sneeze is the same." - Wounded Healer by Watsky 




 I had no idea what that blue button was so I would always click it and just make stupid faces in the camera but then I found out what it was and I almost cried bc I did that ALL the time. 




 [Yooo](http://i.imgur.com/hUY7zOr.jpg) 




 Nothing will ever go exactly how you picture it 




 Brand New and Iron and Wine 




 Bitches: I'm still sad
Roses: Parenthood season 5 is on Netflix so that's cool 




 Well currently I've been obsessively listening to Stolen Dance by Milky Chance buuut my favorite song of all time is probably Forever Young by Bob Dylan 




 Deja Entendu - Brand New 




 Such Great Heights - Iron and Wine 




 Same! 




 Okay! Thank you so much, I appreciate it! 




 Thank you! Yeah it was really cheap and his tinny sounding speakers. It was all I could afford at the time so I went ahead and got it. What kinda do you suggest? I'm sorry I'm so dense sounding, I just blindly went into this because I had a Bon Iver record laying around not being used and I'm really into it now. 




 I just bought a Sylvania turntable, and being the clutz that I am, I broke the needle. I have no idea on where to start replacing the needle. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/UW1aVbF.jpg) is what it looks like. If it's relevant, the model is a STT08USB. I'm just wondering if anyone knows what to do with it, because I would really like to have it fixed. Thank you!
