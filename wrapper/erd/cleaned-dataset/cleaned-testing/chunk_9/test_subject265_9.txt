 Why not both?  




 I'm still waiting for my identification pony.  




 Of course not. He didn't tank his personal finances. He tanked his company [four times.] (http://thelawdictionary.org/article/how-is-donald-trump-able-to-file-for-bankruptcy-so-many-times/)  




 Senator John McCain's war record is astonishing. His aircraft was the one that inadvertently ignited the fire that burnt the USS Forrestal to the waterline. While it was in dry dock, he volunteered to serve on a squadron fighting in Vietnam. He was on his 23rd mission of that tour when he was informed that his unit was being tracked by enemy radar. He remained with his formation and dove to deliver his payload. It was during this time that he was shot down. He fractured both arms and a leg ejecting from his aircraft. He spent the next six years imprisoned as a POW. Two of which were spent in solitary confinement. He was offered release because of his father's high rank, but refused to leave without the rest of the POWs. 

Donald Trump is a pompous blowhard who has no experience with the military, veterans, or. Politics in general.  




 Conservatives don't watch The Daily Show. They can't stand the sound of people they disagree with.  




 Senator John McCain was one of the few Republican senators to support the reasonable veteran's funding legislation last year. He actually cosponsored it with Senator Sanders. Trump is a pompous blowhard who has no experience with the military, veterans, or politics in general.  




 Not by voting for conservative representatives and senators you don't. The last round of VA funding legislation that was designed to seriously address the issues within the VA and the treatment of our veterans was presented by the left, obstructed by the right, and ultimately gutted down to less than a tenth of its original amount before they would pass it.  




 Because people are stupid.  




 Source?  




 Source?  




 Yeah, that guy was a real piece of work. Representative Duckworth lost both of her legs in the service of her country and that guy had the nerve to insult her record for the sake of political expediency.  




 Next year? The guy's gone bankrupt multiple times.  




 No one with any sense has ever claimed that the US is a true democracy, so why are you arguing against that strawman?  




 Refusing to vote is essentially the same thing as voting for the GOP and corporate interests.  




 Found the Trump supporter.  




 Mathematically, as income goes down a fixed tax like a sales tax will increase as a percentage of ones income. Your ideas suck because 1) sales tax is a discretionary tax. Since rent, car payments, food and I some cases clothing are not subject to sales tax, what IS subject is the discretionary items. If we give low income earners a break on the sales tax on the big flat screen, maybe we are just paying for them to go from the 40 to the 50 incher. That should not be my responsibility.  If you want to have an honest discussion about who should pay for our governments services, I'm certain that it's not the governments role to supersize tvs.

Again, my state charges sales tax on food. People who buy cars pay sales taxes on them. Not everything in a person's home is discretionary. People need refrigerators, laundry machines, ovens, and other appliances to live and those things are taxed. You repeatedly bringing up televisions amounts to basic hateful demagoguery. You might as well be Reagan with his racist caricature of the Cadillac driving "Welfare Queen". You continue to ignore the taxes that the poor pay on food, clothing, appliances, services, utilities, and everything else that costs money. 

The idea also that the all of the non taxpayers are retirees and handicapped people is farcical since it's fully 50% of working age people. The demographics aren't even close to being in your favor. Last your ideas suck because every outside source you cited supported my viewpoint - the nominal tax rates, the bogus nytimes stat and the last citing that confirmed half pay nothing.

Those 50% that you're talking about don't even earn enough to feed themselves and their families. I've repeated this in every reply since you first mentioned them. This thread is a discussion about allowing them to earn an income that sustains life, and here you are complaining and alluding to them being lazy moochers. What good would it be to tax people who aren't able to cover their basic food and shelter requirements? Are they going to be more productive workers and* students when they're homeless and starving? How would that serve society? 


 




 He'll just have to make a bigger ass of himself, if that's even possible.  




 There's so much that's wrong with your statement that I don't even know where to start. 

First Senator McCain wasn't a soldier. He was a Navy sailor and a pilot. His capture wasn't the result of incompetence, but of valor and commitment to his mission. It's always a good idea to do a little research about the topic at hand to avoid making ridiculous claims that result in you looking like an obtuse blowhard.  




 I am a liberal Navy veteran. McCain's service record is a matter of national history. His aircraft was the one that accidentally ignited the USS Forrestal. He escaped death many many times.  




 But all Trump supporters, Republican or otherwise, are idiots.  




 Both are equally worthless reactions. I imagine that this and any other news source would be fine with either reaction. Fuck any news source that publishes big photos of the aggressor and doesn't focus on the victims.  




 When a low income earner buys anything the sales tax affects them. Considering that a family earning the American median income would likely spend most or all of their income on basic living expenses and most of those expenditures would be taxed, it's disingenuous to have a discussion about marginal taxation without discussing these things. Ignoring these things doesn't make them go away. 

"Your ideas suck." You can't objectively attack my ideas so you have to resort to base insults. I think I've adequately proved my point. Have a nice weekend.  




 You're not wrong, but that doesn't mean that amount of distance doesn't present a significant problem for tens of millions of low income Americans everyday.  




 I don't care what you do or think. I was simply pointing out the flaw in the logic of* your assertion that gun ownership is the root cause of police violence in the US.  




 I'm not defending the police, i'm being realistic and explaining reasoning behind their actions. Just because they are wrong doesn't mean there is no reason behind their fear.

No, there's not. If they obeyed the law (the constitution), they would have little to fear as they would not often find themselves in terrible situations where they are and must be the oppressors. 

 Canada also has guns, but only 1/3 ownership, and comparably lower shootings by police and otherwise. Things aren't perfect in Canada either though.

And just what do you think the rate of gun ownership is in the US? Because the [data shows] (http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/15/the-demographics-and-politics-of-gun-owning-households/) that it's roughly ~~the same as that of Canada~~ a third. 

If only police would police eachother more often.

This isn't just an issue of the police policing each other. This is about the criminal justice system ignoring the very clear text of the constitution and the simple and basic rights that it provides for the American people. 

 




 That's because most decent people believe in at least the concept of justice and wouldn't be comfortable with the possibility of executing innocent people. The question is, why would you be comfortable with the possibility of executing innocents?  




 Something like 90%.  




 It is when you live in an area which they've been known to operate in the past. I live in a town of less than 40,000 people and we have had a resident serial killer and there have been plenty of other murderers and predators that have popped up from time to time.  




 We've always had guns in this country. We're not alone in gun ownership. Canada allows gun ownership. 

Americans possessing guns is not an excuse for the police to act like belligerent brutes. A majority of their crimes would simply disappear if they were required to honor the inalienable rights enumerated in the constitution.  




 You're having a difficult time following linear thought aren't you? That 10% to 15% can be added to as much as 12% for sales taxes depending upon the locality of the tax filer. 

I just explained that group that supposedly pays nothing in [federal income taxes] (http://money.howstuffworks.com/only-53-percent-pay-income-tax.htm). They're the retired, the disabled, and those who are earning well below the poverty level. Instead of complaining about these people, perhaps we should be figuring out how we can help them to escape the crippling paralysis of poverty.  




 How can that be true when half pay zero percent of their income in federal income taxes. 

What? The median American household income is $50,000. Their effective tax rate is between 10% and 15%, not zero. The people you're talking about* paying nothing are retirees, the disabled, and severely impoverished families earning less than basic sustenance levels. If you take issue with not taxing them then that's for a different discussion and it would be about basic decency and morality, not the tax code. 


 




 That's ridiculous.  




 We're not talking about retirees or the disabled. We're talking about working American families. They're paying as much or more as a peroof their annual income than the wealthy. 

Some states exclude food or all? My state doesn't. What state excludes clothing from sales taxes? 
 




 Yeah, and as you can see from his other comment that is what he's arguing. He must not have read anything else about Grning who has admitted to having knowledge of the worst operations of the camp.  




 Sales tax doesn't just affect purchases like electronics. You're ignoring that a family earning the American median household income is likely spending most or all of their income on basic living expenses. Much of which will be affected by sales taxes. Considering that, a family earning at that level is paying around 21%

What are you talking about? Capital gains taxes are even lower than payroll taxes. For instance the Romneys paid 14.1% of their $13.7 million income into taxes last year. Add the sales tax and they might have broken 15%.  




 Yeah, that's rich. Those poor occupying soldiers. They were just there to subjugate a people. It was unfair to target them because of their organization's well established evil agenda.  




 Of course it is. Who's arguing against that point?  




 Here's another gem:

It's not about forgetting anything. It's taking into account that he ISN'T responsible, and that he allegedly had no knowledge of what was happening behind the scenes just as many in the Wehrmacht didn't. They were forced to defend their homeland, he was trying to do it in the most harmless way possible to prevent his own execution of treason. That's what you don't get. You have one mindset that he has absolutely no compassion for the camp's victims and actions. He's a frail old man going to prison. Learn to forgive and forget. Vengeance is a dirty move. 



I knew that shit was coming. What a dipshit. 

 




 It's not about forgetting anything.  It's taking into account that he ISN'T responsible, and that he allegedly had no knowledge of what was happening behind the scenes just as many in the Wehrmacht didn't.  

Read his wiki article. He knew damn well what was happening and has admitted it. He personally observed the operations of the gas chambers and the burn pits. 

The Wermacht were not just innocent soldiers. They were complicit in countless atrocities including rounding up "undesirables" for the camps, razing villages and raping and murdering civilians, and destroying German infrastructure in order to prevent the* allies from being able to utilize it. All of which have been well documented. Your's is a revisionist, apologist's history. 

He's a frail old man going to prison.  Learn to forgive and forget.  Vengeance is a dirty move. 

I stand by my previous statements addressing this misrepresentation of the facts. 

 




 Are you serious? You must not be American. Your's isn't even an unpopular perspective here. It's virtually nonexistent. Then you're ignoring the fact that gun ownership is an inalienable right under protection of the 2nd amendment.  




 Were the residents adequately compensated? I didn't see anything in the article that explained this.  




 Best way to deal with a meth head is to put a couple bullets in their head!  I think the new legal system should work on votes from the community wether pieces of shit like this get to keep their life. 

Maybe this new system you're talking about should exclude votes from people who lack basic spelling and grammar skills.  




 It is 100% legal to abort a child at any time during the entire 9 months. 

That is unadulterated, Grade-A bovine excrement. 
 




 It's estimated that a large majority of people with substance abuse problems also suffer from mental illness. I think the number in my state, Missouri is around 80%. I'm sure that some of those people developed their mental health issues because of drug use, but it's generally accepted that substance abuse is often a symptom of mental illness or in other words self medicating.  




 This article suggests that a child costs $13,000 a year?  




 Seems to me like everyone having a gun is the problem here.

Or maybe it's that the police should stop violating basic constitutional rights and judges should stop enabling them.  




 Your perspective ignores what wealth is, where it comes from, and its purpose in bettering society.  




 So let's just forget about all of the people his unit killed, right? He's just an old man now and he's been really good since the war so let's just forgot about all of those grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, aunts, and uncles that they brutally tortured and killed? He was a member of the SS his job was to steal the personal possessions of the condemned innocent and catalog them to be included in the Reich's spoils of war. He's personally responsible for these atrocities whether you want to admit it or not. 

Since when did we drop the punishment/retribution aspect of prison sentences? Even the most progressive states view prison sentences as punishment. Sure rehabilitation is important, but that doesn't mean that people who commit atrocities should be able to avoid the consequences of their actions if they can demonstrate that they've been rehabilitated. He may die in prison. He may not. It's only a four year sentence. Will he even serve the whole thing? Who knows? But if he does die in prison it will be in better conditions and under better treatment than his organization ever afforded anyone. I've no sympathy for him now or ever. He's lived a long full life which is something that millions of people were never able to do because of him and people like him. Good riddance.  




 Do I think you should have a trust fund to have kids? No. **But you should be able to afford to send them to school with lunch and provide them with clothes and a safe and healthy environment**

And just how much money should that cost? How much of parents' time should have to go into earning this income? 

You're putting words into more mouth by trying to tell me what I support. I support families and their right to be together. I'm for supporting families and the children they have rather than drawing imaginary lines and standing on a stump telling everyone else how their families should live. I support finding solutions to our problems as a society, apparently you support hate and prejudice. 

Edit:typo. 
 




 Exactly. These guys should really open a book or five before opening their mouths.  




 Except it does. How about punishing him for his involvement in some of the worst crimes against humanity in recorded history? Maybe you weren't affected by his actions, but millions were. Think about it. Your best argument is that he shouldn't be punished because he got away with it for so long.  




 He was a member of the SS, attached to the camp, and intimately involved in its operations. His duty was to collect and catalog the possessions of the condemned like some hellish ghoul. This man and his actions are indefensible.  




 That analogy would make sense if the police department's only purpose was to work people to death and/or gas them, and the clerk was responsible for stealing and cataloging all of their things. 




 Unfortunately, it seems that today you cannot be a public official without first being a millionaire.  




 It can mean that they're hateful racists.  




 I know. He was a member of the SS who was attached to the camp. What more does one need?  




 Exactly. He was in the fucking camps. His job was to collect the possessions of the condemned like some evil ghoul from hell. This is worse than a Wehraboo. These guys are arguing that one could be attached to the camps and intimately involved with their operations and still be considered "innocent".  




 Yeah, the first sentence is the link.  




 Okay, thanks for the source. It doesn't prove your point, but thanks anyway. 

In 1970 the top marginal tax rate was 70% not the 90% of the fifties. Your link says that the effective tax rate was 33% on couples earning $12,000 or more. Where do you think that puts the super wealthy? 

Furthermore the top average effective tax rate today is not 33% like the article suggests. [It's more like 21%] (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/18/us/effective-income-tax-rates.html?_r=0) and when you consider sales taxes our current system is regressive with median income families paying at least the paying at least that much or more. 

Yes loop holes allowed and still allow the wealthy to weasel out of their tax obligation, but undoubtedly they paid more before Reagan began thisrace to the bottom with our marginal tax system.  




 This one's pretty fucked up too. 

This is idiotic charging a book keeper for the said crimes. That would be like charging a clerk at a police department for police brutality when another officer committed the offense. 

Edit: Here are the full comments. https://np.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/3dd8dw/auschwitz_bookkeeper_oskar_groening_sentenced_to/ 




 And how would you define that? Where do you draw the line and how?  




 That's just what Darth Vader would look like if he were on Squidbillies.  




 Chesticles.  




 I think the number of people who died at the hands of his unit is pretty morbid. Can you imagine this guy going through all of the personal belongings of the people who were to be worked to death and/or gassed? How far did it go? Was he responsible for counting gold teeth and such? 

Edit: grammar. Removed an extra "the".  









 What do you mean?  




 I fun looking at your pics of dead kids.  




 I like this one better than the first.  




 Go thump your bible somewhere else.  




 [Are you sure about that?] (http://taxfoundation.org/article/us-federal-individual-income-tax-rates-history-1913-2013-nominal-and-inflation-adjusted-brackets) It's worth noting that the effective tax rate would be the same during those years with a high top marginal rate because employers would not pay much into the top margin as it was a waste of money. Why pay someone more when it's just going to go to the government? 

Edit: I love how I provided a legitimate source and you simply downvote me. You made unsubstantiated claims and could not resist the urge to use some shitty slang to describe the people you disagree with.  




 "Sun comes up, sun goes down. Tides goes out, tide comes in. There's never a miscommunication. You can't explain that!"  




 what sin is is just religious guidelines as law, but if you already knew about law youd know people 3000 thousand years ago had laws too


I know damn well about the history of cannon law. Religion is not the basis of US law. Sin encompasses stupid shit that cannot be considered crime like masterbation, apostasy, blasphemy, idolatry, vanity, and so on and so forth.  




 So are you talking about the [50 million Americans living beneath the poverty line] (http://www.npc.umich.edu/poverty/), the [46% that have less than $800 in savings] (http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/24/pf/emergency-savings/), or would you prefer people to be in the top 75% in order to have kids. I mean, we just want to be clear about who you think should be allowed to reproduce, because this is important. You've made it clear that people cannot love their children unless they make a certain level of income and I would really like to know just where you've drawn this line.  




 It didn't. It's not. But methods of production and their outputs have increased incredibly. If we actually implemented these processes properly our civilization would be entirely sustainable and resilient.  




 We're still extracting all of the metals we need. We're more efficient than ever at extracting and utilizing these materials. More can be done to recycle them, but they're not so scarce* that we're going to run out any time soon. I addressed the rest of those things in my other comment.  




 Fossil fuels production is at a high right now and expected to increase. Arable land isn't diminishing in the US and it's pretty well known that we can do more with less land than any other time in human history. Yes, fresh water is a problem but it is solvable. First and foremost we should be focusing on preserving the fresh water we already have.  




 Which resources are becoming more scarce?  




 What finite resources are decreasing? I mean sure we're using plenty of resources but much of this consumption has led to an increase in the extraction and production of materials. What resources do you think should be more difficult to obtain and therefore more expensive?  




 So only the wealthy should be able to have kids?  




 Because he's a fucking joke. He's always been a ridiculous hack, and now he wants to be a ridiculous hack that holds the highest political office in the country. He doesn't deserve to be taken seriously by any legitimate news source. He needs to be called out and ridiculed.  




 So what you're saying is if all doctors started doing this unpleasant part of their jobs, there wouldn't be this problem.  




 Did I? How so? Please explain to me how "sin" is more objective than either of those. Explain how sin is of any consequence to those outside of your belief system. 

Edit: I want to point out that you opened yourself to that simple honesty by stating that sin was real. You could have just disagreed with what you read and moved along. You didn't have to make an unsupported and unprovable assertion.  




 You're right he resisted by putting his hands up and saying no. Those officers had no choice but to choke him. /s 




 Yeah, I wonder about that part.  




 No murder is a crime. Sin is an imaginary concept. Much like a person's aura, ESP, any other such superstitious nonsense.  




 Sin is an imaginary disease invented to sell you an imaginary cure.  









 Disgusting.  




 You're being too gentle. I would have called him a vile, murderous psychopath who most certainly should have been executed after the war with the rest of his traitorous, slave-driving co-conspirators.  




 This is why we need to restore the top marginal tax rates to their pre-Reagan levels. In that tax system ridiculous executive salaries and bonuses were prohibitively expensive because after a certain point the company would would have to pay a dollar to every $.30 that the executive received. Under that system the shareholders wouldn't stand for these crazy benefits that executives have grown to expect.  




 From the job creators of course. Don't you know that the wealthy ruling class is just waiting around with all of that capital for all of those people to go to HVAC school. Then they'll share some of the economic gains the country has made in the last five years.  




 Of course they're lazy. What do you call working 60 - 80 hours a week just to pay your immediate living expenses while slipping deeper and deeper into debt?  




 I completely agree, but who are we to argue with those who feel it's necessary to maintain a population of people who are* even less than second class citizens. "They broke a law (who cares if they were fleeing crippling poverty, exploitation, and persecution) they should be thankful to shine our shoes in constant fear that they'll be rounded up into camps and deported back to the chaos from which they escaped".  




 Thanks for clarifying that for us. I'll get that data disseminated to the masses. 

**Attention! Attention!**

**You lazy fucks can do "better". Do it now. That is all.** 




 You're right! I've been telling these people who work for a living that they should be ashamed of themselves and generally depressed so that they'll just give up and off themselves. It's not enough that they have to do the work that the rest of us refuse to do, they need to suffer as people and in their interpersonal relationships too. Human dignity is a luxury and if you can't figure out how to benefit from the enormous return your employer gets from your labor then you don't deserve to enjoy the status of "human being". 




 You're absolutely right. It wouldn't fix everything so we shouldn't do it. It's kind of like how having clean drinking water didn't cure all diseases so it was just a waste of time.  




 Absolutely. Also, it's important to remember that employers would pay their employees **much more** if it wasn't for the government making them pay the minimum wage. The government is artificially lowering wages. That's what **minimum wage** means.  




 Yeah, she could have done better. Maybe she'll try a little harder the next time such a rare specimen is in her court room. Personally, I would have went with something that used the phrase "like a boy".  




 He's figured out how to solve the national problem of poverty! Just don't be poor assholes! If you were wealthy you wouldn't be poor. Figure it out already.

I'm pretty sure that what he's doing constitutes collusion and coordination.  




 The reason I cited ~~APA~~ MLA guidelines is that they are generally accepted by universities and colleges. My English professors made us all buy the APA book and follow the rules that are defined within.

 There are nurse's, truck drivers', and contractor's unions and they have to carry insurance.  




 How about the revelation that Perry is on the [corporate board of the biggest donor to his superpac?] (http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/07/rick-perry-kelcy-warren-super-pac-energy-transfer-partners) I can't think of a clearer case of coordination or collusion.  




 Make them pay for it. Make officers carry professional liability insurance.  




 A violent homophobic police officer in the NYPD? That can't be right. /s 




 Oh yeah, it's perfectly acceptable that the officer slammed a small teenaged girls face into the tile floor while she was handcuffed because she kicked him in the chin. We can't have that officer's ego getting bruised. Who knows what kind of awful things she said to him? Teenage girls are mean. That poor brute.  




 $2 million worth of legal defense doesn't make it sound like they have a weak case to me.  




 Were you expecting electromechanical mechanisms under your skin?  









 I'm for more and more radical reforms, but I don't see that happening any time in the near future. 

What information are you talking about? Insurers already rely solely on the information they* receive from PDs to make decisions about drivers. Police are notoriously bad about properly filing accident reports and whatnot. This would put the police and IA in a position of criminal liability if they fail to properly report incidences, and the insurance companies in a position to press criminal charges against dishonest and unprofessional officers. These days you're not a person unless you're a corporation. Let them answer to their insurers. The communities certainly aren't getting an adequate response to their concerns. 

Insurers would have an obvious interest in protecting their investments from unprofessional and reckless officers. Once an insurance company has assessed the risk involved with insuring each individual officer, I don't see why premiums would have to be any higher than they are for nurses or truck drivers. Officers with bad records would have high premiums or would simply be denied coverage. Problem solved. In assessing the risks of insuring officers in the field the companies would inadvertently be assessing their risks to our communities and weeding out those who were unacceptable.  




 *indicted  




 An Atlanta Journal-Constitution/Channel 2 Action News investigation of the case found that:

- Glynn County police officers interfered with the GBIs investigation from the start, seeking to protect the officers.

- The department tampered with the crime scene and created misleading evidence that was shown to the grand jury.

-  The local district attorney shared the states evidence with the officers nearly two months before the grand jury convened and cut an unusual deal with them just before it met.

 




 No, they get off on violence and hurting people.  




 It assumes no such thing. But it does put the burden of defense and the liability on an insurance company rather than the tax payers and justice system. Let an insurance company investigate and explain the actions of their premium holders. If they can't, let them assume liability and terminate the policy. The officer will then be uninsurable, out of a job, and no longer a threat to the public. It also separates the criminal and civil liabilities of the job. Tax payers need not pay for crimes committed against them.  




 I'm a Democratic socialist and I agree that police should be held to at least the same liability standards as we hold nurses, doctors, contractors, and truck drivers.  




 Recently it came to light that he is personally on the ~~payroll~~ [corporate board of the biggest donor to his superpac?] (http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/07/rick-perry-kelcy-warren-super-pac-energy-transfer-partners). I wonder if anything will come of that?  




 Yep. I remember KMFDM was one of the groups they blamed for Columbine. Totally ridiculous.  














 That's terrible that they blame music for the actions of human beings. Millions of people listen to metal and never harm anyone.
