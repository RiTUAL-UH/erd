 Doran. 




 I think the infected part has to touch her, and it didn't.  




 She didn't touch his infected spot.  




 Because they aren't really that good at throwing things. All they really hit was a giant dragon that you'd have to be visually impaired to miss. Also, at that point the Unsullied would collapse into a ball protecting Danaerys with their shields pointing outward. 




 Doran, Danaerys, Jamie, Brienne?  




 What 180? Desperate times call for desperate measures. He said previously that he would risk everything.  




 Probably patrolling the rest of the city. I'm pretty sure that you don't leave the city unsecured even though there's a gladiator tournament.  




 Give it to Jamie or Doran. 




 She's going to pull an O-Ren Ishii. 




 We didn't see any expert spear throwing. You have to be utterly awful to miss a giant dragon, and that's all they really hit. These guys are fanatics, not trained soldiers. They have no military training and they got scared once their plot was found out by Jorah. 




 These aren't trained soldiers. They are some kind of religious/anti-Danaerys fanatics with no military training. They are still scared of the Unsullied, Naharris and Mormont.  




 She wasn't touching the infected part. And even if that doesn't matter she has super dragon fire powers.  









 Whitecaps = Wildlings?

 Who is preaching about a dragon queen...Wait, I have a theory.  [Lord of Light theory](#g "Based on the preaching of the priestess in Volantis, I think the dragon queen is an integral part of their faith, and that Melisandre is eventually going to sell out Stannis in favor of Daenerys, either by the end of this season or after Stannis possibly becomes King.")  




 Is that you, Stannis? 




 I don't think he's ever even seen a wight and might doubt their existence. 




 We already are. Public viewing parties are huge when the World Cup rolls around. Plenty of MLS teams routinely sell out their matches, with Seattle averaging 38,000 fans per game. International friendlies always draw tons and tons of fans. 

The sport hasn't reached mainstream status, but it grows every year. And as you saw at the World Cup, the national team does well, too.  














 Nah, he was the quiet and nervous kind of creepy, and really was just a kid scared of being bullied once you got to know him.  




 Both.

 




 They did this every World Cup, FWIW. It was usually him and Mike Tirico alternating. I have no idea what Fox will do in 2018.

 Messed up of the Qataris considering one of Prophet Muhammad's famous quotes is "An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor a non-Arab over an Arab, except in piety and good actions."  




 The whole notion of Muslims instituting Islamic law is fear-mongering. Some states have tried to laughably ban it despite US law already prohibits any law from superceding US law. Sadly, all this does it make it harder to do small things like enforce a prenuptial agreement made overseas.   




 With Carmello candy bar as a sponsor.  














 Exactly. If she's just around other women or her blood relatives, then she doesn't wear the hijab.  




 It's actually three substitutions for the entire game, not the half, and that's true worldwide, in every top tier league in every country. 

It's only in college and youth soccer in the United States that the substitution rules are different (some subs can come back in the game, there's more than three, etc.). 

Regarding strategy in subs, yes, they are used for that, and they are also used to sub out tired players. It's up to the coach of each team. Sometimes a coach feels the need to make tactical adjustments with different players, and sometimes a player gets hurt or gets tired.  




  the mod who was leading that charge MIA

It must get pretty spirited in those debates.  




 If she's sincerely wearing the hijab, then she's a practicing Muslim, and thus not having sex outside of marriage. So unless she's married, which would be quite a feat for a high school student, she's almost assuredly not having sex. 

 




  She's probably a super freak for some lucky fella.

If she's sincerely wearing the hijab, then she's a practicing Muslim, and thus not having sex outside of marriage. So unless she's married, which would be quite a feat for a high school student, she's almost assuredly not having sex.  




 I'm pretty sure that Muslims were persecuted and unfairly expelled as as well. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Moriscos 




 If a dog sniffs you, or their saliva touches you, you become ritually unclean and can't pray unless you wash with something other than water (old traditions say sand, soap is used now), and that basically means a shower. I don't fear a dog that isn't attacking me, but I pray five times a day and I can't go run and shower and/or change clothing.

As such, Muslims are discouraged from keeping dogs unless we have a real purpose, like for hunting, using one as a guard dog or herding sheep on a farm, for example. This has led to Muslims seeming skittish about dogs, and since we don't keep them as pets, those of us who never spent much time around them (i.e. people who grew up in Muslim countries) may have some misconceptions about dogs. 

Really, though, most of us keep our distance because we're thinking about the next prayer and don't want to deal with showering and changing clothes. 

I was way off on the state, lol. I'm in PA.  




 It should be noted that the governments (at least as far as we know) aren't the sponsors, but private citizens in those countries. Of course, some of those private citizens have royal connections.  




 What about the Muslims who were kicked out? Oh wait, Spain probably hates them.  




 Hope you sent him/her a PM.  




 Such a shame when money goes to corrupt officials and not to places where it is actually needed to keep the game going.  




 Lol, security nightmare, and talk about human rights abuses.  




 They were scared of all the Ebola affected countries taking part.  




 Leaving Ser Alliser in charge is very smart on Jon's part, in that case. Mist of the anti-wildling people aren't going turn on him.  




 I live closer to the Amish than you do, lol. We probably live in the same state. I consider myself practicing, and no, it is not a sin to talk to you. Many Muslim women who cover wear jeans, actually most of of the young Muslim women I've met in the states wear jeans. 

Women aren't required to have a man escorting them everywhere. In some of the more conservative Muslim countries,  sure, that rule is there and it is misguided, but the lack of education of many there makes it a safety issue for women. 

I've been to Iran, Pakistan, Iraq (mid 1990s), Syria, the West Bank, Egypt, Dubai and Jordan, and I've seen women walking around all the time on their own without a male guardian. My mother and sister got to work every day on their own and both wear the hijab.

We use modern technology,  unlike the Amish, and we tend to wear all types of clothing, unlike them.  




  Evidence to the contrary be damned

Did it ever occur to you that your "evidence" isn't representative of Muslims, and that what you see here is what Muslims are *actually like?* 




 Meanwhile millions of Muslims go through live every day, going to school, going to their jobs, raising their families, living their lives as ordinary citizens, throughout Europe and the United States, not bothering anyone. 

Except you though. Because you sat behind your computer screen, read a couple of articles about some out of the blue, rare, abhorrent actions, and decided that those actions defined an entire religion made up of a billion plus people. 

I can see some radical, sitting behind a computer in a far off Muslim country, hearing about a terrorist attack in response to a U.S./coalition bombing and thinking, "You can do your Do-As-We-Say shit in the U.S. or Europe, but here we will not tolerate it. We will not have non-Muslims control our behavior through violent acts."

You aren't quite that different from that radical. He doesn't have the benefit of an education, so he might do something stupid. Thankfully, all you'll ever do is post stupid things on the internet and continue thinking stupid thoughts.  




 That looked like a legit HBO promo. Well done. 




 I recall her being very uneasy during the marriage. For example, she was very relieved when Jorah showed up with his gift. 

**EDIT:** I was referring to Daenerys's wedding to Khal Drogo, not her (upcoming?) wedding to Hizdahr.  




 Aww yeah, BJIV is in! 




 We're not the Amish, lol.  




 Dude, this is pretty old. I've seen quite a few.

 I get the feeling that if he was supporting the Israeli government, you wouldn't be saying that.  




 It's amazing what happens when punitive actions are threatened. This is why the BDS movement shouldn't be discounted.

 If you scroll down: 

 According to the source, Israel offered a four-point proposal that addressed most of the Palestinians grievances.

 1. Palestinian players and coaches will receive special documents to facilitate their travel from Gaza to the West Bank and abroad.

 2. Israel will ease restrictions and promote soccer-related projects in the West Bank, including the construction of a stadium and other facilities.

 3. Israel would cover the costs of tax and customs for sports equipment imported by the Palestinians to the West Bank via Israel  predominantly via the Ashdod seaport.

 4. A joint committee comprised of representatives from Israel, the Palestinian Authority and FIFA would be formed and would convene monthly to address day-to-day issues and any problems that arise. 



















  It's important also to note that Jordan is a constitutional monarchy, not an absolute monarchy like the Gulf states,

Eh, this is debatable. They profess to be a constitutional monarchy, but the Hashemite family pretty much calls the shots. They have a secret police and political dissenters aren't always free to express their opinions. They are somewhat better than the Gulf states, but aren't a constitutional monarchy like England or Spain.  









 York is cheap and has a few bars, plus it is relatively cheap to live there. It's close to Gettysburg, Harrisburg, Baltimore, and Lancaster (sort of in the middle of all of them). Lancaster is a really cool city with tons to do that has a lot of shopping, organic stores, great restaurants and young people, and since that would really be far from Gettysburg, York is your best bet.  




 The Caribbean bloc of CONCACAF were the ones implicated in the scandal. The lone Central American personality indicted was Eduardo Li of Costa Rica. It should be noted that CONCACAF provisionally suspended the current President, Caribbean Jeffery Webb*, in favor of a Honduran official. 

*EDIT: Just scrolled up and saw the name in the sidebar picture. Of course, it's Jeffery Webb.

LOL, you think Muslims are unified? ISIS is Muslim, most of the people they are killing are Muslim and the people fighting them are Muslim. They have not succeeded in overthrowing any countries, as the countries they are in are *already Muslim* to begin with.  




 If you're thinking about Pynadath, he's in Real Madrid's system.

  this violence is explicitly part of these religion's dogmatic writings.

Not according to what I was taught, and to the scholars which I follow. Tell me, what is the nature of your expertise with Islam? Do you follow the religion, or have a theological background?  









 Thanks for your views. There are many things wrong in Baltimore and the police department is one of them. 

 




 I don't comment there. And why? I hold no ill will to you or even most police.  




 Funny thing about that: many who invoke religion don't know the first thing about theirs or do and are only using it as an excuse. If they can't use religion, they'll use something else.  




 It's to provide background about Baltimore's situation. 

You seem to be going out of your way to not comment about Detective Crystal or what happened to him. 




 I tend to be optimistic about people. Hopefully, I get at least one genuine comment before this post drops off the front.  




 You took that excerpt out of context. The story isn't even about Freddie Gray, It's about Detective Joe Crystal, an officer like many here (at least I hope so). You took two paragraphs about a subject not related to the main focus of the article. In any case, the quote you pulled says that the state's attorney concluded this fact, not that she was right or wrong in doing so. 

In no way have you addressed the main content of the article: what happened to Detective Crystal after he reported his fellow officers for misconduct.  




 What do you think about the article? Is it unfairly prosecuting? Does the officer in question have a compelling story or does something not add up? A good article is a good article no matter where it comes from.  




 I just posted an open-ended fresh question in a fresh post. I must confess, I've been in this sub before, and this is most abrasive reaction that I've ever gotten.  




 Ok, this is long overdue, so here goes: 

I saw this and was genuinely shocked at what happened to this officer. I want to know what you all think, and what your experience is regarding officers who report other officers for misconduct. I have no idea of how uncommon or common that is in a police department. 




  I guess you can waddle back to BCND and tell everyone how P S disregarded the article because of the source.

Can you honestly tell me how that is helpful to any discussion? What's done is done now. It seems you're having a bad day, and I'm sorry if this article was just the straw that broke the camel's back. What do you think about the article? Is it unfairly prosecuting? Does the officer in question have a compelling story or does something not add up? Please, I mean no offense. 
 




 Please, enlighten me. 

Posters in this thread are judging the story by the domain name, and I see few comments on the actual content of the article itself. i didn't post here to provoke or insult police officers. I wanted to see the genuine opinions of police officers on this subject, positive or negative. Is anyone willing to say anything?

  People tend to tell them to fuck off with the bullshit.

Uh, yeah, ever heard of [Serpico?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpico). This isn't new, and that's not an appropriate way to respond to public criticism. You're not doing yourself or your fellow officers any favors. 
  




 I think what I like about police most is their friendly relationship with the community.  









 What's the difference between ISIS and these kinds of people? They both look at texts literally without studying their context or deeper meaning. 




 I genuinely wanted to see what police thought of this story by posting it here. Instead, these comments are about people bitching over Buzzfeed.  




 I'm guessing you saw that post in /r/worldnews. Thank you for having an appropriate response and not resorting to "OMG Islam is evil just like all religions" like many on Reddit are prone to do.
