 Hey what's up man I'm sorry to hear you've OD'd so many times. For what it's worth, to me it still seems like you have some relative stability in your life like a job and a place to stay. I hope things look up for ya in the future man, cheers 




 A few of my closest friends know I use occasionally and if I'm high they'll usually ask what I'm on and I'll tell them H or oxy. If someone else asks I'll just say I haven't had coffee and I'm tired. I shudder when I try to imagine the fallout that would occur if my parents or any of my extended family found out. But that's the nature of these drugs, you have to be able to keep secrets from certain people. 




 I can't stop the drool from running down my chin. 




 I have it saved :)

edit: Buying seeds is legal and isn't sketchy at all, you can get a couple pounds of seeds (make sure they're unwashed) from Amazon and have them shipped to you. 




 I really enjoyed reading the ending to the series yesterday. I hope there's gonna be more stories on the way! 




 Ahh okay. I've only tried PST once and I used a pound of seeds. I liked the nod but not enough to pursue it I guess. It's a great option if you can't find anything else though. 




 That's pretty peculiar, I've heard that w/ds from PST are some of the worst. What quantity of seeds do you use when you make the tea? 




 That's really sad, I'm sorry for your loss. Terrible circumstances 




 I snorted some adderall, had a few shots of vodka, smoked a blunt and couldn't get it up. Needless to say she was disappointed, but she was also fucked up on vicodin and alcohol so she didn't care too much. We cuddled and watched some Netflix, I took an ativan to fall asleep and that was the night. 




 Ahh nostalgia. Thank you for posting this 




 Ahh okay that makes a lot more sense then. I'd be sleepy as hell on all those antihistamines. 




 Doxylamine is a first generation antihistamine used to potentiate opiates. Not sure why you'd want to take it at the same time as DPH though. 




 Someone mentioned it elsewhere in the thread but apparently biker gangs (?) moved tons of these things from Canada into the northeast US. The pills I got are from the Boston area. Beyond that I couldn't tell you. 




 Snorting them feels pretty great, I'd say try one if you ever come across any. They're cheaper than real oxys too since they're fake. 




 Coke, oxycodone, xanax and hash oil is my favorite combo. I make sure to decrease the dose of each drug when I do combos though. 




 I was told that these were fake 80s by my dealer but that they did contain a moderate amount of some opiate. When i snort half a pill there's not much euphoria but there is a very heavy nod. The nod doesn't last as long as dope. Maybe it's fentanyl but I don't consider myself experienced enough to say with any certainty. 









 The analysis of antinociceptive efficacies produced by co-administration of ascorbic acid and morphine or tramadol for different levels of nociception, revealed that co-administration provided better antinociceptive coverage than the individual drugs. There is neither a simple explanation for the mechanism of interaction between the two drugs, nor for the type of interaction at different levels of the antinociceptive effect.  
  
Very interesting. It's unfortunate that the mechanism behind this interaction isn't well understood yet. Something I'm curious about is how Table 2 lists the dosage ratio of morphine to ascorbic acid as about 1:260 and how this would translate to actual dosage in humans. 




 Really great story. Good to hear you've been clean of such a heavy habit for so long and it's worked out for you. Respect 




 Actually it depends. If the drug you're snorting has better oral bioavailability than intranasal then a drip is actually desirable and may slightly increase absorption, i.e. oxycodone. But with other drugs like ketamine for example, a drip is less desirable because of how bad oral bioavailability is. 




 AH-7921, U-44700, parafluorobutyrfentanyl (relatively new), butyrfentanyl, and methylfentanyl to name a few. 




 Good looks on the peace tea, I don't hear people mention it very often. By far my favorite type of iced tea. I like the peach flavor the most but snoberry and razzberry are great too. 




 CWEs all day bruh 




 Hi :)  
  
Currently pretty high on this combo and I love it. I find that the oxy takes the edge off some of the uncomfortable twitchiness from coke.  
  
But I also have a question. I'm aware that cocaine is cardiotoxic, but would adding an opiate such as oxycodone to the mix put more "strain" on the heart, making the combination even worse for your heart?  
  
I'd also like to hear what people think about mixing coke with other opiates. Are there any that you prefer mixing coke with? Thank you all, I lurk a lot and don't post too often but I really like this community. 




 I love the chewy Spree 




 Ain't no tellin what the future will hold. 




 Hi OP 




 1. I had tried quite a few drugs (but not nearly as many as some people on here) before trying opiates. One day I was finally able to get my hands on some 5/325 vicodins. Took 2, smoked some weed and had a great time.  
  
2. The high has a physical aspect to it that just isn't there with weed. No matter how high you get on weed you won't experience the same extent of analgesia you get from opiates. Or the "not giving a fuck" type feeling because of how absolutely amazing you feel from the euphoria.  
  
3. I only use occasionally so that my tolerance stays low and so I can avoid addiction.  
  
4. I would say they've had a negative effect on my social life. I've had to hide my use from most of my friends. It really depends on the person but the guilt from hiding it from certain people can get to you after a while. As for the positive aspect, getting high on opiates is better than every other drug I've tried.  
  
5. I've never binged on opiates since I try very hard to space out my usage.  
  
6. Know that physical withdrawals are the least of your worries compared to the social stigma, monetary cost, tolerance, psychological addiction and even death if you shoot up.
