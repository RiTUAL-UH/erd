 o_o; I  don't even know how to respond to that. 




 Keep on calling/writing and on escalating the situation until you reach someone who has the power to wave the fee.

If that doesn't work, file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Believe me, Bell will budge. 




 GRlggmgrmggmreogeogm.

That's it, I'm sending Rodriguez after you. Watch out next time you put your socks on. One of them will have TEETH. 




 And don't forget some Quebec shit too.

You spelled "Ontarian" wrong! 




 Stories plagiarized from /r/NoSleep coming in 321... 




 Seems pretty legit. 




 He's busy entertaining my new house guest. He'll be back soon, don't worry.

It's not his fault you were sleeping last night when he came to visit you. He said you smell nice when you sleep. 




 That might be why. 




 That photo looks bizarrely familiar. 




 She doesn't look real at all! Cute, though. 




 Serious question: is that a real dog? 




 I refuse to answer that question, for fear that it will incriminate me. 




 Cool! :) 




 Why do I feel like it's a *lot* creepier than a pile of corpses? 




 A kindred spirit!

I'm Ontarian, but I've lived all over the place --- including Nova Scotia. My parents were in the army.

You wouldn't happen to be from Moncton, would you? :O My sister moved there a few years ago for work, and only recently made the move to Halifax. 




 You're **monsters**, all of you. 




 Bllurgghblreurebruberghnggnnnnnhnnn! 




 NO. NO NO NO NO NO NO. NO.

You son of a gun!

I'M AN **ONTARIAN**, Y'ALL!!! 




 Would you say you are *verbotening* the misuse of it? ;D 




 Would you say you *verboten* the misuse of it? :D 




 AAAAAAH!!!


AHHHHH!!!!!!!


**AAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!!** 




 It's always good to know a curse word or two in every language, though I find throwing my fists in the air, stomping my feet, and screaming "RAWWRR!!" to be pretty universal. 




 In my heart, you *are* Richard Gere. 




 Just do a combination of all the things you imagine when you think of **Canada**, and that's me. 




 Pretty! :O 




 I'm now giggling at the thought of a Roman general doing a headcount, and becoming frazzled after reaching the 667th soldier.

P.S. You've got your perspectives mixed up:

* First person: **I** walked along the beach, eating your soul.

* Third person: **He** walked along the beach, eating your soul.

* Fifth person: **The collective** walked along the beach, some eating your soul, others licking dead jellyfish to try and identify the correct sub-species. 




 Good point, but I have a soft spot for animals. : ( 




  ;---;  




 Result may not be as advertised. 




 I hope not. : ( 




 Agreed. 




 I'll ask Grandma next time I visit her.

Judging purely on the fact that these beaches have been around for a good 200-300 years without serious hauntings (that I know of), my guess is that it's probably safe  unless you do something stupid like take sand home as a souvenir. 




 *Gulp* 




 Unfortunately, yes and yes. 




 I wasn't loved enough as a child? 




 Orange juice without pulp and without alcohol, because I don't drink.

What I actually do is listen to the NSP theme song. That gets me goin'. 




 It was a canine. The root actually makes it pretty long. Admittedly, I'm a city-dweller, unlike my grandma. Figured it was the tooth of a *small* wild animal. 




 Have you ever been to a white sand beach that seemed a little out of place? Rarely do you see them in the northern part of the United States or in Canada, but there are a *few* exceptions. White sand beaches are usually found in tropical areas, and theres a good reason why: theyre actually created by a very unique fish, called [Parrotfish]( http://i.imgur.com/rzlOxfi.jpg). Few people realize that those paradise-like beaches are the excrements of a creature that eats rocks and coral reefs. Over millions of years, the parrotfishs  gastric rejects  wash up on shore to form the scenes you see in travel magazines. Parrotfish, however, only live in warm saltwater and stick to the southern hemisphere. So, how is it that you can find white sand beaches along certain freshwater lakes and coasts in the north? Well, that white sand isn't *supposed* to be there. If you take a handful of it, youll notice that theres something different about it. You wont know why, but it wont feel *quite* like regular sand. I found out the truth while visiting my grandma.

Grandma Taborri, who was one of the village elders on the reserve, looked as ancient as the trees in the forest. She was the serious type, never cracking a joke or straying from her tight morals. The generational gap between us couldn't possibly have been wider, which caused a bit of friction between us. Though I had nothing but respect for her, I was going a little stir-crazy being cooped up alone in the cabin with her, so I decided to go to the lake for a relaxing swim. I was delighted to see a white sand beach waiting for me in the sunlight. Large, soft boulders were scattered around, as though forming a trail to the water.

As I was walking along the shore, I felt a rock slip between my foot and sandal. Thankfully, I was able to avoid stepping on it. After pulling my sandal off, I reached inside to retrieve the rock in question. To my surprise, it wasn't a rock at all: it was a sharp tooth. *Huh, wonder what animal it comes from*, I remember thinking. A mountain lion? A wolf? A bear, perhaps? I pocketed the peculiar item so I could make a necklace out of it later.

When I returned to the village, I gleefully showed my find to Grandma Taborri, hoping shed be able to identify the animal it came from. The expression on her face suddenly soured, increasing the depth of the creases on her face.

Where did you get this? she asked me in a raspy voice.

I pointed outside, By the lake, I answered.

She grabbed my arm firmly, and pulled me towards a wooden bench by the fireplace. I took a seat next to her, wondering what had gotten her in such a state.

Do you know how white sandy beaches are made? she asked me.

Yeah, actually, theres this freaky fish with teeth that- I began, but she cut me off using nothing but a stern look.

No, child. That is not how they were created here, she replied, pressing her lips together, I will tell you the story, but only if you promise to sit still and listen to the end.

I nodded, fairly certain she was about to tell me a long-winded tale about Nuktuk, the Serpent god who swam in the sky and broke apart into stardust to turn soil into white sand, or some sort of ridiculous mythological tale of the sort. She had a way of drawing out the ancient stories, and I confess, I sometimes found my thoughts wandering midway through. Still, the seriousness in her tone was enough to force my attention on her. I was not expecting what she was about to tell me, nor the conviction with which she told the story. I knew that *she* believed wholeheartedly what she was saying, which made the tale ring eerily true.

When the white man came, he held in one hand a gift, and carried the shadow of death in the other. His bloodlust and greed knew no bounds, she said.

I was a little taken aback, having not expected a history lesson. I knew how it went: colonials invaded, killed a bunch of Native Americans with infected blankets, and then kept being jerks for a long time. They wanted the land and didn't mind killing what they considered to be savages to get it. Still, I listened patiently as she explained, in dreadfully boring detail, everything I had learned during Thanksgiving week in grade school, though her alleged death toll rang much higher than the history books claimed. By the time American History 101 was over, I had completely forgotten about the original topic, but then, she continued.

It wasn't long before the white man learned of the beautiful ivory shores on the lower-continent. His settlements already built, he could do nothing but lament the rocky cliffs and brown beaches outside his window. He yearned for the bleached sand, of which he heard so many rumors, she continued, pausing to adjust her collar.

Go on? I urged, finding myself strangely intrigued.

She seemed distressed, but continued nonetheless, They turned to the slain bodies of our brothers and sisters. For weeks and months, their bones and teeth were carefully ground into tiny speckles, which were then spread along the shoreline, she murmured.

My heart stopped. Was she saying what I thought she was saying?

Pay heed to what I have to say, child. When you walk upon a white sandy beach, where white sand should not exist, you walk upon your ancestors. That is why you will find a path of boulders along the shore, for we do not wish to step on the souls of the departed.

I looked at the tooth in my trembling hand, I'm  going to go put this back where it belongs, I murmured.

She nodded peacefully, That would be wise, she answered dully, letting the sorrow escape her body through a single teardrop.

Twilight had fallen by the time I returned to the lake, covering it in a beautiful orange sheen. I leapt from boulder to boulder until I reached the waters edge. There, I placed the tooth right where it belonged. As I turned my gaze towards the water, I saw the faded outlines of my ancestors, and offered a simple prayer in the hopes that their souls would one day find peace.

So, dear reader, if you ever find yourself walking along one of those white sandy beaches that shouldn't exist, I implore you to be careful. Youre standing not on microscopic rocks, but on a burial ground. 




 I feel as though I just lost a few braincells. o_o 




 Do you promise to behave this time? :/ I'm tired of having to clean up your bodily juices. 




 This is some kind of demon riddle, right? I'm not very good at riddles. No immortality for me. :( 




 Love it! 




 Try not to think about it. Otherwise, *they'll know*.

 Oh, the things they do with their blow holes... 




 Unfortunately **very** true. 




 Dolphins are notoriously cruel and will sexually abuse other animals, as well as toss baby whales around like a beach ball. Believe me, Dolphins are twisted sons of guns.

 No worries. No one can fault you for asking.

 I had a story where the protagonist slips on some Skittles and hits his head on the coffee table on the way down. The story got narrated and put on Youtube. Someone commented saying:

"Taste the rainbow motherfucker."

That is my all-time favorite comment. I laughed so hard. 




 Gnggnhnn, that voice. That beautiful voiiiice. You can read anything of mine any day, man. 




 That's what ...she...said?

Wait, why am I dissing myself? 




 No. 




 I'm digging so hard, I've hit bedrock. 




 I believe it *used* to be against the rules, but that was changed when they modified them a few months ago. I recommend carefully going through the rules page to confirm, though. 




 Damn, Knotty. I had no idea. I will send positive vibes your way, via carrier pigeons. Please do not shoot the pigeons. 




 Nah, you don't need to use a throwaway. Post it as you are. People'll just refer to you as 'OP' any ways. :) 




 Am I the only one that feels like something's crawling all over me? 




 You can get in touch with Jude by following these steps:

1. Go into a windowless bathroom at 12:00 pm.
2. Place a candle in front of the mirror, but don't light it. No matter what you do, NEVER light the candle.
3. Recite the summoning incantation, which goes a little something like this: *Nah naaa naaa na-nanana na-nanana, heeeeey Jude!*

The candle ought to light up on its own. If you look into the mirror, you'll find Jude standing behind you, hand on your shoulder. Don't look away from the mirror, else Jude will disappear.

(I'm sorry, I don't know who 'Jude' is. I can't actually help. : ) 




 My mum usually reads through my stories for me. She's amazing at picking out mistakes. 




 Shhhhh, those are his *special friends*. 




 Done! 




 I seldom reply to comments because it rarely makes sense for my *character* to reply. If it's a PM; however, I will reply out of character. 




 That voice  that voice is so adorable. 3 Manen approves! I'm not a narrator, so don't know the proper terminology, but you have good flow and enunciate well.

*Cough cough* There's a female protagonist in [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/304yzs/my_grandma_was_eaten_by_a_willow_tree/) and in [this one, too](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2xypxr/beware_of_shooting_stars/). 




 I am *always* terrified to post my stories because I don't know whether they'll be a huge flop, or successful  but I can't say it's because I doubt my work. There are so many factors behind why a story -even a good one- can fail on NoSleep, that I just put my heart into it and hope it gets traction.

That said, I do have a file folder of scrapped ideas and half-written stories. I think that's normal. You can't always spew out pure writing gold.

If I can be so bold as to offer a bit of advice  maybe you should try printing your story out and revising it on-paper? I personally find that my brain works a lot better that way, and I can catch where the story loses its flow with a lot more ease.

Aside from that, all I can tell you is: post. Post as much as you want. What's the worst that can happen? Your story won't gain traction. That's OK, you can try again with the next one. 




 No one of value is going to tell you your story sucks. Like everywhere online, there are always a few jerks who will find something to poke at in the story, but believe me, they aren't fellow writers.

Even if you were to specifically ask one of the writers to critique your story, they're not going to flat-out tell you it's bad. They're going to give you tips on improving it, so please don't be afraid to post. You'll never be able to please everyone, so just hope for indifference, and if you get good reviews, then jump for joy! 




 Goodness me, thank you! : )

I'm still going to try and make it work. Thought of an idea while washing the washroom, but I see now that it doesn't work with the premise, so I'll put that idea aside for another story. Tourists. Right. Tourissssts. I'm so doing it. 




 I'm not sure if that's a compliment, an insult, or a challenge ... but I am taking it as a challenge ... and I ACCEPT the challenge! 




 Ah, yes. New blood is always the tastiest. 




 "One evening in an abandoned farmhouse haunted by an alien creature, an insane widower becomes possessed and buys a tome of eldritch lore at a yard sale."

Holy cow. Aliens, tomes of eldritch lores, insanity, AND supernatural possession? That's a LOT of balls to juggle.

Edit: "One night, a group of tourists find a strange television set using a disturbing pendant, a lost ring, and a strange book."

Hahahhahahaha, because it takes three mystical items to find strange old TV sets. 




 Fun! What a fun question! :)

I rather enjoyed writing [There's nothing in the dark that isn't there in the light](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2piqpq/theres_nothing_in_the_dark_that_isnt_there_in_the/), though the story wasn't exactly popular. I'd say [I thanked the man who murdered my only friend](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2sr06h/i_thanked_the_man_who_murdered_my_only_friend/) is my favorite, though. Mostly because it features one of my RP characters, the crow guy. It was a lot more fun to write. 




 *Cough* [Shameless self-promotion](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2x0z0z/i_used_to_hack_baby_monitors_one_night_i_learned/) *cough cough* 




 You definitely should do it. I'm pretty sure none of the authors would object, as long as you ask them beforehand. 




 Maybe from the [Rockcliffe Flying Club](http://www.rfc.ca/en/)? If memory serves me right, you can pay for an introductory one-time flying lesson where you get to fly one of the planes. (Around 75-100$, I think?)

If they're red, then I believe it might be one of uOttawa's planes. I heard they (inexplicably) have planes. 




 The STO bus passes cover both Ottawa and Hull. Depending on where you live, the commute to Ottawa from Hull can be anywhere between 30 to 60 minutes.

For instance, if you choose to live on Plateau (a good neighbourhood, fair rent and plenty of stores nearby), it'll take you about an hour to get to Algonquin in the morning. You'll have to transfer busses once you reach Ottawa.

In the end, you'll have to decide what's worth more: your money, or your time. Ottawa is expensive, but you'll get to class a lot quicker. A long bus ride can be a pain, but it's also relaxing and you can get some homework done.
