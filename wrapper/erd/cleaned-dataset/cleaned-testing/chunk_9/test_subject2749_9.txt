 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8a1tmq9aJk this is my newest episode in a recently started let's play. Feel free to leave some feedback on what you think and how I could improve my formula. 




 Join me and a friend as we journey back to ancient Greece (before the economy went to s***) and fight off a skeleton army on our way to Sparta. 




 Join the Ethnic Gamers as we meet our first copycat in a match of Mount and Blade Napoleonic wars. Then, stay for the final fight between Derek (the Bearjew as he calls himself) and Mel Gibson. Come for the intrigue, stay for the insensitivity!
