 I dislike games with traitor mechanism or those that require backstabbing. I just can't identify any fun factor. Why do people find lying and deceit to be fun? 
The only game I can stand in this genre is One Night Ultimate Werewolf because it lasts 10 minutes. 




 Whilst I agree with your points, it would be more accurately named as "successful medium-heavy game designs".  




 Before buying the copy, why not try it online at boardgamearena.com to see whether it's really what you are looking for? 




 I've won with the strategy you described, but I've also won before by rushing the knights to gain more early actions, then dominating movement and trading posts. 

The issue I have with the game is a more generalised description of the above: the lack of variability and a deterministic opening two rounds. This means there are standard opening moves for knight strategy, scribes strategy, cog strategy etc. 




 Don't waste the back page of the rule back with credits! Put something useful there - icon references, FAQs, explanation to end game scoring, just generally things that players may need to look up frequently. 




 I've taught 3 games now...and it's really tiring. Another issue is that no matter how many times I tell newbies "it's really important to get cars, don't just focus on training and getting seats", there's always one player that ends up with only 1 car and loses by a margin of 40+ points. 




 **Terra Mystica with expansion** - played Chaos Magicians, came in second and lost to Riverwalkers. If the Aurens were not in play I could have gotten more points off the cult track..

**Agricola** - 5p tournament game in which food was brutally tight. Pulled a close win by playing the Braggart in round 12.

**Goa** - finally tried this. Love the tech tree upgrade aspect but I'm never a big fan of auction games..

**Nations the Dice Game** - Fits the bill for a light civilisation/drafting game that plays under an hour. I expect to be playing a few more games of this. 

**Elysium** - I've played a few 3p games before and didn't realise 4p could be so cruel. Every move is a blocking move! Gives a very different feel compared to a 3p game.

**Kanban** - Great game. I hope to play a game with all experienced players some time. Teaching to newbies is very tiring.

**Small world** - Still not a big fan but I'd still play it from time to time.

**Castles of Mad King Ludwig** - Very tight and enjoyable game. Just don't play with players with AP..

+Various fillers including **For Sale**, **Perudo**, **6 nimmt**, **Criminal Dance**, **Troll** 




 Looking forward to **The Gallerist**, **Nippon**, and the **Castles of Burgundy** spinoffs, although the Gallerist will be on kickstarter anyways.. 




 I've been to the Yellow Submarine in Tokyo and they have a good selection. Links to Yellow Submarine Osaka shop:

 If there's no luck in a coop game, it means that there will always be an optimal solution. Experienced players will recognise and suggest the optimal solution while the inexperienced players sit there executing the plan. This is why cooperative games almost always need luck of some sort, so that your attitude to risk is an input to your strategy.

Relatively speaking, **Robinson Crusoe** and **Hanabi** has less luck involved. **Mysterium** also has minimal luck but it's a different type of coop game. 




 I think if a group have tried a variety of games and decided they don't like social deduction, then it's just a matter of taste. It's the same answer to "how to get my friends to like euro games/war games/broccoli/horror films etc" 




 While I own and enjoy both **Kanban** and **Panamax**, I don't think they would be games that you're looking for based on the games you listed above. With a 4-p game, it **always** go beyond 2 hours. In my opinion they get recommended regularly partly because they came out in 2014 and new games always attract more attention.

For mid-weight economic games, I'd suggesting trying **Power Grid**, **Chicago Express**, **Imperial 2030**, **Concordia**? Perhaps even **Terra Mystica** or **Brass**?

For mid-weight worker placement games, I'd suggest trying **Manhattan Project**, **Tzolkin**. **Dominant Species** also seem to be a good fit for your group as you enjoy cut-throat games. 




 Exactly my thoughts. In **Macao** you get coloured cubes that don't represent anything and you can spend money to buy points, can't get more pasted-on theme than that. 




 I really enjoy 3p games. In 2p, the dummy player introduces extra randomness. In 4-5p, there's a lower need in paying attention to other players' choices. I think 3p presents the best player interaction in terms of phase selection. 




 Asmadi games published the beta pnp version online: [link](http://asmadigames.com/MottainaiPnP.pdf)

I've played Impulse but not Innovation. It's slightly similar to Impulse where everyone contributes a card to the "phase order track" so whichever role you choose it will benefit other players. One difference is that the role card you choose this round will not be activated again next round - instead your previous role would be discarded into the "pool". Similar to GtR, cards from the pool could be hired as clients or taken as materials.

Even with a few cards that allow you to directly steal things, Mottainai had less direct confrontation compared to Impulse. It's also not as obvious who is winning, as players could reveal cards from the hand at the end of game to score extra points. 




 Went to a weekend convention here in the UK so I managed to play 33 games last week, but I'll just post the memorable ones :P

**Elysium** x2 - Very simple yet brain burning drafting + set collection game. Plays within an hour and a lot of player interaction for a Euro. It was a hit at our con. Only complain is that you're never sure what will be available next round (unless you play with a certain deck).

**Roll for the Galaxy** - Full of interesting decisions yet very quick. One of the most played games at the con. The other two are probably Elysium and Quartermaster General.

**Argent: the Consortium** x2 - My fifth play and still enjoying it thoroughly. Everyone was in the run for winning until the final reveal. 

**Panamax** - Played it many times but this is the first time to play with a full table of experienced euro gamers. Lots of table talk. It was INTENSE. Scores ended up 94-94-108-114 which surprised all of us.

**Terra Mystica** x2 - Still my all time favourite. Riverwalkers were fun to play with.

**Aquasphere** - I wish it could be more strategic. Ends up being very tactical and you just have to be at the right place at the right time.

**Captains of Industry** - I love economic games but I'm starting to have mixed feelings about this game. The random time tracker can be annoying at times.

**Mottainai** - It felt like a constipated version of Glory to Rome as the pool was always empty. Just doesn't flow as well, but perhaps we made some rule mistakes.

**Red7** - A pleasant surprise following the disappointment in Mottainai. Very clever and fluid game once everyone understand how to break ties. I should pick up a copy.

**Scoville** x2 - A decent game. Both times I played the final round seemed like an anticlimax though.

**St. Petersburg (2nd ed)** - Clever game, but gives a clear advantage to experienced players who know the distribution of cards by heart.
