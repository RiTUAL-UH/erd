 I've never been self employed though :-S in 2012 I worked in a call centre and in 2013 worked for a soft furnishings company. I never received a final P45 from the call centre (they were a front for a timeshare company so I'm assuming they didn't file the documentation properly) and the soft furnishings company evidently didn't have me on the right tax code; I'm currently paying back that debt.

HMRC have the details for my current employer as I contacted them when I started last year, so I don't need to fill in tax returns now. 

Edit: To clarify I worked for the call centre Jan - July and Aug - Nov 2011 (was paid off both times) and I worked for the soft furnishings company from Feb 2012 - Feb 2013 (company went into liquidation) 




 But I didn't receive notice that I was to file a tax return until 19th March. This is what is confusing me. 




 I've received two penalty notices for tax years 2012 and 2013 and a combined penalty of 200. I filed my tax self assessment on April 1st (which I believed to be the deadline day) 

Was I just a day late? Surely if I'd be receiving a harsher penalty if I'd gone any further over. I'm so confused and I'm sorry I don't have a lot of information but I just want to know if I have messed up or if there are grounds to appeal. 




 I'm seeing a lot of comments urging users to switch to Voat in response to the decisions of Reddit upper management.

Can you give me an ELI5 breakdown of Voat?  




 I'm guessing this is a regional thing as in the UK this is pretty common. You have your guests at the ceremony and "wedding breakfast" (the reception dinner) and once that is over you can have additional guests at the evening reception. A plated meal is not normally provided during the evening party but usually a buffet is. 

If this is not common in your area it could be interpreted as rude and your idea of a later ceremony seems more cost effective if you don't go down the evening reception route. 




 I'm in Scotland. I think I've been a bit ignorant and assumed humanist ceremonies were legal in all the UK. It seems bizarre they aren't.

Sorry if my comment was misleading.
