 Pizza. 

Hot or cold. For breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Thin and crispy or deep dish. From regular pepperoni to stuffed crust supreme. Taco pizza. BBQ chicken and bacon. Veggie. With olives. Even floor pizza is good.

 Pogs. 

In elementary all the cool rich kids had them. I was a poor immigrants son with no allowance. Our family was dirt poor. I'm talking hand-me-downs between the girls and boys. So naturally seeing all these kids playing this cool game at any chance they could really angered me because I couldn't even buy one. I decided to sneak a few away from some classmates thinking they wouldn't notice. The teacher caught me red handed. She called my parents for a conference so she could hand out my punishment. My parents asked what the consequences are and my teacher said "I need about tree fiddy"  it was about that time I noticed that wasn't my teacher but a 50 ft tall creature from the paleolithic Era. I said "get out of here you god dammed loch Ness monster"

 Taco pizza 




 Because its worded to make it seem wrong.

$30 - 5 = $25

So each man paid 8.33333333 + $1 refund. That leaves $2 as tip
