 That's priceless! 




 Hahaha! 




 The older woman is Indianapolis Motor Speedway  chairman Mari Hulman George. She has been making the "start your engines" announcement for a long time now. The younger woman is her daughter Nancy George and as someone mentioned, was probably thrown off by Mari's strange timing. That being said, do not play around with this feisty old broad. She does not look afraid to backhand a bitch if they step out of line.

 Oops I had that mixed up. I read the book a few years back and it slipped my mind. I will edit. 




 There is a great book titled, Brothers Forever, written about Brendan Looney and his friendship with Travis Manion. "The enduring bond between a Marine and a Navy Seal that transcended their ultimate sacrifice." These two guys were very special people and the book is a touching tribute to them. 




 The duster is strong in this one 




 The thing is that there are very few low demand areas in the Bay Area. It is absurdly expensive everywhere.

 Leo Dicaprio as my older brother. Models on models on models. 




 He's a Scientologist, which makes him 100x creepier...

 Came here to say that precise thing. Well done sir 




 That's not how the real estate market works. 




 The problem with selling your house now is that while you will see a sizable profit, you have to buy at the top of the market too. Sell high, buy high. Also, you have to pay capital gains taxes on your profit...

 True that, I was speaking specifically about women because that clown was saying it was ok. Hitting anyone is unnacceptable.  




 Please fuck off 




 Not from the South. I'm from a place where hitting women is never acceptable. You must be from that other place. 




 You don't know shit about me. Bottom line is that you don't hit women. The fact that you are trying to defend a man slugging a woman is deplorable.  




 Who are your friends if this situation has presented itself more than once? 




 Hey, do me a favor, shut your face. There is no justifying coldcocking a woman in that manner. Peddle your bullshit elsewhere.
