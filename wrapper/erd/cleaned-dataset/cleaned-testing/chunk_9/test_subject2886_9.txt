 Swiss and white cheddar on rye with honey and red pepper flake. 




 You went to Denny's. 




 Really?! I'm from Bloomington and the Dreaded Breaded is everywhere (that's at least what my family always calls them). 




 Pretty much any curry benefits from a long simmer. I love my crock pot for dal (lentils), but I'm not sure if that counts as a grain.

I don't have my own recipe, but tortilla soup can be made as spicy as you want. Same with chili, but I won't open that can of worms because I'm a beans-in-chili heathen. 




 I may have to do this to my various suitcases, even though I make a point to only buy distinctive ones. 




 Depending on how sad, the album Everything to Everyone by Barenaked Ladies has so many good ones. Aluminum, Unfinished, and Take it Outside are good for first level sad. My Love, Next Time, and For You are second level. Upside Down is my ultimate angry song. War on Drugs is my favorite song ever, but it's a real tear jerker. 




 This has been my ringtone for almost a year. 




 I've had white corn, I was thinking more that it seems over cooked. 




 Only looks shitty because there's not nearly enough gravy and the corn makes my Hoosier heart cry. 




 Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear in Golden-I. Don't got the money for OPI. 




 I love me sone gin. About to get a handle of New Amsterdam. This was just because I was broke last week. 




 Also a girl. I guess being a good friend means my own problems don't matter. 




 Also just spent my second night in a row that I passed out before taking my meds.

My friends are fucking nuts, and pretend to love me while I hide behind a fucking smile. I'm supposed to be there for someone who blacks out every day and repeats over and over about how much it sucks to have people falling for her all the time, while I'm so fucking alone that I can't even get laid when I try. And she fucking ignores me when I start to cry.

I need better friends. 




 Went out last night to see Whitest Kids U Know again. Almost got kicked out because my friend was too drunk. Then we went to the only gay bar in town, they stopped serving me and she got legit kicked out. Then I went to a house show, got my knee kicked in while trying to dance.

Just waking up now, still drunk. 









 Plant birches. Creepy ghost trees for your creepy forest cemetery. 




 Waiting for Across the Universe to finish downloading. Musicals and gin help me forget my problems. 




 Watch Mamma Mia. Fuck my neighbors, fuck my only class tomorrow, fuck people, fuck boys who don't understand going through a handle of gin every 3 days. 




 Last time I had Jungle Juice, it was just cheap vodka and Hawaiian Punch. Mix accordingly. 




 Lauren?

......if you get this joke, you know where I live. 




 The really shitty local channel in my Southern Indiana town had basically the same thing for a while like 8 years ago. At 3:30am, still not naked. 




 And as someone who is nuts for peas, I'll have to try it, too! 




 I have a shit ton, too. My GP looks at the big ones every once in a while, but even the irregular ones have always been fine. If they start to hurt or change, go to the doctor; otherwise, you're probably fine. 









 Because I just got an IUD implanted. Too bad I'm too crampy to go to the ATM and my guy has already left for Spring Break. 




 Seasons 6 and 7 don't hold candles to the rest of the series. But I'm also the type of person to have it going pretty much constantly as background noise, because I don't even want to know how many times I've watched it through. 




 We always called them One-Eyed Egyptians. But I've never heard that outside my family. 




 I can't personally do this, but I know the people who run these events on campus, and they're super awesome people! 









 I use my friend's sometimes, and got one years ago for my multiple joint sprains and dislocations. A brace is still necessary most of the time, but it can keep the pain from being too bad. In my experience, at least. 




 Thanks, now I'm overwhelmed with my earlier desire to order a pint of mac and cheese. 




 Same thing if you ate a lot of chili. 




 More than sort of. 




 Crying now because of the news of Leonard Nimoy's death. But I agree. Trek is my ultimate escape.

Edit: may you all Live Long and Prosper. 




 My joints make it impossible to leave my apartment on a weekly basis. I did ballet for 9 years, so I'm used to sprains, dislocations, slipped disks. I'm 22 years old and have arthritis.

I slipped on the ice on my way to class Thursday morning. It didn't hurt too badly, so I didn't bother going to the Health Center on campus. Since then, it has gotten worse and worse. I serioualy think I may have re-dislocated the knee I injured last winter.

And I don't care. I've been wanting to cut again recently, so the pain from this injury is actually making me feel better. It wakes me up at night, it takes me 5 minutes to walk from my living room to my bathroom, I start crying when my cats decide to climb into my lap, but I don't want to see a doctor about it.

The guy I've been seeing thinks I have to go, even though I know that the doctor will only say things I already know (stay off it, wear your knee brace, ice and heat), but he doesn't know my history with self harm. He knows I'm depressed, and that I've been through an abusive relationship, but not that I've cut on and off for 10 years. 




 Another excuse to drink gin and eat rosemary? Sounds good to me. 




 It's just another way of frying an egg. Look up the crispy egg. I will never turn back. 




 We even have it up here in IN, also at Kroger. 




 If you can steel yourself for a trip over to Ellettsville, the hill in front of Edgewood High School is great. But, you have to go to Ellettsville. 




 Especially when you realize how sharp that knife has to be. 




 http://www.chocolatemoosey.com/2014/06/26/strawberry-layer-cake-with-cream-cheese-frosting/

I love this strawberry cake. I do usually put on chocolate icing, but it's great on its own, too. 




 Haha, I'm actually watching that season right now. Really really good. 




 Happy Birthday, Romeo!
My furbabies have a shared birthday next month, also almost 2. Here's to furbabies for the next 10-20 years! 




 That's a great idea! However, this yarn is so beautiful and soft that I want ro make something to wear (for the past month, all I've done is rub my face on the skeins). 




 I do love arm warmers, maybe I can use the silk blend for that. They would feel much nicer than the long acrylic ones I made a couple years ago. 




 I'm thinking a beret, at least of the peacock. I already have an amazing winter hat that I've worn every cold day for three years, but maybe I have enough for a nice fall/spring hat. 




 So, for Xmas, I got a gift certificate for my LYS. I mainly got some gorgeous wool, but also got two skeins just because they were pretty, which I never do.

http://www.imgur.com/bhqzu4n.jpeg

Here they are. The peacock one is 100g (197yd), 70/30 acrylic/wool, and the other is only 50g (109yd), but 75/25 wool/silk.

I'd like to make something I can use on a regular basis, but don't know any patterns for this small of an amount. Since I've never bought yarn without a project in mind (I know, you'd think I would have after nearly 13 of crochet), I'm stumped. Plus I've had afghans on the brain for the last year or so.

So, anyone know of good patterns for small amounts of yarn? 




 More pictures of Bill, and one with his sister, Kate.

 I think I grew an extra pair  




 I keep seeing this around here and keep wanting to find it in real life so I can learn tatting, haha. My Grandmommy taught me all the other things, but tatting died with my great grandma on the other side. 




 Looks like a modified star stitch, but I'll let OP identify it exactly. 




 I went with kitties because of a foster failure and needing a low key companion, since I'm still a student. As much trouble as they can pose (playing with or chewing through yarn), they are necessary. 




 Congrats! 


I'm super single, but still look to things like this for my future wedding. I thought I was crazy for wanting to make my own wedding cake, haha. 




 I just want to share something my non-crafty sister posted on Facebook a few days after I gave her an afghan: "A handmade blanket is like a permanent hug from the person who made it."

It brought a tear to my eye, and reminds me of why we all make things for the people we love.

Edited to correct the quote. 




 Oooh, je t'aime, tu es trop mignon/ne. Or maybe it's just that my (American) cats seem to respond better to French. Sophistication and such. Mine know "tu sais mieux que ca" and "ne mange pas cela, ce n'est pas la nourriture" better than "you know better than that" and "don't eat that, it's not food." 




 My Katie was a failed foster, haha, but if you can let them go, fostering is a wonderful way to get some kitty love in your life. 




 The orange one miiiight be big enough for all of these. I also have a boatload of bigger rectangle scarves that I love for using as mid Spring skirts. Thanks for the tip! 




 That is beautiful, thank you! And I think it will look good with the orange one that is an all over pattern, 




 That napkin style is how I always wear square scarves. The first style is also lovely, I'll have to try it.

Since I usually don't have a purse with me unless I'm going out (where I do not at all want to take a vintage silk Liz Claiborne scarf, haha), I won't do that style, although I love it with cheaper scarves. Thank you! 




 I recently got these three gorgeous scarves from my Grandmommy. They are all fairly light, and have at least some silk in them. The mint one and the pale pink (looks white in the photo) are both Liz Claiborne, and my sister got several Liz ones as well.

How would you style these? Today I'm wearing a mint sweater with the mint scarf, dark blue skinny jeans, and short heels in a similar color (it's gonna get up to 40F here, so I only need my stupid looking warm hat for a few hours).

Edit: she will be 93 in March, so all of these scarves have stories behind them. I know how to care for them, but styling is not my forte. 




 I'd easily kill the seaweed ones in one sitting, and I'd have to try the blueberry. I could see them being quite nice. 




 I'm not even a huge fan of walnuts, but that cake sounds wonderful! 




 Is it only when they're alone? Like, do you like custard? I have plenty of friends who gag at runny yolks, which just means I never cook eggs for them. 




 I don't know exactly. The taste and the texture just don't do it for me. 




 Seconded, although that's oartly becwuse it's mostly mayonnaise or Miracle Whip round these parts. 




 Haha, I love okra! I eat it raw like a carrot! To each his own. 




 As long as you've tried it several times, it seems fine by me. People have different tastes. I just tried pickled herring again for the first time in years this Xmas season (my family is Scandinavian, so pickled herring and spekemat are always there) and finally learned to love it, but still hated the hummus privded, too. 




 I'll add another, that no one I've ever met seems to understand: avocados. I have no idea what it is, but I have never met an avocado that doesn't make me want to turn away and restrain the gag reflex. 




 Does this still happen with onions that are cooked or caramelized?  




 My dad and sister both have the "cilantro tatses like soap" gene.  




 I'm similar. My thing is that liver and kidneys are filter organs. They filter the toxins out of the animal. Give me a fried brain sandwich and I'm happy, and I've recently gotten into buying ground beef heart, because a local farmer sells them to my favorite local grocery/health food store for super cheap, and super delicious. 




 I feel you on cheese. Only in the last few years have I been able to handle it, outside of pizza. And I still can only eat mild ones, and only when melted. 




 Ao glad I'm not the only one! It tastes like mud! 




 I used to be like that. The very smell made me nauseous. 




 That reminda me of when I decided I'd learn to like coffee when I studied in Frnace back in 2010. Mine went better, though, although now I can only drink really strong black coffee, haha. 




 I love black olives on pizza, but in any other context I can't even handle the smell. 




 I'd think Sunny D could be ok in a screwdriver, although I haven't been able to touch the stuff since I had a bottle that went rancid when I was 6 or 7. 




 Reminds me of when I was a little girl and decided to make gingerbread cookies for my swimming teachers. Misread the recipe and used baking soda instead of baking powder. Those things tasted awful. 




 I am always happy to cook for people who don't like certain foods, but personally will never say that until I have tried a food in every way possible, several times.

For me, I personally cannot stand chick peas. I've had them in stews, curries, falafels, hummus, what have you. Same thing with mayo. Alone, mixed with anything, the only time I think I've eaten it without gagging was when I had walnut shrimp in Chinatown in San Francisco this past May.

So, what else fall in this category for others? Sometimes you try hard to like something and just don't, and I think that is just fine. 




 For ones that aren't as super popular, /r/ladybonersgonecuddly, /r/askhistorians, and any of the subreddits for your hobbies, like if you crochet, /r/crochet is awesome 




 I'm 22 and still sleep with one every night. Same deal with my sister, who will br 27 in April. 




 It's Elmer the Patchwork Elephant!  




 Had it all the time when I was studying in France. Can't say it's amazing to my (quite broad) American palate, but good for spreading on crackers while waiting for the rest if the meal. 




 I really like how all the flowers are the same color throughout. I'm working on my first stuffed animal based on the african flowers (giraffe for me, since they're my favorite animal). 




 So jealous. It's 10F here right now, and I need to layer up to go grocery shopping. 




 Not to mention all of those Eye Witness kids documentaries. Those things were my favorite growing up. 




 Good to see some mulberries! Every summer I go around town every day for a week or so and pick as many as possible. I still have 2 full gallon sized bags in my freezer, so I think I'm gonna make one of these soon. 




 Some people don't like peas. I'm not one of them, and I don't understand them, but it is a matter of taste. Good on you. 




 22 year old female in Southern Indiana, USA. I'm a political science major and Arabic/French double minor, planning on taking a fifth year of college (and possibly picking up Dutch in that last year).

I live alone with two wonderful kitties, who are my life. I consider myself an intermediate crocheter; I have never done fancy stitches, but I can pretty easily draft patterns using the stitches I do know.

I hope to post more in 2015, and I hope to learn a lot more. 




 Still working on last year's to make blankets for all my family (and hopefully friends for graduations), but I'm also gonna make myself somthing nice, because I haven't done that in ages and I got a gift certificate from the local yarn store that my mom actually forbade me from using for someone else, haha. 




 I love that stuff! It's my grandmommy's favorite. 









 God, a shit ton of my Facebook friends do this. I've called a couple of them out on it, but they all just freak out and say that it works. 




 I was making a really dumb face, haha. 









 You can get anything at a restaurant or wineries/breweries, but that's it. 




 Weed is my #2 hangover cure, #1 being oatmeal, haha. But nothing but water prevents a hangover for me. 




 I absolutely cannot mix them, even though I'm experienced with both. 




 At least a store is open today. Even the Kroger by me closed at 6pm yesterday and won't open till 9am tomorrow, and it's open all day on Thanksgiving. 




 Could be shitty Indiana, where you can't buy any on Sunday at all, till 7am Monday morning. 




 They can be, but if you make sure to either use entirely separate utensils (including cutting board) or wash evrrything in super super hot water a couple times in between, it should be ok.

As for a smaller shrimp dish, I'm a huge fan of shrimp and grits. Look for any recipe, although when I'm lazy I just put the two together, mix a boat load of butter into the grits and smother it all in Old Bay. I know it's not traditional, and Old Bay isn't as common outside Maryland, but I can find it here in Indiana if I look hard enough. 




 Thank you so much for the detailed answer! This is wxactly what I need. 




 As I said before, I'm gonna play it safe, but I assume it would be like any other allergy. I have friends who suffer allergic reactions from secondary exposure, and that's why restaurants specially prepare items when a customer says they are allergic to something.

Better safe than sorry. 




 And this is why I'm gping to ask if she could bring some untainted utensils. We're going to be cooking together, because that's our thing, but I want to keep her from getting sick. 




 Good to know! Thanks!  




 My friend has legit Celiac's, as in she gets very sick for days after ingesting any gluten at all. So I'm gonna play it safe and not use anything with gluten at all, including any utensils that have touched flour. I want to share the holiday spirit, not make her sick when it wanted to be nice.

Edit: I also have the experience of a father who needed an epi pen after eating sonething fried in peanut oil, so I'd rather be safe than sorry. 




 Good idea. I was planning on making some chili anyway (and yes, I'm a "bean in chili" heathen), so I will definitely include this in my soup-a-palooza. 




 Thank you! We both love soups that kinda require a roux or some type of flour covered seared meat, so this is very helpful!

Edit: plus we like to cook fairly in depth recipes together, so the fact that I have a copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking plays a bit of a part. We both think of Julia Child as a personal hero, so it's been hard to adapt.
