 Yeah I've still been doing deadlifts. The trouble isn't so much the joints themselves, but that the doctors don't want the muscles to overdevelop in the wrong direction and then be more difficult to correct after the surgery.  




 I'm having joint trouble in my knees and because of that I can't do squats until I have a surgery. I know it's a really useful exercise to build core back and leg muscles, so are there any more isolated exercises that I can use to get similar results? 




 Hey I just wanted to ask where you guys started seeing muscle growth first when you started making gains? I've been at it for a month, and while I've started seeing gains on my arms shoulders and chest, I've gained a lot more muscle on my back then anywhere else. Did you find that a certain muscle group developed a lot faster than other ones did when you started? 




 Yea I'm finding it really sobering. I knew I had depression, but had a feeling there was something more to it. Somethng else interesting that came up after she diagnosed me is that I'm not an introvert, I'm more of an extrovert whose being limited by symptoms of ptsd. I also don't have traditional social anxiety, it's more rooted in years of traumatic experiences and problems trusting people. Really the diagnosis makes a lot of sense when I look back on things.
 




 I recently moved to a new city and have been seeing a new therapist to manage my anxiety and depression. For the last few sessions we've been going over my difficulties and getting used to each other. For the first few sessions I described my problems with interacting with people, feeling unable to connect with others, problems with concentration, and "brain fog." For the first few session she said I definitely have social anxiety and suffer from depression. This is pretty much what I've been told before, and that's fine I knew what I had to work on.

That is until the last few sessions where we spoke about more specific issues. It came up that I actually have dissociative issues with my appearance and identifying or experiencing my emotions. It's to the point where I almost can't describe myself. I started talking about bullying that I experienced as a kid, moving to different towns several times, babysitters with mental issues, and the rejection that I've had from other kids growing up. 

Some examples; Literally my first social interaction that I remember outside of my family is a neighbour kid jumping on my back (with no provocation, the kid had issues) and biting a chunk out me. This happened when I was five, it was a deep bite and I had to be on antibiotics for a while. When i was ten another kid with emotional issues in the neighbourhood tried to crush me with a washing machine that was lying around. This kid had it planned out and booby-trapped. It would have permanently injured me or killed me easy. Had babysitter who'd leave my brothers and I outside for hours in -30 weather for hours and refuse to let us inside. In highschool I lived in a very isolated community where I never really fit in to the very small town community. I can remember taking so much shit from my "friends" then. People who unfortunately still manage to keep themselves in my larger social circles. 

Anyway, when I was talking about my highshcool "friends" with my therapist I was clenching my jaw the whole time without realizing it. My therapist pretty much stopped me and told me that I almost certainly have C-PTSD and that most of my anxiety, body, social, and depression issues stem from it. It's almost refreshing how much it seems to make sense.  




 This is my personal example.  I have an ex-girlfriend (who I've been friends with for years)  who's been confiding in me a lot about her depression and feelings of loneliness. I have experience struggling with the same problems, and I have a lot of advice to share, but I know I can end up talking about my own depression. I don't really know what to tell her when she says something like "I just feel empty," other than "I feel that way a lot of the time too." I've told her that I don't know how to deal with those problems myself, so I'm not the best person for her to talk to. I do listen to what she has to say and I give honest input, but I feel like maybe I should just not talk and listen more. 

Is it better to give input and try to share your relevant experience and feelings? or is it better to just sit and listen? I'm just looking for advice on how to be a better comforter 




 I've been playing guitar for years, but have only recently made the effort to start writing on it. I'm a piano player and I have my theory down, so that's helped a lot, but I find I'm stuck on strumming chords. It's really difficult trying to make a song sound more interesting when I'm just hammering out some chords. How can I learn to play and write more textured guitar parts, instead of just strumming chords?  




 Whenever I get "stuck in my head" (as my friends and family have started calling it) I look at the ground. I just completely check out and let my thoughts go, and I'm only vaguely aware of what's happening around me when I'm thinking like that. I've had to make a conscious effort to walk with my head up and shoulders back, so that it looks like I have some self-esteem haha.  




 I just started physiotherapy to correct knock knees and hyperextension. My physiotherapist has recommended that I don't do heavy squats as part of my workout routine, until we make some progress with correcting my knees. Pretty much they don't want my knees strengthening in the wrong direction. What are some other exercises that I can do that'll work similar muscle groups as squats, but in a different way? 




 I know! haha I've just got to go to relax about it, but I think I'm still getting over getting this attention in the first place.  




 Over the past few months I've been working hard on building up my confidence. I've been working out, meeting new people, and being a more assertive person. It seems like it's been working, because I've noticed that whenever I make eye contact with girls I'm passing on the street, or around campus 9 times out of 10 I get an insanely cute and genuine smile. I'm not used to getting such open body language from girls and I need to how to approach them.

Does a "hey, how's it going?" work or should I say something about their appearance/smile. Day game is new territory for me, so I need your advice to get me started.

 




 Do you still get the benefits of the boost after the 7 day mark. I mean other than turning me into a horny animal, I'm concentrating better and getting way more things done, so it'd be great if that stays. 




 I'm 21 and this is the second time I've made it to one week and I'm finding it horribly difficult. I'm horny all the time, I stare at girls constantly and just can't stop thinking about fucking them. I spent a whole three hour class today imagining what the girl sitting across from me looks like when she cums. I only slept for an hour last night because I my heart was beating like mad and I was sweating. When I woke up, I was UP, it didn't feel like I missed any sleep because of the feeling of adrenaline. I've been hitting on my friends constantly and I can't seem to help it. It just blurts out like a natural response. Pretty much if I can make a sexual comment I do, and I mean it most of the time. 
I've also been having whole days where I just wake up in a rage/depression and stay like that all day.

A big problem is that I haven't been meeting a lot of people at university since I took a year off and I'm having a hard time making those social connections that would lead to meeting women.

The worst part is I live off campus (not too far) at my university, and all day I'm just feeling resentful of all the people who are just hooking up in dorms and meeting women through the campus community. 

I've been hitting the gym hard, but I'm trying to gain weight and muscle so I'm only going a few times a week so I don't burn off all my extra calories. So going for runs is pretty much out of the picture. Meditating's been fine, but I have to fight my way from sexual imagery.

I feel nauseous and like I have a headache constantly, but I can't fall asleep and feel like I'm rushing with adrenaline all the time. 

Do you have any advice to help me push through this? 




 I'm my experience, the best thing to do when someone snubs you is to just leave the conversation and don't contact them until they contact you. If they're actually interested they'll get a hold of you and be more accommodating next time. People who think they don't need to meet you half way in a conversation are wasting your time.
 




 Yes! Your last line is a really good way of putting how I feel after work. I work at a coffee shop and I know I go into an autopilot mode to get me through the day. By the time I leave work at the end of a shift I feel really scattered and can't collect myself till I'm away from work and doing another activity. The only other time I feel like how I do when I'm finished a long shift of repetitive tasks is when I'm waking up or over tired.  




 I can't take mundane activities, but other people around me seem to manage them just fine. I work at a coffee chain and an 8 hour shift is often too mind numbing for me. I get off work feeling numb and drained, because my brain stopped working half way through it. I find most of my coworkers manage the grind of everyday better than I do and don't let it outwardly get to them. 

How do mundane tasks or jobs affect you? 




 nope I just had short term dating and out to make friends on my profile, so there's no way to mix that up there. 




 So I had a really great night with a girl the other night. The date went great and we had sex afterward, it wasn't great sex as we'd both been drinking a bit. I don't think I'm really too physically attracted to her and I'm not really interested in anything serious. What's the best way to communicate that I'm sort of "playing the field" and that's kind of where I am right now? 




 NT people talk to themselves too. I mean they try to hide it as much as possible, but especially under stress everyone talks to themselves.  




 Was for a while. It was a sedative too, so I didn't feel like I could get any creative momentum, and it gave me some pretty serious brain-fog.  




 Almost every person I've ever been close to tells me that I overthink things. The thing is that, especially in social situations, I have an uncanny ability to know what is going to happen or how people are going to act and react. My analyses usually bother people, especially in personal conversations, and frustrates me because I feel like they don't have the same investment that I do in whatever we're talking about. 

I do actually overthink things sometimes, and I've got myself in some pretty serious thought loops that caused really bad anxiety. I'm more aware of it now than before, but I still struggle with it. I usually keep my opinions and thoughts to myself, because I usually go much deeper into my analysis than a lot of people ever care to.

Here's followup answers.

- I was talking to a friend who I've occasionally been romantically involved with about how our relationship is a lot more complicated than what we like to admit to each other. She told me I overthink things ha. 

- Not for a long time. But I don't often share a lot of my opinions or thoughts, because not many people want to get as in-depth into things as I do. 

- I suffer from depression and anxiety. I dealt with existential depression for about a year, and still struggle with general anxiety. I've had depressive episodes for years, but as I get older and understand it better I feel I'm starting to manage them. 

- The female form is honestly the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I'm a straight male, but even aesthetically there's just something pleasing about women. 

- My biggest dream is to write something that means something to people beyond myself. 

- Biggest fear is to lose my mind. 

- We can't, but I don't think that matters. 

- My day felt very long, and I have a headache, because I drank too much coffee. 

It's nice to overthink sometimes, especially when it gives you a chance to sort out whatever it is you're thinking about. 


 




 I've noticed that when I'm tired I'm terrible at socializing. I make stupid comments, I mumble, I can't think of anything to say or what to talk about (unless it's something about myself), I complain about things, I can't hide my emotions, I stumble over my words, I don't listen well, and I'm not as aware of how the people around me are feeling. It's embarrassing and I feel like I don't deal with it as well as other people around me. 

I find I have a lot more trouble with this at work than anywhere else. This is a real problem because I work at a coffee shop and being tired really kills my ability to interact with customers and coworkers. I can't hold a conversation, and it makes it difficult to connect with the people I work with when I'm having trouble halfway through an eight hour shift. 

When I'm feeling good and energized I'm usually pretty quick on my feet and friendly, but being even a little tired makes me dull and anxious. 

Do any of you have advice for staying socially energized? or being able to maintain when I am tired?

EDIT: Posted this after a long shift at work; Just look at that title.  




 It's a very safe, very relatable topic that almost anyone can feel comfortable participating in. Everyone knows what the weather's like, what it's been like and how to compare it to other weather they've experienced. It's also a good transition topic to other things like where someone is from or where they've travelled before. The weather is most people's go to because it's easy and they prefer talking about it to silence.  




 Knowing everything about your sexuality might be unneeded, but from what I can gather, sexuality is a large part of most people's psyche and development. There are things in your development and behaviour that he was probably looking for. Just me hazarding a guess. 




 I've been thinking about how I speak and come across to others.  I've been looking for alternatives to the generic slang terms I've been using since I was a kid. Terms like "cool", "awesome", "sweet", "what's up?", and calling friends "man" or "dude" seem childish and outdated. I especially fall back on these terms when I'm feeling anxious, and it makes me feel like people see me as immature.

I'm not sure if this is even a thing that other people notice or not, but I'd like to hear your input on it. Do you think it's something I should work on What do you think I could do to developing different default default language.

Just to give some context, I'm 21 and male.  




 When I'm anxious and trying to talk to someone I think I come across upset and impatient. I default to a lower voice, and don't have as much control over my intonation as I usually do. This can be really off putting, especially when I didn't start the conversation anxious, and then gradually slip into seeming impatient and angry. 

Any advice on how to mange this better? 




 Sexuality is a large part of most people's behaviour. If a psychiatrist doesn't understand your behaviour, how are they supposed to help you? 




 I find that whenever I'm tired I don't talk much, and get into a very bad mood. This has affected how I act at work, especially early morning shifts. I know I get remote and impatient, but when I'm really tired I can't seem to help it. What's the best way to manage being over tired when you have to be social? 




 I've moved to a city with a very lively night life, and because of this I have to deal with a lot of drunk people walking around at night. I'm a 21m and on any given night I might have to walk past scores of drunk people to go to and from pubs or friends places or walk home from work. A lot of drunk guys my age show off by screaming at and trying to belittle any other guy who's walking by them. I'm in shape, and dress well, I usually look put together, and I'm beginning to feel like that's a factor in how aggressive other guys are when I'm walking alone at night. For example I was walking home tonight and a couple guys just start harassing me for drinking a bottle of water as I walk by, I literally got a "You like that bottle of water faggot?" shouted at me. I had a few comments I could have thrown back, but nothing I felt would be really affective. Is there a way of dealing with them without starting a fight? I feel like ignoring them is a too passive, but confronting them could end up with me picking my teeth up off the sidewalk.  




 Haha I'd like to think that's how someone would see it
