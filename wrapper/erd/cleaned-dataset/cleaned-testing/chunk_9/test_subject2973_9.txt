 Yep, he's a *muslim*, not a Muslim. 

Intoxicating substances like alcohol, weed, etc.  are not allowed and pig is not allowed neither is tobacco.  




 No one is free of sins, at least drinking is not hurting anyone. 
Do you know how many times I've turned the TV on and the news guy is reporting about how this drunk driver the killed this family coming back from vacation or some family get together?

 




 Explain?  




 Alcohol is haram in the same fashion yet everyone drinks openly. 

maybe on pizza or something like that at most. 

You can't do any of these, like never, not even on pizza. 

 




 But he was drinking alcohol?  




 I call those *Muslims* 1-monthers

 No, it is not, because your standard of living only gets you the basics: food, shelter, utilities, clothes at $2400 USD. Oh and *quality is important*  

Edit: you can't just go out buy thing's when needed, want a good used car because your current one is beyond repair? Well good luck! Finance it? Not a chance, look at the interest rates!   




 But you can, in a way, like how multinational corps market and cater to foreign customers.

 True Islam is not sociopathic whatsoever.  




 Whats that?  




 *Extreme-right-wing-sociopathic-wahabi-let's-twist-up-Islam-for-our-own-gain- version-Islamic.* 




 By saying that it's not Islam related is just demonstrating how little you know about Islam. Islam decrees that any artifacts that predate Mohammed should be destroyed.  

I tried googling that but I found nothing. I will admit that my knowledge of Islam is not that of a scholar.

But I'll say this, if artifacts that predate Mohammed should be destroyed is truly a thing, and please cite as I couldn't find it, then during Mohammed's time, when he was alive, during the Abbasid and Umayyad Caliphates, then ancient sites that predated Mohammed would have ALREADY been destroyed. 

 




 Isolationism like after WW1 




 Ahhh, its part of maintaining their image as the protectors of Islam when in reality they are selling the loot to buy AK-47s.  And its working because the way people are viewing ISIS actions: not as looters that sell treasure and oil for AK47s  but as vandals that are destroying to protect religion.   Also, by skewing perception as Muslims are evil, their acceptance rate increases because westerners bully the Muslims causing them to leave and join ISIS.  

Edit: 
Its is plausable that meusium prices are catalogued thus you can't get very much because they are known about as a result easy to track. So they destroy them for propaganda. 

Also is it me or on their videos and pictures they are destroying bigger artifacts due to them being harder to smuggle?  




 I agree to an extent, it is to rationalize their twisted un-islamic religious beliefs.  




 Hipster millionaires wet dream! 




 Trust me its not Islam realated.  Religion is just a ruse for ISIS. Its all trickery not in the name of God but for Power. 

'"Conflict antiquities" are artifacts that are looted, smuggled and sold to illicit dealers around the world, with the proceeds going to fund military or paramilitary activity. Unesco estimates that globally trade in conflict antiquities could be worth more than $2.2 billion and growing as criminal groups recognize the value in very, very old things.'

"The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which has taken over large swathes of land in Iraq and Syria, is selling ancient Iraqi artifacts in the black market to finance its military operations in the region, Iraqi and Western officials said."

 Who doesn't want a 2000 year old column on the front steps of their mansion?  




 Destruction of Palmyra is not because of Islam, if Islam is the reason then Palmyra world have been destroyed hundreds of years ago. ISIS is going to destroy Palmyra for the loot so they can finance their war machine. Its all a show for the west.

 When your country is underdeveloped, you need assistance from other people, usually they are from the west because that's where all the best universities are and that's why rich Asians send their kids to USA, Canada to study, when Cambodia devolps, they can take care of themselves. For now they just focus on food, shelter, and water.
