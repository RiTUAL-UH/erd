 I'm making the drive from Ohio with a few friends. PM me if you end up going and we can say hey. 






















































 That's the bigger issue to you? 




 I'll try and remember the donotlink for DM in the future. Thanks for the heads up. 





























 Tyrael. His ults are Judgement and Judgement, right? Being able to double cast it would be awesome. 






















































 Literally true. 




 Interestingly enough, it used to be illegal for men to be publicly topless as well. In 1936 men changed the laws, because they were tired of having to wear a shirt when it's hot, but women got left (and still remain) behind. 




 Missed your primary? 




 Well, the average of his 250,000 donations was something like $33. That suggests that it's mostly people. Conversely, Hillary raised 3 times as much money with 5 times fewer (50,000) people donating, which suggests that her donors are making significantly larger donations. 




 Call them and ask. You never know. 




 No, sorry. I misunderstood what you were asking. 




 /r/SandersForPresident has a lot of good resources (check out the side bar). Also check out /r/Michigan4Sanders. 




 Have you been to [Bare Oaks](http://www.bareoaks.ca/) yet? 




 Stay the course! 












































 That's good. I listen to NPR primarily, and they don't give him much attention, beyond a passing comment here and there. 




 The primary is going to be the real race of this election cycle. I'm pretty confident that if Bernie wins the nomination, he'll win handily in the general. And with all of the energy in this grassroots campaign and the bi-partisan support he's getting, if he can't beat Hillary, no one can.

So by the end of the democratic primary, we'll know who our next president is. 






















































 Thanks. I'll be sure to try one! 




 Social media, yeah. He's under-represented in the mainstream media.

 This was really cool. Thanks for sharing!

What's the first addiction, BTW? It looks delicious. 




 You have to wear sunscreen, just like everyone else. Swimsuits don't really offer much protection from the sun. 















































































 I like your username. 










































































 So right. 




 Thanks!

 I fully agree. Unless you're playing at a professional level, every hero is viable and perfectly fine to play. Consider comp, of course, but there are probably a hundred other things that are going to make a far larger impact on the game than a particular hero's balance. 




 You mean people? 




 This is great.  











































































































































 I think it has to do with what can happen to you if you're caught with/using marijuana. I think if it's decriminalized, it means you can still be fined and/or charged with a low class misdemeanor, but if it's legalized then there is no penalty (possibly up to a certain quantity).

I don't know for sure, though. 




 I'd imagine most people will opt for shoes (I know I will) but actually there are people that run barefoot independent of nude recreation. I couldn't tell you why, though, but there's like a whole movement for it.

Some commonly asked questions:

**Do I have to be naked?**

For the race, no. Clothing optional. I don't know about afterwards at the resort. Normally it's nude-only, but since the event is CO, they may make an exception at the resort (though definitely not in the pool). Call to verify.

**Why naked?**

Why not? Seriously,  attend any socially nude event, and within 5 minutes not only do you forget that everyone is naked (including yourself), but you also forget why you cared in the first place. You stop seeing "naked people" and you just see "people".

More to the point, it's incredibly freeing to be casually naked with others. There's no judgement, no shame, no staring, no prejudices, no barriers, and no pointless swimsuits.

You really have to try it to fully understand it, but once you do, you'll be hooked.

**What if I don't look good naked?**

One of the other things that becomes immediately apparent in a clothing optional environment is that nobody has a perfect body, and that's okay. You often hear people make remarks like "nudists are usually the people you don't want to see naked". That misses the point entirely (you don't go to *see* people naked, you go to *be* naked and to relax and have fun), but there is some truth in it in that many people attend clothing optional events/clubs because they want to learn to love (or at least stop hating) their bodies. Years, even decades, of body shame melt away almost immediately once you let go of the fear and shame embrace the idea that there's nothing wrong or embarrassing about your body.

Plus, everyone is naked, so nobody is going to judge, look down on, or gawk at you.

**Is this about sex?**

No. On the contrary, most nudist resorts (including this one) are family oriented, which means any overt sexual activity or sexual advances would result in the offender being immediately thrown out, and most likely arrested. A good rule to follow is if it would get you in trouble at a community pool or rec center, it will get you in trouble at a nudist resort (except taking your clothes off, of course).

Despite what society would have us believe, nudity is not inherently sexual (just as something sexual does not necessarily involve nudity). This is another one of those things that you just have to experience to fully believe, but within minutes the nudity becomes normalized and you quickly see there's nothing sexy about it. It's just people.

**What if I become aroused?**

You won't.

**But what if I do?**

You won't. Every guy worries about this their first time, but it's never an issue. The advice that always given is that if the wrong thought or breeze or whatever causes a situation, just go swim or lie belly-down on your towel for a minute, but I've never seen or heard of anyone actually having to do this.. Nudists are open-minded, accepting people (and they're all naked too), so if that were to happen, as long as you didn't provoke, flaunt, or maintain it, nobody is going to care (or probably even notice, people will be looking you in the eye, not the crotch).

Trust me, this is about as sexy as going to the doctor, you really won't have an issue.

**What if it's that time of the month?**

Nudist clubs always allow women to wear bottoms (even in the pool) if it's that time of the month. I don't see that listed on Sunshower's website, but it's almost certainly the case.

**What should I bring?**

A towel, which you'll use not only to dry off if you go swimming, but also to put down any time you want to sit down (no bare butts on chairs!). You'll also want plenty of sunscreen (I'd bring both a 30SPF and something lighter like an 8 to re-apply if you're not completely dry), and some money for food/drinks. You might also want to bring a book, frisbee, tennis racket (I see a court on the website, though it probably also doubles as a volleyball court), etc.. Other than that you just need an open mind and a smile!

**Other questions**

Feel free to ask.


Hope to see you there!

 John Oliver. I'm pretty sure I already have. 


































  You do realize that this doesn't automatically mean "the poor" or _____ are going to be forced into 7-8-9 days straight of work.

It doesn't automatically mean that, but it does probably mean that. 




 You don't see fat men in bikini tops, do you?

More to the point, it's a matter of equality. I have the right to not wear a shirt at the beach/pool/front yard if I choose to. Women do not (in most places). 









 Sadly it's too old (it's from January). 




 Exactly.

 Thanks. I'll move it. 




 Oops. Deleted. Thanks for the heads up. 



















 Absolutely.
