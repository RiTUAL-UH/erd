 Did he shoot the man in Reno just to watch him die? 









 Thanks but the other device is wiped clean. 




 I bought a new phone today and used the backup and restore options on my old phone and new phones respectively. When i tried to restore, it couldn't restore. Help me please. I love playing this game. It bothers me more that i recently bought the garbage man. 




 I can get it under $2.30/gallon around here. 




 Gatorade. I'll take that lifetime supply. 




 My store is open on thanksgiving if enough employees volunteer. 




 At my store (close to a university) we've had 200 pie orders on many occasions. 




 I started as a driver (still a driver) but on day one I trained on every crew level operation except for the make line. It seems odd to me not to train people that way. 




 Same here. We had a rough week. The roughest I've ever seen. The franchisee of the store I work at extended the fifty off until tomorrow... 




 I'm a delivery expert but the guys on the make line prefer the older version. I do enjoy not having to put in a zip code on a card swipe. 




 John C. McGinley. I'd like a scotch drinking rich guy so I can try expensive scotches. Also I'd like a mentor like Dr. Cox. 









 Thanks so much! That's the one. 




 Thanks. That looks like it but it doesn't have the swimming things. 




 Good find, but no. It looks like a music maker app you might find in the Windows app store but the individual notes are represented by little swimming shapes made up of little squares. It's web based. 




 I think I was here in this sub a while back and found this web based music app that was really cool. As you created parts of the song it had these little swimming things that represented each sound. It was cool but I've lost the link. 









 Not the plot but it'll do.
"Bullshit I can't hear you!" 




 Wow! You can identify a basic pizza. Hmm not impress. 




 I've got an 18 year old bottle of Glenlivet. Good stuff. 




 Thanks a lot. This is really helpful. 




 A little late, I know but I heard you have to pay for training courses to get into that. Wether or not that's true is fine, I just didn't want to walk into a scam. 




 North Mississippi here. No storms today was the first rain free day in a while (had plenty of rain and storms the last few weeks). Today was one of those busy for thirty minutes at a time with ten minutes in between kinda days. It sucked.  




 My wife! Bwahahaha! Just kidding... or am I? Seriously though, I ate two large hand tossed pizzas from Domino's back to back then ate four lava crunch cakes. 




 I would so fuck Skyler White from Breaking Bad. I don't care what anyone thinks. 




 Took so long because I've been driving but...
Drivers unite indeed! 




 Same here. I love my job. It's awesome. 




 I work for Domino's as a delivery expert and couldn't be happier. 




 I would install that patch if it would include an option of installing the ability to project dreams for review and for others to view. 




 I was in a dessert wasteland type place. Nothing around for miles. It's during the day and the sun is out on a cloudless day. I'm just wandering around aimlessly. Suddenly, I start to hover about two feet off the ground. All I can think is "wow, this is neat". So I just continue to wander around aimlessly but now I'm also floating. Now everything is suddenly dark but not like night time dark but like bad storm clouds dark. I'm now paralyzed. After a few seconds I'm moving but I'm not in control. I'm turned around after hearing a child's voice scream "Help me!" The voice sounded very distant, though it was two feet behind me. Directly behind me is a set of prison bars that only appear about six bars wide but I knew it would be impossible to get around. behind these bars is the child that screamed. He doesn't have eye balls, just sockets. He screams again and that scream sounds distant again. Then I start to scream a high pitched wail like a higher pitch than I can accomplish while awake. I do this scream in my dream and for real to the point it wakes up my wife. It's like a ghostly sound. I have a lot of dreams like this. The surroundings are slightly different but the base idea is the same. I'm floating around and suddenly I can't control where I go and there is always a kid trapped somewhere screaming for help then I scream. My wife wakes me up and then I can't sleep for a couple hours. 




 I'll tell you what my parents taught me. Every morning look in the mirror. If you're satisfied with what you're looking at, you've failed. What I mean is deeper than appearance. Are you better at your job/classes? Are you a better you than yesterday? Have you improved in any little way since yesterday? If you don't think you've improved yourself in twenty four hours, you aren't trying hard enough. Everyone struggles with something everyday. You'll never be perfect at anything but you still must be great at something. Don't worry how good Joe down the road is at x, just focus on how well you are at xyz. 




 Stop acting as though just because we're never going to know the pain of childbirth that any pain we do experience isn't pain. Getting kicked in the nuts doesn't hurt any less just because we'll never give birth. It still hurts like Hell. Saying stuff like "well, it's not like you pushed a human out of yourself" belittles our pain like that changes things. "At least you don't have to have periods". Just in case you were wondering, yes my pain is still just as painful. I'm still just as sore. It still Fucking hurts. I've never insinuated that getting kicked in the nuts is the same as child birth or periods. That's because my pain is exclusively a man's pain as your pain is exclusively a woman's pain. Neither gender will know the other's pain. Stop talking down what men go through. 




 I go through this all the time with my wife. After she rejects all my ideas I tell her to pick a place and she either gets mad because I won't decide our she picks the very first place I suggested. 




 Then there could be a super human universe.  




 I've gone for so long thinking I was the only one that has thought of this. 




 I've always said this. 




 I'd like to base my "what if" from yours. What if for every parallel you that dies, the other still living ones get a little stronger. So the final one still alive lives a long life. Which is why we have people who live 110+ years. So if you die, you're strengthening yourself in a parallel universe. 




 I fall in love with my wife all over again every morning when I wake up next to her and every night before I fall asleep.  




 Wrong button 




 Wtf is "bae"? 




 I just watched that the other night. That's one of my favorite scenes. 




 A million upvotes to this comment. I love that creation of the food gods. The only thing worth getting from KFC. 




 I prefer their lemon berry slush. The delicious chunks of strawberry and slices of lemon. Yum! 




 Steak* FTFY 




 If you're going with taco bell, anything with Baja sauce is awesome. I get a few sides of it myself. 




 KFC brought back the double down after its been gone for so long. It's the only thing I eat from there and I can't get enough. I just wolfed down 2 and I'm still hungry. 




 I made $146 in tips delivering pizzas today and I have to spend it all to fix my other car. 




 When I got medically separated from the Army or when I dropped out of college for a stupid woman. I can't decide. Those two happened immediately one after the other. 




 I had to teach that (and many other keyboard short cuts) when we first started dating. 




 Yeah I know it's bad. Thanks I'll look into it. 




 Thanks.
I add half a jug in the morning and the rest in the afternoon. 




 I deliver pizzas for a living so my car is my job. I've been losing coolant as though I've got an endless supply. I have spotted where it's ending up but not the actual leak source. Wherever it's leaking from the coolant falls onto other parts (I can't see the entire drip path and the hoses and what not are too tight together to fit my hand between) and the coolant makes its way under my car. So basically I'm having trouble locating the actual source of the leak. I do not own any pressure test device and the cheapest one I can find around me costs as much as a new radiator. I just want to know if there are any tips anyone can give me on finding the source of the leak. All help is greatly appreciated.
