 verified studies huh?

If you have actually seen these studies and thought for half a second you would realize how stupid they sound. Wind mills aren't made out of some special super intensive co2 spewing method.. its a big fucking fan and generator.. on a pole. A fucking kid in a hut in africa made one to gen power for his house, and charge phones for his village... he made it out of bike parts and a tiny generator.

but even then..its mounds and mounds of BS.

the telegraph an infamous denial rag.. published a story under the ominous title

[Wind farms will create more carbon dioxide, say scientists](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/windpower/9889882/Wind-farms-will-create-more-carbon-dioxide-say-scientists.html)

OH MY...

with the subtitle...

Thousands of Britains wind turbines will create more greenhouse gases than they save, according to potentially devastating scientific research to be published later this year

oh umm 

followed by

We contend that wind farms on peatlands will probably not reduce emissions we suggest that the construction of wind farms on non-degraded peats should always be avoided.

oh.. gee ok, well maybe they should have started with that part.

but even they...

Even the initial version of the calculator found that the carbon cost of a badly sited peat wind farm  on a sloping site, resulting in more drainage of the peat, and without restoration afterwards  was so high that it would take 23 years before it provided any CO2 benefit. The typical life of a wind farm is only 25 years.

no 100s of years.. and notice the caveat of the sloping site.. this is a worst case scenario.. and even then.. it still reduces emissions for a couple years. unlike coal, which emits every year you burn it.

but yeah they spun the ever fuck out of it.. replacing a carbon sink with a windmill... and then it had to be sloped and bad drainage, and even then they couldnt make windmills as bad as you say.


now maybe if we made the blades out of burning coal...
 




 well you have a point but dont think its totally unfair...

1 1967 budget adjusted for inflation is 37 billion and in 2015 its 18 billion.

so yeah its only double and not ten times.

and the [defence budget.. on the other hand, despite things are actually more peaceful.. has never dropped below 3.5% gdp.. ](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/defense_spending)

so i dont think its totally unfair to expect spending to be more consistent as a percent of gdp.

but yeah it looks a little less worse when adjusted for inflation.. but we still are operating with half as much.

 




 I saw my mechanic at the bank in my car.. said snarkily "i guess it is done then"

i do accept it was a test drive though, even though he was at the bank cashing his check.. my car was shit, no one was joy riding in that thing. 




 killing is just really evil and wrong.... unless the dude really really really sucks, then its ok.

life imprisonment is a worse punishment, people seem to think it isnt, because they dont want to die..but a dead guy doesnt give a fuck after you actually killed him. Where the guy behind bars is going to give a fuck about being behind bars for a long time 




 lol i only heard wtf, only cause i looked it up and that's what all the other articles complained about.

didnt hear i'll be damned until reading these comments.... and now i hear that fine. pretty cool.
 




 and its the same people who heard shit on records they played backwards.

omg our brains like to make sense of shit.. and thats why clouds sometimes look like faces... and sometimes jumbles of sounds will sound like words.. amazing. We are very pattern orientated.  




 I'm guessing its not that hot.

No one is sweating or fanning. no fans at the booths. Hot girls in pants. besides shocked she looks a little chilly.. i'd say 80 max. waters probably a little cold from just filling.

edit: yeah op says wyoming.. looking at their weather is highest they going to see this week is 83.  not that thats all that cool, but yeah that waters prolly not that warm atm.

edit:if you ever filled a pool even on a hot day, its a bit chilly, and sorry but there are a lot of large people there and no sweat.. down here, where is 95, everyones fanning and sweating. That waters probably a bit chilly for the likes of me.

 




 there was a talk where mr degrasse responded to the oft used quote

"if we can put man on the moon... why cant we"

where he educated people a bit about how much we spend on space these days

sigh... [pining for that 60s budget.. 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA#/media/File:NASA-Budget-Federal.svg) was 9x as much as this year, all adjusted.

and we are much more efficient and better these days.. with even half the budget of the 60s we would be doing amazing ass things. more amazing.

and of course there is the war examples. ALL of NASA since 1958.. all of it, the rovers, the moon, our part to the space station, hubble.. all the probes..cost overruns and all... all of it. 

[cost a little over 500 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA).. i know hard to believe. WE got gps, and better weather shit, and all this cool explorations,  we can communicate from middle of nowhere with sat phones, tv, and remote education, cooperative science. gps is so useful we all got a reader in our pockets. seeing hurricanes come... damn.

now iraq will  [cost us about 2.4 trillion in direct costs in total.. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_cost_of_the_Iraq_War)

1 trillion spent already.(but mind you this doesnt include the years of no fly zones and the first war)


maybe i'm not very forward thinking, but i cant point to anything i have that i wouldnt have had, had their not been an iraqi war. Except maybe more people that hate us. and that was less than a decade of spending. Idk, i like the gps  and weather shit and even the tv shit space provides over the war crap we spend on.. it just seems to have better ROI.


heavy heavy sigh at the people who say we spend too much on space.

 




 well i can see that but this instructor definitely meant it how it sounds. I can find the youtubes, if anyone questions their existence or my interpretation of the comment, but like i said, i dont necessarily agree with the dude, but he definitely has the qualifications.


 




 [A Florida man may be questioning his wardrobe choice after being arrested for methamphetamine and marijuana possession while wearing a T-shirt reading: "Who needs drugs. No, seriously, I have drugs."](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/john-balmer-arrested-while-wearing-i-have-drugs-t-shirt-n281226) 




 Not to disagree with you, but at least one programming instructor said programmers are inherently lazy, they are constantly trying to devise ways to get the computer to do tedious crap for them.


and i get what he is saying but there might need to be a new term for people who work really hard to achieve as much free time as possible versus those who just try to take as much free time as possible with no effort.
 




 well a small ice pick could help you hit the recessed reset button, some routers have.
 




 No the most fun thing to watch.

[the trouble with chicken](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/trouble-with-chicken/)

which I like to rename to a more accurate, less popular title.. the trouble with libertarianism.

tl;dw

its basically a story about a salmonella outbreak that killed people in the us just a few years back.. we knew were it was coming from. There just werent the regulations to do anything about it, and the company in question refused to pull their product. See we had whole chicken regs to prevent salmonella, just not for the way most people buy chicken, which is in parts.

tried to tell the people so they could vote with their feet but information doesnt spread fast and people arent always good at disseminating it.. or perhaps they just thought.. "well the shit on the shelf has to be safe or they wouldnt sell it".. either way people kept buying.


and now we got to deal with a people/country that have rules and regs we dont have representatives for.. yeah there are some import controls and protections, but most of us in techy land and some others i am sure, know china is the hot bed of false advertisement and its a bit annoying. 




 yeah i think it would still be hard to prove.  Not that he conspired and all, but that a diluted equity into a functional company is better than all the equity in a failed one. (and often there are share dilutions and share holders even vote for them sometimes) Even if it didnt work out. I mean your allowed to be stupid, it comes out to intent.

and even his 'confession', he states it was due to the fact that the 100 year old dinosaur would never realize the potential of their investment with full control.

Prolly a little late to say not a lawyer, and maybe one can slap me down, but I do think he could argue he was trying to do whats best for condi by reducing their shares and control, would leave them with more value than leaving them in control and letting them destroy reddit.(even if you think they did a good job of that themselves.. like i said, your allowed to be a crap ceo.. fiduciary duty doesnt say you have to be good, just you have to try to be good.) 




 theunwise1 writes like I do...a bit mistake prone, due to stupid fingers.

kyptonaut, is an expert in typese.. the language of typoists. And has graciously translated the comment, theunwise1 made, for those of you without such expertise in reading bad typing.


so let me translate the translator by combining the two comments.

I think the second guy also got whacked ~~I'm~~ *in the jewels ~~but~~ *by the shovel

not so sure on the *'s but i see a lot of folks expert at correcting me, use them, so i figure i would be safe and use them as well.


yeah idk if this makes sense to just one of you, i am happy. 




 seem

and thats one reason we do science, things arent always as they seem.


I don't see why the psychoactive chemicals in cigarettes wouldn't do the same.

Hmm, maybe, well no maybe about it, I'm not very educated in the actual physical and chemical effects 'psychoactive' chemicals have on the brain, nor am i educated in the least as to the physical attributes of schizophrenia, so just in case you might........Can you expand on why you assume this? I ask because most science, really hates assuming. Just because every berry i have found and eaten has turned out to not be poisonous, its not a truism to say that all berries arent poisonous. Perhaps there is a "psychoactive chemical' that helps schizophrenia and protects from its onset.

Of course this is wholly conjecture out of ignorance. However it always bothers me when people assume one thing should be like the other, because in their experience things like that are. Most birds fly, ostriches dont.

 




 well yeah you should quit.. thats pretty much a rhetorical question at this point.
 




 and they blame the nicotine? I wonder because there are similar studies with cannabis smoke, and the studies have had some of the same complaints you bring up.. but also, fairly sure it doesnt have any nicotine in it. 




 heavy alcohol users have the most concerns.

its scarier than it sounds, a lot of countries have a lot of underage drinking. our society  grew up with a lot of underage drinking. Thats not to say, ignore this science.. but dont let the small bit of alcohol you had as a preteen, keep you up at night, or even go to the doctor over it, simply due to this info.

we can almost always be healthier and do things better, this info helps us choose to do that. So you can tell your kids more than no. and use facts. 




 damn it brain, none of them words are bacon.. and breakfast was hours ago.. just quit it.


anyways back to the pict, this is one of those times, i would take the path less followed. 




 for a week on either side of the 4th
 




 I bet it gets thrown out.

There are rules, you can't just protest with bullhorns at 4 am.. but the anthem is arguable political speech and well this might be more difficult than just a noise complaint.
 




 "on call" is total bullshit for most of the low paying jobs.


"hey guess what, you cant do shit today, cause we might need ya, but if we dont, we aint paying ya shit"

 




 the heavy shit sucks. For sure.. and it can be hard to be frugal when its hard to buy in bulk. And its harder to do on a bike than most people realize. but if you got a bike, they make fairly cheap bike trailers that make groceries a lot easier... and biking harder.


 




 it used to be this way all over the south.. slowly the blue laws went away. My local walmart is still 24/6 




 if you want to 'see' some em wavelengths.... take out the spinning dish in the microwave. put some american cheese in there. FUCK YEA. 10 -15 seconds.. take out, your cheeze(it just should have a z) will have some regular hot spots, measure between centers and you have the wavelength.. divide by the frequency on the back of the machine and you get the speed of light.. f-n cool... so they arround 2-3 inches apart.... and thats why its hard to nuke ants.. not that you have ever tried but them little dudes avoid the hotspots... which is why a magnifying glass is much more effective than a microwave at burning ants.
 




 well it was kinda obvious...i mean the worst time for perk also is the worst time slot for ads on tradition entertainment.. shit kicks ass at prime time.. but 4am eastern.. not so much'

they should be more straight up.. I figure they are afriad people will just cut their phones off at the slow times, but i doubt it.. people just want to know whats going on. Earnhoney(not the best beermoney but a newish one).. they'll outright tell ya.. 'ran out of ads'.. its nice to see. it still crashy a bit btu i definitely like knowing whats going on more than not.

 




 eh wrong question. Its meaningless as posed. The question you want answered, is "how much do you guys get per phone on average".. which takes some caveats like locations and such.

on average per phone, i am getting about 60 cents a day without much effort besides restarting phones and clicking ok when they dont crash.

thats the info you need. "is it worth it" is meaningless and subjective.. earnings per day isnt. bill gates would laugh, homeless people sleeping behind subway and have a droid, would think its freaken awesome. The rest of us exist somewhere between.


is 60 cents a day per phone worth it for you? 20 days to pay off a ten dollar phone and start profiting. if others think that is worth it or not is meaningless.

edit: lol got to love this subreddit. Sorry but its a fact, the question is meaningless. Any business doing cost benefit anaylsis will tell you the same.. the key isnt "worth it".. the key is earnings per..and only then can the Individual decide worth. its not 'worth it' for bill gates to stop and pick up a quarter. The earnings per stoop just isnt there for him.


 




 and what do you call a cow after an abortion....

decalfinated.

ba dum tiss.

yeah dont try to beat a cow at cow jokes, its udderly impossible. :P
 




 Its very hard to think of a situation where the people best at getting legislation passed are best at implementing it. They are a different set of skills.

reminds me of a startalk, where the scientist complained that the last people in the world to come up with budget numbers for projects are scientists... thats not their skill set, their skill set is science not accounting. But time after time again, they get asked, and time after time again, they go over budget. It costs more to have professionals at budgets do it. They think of things like sick days, slow downs due to wrong or misdesigned parts.. and everything under the sun most people dont consider.

We got people good at shit, we need to better use them.

 




 greece has more grounds. It is greece more harmed. Yeha the EU trying to bail out greece and yeah the EU was lied to.. but they could cut greece free.

here in SC, gambling is illegal. if i pay someone to let me gamble, and lose... guess what, crazy as it sounds, i can sue them for 3 times my loses, because its against the law for them to facilitate my  addiction. Its kinda nutty, and i dont know EU law, but i suspect there is good reason for this article to be worded this way.

now sure the state could sue the gambling org.. and probably would fine them, because i gambled away my kids food budget and now need food stamps, but the way its set up.. I'm the one that does the suing.(not a true story by the way.. just an example..the laws are true but I dont gamble or have kids)
 




 there is a ton you can do, but you do know that popular, and respected sites get compromised?

the [new york times got compromised and infected a ton of people.](http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/14/what-to-do-if-you-saw-an-antivirus-pop-up-ad/) .. the perps, actually bought legitimate ads and ran them for a week for a different but real company.. and then changed the ad to the infected one later on.

i guess you stay away from porn, hacking and copyright iffy and crack, cheat sites? You know some of the best places to get attacked are religious sites?


being attentive gets you 90% there. the other 10% sometimes require help.

I fix a ton of peoples computers who will argue with me about that 10%... 'but i never .. ever open emails from people i dont know..." blah blah blah.. what the fuck ever.. you can either listen to me how you got infected or get infected again.(last be of snark directed at stereotypical customer and is mental thoughts.. not trying to be an ass) 




 I think its appropriate to recognize the climate is changing and invest in the proper research to find solutions over the long haul, but not be alarmist about it, Bush tells the paper. Not say end is near, not de-industrialize the country, not create barriers for higher growth, not just totally obliterate family budgets.

Love the right. Want background checks for gun shows and private sellers? You must want to take away all guns and give them to the bloods and crips.


PS putting out house fires, may cause flooding, its a bit unavoidable atm jeb. And jeb only the right see this as a political, left, right issue. If you can solve it with tax cuts, hey I am all ears. Yall just havent offered anything besides 'wait and see.. maybe someone will invent a better way for house  fires and we wont have to flood the place'... well how about we just call the fire department while waiting on einstein.

 




 most these are eh.

instead of adblock get ublock.. reddits newest fav adblocker.. its better on not locking up pages as it blocks ads.

tunnelbear  is ok.. but private internet access is better for a fee based system, there are other free solutions, that arent as good 




 or connection or size of video. i'm guessing your doing it via wifi?

the best is to get some coax.. yeah cable, its faster than cat5 but the routers are expensive.. but you dont really need all that.. you can get cat5 and good nics and should be good.


edit: any of the downvoters want to debate? offer something useful? I have set up a few cable networks in peoples homes, its better for streaming 4k moves. and its better than cat5 which is better than wifi.. you could do cat6 or cat6a if you want. Just saying wifi isnt the best way to stream and most people with 'laptops" are connected wifi. And it probably wasnt the hardware, but the connection. his laptop actually doesnt have to do a lot of processing.. there could be issues with diskspeeds but most his bottleneck would be in the connection for anything high def.

 




 well its the same thing they been doing in everything that costs some corp money.

its not real.

ok its real but nothing we cna do about it.

ok its real and we can do shit about it, but the solutions are too drastic.

er its not really real. and back on the merry go round we go.

 




 actually they will still rise out of poverty. they arent the problem we are.

the 'dial back" is mainly due to you guys saying "just wait".. which you have been saying for decades. It would have been easier to start this in the 90s and ever decade it gets harder.

also you guys said the same thing over so2 and you were wrong then as well. It worked.. we didnt have to wait for magic.. (which by the way.. still hasnt arrived).. it didnt kill society and now statues in the parks melt less. Co2 is bigger and more costly and will be more disruptive than cap and trade of so2.. but really your side has been wrong ever time.

from cfcs, to leaded gas, to addictive cigs..to so2 and now to co2.

and really, yall have denied us into such a worse situation, not sure why anyone would listen to the right for a solution. 'yeah yeah we stopped all progress on this problem for 30 years now.. but hey listen to us for this weak ass, not going to work, just wait for some magical invention idea'


 




 the problem is real, your solutions arent.

Heres one... you know we will never ever ever ever ever ever ever.. have an optical telescope on earth that can resolve cars on a planet in proxima centauri. Billion years from now, i might not even recognize humans. we could be so advanced that even seeing that shit would kill me from awe and yet, we still wont have that telescope.
 
There are just fundamental limits to optics, that no amount of technology will ever change.

Anyways.. some things people might grasp.. as long as the resources are there.. it will always be cheaper and easier to make a drinking glass, than putting one back together after you break it.

its always going to be easier for us to put co2 in the atmosphere than take it out.
 




 its going to be more expensive to take co2 out of the air than it took to put it there..

we have been spending a ton.. you do realise the most depressed people over climate change, are the scientists? You know the people with biggest grasp on what might be accomplishable in garages.

and we been talking about thorium reactors for decades..they sure would help now.. where are my thorium reactors.

and for that matter when the fuck if graphite going to get out of the lab? you know how much money that shits gonna make?


the problem is we need to go ahead and do the solutions we have, cause solutions we may OR MAY NOT.. come up with, are going to take some time to go from paper to saving the fucking planet.


Its really kinda the default safest idea, to assume we are at the limits of knowledge for all sakes and purposes. Not that we are.. but you know a building on fire, and you in a hallway.. its best ot find a door and not wait on someone to invent a teleporter. Yeah we put a fuck ton of money behind making nuclear bombs.. but we bombed the fuck out of the japanese while waiting. That time it worked.. we tend to not talk about the times they didnt, like all the esp crap we threw money at.

if someone magically invents something..better.. hey great, we will weave it into the plan,... and really it helps to go ahead and start.. even for that. Like when we first cap and traded so2 the clean up tech was in its infancy and not the best, when it became an actual market.. then we got some major innovations.



 




 and exponentially so.

and its like that with most things.. we need to really push that. You can drive around on squeaky cv joints rather than have them repacked but in a few months, your going to replace them instead.
 




 and we got most of the time saving basics down.i could use better vaccuum bots, a better mowing one, and a cook,maid bot but after that, techs pretty much got all my hard household hours taken care of. washing machines and plumbing were the big ones. i can add a heater to the seat of my toilet, maybe use fire instead of water(incinerator toilets) but the toilet is mostly done.  transportation.. we can go electric and make them lighter and such.. but besides for drilling massive tunnels in the earth. Planes are the top of the transport pile.. we can tweak.. hit low earth orbit.. jam more people in them. but people waiting on a teleporter got a while wait.


and one of the HARDEST things for people to learn, and disappointing for the scifi kid, is that science has limits. There is no going south of the south pole. Thats it. Done. Finito. A billion years from now, that will be true. We might be sharing thoughts through wires and shit, but Roald Amundsen, in 1911 made it to the south pole and that was the end of that. No one will ever go souther. He never seen a smart phone.. or auto driving cars.. but no one will go further south.(yeah its an overly simplistic example but its a limit people can readily grasp.. where a lot of people seem to think science is the magic of infinity, we can pull anything out of a hat if we dig deep enough.. thats not to say there isnt magic in that hat, but there is a limit to what we can pull out of it)
 




 one the worst problems about climate change is the lag. It takes 40 years for co2 to be fully felt.

Your grandparents helped set the record last year. The record last year was help set by adults in 1974. The emissions we do today will be felt by our grandkids.

It is predicted that every dollar we spend on the problem today(effectively) is $8 we will save in 50 years.(much more when inflation kicks in.. thats in todays money)


jeb and the right want our grand kids to have to spend $8 so we can save a dollar.

and while this is MUCH MUCH worse, these same yahoos said the same shit when we cap and traded SO2 due to acid rain and smog. "you will kill the economy" and "it wont work anyways".. same old head in the same shit. from the same people.. heartland. (who really should be charged with crimes against humanity for their constant denial of science and pushing of fake scientist to prevent policy change.)

The reality. [Cap and trade of so2](http://www.forbes.com/sites/justingerdes/2012/02/13/cap-and-trade-curbed-acid-rain-7-reasons-why-it-can-do-the-same-for-climate-change/) worked better than anyone imagined. And was cheaper than the most optimistic predictions.(ok you can argue we were crap at predictions) But the thing is you dont have to listen to acid rain weather reports much anymore and that shit was getting much worse. But we also created and lead the market for cleaning up factory emissions.

we went from spewing 26 million tons a year, to 5 million.

there wasnt even a recession.. attributed to it.(we had a few in that time space since the 80s but nothing out of the normal)

Its pretty sad but had we had gore.. you know the dude who actually got the most votes and we started on that AGW thing he was so worried about.... This would have been exponentially easier and cheaper than it is today. 




 not really.


and yeah people got to quit thinking science will give them the solution they want, and fucking listen to the solutions science has.

floods suck.. floods suck back, they fuck up houses. You have to get flood insurance. its one of the very worst things that can ever happen to your house..... except when its on fire, and then we flood the shit out of that bitch.

maybe someone in a garage will invent a way to not do this, but if your house is on fire now, i suggest you call a fireman and not wait on the garage hero.

(and yeah we could have space crafts that drop massive house sized candle snuffers,a nd have them land on your home, putting out the fire.. but what people really want, is a switch or a fuse at the pole.. house on fire, flip the switch, fire gone.. lets go have shots at fannys bar) 




 title is misleading only because it is missing the fact it is about past warming events.


change to, "Studies have shown that over the past 3 million years Global sea levels have risen six meters or more, many times, with just slight global warming"

and it would be fine
 




 thats not what its saying..3 million years is just the time frame investigated. The warming and cooling happened many times over that period. And that some of those times, produced sea levels 20 feet higher than today, and this happened when warming increased by 1 to 2 c, which we are already bought into with AGW. (last part after the comma, not in the actual summary i am reading)

 




 People like to talk about how things were made better in the past, but part of the reason, is because they didnt know how crappy they could make stuff. Now we got computers and models, and now we know exactly how fucking thin we can make toilet paper and have it not fall apart until it actually touches your ass. And we havent quite reached the limits yet, a couple years from now, tp will only be a couple atoms thick and you wont be able to even tell you arent wiping your ass with an empty hand. 




 yeah its freaken vegas out there. Thing is the decent companies need to really turn against the not so decent ones.. yeah begging us to whitelist is all and good but still leaves the very reason that drives people to adblock in the first place, costing places like reddit.. who have non intrusive ads to lose money from those who never bother to whitelist.. and reddits losing this money due to douchey websites and their advertisers who dont give much of a shit.


it the net was like reddit, i would uninstall ublock.. there wouldnt be a need. i dont have it because i hate ads particularly. i dont have it for bandwidth, i dont have it to be a dick to developers or try to get 'websites for free"..(i do use it a little as a security tool),  but for the most part the only reason why many of us ever sought out ad blocking was noisy and intrusive ads.. ads that cover content, or make noises at 3am and a little less so for me but still annoying, just animated ads.


hey advertise to me.. i like the content yall provide, just dont be a dick with your ads. An ad that expands to cover content, will make me actually think bad things about the company, whose add i am desperately trying to figure out a way to close.

a bit spun but based on truth.


and its detection rate has been in decline over the years

[Microsoft Security Essentials](http://www.alphr.com/microsoft/microsoft-security-essentials) / Windows Defender review (2015)

though detection rates arent a perfect measure..

So no i would move on. Its ok. its better than nothing, but nah i wouldnt use solely. 

its a bit hard and expensive to keep up an AV. 




 would there be major problems with that? 




 thats was my biggest benefits of cord cutting.

i realized i watched a lot of crap, just cause it was on. Sure some of it i enjoyed, but now the cord is cut, i have zero desire to seek out some of these shows and then i question why i ever watched them in the first place. I did enjoy them, but it was that pointless watching you speak of.
 




 damn it.. i was going to post that.

yeah just saw that the other day.. and when he started to get all graphy.. thought immediately of this sub.

Fucking excellent show. Hes both more optimistic and more pessimistic than the average joe. And man did that dude look so happy riding his bike the first time. lol

well tl;dw the world is better off than most people think, but the future trials are a bit scarier than  a lot  people think.(yeah us on reddit tend to be supportive of AGW science.. and while finally most americans agree it is real.. most give it a low priority) 




 the interesting thing is corps have been doing this for ages to avoid taxes and other things. When they down right own both.
 




 take that /r/til mods

lol

(they deleted the post after it got to front page yesterday.. though i agree it is a better fit for /r/videos as it isnt science and isnt really that learn worthy) 




 from his comment history.. which is a bit full of jizz.

What the fuck are you talking about. Black people are way more racist per capita against white people than white people against blacks. Its just so widely accepted as part of their culture nobody questions it, because if a white person questions some aspect of black culture that doesn't jive well with "polite soceity" its racist.

I think we know what specific group he is talking about. This guy is the same as dylann. A divider and ignorant.

If you look at the actual facts.. [Black people are slightly less racist against whites than whites are against blacks.](http://imediaethics.org/what-the-ap-poll-on-racial-attitudes-really-tells-us-part-1/)

if you look 47% of african americans harbor anti white views, while 59% of white people have anti black views. 


you just wont read this on the council of concerned conservative citizens website.

sorry toss, but your part of the problem that SC needs to recover from.. does there need to be recovery on both sides? fuck yeah, but you sir need some self reflection.
 




 THE REASON THIS ONE FLAG WAS PUT UP WAS RACISM.. dance around it all you want. Doesnt matter how you feel. THE REASON... the INTENT... THE MOTIVE.. was racism.

If i shoot you and happen to take out a tumor before it gets out of control, that doesnt make me a surgeon, even if the results are the same. My intent was to kill. That might have been a historical artifact, but it was abused by bigots who raised that flag in bigotry. Doesnt matter the bullet took out the cancer.. doesnt make bullets a cure or the shooter a doctor and same with the flag.  The intent, the motivation, wasnt historic, it was bigoted.

 




 yeah sorry you cry history all you want, but you cant ignore the parts you dont like. It was put up specifically for racist reasons. you might have a point, if the south constantly tried to honor the confederacy and people constantly tried to stop them. But it wasnt.. it was put up to fight segregation. 

What you should be pissed at, is that people took a piece of your revered history and besmirched it with racism. Yall should be pissed that it was so abused by the klan and others, specifically to tell black people "THIS AINT YOUR LAND AND DONT GET UPPIDY'. dont be mad at those offended by it now.. when it was totally used for offensive reasons AND NOT AT ALL.. NOT IN ONE IOTA was that put there for any honoring of the civil war or the people who died in it. Not in the least.  




 he was friends with the jailers... which OFTEN happens. i mean we just had a high profile escape due to people becoming friends with the jailers. 

I get the idea, but his shaking hands wasnt some noble gesture in the face of hate. No he shook a friends hands, who was happy his friend was finally released from jail.

I agree with your concepts.. and treating each other with respect.

but

Yes, this flag is arguably symbolic of suffering on both sides past and present nevertheless it's end should have been treated with respect because it's everyone's history. American History.

NOPE

and hate to go to the most relevant example... once again, the nazi flag deserves no respect, even if it is ALL german peoples history. Nor would a polio infested blanket, which is also our history.

No one has to respect that flag. Sorry. Doesnt matter if it is our history. You cant scream to black people "treat it with respect and reverence cause its all our history"

They allowed to be pissed, just like others are allowed to feel reverence. the big problem is when the gov decides whats the default way you should feel.

would it be better for healing for people to be a bit more toned down.. keep some of their jeers to themselves sure. Totally agree. But the respect and the mandela thing, not so much. (totally support mandela but the story of the jailer thing is just spin)
 




 But as for the real-time Brainet sharing of complex information, personal ideas, and emotional experiences between people? Experts think society wouldnt want it, even if it were technologically possible.

I wouldn't be so quick to say that. A small bit of the population both the foolish and explorers would do this and if it offered unique benefit, it would spread. Also i would think they are judging their distaste, from a point of view of society as it is now. If we get many other brain interfaces, that help more than the handicapped, the next leap, combining brains might not seem so outlandish, maybe even to some of these unnamed experts. And just considering the possibilities for science, from minds being able to share thoughts and concepts without the labor of describing them, i would suspect some governments might experiment with this even if they dont have willing participants.

i wonder what happens to the memories, especially when split up.
 




 I couldnt take it anymore, i give up, i just went ahead and sent the nsa a picture of my penis. I give up trying to keep it hidden, they can have it. 




 thank god this wasnt a pair of scissors in need of a pair of scissors. 




 the best i can conjecture..

No misleading claims. Posts that omit essential information, or present unrelated facts in a way that suggest a connection will be removed.

not that he was suggesting this is science, or mislead, but my guess is they removed for the "suggestion" that this would happen all the time with men versus women rather than this particular group, without the scientific backing of such a statement.


so basically his til was "there was a cool episode to this show".. i'm a bit on the fence of the removal as many found it interesting but i guess i can see where they think the title is suggestive of a truism when its not really misleading beyond people ignorant on how science works. 




 so it sounds like you put a little too much thought into this already. Should we be scared? and where is your lair?


you know a scientist not hell bent on world domination would probably say "you know we never thought about it before.. i mean why would anyone bring back such a killing machine, we arent over populated with whales"

i got my eye on you jack. 




 well wouldnt the next question be if you gave someone like me with zero skills, a basketball and told me to practice shooting hoops for 30 minutes a day.. i mean did they just prove that learning, and in this case with hand eye coordination.. increases brain volume. And does it equate to actual usefulness? there could be arguments about some of the eye hand skills and their uses in certain jobs.. but what if we tried to find the most useless set of movements.. have people practice trying to wiggle their ears. there's not to man jobs out there what would require an exceptional expertise in ear wiggling but i suspect we might see similar growths.. some not, as mario obviously has more kinds of skills involved.
 




 yeah it just fits the definition.. but i have never seen it used in terms of a criminal spilling the beans on co-criminals. heck people call for 'whistleblower protections", i'm pretty sure they arent thinking criminals who just want a lighter sentence. Maybe some, but.. most are thinking of insiders like snowden doing the right thing.

it was however invented by ralph nader cause he thought 'snitch' sounded bad. And [not a lawyer but sounds like by legal definition it does look like even criminals count.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower#United_States) 




 Really in my perfect world the government is generic. I dont even like speciality plates. It's just asking for trouble. People might not like this, but in my perfect world, the cool stunt Obama did wouldn't have been right either. Its a divisive issue, and while i think the right side won, its not up to government but society to rub their noses in it. Still we have christmas shit all over in the holidays, and other crap we do, so I cant raise too much objection to what Obama did. and it was a cool burn.  But really even if individuals in government support views, the actual government should be seen as an unbiased entity.  It's not and won't be any time soon but one can dream.

 




 yeah i searched all over for that quote.. embiggened the text and all and then watched the video and sighed.

He was definitely in the wrong. 100% supporter of gay rights, but i like my government to be cold hard generic, and they tend not to be already but in the other direction.  They have no business promoting any point of view.

and i could see someone saying that, but i would like to hear it for myself, or see the quote, most likely if it did happen, they were just being a snarky ass. But to me it just sounded like he was belittling the complaint, when the town had a very reasonable objection... for a change.

and no it dont exist anymore 




 but that would get less clicks. 




  Triceratops could put its head down and point its brow horns at another animal, making the frill stand up. This made Triceratops appear larger.

and in this case, looks to me like it could be mistaken for a big gaping mouth. With slightly bad vision, it would sorta look like something with giant canines and a mouth full of teeth, that could bite on a much larger animal.(total conjecture, but without my glasses thats what it would look like to me) scary either way.
 




 I love the awe on the face of that one woman right before she talks about the place being orderly. 




 I really hate that when that happens, he's lucky he can afford to move to the bahamas but what are the rest of us to do. 




 I say this a lot but it doesnt cease to be true, the whole set up of reddit negates most needs for mods. The only true need i see, is illegal activity(porn or scam links), spam and personal info.

Other than that, the down vote, is supposed to be solely for community moderation. And though it is more used for disagreement, the actual purpose, if you read reddiquette is only for  comments and posts that dont foster discussion and not ones you disagree with. Even reposts are fine, different title verbiage, or w/e.

the whole point is the community decides what to see.

I get that will sometimes lead to subreddits, that arent posting things in the ways you like, like /r/games versus /r/gaming. And its not horrible when there is a massive community split so each can have their own but even then the communities should be mostly drive by self moderation. yeah we can suck at it at times but mostly we dont, and thats the price you pay for the usefulness of reddit.


some of the very point was to get away from editorial controls. A minority of people telling us what we should consider important and allowing us to decide that ourselves. Reddits kinda reverting into a problem it was designed to solve. 




 Its such a beneficial adaptation to recognize the calls of other species and you see it so much on land, and many whales have such wide ranges of hearing frequencies, it would be hard to believe that its not extremely likely that most whales would recognize certain sounds from other species, be it threats, or similar foods. this is askscience and science doesnt care about feelings but it feels like it almost has to arise in creatures with hearing, as the first ones that do it, can eat more, and die less, which is a hallmark of survival. And I dont know the science of it in us or really much more than the basics on evolution, but it seems like we instinctively recognize a lot of sounds animals make. especially when it comes to threat or hurt sounds. First time i heard a gator hiss at me, i knew it was mad. you dont really need to learn the sound cats make when they are fighting. and they tend to be similar, most hurt sounds seem higher pitched. and i know my dog would react to the sounds of cats fighting and you use hurt animal sounds to lure in preying animals. Well i guess the question for me then is, are there hearing land animals we know of that dont react to the calls of other species 




 True, but i'm not sure how much the endurance would help if we couldn't track and kill our prey. Our noses arent the best. 




 Thats a [different wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoconservatism)

necons are the military wing of the GOP that believe in imposing democracy

Neoconservatives frequently advocate the promotion of democracy and promotion of American national interest in international affairs, including by means of military force, and are known for espousing disdain for communism and for political radicalism

and

While neoconservatism is concerned primarily with foreign policy, there is also some discussion of internal economic policies. Neoconservatism generally endorses free markets and capitalism, favoring supply-side economics, but it has several disagreements with classical liberalism and fiscal conservatism: Irving Kristol states that neocons are more relaxed about budget deficits and tend to reject the Hayekian notion that the growth of government influence on society and public welfare is "the road to serfdom."

The wing you describe is the supply side economics or the [neoliberals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism)(yeah hate that term).

The gop is a coalition of the social conservatives, the neocons and the neoliberals. 




 well its wrong on so many levels. even when they tried to backtrack and say it was about obamas part time economy.

Economies dont even work that way.

The kid at mcdonalds can probably cook more burgers, there is probably room there for him to be a little more productive. Or you know we can make a machine that spits one out a second... but that will just put the store out of business.

demand drives economies. 

And I really hate how they always word the productivity thing, for the most part, its code for jobs going away. more things done by less people. Needing less man hours to build a car. Its kinda the point, so when they talk about increased productivity they mean the   business will have less job openings... really if his goal is "employment" and more hours, the last thing we want is to be more productive.. no you want to be less.  So it takes more humans to satisfy demands(and yeah you can go too far, i'm talking about still meeting demand in the same time, just with more people)

Its so incredibly wrong.  




 It is quite ridiculous that the end user has ever been treated as a criminal..... well, that is if you think the goals is to get them off drugs.
 




 Could be the first step in a changing attitude in religious circles on how to combat the "ills" of our society. Instead of punishment, help your fellow man with compassion.

UM, hate to break it to you, what you percieve as "changing attitude", is simply the difference between the left wing religious and the right. The right is authoritarian, fire and brim stone and more about punishment and penance and many believe suffering is a path to heaven, while the left is more about lead by example, and is more about compassion. Its like the last pope versus this one. One was more concerned with gay marriage and abortion and people doing wrong, and the other is more concerned with helping the poor, global warming and toning down the hate.

its not changing attitudes, though they do shift some, its as old as the church itself, one side wants to beat heaven into you and the other side wants to lead you there.


[religious conservatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism#Religious_conservatism)

In most modern democracies, political conservatism seeks to uphold traditional family structures and social values. Religious conservatives typically oppose abortion, homosexual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of marriage. 

[Progressive Christianity ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Christianity)

Progressive Christianity is a form of Christianity which is characterized by a willingness to question tradition, acceptance of human diversity, a strong emphasis on social justice and care for the poor and the oppressed, and environmental stewardship of the Earth. Progressive Christians have a deep belief in the centrality of the instruction to "love one another"

one focuses on the care for the poor stuff, the other focuses on the "rules" 




  One thing, they never seemed to ever teach in english class, was that you should design titles to mislead. I always foolishly thought that the title should sorta be a summary of sorts.

And not to be pedantic but whistleblower is one word and while technically correct, colloquially whistleblowers tend to be people who expose wrong-doing before getting caught, while informants, tend to be the ones that do it after. Though It still can be used here, i think eventually it will cease to be correct.

 




 same as others ios runs fine, have to restart droids. 




 i wont tell you the odds, but maybe i should about video splicing? still one of the better fakes out there.(er entertainment value wise.. unlike the one where the guy is tossing cds into players and shit) 
 




 Well, bad guys tend to be harder to catch if they dont wear that stupid burglars mask all the time.

To belabour a point, I would never fart and blame it on someone else, them people are sick, they are like the worst people in the world, who would even do that and dont listen to those other people saying i do that sort of thing, cause thats just wrong. i'm totally against that sort of thing.

Btw i think allie totally just farted right now, wasnt me, i never even had gas.
 




 The lag of global warming is an insidious truth. It takes decades for the full effect of emissions to come to fruition. The record warmth we have today, was mostly caused by emissions of your parents and grandparents.. back at a time when there was less cars, and we used a lot less electricity. 

its estimated to take about 40 years, between emissions and effects. Many of you werent even born. I was shooting a cap gun when the emissions went into our atmosphere that helped push the record of 2014. the world pop was 4 billion, now it is 7.3. The emissions from you will be felt by your grandkids. And a lot of you dont even have kids yet.

and you really got to consider the growth.. 2 decades ago, china hardly had much of a car market, they wll road bikes, now its the largest auto market on the planet.

in unconscionable the world we are asking our kids to live in. Yes we are going to have to eat some bitter pills, and as respectable adults, thats what we got to do. Our kids are already going to have to eat worse ones. we need to make sure they are as easy to swallow as possible.

But people really need to be cognisant of that 40 years, stop all emissions today and we still got nearly a half century of this. the emissions from my driving today will be felt in 2055. RN its all relatively minor, there is sea level rise, islands starting to have trouble, glaciers retreating, some corals are starting to struggle and permafrost melting screwing up roads in alaska.. project that over 40 years. [This pict shows 17 years](http://www.effectofglobalwarming.com/images/global-warming-pictures5.jpg)  and know our emission rate grows.. every year more than the last. We need to step up and be the adults we profess to be.
 




 well a lot of it has to do with reporting and its not quite like how you say.

 you can make statements like, 20 years ago, we cna stop this, if we start now.. and 10 years ago, repeat the same statement and not be in conflict.. the difference being how much of cuts needed in how short of a time

and a lot are saying "we will be less fucked if we start now'.. rather than we can fix this.

 




 nah it isnt a waste and they will continue to spend like this and you have to in a rationing position. you cant just take the price of the product, because the price is invalid due to rationing which allows everyone a share. The crime is less the theft of water and more teh violation of rationing put there for public good.

if your all crashed on an island with a single box of crackers and one dude eats them all.. he ate more than the $2 they cost.
 




 

 its a bit different when its a limited resource, the value obviously isnt sold at what the market would bear, hence the rationing.

its more like stealing during a natural disaster like a hurricane.. except california's been on going for years. So yeah they will spend more than the value of the theft as the value of the crime is much larger.


 




 ok fair enough didnt know it was 2:30 in the afternoon. And yeah families saw them but in my experience they can be out quite late with kids on vacation,  and didnt equate that to mean day time sex on a crowded beach, though i still would like to know what exactly they were doing.
 




 ok when i search for these apps via the ply store i get a different page.. same looking app, just a lot more downloads.. are there special perk differences to the ones in the links versus the ones you find searching?

edit never mind yeah they perk . 




  which is that it is going to automate a lot of jobs that we thought would be "safe" until recently,


unfortunately politician isnt one of them jobs that will be replaced any time soon.
 




 land of the free.. get over it, humans have sex. and if you lived near a beach, you have had sex on the beach and found out it kinda sucks, but growing up on a beach, i dont know anyone who hasnt.
 









 a few reasons

1. cause well oil is more than handy.. its solar power in concentrated form, put down after hundreds of thousands of years of sunshine.(yeah i know what its made of, but ultimately it all comes from the sun) even with oil money, its not going to be that easy. 

2. your asking them to admit that their main focus is harming the planet, and do things to harm the bottom line of their main money maker. "our shit is fucking up the place but dont worry we are researching in ways to not fuck up the place"


3. dinosaurs are slow to move, just ask block buster. They no longer like high risk adventures. They did that, they succeeded and now they are a mega corp.. high risk adventures are better for smaller corps which often go under when they dont succeed, we only talk about the ones that do. Not a total truism but an extremely strong rule of thumb. The nature of the corp resists change. you get everything set up working, you kinda want to leave it that way until forced. look at bandwidth.. why give us more until someone moves in next store to force them to give us more. 

and just because you are first to market, doesnt mean you will own that market

could they have sure.. and believe it or not, they are.. they didnt do a manhattan like project to bring us electric cars and thorium reactors but even if they had there is no guarantee that they would have been successful.. there is good reasons why GOVERNMENTS are some of the best pioneers in the most high risk adventures.
 




 and another rule of thumb.. corps dont give a fuck if they kill people as long as the money comes in. And they will often fight tooth and nail to be able to continue to kill people as long as the money still flows in and this is one of the many reasons why corps shouldnt be allowed to influence elections.


seriously how many fucking times does history need to repeat itself. 


and you know we didnt ban its sale? right? we just said they couldnt sell it in the US, but we let them sell it and still sell it, to foriegn countries.. mainly third world countries. And gave nascar an exception until just a few years ago when they switched. This despite, the science is diamond hard and the fact we all share the same atmosphere. and besides the the equatorial split, the atmosphere gases mix  and spread fairly quickly.


and really.. heartland institute, should be before the hague.. they are the one stop shop for denial scientists in everything.. from leaded gas, to cfcs, to cigs, to global warming.. to fracking fluids.. you need someone to deny hard science, thats where you go

PS.. [that dude who discovered lead stopped gas knocking.... ALSO unfortunately, gave us CFCs as well. Smart man but.. damn his discoveries.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley,_Jr.)

but seriously we need to push back AND CRIMINAL CHARGE corps and think tanks that knowingly distort the science that is actively harming people, for profits.
 




 I still contend that most dont worship any book or words or gods, they worship themselves.

if you look at the loudest christians, who love these monuments.. they tend to be a bit right wing. They have no problem with people working sundays, in fact  on christian republican wanted to get rid of weekend rules. Honor thy father and mother? not if they want to retire.. another christian said there shouldnt be retirement because noah worked til he was 600. Thou shall not kill? well unless its for nation building or the government killing criminals.. but god damn that same government if it pays a dime for an abortion.. how does that even work?(yeah i get the "their day in court' crap but the ten commandments seem to be missing that caveat)

adultry they dont like, but are very very very quick to forgive if the person has an R on their sleeve and a cross around their neck. 

many 'good christians" went to defend that bundy guy who was stealing from us, by not paying grazing fees like everyone else was.


bearing false witness? you can do that against dems(chill right wingers, its just the right wing version of christianity is a bit louder and you know it.. same people used to be left wingers, we didnt want them) and other countries apparently.

looking for gay marriage on there... or the part where god meant to keep the races separate so he put them on different landmasses, so no desegregation or interracial marriage, but slavery is ok.(this isnt past crap.. nearly [50% of missouri republicans want to ban mixed marriages](http://www.thewire.com/national/2011/04/mississippi-republicans/36455/))


nah they worship themselves. I follow the instructions better to build a fucking swing set for the kids than they do their instructions for ever lasting life. but see i actually believed in the swing set.. that when i was done, i would have something for my kids to play on. Its not possible for them to really believe in the bible if they dont follow it.

 




 well its possible to have a monument to those things without being in violation..... The whole point was to not worship people or objects that god is in all things and you dont have to travel to any monument to have a conversation with him,. To worship the message, not the man or the object. It depends how its treated.. thou i suspect many might treat this more than a historical artifact or a biblical message.. both of which would be ok as long as you dont treat it as divine. (but yeah christianity is chuck full of graven images)

now of course, they ignore most of those commandments anyways... especially bearing false witness and working on the sabbath(if you can get the abrahamics to even agree what day that is)

and they are in multiple [violations of the flag code](http://www.ushistory.org/betsy/flagcode.htm).. but no one ever gives a shit about that.


unless it is mirrored, the stars got to be on the other side. its not supposed to have an eagle on it no matter how cool that looks and not to be used to advertise or promote anything but the US. 




 i wonder how the movies will play out 20 years from now. what's he going to be, a youtube reporter? and then 40 years from now hes fucked, no one will need glasses. 




 [this quote from mark twain has always stuck with me](http://www.twainquotes.com/Spelling.html)... especially since i enjoy butchering the language, I find it quite inciteful. :)  It is about spelling, though i suspect the same can be said for some grammar issues.

I don't see any use in having a uniform and arbitrary way of spelling words. We might as well make all clothes alike and cook all dishes alike. Sameness is tiresome; variety is pleasing. I have a correspondent whose letters are always a refreshment to me, there is such a breezy unfettered originality about his orthography. He always spells Kow with a large K. Now that is just as good as to spell it with a small one. It is better. It gives the imagination a broader field, a wider scope. It suggests to the mind a grand, vague, impressive new kind of a cow.

the way we write when wrelaxed, do give insights to people character. 

lol and yes i am completely retarded but life is more enjoyable thus so.
 




 it would just be Bruce Wayne with a reporter pass.

your forgetting the glasses and they are the key to the disguise.
 




 another aspect of the PCE which wasnt stated, is it the one that does the substitution crap. meaning when things get priced out of peoples ranges they switch to something more in their range. So while your grocery bill might not rise as much, the food you are eating is getting to be worse quality or desirability.

So when you substitute the maxwell house for the clear value brand, it doesnt count as "inflation" as long as the price you now pay for generic is the same as the price you used to pay for premium.


and yeah there are good arguments and good reasons to use this.. depending on what you want to show. like  how much of a percent of income they are spending on food.. that doesnt really matter so much the  substitutions. you just want total bill.

but when we are talking about flat wages, I think most of us think of quality of life compared to the past. Can i afford the same as my parents and then i really think you need to take into account the changes people have made, just to be able to survive.. me switching from nicer more expensive breads to cheap ass bread.. doesnt mean i am doing just as well as my parents did. even if my cheap ass bread cost the same as their nicer breads used to.


but yeha cpi has its issues, because some things do rise in price that has nothing to do with inflation per say but things like depleting resources and like it or not some things like gas will rise faster than pay even in a equal wage growth society.

last even if you just accept the articles outlooks, there is still arguments to be made about income inequality, even if "it isnt as bad as stated" we are a society and america is actually twice as rich as it was in 1968 adjusted per capita and for inflation. All businesses and workers have helped make this so and before this time, the growths in income were more equal and well slowly sizeable portions of this country have lost the benefits of living in a country with such a growing economy. and yes this is a different separate part of the debate, on if meager growth is good enough, or should we all have a more equal share of growth like we used to when unions were strong.

also looking at the median is better than average and all but still doesnt tell the whole story, the problem gets worse the lower the brackets you go.. and the lowest bracket actually ads a cost to all of us as they tend to need government help and are less likely to get this job provided insurance.. and if we want a complete picture, you got to take this into account that the most expensive bracket tax wise, is the one with the least wage growth over time.
 




 i had the pass, the pass wasnt on mirror, it fell on dash. Caught cop giving ticket, showed him pass, he gave ticket anyways. In court cop said he didnt think i was disabled, and that i should get the ticket anyways. The judge said i had the right to park there. It was over 20 years ago. The cop was probably arguing i should get the ticket due to not proper display of the pass, but all i heard was him saying he didnt even think i was handicapped. but I DID show him the pass when gettting ticket. and of course it was a campus cop. But they are real cops. And actually here, they have a wide jurisdiction.

either way believe it or not, dont care, that part isnt really pertinent to the story. Just an addition to the concept that people will give you shit if they dont think you need it, when you can actually need it.
 




 its also an infamous [NP hard problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hard).. like mail routes.

which yeah you covered a little with 'available runways and air traffic' but the point is, its far more complex and hard to do than people imagine and really it can be hard to grasp how hard it is until you actually try to do it.


well scroll through this on air traffic control and they talk about the [np-hardness but you will see a lot of math most of you dont want to do.](http://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/papers/AirTransportation/The%20air%20traffic%20flow%20management%20problem%20with%20enroute%20capacities.pdf)(warning pdf) 




 well.. ok we know the entitled are out there but here is my story.

I was run over by a drunk driver but i could walk afterwards.. what i couldnt do, was walk and carry a lot and long distances gave me a lot of trouble. My doc gave me a handicap pass, while in physical therapy.. that i ONLY ever used for school. Grocery store i can push a cart.. but a backpack full of books all the way from student parking.. that was a bitch much. 

but i would get a lot of hell for getting out of my car at a handicap space and walking. a cop actually gave me a ticket despite the pass because "you werent really handicapped".. the judge threw it out.

anyways, had i had to go to say an amusement park with family at that time, i probably would have gotten a scooter. Not to be an entitled lazy dick.. but it fucking hurt to walk long distances and keep up with family

I wouldnt have done like these ladies, i was very self concious about it all but just saying just cause they rented them, doesnt mean they didnt NEED them. especially in a crowded venue, where the walk might have been long to get to where they are.


edit: as for entitled, just remembered this tidbit,  steve jobs famously thought of handicapped parking as "premium parking" that you paid for later.(which is one reason we got to get progressive in fines)
 




 and we hooked our vote to a network.. sigh.


at least the gov going back to paper when they list all the mental issues of people in government.. a bit late, but still, its a bit harder to hack paper.
 




 ["jap" is generally seen a derogatory.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jap)

Jap is an English abbreviation of the word "Japanese." Today it is generally regarded as an ethnic slur among Japanese minority populations in other countries, although English-speaking countries differ in the degree to which they consider the term offensive. In the United States, Japanese Americans have come to find the term controversial or offensive, even when used as an abbreviation.[1] In the past, Jap was not considered primarily offensive; however, during and after the events of World War II, the term became derogatory

so if the search terms were combined, pearl harbor and jap, it actually sorta re-enforces it, since thats when it became derogatory.  Not that the searchers meant it that way.. you can say derogatory things out of ignorance and not from hate and people often do.


just like ["jew"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews)

It is widely recognized that the attributive use of the noun Jew, in phrases such as Jew lawyer or Jew ethics, is both vulgar and highly offensive. In such contexts Jewish is the only acceptable possibility

though i think people are forgetting the racism behind these terms.





 




 you just need a square can.. you will find the paper bags are infinitely better for trash.................. as long as they dont get wet. Ok they tend to get wet a lot, but they can hold a fuck ton of pointy trash without breaking.
 




 yep sorry but this is one of those weird times, when the markets and green ideas followed the same paths for no other reason than money. And you can still get paper in some areas. mainly where richer people demand them.

also the reason plastic bags are so fucking crappy, isnt due to recycled materials, but.. "HEY lets see how little of this plastic shit we can get away with" and thats why you have to double bag if you have anything at all heavier than a nanner in them.

yeah its all about money.

Along with this plastic ban, cali is charging a paper bag tax.. fee w/e, to try to encourage stores to go 100% reusable and not just go 100% back to paper. Though most WILL at first.


 




 these bags are made from recycled dog poop.  you can mail your dog's in and get free bags.
 




  Does this mean I can stop buying sugar?

oh for sure, shits good. You can even train ants to move them bastards around to the sweetest parts of the tree.

of course, you kinda want to eat this bug shit before you go all wrath of god on them. Gods wrath will kill anything in its way, so dont get mistaken for an aphid.

as for your car, i guess you could join peta, fight for aphid personhood and then sue them bastards for car cleaning bills.  




 they shit sugar. "[honeydew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeydew_(secretion\))"

neem oil can help if you want to be green.

systemic insecticide tends to be better if you just want to lay down the wrath of god.


and yeah [aphids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphid) for sure.

 




 Stop oppressing me. 




 we have before.  It my hometown we changed lighting laws, for the loggerhead turtles and have contributed to a lot of their recovery. Some people were already turning off their lights during the egg laying season but a lot werent. SO government had to tell them to stop and now things are improving.

unfortunately when its cheaper to ignore change, it takes government to force it because a portion of the population wont change. Plus you cant expect the public to be experts in all things, which is why we hope the governments listen to those who are the experts and make the wisest decisions based on the information at hand. The biggest problem is when governments have corrupting influences, that encourage the humans in government to make decisions based on personal gain rather than based on the facts.

though the public can be corrupting in themselves if we vote out people that make the hard and wise changes that we dont like. 




 well recycling mainly started for landfill and different pollution reasons. Emissions is a totally different problem.

We have had improvements. WE cap and traded SO2 and it was more successful than ever dreamed. WE have greatly reduced our lead emissions and there is decent evidence it caused a drop in our violent crime rate. We have made progress on  the ozone hole.  And through various environmental laws and sheer human effort, we have saved many species from almost certain extinction and have even managed to remove some from the endangered species list, though we tend to add more than we remove, there have been a ton of environmental successes and perhaps we do need to do a better job at advertising those facts.
 




 "no return" isnt really the best phrase. What people mean is we are going to suffer bad effects and not a lot we can do about it but the earth has had higher ppm of co2 and one day can eventually have lower amounts than we do today. I mean there is a return, but we are going to have to travel over some hellish roads, for a very very very very long time, to get there.
 




 well ultimately the intelligent beneficial ruler is the best system, its just not easily achieved. 




 it does appear that we  have an [ increasingly bad extinction rate](http://news.sciencemag.org/2011/03/are-we-middle-sixth-mass-extinction)

and this article does have a link and a quote suggesting the worst extinction this planet has seen was caused by acidic oceans.

However i dont see anything in the article or the paper summary that supports the part of the title before the word alarming. They dont even seem to even try to tie any current extinctions to a change in ocean acidity. The summary does say warm water corals are already being 'affected'  and that under the strictest reductions concidered, they will still be under high risk for extinction but dont attribute any extinctions to modern acidification(not denying that might be happening but it doesnt appear like this paper addresses that). It does suggest we are at risk for extinctions in all reductions scenarios and that business as usual would leave us at high to very high risk of mass extinctions within 85 years. Which is a scary short time frame.

I do wish we could edit titles without deleting the submission, especially in subreddits like this. With the political climate, it can be very damaging to not be as accurate as possible in our claims.
 
 




 well some in the GOP have suggested that NASA do less "earth studies".. meaning AGW 




 what gets me is that anyone talks to him anymore.. And its kinda bizarre that he got so far in the field of science(even if just astronomy and not biology), that he can still lack healthy scientific skepticism.(and that doesnt mean denial, that means demanding proof and scientific rigors and not just accepting the bs that he seems to spew) and he does real science from time to time... i know a lot of scientists have trouble separating themselves from personal beliefs, heck even einstein had troubles with that, but he is just above and beyond most others when it comes to jumping to conclusions due to his desires for things to be true. its like he skipped his freshmen year but still managed to graduate with honors without the benefits of knowing the basics. Its down right bizarre. Its like he can do calculus without knowing addition. or really more like those people who scan mars rover photos and cry alien at ever rock they think is shaped like a statue., as if you cant see the same thing all over this planet that had nothing but natural origins. i got a tree with a face across the street. No aliens involved.. just some wounds and cancer.


 




 yeah aint no way it couldnt be.. shit takes a second to dry and its too obvious due to the design. 




 i guess that should be owned, but horses can be driven or rode, so i guess it dont matter... still a bit hung over 




 A horse of course. We are finally perfecting the mechanical horse.

a little late for independance day but i was drunk off my ass just like the founding fathers. 




 Everything she has now, the dragons, the army, they all seem like they sort of just fell into her lap. 

fell into her lap? you mean how she was pretty much sold as a slave, husband killed by a witch, and then she threw herself into a fire?  you have an interesting definition of "fell".. yeha only she could have done that and by blood she had all this coming to her, but "fall into your lap" is normally crap that is just given to you and like it or not, she did put a bit of effort into it. Not sure how many people would jump into a fire.. not even knowing you would get dragons for it.. maybe you jump into fires all the time.. idk.

its less shes self entitled, but thrown into a leadership roll when just a little while ago, she was a terrified little girl and she really doesnt know shit about how the world worked and she is feeling her way out. I suspect you thrown in this situation might find it a bit hard to deal with as well... even with some slightly unruly dragons at your side. She never asked for any of this. She never wanted it. HER BROTHER WANTED THE EVER LIVING SHIT OUT OF IT. And no matter how shes tries to be, strong, weak, fair.. shit tends to have a lot of fuck ups.

tl;dr give the girl a break, and think about what she has been through and know she didnt seek any of this.. it wasnt thrown into her lap, it was forced onto her.
 




 your body is not an explosive launch device, not from the head, dick or butt, or any part of your body. 




 shhhhhhh

cant blame the banks in the least.. dont you know that. See it was the worlds poor and middle class who all at the same time decides without any help from the banks to all be irresponsible at the same time.. and please dont look at the laws the banks lobbied for. Must blame the POOR.. they are 10000% at fault for destroying the worlds economy.
 




 he doesnt want to blame the banks at all.

just like the right in the us.

please ignore we  in the US had laws on the books that would have prevented those shitty loans to people with bad credit... and NO the government didnt force them,  on the contrary, the banks spent big money buying politicians willing to get rid of those laws, because banks, make bank, loaning to the poor.. especially those who care barely pay and are frequently late. And here in the US we bailed out the banks, AND Demanded that we give no rules on using tax payer money on bonuses, while at the same time, demanding autoworkers take a paycut before they get bailed out. Basically we only asked the poor and middle class to tighten their belts while the big banks already enjoying negative interests rates(do to inflation).. read free money got to play with tax payer money to shore up their accounts. Please ignore they knew exactly what they were doing, as they sold the same products short out the back door while pushing them onto our retirement funds and communities investments.

BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DONT GIVE THE BANKS A SINGLE BIT OF BLAME.
 




 well except they announced they had several people to take over her position.

I'm not taking reddits side.. but they do have people to take over the AMA stuff.

and I do agree with shabinka, that we would be taken more seriously if we didnt immediately go to hitler.
 




 this guy sounds like he  needs a tar and feathering.. /s

when reddit gets in tar and feather mode, even for legit reasons... its best to just stay out their way.
 




 really? I have gotten ones  but its rare, never twice in a row or anything... the most i have gotten is 8.. normally i get 4. Its one of the better apps for points for me.. just its a pain in the ass a bit.
 




 do you have a screen shot? i dont see it 




  Ban members who don't disclose but heavily evangelize all things Perk, 24/7? I'm not talking about people who like Perk - many do - but obvious paid shills?

I ask again.. how can you tell the difference?

I use perk.. like most of yall.

I like my amazon cards.

I attacked peopel who said stupid shit like watching only app trailers get you banned.

does that make me a shill? according to some here it does.


and who the fuck cares? there is just as many of people who hate perk irrationally as people who are likely paid shills.

well put it this way.. what do you think paid shills accomplish in this subreddit?

its not like they are adverting to many non perk users. Most of us came here after discovering perk on /r/beermoney 




 the "moderation" these people want.. is to ban anyone who doesnt say perk is hitler on a daily basis.

it doesnt matter if you dont promote perk.. if you dont agree with any of their witch hunts.. you got to go.
 




 for the most part they will run.. doesnt matter time of day.. if you jump on them or they cant see you, they can attack, but generally they dont like the taste of humans. They are more dangerous at dusk but by far most get bit here fucking with them, actually jumping on them in the water, or being too close to a nest and not listening to the hissing warning the mother gives. Notice they say "almost immediately yelled for help.. he prolly jumped on one.

now crocs.. they wil fuck you up. they are the wasps of the gator looking world.


and yeah they absolutely love marshmellows. I grew up with them, caught them.. friends had them as pets, swam with them, been chased by them.. they get in your pool sometimes. Never seen anyone hurt that wasnt fucking with them or landed on one. 




 how do you even know?

My problem with this thread, is sometimes I DISAGREE with the witch hunts. No I am not a premium and yes perk can suck balls, but so can the kids in this subreddit who pull out the pitchforks for anything and everything, real or not. And I fear this cries of premium users will just be used to say "no i am not being unreasonable or stupid.. its just premiums downvoting me"


For example, for a while in the start people were screaming that you got banned if you only watched app trailers. It even became part of hte faq.. dont just watch app trailers or get banned. IT WAS TOTAL BULLSHIT.. but try to explain that at that time and you would have been downvoted into oblivion. We had a similar thing happen recently where suddenly people thought you would get banned from perk pop quiz if you turned on lightning mode and left it unattended. THIS IS ALSO BS.. if they wanted to stop that all they needed was a next button after a set of questions. ITs not hard. it wouldnt cost a lot of money or programming.. its like 3 fucking lines in java.

I still use perk.. i still enjoy the cards, yess i get less than i used to but they are still the best beer money app right now for people who want totally passive earnings. and no i am not a preium saying how fucking awesome they are.. thats just a fact.

edit figured on the downvotes.. teh age range of this subreddit is so retarded. sorry if i dont say perk is hitler on a daily basis.
 




 i suspect it means they are the ones that get to play with beta crap. They might get broken upgrades before the rest of us.

I do suspect, though they said no, but then deleted it, that they might get a little more points per videos in helping them with their beta shit.

Thats the only thing i can guess their premium crap can possibly mean. That instead of having a new beta program when ever they have something like perk plastik, they have a group of beta users already ready. It just makes their lives easier, since signing people up for beta programs, does take time and normally humans. By doing it only once. with perk premium.. they can save them humans to give bullshit answers to CS inquiries
 




 videos?

unlock and win, has no videos that i know of.. just the static ads.

it should not come up with you are watching a video in another app.

IT IS sometimes slow to come up from unlocking a slow phone.

but it has no videos.
 




 and see these things have a negative effect.

1. this man is less likely to help the police if he hears something in the community, because he doesnt trust the police.

2. terrorists in the community now have more ammo to recruit with, when they tell young confused Arab youth, that the west is bigoted against them and their religion.

 




 none of his previous felonies were due to violence.

if he was an american he would have been released teh same way, and she would have still be dead.

the only difference is he was here illegally and like it or not that doesnt predicate that he is a murderous asshole, as this would have happened had he been an american.

they simply wont turn them over to ice, without violence or robbery. A drug charge and being here illegally, there is no way they can predict that means he wil turn to violence. Yeah its trajectory but it isnt like they "put a previously violent illegal" back on the streets. No they put a previously caught with over 2 ounce of pot 4 times due on the streets, the other 3 were reentry which they dont recognize and would have had released he been american too.

so a judge released a man he had every reason to assume he was a non violent criminal on the streets, due to state law not turning voer non violent people in this country illegally. Tragedy yes, but this isnt quiet how some are makiing it.
 




 and none of his previous felonies were violence, they were all drug related.
 




 true, hes just being technically correct.. the tree in the water is bonsai like. The bon in bonsai means its in a pot.

so while it is a cute tiny tree that was probably formed naturally in much the same way as man made bonsai.. meaning the roots get pruned either by air or water.. ad it is cool as fuck, but it isnt actually literally a bonsai tree.

that being said I have no problem with it being called a bonsai simply do to resemblance even if technically it isnt one.

if we put it in a pot though......

 




 yeah thats the problem with time shifters comments.

even as he trys to justify it from below.

that has nothing to do with teh socrats method either(not that he ever claimed it was) and it really doesnt work because basically you are belittling someone.. making them feel bad, while presenting yourself as someone with stank less shit.

All he will end up doing is pissing people off.

seriously.

And yeah we all do it some on the net.

Does pointing out extremes ever work?

all you do is get them more set in theri ways.

and make them feel bad about themselves and less wanting to listen to the smart ass, being smug.

You force them to justify a belief that contradicts their beliefs

nope, you will never get there. They will get pissed and tell you a to fuck off.. because you have been trreating them like a dumbass.. who needs to be educated, rather than  an intelligent person who knows the aswers themselves.

Liek this.. people say tax cuts actually cause the government to get more revenue.. i know yall heard this claim

I have often smuggly said.. "well the perfect tax is zero and we will be awash in money.. or even better, lets make it negative and we will be so rich and have so many jobs, we will be expanding welfare to other countries while begging mexicans to cross the boarder"

how many people you think that converted? How many replies from tax cutting advokates do you think i got? How many do you think just got upset at my snarkyness?


and yes that is logical and just like timeshifter is saying we should do.

and yet nearly 100% of them got upset rather than educated and think more of me as an ass than a teacher. IT doesnt work. You cant belittle people on their beliefs and expect them to change

and yes i have done it a lot.. and shouldnt.. cause it absolutely never works.

you cant educate someone from a position of hostility or egotistical superiority. Peoples brains just say fuck off.
 




 le meuh
 




 Thats not his problem

His problem is A.. the dude he is replying to shows no trait you could ascribe to the Socratic method and his description of the Socratic method is so bastardized by his comment on pwning that  he seems to miss the entire point of the Socratic method. one of the points of the Socratic method is it makes the person you are speaking with, feel more your equal and feel more like he is coming up with teh idea rather than being told. There is NO PWN at all.. thats kinda of the point. THE Socratic method makes the student feel good about themselves. PWNing and the crap timeshitter goes off on, are really in opposition to the Socratic method.

And 1000 years on, its still the best way to teach anyone anything.

its the difference from "be very careful, with that.. if you spill it it will get everywhere" versus.. "what do you think will happen if you tip that over".. "oh you think it will make a mess? "so how do you think you should treat it"... oh carefully, yess you are correct. Its leading someone to the right answer versus telling thems the right answer. WHen they are leadto use their own mind, they learn better, then simply told a fact.



 




 actually no.. pointing out "logical inconsistancies" isnt the socratic method. WHy would you think it was? where does he even exhibit any of that crap?

all you have to do is keep pointing out the blatant inconsistencies in their own viewpoints.

That my friend, is describing statements not questions.

and calling someone a dumbass, while saying "you are exhibiting this logical fallacy" wont get you anywhere with anyone.


and socrates wasnt about pwning people or making them feel like shit. IT is a learning method where you help the people find the answers for themselves through questsions versus statements. IT creates a much stronger bond in the mind when they actually get their themselves rather than told they were wrong by some smug smart ass who things be is better than they are, EVEN IF  HE ACTUALLY IS IN THIS LIMITED SUBJECT.

 




 unfortunately if this was reality, there wouldnt be so many of them.

you arent the only one to try to dispell their fucked up believes.

Most of these people went to college.

and its been proven that your approach actually makes them dig their heals in.

you want to know better? a little less smug and assholish?

get them their by questions and not statements. When you attack them for their beliefs they will ignore you. You help them lead their selves there.. and it might actually help.

you really arent doing any good at all.
 




 /r/animalsbeingderps 




 problem is those people dont change their minds and they are the ones making the laws.

Unless you have changed the mind of the  house  republican head of the science committee  who believes the earth is only 6000 years old, evolution is bs, global warming is a scam invented by al gore, and and that teh big bang theory came from the devil. SHould I wait while you fix this?
 




 well except in this case its true. Anti intellectualism has been peddled by the american right for so long that education is akin to another dirty word of theirs elitist. 









 whats more amazing is no one would have given a crap in 2012 




 she also said the Australian worker was greedy and [wanted to be paid too much, because other mining moguls.. get workers in africa to work for $2 a day.. so Australians need to take a pay cut.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2198868/Gina-Rinehart-Worlds-richest-woman-calls-Australian-workers-paid-2-day.html)

cunt is a bit too nice of  a word for her 




 is it adjusted?

just a question, cause i make more than my parents, didnt see it in the article, but maybe my old eyes missed it.
the point is 60k today might be more than 50k yesterday, but not wiht inflation.

thanks for answering
 




 doesnt matter if he could afford.. its unusual it gets reported and besides he probaly used the car in committing the crime. 




 not really.. he just raped a woman, violating the very law he was supposed to upheld and then blackmailed her.

and probably used the car to pick her up

and its hyper unusual

the shits going to be reported.

If he rode off on a skateboard it would bre reported too.. why? cause it would be fucking weird for a corrupt cop to rape a woman and then black mail her and then jump on a skateboard to get away.

you people harping on the car are ridiculous. it would be reported no matter what and should. No being rich isnt a crime. Being a cop and having a lambo is unusual as fuck and unusual as fuck gets people to read your shit.

 




 and no one thinks he used an exotic sports car to get his victim to go with him?

its a TOOL OF THE CRIME.
 




 hes a crooked rapists cop who happens to also unusually drive a lambo

sorry its newsworthy

its kinda amazing how upset so many of yall are over the reporting of the car.

the dude is oviously a douche

he raped a woman

and then black mailed her

and the CAR IS PROBABLY HOW HE GOT TO HER ANYWAYS

yeah maybe this douche got the car legit. I have a feeling if he was a thief you would get it. The guy already proved he doesnt care about the law

and hey lets say his department provided it.. ITS STILL PERTINENT.. he used a lambo to pick up a girl and rape her and then blackmailed her to shut the fuck up.

deal with teh dam car and lets talk about teh contents of the story.

So sorry some of yall dont get it.

**Its unusual and the dude is a fucking rapist asshole.
its going to be reported. Fuck it would be reported if he flew away in a balooon, even though the fucking balloon had nothing to do with the rape. WHY? CUASE IT IS UNSUAL.** 




 well actually the idea was sold as a way to catch more criminals.

one using a drug dealers own car

and the other was the police force got access to a wide variety of undercover cars versus all the ltds they used to be provided with

it was never sold as intimidation.


doesnt mean it doesnt work that way.. but they never presented it that way 




 you dont normally see rapists cops driving lambos
but hey maybe you do.
AND the wealthy always get bored and join one of the more dangerous police forces in the country

I think some of you are just perturbed.. does it matter he had a lambo?

NOPE

but think of this.. HE IS A FUCKING CRIMINAL

you fucking admitted he is a fucking criminal


dont think a fucking criminal might also do other criminal shit?

LEts say some asshole robs you.. steals your pos pinto.. cops come to his house and he has two lambos in the driveway.. would you automatically assume he got that from a lotto.. and legal?

why not? I am saying we have proof either lambos are not legitamately bought.. not the imaginary ones i made up.. or the ones from the story. But both would be reported.. WHY..

HES A FUCKING CRIMINAL.

 




 i'm betting there are more corrupt people than lotto winners.

hummers arent lambos.. that would have had to be a much bigger settlement and a much stupider use of it 




 you cant buy a destroyed lamborghini on a cops salary 




 well not one of those conspiracy folks.. but.. the president only has as much power as he can get through congress.

[there are 12 jewish members of the senate](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/jewcong113.html)

that is [12% of the senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate)


the [jewish population is 2% of the us](https://www.google.com/search?q=jewish+percentage+in+us oq=jewish+perc aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l5.4055j0j1 sourceid=chrome es_sm=122 ie=UTF-8)

so 6x the representation.


yeah i am fueling the conspiracy, only due to your discounting it, though i do believe we would find if we looked a wide range of reasons for this reality over world domination conspiracy.

and [besides some sects of christianity are over represented by even more, some under and us athiests way under](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_affiliation_in_the_United_States_Senate#Compared_with_general_population)
 




 [passion flower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passiflora)

down here we say it has to do with jesus or something, the loaves and fishes and .. ahh [here is a litle of that](http://www.blueboyherbs.com/Passion_Flower.html)
 




 and your parents can annul it until you are 20.

 




 YEP I am.

and you have been debunked before you even commented.

These are christians. The identfiy with it. They just are more progressive and they are just as much christian as the conservative ones who ignore poverty, who reinterpret the eye of the needle, who ignore working on sundays and lying politicians and multiple marriages.. but GAYS.. OMG GAYS.. there was 2 verses in the old testament about gays.. of course ignore when we point out the worst of the old testament 'christians" always say it doesnt count anymore.. until they need it to count.

Sorry not buying your "no true christian' comment.
 




 well i def see a lot of the religious as super narcissistic to the point of mania. Maybe not the perfect term, but they made religion into a body mold, that fits them perfectly God dont care that much about their sins, but he sure hates everything you do.. and cares about the sins others do that you care about.

lying? eh god wasnt serious.

working on sunday? yeah that was a long time ago.

help the poor? LOLOL, i think liberals added that part.

But gays.. yeah fuck them, and Dont call me a bigot, gods the one who said that, not me.


basically we do have a lot of self worshipers.

(and just to pull back a little, it is kinda human nature to see your own shit dont stink but others do... i might cook some stinky ass food but its my neighbors walking on the ceiling thats really annoying but still point is valid, they have a religion of self.)
 




 its most used by conservative catholics who disagree with the progressives on what is the main beliefs.

you know some people think the gay marriage thing is a more important fight than helping the poor, and well some think the exact opposite. dont really have to tell you which is which?

 




 so "the religious"

yeah wake me up when someone threatens to set themselves on fire because we let people work on sundays.... that part was only written in stone..matter of fact the term "written in stone" meaning permanent or important, comes from this exact story.

 




 Totally untrue man. And sorry if we only did one thing at a time, we would still be arguing over spear heads.

[Fallacy of relative privation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_relative_privation)


we can be concerned over healthcare and the enviroment.

I can be concerned over feeding my kids and the power bill.

The world doesnt stop as we solve one problem at a time.
 




 sorry dude you are wrong on so many levels.
First most our oil comes from canada, we hardly get shit from the middle east. and you know with the shales and fracking, the us production is through the roof.

the problem is oil is a world wide market.. and so the middle east is going to be a big player.

Its also really stupid to suggest we do one thing at a time. I get these issues are ones that dont mean shit to you, but if it was school vouchers and killing obamacare you would be cheering from the rafters.

Its a bad fallacy and something yall do all the time, to suggest we can only do one thing at a time.

yall said the same with healthcare "its the economy, sure people dying in our system sucks but look at UE" and some how we managed to do both at once. I know crazy.

sorta like how google can do the search engine shit, the youtube shit and still manage to find time to do the isp thing and the phone thing. WOW amazing, so much multi tasking.


and dude.. the gay marriage and confederate flag wouldnt have been such a issue, if your side didnt fight it tooth and nail into the ground. dude, your side is still fighting a losing issue after they lost. So give me a break. Seriously if it is no big deal.. if we should be concerned on other things, why did the right put up such a fight? why are they spending millions in my state to try to keep fighting gay marriage?

nah your side is transparent, gay marriage is important, your just upset that the ruling went against your views.

 




  I would be equally annoyed if developing nations could be more profitable simply because nobody is holding them accountable for polluting. I understand that these laws surrounding fossil fuel production and emissions DO have a big effect on the consumer in terms of price for food, goods, and most other things that require fuel/energy in the modern world.


thats actually one of the big  nearly intractable fights. Both sides have valid points.

the poor nations say the rich nations got theri on cheap co2 and they should have the right to do the same or get compensated for being asked to leave it in the ground, because the right nations have already over polluted. They didnt add all that to our co2 ppm.. we did, they just are starting now.

where rich nations want everyone under the same per capita rules.

and you also got to figure, most of the poor nation polluting is to service the richer nations, and often they didnt build that crap, richer nations put that crap in poorer nations for the cheap labor.

 




 their subsidies dont hurt 




 I think that argument could easily be destroyed by someone who understands the science. but then again those who tend to scream the loudest about planes, are the ones who dont even believe in agw.


 




 well you know the funny thing?

It used to be the opposite. "It's" used to be possessive.

[So its kinda funny to see the people correcting, when this way was actually the first correct way.](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=its)

wyrmsaintph is just being old school. :P


 




 its a cheap excuse.. that might be true..and yes some of those standards were made so their darwin candidates could live.. but the thing had lights and noises and witnesses prove she was an idiot.

Sure was the idiot protection not completely installed? yeah. Sounds like she would have died anyways. Thats just a lawyer being a lawyer, and noticing that updated code hadnt wound its way all the way down. 
 




 thats just some laywerese for my clients and idiot. 




 google wont help.. its mainly impatient people, ignoring the flashing lights that are normally there, assuming the train is traveling slower than it is.

we had to put the gates all over town to try to get people to actually stop for the flashing lights. 




 yeah there is a coalition of right wingers with different goals.

some trying to kill teacher unions because the want to get rid of all that labor protection crap.. they are trying to make the US more ceo centric for a polite term.

some want to change the history, to try to train more americans to be accepting of the right winger BS.. like trickle down. They are like if science and evidence is against us, we will just teach people it worked anyways.

there are the bigots that hate their kids go to school with black kids.. its kinda big in some areas down here.. in some of the areas where the public schools are a bit minority heavy in population.


and they join with the religious who want to downplay evolution. but it is definitely multiple groups with multiple goals 




 its in the article.. not picking just saying.

The vouchers were at the heart of a series of conservative reforms that have transformed Douglas County into an educational battleground in recent years, pitting teachers unions, civil liberties groups and liberal parents against conservative families, a majority conservative school board and a group backed by the billionaire conservative Koch brothers.

 




 good it didnt happen.. but the right are pretty fucked up with the revisionism.. and the left would never get away with that crap. Can you imagine us forcing textbook makers to make our history more progressive? maybe play up more how much of a traitor to the country reagan was, and how his actions caused a lot of trouble and we were all saved by bill clinton. and progressivism.

The right winger chant on brainwashing would be deafening. It really would be. We would be called hitler, stalin and every other oppressive controlling regime on the planet.

i think the left must not do that as much cause the right cry so loudly when we point out their bs. It is amazing how fast they can go from tough guy to pooor little ole victims.
 




 This whole thing isn't about public vs. private schools so much as it is a bunch of well-funded fundamentalists being upset their kids are being taught things like gasp science, and history.

yeah well part of that is decline of favor of conservatism, and they want to teach that fucked up history texas school board is in favor of, you know the one where slavery barely happened and was no big deal.. thomas jefferwho? yeah we dont need him no more. and the freemarket  killed hilter. and protests against the gov? never happened.

and then their is some resegregation going on.

but yeah the koches arent spending millions on pushing the voucher program for religious reasons.. they want to control how people learn.. its private market big brother. 2 +2 = 5 cause the koch brothers need people to think its 5.

the fascist right, just find helpful allies in the uber religious right.
 




 we they were ruled legal.. and they are trying to take it back to scotus.

and yeah the kochs, fucked that place up 




 well figured cause it said colorado court, but yeah some might not get that. They arent right either way. The right are using them for resegregation and to stop teaching evolution. 




 wot 









 it depends on the area, but some small areas are like that. Quick look at the map and yeah this place is [nowhere ohio](https://www.google.com/maps/place/105+Milan+Elyria+Rd,+South+Amherst,+OH+44001/@41.3579614,-82.2401419,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x883a753f97d9df6f:0x9064196cbc1073d7)

could be a bonus though, could  get min wage but a bonus if called. 




 yeah they actually said that in a different acticle. They were banned on the rides forever, but people ignored it. They kept having to stop rides because people had the sticks out and they could hurt someone. and since a lot of people couldnt follow the rules at the ride, they ban them at the gate. I think they said they stopped a ride for like 45 minutes.. and that they got to stop when they see people with them, just incase. 




 we'd look scarier with a bunch of beards
 




 but yall all do walk around pushing your $50 [watermelons in their own little  cooler cart](http://theawesomer.com/photos/2010/07/072010_portable_watermelon_cooler_1.jpg), like I invision?
 




 most likely a lot of us wont see it in our life times.

i suspect first we will expand the food stamp program to include everyone.

we will greatly expand the military for jobs.. and greatly expand things like park service, more and more of us will work for the government as jobs in the private sector get automatized.

they will shift society this way and that to avoid basic income.

and it wont even have a chance, before hiring the entire country becomes completely untenable.  but they will try.
 




 and it wont be simple and we should debate exact more what it would entail.

obviously pretty much all of welfare gone except maybe healthcare.

no more min wage i suppose

and what about legal and illegal immigration? i have mixed thoughts on that, since as long as non citizens didnt get the basic income, it shouldnt be horrible if they took some jobs.  But i'm not sure the whole effects a basic income would have on society.

the right would probably want more appeasement, maybe we would actually have to do the civil service they want, like in israel where everyone spends a couple years in the military or some other civil server. and maybe even keep the perpetually unemployed on call for civil duty, like after natural disasters and such.

theres going to be trading to go on to get this through.  Its not going to be peaches and cream, we are going to have to choke down some bad things i think just to have a chance.

shit do you know how long we have been fighting for single payer? and the evidence it works is all over the planet. we still aint got it.
obamacare is about the worst BETTER idea than we had. But its a step. we actually changed something. And look at what it went through just becoming and staying a law. Heck people brought out guns to the debates. There were fist fights, one dude lost a finger. And it barely passed. and barely survived twice.

its a simple solution with a hard as fuck implementation.

its debris from an unidentified flying object  ;)
 




 one more i really like, especially for family but i have to admit i like it too.  [unchecky](http://unchecky.com/). All it does is make sure none of crapware is checked, when you install things, even if they are below scroll bars or worded weird.  So no more avg toolbars and crap.

i admit i missed the check box now and then and cursed avg or aoil or who ever as i uninstall their shit. but it really shines for less computer literate relatives where the toolbars seem to breed.
 




 The fact that this is a debate, shows that perhaps we need to work a little on our language. Sure we could work more on teaching grammar but when so many have trouble in some areas, like the rules of the semicolons, it might be time to revisit the idea and see if we can come up with more intuitive ideas. And put some hats on our vowels, that's just handy.

lol people good at grammar always downvote this stuff. Like it or not our language is more mistake prone due to not having hats for our vowels. Imagine this, archeological dig in the future, and they find this big device, some people think it's some kind of mechanism like a clock, others think it's a horrible torture device. They dig out more and find a small plaque and all the writing is worn off but one word- wound. With the information at hand, is it a clock? or a torture device? hats would help.
 




 well now they can profit from it, like they did the wiretaps. 




 I like [treesize free](http://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/)

it will show you were the big files are hiding. But some prefer [windirstat](https://windirstat.info/) and a few others.

dont worry about memory, just have enough in your computer. I mean well you can stop some of the bullshit from loading up from the task menu in the start up tab, but besides for that, all the memory cleaners... are bullshit and sometimes actually hurt.

if no antivirus i would at least get [cryptoprevent](https://www.foolishit.com/cryptoprevent-malware-prevention/) it just blocks some policies that prevents most ransomware infections.


and get [ublock for adblocking.. its much better than adblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en).. you really need adblocking if you go to seeder parts of the web, its really a security tool to me.


there are some lightweight free ones, nortons mostly fine.. i'm messing with bitdefender right now.

there are some watcher apps that are nice sometimes for av, like [winpatrol](https://www.winpatrol.com/), that just monitor for shit like changes in your homepage or file associations which many malware do. and its pretty light 




 really?

one you can undo, if it turns out you are wrong, one you cant.

thats pretty compelling.

for all our punishments.

there is also the psychological aspect, where as if your government can find reasons to kill that arent due to self defence, then so can you. if the government can kill someone because they think they are a shitty human, so can you.  not saying all murderers would see this and say.. wow i'm not going to kill that dude.. but it does appear to influence society temperament.
 




 there are many counts where multiple witnesses picked the wrong people and later DNA proved they werent there.


and heck just recently.. [the various eye witness account of the darren willson investigation](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/11/25/why-many-eyewitnesses-in-the-darren-wilson-investigation-were-wrong/)

how can you read this story and still have your opinion that 3 or more is all you need to kill someone

[Eyewitness misidentification is the greatest contributing factor to wrongful convictions proven by DNA testing, playing a role in more than 70% of convictions overturned through DNA testing nationwide](http://www.innocenceproject.org/causes-wrongful-conviction/eyewitness-misidentification) 




 well in my experience it can take people a while and they keep cable for all kinds of reasons besides sports. One lady i knew kept it for public broadcasting, before i showed her she could get it over the air where she lived.

and a lot of people know netflix is better but it takes a bit to get used to for older folks. they are more used to habit.. they watch a certain evening news and crap every night.
 




 I was always wondering what the fuck they were talking about in red dwarf after getting attacked by the despair squid. [And rimmer screams chicane!](https://youtu.be/IJOvFHJB4s0?t=1167)

(i'm weird about words i dont know, and couldnt ever spell that one good enough for google) 




 lolol what planet do you live on.

if you cant afford it you get subsidies.

you oviously dont know what you are talking about

and if your insurance went up by 3x which i think you are lying, like all them fucks the koch brothers put on tv.. but if it did.. you had cracker jack insurance that would have been denied the first chance you got really sick.. which was a huge huge problem with the indivual market before Obama even became president.

and because you lost insurance, you want 17,000 people to die? if you cant afford insurance, you can get medicaid. Or subsidies.

sorry it hurt you.. it helped most people, including my nephew who had a preexisting condition from birth.


but the indivual market was all fucked up.. 

[Nearly Nine of Ten Who Seek Individual Market Health Insurance Never Buy a Plan](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/press-releases/2006/sep/nearly-nine-of-ten-who-seek-individual-market-health-insurance-never-buy-a-plan)


[Article: Retroactive Cancellation/Rescission of Individual Health Plans](http://attorneypages.com/hot/health-insurance-cancellation.htm)

[People left holding bag when policies revoked](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070129/1a_cover29.art.htm)

so yeah I say you either had complete shitscaminsurance.. or you are lying. so be vague if you want.

just tell us work or individual market.

what carrier and what state.

because I am betting either it was scaminsurance, or that we can find you comparable insurance for no where near 3x the price.
 




 well its cheaper on all of us because people who can afford insurance but refused to, have to buy.. and those people who could afford insurance but refused to, when they needed care they used the emergency room in many cases where a family doctor would be cheaper and better.

total medical spending growth is the lowest in decades.

and we are losing less americans each year due to preventable deaths... mostly due to a lack of insurance.

harvard also showed that republicans are going to kill up to 17000 americans this year due to not expanding medicaid despite it is already paid for.


[The decision by 25 states to reject the expansion of Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act will result in between 7,115 and 17,104 more deaths than had all states opted in, according to researchers at Harvard Medical School and the City University of New York.](http://www.pnhp.org/news/2014/january/more-than-7100-deaths-likely-from-states-rejection-of-medicaid-expansion-%C2%A0health-a)

but fuck them, they arent bankers in a tower where we got to spend trillions of dollars blowing up people a world away, while you people dont give a fuck that we are losing 5 times as many every year as we did in 911 to TOTALLY PREVENTABLE CAUSES.

want to make any other stupid comments? or do you want to just say fuck your fellow americans, if they didnt want to die they shouldnt have taken that insurance less job at mcdonalds that put them over the states medicaid limits?

is that the ticket dude? How come yall realize we live in a society, when a plane hits a tower, but ignore we live in a society as our own citizens die around you due to your parties callous greed?


ps obamacare is cheaper than that turd medicare plan D which wasnt even funded.. and saved more lives.
