 No Ragrets! 




 It's funny, back in the "dark" days we were irrelevant, Fitz wasn't so bad.  Maybe it was b.c there wasn't much to cheer about, but I don't remember getting annoyed since I didn't mind listening to him on KNBR.  But slowly as we got better Fitz began to change as well, more so on the radio.  He would actually berate callers if fans criticized the Warriors management, etc.  

Now when you turn the game on, Fitz is unbearable.  He's such a homer at the most obvious times, and his stubborn insistence of using "Human Torch" has worn thin 




 CP3 and his flopping ass.  He's always getting tangled up and then throws his hands up in the air when a foul gets called against him.  

Right behind CP3 is Blake Griffin and his flopping ass.  Someone that big always on the ground?  And then tries to pull the tough guy act?  Fuck those 2 




 17 y.o can't calm shit 




 Similar happening but on a bus tour.  My wife and her friend did a bus tour from NYC-New Orleans (3 day ride).  The bathroom on the bus was not working because it was a old bus.  A huge sign was on the door that clearly stated not to use the bathroom either.  

Clearly, the sign didn't matter as the passengers (mostly Chinese) all used the toilet.  About 2 hours into the ride and the entire bus smells like a septic tank.  Literally the entire bus smelled like shit and none of the Chinese passengers seemed to mind.  It was still day 1 of the trip 




 You hit it on the mark re "look out for yourself".  Buddy of mine who used to live in China said it's because of the way communism works over there.  Literally every single person is looking out for themselves only, and loses complete disregard for others.   




 You know it's bad when they have [signs](http://www.businessinsider.com/china-is-embarrassed-by-its-tourists-2013-5) at the Louvre in Chinese 









 Along the same lines, but there's gotta be some correlation between fast food and aggression  




 Dahntay Jones don't play, what's he doing in the picture?   




 Born in 77 as well, and was definitely spoiled growing up.  I remember times if the 49er's weren't up by more than 3 TD's that I would start panicking.  Especially the '95 team which was so fun to watch.  You just don't realize how good you have it til you see the same team go downhill.   




 Fitz a legend?   




 I'm feline it 




 Wallace never struck me as a "team" guy, and there's been reports he gives up on plays.  Plus he doesn't block well in the run game 




 Young's 1 on 1 play wouldn't jive with a lot of playoff teams.  No way in hell teams like the Warriors would let him disrupt chemistry by him jacking up 3ptr and 3ptr.  In fact, there's probably a reason teams weren't pushing harder before the trade deadline 




 I'm Asian, I don't sound like that 




 It also depends on what you're doing before/after games.  Grande Hyatt is nice, but not much going on late late night.  The weekends are even worse.  

If you're going strictly for the games, I'd suggest downtown Oakland.  The hotels won't be as nice, but you can get to OCO in 20 min or less.  And these days , the bar and restaurants are solid on Broadway.  




 I'm Asian, and I don't sound like that  









 Tasmanian devil for sure.   




 Exactly why when child and sex abuse cases come up, you try and not have the child repeat their story multiple times.  Each time it could change slightly, especially if they have to testify 




 This is kinda creepy, but I sat a few rows behind you guys!  Sec 103?  I was chuckling to myself when I saw the Vo jersey.  Way to represent the bay, there were hella Dubs fans.  The best was when the crowd started to chant "MVP" when Curry was at the line 









 Purely speculation, but Harbs refusing to bench Aldon and Ray Mac after their arrests played a part.  Our window to win the Super Bowl is 2 years max, and it would be risky to keep the staff intact and gamble another season.   




 I'd bring up the fact that the Warriors were awful for the longest period of time.  We were the laughing stock of the league, but the fans were still so loyal.  That should get a conversation going.  

Another topic I like to bring up at sports bars is the excitement Curry brings to the NBA.  The last time I felt as though a player could dominate a game was MJ/Kobe.  There's times when everyone stops what they're doing and just watches Curry drop 3's from downtown.  The last player to capture that kind of excitement was Jordan.  And please, this is not an comparison of players.  Just a comparison of how dominating and exciting these 2 players are 




 I wish they could do a study on the effects of Fast Food and Anger.  There has to be some kind of correlation and how it affects the brain.   




 True, I think there is just more of it theae days due to reddits popularity.   




 It's bc the demographic of Reddit has changed in the recent years.  This place used to have great content with real conversation.  

Now you got a bunch of young H.S and college kids that like to troll and post crap comments.

Remember a few weeks ago, there was a pic of a guy dying of cancer that posted a pic of his wedding day?  Some redditors joked about his baldness, others made fun of his fiance.  Truly tasteless 




 BC there's a lot of teenagers on this sub.  Once he got the swaggy nickname, he became this icon around here.  Pointless and stupid  




 I think this is similar to sports analytics which many teams in basketball use.  There's a ton of metrics and spreadsheets that essentially gives you data such as best spot for jump shots, running certain plays, etc. 

This stuff is used a lot esp since its devised from programmers in Silicon Valley.  

My guess is that the F.O is huge on this formula with Marathe heading it 




 I'm waiting for the sequal, Whore 2.   




 It wouldn't be this bad if the F.O had a actual plan in place.  Watching everything unfold, it looks as though they're grasping at straws.  

We went from proven leader and success to somewhat unproven (Tomsula's 100% win percentage is too small a margin)

Put it this way, the Seahawks game last week was unbelievable.  Special teams did some amazing shit, and the play calls were remarkable.  You think we can match that kind of wits right now with that staff?  
 




 Wouldn't go as far as troll account, that's giving him too much credit.  I like the term "Internet Tough Guy"

"Hey!  Look at me, I found Reddit and now I'm talking shit and feel like such a strong man"  beating chest and cock together simultaneously  




 Was thinking Mangina 




 I meant in terms of the dislike the teams have for each other 




 This year our rivalry is with Houston.  The clippers are an after thought  




 I bet he's a blast at parties 




 I'll take it one notch further.  Reddit is about pics and discussion.  But at what point is the line drawn where stock photos are posted without credit, or posting of pics without any explanation of where it originated?  

This sub in the past was real food from real people.  Now all I see is a glamour shot and a title that screams "strawberry filled  strawberry cheesecake!!!"

Mind you that post I was referring to had its water mark cropped out  




 [Here](http://badblooddocumentary.com/) is a informative documentary that details what went on  




 You gotta wonder if this all the handpicking done by Balke.  I really doubt Tomsula wants it this way.  But again, this is part of being a "yes" coach to the F.O.  Tomsula will agree to it b.c he wants his shot as a Head Coach 




 Can you explain how this is considered fast food?   




 I do sound like that "guy".  Even the other day I told my wife by how shitty music had gotten.

But this pic is different, with a person dying,  enjoying whatever time they had left.  

Leave it to the punk ass to bring their own agenda.  The jk wasn't even funny.  Reddit 4 years ago is way different than today.  There were trolls and such, but much more worse now 




 They have an in house patisserie, all she does is bake bread.  And the butter from France along with salt was incredible.  

Again, never thought I would rave about such simple foods, it was unbelievable 




 If you're able to create+ taste what was posted, you could work at any restaurant in NYC or in the world.  

The chefs that work at Eleven Madison usually go onto opening their own restaurants and those joints become well known.  

I get that a carrot seems so simple.  Having lived in different countries, I realized how much better produce is compared to the US.  

Perfect example?  Chicken sashimi in Japan.  Unheard of here right?  But what if the chicken was killed that morning by a person that specializes in certain breeds and its been handled for generations.  It tasted so clean, I had nothing to worry about. 

My point is, the food that you're used to, depending on where your from isnt comparable to what your seeing in this post 




 You wonder why reddit goes to shit these days?  Posts such as the one above.  Good job kiddo, you've discovered the Internet and now you have chance to act funny and hide behind a screen bc you'll never do in "real" life 




 You couldn't have post this at a better time.  There's a divide in this sub, and it's clear what makes front page and what doesn't.

Shooter sandwich, In and Out, charcuterie and cheese are all front page click bait.  Funny thing is, some of the pics are stock photos!  Some go even as far as cropping out the watermark.


What I'm trying to get at is, there's the older reddit population (30+) and younger generation and its evident when you read some of the comments in here.    




 You could do that at your house, but I'm pretty certain you won't be close to duplicating the same flavors  




 I used to think that was the case at these restaurants, but when my wife and I went to a 3 star, we almost had to be carried out. 

The dessert section alone was 4 courses and they let us take it home bc we couldn't finish it.   




 My wife and I went to jean gorges for our 1 yr.  Some of the dishes looked similar.  And I agree, the bread and butter was the best ever.  My wife even snuck extra pieces in her purse.   




 It's funny how every laker fan was bashing D'antoni, but looking back now, lots of folks would do anything to have him back 




 I like to lurk in r/Lakers sub every so often to read the absurd posts.  It's so cringe worthy.  Stuff like, can we trade for Anthony Davis?  Or let's trade Nash, Lin, and some draft picks for a super star.  

 




 I see the Xs and Os as Pop, and the mental aspect as Phil Jackson  




 Our window for "successful" is extremely small, maybe 2-3 years tops.  And as much as everyone has been praising our Defense, we lost McDonald and possibly Justin Smith.  That's 2 seasoned veterans gone right there.  

I'm optimistic, but very very cautious as to this year's draft.  The 2012 draft that Balke whiffed on can bite us in the ass down the road as well 




 Uhhh OK. Id much rather watch a old guy on TV than a pretty chick.  




 I'm throwing this out there.... There's a good chunk of Alex Smith fans that are still salty.  

There's also a good portion of folks that don't know shit about football in general, I.e possibly bandwagon, possibly generation gap, who knows.  But the posts on here are showing exactly that.   




 STEVE YOUNG HAS ONE RING FOOL

Congrats.  You done fucked up now.  You managed to "out" yourself as a fan that doesn't know shit about your own team.  

I was wondering these days the types of "fans" we had on r/49ers.  There's a huge divide in here and you just exposed it.  




 




 What's in your tare mixture? 




 So far what I love the best is that Steve Kerr is playing rookies and not afraid to put them in the lineup. Just like the spurs, gsw is going to be able to develop talent for the long run 




 Hey look, I can find pics on [pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/1688918586070362/) too and act like I made it or ate it!  Why not give credit where credit is due?  




 Source? 




 Please post a source.   




 Don't feed him, he's secretly a Clippers fan 




 what did you miss about him?  And if he were to be on the roster today, which player would you replace him with?  I get that he was a great teammate, but man it's comical he's even mentioned this year especially with us being title contenders  




 Be right back, heading to the gas station to pick up a burrito 




 It's b.c OP took this pic and claimed at as his.  This person has literally stolen dozens of other people's work and claimed as their own 




 I posted an answer similar to yours when the charcuterie incident went down.  

20 year old me would have posted burger and pizza pics all day 

Late 30s me is all about a home cooked meal I.e oxtail stew; handmade pasta, etc.   









 I love food, and everything about it, and I'm also a purist, which some could label as snobby.  But if I see a post that is inaccurate, or a stock photo, or people using words for click bait, I'll try and educate without being a dick.  Maybe it's b.c of my Japanese upbringing, who knows.  

But I assure you that this sub a few years ago had awesome content, all of it being genuine.  And I felt as though today was finally the day to bring this up as a conversation piece 




 You couldn't have replied this at a better time.  There's a healthy debate going on as I type this about this exact sort of B.S.   




 Thank you for doing that b.c OP hasn't posted a single recipe for any of the other posts.  The link that was provided which was quickly deleted was of the recipe you had mentioned.  
 




 Surprise surprise...look at the other posts submitted from OP.  3 other posts, no recipe.  Again, I'm not trying to bust people out, or be a dick, but this sub was a legit with "real" food from "real" people.  

 




 Last 30 days I haven't posted any food pics.  Feel free to see what I've submitted in the past.   




 That's pretty spot on.  A few years ago r/askreddit was starting to change with clickbait questions and unnecessary info before the question was asked.  The mods quickly enforced the rules and it got much better.    




 Top posts that usually make it are:

In and Out

Sushi drizzled with sauces

Charcuturie Plates

Shooter Sandwich

 




 I'm all for that, but I'm also seeing stock photos being re used from time to time.  There was a request awhile back where if you posted food pics from an establishment, it was necessary to add the name and location.  

 




 Serious question here.  This sub used to have quality posts of food pics that were amazing.  These days, it's taken a nose dive.  Case in point, the infamous charcuturie pic that was voted #1 for days.  Or today for instance, OP posting a burger claiming it to be Kobe.  

What's upsetting is that when you take the time to scroll down, there's actually some really solid, authentic cooking.  I'm done with my rant, please feel free to agree/disagree on this, or add suggestions as to how to improve this sub.   




 I'm betting most of those cases in the NYC courts are mary jane related 




 kid n play would like to have a word with you  




 I would put izakaya in the same class as tapas.  Small dishes to share that go well with drinks.   














 Sounds like the John Madden of football 




 Daring to go out on a limb here and risk the divide, but I think the demographics of r/49ers goes something like this:  Old timer fans, and New Generation fans

Early days fan born late 70's-early 80's= Fortunate to witness multiple Super Bowls, Joe Montana, etc...I myself was lucky to see this.  

Newer Gen Fans= Abysmal years Nolan, Singletary, etc..Then its Harbs and Kaep and we got ourselves a new team, new identity.  

I'm not dogging either one, but you can tell the discrepancy when reading posts and pics, comments, whatever.  But you did bring up a very good point, which is football discussions are very hard to relate in this sub.  I believe it's the generation divide amongst the fan base.  




 




 Defensive end all the way.  Our pass rush was nothing like the 2012 season.  And now that we lost McDonald and most likely Cowboy, we have some holes 




 The year Baltimore won it all, John Harbaugh fired his O.C midseason.  Unheard of, and ballsy, but it was the move that put them over the top.  Keep in mind, the O.C Cam Cameron was Harbaugh's close friend.  

Now flip the script and look at Jim.  He's loyal to a fault, which most likely cost him his job.  He should have been held accountable and I wouldn't to waste/risk next year retaining Jim and watching the same anemic offense we have for the past 2 years.  

his is the difference maker between the 2 brothers.  Jim is rowdy, ra-ra-ra, and loya, John is on the sidelines, composed and calm but rational.  There's some eerie similarities between SF+Baltimore, but the Ravens are coached way more efficiently with far less talent that SF.  
 
 




 Holmgren has a better approach and balance IMO.  He did more with less in Green Bay than Shanny did in Denver.  It's easy for me to say this now, but having Elway and T Davis is a formidable 1-2 compared to what Farve had in Green Bay.   




 Purely speculation, but my guess is bc Holmgren likes to have full control of football operations, which we all know Trent ain't gonna give up.  Curious as to why they were interested in Shanny since he usually is bith GM/Head Coach 




 This year I didn't know which 49er team would show up playing.  Sometimes they were run dominant, and other times they did spread offense which looked like dogshit.

Last year they were unpredictable at times, maybe bc of Crabtree.  I just wish they played like they did on the road in New England in 2012.  Moss and Crabs were balling out that game 


 




 Just curious but how much time does he interact with the F.O?  A daily basis, once in awhile?   




 Him and Fangio were assistants back in Baltimore during their hay days.  No doubt the guy knows defense.  Thoughts? 




 Wow before this, I never looked at Balke as a condescending person, but now it's a whole different light.  

Also, how the fuck can they say that they are looking for "teachers?"  Harbs was the best teacher 




 I remember reading an article when Harbuagh was first hired that he was excited to have access to hours and hours of Bill Walsh videos.  There was nothing this year that was remotely even close to WCO.  No slant patterns, no play action for deep passes, etc..

Was it because of a lack of speed receivers?  I'd like to hear thoughts 




 You know in the back of my head, I'm hoping that he leaves Mich early, and re signs with us.  Then at the press conference, Jed stands up and apologizes on camera and they both hug.  Camera angle then focuses on Balke standing in the back of the room, clapping slowly (80's movie reference)  and all will be restored in 49er land 




 We gotta get AD up on reddit 




 I wanna add that in DC, Shanahan hired his son as the coordinator and was very unprepared.   




 Yeah really, Cutler is way better.  So good, that he could beat the Pack in Green Bay in the dead of winter.  Or come from behind and beat Atl on the road.  Or set a playoff record for rushing yards by a Qb.   




 The Spurs play team ball to the ultimate degree.  Duncan doesn't give a shit about scoring, or how many touches he gets a game  




 Piggybacking off this, but what happened to our acclaimed West Coast offense?  I remember when harbaugh was hired early on, he said he had access to hours of bil Walsh videos of him breaking down offense.

There was nothing this year that looked remotely anything close to WCO.  No quick slants, no play action for bombs, timing patterns, etc.

It's as if he was trying to use his Stanford play book and tweak it to accommodate Kap. 




 We need someone proven, Holmgren, bill Cowher.   




 But how does letting jim go make the FO more comfortable?  The heat is on them moving forward.  Finding a new coach, having to answer to the relentless media is gonna be taxing.

 




 The niners FO is ran differently than the majority of nfl franchises.   Look at Dallas and the iron fist of jerry jones.  Cowboy fans are waiting for him to croak so they can start fresh.  

Or how about Cleveland and they're worthless owner who has a trigger finger for firing coaches.   

We have a win now mentality, and our window is closing quickly.  Again, I really don't think Jed and Trent are that petty and sensitive that they're letting jim go simply bc they dislike him.  

We're taking a humongous gamble here, but seeing how progressive we've been in literally every other business scenario, I'm at peace with this.   I for one can't stomach another dismal offense, and waste another year which it sounds like was going to happen since jim refused to let roman go 




 I want to give the FO the benefit of the doubt here.  Although we will never truly know the full story, harbaugh must have pissed the FO enough times for them to be fed up with it.  

It's not like there letting him go on a whim.  The FO knows how valuable he is/was.  They're not stupid, the fit isn't there anymore .  All I'm hoping for is that they have a legit candidate in mind.  One that is proven, I.e Holmgren, maybe Cowher.    




 And that's why it was comical seeing him taunt his own teammates last week in practice.  I get it that he's trying to push em and make em tough, but the whole "charmin" comparison and tough guy approach is cring worthy.  


 




 Without being judgemental in age, you can see the divide in generation gaps in r/food.  20 y.o old me would have post a burger or pizza and be completely thrilled.  

Not that those kind of foods are bad, but now that I'm in my late 30s, taking the time to enjoy a meal I.e oxtail stew, or risotto, hand made pastas are much more satisfying  




 You can tell the meat was taken straight out of a package, not even sliced from a real market.  I wanted to give props to the cheese, but again some basic grocery market shit.

Thing is, pretty sure if OP took the time, he/she prob could have found a legit cheese monger 




 Why does everyone assume fangio would consider the hc position?  He's been with Harbs for the last 2 gigs.  He's gone if Harbs is gone  




 No point trying to explain football to a newbie.   




 Rght and the inability to throw down the field is the OCs fault as well.  If Alex fanboys such as yourself keep spitting out the same excuse of switching coordinators, this argument has to wait for 5 more years till Kaep has had a few more years under his belt 




 So you did see the stat that a Chiefs WR hasn't scored a TD in a year?  Let that settle in for a second  




 I'm with you re Balke, and although he has made many good picks, the person prior to him is worthy of mention.  

Scott Mclouglin was the G.M before while Balke was the understudy.  Most folks jump to praise Balke, but let's not forget how who the person was before.  
And no surprise, after Sf fired Mcloughlin, Seattle hired him for a quick second.  




 What round do we take a QB?   




 This was the 2nd time same officer Daniel Pantaleo deployed a illegal choke hold.  I'm not sure how much bearing this had in the indictment, (obviously none) but you would think that the jury would weigh his past offense heavily.   




 The 2007 playoff series vs the Mavs felt like that.  I swear at one point, Oracle felt as if it were shaking
