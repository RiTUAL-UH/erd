 Are you saying that religious ideals are narrow minded? 




 Is it? 




 Are you calling religion "bullshit"? 









 what do you mean by "religious freak"?

 Who does 




 It's true.  My son-in-law operates a very successful business in E. Longmeadow with cash only.  It's a completely legit business, he pays his taxes on time and in full.  He just prefers to operate on a cash basis.  No banks involved. 

I think this is a pretty big thing out here in Western Mass.  Most of my friends and colleagues are bank-free.  Instead of socking away excess cash in a savings account or CD, most people are buying land or other assets that will grow over time. 



















 The POTUS role is not of captain, rather of cheerleader.  He/she has no real power. 




 Don't worry, he'll drop out soon enough, or the Clinton machine will do something drastic 




 This gear is not college-level.  This is pro gear that costs a lot of dough 




 It usually is. 




 People don't take him seriously because he's not a serious candidate.  He will drop out sooner or later.

 I learned how to drive on my Grandfather's John Deere tractor.  Been driving now for 53 years (I'm 63).  Never, not even once, been in an accident while I was driving. 









 hey 18 year olds fight our wars...why not drive out trucks too? 




 I'm actually thinking of doing it when I retire next year.  I'm in excellent health, have 20/20 vision, my night vision is impeccable, and I've always wanted to see more of the country.   




 we are amazing animals, we humans, but in the end, we are just animals 




 Agreed.  And taken pictures of the dogs, the leg, the owners and the location...but I'm sure they were freaked out and forgot all of that.  I work in an ER.  Some people just cant stand the sight of blood 







































 I saw someone driving a Smart car yesterday.  The license plate read "EPANTS" 




 Neat idea.  Incredibly slow 



















 I agree on the internet.  I spend a lot of time in South Korea.  When I come back to the states it feels like dial-up for double the money! 









 Lol it went right to spam!

 Awww, I miss @ekjp already :( 




 Two stickies for a week's worth of work?  Geez, can I have your job? 









 Because she obviously had no parents 



















 It's not about sitting at desks...it's about desk farms in corporations/businesses...that's what's on the outs.  If our dinky little hospital in Springfield, Mass can be more automated and efficient, why can't yours? 


































 They look like ballast to me (59 years of sailing) 




 Well I am an ER doc and most of my staff are nurses.  We use palm top devices for notating and keeping track of most things.  I do have a desk at home, but I rarely use it any more.  When I sit, it's to take a load off on a break.  Even our staff use hand-held devices.  The only people in my hospital that sit for their work are people that interface with the client support system...that is still pretty antiquated.  But it's changing.  For example, an IT firm from Boston just made a presentation last week about how the whole interface (registration, questions, scheduling, billing) system will be automated with touchpads and software within 2 years, eliminating the need for people to sit at desks. 




 Wake them up, you mean 




 I'm a physician.  I work at an ER for a big hospital near Springfield, MA 




 Holyoke, MA has more churches per square mile than any other industrial city in this New England state.  When the factories moved to Mexico and later China, the tax base in the city dropped by a huge percentage.  The city had to find a way to recoup its loss, so it forced the churches out (in subtle ways).  Many of them have been converted into public housing and private businesses, replacing some of the tax revenue and eliminating the waste. 




 Believe what you will.  Honestly, I can't say any more.  Don't ask me any more questions. 




 Several times a day.

We have software that can automate most tasks.

 It constantly amazes me that people still work at desks in offices... 




 I bought one 




 Regardless, he's either pathological or on serious drugs.  I'm guessing the former 




 You're absolutely right it could happen.  In fact it did, many times over.  Remember Katrina?  Yeah.  How about Sandy?  And that's just in the last 5 years...when I was younger earthquakes in California were rampant...seemingly every couple of years something would wipe out LA or San Fran... 




 I'm not a member of those groups 




 Therefore, God 




 Because the father is pretty stupid.  It amazes me that in this day and age, people consider "texting" to have the same value as talking in person.  This douchebag got all pissy because his girlfriend wouldn't answer his text, so he goes and tries to kill his family and himself.  That's fucked up 




 I hope you do and good riddance! 
























 Well maybe it wasn't you, but it was a lot of the same old conspiratards:

 Welp, they said they would...so it could be a coincidence 




 Also Seattle and parts of California according to this map http://map.ipviking.com/# 




 But it's not your body, it's your kids body, and if they are in a public school where there's a good chance of picking up germs or infecting other kids, neither I, nor the CDC want that to happen 




 Still waiting on your EMP from a month ago, OP 




 Yes yes and what's your point? 




 This whole "petition" thing is BS.   









 Not really.  I live in Amherst, Ma.  We're a college town with a population over 30,000 that goes down to around 6k during the summer

 Nice job, WNA.   




 met a kid tonight running a company that will unblock adblock called Ader, although he said he was changing the name

 I had an interesting experience in Colorado in the 1990s.  I did take pictures, but this was before the internet and good digital cameras.  My pics didn't come out 




 I never said I was an expert in Ukraine.  

Nobody said Dr Caldicott is an expert in geopolitics either.  She is an expert in nuclear issues, however. 




 You can't block a browser that uses adblock 




 Shoulda taken some pics anyway, if only for yourself 




 ooooo you got me! 














 Bully for you 









 "Briefly met"?  Is that how you describe it?  You're probably one of those christards that think the earth is only 6,000 years old 




 Well, I'm a medical doctor.  And she's an expert on nuclear topics.  Don't just assume.  Look it up

 Some of the first question is answered in this first video by Helen Caldicott, MD:

 The "War" in the Ukraine was started by the US.  There are so many nuclear bombs in the Ukraine it's ridiculous.  Why? 




 I'm always a bit miffed at stories like this about "the terrible ISIS" when nobody seems to remember the US created ISIS to fight Assad/Syria and continues to arm and fund them. 




 Reminds me of SamSpade.org (now defunct) 




 It's a waterfall.  Nothing else to say about it 



















 But crazy porn nonetheless...According to [VH1](http://www.vh1.com/celebrity/2007-05-09/bwe-exclusive-jared-fogle-the-pornography-guy/), this is nothing new:

"Well, it turns out in college, the All-American Jared was known for something entirely different. According to our source, while studying at Indiana University, Fogle ran a very successful pornography rental company out of his bedroom. His porn collection was vast and extensive, and Fogle took his business pretty seriously. A video would run a patron a dollar a day (cheap!), and people would come from all over to take advantage of the deal. Needless to say, Jared had enough porn to keep his customers happy."
