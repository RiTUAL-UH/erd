 The thing is... she really is ugly. I mean... come on people she looks like a fucking horror movie. 




 Congrat-u-fucking-lations you've managed to do something completely ordinary.  




 something something potato 




  I can jack off to this 




 yuck 




 "Against the Day" by Thomas Pynchon (more steampunk than sci-fi but still awesome)

"Diamond Age" by Neal Stephenson (a must-read for every human on the planet)

"Snow Crash" another Neal Stephenson

"Neuromancer" by William Gibson

"Feed" by MT Anderson 




 Hey Kevin Smith, the 90's called. They said shut up and kill me already. 




 Yikes, not aging well 




 or maybe you're just not so bothered by it because it's a female teacher and a male student. Reverse the sexes... do you feel the same way? 




 why why why is a teacher taking a student out anywhere? This movie was cringey. 




 good thing I typed this then eh? 




 can't lose the ugly though 




 I know it's too soon for the next review, the half-drunk bottles are starting to pile up...but I didn't make the purchase this time. This cute respiratory therapist that I work with is trying to win brownie points with me so brought me a few samplers. I'm excited for this one especially because it will be the oldest scotch I've reviewed so far. Here goes...

The BenRiach 16 yr

43% ABV

I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.

Color: light amber

Nose: honey, butter, intense fresh pear

Taste: cinnamon, nutmeg, tart apple

Finish: oily, spicy burn right up the nose

Best Speyside I've had as of yet, though I must admit the only Spey I've had is Speyburn. Not much character to it though. A forgettable whiskey.

3/5 stars

Thanks for reading!
 









 your kid is a dumbass 




 weird face weird feet

 Welcome back! Another paycheck, another bottle. And to my fellow beginners, good luck!




The Macallan 10 yr Fine Oak

40% ABV

I take my scotch one ounce at an time, room temperature, with a dash of water.

Color: lite beer yellow

Nose: lemon oil, raisins, bread dough, faint fudge

Taste: its so very complex and pleasant I'm having a hard time separating the flavors... its like a heavenly flavor all its own...I'll try my best here...oak, toasted marshmallow, orange, cocoa, faint burnt butter, faint pineapple...holy shit did I drink three drams already?

Finish: a wonderful full-mouth burn that leaves behind a pleasant aftertaste of oak and hickory

OK folks, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is my favorite scotch since I started reviewing. I know a had a lot of love for my Glenfiddich 12, but this is just so much more awesome. Annnnd....I'm drunk. 

4.5/5 stars


Thanks for reading! I'm gonna have another drink....
 









 um no...I dwell on the fact that they exist in the first place and feel they deserve special treatment 




 If you personally base someone's intelligence on how they feel about fat people, I guess so.  




 Woof 




 Smoking is bad mmmmkay 




 the fun thing about this post is that it's going to be easy to spot the fatties 




 You had me at "From the director of The Incredibles"..... Ghost Protocol? ugh 




 pork, jackass, pork 














 So you won't shit? How can you hold all that in? That's gonna give you an infection. 




 But did he make the Kessel run in twelve parsecs? 




 you said you didn't like the taste of blood, either do I, but I like rare steaks 




 You obviously give a little bit of a shit if you're taking time to defend yourself 




 but you don't like steak 




 you don't like steak 




 I assure you there are bigger twits 




 it's not blood. Educate yourself 




 man up 




 yeah right 




 pussy 




 ignorance 




 then you don't like steak 




 it's not blood 




 because they are uncultured freaks 




 then you don't like steak 




 stick your dick in the steak because if you cook it well done you're fucking your meat 




 she's a dude lookin chick 




 that's not blood, that's protein juices. The blood is drained out of the cow at the slaughterhouse 




 no, fuck your tastebuds 




 probably your raging herpes 




 no I'm a masturbating therapist 




 she is so fucking beautiful 




 just get some beef jerky 




 a medium rare steak is not raw...dummy 




 do it up yourself 




 no....just....no 




 run that steak through a warm room....that's how I likes it 




 pan fry a cheap steak---just as good as the expensive steak 




 you do not like steak 




 troo troo 




 its all in her head 




 I never had to use my hood. You ain't doin it right 




 Since it's winter where I'm from I'd thought I'd post this to help us all out. After searing just do one minute on each side with heat on medium and you got yourself the perfect medium rare steak (though I prefer mine rare).

 I want to penis her vagina 














 This is exactly why I deleted my Facebook years ago and will never go back. 




 Um....way to generalize cat owners. If my cat is in the way of me getting into bed, I just flip that fucker off the bed. Simple as that. 









 LOL!

(lots of lashes) 




 shit's hilarious

 You my friend, need a little www.efukt.com 




 No. 




 No. 




 Great review! I love love love Glenfiddich 12!  




 My thoughts exactly! 




 After much thought I have come to the conclusion that I'm not yet qualified enough to offer reviews out of score of 100.  I don't know what a 1/100 tastes like and I certainly have not found my perfect 100/100. I also aim to make my reviews accessible to those who might be in the same place in life as me, a scotch whiskey beginner. Henceforth, I am scrapping my ***/100 review style and replacing it with a **/5 star review style in half-star increments, much like Netflix does. Now...on to the review...


The Famous Grouse, a blended scotch whiskey.

I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.

Color: honey gold

Nose: underripe banana, apple cider, slightly yeasty

Taste: there's that tart cider again, toffee, espresso bean, dark chocolate, slightly woody, faint black pepper

Finish: Oily, coats your tongue with that black pepperiness, finishes in the back of your throat with a pleasant burn

A good blend for the price, 22 bucks in Michigan. I would buy this again to bring to a party or if I'm broke and craving a dram.

3/5 stars

Thanks for reading! See you next time! 









 it has Bluetooth... it's just called something different. It's called "WHT." Here is a screenshot of it being paired with my friend's Samsung S3. It also has an SD card slot so you can upgrade the storage yourself. Shut up and do some real research.

 You can do all of that stuff by holding the power button and up on the volume button while powering up the phone. You can do your recovery blah blah blah and your root blah blah blah and install your own android OS from the SD card 









 it's an unlocked android 4.4 phone. How much support do you need? 




 it's better than a moto g 




 too bad I get skin allergies with silicone


 




 Horrible Movie 2 




 he killed himself... end of story. She did not  hold a gun to his head 




 I received this phone in the mail two days ago. It's super powerful. The only downside is that it comes with just one screen protector so if you screw up putting it on (bubbles, dust)... but I discovered that the Samsung S4 screen protectors fit it perfectly. 









 Didja paint.... didja paint her boobies? 




 Is your sister hot? 




 Glenfiddich 12....yummy yummy 




 NRB or partial NRB 




 by not being a dumbass 




 Was she hot?  




 Who cares... Hank is the man! 




 It'll be JJ Abrams...guaranteed 




 it's mofuggin good! 




 Dunno...haven't done the 12! Skipped right over it, I did ;) 




 THE Glenlivet 15yr

Can't call myself a cheapskate this time, shelled out 60 bucks for this in Michigan, the priciest bottle I have purchased since starting this marvelous chapter of my life.

I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.

Color: Jurassic Park-like amber

Nose: cinnamon, nougat, fresh flowers, buttermilk, custard, marshmallow, faint cedar pine

Taste: hickory smoke, dark chocolate, vanilla, browned butter, faint brandy-like notes

Finish: like the aftertaste of fine french vanilla coffee with a little pleasant burn that goes straight up my nostrils, and then its gone...the palate goes blank after a few seconds....just making me want more... and more... and more...

95/100... the most personality I've had in my mouth since my last girlfriend.

I'm getting more of this stuff.

Thanks for reading! 









 what kind of life support?  




 are they tats? 




 yeah that lollipop has the hiv now 




 there must be something in the water 




 Was she hot? 









 wrong 




 Average = fat 




 you must be fat 




 I'm sure his coronary arterial walls are "fluffy" as well.  




 Have you ever been to a code? Would you rather have a clusterfuck code with a kid resident doctor fumbling with a resus mask and some sweaty-armed tech thinking he's helping by putting all his weight on it by making what he thinks is a seal while a new nurse starts compressions on the belly button, or a team of two RTs rotating bag and compressions so you have time to draw up your meds and attach the shock pads? 




 your dog needs a diet, you monster 




 So you expected me to outline every detail of my job to you here? You lack a certain...something...oh yeah, common sense. Let me refer you to my pal [Egan]( https://evolve.elsevier.com/cs/product/9780323082037?role=student) 




 Hey! An RT doesn't just phase out of the wall when a code blue happens then after it's over phases back in. We have plenty of time to connect with our patients during treatment rounds, oxygen checks, vent rounds, and we especially get to connect with our cystic fibrosis and pneumonia patients that need postural drainage and percussion therapy.  




 wuh wuh what?  









 I'm super impressed by your ability to discern the level of compassion I have for my patients in a difficult and dynamic career through a few sentences posted anonymously on an open public forum.  




 Maybe I'm just a crusty old jaded RT, you know, the guy at the head of the bed keeping his cool during code blues ;) 




 As a healthcare worker myself (respiratory therapist) that has seen plenty of deaths young and old (my job sometimes is "pulling the plug" on a patient's ventilator) I feel this title should be rephrased to "young nurses after a patient suffers a miscarriage." An old nurse would clean up the blood, go smoke a cigarette, and then after getting the mom an order for ativan move on to his/her next patient.  




 You literally found a figurative representation of what Michigan looks like when drawn by a three-year-old 




 it's amazing what silicone and injections of various posions can do 




 apart? 




 gross 




 As a respiratory therapist this is something we all have to be cognizant of. If a patient is on greater than 60% oxygen for long periods of time the lungs can suffer from irreversible fibrotic changes. 




 Anyone here see Big Hero 6? The scene where Baymax has his healthcare chip removed and his eyes turn red..........fucking awesome. 




 She is looking old 




 A costume bachelor party? 

..............Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay 




 let's split the difference and call your answer $50. Thanks!  




 Relative to a $50,000 bottle of rare Dalmore or a $100 bottle of 18 year Glenmorangie? I'm trying to gather opinion to establish an objective dollar amount to base my subjective cheapskate reviews on. Please be helpful, not preachy, thanks!
