 Oxygen and magnesium together? OMg! 




 A skeleton walks into a bar and says, "I'll have a beer, and a mop." 




 Actually his favorite letter is P. Without it he's irate. 




 And the horse says, "My alcoholism is destroying my family." 




 Off to upvote the "dank memes" comment. 




 ... wut? 




 Well, it's true in the Antipodes. 




 "I'm doing OK for an old fat guy."

"Oh, you're not old!" 




 Knock knock.

Who's there?

Abraham Lincoln.

Abraham Lincoln who?

Don't you know me?

Who's there?

Thomas Jefferson.

Thomas Jefferson who?

Was Abe Lincoln just here? 




 There's always collecting state license plates. You probably won't see all 50 (plus DC) in one 16-hour trip, but it's fun anyhow. A friend and I once went on a long road trip and we saw 48 states' worth -- and the ones we didn't see were *not* Alaska and Hawaii, as you'd expect; one was Rhode Island, I can't remember the other (we were mostly on the West Coast). 




 I hadn't even noticed it was going on. No changes in my neighborhood, which is pretty safe to begin with. 




 At the gym, a young woman compliments me on keeping up with the college kids in an exercise class.

Me: Not bad for an old fat guy, huh?

Her: You're not old! 




 ... I've always just rested my fourth finger at the base of the thumb and it worked OK. I just tried it with the fourth and fifth fingers, and it changes the tone of the sound. TIL! 




 CC might have meant searching on text from signs. I do that sometimes when I don't have a clue otherwise. Once it got me way off because I searched for text on a billboard, which it turns out was advertising some resort town 1,200 miles away. 




 Too true. What's worse is when someone gets banned for abusing people and later some others start saying "It's boring here now, we should invite back the shit-flingers to make it more interesting."  




 Well, fuck a duck. 




 We're talking grad school after years of working, in both our cases. Also both single at the time.

My dad could help some if I asked, but so far I haven't had to. 




 I'm close to your age with a similarly intimidating amount of student debt (and I never even finished my doctorate). Other commenters' advice about income-based repayments and loan forgiveness is invaluable; be sure to follow up. I found that getting that process started helped the feeling of powerlessness ease off, and it's made a difference in how well I function. 

It helps also to just know there are others in similar financial boats who are functioning OK. I was feeling real down on myself till I spoke with my mother, and she was in basically the same situation when she was my age and now she's retired and doing fine. Just hearing her story gave me a boost. It's a tough road we're on, but it's do-able. 




 I heard about a different case where a guy had some sort of compulsion about downloading images and burning them to CDs or something, usually he used some automated process on photo sites and never even looked at them. There was some CP among the pix and he got in serious trouble. Anyway, the guy in the OC seems to be targeting CP specifically, but in addition to that problem he probably has some compulsion issue as well. 




 A friend in high school got a pot pendant from his mother who said it was a "nice maple leaf." 




 This is the main factor. As it happens the textbook companies seem to be pricing more aggressively than they were when I was in school, too. But state cutbacks are the prime mover. 




 My dad would say "Hay is the first stage of horseshit." 




 Some will play just for fun, but most of them are hustling for dollars. I work near Union Square (where this photo was taken) and I like to go watch the chess players on my lunch break. 

The way you can tell the regulars are hustling? They don't play each other. 




 Well, it was kind of late. Not a lot of people have seen it.

 Lobsters and crabs are bugs. That's why I don't eat them. 




 Why not both? 




 *reel life 




 A few years back a Starbucks opened up around the corner from where I worked, and every day someone had to go make a Starbucks run and come back with a load of their silly coffee drinks. I found this particularly annoying because the same storefront had had a locally-owned coffee shop with the same drinks only better, but they didn't have the cachet of the overdone chain. Starbucks and the property owner basically forced the local place to close. 




 Grizzly bears have claws and teeth and are considerably larger than gorillas. I suspect a gorilla who saw an angry Kodiak bear would NOPE out of there in a heartbeat. Gorillas and strong and smart but at a huge physical disadvantage. 




 I read recently that they would throw a bear and a lion together expecting a good fight, but the bear won every time. Lions are built more for speed than bears are, so their bone structure is lighter. The bear generally crushed the lion's skull first thing. 




 NO NEW WORDS! ONLY OLD WORDS! 




 But look what you did there: You said how black people should conduct themselves. We white people really need to NOT do that. I hear your desire for less conflict, but we need to work from our end of things, not other people's. What if you'd said, We don't need more Rush Limbaughs, we need more Abraham Lincolns. (Or whatever white figures you find illustrative.) See the difference? We have our own house to clean up. 




 I've changed my situation recently and haven't been having those dreams as much. I think I was feeling somewhat out of place in my previous situation, and the dreams may have reflected that sense of displacement. 




 Pineapple + hot peppers is a way underrated combination. 




 Came here to say this. Sprinkle on some basil while you're at it. 




 Hey OP, this comment is exactly what you shouldn't do: Tell black people and allies to stop talking about race. This is how white supremacy stays supreme. 




 I have a lot of dreams where I'm in what I call the dreamscape, which is similar to the real world but with a few geographical differences, just enough to make it seem weird. It's as if you visited my city once a few years ago, then described it to someone who'd never been there, and the dreams take place in the city as you describe it. Nothing weird happens, just normal things in a strange place. 




 After college I played some contract bridge, the card game. At tournaments there's no money at stake but you get to play against some of the top players. I've played against a few of the big names, with a notable lack of success. 




 In high school I liked to play chess, and one day a grandmaster came through town to play a couple of exhibitions. I was one of 10 people he played "blindfolded" -- we each sat at a chess board and he sat where he couldn't see the boards, and an intermediary went around to each board in turn and called out the move we'd made, he called out his reply, and so on. 

In this sort of event the master is bound to have a lapse in concentration at some point and make a big blunder that loses a game. By a stroke of luck it happened against me, and I was the only one of the 10 to win. I wasn't a very good player, just got lucky. Some of the other players were the best in the city, and he mowed them down without breaking a sweat.  




 Sex in which I'm a participant. 




 Saw a picture of the all-state high school girls' basketball team and thought, "Damn that coach is hot." 




 I recall someone pointing out that the main character isn't even a patriot -- he turns down appeals to his sense of loyalty and country and only joins the fighting to get revenge. Not a principled bone in his body. 




 Nah, I memorized this years ago; don't remember where I first heard it. This is the first time I've gotten to actually use it anywhere (hence its presence in the "useless" thread). 




 A mosquito was heard to complain

That a chemical poisoned her brain.

The cause of her sorrow

Was paradichloro-

Diphenyltrichloroethane. 




 Minuscule.

 Someone down the street from me a few years ago just put up a string of lights spelling out "Bah Humbug." Best display in town. 




 Brevity: Wit's soul. 




 Surely even a second-rate hit man gets more than $500 a pop. Cheap-ass button. 




 She has a master's degree, but I don't know about her job these days; she was working in a bar when she hit the big time. 




 My boss at work never deletes or archives email and never even marks them read if the subject indicates she doesn't have to read it. Her unread count is in the mid-five figures. (We do a LOT of emailing at work.) 




 "Charles Manson just got married. Why are you still single?" 




 Once I went to a seminar over Halloween weekend in a city I'd never been to before, and someone invited me to meet them at a party later. I went over there fashionably late, and my inviter hadn't gotten there yet, so I got to introduce myself to a houseful of strangers. They were all real chill, so it was not nearly as scary as it could have been.
