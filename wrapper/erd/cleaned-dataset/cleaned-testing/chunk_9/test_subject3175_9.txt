 The decellularization process, when done correctly/adequately, should eliminate virtually all DNA and immune antigens from the tissue. This means that there shouldn't be an immune response and no anti-rejection/immunosuppresive drugs are needed like a normal transplant. 

Organs decellularized from pigs have been used in humans without the need for immunosupressants so that shouldn't be an issue with this technique if it gets that far. 









 Taking L-citrulline (6g per day) can improve intense (but not moderate) exercise performance.  

It likely does this by improving oxygen delivery to muscle (so the muscle has more oxygen available to it) and promoting muscle to use more aerobic metabolism. More research is needed to know exactly how citrulline improves exercise performance. 




 This study was done on normal people (20yr old, recreationally active men with no "disease") and they did find an effect.

By oxygen uptake kinetics they referring more to uptake of oxygen by muscle and not blood oxygenation as you're referring to. Oxygen uptake can be increased by improving oxygen availability to muscle (e.g. improved blood flow to muscle) and shifting from anaerobic to oxidative metabolism and/or increasing  the rate of oxidative metabolism. In short, citrulline seems to be capable of doing both hence the improved oxygen uptake and exercise performance but more research is needed to figure out the mechanisms and relative contribution of each process. 




 A brief breakdown for you:  

1. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a kinase that is activated in response to energy stress (specifically the increase in AMP:ATP ratio). 

2. Leptin is an adipocyte secreted hormone that can regulate metabolism. satiety and can increase AMPK activity.   

3. Leptin dysregulation has been found in Alzheimer's, in particular the leptin receptor - so even though leptin levels are normal the signaling cascade doesn't occur (well it probably does but at significantly lower levels).  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23895348

4. In this study leptin decreased amyloid (I guess should be good for alzheimer's) and inhibiting AMPK reduced this decrease in amyloid.  

5. Leptin also improved performance in a maze and AMPK inhibition again abrogated it.  

As Alzheimers patients cells seemingly do not respond to leptin it likely won't help in Alzheimers (unless you increase the leptin receptor with a drug or via gene editing etc.). 
 




 Yep what you're doing seems fine so keep it up!

Personally, I need at least 2 days rest a week or I get injured (my family seem to have bad tendons and slow regeneration/recovery - not saying that you will!). I'd recommend having one rest day a week just to make sure you don't overdo it. 




 The effect of more vigorous exercise on life expectancy is hotly debated and still being figured out. Several studies have shown that those who do a lot of endurance (20miles/wk) **appear** to lose the benefits of exercise on prolonged exercise - it doesn't shorten life expectancy but doesn't increase it. This is one of those studies and is free access and easy to read.

Some of the studies are limited as the runners aren't split into groups with confounding variables (e.g. family history of CVD, other illnesses etc.). When accounting for those variables one study found the same effect, very intense exercise prevented increases in life expectancy.

The studies don't mean that you shouldn't exercise at high intensity and if you enjoy what you do then keep doing it. It might be that quality of life is higher but life expectancy isn't increased for people who chronically train at high intensity. More studies are needed to be done to understand if there is a true relationship between very intense exercise and life expectancy.  




 Definitely, I didn't mean don't do strength training just that from a mortality point increased cardiovascular fitness seems to have a bigger effect. CV and strength training have overlapping and distinct benefits. From a quality of life point of view, increased strength and resistance programs in elderly patients improve quality of life and help maintain independence. 




 For the study I was involved in it was 12 - all the patients were diabetic, all were over 50 and the majority not exercised for a long amount of time. There are obviously concerns with those patients so the lower end of moderate activity was targeted. A previous small trial at the institute had found that for those patients longer adherence to the exercise program was achieved at that scale compared to higher RPEs.

I should have put the range which is 12-14 for moderate exercise so thanks for the input!
