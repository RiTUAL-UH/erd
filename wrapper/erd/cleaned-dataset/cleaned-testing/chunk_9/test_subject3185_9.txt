 Hey deadlymajesty this is really useful stuff.  I've stickied this post.    Thanks for compiling it and posting it here.  I'll throw you a mod invite.  Maybe you are interested in using the wiki here or making the sidebar more informative or just to help you keep making quality posts.   

 

 




 Going on your title, I just want to emphasise that posts here don't have to be about battlebots the tv brand.  Anything robot combat is welcome  because that is the common interest. 




 Flying  upvote arrows look very neat.    




 Looks like a good idea.  I'd love to see some design and concept sketches from the actual roboteers or just people with an imagination.  I hope your sub will help encourage them to share.

I'll add a link to your new subreddit to the /r/battlebots sidebar .

 




 Some discussion here.   
https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3anybz/missed_the_start_of_it_will_they_have_the_full/

I've removed your post as this has become a repetitive question.   




 https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/3anybz/missed_the_start_of_it_will_they_have_the_full/ 




 I think it would be good if they companion show that goes in depth  for the details of what is going on. 




  http://vodmine.com/video/8esACo22t7X8NRVIzT3k

found elsewhere on reddit. Not sure which streaming sites will keep a regular supply of links 




 Thanks for linking to /r/battlebots 




 We have no rules against people posting links to torrent/streaming sites. 




 Hey bakes7b, better check the info on /r/shadowban  




 Please subscribe to  /r/battlebots  




 Lots of discussion on /r/battlebots 




 Battlebots is back on television soon.  Are you excited ?  
Are you going to subscribed to /r/Battlebots and get hyped? 









 This sub is just starting out and is still small.  I'd like to see this place welcome a full range of VR related discussion.  Hence we have vague submission guidelines.  We just need to get more people posting.  The mods aren't really filtering content or anything like that.    




 Thanks for posting.  

It is already shared and you might have missed it because of a bad use of nsfw tag.
https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/39pkh6/tested_meet_the_new_battlebots/

So removing this one.

 




 Now that more channels and airtime is available, it would be nice to see an extra companion show that goes in depth and behind the scenes.   









 Post removed.  Requesting users to post contact information  is not allowed.

Valve the company has a public contact address.  Use it.

Don't use this sub as your personal army

 




 Does the bbc even own it?  Wouldn't Channel 5 or Dave be more likely to bring it back.   Look at what happened in the case of red dwarf etc.

 ok no worries. I don't like it because it doesn't fit reddit rules of personal information and encourages people to investigate someone who might not want attention or a discussion about them about them.  e.g. There are plenty of people who are pissed off with the battlebots live experience so far.  
https://www.reddit.com/rules/

I left it for a week but it was slowly bothering me for the moderation standard it would set.   So it stays removed.   If people with battlebots associations want to start discussions about their experiences under their real name that would be cool.  Similar to /r/IAMA with vertification.  Maybe better to do it on /r/IAMA and link to it from here  




 Removed.  Feel like personal information from a throwaway account. I have no idea who he is and don't think he is a public figure.

 




 When a post is downvoted to 13% it is usually  either the result of vote brigades or profile stalkers.  This is because default setting hide posts when they reach -4.  So you are right it isn't normal reddit but it isn't /u/bbrex either.   

I don't really care about drama in the world of VR nor what other subreddits are doing to maintain post quality.   What I do care about is people invading posts on this subreddit to downvote them in an inorganic way.    




 All your recent and long comments in /r/oculus  have been removed.  Hence they are stuck on 1 vote and no replies.  Log out and have a look at  the threads.  Seems like you are wasting your time there.  I can only suggest you talk to their mods ,

Sorry your attempt to move the discussion here proved unpopular. But thats reddit.    



















 Thanks for adding that.  A lot of people here just have a casual interest in virtual reality.  So I hope you don't mind if I keep challenging you . 




 Nice to hear some positive feedback after the recent gloom.   BTW, you should visit /r/shadowban  




 I'm not sure how well fast moving combat works on those free live streams.  I don't find them ideal for sports.  Hopefully there will be some high quality pre-recorded streams.    
 




 Thanks for the info.  Feel free to start discussions about robogames in /r/battlebots.  This sub is about competitive robotics in general and not limited to the Battlebots brand.  

If you have a professional connection to robogames, maybe declare it with a user flair selectable from the sidebar.   




 Not enough  substance here to warrant a submission.  Hence you are downvoted.  No one knows who these names are or what they did. 




 There are unofficial websites streaming abc live internationally accessible.  

http://www.time4tv.com/2013/08/abc.php

http://www.stream2watch.com/live-tv/us/abc-live-stream

(best with ad block)
 




 We can only hope that they will learn from their mistakes and the feedback.  It isn't much effort to be considerate to an audience and keep them on your side.    




 Can you edit in some better context about who these people are, what it is all about and how it relates to virtual reality in a way that the average person would care.  

This comes across as a personal rant which is hard to understand.  So I am not sure it belongs here.  Sometimes it is better to post facts in the OP and save your opinions and personal experience for the comments.  This post is attracting some reports and some aggressive but empty attacks in the comments that I've seen fit to remove for not meeting the "be nice" guideline.

 The funny thing is that they sounded desperate too fill the arena and were paying groups to attend

 reddit has a community at /r/battlebots.  Hope people can join for hype and episode discussion.  Spoilers will be tagged  .   




 You are right. I've changed it.  I think if titles and comments are clearly marked, there is no problem having them.


Thats us fixed.  Unfortunately, your account has been shadowbanned by admin.     Visit /r/ShadowBan for some info on what to do 




 Hey  James.    Thanks for the invite.  Sorry I missed your reply.  Must have been under a deluge from one of my technology posts.

It would be cool to have a /r/robotwars community there and it would really work if they revive robotwars.     If you got the original hypnodisc then you deserve to keep the throne on that sub!

Half the reason, I wanted in on that sub was to update the side bar with some other subs and x-post there.   So will gladly accept the invite. 




 The new shows has new rules about active weapons so it could be a variety of stuff.   Any industrial bot like snoo could be cool.  Saws, claws, spikes and even flames are cool. 














 Hi.

/r/battlebots is a community for fans of Battlebots, robot combat and the wider world of the world of competitive robotics.

There is a new tv series starting soon and so I am expecting the subscribers in the sub to grow substantially and fast.

This could be a fun snoo to create.

Any input appreciated.

 I'm trying to figure out why do x86 emulation rather than just making an x86 chip.

Does x86 emulation avoid licencing fees? Or is is the chip designed for more specialist applications rather than the mass market? If so, why bother with x86 at all?


If I had to guess, it's because this chip's primary purpose isn't running x86 code; it's running Elbrus code! But it's handy to have x86 compatibility, for legacy software and other stuff that hasn't yet been ported.

I think an x86/x86-64 license would be required from Intel/AMD, even if it's only an abstraction layer and not a hardware implementation. 




 With this latest news Rightscorp must certainly be on its last legs. The 
shareholders' confidence was already in the toilet and this certainly 
won't help any. This case should prove to them, once and for all, that Rightscorp is run by greedy morons and bottomfeeders who don't comprehend the first thing about the legal system.

The entire basis of Rightcorp's business model is leveraged upon ignorance and can only succeed where those they are pursuing are ignorant. This particular action of Rightscorp against CBeyond proves it quite handily. Ignorance is, especially in the information age, only temporary and, therefore, the stragegic basis upon which any alleged early "successes" Rightscorp ever had are now quickly evaporating. If I were a Rightscorp shareholder I'd cut my losses now while my shares still had at least a little bit of value left.

A subpoena has no force of law unless it's signed by the judge. The signature of the court clerk only evidences that it's been filed with the court, nothing more.

I'd like to say "Kudos to Christopher Bunce" but all he was doing was what every other ISP's legal counsel should be doing -- telling the copyright trolls to get a valid court order to produce client records. But to get that the trolls must first file a lawsuit for copyright infringement and, then, under that lawsuit, pursue client records under Discovery.

Tragically, there are still a few ignoramuses in charge of ISPs that don't understand the basics of due process of law, so instead of telling copyright trolls to go pound sand (or better yet, just ignore their color of law "subpoenas") they sometimes ignorantly hand over customer records at the drop of a hat. Such ISPs could easily learn a few things from this case... if they wanted to. 




 Nearly any program can be justified 'in the name of security', but how much privacy and how many freedoms are you willing to trade 'in the name of security'. This single decision will not end the debate, so expect to deal with it as the digital age matures and becomes more deeply integrated into every facet of our lives. Think well now what decision you make lest you come to regret it later. 




 Good news for battlebots 














  Mods, please sticky this, seems helpful? 

Hey qwertythe300th, I've added you as a mod so that you can sticky and unsticky your post as you see fit and maybe help keep this place going smoothly in other ways.  Hope you can accept.  Thanks for keeping us up to date and thanks for using spoiler tags 














 They neglect to mention GCHQ having its own military satellite system called Skynet - more a name coincidence.  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_%28satellite%29 














 ok.  thanks for contributing  




 Pinging /u/twister662  - Please see this thread.   

As a quick fix, I've commented out your changes to the css just to revert us back to something that works for everyone.  I really liked how it was before and I could see what you were trying to do here with the dark background.  Unfortunately, the current state  meant a broken experience for many users.  Not sure if you realised this.     You can still make of the css whatever you want as you got some great ideas.  I only patched it because it was unreadable for many.   




 Thanks for the feedback.

You can remove the custom styles using this link
http://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots+nocss

I agree it is hard to read at the moment.  I am not a fan of white on black styles for reading .   Maybe it is my old eyes.

However, I can see what it is trying to be and it has the potential to look good.  It did use to look really good a few weeks a go and it was from the same mod.  This restyle just needs some tweaks. 

I don't want to step on the work of other mods too much as it was only changed yesterday and so might be a work in progress.  So suffer for a day and if it nothing changes I'll revert or fix it.



EDIT: Ok I'll fix some of it as we got black text on a black background in the body text of self posts!  So it is broken/


EDIT2:  I think it looked good and worked  if you had RES installed and have it on night mode.  Otherwise it was broken and sometimes unreadable.

 The way I see it, they are giving away access to their limited internet because that is of benefit to their advertising business.  It will lead to monoplies and undesirable stuff if left unchecked in the long term.  However, in the short term it is a finacially viable way of giving internet access to the poor.  They would not fund internet.org if there wasn't some stong benefit for them. 




 But who is going to pay for that ?    




 Same could be said for Americans.   




 Thanks. It is a great help 





































































 This is the time to stop mega corporations from deciding the fate of the country. The time to rise against monopolization, against the internet sales tax, against the destruction of net neutrality. This is the person you want, people. Look at Sanders' record, look at his YouTube videos where he exposes all the evil shit that is going on.

The time is here for us to make a difference and to take back the country. 

Vote Sanders.

 Thanks for posting. However, your link appears broken.  Plus it was already caught in the spam filter and so never made an appearance.   Feel free to repost with a direct link..   

  









 

I don't think people want it to be different.  It just took a break because it stopped being so fresh.  New younger audience should enjoy it. 

I hear it will be more reality tv focused .  So maybe influenced by shows like x-factor .   




 American version.   More like the later series of robotwars when it was more pure battles 




 Hope fans and those interested can join us on /r/battlebots .  





































































 Do you prefer your American TV persona or your british one ?   Do you get a choice of how the editors portray you and do you mind? 




 What do you think about the American system of tipping the service staff ?   









 Just like that film "Edge of tommorow" 



















 You're understating it 




 If they merge, they should be investigated under the RICO act, as both have horrible Customer service   together IMO it makes a criminal enterprise.  However, all Comcast will do is just keep killing people until RICO goes away.

 



















 Net neutrality fundamentalism isn't always a good thing straight away.  I feel that they could return to the question of net neutrality 10 years down the line when they have infrastructure and everyone online 



















 I wonder what extra info a HMD can provide about the users?  Trivial stuff like how tall someone it.  And maybe  some sophisticated stuff about posture.  All this can feed machine learning and recognition algorithms.    


































 I just foresee the conspiracy theories trying to paint the reason for leaving .    




 An important point to note is that the leading political party in the UK wants to ditch the European court of human rights convention.
