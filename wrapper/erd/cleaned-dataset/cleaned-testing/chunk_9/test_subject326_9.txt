 Sorry you had to go through that OP! I'm glad he got what he deserved though. Am I the only one that had "Bartender" start playing in their head when they read the first few lines of the last paragraph? Just seemed fitting somehow 




 definitely try to keep a low profile. Changing clothes and hair color are a great decision, but also keep in mind this guy seems to be very tech savvy. If he can hack into security cameras, he can also probably get ahold of traffic and street cams. I wouldn't travel to any large towns if you don't have to, and don't use any cell phones because they can be traced by any call over 20 seconds. Some can even be tracked with the phone turned off. It sounds like you dear need to go way way way off the grid. Don't trust anyone you meet in person, because anyone could be his eyes and ears in spots where he can't physically see you. Stay safe OP!
