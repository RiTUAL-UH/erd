 Nashville local here. I was working security at a local concert venue and she showed up to see the guy performing. As I walked by her one time I overheard her saying that she had been selling out venues since she was 14 or 15. 









 You know, the first thing I thought when I saw this picture was, "this has to be in Tennessee." It was confirmed when I saw your user name.  




 This happened to me earlier today actually. My brain went into overdrive and I wasn't able to answer either question I was asked for several seconds.  




 Oh yea! Went to the store and fought some people for bread and got the last jug of milk. Don't know what I can make with the two but I'm ready.  




 Jonesborough, TN!
