 I understand the appeal of siq faydez but they are not for me. Very slight wallet, whiskers, and honeycombs are fine but when the thighs and knees start going I don't like it anymore.  




 Online stock is actually reflects all stock including items at retail locations now. However, people are always returning stuff (I actually have one of these in a small that I need to return, so look out for that!).  




 Yeah, the 770 is their tapered cut, in between the 1040 slim straight and the 484. It is my absolute favorite cut for pants.  




 I believe it is a J. Crew Baird McNutt Irish linen shirt. 

But everyone else is on par. Most brands will be short enough, or you can get them hemmed by a tailor.  




 Square looks much better but it might not be the shape. All the ones from your home try-on are too narrow for your face. Your rectangle ones right now are the right width. Try more pairs that are wider (Warby's website has a filter).  




 You're gonna be waiting a while for the Oneplus Two. Oneplus CEO says he will release it in either quarter two or quarter three of 2015.  




 Everyone else's advise is solid. You really need to find a scent that *you* like, and works well with your natural scent. That means going to a store and trying a few. There are multitudes of guides on reddit (one in our very own sidebar!) to get you started on some popular, quality colognes. 

Just a note: you will be damn hard pressed to find a fragrance that lasts 10-12 hours. A good longevity for a summer fragrance is about 4-5 hours, winter fragrance around 7-8. 10-12 is basically unheard of. 

Another note: don't skimp on fragrance. Cheap fragrances will smell cheap and you'd honestly be better off not wear anything. A bottle lasts a long time (more than a year) so spend a little more on a good one.  




 It definitely doesn't need to be all that close. The usual recommendation is the same shade or a few darker. The goal is to have it look like a shadow. It is normally ill-advised to match the socks to the shoe, especially black-black, since it makes your shoe look like a boot. With a suit, however, I think it's fine. A few shades down from charcoal is black, after all. 

Personally I like to have my socks have a little flair to them, so they are interesting. I have stripes, dots, fair isle, and speckled socks that complement the rest of what I'm wearing. This is only for casual outfits though, definitely would not do this with a suit. 

You should only wear white socks while working out.  




 The measurement listed is the relaxed or unstretched measurement. I got my usual size and it was fine.  




 You can get them for around $20-30 regularly on sale. [Example.](https://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shirts/oxford/PRD~93060/93060.jsp?N=21+16+11997+12017+12059+12136+12138+12140+12318 Nbrd=J Nloc=en_US Nrpp=48 Npge=1 Nsrt=1 isSaleItem=true color_name=FAIRMONT%20BLUE isFromSale=true isNewSearch=true hash=row9) $30 on sale right now.  




 Unbutton the bottom button of your blazer, either unbutton the top button on the shirt or button it all the way up (your second button is undone, I don't know if this was a mistake or intentional). The sleeves are also about an inch too long.  




 Those aren't suit pants, so I wouldn't try to exactly match a jacket to them. A charcoal blazer might work, but know that it will never be on par with a suit.

*Edit: on second thought, they might actually be suit pants. Still, I would not try to match a suit jacket with it, since that always doesn't work. Try to find a complimenting blazer. 




 Generally too many patterns is not pleasing to the eye. To be completely conservative I'd say only one should have a pattern, though that is flexible if you know what you are doing. 

No, the two pieces do not need to have a bit of the same color in each. I'd even go so far to say that you run the risk of looking matchy-matchy if you do that. At the very least they need to be complementary colors. 

Side note: argyle pattern is seen as very unfashionable and has been for quite some time. 




 I'd just go into a local Nike or Nike outlet store and have a look at the clearance racks. They usually have some pretty fly shoes there for relatively cheap. 




 You could try a hot wash and dry but in all honesty it probably won't shrink much if at all, and you run the risk of messing up the construction of the jacket (zippers get all wrinkly, padding gets loose and bunches up) and the material might not feel the best afterwards. I would just wear it as is. 




 You're probably gonna want something that's more natural looking, such as rope or leather. Maybe some wooden beads or something like that? 

Metal might work as long as it's not super shiny. Raw cuts or slightly tarnished metals might look cool. Larger rather than smaller links. 

Sorry I don't have any examples. I'm not a huge fan of necklaces myself.  




 Nothing wrong with that. What would be the alternative? Buying a piece, wearing it once, and then selling it or throwing it away? That's just not practical or smart.

I think your clothing is an extension of your own personality, and your personality doesn't tend to change too much. People will see your clothes and think it's "you," not think you're wearing a uniform that someone else picked out for you.  




  Remember that the only person you're trying to dress better than is your old self - not everyone around you.

Damn son, that is so wise. This would be inside an MFA fortune cookie. 




 The Uniqlo ones are even shorter.  




 Yes, they taper much harder, with a much smaller leg opening. The thighs are a little looser though. I had to size down one for my 508s (though with Levi's inconsistent sizing that probably doesn't mean anything). 




 Try 508s (I think thnk they just recently got renamed to 522s?). Just by looking at your pictures, I think the 510s will be too tight in the thighs. The 508s/522s will preserves your thigh space while giving you the taper you desire.  




 Get a [shoe rack](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/portis-shoe-rack-black__0246839_PE385765_S4.JPG). 




 This is a great place for you to be! Just hang around for a while and slowly you will get the hang of it.

 I am assuming you are not buttoning up the button down shirt, like [this?](http://images.shopmadeinchina.com/9ABAACE1CDF4E37EE040007F01006991/345/6605345/VANCL-Soft-Peached-Cotton-Casual-Shirt-Lake-Blue_6605345.bak.jpg) Personally I would not tuck anything in. 

And no problem! I remember how confused I was when I first started. 

Since it seems like you are actually receptive to advice, this sort of question (and the one you had for the thread) would be right at home in the Simple Questions Thread, which is posted every day.  




 You're very welcome! Also check out MFA's [beginner's shirt guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/vor0m/beginner_shirt_guide/) for an even more depth explanation, and the sidebar in general for most of your fashion questions. Good luck! 




 There are different "formality levels" to shirt, which depend on the construction of the shirt, the fabric, and the pattern. 

The construction of the shirt is arguably the most important. Anything with a [stiff,](http://propercloth.com/images/collars_overview/pres_spread/tie_thumb.jpg) [fused](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-xkEpgwLqhjU%2FTqu_KvaW31I%2FAAAAAAAAEYo%2Ft-A4cx9Jzjw%2Fs640%2Fdress-shirt-collar.jpg imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fa-man-fashion.blogspot.com%2F2011%2F11%2Fmen-fashion-dress-shirts-back-to-basic.html h=360 w=480 tbnid=lSCjEwO6L-cbbM%3A zoom=1 docid=jIGQR7JXmtE1QM ei=1P2pVOiNDsqfyAS14YGoAw tbm=isch ved=0CCwQMygOMA4 iact=rc uact=3 dur=1549 page=1 start=0 ndsp=43) collar is going to be more formal. A [soft,](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.tumblr.com%2F5a1416dfa8808b7b436417a3cbc7c0dc%2Ftumblr_inline_ml2vwcSGbi1qz4rgp.jpg imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fputthison.com%2Fpost%2F47706678968%2Fthe-ocbd-shirt-series-part-ii-the-golden-era h=375 w=500 tbnid=YBIUFOA56l9_YM%3A zoom=1 docid=zaKMGiyUDydjCM ei=LP6pVPXEAYz2yQSA2oGYBQ tbm=isch ved=0CFcQMygwMDA iact=rc uact=3 dur=1232 page=2 start=45 ndsp=52) [button-down](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fzady-web-production2.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Ffb32f0735211e4ab58317550235f5e%2F31_027.jpg imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fzady.com%2Fproducts%2Fapolis-indigo-flannel-button-down h=1056 w=1056 tbnid=6qG0549yxQUVMM%3A zoom=1 docid=w4baNOOnx1M8RM ei=k_6pVPSJPNWqyASL-YKYAw tbm=isch ved=0CD0QMyg1MDU4ZA iact=rc uact=3 dur=2074 page=4 start=151 ndsp=62) collar is going to be much more casual. It's called a button-down because the collar buttons down onto the shirt. All shirts that have buttons on the front are called button-ups. A button-down shirt is also a button up, but a button up shirt is not necessarily a button-down!  

Fabric is the next important. There are many different types of fabrics for a shirt; [here's](http://www.realmenrealstyle.com/dress-shirt-fabrics/) a really in-depth overview on the most common ones. Generally, thinner, finer, "shinier" fabrics are more formal (broadcloth), and thicker, rough-textured fabrics (oxford cloth, twill, flannel) are more casual.  

You say you want a solid shirt, so I'm going to leave patterns out. Generally, though, solid colors and more formal and any sort of pattern is more casual. 

The most common casual collared shirt recommended here is the oxford-cloth button down, or OCBD. 




 Remember, dressing well does not mean dressing up. It means maximizing your outfit in your current situation (wearing well fitting t-shirts and sweaters, not swapping them for dress shirts and suits).  




 The Durands and Prestons look the best. The reason why is because the other ones are not wide enough for your face. Try out wider glasses; Warby Parker has a filter on the website from them.  




 You are legally within your right to refuse a return for any reason. Whether you want to risk potentially pissing off a customer and getting a bad rep is up to you. 

[Here's](http://www.retailers.com/FAQRetrieve.aspx?ID=51537) an article I found with a quick search. I have no idea if it is reputable or not.  




 Put a little water into the rice before you microwave it (maybe two tablespoons per cup), microwave it for longer than you think, then fluff and let stand for a minute. It will be as good as new! 

*Note: only works on reasonably recently cooked rice. Not five day old crap.  




 It's also occasionally called Donegal. [Here's](https://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/WallaceBarnes/PRD~30690/30690.jsp?Nbrd=J Nloc=en_US Nrpp=48 Npge=1 Ntrm=donegal isSaleItem=false color_name=CHALKBOARD%20DONEGAL isFromSearch=true isNewSearch=true hash=row0) one from J. Crew, though it has shoulder patches. 

*Edit: They also sell [normal](https://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/sweaters/LAMBSWOOL/PRDOVR~B2153/B2153.jsp), non-collab ones earlier in the season for cheaper, but they are all sold out now.  




 That is the most perfect explanation for why fake glasses are douchey. I've always been put off by them but wasn't quite sure why, and now I know. I will be using this from now on. Thank you! 




 The term you're looking for is "dress shirt." A dark dress shirt is even less versatile than a dark OCBD. That dress shirt has been $12.90 at Uniqlo for the past few months and there's a good reason why they aren't selling. Don't buy it.  




 He means a dress shirt.  




 Another suit that is often recommended at that price point is the [J. Crew Factory Thompson Suit](https://factory.jcrew.com/mens-clothing/suiting/PRDOVR~47226/47226.jsp?color_name=charcoal). 




 Look into blocking. You can form your sweater to fit how you like.  




 Steve Maddens are generally looked down upon as having poor construction. Check out this [boot buying guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/2r0fld/a_beginners_boot_buying_guide/) to get on the right track.  




 Yes, the one that is fuzzy is Heather Gray. The other two that are not fuzzy are a sort of pale red and purple (I think Old Red and Pale Violet?).  




 Just buy it and try it. Free returns.  




 Take a look at the Getting Started guide in the sidebar.  




 You're right but you used the wrong word. The correct term is "rise", not inseam. Inseam is the length of the pants leg, rise is the length of the top block.  




 Wear your pants up higher in your waist. If you don't them to sit so high try low rise pants. You want to minimize the amount of extra space between your balls and the bottom of the pants crotch. Too tight jeans will also make them blow out faster.  




 Nope, I actually kinda like it. I think it feels nice and soft like a flannel. I have yet to see whether any of my other ones will get fuzzy like this  since I haven't washed any of them yet.  

Mind you I probably would have exchanged it if I had purchased it new. But no it has not stopped me from wearing it.


 




 The one I got used on grailed is like that but all the ones I've bought brand new have been like regular oxfords. I think it might be because it was machine dried, but I have no clue.  




 You can't :( 




 The first ones hands down.  




 If your feet hurt at any time while wearing a shoe, especially after 5 weeks which is more than enough time for a good break-in, something is wrong. Talk to someone about it.
