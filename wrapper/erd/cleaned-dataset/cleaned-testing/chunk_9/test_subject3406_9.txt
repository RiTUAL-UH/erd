 That's a really interesting album! Thanks for posting it! 




 One does not affect the othera family would still need to go through and prove the facts of the case by presenting evidence. 

The standard of proof is much easier to meet in a civil case. The standard of proof in a civil case is generally the preponderance of the evidence, meaning more likely than not. Put the plaintiff's evidence on one side of a metaphysical scale, put the defendant's evidence on the other, and if the scale moves in a direction by any amount, even if it's a tiny amount, that's the side that wins.

To convict in a criminal trial, on the other hand, requires that the prosecution's evidence of guilt be beyond a reasonable doubt. (Not all possible doubt, but a reasonable doubt). That's a high burden. 

Because there's a much higher burden, if there is evidence to convict in a criminal murder case, there should certainly be enough evidence for a plaintiff in a civil suit for wrongful death. But every jury is unique, and every trial is unique. Someone could screw up, evidence could be lost, someone could be unavailable for trial, etc. All kinds of things can happen, and it's certainly possible for someone to be found civilly not responsible for a death for which they were convicted of murder. 




 Um, isn't that the argument of those in the Reconstructionist movement considering dropping the ban on intermarried rabbi? That prohibiting someone from becoming a rabbi based on them marrying a non-Jew makes them second-class citizens? 




 Allowing Jews who intermarried to participate in some elements of the Jewish world but not all would certainly make the second class citizen comparisons seem apt.

 There is no real legal answer. You expect caselaw or statutes that address time travel? 




 It's really hard getting a job as a public defender, actually. In the wake of the '08 financial collapse, and even before then in some cases, there were budget freezes in many (most?) states that prevented new prosecutors and public defenders from being hired. And district attorney offices generally get funded before public defenders offices do. (The constitutionality of which is questionable, but...) 




 I'm glad to hear that you have your dream job! :) 




 Heh. True, true. There are mornings I wake up sleepy, and for a brief moment, think I don't want to get up to go to work. Then I remember a time when I didn't have a job to get up for, and get my ass out of bed. 




 Not to be pedantic, but the witness protection program is run by the U.S. Marshals Service, not the FBI.  




 You can. It's less likely one will be chosen, but it's not an automatic grounds for dismissal from jury service. Just the other day, Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts was called for jury duty and showed up at the courthouse. He wasn't put on a jury, but he was called.

A main reason why it's less likely a lawyer would be put on a jury is the fear that other jurors would give her or his views more weight during deliberation based on the legal background. A good reason to use a preemptive challenge on lawyers. 




 I forget the exact phrasing of the question, but it was one where I did need to say yes.... 




 Thanks! 




 I do indeed have a job that I'm very happy with! It was a matter of making serendipity happencontinuing to apply and put myself out there until something came through. It was scary for a while there, though. 




 Graduating law school at the time of the financial collapse was poor timing. I graduated cum laude, passed the bar easily, but had a multiyear period of unemployment/severe underemployment.

During that period, I was called for jury duty. I went to the courthouse, waited around, and was called in as part of a panel for a personal injury case. The judge asked people to stand for if the answer was yes to various questions, one of which was "do you work in the legal profession." I stood, and when it was my turn to reply, I said I was a lawyer. The judge asked what field I worked in, and I honestly replied that I was unemployed. And the people around me laughed! And said that I should ask for business cards when I left.

Working hard to get through law school only to be unable to land a job was bad enough, but that really dropped a salt block into the open wound. That hurt.

(And no-nobody offered me a business card, and no, it wasn't as though I wasn't networking and talking to lawyers at that point. The $15 I got for showing up for jury duty was the most I earned that week.)

Tl;dr: Who the hell laughs at someone being unemployed? 




 I'll also recommend Bookstore Movers. They won Washington City Paper's best movers in the DC area 5 years in a row, and when I used them a year and a half ago, the concierge at my building took me aside to say that he had never seen a moving crew work that quickly and carefully. Nice people, easy process, I was thrilled with how my move went. 




 Sigh. I did not say that the airline pulled her off the plane because they were afraid her condition was contagious. The two sentences were separate.

And regardless of whether they pulled her off the plane because they didn't want her dying on the flight or needing medical attention, one of the goals of the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Air Carrier Access Act was to destigmatize people with disabilities and not allow myths and fears to dictate how people with disabilities are treated. An airline cannot require a cancer patient to prove an eligibility to fly-such a barrier violates 14 C.F.R. 382.31. 




 Cancer isn't a communicable disease, for pete's sake. Isn't what occurred here a blatant violation of the Air Carrier Access Act and 14 C.F.R. 382? 14 C.F.R. 382.31 prohibits carriers from refusing service to people with disabilities solely on the basis of said disability, and cancer is certainly something that impact many daily life activities.

 How many times has Israel tried to cut a deal, only for the Palestinians to walk away? Hell, in 2000, the Palestinian Authority was offered 100% of Gaza, 92% of the West Bank, 3% of Israeli territory adjacent to Gaza, and control over East Jerusalem including most of the Old City. The Palestinian Authority walked away and launched an official campaign of terror attacks two months later.

I don't support Netanyahu. I don't support settlement building. I don't support Likkud. And I think there are steps both sides, Israeli and Palestinian, must take to try rebuilding trust, even if it is from scratch.

But it's absurd for this article to claim that it's Netanyahu that has all but killed a two party solution, and not every inch as much the Palestinian side repeatedly backing away from getting nearly everything it wanted in an agreement. 




 Sure! I'd be curious. 




 Seems to depend on whom you ask (see http://wtop.com/arlington/2015/03/pentagon-city-mall-and-shopping-center-evacuated/ which says both), but I think you're right, that it's the costco/best buy area.
 




 Which mall did they actually close? Some said it's the Fashion Center at Pentagon City (the big mall), some have said it's the strip mall across the street (with the Costco, Best Buy, CPK, Chevys, etc.), and some have said both. Does anyone know which it actually is? 




 It seems unclear what has actually been shut down? Is it the Fashion Center at Pentagon City (the big mall) or is it the shops/costco/CPK block across the street? 




 It's worth noting that this case is probably mooted by the 2008 amendments to the ADA. The amendments broadened the definitions what constitutes a disability, by expanding the definition of who is disabled to include temporary disabilities, as well as by expanding the list of major life activities that, if one is unable to perform, would constitute a disability. Such activities include bending, lifting, standing, etc., all things that would have impacted Young had her case been brought under the ADA as amended.

EDIT: I should have been more clear and said that this case's IMPACT is probably mooted by the ADA as amended. It still matters for Young, and for any others with similar cases in the court system that predates the '08 amendments. 




 *nods* That's been my experience. 




 Bitcoin offers anonymitynot something that's a positive feature when it comes to people giving strangers access to their home.

 Good for you. Far too many people would have ignored that, or backed down. I'm glad you helped protect those kids. 




 To copy and paste what I put in yesterday's /r/worldnews thread on this subject (http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2zovxs/israel_only_nation_condemned_in_un_for_womens/):
"It gets better. Iran, where the constitution prohibits female judges, where accused adulterers are stoned to death, where every female presidential candidate in their last election was disqualified, and where a woman was executed by hanging in October for fighting back against the man who tried to rape her, is an elected member of the UN Commission on the Status of Women.

Sudan, which has no minimum age of consent for sex, allows marriage at age 10, and where 88% of women under 50 have undergone female genital mutilation, is currently a vice-chair of the UN Commission on the Status of Women." 




 It was definitely plagiarism... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYiEesMbe2I 




 Yep-as someone with a shoulder injury that used to be a hell of a lot worse pre-physical therapy (I knew I was in trouble when raising my arm to change channels on the remote was painful), I had a lot of trouble on the metro for a while. People were pissy about me using the priority seats, but I also couldn't stand and hang on to the railingone arm didn't have the strength and the other I couldn't raise above my head from the injury. 




 A bigger problem with thisthey aren't referring to people in Congress who can actually affect U.S. economic performance. They're proposing linking the salary of federal employees, not members of Congress, to U.S. economic performance, so a policy analyst for the U.S. Department of Agriculture gets a paycut if Congress screws up the economy. 'Cause clearly it's the fault of the wheat expert.

 A few days ago, there was a link to an article indicating a likelihood that John H. Jackson would be charged: http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2z32cd/more_than_a_decade_after_tx_inmate_cameron_todd/ 

Whelp, apparently he has been charged with misconduct by the TX Bar. 









 There has not been any word-the U.S. Department of Justice is supposedly still investigating. 




 Is there anything more Jewish than that? 




 No, he hasn't seen that before since I just wrote it. No copying or pasting involved. Food and Drug law is one of my passions, and the regulatory status of supplements in the U.S. is atrocious. 




 Doctors hate over the counter weight loss supplements because there is no requirement that such supplements demonstrate that they are safe or effective before hitting the market. Thanks to the supplement industries' successful lobbying efforts, in 1994, a statute was enacted that exempted supplements from demonstrating safety and efficacy prior to going on the market, and allowed supplement manufacturers to make health claims that were previously prohibited. The FDA has little authority to take action against a dietary supplement, including OTC weight loss supplements, before it can be shown that they are severely harmful. 




 Not sure why I've been downvoted. When I say it's unacceptable that there is still zero cell phone coverage in most tunnels, that's not based on a first-world problem sense of entitlement, that's based on the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, a federal statute that originally required coverage in the Metro system by 2012. When that deadline went flying by, it was moved to Sept. 30, 2015. And as the linked article notes, it appears likely that this deadline will be missed too.

I don't expect perfect cell service, and since it's Metro we're talking about, I don't even expect cell service. But we're supposed to have cell service. 




 Utterly unacceptable that there is still zero cell phone coverage in most of metro's tunnelsno bars. Can't make calls, can't send a text, certainly can't surf the 'net. The latter is an inconvenience, but the first two are major safety issues. When the DC Fire Dept.'s radios didn't work during the L'Enfant Plaza smoke fiasco, they used their cell phones to communicate with the outside world. Had the train been stuck just a little further into the tunnel, there wouldn't have been cell service. 









 (I should hastily note that I'm not one of those self-diagnosing sort of people, mind youI ask questions based on what comes up in a search, not assume that is what something is.) 




 Thank you very much. :) Will do! (Some websites that come up when searching for post-implant pain suggest that it's a sign of nerve issues that need to be dealt with w/i 30ish hours or so, which is why I asked!) 




 OK, thank you very, very much. I appreciate it. :-)  As a layperson, it's hard to judge when it's okay to give something time versus when something needs dire attention. 




 I don't believe the gums are red or inflamed, and I don't think flossing/cleaning was an issue, given that I just saw my dentist this afternoon to have the abutment put on and the tooth attached. I had not flossed it, as I didn't have anything to floss there until this afternoon. 




 My dentist performed a dental implant five or so months ago; I went in for the exposure of the implant/attachment of healing abutment/impressions made two weeks ago, and this afternoon, my dentist took off the healing abutment, put on the permanent abutment, and attached the crown. Both when my dentist put on the healing abutment two weeks ago and when he put on the permanent abutment today, it was very painful (even through having local anesthesia two weeks ago). The pain settled down after a day or two two weeks ago.

Tonight, the site of the implant is very painful. Two weeks ago, the pain had settled to a much lower level by the evening, tonight not so much.

My question is whether this is a warning sign of a nerve issue requiring urgent attention tomorrow, or whether I should merely give it a few days to settle down again? I have no sensations of numbness or anything like that. Just pain. 




 It's not that readers of Above the Law and /r/law are being told what to think by the article, it's that most of us have the knowledge and training to know that the claims being made are bullshit. 

But /u/bobsp/ is right when he questions why anyone would need to waste time explaining that arguing about the fringe of a flag in a courthouse isn't going to get a criminal case dismissed, even to a general audience. 




 Same.... My 6+ is pretty much what I always wantedit's wonderful for reading books! 




 Which is not at all the question I addressed. That the ADA does not require every place of public accomodation to provide allergen-free food does not mean that food allergies cannot be covered as a disability under the ADA.

Quoting what I said in my first post, "Generally, post the 2008 amendments, people with food allergies of a certain severity have been found to be disabled for the purpose of the statute, and so failing to make reasonable accommodations for a person with food allergies may be actionable." The Lesley Agreement was an instance where people with food allergies of a certain severity were found to be covered by the ADA's definition of disability, and the DOJ argued that Lesley's failure to make reasonable accommodations was actionable.

EVERYTHING in the area of disability law is contextual, and will depend upon the facts. Hell, the same can pretty much be said of most areas of law, for that matter. Not all allergies rise to the level of being a disability. Even the most severe of allergies may not require anyone make accommodations. And it is unclear whether a restaurant serving the general public is never required to make any modifications. If the only modification required is to saut something in olive oil instead of butter, the olive oil is right there in the kitchen, it doesn't require a special pot or pan, etc., it is possible that eventually, caselaw might develop that a restaurant is required to do what it reasonably can to accommodate such a person. If someone is so allergic to nuts that they cannot eat anything from a kitchen that cooks with nuts regularly, I doubt that restaurant will ever be required to do anything for such a person. But again, caselaw in this area is new, and it's developing.

I'd point you to this part of the ADA.gov's website as an example: http://www.ada.gov/reachingout/lesson11.htm "It is reasonable to provide some extra assistance to a customer with a disability when needed, even during busy periods when other customers are waiting...A customer with a food allergy may ask a restaurant if it is possible to omit a sauce or ingredient from a dish he or she wishes to order. When it is easy to do, the request should be honored." 




 This is pretty much exactly right. Sorry /u/ceronn , but it's not quite accurate to say that food is never part of the ADA. Under the 2008 amendments to the ADA, designed to reverse the narrow construction courts gave to the ADA, even episodic disabilities are protected, if they rise to the level of impacting a major life activity or function, including breathing and eating.

The ADA DOES cover allergies in some respects, and a lot of people in the thread have gotten this wrong. It does not require restaurants to make major alterations to their food. It is untested as to whether restaurants would have to make reasonable modifications to their food and if so, what reasonable modifications would look like. (I suspect that restaurants would NOT be required to make modifications, but I'm noting the lack of caselaw on this yet. It is undoubtedly coming.) 




 No, that is not true. See this Q A by the Department of Justice based on a settlement with Lesley University in 2013: http://www.ada.gov/q a_lesley_university.htm First question: "Is a food allergy considered a disability under the ADA?"

The answer: "It depends. A disability as defined by the ADA is a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, such as eating. Major life activities also include major bodily functions, such as the functions of the gastrointestinal system. Some individuals with food allergies have a disability as defined by the ADA - particularly those with more significant or severe responses to certain foods. This would include individuals with celiac disease and others who have autoimmune responses to certain foods, the symptoms of which may include difficulty swallowing and breathing, asthma, or anaphylactic shock."

Food allergies are not always covered by the ADA as amended in 2008, it has to rise to a certain level of severity (it has to interfere with a major life function, like eating, learning, breathing, etc.), but they most certainly can be. This doesn't mean a restaurant has to go to extraordinary lengths to accommodate a person with a food allergy, the situation at Lesley University involved a mandatory meal plan that students HAD to purchase, so it's different from a restaurant, but it's incorrect to say that people with allergies are only protected if they are in primary and secondary school, or would go in to anaphylactic shock, etc. The outer limits of the protections are mostly untested, as the amendments were still relatively recent and it takes time for such cases to wend their way to courts of appeal. 




 This is positively, absolutely, 100% not true. The 2008 amendments did not limit anything to an age group, nor did it explicitly involve allergies, making your statement doubly untrue. Instead, it broadened the definition of who could be considered disabled under the ADA, reversing a string of Supreme Court decisions that had narrowed said definition. Under the ADA as originally enacted in 1990, it was almost impossible for an allergy to be considered a covered disability, so long as the food allergy was an avoidable substance. After the amendments, under 12012(4)(D), "An impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active." Breathing is a major life activity. Eating is a major life activity.

There is limited caselaw on the subject, as it takes time for litigation to work its way up to the circuit courts that include the ADA as amended (the amendments were not retroactive), but I can point people to the U.S. Department of Justice's settlement agreement with Lesley University, http://www.ada.gov/q a_lesley_university.htm . There was a Court of Appeals of Iowa case, not decided under the ADA but decided under an Iowa statute that is functionally similar to the ADA and gets its standards from the ADA, in which the court held the statute was violated when a day care center refused to admit a child due to her nut allergy (Knudsen v. Tiger Tots Community Care Center, No. 12 0700, 2013 WL 85798 (final publication decision pending as of the last time I looked), (Iowa Ct. App. Jan. 9, 2013)).

The long and short of it is that it is insane that you've been upvoted and I've been down voted based on people not liking the truth. I'm not advocating whether it's good or bad for allergies to covered, I'm not saying that the person who screamed at your niece's manager was right that the ADA required the restaurant to do anything, nor am I saying that the items in that card are necessarily an ADA issue either.

But you said "[f]ood allergies/sensitivities are not covered by the ADA" (random capitalization removed). That is simply not true. It's also not true that the amendments apply only to children, it's not true that the protections don't apply in public, and it's not necessarily true that the items on that card are not in the category of a disability. It's not a question of what the allergy is, it's a question of severity and whether it limits a major life activity. Which still doesn't mean a restaurant has to accommodate it, particularly if it can't. But again, that's a different question.

You are speaking out of your windy backside. I am speaking based on knowledge of the statute and caselaw. In the Q A I linked to about the Lesley University settlement, the very first FAQ is "Is a food allergy considered a disability under the ADA?". The answer: "It depends. A disability as defined by the ADA is a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, such as eating. Major life activities also include major bodily functions, such as the functions of the gastrointestinal system. Some individuals with food allergies have a disability as defined by the ADA - particularly those with more significant or severe responses to certain foods. This would include individuals with celiac disease and others who have autoimmune responses to certain foods, the symptoms of which may include difficulty swallowing and breathing, asthma, or anaphylactic shock."

Or, as I said originally and was downvoted for, yes, under some circumstances, food allergies can be covered as a disability under the ADA as amended. 




 Prior to 2008, you would likely have been right that food allergies were not covered by the ADA, but, under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), sometimes referred to the ADA as amended, food allergies CAN be covered. The ADAAA broadened the categories of people with disabilities. Generally, post the 2008 amendments, people with food allergies of a certain severity have been found to be disabled for the purpose of the statute, and so failing to make reasonable accommodations for a person with food allergies may be actionable.

 Because heaven forfend people in Oklahoma hear about some of the bad things the US has done, like the Trail of Tears. What possible relevance could that have for Oklahomans? 




 But again, where would you put the cars? Not enough space on the alternate side, the same problem of snow (and people ready to kill you if you take their space) on every block, and many people lack driveways. 




 It's not as though there is a different street where there is no snow! 




 Not possible. It's not like street cleanings when you can pop around the block to a free neighboring street, and when some people are out at work. There's snow everywhere, and almost everyone is stuck at home. 




 No-where are they supposed to go? These are residential neighborhoods, often without driveways (or functional drivewaysa steeply slanted driveway is unsafe in winter).  




 They can't-cars are there. What happens is the plow comes through and shovels the snow in the street up against the cars. Due to friction, a fraction of the snow melts and refreezes, causing the snow now up against cars to be like cement. People then come and shovel out the normal snow in front of/behind their car, AND have to cover the cement-like snow/sludge that's up against the side of their cars. And so people usually put out a cone or chair or broken furniture to save their space. 




 Not anymore. Gotta telework. 




 ROSA has nothing to do with it. ROSA is designed to catch the cars of people living in DC with out-of-state plates/registrations. All that is required if given a ROSA warning is to be able to demonstrate that one is living outside of the District: you have to prove non-DC residency by presenting an out-of-state issued driver license or identification card, copy of one's original lease, deed or mortgage statement and a current utility bill (issued within 60 days) representing the same address and the valid registration card for the vehicle in question. (See http://dmv.dc.gov/service/registration-out-state-automobiles-rosa)

Whether one works in DC is irrelevant for ROSA. All that matters is whether one lives in DC.

 Freeplay sent one of their extortion-like demand letters to a computer user group I'm on the board of. It was for a video posted three or four years prior that used one of Freeplay's track as a background music. We researched the track, and our understanding is that it was provided as royalty-free music by a major computer technology company and that at the time, the terms of service allowed for non-commercial use of the track. As far as we could tell, at some point, Freeplay changed their terms of service and tried going after us.

Thankfully, after we contacted the technology company, the technology company interceded on our behalf, and Freeplay went away!

Can any of you help us do better? It's in West Roxbury.

It's a 100+ year old house, my parents have been there for 40ish years, and never had an ice dam problem before. Not even in '78.

Apparently, there's 9' of snow in the front yard and my parents are not of an age where they could shimmy up a ladder to deal with this, even if there wasn't snow.

 Sometimes the action can get intense. Austin recalled an incident a few years ago in which he and a federal marshal confronted a vendor suspected of having counterfeit goods at a cafe at The Venetian. As we were serving him, he decided to bolt, Austin said. The instinctive reaction of the marshal who was with me at the time was to stop him. He tackled him and handed him the papers and said, Youre served. That was the coolest.


Wouldn't that be an assault, violation of civil rights under color or title of law, etc.? Someone serving civil papers, even a federal law enforcement agent, doesn't have the authority to use force to serve papers, no?

I would like to ask you how you came to be an activist, and whether you have found it difficult to balance a movie/TV career with fighting for the causes you believe in? (Both in terms of time, as well as in concerns that doing one might damage the other?) 




 That's a good ideaI'll look into that, thanks! 




 Funny timing for this to pop up in my feedI've been thinking about a chest freezer for the past few days.

Question, thoughare you concerned about damage to carpeting if something goes wrong and it leaks (be it mechanical fault, or a power outage, or...?) The fridge/freezer in my kitchen is on a hard, uncarpeted floor, and I'm a bit worried about putting a chest freezer on the living room carpet.

 My understanding is that Dartmouth does its best to offer every student an alumni interview. It's not random nor is it a sign that you are on the edge as a possible student.

Every interviewer is differentthere's no standard set of questions they ask. But interviewers aren't there to look at your GPA or SAT or ACT scoresthose are numbers the Admissions Office already has. Instead, interviewers are trying to determine whether you're a good fit for the College and whether the College is a good fit for you. Are you intellectually curious? Are you involved in activities? Are you a decent human being? Etc.

At some point after the interview, the interviewer will fit out a narrative form and submit it to the Admissions Office. What weight does this form have? In my experience, not all that much. I've interviewed candidates I've absolutely loved and I wanted them to go to Dartmouth but they didn't get in, and there have been one or two candidates I thought were weak who did get in. But there are definitely times where a nudge in one direction or the other from a good or terrible interview can make the difference between getting in, deferral, and/or not rejection.

The interview should also be an opportunity for you to ask an alum questions about Dartmouth (and not just have them ask questions of you). Whether you want to know more about a particular major, or the Greek system, or research opportunities, or studies abroad, etc., it's a great chance to ask 1 on 1 questions. (Of course, you should also feel free to ask such questions here.)

Good luck with the process! 









 Part of the beauty of mitzvot is the effect they have on the person who does them. Freundel's actions certainly ruined that effect for his victims, and as discussed below, he negatively impacted the mikvah for people in other Jewish communities too. 




 He most certainly hasn't done teshuvah. Part of teshuvah is correcting the sin as much as possible. Freundel's acts harmed many, including the synagogue itself. Freundel's refusal to vacate the synagogue-owned residence adds on to the harm he has done to the shul. Far from committing repentance, he is continuing to knowingly and intentionally harm others. 




 I've only used an Anova, but my understanding is that the Anova is cheaper, more versatile (because you can clip it to whatever size cooker you want), it circulates water, and it is smaller to store. The same could be said of most stick-style sous vide devices.

 Thanks! I think this is what I will do.
 




 Thank you! :) That makes sense. 




 Thank you! :-) 




 Indeed. For all the complaints from anti-Israel people that Israel is an "apartheid state", Israel allows freedom of worship, including Islam. Whereas attempts at sharing sites that are holy to both Jews and Muslims is all too often met with violence from Palestinians. Hell, Ariel Sharon setting foot on the Temple Mount was claimed to be the reason for the 2nd intifada.

For that matter, Egypt just banned a Jewish festival at the tomb of Rabbi Yaakov Abuhatzeira in the Beheira province. http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-egypt-jewish-shrine-20150118-story.html 




 Hopefully this is an appropriate place to ask this question. My girlfriend and I read that Iceland abolished the letter seta in 1973, but our google skills have failed us in finding out why. 

Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_orthography) says that when seta was abolished in 1973, it was only being used as "an etymological detail", but frankly, we don't understand what that means.

Can anyone explain why seta was abolished, solely to satisfy our curiosity? Thanks! 




 Hi all. Having been bitten by the baking bug lately, I've been making lots of breads, cakes, cookies, brownies, etc. to the point where it would make sense for me to buy a 25 pound bag of flour from Costco for $7.79 instead of a 5 pound bag at the grocery store for around $4.50, a 25 pound bag of sugar for $10.49, etc. 

BUTI don't want bugs, I don't want flour to go rancid, etc. Any suggestions on where I can find economical (if it's too pricey, it'll take a long time for me to recoup it from Costco savings!), airtight containers that can hold 25lb bags of flour, sugar, etc.? (Should I be looking at a restaurant supply store for a cambro, or a pet store for a 25lb dog food container, or...?) 




 I'm a kosher pescetarianno shellfish, no meat, no poultry, etc. I eat vegetarian food 90% of the time, and there are times when I will ask about vegetarian options, or say I am vegetarian, because most people a: don't know what pescetarian means, and b: have no idea what is and is not kosher. Vegetarian food, I know is safe. 




 I would suggest not trying to outdo her or do a super fancy thing designed to impress her. You almost certainly would fail miserably, and it would come across as the culinary equivalent of mansplaining as per Rebecca Solnit's essay. (http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/13/opinion/op-solnit13)

Instead, cook something you know. Cook something good. Cook something honest. Remember that most cooks don't want to eat restaurantish food at home. Here's a passage from Anthony Bourdain's book "Kitchen Confidential" that directly addresses your question:

"UNLESS YOU'RE ONE OF us already, you'll probably never cook like a professional. And that's okay. On my day off, I rarely want to eat restaurant food unless I'm looking for new ideas or recipes to steal. What I want to eat is home cooking, somebody's-anybody's-mother's or grandmother's food. A simple pasta pomodoro made with love, a clumsily thrown-together tuna casserole, roast beef with Yorkshire pudding, all of this is pure exotica to me, even when I've been neck-deep all day in filet mignon and herb-infused oils and all the bits of business we do to distinguish restaurant food from what you get at home. My mother-in-law would always apologize before serving dinner when I was in attendance, saying, 'This must seem pretty ordinary for a chef. 'She had no idea how magical, how reassuring, how pleasurable her simple meat loaf was for me, what a delight even lumpy mashed potatoes were-being, as they were, blessedly devoid of truffles or truffle oil." 




 New Jersey has a reputation for corruption too. Still has voting rights. 




 Did you have accommodations in college? If so, there's no reason not to do the same in law school. You won't be flagged for it, and you'll want to do your best on them. It may also be a red flag for the bar exam if you seek accommodations that you did not receive in law school, and there are far more distractions in a giant convention center-sized testing space than there are in a law school classroom. 









 Sorry, I don't. Just the link to the article. Googling it came up with more articles, but not the opinion. 




 You might want to check out the Oval Room. I was there for Thanksgiving and was very impressed. The RW menu looks pretty good. 




 There is no right to tamper with a jury. 




 Not a new issue. In 2005, the Illinois Appellate Court ruled that when a male lover "delivered' his sperm, it was a gift  an absolute and irrevocable transfer of title to property from a donor to a donee...There was no agreement that the original deposit would be returned upon request." In that case, a woman used the product of oral sex to inseminate herself without the consent or knowledge of her sexual partner, and later sought child support.

The court held that the male's lawsuit counts for fraud and theft could not be sustained because she did not steal the sperm-it was freely given to her, but also held that the male could sue for emotional distress based on the woman's extreme and outrageous conduct.

 Not exactly truegrape products are allowable, but they have to be certified kosher and follow certain restrictions to be kosher. But there is most certainly kosher wine vinegar, grape jelly, etc. 




 Technically speaking, New York City water is neither kosher nor vegan. There are tiny microscopic copepods (tiny shrimp) inside them. Most vegans and observant Jews still drink up.

There is a tolerance level, that different people set at different levels. Vegans may set it at one level, some kosher certifying organizations may set it at another level, and other kosher certifying organizations might be stricter or more lenient than that. And so, as stated earlier,  not every person who keeps kosher accepts/trusts every kosher authority. 




 It's not that it has to be the "right kind" of kosher so much as certain kosher certifying organizations are not trusted. Not all certifying organizations are created equalis it a well known organization the Orthodox Union or Star-K or is it some local rabbi doing certifications on his own?

And as for /u/xb10h4z4rd 's comment, being vegan isn't good enough for some Jews who rely on Kosher auditors to ensure that restaurants are actually vegan and not slipping meat or dairy into products in the back kitchen; and also, bugs are not kosher and some religious Jews require a certain level of checking to ensure that the produce is bug free. Again, something a kosher certifying organization would inspect. 




 Some of the people commenting below think this is an easy answerthat Cassandra's parents are wrong that chemo is bad, that they taught Cassandra that science is bad, and that, as /u/cenobyte put it, "the government is just stepping in for parents that are refusing to be ethical and logical." Maybe. But the kid is less than a year away from being able to make that choice herself. We don't allow adults to commit suicide except for a few states that allow it for terminal conditions. And yet we would allow Cassandra to choose not to take chemo if she were an adult.

Several people have made arguments best summed up by /u/CatalyticDragon, that "children don't generally have the right to make decisions of this nature," but judges tend to give more deference to the choices of someone so close to adulthood than to an 8 year old. Cassandra isn't an adult but she's not a child, either. Does less than a year make that big a difference in one's capacity to make a reasonable choice about one's own medical treatment? I'm not convinced. And Cassandra's mother is an adult, and the state has ignored her decision to agree with Cassandra, so, if the only argument is age, Cassandra's mother should have been able to make the choice. But of course it goes beyond age.

Legally, what happened is what the law dictates. As a matter of moral philosophy, I'm not sure its congruous to force someone over the age of 17 to undergo chemotherapy against her will and the will of her parents, while allowing someone over the age of 18 to refuse.
