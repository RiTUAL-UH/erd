 I hate being on planes. I hate it so much. Not becuase I'm scared of flying, I'm not. But becuase everytime it lands or take of I always think to myself the moment it shakes the most "If it crashes now I am alright with that". I don't want to be in fear or panic when I die so I just want it to end fast, like an airplane crash. I hate myself for being alright with dying with so much to live for and not even being close to doing things I would like to do. 




 Reality is cruel, brutal and blue. Go to sleep and find your world come true. Light of day and the moon at night, they never seem to go away. The world seems dead and gray. Washed out in the dead of night. Find your love, your heart and soul. For tomorrow the day is still, just as true.  




 And...me? 




 Yes and no. When I'm out or with friends I can be really happy and be enjoying things. But when I come home all of that falls apart and I usually isolate myself and sit in my basement. I have a terrible feeling  that someday soon I wont even enjoy being with people that don't suck.
