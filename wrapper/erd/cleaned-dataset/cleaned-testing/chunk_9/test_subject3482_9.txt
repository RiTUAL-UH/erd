 Start simple. and start tangible.

I highly recommend ditching Java and starting with a web framework like RoR or Php Yii. They are quick, you can make a fun web app and get the hang of MVC. That way you learn a little bit of front end and a little bit of back end. You'll have time in college to get more depth, but start out with breadth. 

Build a simple blog tutorial to start (there are tons), get familiar with mysql or sqlite and get your hands wet with a linux dev environment. 

That should take you a month tops. Then you can start tinkering with specific areas. Maybe customize a wordpress blog yourself. Or maybe plug into some APIs like Twitter and see if you can make something interesting. 

And then head over to odesk / upwork and do a little bit freelance work. Php / RoR skills are sought after and you can start low (~$10-15 / hr and work your way to $30-40 / hr if you are good)

Good luck. 





























 yes, mention it BUT:
- be careful of the space it takes up
- customize your resume for the two different jobs. So for the software job, talk about your hardware startup but describe a sentence or two on any embedded software / drivers / etc that you may have worked on to make the solution work. i.e., describe it as a solution as opposed to hardware
- For the audio hardware job, give that more room - make it front and center and go into the technologies in more detail. 




 I agree with medical transcriptionist over front desk assistant. But it doesnt pay very well and you don't need a college degree to do it. 

My suggestion is to look for a clinical role or a junior finance role at a (large) healthcare organization. That will generally be a structured position with a lot of guidance, let you work without a ton of client interaction, and have a career path where if you get good at what you do, you can get senior and see a path to making decent money.

Something like this job: https://xerox.taleo.net/careersection/xerox_shared_external_portal/jobdetail.ftl?job=15018289 lang=en

You could even look at entry-level research / library management jobs.

Or look at underwriter / financial analyst jobs. Like this job:

Hope that helps. 

  




 Look for entry level clinical jobs at big biotech / pharma cos. A biochemistry background can be really helpful and a path to either a scientific career or a business one. Your research experience will come in handy as well. Those jobs pay well out of the gate and have great career prospects as you build experience.

Look at some jobs here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/medicine-maker

Jobs like clinical trial support specialists would be a good starting point given your background and experience. You have a good GPA so that will help too.

You could also apply for research assistant jobs at companies / research labs:
http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=research+assistant SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=

These are good places to build some scientific lab experience and again gives you a path to either go to graduate school or enter pharma. These jobs don't pay as well though

 Thanks will do. Am sensitive to cross posting because every now and then a user flags me for spamming and that's not my intention. 

Separately - the site has a lot of curated marketing channels cut different ways: http://tapwage.com/?field=%5B13%5D

If you follow the channels you like, you can be updated with new jobs since the channels are updated daily. 

Hope that helps! 




 These are curated, daily-updated channels that are extensively filtered for fake / spammy jobs. Glad you found it useful.  




 Thank you! Will check all these out. I love this subreddit.  




 Thanks for those tips. I have gotten into Passenger recently but haven't noticed the trumpets. I do like Iron   wine but they are always so sad.  




 I recently discovered the band Beirut. Blew me away. I love Elephant Gun, East Harlem, and so many other songs of theirs. So three questions for the community:
a) What's your favorite Beirut song?
b) Are there other bands like them that combine the trumpet / brass with rock / folk music and great song writing? 









 yes. This is automatically updated every day. If you follow the channel, you can be alerted of new jobs added every week.  














 It sounds really rough that after all these years of experience, you aren't able to take any meaningful leave and sick days. You seem very disciplined, organized and experienced so there are multiple jobs that you could potentially try for that might be easier / pay you more.

Question - does "some college" mean that you went to college but didn't graduate? Unfortunately you won't get a lot of credit for that.

So here are a few choices of jobs you could consider:

1. Office manager jobs - basically looking for highly organized people. Many are open to people without college degrees but adequate work experience. Jobs are like these:
http://tapwage.com/channel/the-office-linchpin

2. There are culinary director jobs at startups and companies that will allow you to leverage your skill, but these are at companies that tend to have better benefit packages and leave plans and more of a career path: http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=culinary+director SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=

3. You could also consider becoming a bank teller / personal banker. That may be a stretch since it forces you to start somewhat at a more entry-level position. If you can get a job directly as a personal banker accounting for your experience, you could potentially make a similar pay as you are making now, and have a career path that is more sustainable and more enjoyable. You probably have the people skills to be great at it. But being a bank teller at entry level won't work since it will take you back to the $30k mark that will be hard.

4. if you like tech / startups / video games, you could try and get a job in customer experience / customer adoption. These are interesting jobs where you aren't doing sales but walking large customers through early adoption of a new technology. It's kinda fun. Only catch is that most of these are in big cities so you could make the same pay but end up spending more on living expenses.

What about something like a restaurant operations consultant? Large food companies like US foods have these jobs and they seem perfect for you. 
https://usfood.taleo.net/careersection/usf_external/jobdetail.ftl?job=15002747 lang=en

The link is just an example. With your experience you should be able to get at least a similar starting pay but with better benefits and a better career path. 
 














 Hey - firstly congrats on not having student debt, and I feel for you on the job search struggles. 

In the absence of a lot more information, I am bound to agree with the advice that grad school isn't going to magically solve the problems. It sounds like the bigger problem is a lack of focus on specifically what you want to apply to, and perhaps you need help tailoring your resume. 

Check out some of the jobs here: 

http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=physics+recent+graduate SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=

A few are for entry-level math and and physics graduates, and most don't need extensive programming experience.

Are you sending the same resume to all these 30 positions? That's a mistake if you are. Also have you had a few people look at and critique your resume? Finally - are you just cold applying or actively trying to connect / network into the organizations. Have you been invited to any interviews?

Firstly - 30 applications is not a lot so don't lose patience. Secondly - before you opt for grad school (which may or may not be an excellent decision), you need to find out exactly why you aren't getting interviews / jobs. If you aren't getting interviews - chances are you aren't finding the right jobs, and your resume is probably not up to scratch. So get a career coach and get that in order. 

If you are getting interviews but aren't making it through - then you need to get to the bottom of why that's the case.

Whatever you decide vis. a vis. grad school - get to the bottom of why you aren't finding success at the job hunt. The market is still not great for recent graduates, especially in physics and math, so it might take some time, but have patience and potentially evaluate getting a career coach to help.  
























 Dating for Dummies...(j/k)

I don't mind books whose fundamental points I disagree with (say Mein Kempf, or Ayn Rand). Many people I know read and own books they vehemently disagree with without which they feel ill equipped to argue the other side. 

I mind fluff books that pretend to be intellectual that aren't. Examples:
- Books by Malcolm Gladwell
- Books by Thomas Friedman (except 'From Beirut to Jerusalem')
 




 I get reading. I get owning. But why highlight, unless you had to direct the film (and even then it's a weak excuse) 




 They aren't inaccessible. It's just that one their own, they lack popular front-end frameworks to rapid prototype an application that you can use. 

I think if you are learning programming for the first time, especially outside of a college environment  - it's really fulfilling when you can build a real live application that solves an itch you have and is fun to use. That can be a huge high that leads you to build on the skill and get better.

It's a little bit like learning a musical instrument for the first time. If you spend the first 6 months just playing scales back and forth, it gets dull and people tend to lose interest, but the minute you learn that first tune, you are hooked. Suddenly you aren't playing an instrument, you are making music that you recognize as music.

The same goes with programming. The sooner you move away from learning coding, and start to build something you can play with, you get hooked.

Python and C++ are fantastic programs. I especially loved C++. Maybe with something like C++, you could learn openGL / Unity / Unreal and make a cool game or something. I used to enjoy using C++ for image processing (but I admit it was because of a class I took and not self driven). Perhaps you are exceptionally curious and driven and use those languages to build out something amazing. With Python - you could even use learn Django and end up making a cool web app.

But if you are starting out coding in your 20s, then start with PHP / Yii and build a simple blog. Then figure out how to integrate it with or extend Wordpress, and add little features and hooks. 

If you do that, programming ceases to be a series of obscure incantations that you offer up to a computing black box, and suddenly becomes the lego building blocks to a new and tangible universe.

 




 In high school way back in the 90s, it was offered as an elective. We learnt basic on MS Dos machines. 

One of the problems with programs like Python and C++ is that it's hard to use those languages to scratch an easy itch (unless your itch is more computational). 

These days, as am amateur programmer, it's almost better to learn Objective-C / Swift, or PHP / Ruby on Rails. That way you build something relatively quickly, a web app or a mobile app, and you actually use it. So if you hated all the existing to-do lists, you build one. Or if you want to port your music from spotify to apple music, you quickly make an app and share it with your friends. 

Once you are done with a few things like that which give you a sense of accomplishment, then head on over to github and see if there are projects you can contribute to, patches you can submit, and start picking up something more unstructured (and consequently more powerful) like C++ / Python to see if you can build something cooler.

Actually one of the most fun projects I remember (and I can't for the life of me remember its name), was this league where you could build a AI-engine to play football against other teams. That was a really fun task to do as a beginner coding project.  




 60k seems high for entry-level North Carolina software jobs. To be fair - there are a lots of flavors for software jobs and even entry-level job pay-grades are standardized based on skill set. Where did you find that number, or is that anecdotal from friends?

Also - although RH will help you and take a cut if they succeed in finding you a job you like, that doesn't compel you not to look for jobs on your own. Feel free to cast your net wide and see if you cn find a better offer and if RH finds you a job you think compelling, take that. 

In general, headhunters will commit to salaries a little lower than market to manage your expectations. What they are quoting you may be disappointing but it isn't wildly off. Focus on knocking the socks off your interviewers and nailing a great job whether you get it through RH or on your own.

But most importantly - you need to base your salary info on real data and skills and not anecdotal evidence. If you know companies that are paying $60k+, then apply there.
