 All i can say is the game is still in beta, Everything is subject to change till official launch , and even then they can change stuff I think.The caps are kinda stupid, but make sense.I suppose its holds a balancing factor as well. I cant speak from experience about the pvp, as im not a BIG pvper, but I assume PvP takes skill,especially in a game like skyforge. Only those who truly know their class and know how to play the game can win. Sure some classes have longer range, make it seem impossible to attack them at close range, but Im sure there is a way to beat them, if you're skilled enough.

 Offline play should track stats 




 It may be random, but when 4 people i know get sweet tooth after getting 1 win with all vehicle ,it seems like that is the a surefire way to get it 




 I do a little dance when I score
