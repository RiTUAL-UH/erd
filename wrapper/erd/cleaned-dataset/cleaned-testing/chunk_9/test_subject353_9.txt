 Ive seen kids smoking weed they didnt turn out to be the smartest or successful 10 years down the line. 




 When they get too personal about it. 




 Nope though that is only one encounter Ive had with otherworldy beings. I wasnt sleepwalking as far as I know because it was in the middle of the day.  




 If cartoons and movies have taught me anything, its that the mouse always wins.
 




 Well it was 2008 or 2009. I was at my parents house alone. I was looking for something in the guest bedroom when I felt like i was being watch. I glance over my shoulder to see it standing by the door. I did a double take and turned all the way around only to see it glide out through the doorway. I was shocked so I slowly walked to the door but it was gone. I dont remember going into the bathroom or filling up the tub. But I do remember being underwater long enough that I started seeing a white light that seemed to be getting brighter. Then the light started faded away in the distance and I regain my senses and sit up to find out Im in the tub of water. Desperately trying to catch my breathe again, I was so confused. Right next to the tub was a statue of Jesus I guess I brought into the bathroom and I kind of broke down and started crying. I haven't seen the shadow since then. 




 I have seen a few shadow people. One was a 7ft tall hooded figure standing right behind me. It freaked me out when i saw it then next thing I know Im in a tub full of water(fully clothed) with a statue of jesus next to me.
