 Today at work, I was doing fine till the afternoon when I messaged her.

I knew it was over. I could feel it. Today, the depression would hit me. It had been a few months. No. Almost a year. But I could see the snowflake falling in my head. I could see its trajectory, and I could see the avalanche that it would cause.

I had to be really careful. I'd escaped before. I just had to keep focused on work. Fuck. Why wasn't she replying? 

*Those are the kind of thoughts that will lead you down the path. Focus on the work. Get the job done*

Had she replied? I checked my phone and got a beer. Maybe the beer would help. I drank it quickly. Nope. Bad idea.

I needed to get out of there. I decided to walk home, but then saw the bus and got on instead. 

When i got off the bus, I felt afraid of the evening that lay ahead. It was less than a block that I had to walk. Each step increased my dread. I'd never, ever felt this before. I knew that I would go home and burst into tears. Nothing would stop it now. Except if I didn't go home.

Yes, that was it. I just had to take a walk. The thought was there, but I kept moving towards my house. I felt like I was a chained by my hands and was being dragged along the floor. I helplessly watched my legs carry me up the stairs. 

I methodically checked my mail, unlocked the door, put my keys and badge in their place, locked the door, took off my shoes, went into my bedroom, covered myself with my blanket and burst into tears. They flowed peacefully and silently, accompanied only by the sound of my refrigerator humming. I should have gotten that fixed long back.

I stopped crying, got up and decided to write this.

The rest of the evening beckons, and I have to go. Thank you for reading. 









 Hey guys..I'm developing an app for Android that can play local media (just for learning) and I was wondering how the battery usage of apps is commonly tested. How do you guys test the battery usage of your app? 

Like, if I wanted a script that would launch a video for an hour and see how my app is doing...what would I need to know to write such a script?

Also, I've been told that battery percentage isn't really an accurate descriptor of the battery usage...why is that? Is it because it drops due to every other app and Wifi and data usage and all that? If not battery percentage, what would I be using to see how my app eats up the battery? 




 Oh yeah, absolutely...She's going to get an Iron IV infusion this week and is going to be on Anti-depressants for the next 6 months...Hopefully all that will help! 




 Yup...We live in different cities, though...Will still try and keep her spiritis up, thanks! 




 Thanks! We're actually going backpacking next weekend...that should be good! Till then, though...we don't live in the same city...so I guess I'll just continue to make sure she knows I'm around! 




 Hey guys,

I spent a bunch of the last 3-4 years in a depressed state, but told very few people, and now I'm on one of the upswings. But this isn't about me..

Recently, a very close friend of mine was diagnosed with depression due to Iron deficiency in her diet. The feelings she talked about briefly, I understand only too well...and of course, I want to help

But the problem is, I remember when I was feeling similar things, I really, REALLY didn't want help from other people...I could hardly bear talking to anyone else...and I think she's the same...since she's been hardly talking the last few weeks...I've tried to let her know that I'm there for her if she wants to talk...and I've tried to make conversation normally as well..but I really want to get through to her...that she's not alone in this.

I just don't know how...especially since I can remember a time when no one could get through to me..

Any ideas?
 




 They have this new brewing system (at least in Seattle) called the Clover that makes a really good cup of coffee... Apart from that, it's quite bad. Except for the blonde roast. 




 I've tried a few cafes and the ones I like are:

1. Vivace (Cap Hill)
2. Fuel Coffee (Wallingford)
3. Stumptown (Cap Hill)
4. Caffe Vita (Fremont)

In fact, I had a latte at Fuel yesterday for the first time and loved it.
 




 Not really. The India Pakistan split was a complicated issue. In fact, India has more Muslims than Pakistan. Our previous president was muslim as well.

Not that doesn't mean India is completely secular. Narendra Modi in particular and his party in general are known to be communal. He is widely thought to have had a hand in major communal riots in 2002 where a lot of Muslims were killed. But again, been that is a gray area.

Sorry for not being able to give a concrete answer...but that's India for you. 




 If you're prepared to add a day or two to your trip, you can go camp out in the Whitney area and look for permits every day. A lot of people apply for the lottery and cancel/never show up/show up in smaller groups than planned.

A ranger told me he's always had a few walk-in permits issues...every  day when the visitor center opens. Just go for it! 

Also, you can climb one of the "lesser" mountains. 

I had way more fun on Mt. Dade than on Mt. Whitney. Even though I didn't even reach the top of Dade. Whitney was so much easier, crowded and less fun overall. Though the views are great. 




 Then you throwout everything and the kitchen sink.
 




 A friend and I are planning on a 9 day trip to Kauai in the end of May, and we want to spend 3-4 days backpacking. We love mountains and beaches and rivers...basically everything.

Any suggestions for trails that we can do? Preferably not crowded!

Also, do kayak agencies rent kayaks by the hour/day for ocean kayaking? Everything I found online only had guided tours. Any suggestions would be welcome. Thank you! 




 Middle class earth, you must mean. 




 It does imply it. If Logician 1 (or 2) didn't want a beer, then all three of them do not want a beer (which is what the bartender asked, if ALL of them want a beer), so the answer to the bartender's question would be no.

The only reason for Logician 1 (and 2) to say "I don't know" to the bartender's question is that he/she wants a beer, but doesn't know about the other two. 




 Wow! What place in Hawaii was this?

 They actually do support IOS, and PS3, and Xbox, and Roku.

Android's actually the only one left behind...Very glaring omission.

 I think part of the reason he got so "famous" and "wealthy" is that he had this characteristic of not giving a fuck all along.  




 I don't want my computer to ring, especially when my phone is silent. Ideally, I would want to stop forwarding completely. I don't even remember when I enabled it.

If not completely stopping forwarding, can I at least disable notifications? My Hangouts decided to start ringing in a meeting!
 




 According to CNBC, one post on the site says "Fast foods are quick, reasonably priced, and readily available alternatives to home cooking," Fox News reported. 

Great reporting right there. 




 Yeah I actually did post here looking for validation. New to this world. Obviously (now) both the message and this post were dumb. But hey, what better way to learn than making mistakes.  




 Ha! True true. I'm leaning towards thinking about it as practice.  




 Yeah I agree now. The way the message is written, there isn't really a point to it, is there? Oh well.  




 But I did! And it does seem lame and silly now. But what the heck. I'm quite lame and silly on a lot of days :-)  




 I had long heard rumors about the Fade on OKCupid, but could never have guessed that my own self would experience the phenomenon. They had said that one day, communication would cease. Abruptly. Leaving thoughts and words and plans hanging in the air. Even dreams, if you're romantically inclined. 

It was everything that had been said, and more. It was a fleeting glimpse of a better place. Before I could make out any details of this magical kingdom, it was replaced by the familiar grayness of our cloudy, daily existence. I could no longer deny the existence of the Fade. I could only move on. 

It reminded me of knights in medieval times. A beautiful lady drops a handkerchief on the road and smiles at a knight. He smiles back, dismounts from his steed and picks it up. He runs up the old (perhaps new, in the time of the knight) staircase to the balcony, but there's no one there. "Was it all a dream?", he wonders. He looks at his hand, and the question is answered. For the handkerchief is still there. 
 




 I see you're a gangster; I'm a gangster myself. 




 That's actually a great idea. I've been around mountains for a long time now and have never camped close to the beach! 

Any good beaches close to LA that you could suggest (that won't be too crowded)? 




 Exactly what it says in the title. I'm looking to go camping in CA Jan 2-5. Cold is fine, but freezing and below temperatures aren't good, since I just want to stay in relative comfort. 

Strenuous hikes are very welcome, though! My last trip to CA was Mt. Whitney in August. That much cold is okay, but no more!

As you can see, fighting the cold is my No. 1 criteria :) 

Any suggestions? 




 Yup...Getting me one of these! 









 29!
 




 This is the End. 




 I be listenin' to Porcupine Tree:

 Thanks! That's exactly what I'm going to do! 




 My nexus 5 shows only an 'H' by the signal bars, which is the same thing that my Nexus 4 used to show. 

The Nexus 5 is the first 4G phone I've bought and I remember reading that it has to be activated (with the IMEI) or something to that effect. Is this true? Has anyone gone through the process? 




 I'm down for something in Seattle. Queen Anne is where I live too, so I'll just walk over! 




 Yup, count me in! 




 Already worked! We're on for a hike this weekend. Thank you :)  




 I have used these (slightly changed, but almost exact!) words in my message and asked her out again this weekend for a hike/picnic. If it works out, then I shall owe you a drink! 




 I'm a dude too! Lol! Just saw that I said I'm 29/M/F. I'm 29/M!

I don't mind doing the asking out at all... I like the upfrontness of your messages. I guess that's all it's about. 




 Today's Friday. One date was on Tuesday, one on Wednesday.

And nope. No plans for second date yet. I was busy the rest of this week and am going out of town for the weekend, so didn't try. Just messaged a bit when I felt like messaging. No real intent or purpose to it. 




 Yeah, instead of asking all these questions, I could just ask myself: What would Naruto do? 

I think that would work just as well! 




 Lol. Yup, makes sense. Don't know why I feel like I'm treading dangerous waters. Jump in and swim, I should!

 




 My first post here: Critique my profile  
Second post: How do I handle dates?  
Third post (this one): What do I do after my first date?

It seems like I'm growing with this sub!

I had two OKC dates last week (I am 29/M), but this is really the first time I've been actually dating. Everything before came out of already-existing friendships.

The dates went okay. We talked a lot, laughed a decent amount and went home feeling warmish inside (well me, at least).

Now I'm texting back and forth, but it seems like I'm going nowhere with this. It's all "what are you up to?" and "hahaha that was hilarious". How do I make my interest clear? Or do I wait for a second date? 

No idea what to do. Please to help, the experienced peoples of the Reddit!

EDIT: Had both genders listed for myself. I'm only one -- male. 




 Yes, 29 is slightly too old to start learning all this. But 'tis what 'tis and gotta start from where I am :) 




 Really? Lol. Not sure why I answered No..must have misread the question....Great catch (on the adventure thing too!)..thanks! 




 I'm going to use those exact words! 




 Lol. You're right. Here I was, happily rejecting people in my theory when in practice, rejection's where I'm going with this :D 




 Thanks! My profile's been critiques already (http://www.okcupid.com/profile/pritam_ps).. Useful stuff I got on there!

You are completely right. My questions are more with dating than with OKC. It's just OKC's where I am now. I shall head on to /r/relationships and the sidebar! 




 Yeah...But since I'm not polygamous and all that, I'll have to choose one of them after...

I'm just being silly, I guess.

The whole thing's just very strange to me. I guess that's how arranged marriage looks to the rest of the world.

Who knew reality and movies are so different? 




 Thanks!

I'll get a better pic taken when I go on my next hike! 




 Agreed! Removed all the adverbs also. Adverbs are for the weak! 




 Thanks! Changed it according to your feedback. I think the Good At section is bland, because whatever I'm good at, answering that question isn't on that list. 




 This might be a cultural thing (Indian here), or a nerd thing (engineer), or something (shy). But I've never been in the dating game prior to two months back. 

It's not like I have dates lined up or anything. My OKC ritual usually goes like this: I get 1/10 replies. After a thread lasting about 6 messages, she stops replying.

But in theory, suppose I had to choose between two (or more..it's theory!) girls after date(s) with both of them. Is this acceptable (just saying No to one of them)...in the OKC culture?

I'm sure girls face this issue quite a bit on OKC...since all the guys are green, and all the girls are red :D 









 Thanks! From yours and the other replies, looks like boots (however heavy they are) is the way to go!
 




 Hello people,

I'm hiking through Buckskin Gulch next weekend and wanted to know (from people who've done the hike) whether sandals are enough.

From what I see, it's mostly walking with a little scrambling, for which I don't want to carry my big, heavy hiking boots.

Anyone with experience in the Canyon, please chime in!
 




 And someone giving aid is again admired... I really don't get it.  



















 I am willing to wager that even after losing his hand, he won't differ at all.  




 Well of course it's a pop corn movie. But it's been a long while since I've loved a movie so much. I forgave all the plot holes because of the awesomeness. 




 But even with giant robots, you have Transformers 3 and you have Pacific Rim. 




 Yup, you're right in that we both were partly right :) 

I found this: http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/bernoulli.pdf

So the car pressure is *higher* than outside, and net-airflow is actually **outwards**! Of course, because there's air coming in through the vents. Cool stuff.

Also, a hole in the windshield is the "same" as a window, because air is flowing attached to the car surface and not straight into the car. 




 I think we're both quite wrong. The only airflow is from a mixing layer as answered by 'threegigs' in a separate comment.  




 Ah!!!

That makes perfect, perfect sense. Thank you :) 




 Actually air flows out of the bottle, not into it. Also imagine an aeroplane door cracking open in midflight. Everything flows out, not in. The air outside is moving relative to the car, so actually the air outside is the air with the lower pressure. Just like in a wind tunnel.

Barometric equilibrium is of course true. But how? Why...what if you open the window just a tiny bit? Is air still flowing both in and out of there? Because sure as hell, if you put your hands in the gap, you're going to feel air flowing in.

EDIT: In fact, what happens if all your windows are closed and there's a (say big) hole in the front windshield? Where's the air flowing out of then? I think there's some big thing I'm missing...and it's not just that air is flowing out of an undefined place. 




 Relative to the car, the air inside the car is at rest, right? So it's pressure 
is the same as when it started, which is atmospheric pressure.

So you mean, part of the window has inflowing air and part of it has outflowing air? Which parts have inflow and which have outflow? Like I said, try this in a moving car...you really can't find a region with outflowing air.

Also, if the pressure inside is *actually* lower, why is air flowing out?

 




 I was asked this puzzle a few weeks back and couldn't figure it out.

You're moving in a car, and you roll down the windows. Air flows into the car. 

1. Why does air flow in? Air inside is at atmospheric pressure, air outside is at atmospheric pressure. Pressure being equal, there should be no flow.

2. Obviously it's flowing out from somewhere, otherwise pressure would build up in the car and it would explode. Where does it go out of? This was asked to me when inside a moving car, and I placed my hand at various locations around the window and air seemed to be coming inside everywhere!
 




 We don't really consider molecules while talking about the propagation of sound. The assumption is that they collide frequently enough with each other that statistically speaking, the pressure distribution is continuous. That's what the continuum assumption means. 

Increasing amplitude of (pressure) oscillations is the same as increasing the loudness of the sound, so yes...It would work in relation to your ear. 




 Theoretically, the speed of sound is a function of $\gamma$, $P$ (pressure) and $\rho$ (density)... 

Basically, as the density approaches zero, the speed of sound becomes undefined, i.e. there's no air for the sound to travel through. Theoretically though, however rarefied the air is, sound can still travel.

However, when I say theoretically, I mean in the theory of compressible flow, which assumes that air is a continuum. This assumption is valid for quite a while.

At the point where air cannot be treated as a continuum and molecules are too far to collide with each other (but still close enough for non-zero density), sound can't travel. When there is zero pressure, the speed of sound is zero.

However, whether you can *hear* sound in these cases is a completely different question, because that depends on whether your ear drum can detect the pressure variations and oscillations.

**tl;dr**: Pressure goes to zero, sound can't travel. Density goes to zero, nothing for sound to travel in. Molecular and/or viscous effects can/may do other things that I don't know (but hopefully someone does!)
 




 Dude, from the looks of your FR, it looks like she was the one that seduced you...which is not a bad thing at all, of course... means you're worth it :)

But I think you're fooling yourself if you're thinking you made this happen with your cool seduction skills ;-) 




 Thanks!! 

He's the drummer for Louis Banks...that's awesome! He (Banks) had performed in our college when I was an undergrad in Bombay...amazing fusion! 




 I'm sure the African people have their own systems of counting and learning. Just because it's different from western theory doesn't mean it's magical. The africans work just as hard and take just as much time to learn their rhythms. And they have their own version of "polyrhythms" and theory as well.

I kind of relate to it since Indian music is similar. Polyrhythms start very, very early when learning indian percussion and are never really regarded with the same sort of amazement as they are in western music. Really cool stuff. 

Also, Bela Fleck is awesome :)

 I use ice cream tubs. They work great for rice once you're done making milkshake out of all the ice cream! 




 I would have preferred a cleaner sound on the guitar to go with the clean vocals...Otherwise really cool! Nice, simple riffs, nothing unnecessarily over-the-top. Fun stuff!

EDIT: Very nice lead solo! The part that harmonizes with the vocals is quite cool! 




 From the title, it just seems like she smiles there. Who knows where she lives..  




 None taken!

The classical music is derived from the same base in both countries. Which is not surprising, considering the style of music is from before the countries split up.

In fact, there is a greater divide between North Indian and South Indian music than between North Indian and Pakistani music.

 Thanks a lot! I'm moving there soon and am getting very, very excited about all the hiking opportunities!  




 What places are those? 




 Moving to WA in August...Can't wait!!
