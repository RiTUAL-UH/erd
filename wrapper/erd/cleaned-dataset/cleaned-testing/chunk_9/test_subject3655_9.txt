 Is it just this picture, or does Sophie almost have a bit of a receding hairline line? I've never noticed it befor so I don't think so...but the picture really make is look like she does a little.

 Now we didn't! You ruined it all for your little moment of glory, it's 'finders keepers' not 'finders keeper'. Gosh.

Anyone else feel bad for Gilly? Picture unrelated 




 Oh, come on. Catndlestick but no Catservstory? It was right there. 




 I. Can't. Wait. 




 I love how perfect that expression is. Like he's mildly surprised to see the cats, but not alarmed enough to take action against it. As if to say, "Hm? Well sure, I don't see why not. Take a seat, the salmon is excellent" 




 There absolutely are. 




 Not physically addictive? Marijuana is addictive, it's a fact. Slightly less addictive than alcohol (alcohol is addictive to about 11% of the people that try it, marijuana is to 9%). There are negative physical and mental characteristics to extended use of marijuana, as well as a few positive ones. It's proven, it's a fact. I'm in support of legalizing it, but it's naive to say it's not physically or mentally addictive. 




 That time it is was time for dinner and it was dog food again. That was the best. 




 It's incredible how often this question is posted. 




 Lose? 




 Walking down the isle. 




 Niki Minaj. I suppose it's not irrational, shes completely talentless and represents everything wrong with the industry, but I'll never drop that hatred. 




 They've been teaching this for a while now. 




 I feel like there are many things I'd be addicted to if I could afford any of them. 




 Of course not 




 * The National Institutes of Health spent $400,000+ studying the behavior of male Vietnamese prostitutes.

* The English government spends about $4,500,000 annually on biscuits.

* The National Science Foundation gave the Minnisota Zoo $600,000 to develop a video game called 'Wolfquest'.

* The National Institutes of Health was given $800,000 to study the impact of a 'genital washing program' on South African men. 




 Fun fact: Even when compensating for inflation, the price for the Titanic movie was double that of the actual Titanic. They could have literally built the entire ship again twice for what they spent on the movie. 




 When I was 6, Santa gave me coal for Christmas, so the next year I decided to get back at him and poison his cookies. Somehow, the bastard found out and killed my dad. 




 "Hey, babe. Wanna take a ride on my Nimbus 2000?" 




 I doubt Disney does that, but Six Flags, Busch Gardens, etc. 




 I find lots of wealthy people are motivated by the 'because I can' factor. They sometimes accomplish things just to tell others about how they accomplished things. 




 I rephrased something I think. 




 I'm not talking about all one person. 




 The person I was talking about is actually Filipino, not sure why it makes a difference. He didn't exactly come out, I believe he went to Vijay, where ever that was. His parents set it up for his birthday even though he didn't want it. A lot of celebrities will do stuff for you if you make a generous donation to a charity with their name on it, or get them a sponsor, or even pay them directly. I'm not sure which they did. Anyhow, he said Vijay was a nice guy in general but he could be a little intense. I think he probably would have mentioned the racism if he had noticed it. 




 Jon Bon Jovi*? 




 An Acura is more than modest to a man who owns an exotic car dealership. 




 No, I'm Toby. He's Leonard. 




 Even as high as 1900 degrees. Have you ever been to one of the higher end steak houses? It works, trust me. 




 I'm not sure what to say, I'm definitely not the type to be asking about this. You know how an office building would probably have a room full of servers and computer stuff? Same idea except in a house. Everything is connected too, if you forgot to close the garage door you could do it from your terminal at your bed. If you want to turn the pool lights on, you could do it from the console in the kitchen. 




 Just an example, someone of his equal status. 




 I think it's mostly because it sounds fancy. Most people haven't visited North Dakota, they don't know if its any different, but its 'imported' so it must be better. 




 I'm not exactly sure how it works, but my best friend has a 'guy' who was literally at his house four days a week to work on his computer system. They were his only client. 




 She was more of the guest of honor. She gave a short little speech and everything. The host family was **very** rich though, she didn't stand out as much as you would think. 




 That's the point. 




 I don't know if it's legal, but they definitely aren't the type of people to give a shit if it wasn't. I've heard of people getting their houses zoned as airports or something so that they could land there, he might have done some sneaky legal thing like that. I'm not exactly sure how it works. It's not visible from the street, you can obviously hear it when it's on though. 




 I wouldn't say any of them are necessarily billionaires (its kind of hard to tell how much they make at some point), but definitely upwards of ten-millionares at the low end. It's not all that shocking, although my house isn't as big it fits into the area just fine. 




 Yeah I kinda do... My family is probably in the upper middle class, but definitely not rich. I live in like a 2,750 square foot house surrounded by mansions two or three times it's size. 




 I thought I replied to this earlier, but apparently the comment before it got deleted. I live on  a piece of land that's basically a cliff. The developers put in about 30 mansions right there, plus about four or five normal houses where they didn't have enough room for a big mansion. So theres like four normal families right in the middle of a very rich community. 




 New Jersey. They make it all kinds of ways, some commute to Wall Street, some are retired, some simply inherited it. Most of them are owners of companies, or owners of large franchises of big companies. There is even one very very well known rock star that lives five houses down. I'd love not to give up my address, but his name is at least as big as Lenny Kravitz. 




 If [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F9jXYOH2c0) doesn't make you laugh, nothing will. Simple as that.

EDIT: On the off chance you have no sense of humor, I'm not giving up. I feel as if I've been issued a challenge. People other than OP (and OP), let me know which one gets you.

 So...she was just on board with this?

"I dare you...to get in a sleeping bag with my sister naked!"

"Deal!"

"Hey sis, get over here!" 




 You don't draw dicks on the host, that's just common courtesy. 




 I don't get it, it can't work because my neighbor is rich and I'm not? It works, trust me. I basically live on a cliff where they put gigantic mansions facing the water. Where they didn't have room or land for full mansions the developer put in normal sized houses. There's about five families in my neighborhood that are 'normal', all of the rest are filthy rich. 




 Steak. Ever wonder why yours isn't as good as the top notch restaurants? Two reasons, the quality of the meat, and the temperature at which it's cooked. Most high end steak houses broil their steaks at about 1500+ degrees, theses nothing you can do about that one. You can how ever buy their quality of meat. USDA Prime is where it's at, you'll never get there with Choice or Select. 




 Swim directly towards the shark to establish dominance. 




 I'm not rich, but I live in a very very rich town. My neighbor has a helicopter sitting in his back yard, that kind of rich. People here buy some truly ridiculous things.

* Don't you hate, for example, when you get on your private jet to go across the country, but as soon as you get there you need to go rent a car? Well, people around here don't have that problem. They pay a service to ship their Ferraris and Lamborghinis to their destinations ahead of time so they can drive them when they get there. Yeah.

* I've been to family parties and events where famous people are simply summoned and show up. I count this as something they buy, because I think they are very often paid. Literally two weeks ago Laura Bush made an appearance at my friends family barbecue. A month or so before that, Tom Selleck came by for a dinner party.

* Sometimes they buy theme parks or things like that for a day. They just rent it out a while in advance and then throw a huge party. It's just as awesome as it sounds, all of the workers are there, but there's no lines. There is alcohol being served too, because it's a private event.

* They can by lessons from professional athletes or dinners from famous chefs. Sure you're not going to get Tom Brady to teach you how to play football, but Teddy Bridgewater? Sure, anytime. My neighbors kid, who absolutely hates golf, got personal lessons from Vijay Singh. For those of you that don't know, hes a pretty big deal. Rich people do this just to say they did though. They'll get a professional dedicated instructor who coaches the likes of Tiger Woods if they want to actually get good, but they just want to say they got a lesson and a picture with Vijay Singh.

* A lot of my friends have two or three exact copies of their phones in case one breaks. That in itself ins't all that expensive, but it just goes to show their mentality towards money. Who needs a silly thing like insurance when you could just buy three more? Crack a phone? No problem, got a fresh one in my pocket. Crash your McLaren? No problem, got a fresh on in the garage.

* Some times you have to buy 'people'. Not exactly what it sounds like, but say you're having trouble with your homes computer system (most people here have huge house wide computer terminals, I have no idea how they work), well then you need to go out an buy a personal IT guy for your house. From now on, you are his only client and his job is to reset your router once a week. Rich people don't have time for such things.*

* If you need literally anything as a rich person, you can basically buy it even if it doesn't exist. A parking lot for example. My neighbor once had a big party, but didn't have enough room for everyone to leave their exotic cars so my dad let him use our front yard to park some of them. Literally a day later he had our entire lawn resodded with grass imported from North Dakota. There are no problems if you have enough money, only creative solutions.

* A lot of rich people live surprisingly modest too. They're in the minority, but they exist. As a kid I used to work for a guy who owned an exotic car dealership. Even though he had about a dozen Ferraris and Lamborghinis, he perfected to drive an Acura sedan as his everyday car. Not even a particularly nice one. Even though there are better options within their budget, a lot of rich people sill prefer the 'average' things we use.

EDIT: I'd prefer not to say where I live, but I will say that one person guessed it. A lot got bordering towns. 




 I was at a concert once where a number of rambunctious individuals chose to climb up on pile of large speakers off to the side of the stage, and then play king of the hill from the top. One bouncer noticed and started ripping them off one by one. He eventually got to one shirtless guy who he grabbed by the leg. As if it was a natural defense mechanism, the shirtless man immediately turned and projectile vomited directly into the bouncers face. The bouncer lifted his hands to shield himself, which caused him to fall back into the crowd, crushing those he had just torn down from the speakers. The shirtless man then ascended back to the summit of the speakers and pounded his chest like a triumphant gorilla.

 I've had it ever since it came out, for ten days. I'd love to adjust to it, that would solve everything, but I simply don't like it. I think ten days of trial use is more than enough to give an app a chance. 




 I absolutely hate the new music app. I'm not paying for Apple Music, so I don't need that, I have a Twitter and Facebook so I really don't need or want the social media aspect, and if I use any type music radio it's Spotify, not iTunes Radio. It seems like Apple is trying to force a whole lot onto their users, and I for one don't like it. I like how the old app was customizable, how it didn't have all the shiny social media, even how it showed you the cover art of all your albums in landscape mode. Is there any way to get it back? I'll do anything. 




 Really? Good weed makes it impossible for me to read. 




 A man perhaps wanted a free ride to the wall. 




 I beg of you George, no more coloring books, no more calendars, just Winds of Winter. Please, Georgie. 




 Woah, that's one of the creepier things I've seen on Reddit in a while. 




 Dude, I do that sober.


Waitress: "Enjoy your meal!"

Me: "Thanks, you too!..."


Gate clerk: "Enjoy your flight!"

Me: "Thanks, you too!..."


Teacher: "Good luck on your exam"

Me: "Thanks, you too!..."


Guy *walking* by my house: "Nice car, man"

Me: "Thanks, you too!..."


Movie theater person: "Enjoy your movie!"

Me: "Thanks, you too!..."


Person of the slightly larget than average persuasion: "Nice pecs, man"

Me: "Thanks, you too!..." She tought I was mocking her...had to awkwardly explain it wasn't her fatness, but rather my dumbness. 




 I would have like to see how the Yigritte story line played out, Myrcella was innocent, Jory Cassel was tragic, Syrio Forel would have been cool if he was still around, Shireen was..., Oberyn was *soooooo* close,  




 No, but you can't exactly fake being educated. 




 *All hail His Grace, Hot Pie of House Awesome, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm!* 




 And then I transform again, 'the super-magical lord of shockingly convenient *and now even invisible* fire'! The small folk shall call it the legend of Ricky Bobby. 




 I use my lighter to transform me from a normal man into...the super-magical lord of shockingly convenient fire! Fuck Melisandre, can she make flames out of a colorful little piece of plastic? I didn't think so. Her followers will come flocking to me, and pretty soon I'll gain the attention of the Mannis himself. What's that, Stannis? Mel sucks and you're coming to join me on the path to righteous glory? Awesome. Let's go kick some Baratheon ass.

**TL;DR Use lighter to take over world**

EDIT: Let's go kick some *other* Baratheon ass. 




 Oh no, his hands! 




 Full? Hell no, would be like an episode. Probably won't have too many more flash backs either, it's been 5 seasons and there's only been one. 




 Lol 'the'. Singular. 




 After seeing a few of these comments, I'll do my best to keep this short.

1. It doesn't really give him any 'claim' in the sense that people will just accept him as their king, but it could give someone powerful a reason to put him in charge. Kind of like how Stanns wanted to put him in charge of Winterfell becuase he was a Stark.

2. Nah, they love the Starks. Even more so than that, they want any excuse to remove the Boltons of the world from power and put someone a little more sane in power. They would probably support his claim.

3. Howland Reed is the last living person from the Tower of Joy incident, he could prove R+L=J (assuming it's true). Bran can also see into the past through weirwood trees. Rhaegar and Lyanna supposedly got married in secret under a weirwood tree. How convenient...

4. I don't think it would be a thing like "You're a Targaryen/Stark, Jon" "Holy shit, I'm gonna go be king now", but I think he will leave the wall. I'm sure there will be some important, transformative event that leads to him leaving. He might even be forced to leave or something.

Fuck, there goes keeping it short.

**TL;DR: 1. He could still be a king/lord/in charge, 2. The locals love the Starks, 3. Howland and Bran could prove it, 4. He could leave lots of ways. He's forced to, GRRM finds a loophole in the Night's Watch oath, some big event, etc.** 




 Must be tough to pretend dragons are flying about when you're standing five feet away from a guy in a puffy green Northern Face vest.

**EDIT** I'm going to make a game to help you chose one. Take your age, add the time on the clock to it (2:43  2+4+3=9), subtract the number of items you have in your pocket, add number of letters in your last name, subtract the number of the day of the month it currently is and then multiply it by the number of people you're watching with. Then count down the list and watch that one. If you go over the list, start again from the top. Yes I know it's stupidly complicated, but simplicity is overrated. 




 Jesus that's troubling. 




 I like how your TL;DR is like half as long as the actual post. 




 His name was Nigel? Dead give away. 




 This is one of the single greatest fuck ups I have ever seen in all my time on Reddit. I thank you for your service, sir. 




 ...Why do we hate her again? Sorry, I think I fell off the band wagon a little. 




 Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought house Windsor was founded some time in the 1910's? And either way, is that to say I should be interested in a person because their ancestors were significant? 




 Thank you, French. 




 Why does anybody like the ryoal family? Completely serious question, I'd like to better understand it. I never got the appeal of following people like Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian who are famous for basically nothing. The royal family doesn't seem so much different in the sense that they don't really do much that has an interest or an impact on the everyday lives of the people following them. Serious answer please, why should people be interested in their lives?

EDIT: I'm prepared for the downvote train becuase I know people love the royal family, and I meant none of this in a derogatory way at all, but I'd appreciate a serious answer. 




 Worlds. Worst. Sleeper agent. 




 I don't get it, they all ended up the same way. 




 Ah, the classic 'New York Jets' logic. 




 I got fired a while ago, can I expect the naming rights on your next animal? 




 The realization will come in two weeks when it's relevance is gone. 




 Love crystal meth. Can't stand. 




 He already refused being heir to Winterfel because of his oaths. 




 Nights watch 




 I would honestly pay for that. What do you say, OP? 




 Go fetch the breast plate stretcher! 




 Okidoke, here we go:

**RIVAL SONS** You'll fucking love them. It's like the red neck reincarnation of Led Zeppelin, which as it turns out is better than it sounds. [Get Whats Coming] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDGtPOakEwM) is probably my favorite, give [Keep on Swinging] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ijOlAR3zs8) and [Open Your Eyes] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEZzLSPNZY) a chance too. I have a feeling you'll like this band.

**AUDIOSLAVE** Notice you didn't mention Audioslave...is that because you don't listen to them or don't like them? On the chance that you don't listen to them, allow myself to enlighten you. Audioslave is basically Rage Against the Machine except with Chris Cornell (who is a fucking incredible singer) instead of Zach Dela Rocha. It works sooo well. [Show Me How to Live] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVXIK1xCRpY), [I am the Highway] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy2ZUGc2mSs list=PLRam0XIF5Xatyny8TALt9KNuFfw592JtV), [Be Yourslef] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC5FdFlUcl0 index=2 list=PLRam0XIF5Xatyny8TALt9KNuFfw592JtV), etc. Tom Morello at his finest.

**WOLFMOTHER** Fuck yes, even talking about Wolfmother gets me pumped up. [Joker and the Theif] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySjXFjLTagQ). Stop reading this, just go listen. [Woman] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPNredrDO0), Andrew Stockdale is a god among men. Their entire last album ([New Crown] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7_foo7rE3k)) is awesome. Every time I mean to listen to like one or two songs on it I end up listening to the whole thing.

**UNWRITTEN LAW** I miss bands like this so much. A few are still around I guess, but they don't excite me. [She Says] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIDvDyro8VA list=PLtrJ2FwdCr1j7e68RTpVHgoFZeQcsb94j), [Up All Night] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azbzkeTHXKQ index=6 list=PLtrJ2FwdCr1j7e68RTpVHgoFZeQcsb94j), [Seein' Red] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq-T49MqRiQ list=PLtrJ2FwdCr1j7e68RTpVHgoFZeQcsb94j index=2) and my favorite, [Shoulda Known Better] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0JazftbEgk index=10 list=PLtrJ2FwdCr1j7e68RTpVHgoFZeQcsb94j). The singer could be better, but the song writing kinda makes up for it.

**INCUBUS** Prepare for the weirdly amazing sound that is Incubus. I don't really know how to describe their sound, just [listen] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_xjBaXor0). Oddly awesome, right? Brandon Boyd has a cool voice that really fits the style perfectly. EX, [Wish You Were Here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8295rOMvtQI). They're new stuff is pretty good too ([Absolution Calling] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTuAMlR3WuM)) although yes, I will admit, the music video absolutely sucks.

**THE HEAVY** Some people don't consider this 'rock', but I think the argument can be made. You've probably heard [How You Like Me Now?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTuAMlR3WuM), but they've got so much more left to offer. [Same Ol'] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OAkUelXoVY), [Coleen] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jDAvcBgEOU), [What Makes A Good Man?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08h0IVs4RKQ), [Short Change Hero] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1QUZzeZoPQ), I'll stop myself. Awesome genre, regardless of what you consider it. Can't believe they're not more famous.

**HALESTORM** The only thing I miss more than classic harder rock bands, are female power singers. Luckily, we still have Halestorm. [Love Bites (So Do I)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmkHqUwa4zg) was one of my anthems back in the day (aprox. three years ago). I like the rawness behind it. [I Miss the Misery] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpJAmlnBxoA) (sorry, shit quality). They also have like two albums of covers that are pretty awesome. [Bad Romance] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vmhnxVF1GU). Give em' a shot.

**AFI** Mostly known just because [Miss Murder] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMxU2ToSunY list=PLDJpDK05PqjIWYyOSkH-Jc2lB1utgBF4q) was in Guitar Hero 3, but still a pretty solid band. I like that they were able to age over time without abandoning their roots. [Medicate] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCwEBz3ego8) Not my favorite band in the world, but still has a place on my iPod. [I Hope You Suffer] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSNyOYT3dJ8).

**BAD RELIGION** The epitome of punk rock! Aww, I miss these guys too. I mean they're still around, but they're an inconsistent band. For every ten songs they release, one is awesome. But that's okay considering they have like a 20 album discography. Even a Christmas album! They kind of remind me of a punk rock version of Green Day I guess, except more original. [American Jesus] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12kcpP-8jfM). [Los Angeles is Burning] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxoD9zWY9Rg) classic, gotta add it to the ol' playlist. [Infected] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik9ofiRTTQM) and [21st Century Digital Boy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN6kCgMUjFw).

**FRANZ FERDINAND** He has songs other than [Take Me Out] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijk4j-r7qPA)! Who knew?! Franzie Ferd has an undeniably awesome groove, even in his newer stuff. Kind of reminds me of a Strokes, Muse style. Kinda. [No You Girls] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25sBhhOR4lw list=PLcPgUEOw_nvBOpnGVRkdfUbTiw1B4cwx7) and [Twilight Omens] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hi-ENlLALU) are among those newer ones I was talking about.


EDIT: Shit I didn't see Audioslave. Oops. 




 Seor Drogo 




 Okay 




 There's still that whole problem with his little oath. 




 Wait, what? That would be a HUGE thing to miss.

EDIT: Someone please clarify.
