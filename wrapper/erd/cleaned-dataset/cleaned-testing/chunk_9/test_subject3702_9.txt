 Of course what I **feel** doesn't change the actual law, I'm not trying to say that.

I'm simply pointing out how unenforceable the law is for anybody that's not trucking thousands of stolen milk crates off to a recycling facility.

I could have [one of these](http://www.amazon.com/Buddeez-MC01016BLK-Crates-16-Quart-2-Pack/dp/B00I9VP9NU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1423098979 sr=8-1 keywords=milk+crate) strapped to my bike, or I could have [one of these](http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/mgnjv8-b781049432z.120130114213840000g4k1bvr1d.2.jpg) with, say, the warning worn completely off.

Further, there simply aren't enough resources to prosecute every offender with a stray milk crate laying about. 

Facts are facts, I'm not arguing that. 

I have however, spent the last hour researching the question, reading police forums and news articles and subreddits etc... I can't find one case where an officer has been willing to cite a person carrying a milk crate around, even with the warning label on it, without having first seen the person physically pick the crate off of some property. 

I did see one kid who claimed to have found two milk crates on the side of a dumpster, pick them up and started walking home. The police stopped him, asked him where he got them, he explained and they took them, or something.  




  But we take out them, for example, we spent over $4.33 million last year on milk crates. And we can no longer just ignore that and absorb the cost. We have to go out and attempt to reclaim our crates.

And how the fuck does he intend to reasonably do that? By throwing college kids in jail? I have a milk crate that I inherited from a roommate years ago. It's so old and sun bleached that no lettering can be made out. I still use it to this day. 

If I got pulled over on a routine traffic stop while moving and had that in my car, it seems ludicrous to me that that is a potential felony.  




 Yup

 ~$90 bucks for 5 boxers seems insane to me. $60 for a hoodie is even more insane.

Thoughts? 




 No, that's, that'd be impossible, your cock can support your whole weight?

 pickling is pretty damn easy, start small and if you end up going nuts over pickles you can work your way up.

Off the top of my head: a stock pot, couple of measuring utensils, food grade mason jars, a knife etc... Pickling spices and food to pickle. 

Basic pickling procedure is to a) make a brine and b) ferment your vegetables in the brine.

Cleanliness is a must as fermentation can be conducive to mold etc if you don't clean everything with soap and hot hot hot water.

With this basic knowledge, I would suggest buying a pickling cookbook. I don't have a suggestion for you, and I would imagine that any one would do for you to start out with.

My personal favorite is pickled beets. I fucking love them. 




 Share things that are on your mind more frequently. Ideally,  sharing things that are conducive with the given outlet.  




 It is. 




 Oh awesome,  I didn't know that 




 I don't have a tablet, and I have an affinity for reading from paper.

I just printed out two articles to read because I'm super tired and sick of staring at my computer screen and just want to lay on my couch and read for a minute.

However, the print outs look awful. Search bars, comment boxes and submit buttons are all present. Navigation, archives and article contents are all stacked and have standard looking blue underlined hyperlink styles. All of this combined takes up two - three pages.

I know it's super simple to do, but I just realized that of all the websties I've made / contributed to in the past year, I don't think one of them describes even basic print styles. 

Any opinions? Am I the only person under 40 who prints stuff from the internet? 




 I'm a little late to the game, but don't try to find specific moves or tricks.

 Well, to be honest, there's not a whole lot that you can do.

My suggestion is to start realizing what looks good with thinning hair. You don't want to be the dude that's desperately hanging on to hair that he doesn't have. 




 I think the idea,  at the moment,  is that it's in  Google's best interest for the fastest internet connection.  




 I had a nightmare about this question last night. 




 uhh, yes.  




 OP probably just wants a more fundamental understanding. I think that I know CSS well, but every once and a while I read articles that help me understand how to do things more efficiently / give me new ideas to organize and write css.
 




 This is why I'm so apprehensive of sharing anything I make here. 




 Still, I don't understand why you want to do this? Because you want to write javascript like you write C#?

If you want to potentially break other libraries that your code is running with, then sure, do it.

Or, you could just write a utility function instead. 




 Why was the link removed? 




 So am I doing it wrong by having "Porn" on my desktop? 




 Nice dodge.

You know exactly what he is saying. The fair and balanced approach to news is not the best approach all the time.  




 I took it as a joke.  




 Agreed. Been frustrated with the threads there. 

But it seems like *everyone* on /r/programming hates node and wants it to fail.

Im not a node evangelist,  I just don't understand why everyone feels so strongly. Is it just because its a hip new language with a lot oh hype?

 So honest question for you /u/aars:

Are people in this field actually as dense and stubborn as this guy you're arguing with? 

If so, I should just quit my cooking job right now and start applying for dev positions... 
 




 I agree with what you're saying, but in my city, I live within two blocks of two seven elevens and a subway that are 24 hours.

All of the grocery stores open at like 6 or 7am and are open til 11pm, except one (20 minutes walk, couple minutes drive) that's also open 24 hours.

There's even a few coffee shops and restaurants that are literally open all day everyday right near by.

A lot of places are like this, so it would be feasible.  




 Basically on the same schedule... I've found that as painful as it may be to wake up a few hours early, just making some coffee and walking around the block makes me feel better all day.

 perfect? 




 speak for yourself there, guy. 




 eh, I'm assuming that this is in Buffalo. If an employer called me in during the state of emergency I'd simply say 'no'. 

DOT and the higher ups were practically begging people not to leave the house. 

It's not worth risking your shit for $11-14/hr... 




 Invalid how so? There are plenty of devs that use windows.

Just read what /u/brtt3000 said:

Windows is still huge, many serious devs and companies have workstations running it.

Look, a product launch can support whatever the fuck it wants to. But to say that asking for windows support is a bit much, *I think* is invalid. Windows still has huge market share, period. By excluding it, you exclude part of the community that actively develops with it. 




 I don't understand. 




   Also, the font.

sans-serif? What's the problem?  




  Let's assume we can make a ping pong ball out of feces.

 spin gives the projectile greater accuracy over a greater distance.

 Also bruising color.

Really awesome breakdown. You noting (or lack thereof) the smell made me smile.  




 Then don't do anything.

You said it yourself: you don't care. Live like a slob. 




 20 minutes a day.  Seriously,  in the time it took op to rationalize why they didnt need to do it, the desk couldve been cleaned. 




 This is really quite amazing. Are you a bodhisattva? 




 They are little brown mushrooms.

There are some people here that may be able to point you in a ballpark direction. 

You could do spore prints, get excellent close ups of some gills, note the bruising color, describe the smell etc...

But without microscopy,  You may still be unable to determine what the mushroom is.  




 Are there tutorials for Amy of these thing s? I've tried to do this before and couldn't figure it out.  




 dude, I'm the same way. 

RIght now I'm sitting around bored as shit thumbing through netflix. But I know tomorrow or the day after I'll be at it again for 6 hours straight 









 My line of defense has been outlined in a response /u/iolpiolp8 's translated opening statement. 




 Your Honor, this case is clear cut. 

The charges are as follows: 

1 charge of GRANDTHEFT.JPG
1 charge of Karma Whoring

The prosecutions defense is thus:

he definitely stole the picture above and tried to claim it as his own. The title is a dead giveaway. And I quote "Some soulless mother fucker put this sticker on the wall next to me at TPA Airport".

Yet, I see no admission of guilt and no direct claim of ownership.

After all, the burden of proof falls on the prosecutor to show **beyond all reasonable doubt** that the defendant has committed a crime. 

And in no good conscience can we say that this defendent, beyond reasonable doubt, has made a claim that this picture is his own. 

By the prosecutions line of reasoning, defendant /u/metalligod666 could have been in the very airport where this picture was taken. Knowing of the existence of the picture as has been posted on popular forums and subreddits, found it and reposted to reddit.

My client is guilty of the misdemeanor of reposting a picture to reddit. And if we were to attend to each and every one of these offenses, the courts would be bogged down for years.

I move that the charges of grandtheft.jpg be dropped as there is no definitive proof that my client has claimed the picture as his own.

We'll be willing to settle for one (1) charge of karma whoring, which entails a stern warming and nothing further. 




 This is the correct answer 




 Gt: gasoline_waltz

Ill be on at around 730 pst.

Im lvl 25 warlock voidwalker 




 You got it buddy 




 Your honor, I motion for this case to be dismissed on the grounds that the prosecutor has offered an incoherent argument and disguised it with foolish gibberish to mislead the courts. 




 hey bud don't take it too seriously... it's just a funny way to pass the time here. 

If there are people fucking with you just report them.

 sweet getting on right now!

I'd like to grab some strange coins, any help would be greatly appreciated! 




 I agree, nobody should have fun or apply their knowledge ever.

Unless it's to start a kickstarted campaign.  




 He's proud of his knives.

Just like you're proud of your scrambled eggs. 




 Come work a double at my joint and leave looking like that.  




 I agree. I fucking love the game, but there has to be something else to do. Maybe I'm just overplaying it. 




 I haven't bitched once about this game. But sometimes the RNG is a bit ridiculous. I don't mind repeating the same strike three times in a row, or afking people or anything. But I did 6 strikes today and got jack shit for anything useful. 

*edit* other than leveling the cryptarch and vanguard rep / marks. 




 I've had destiny for two weeks now. Playing up to 20 was awesome. And then grabbing gear to get to 22 was fun. Now I'm level 24, and I'm a bit confused as to what else to do. I've basically been running tiger strikes for the past two days, and doing some bounties. But once bounties are up it's either strikes or patrol, which get prettyy boring.

So is that it? Grind and grind to get the gear to do nightfall and vog?

Any suggestions? I kind of suck at pvp.  




 I would like to ask, does this matter anymore since the user has deleted the account? And if it does, are there screenshots of the threads presented as evidence before the account was deleted?

I'll be prosecutor either way. 




 IT'S PROBABLY FINE, JUST GO AFK AND YOU'LL GET AN EXOTIC OR SOME OTHER BULLSHIT 




 I'm a web developer and would love to work on something like this.  




 GT: gasoline_waltz. I have a ps3 and need strange coins as well! I don't have a mic yet. I'm lvl 22 warlock.I can only really play tomorrow as I have to work sat / sun. But I'm down to grind for the day. 




 Five people got into the whambulance after seeing your comment 




 I've seen them sun bleached to this color before. Also, rain and old age makes them fade. 




 It doesn't look quite like a

  I'm hoping that some day I can find some chanterelles and get them ID'd without this subreddit getting all fingerwaggling and jerky about it.

Just keep at it. I would suggest finding a local meetup / club where you'd be able to learn more about IDing and hunting.  




 Ah yes, riding the age old kc karma boat. I can't wait to find the post complaining about how unsanitary this looks. 

Quick, edit yours so you can double up. In five hours, you could have a whopping 50 internet points at your disposal.  




 I'm not sure if it's an influx of new people to this sub or what. I've noticed a couple of these mildly dismissive, sometimes snarky responses popping up in the past few weeks.

Granted, I'm not a huge fan of "WHAT IS THIS? CAN I EAT THIS?" posts. But I'm also not a fan of "Don't ask if you don't know!" types of responses.

This is legit one of the few subreddits that keeps me coming back to reddit. I really like the community here. 

I feel like answering someone's ID request in such a way is unfriendly, and a cop out. Even if you can't make out / do not have the skill to make a complete identification, the least you can do is say something along the lines of:

*looks like what you've got there is a [boletus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletus). Take more / better pictures and do a spore print for better help on identification. Also remember that it's highly suggested that you be 100% sure of you edible identification before you eat it.* 




 Yeah they're chickens.  I'm incredibly jealous 




 Great print!  




 No idea why you got down voted, that's pretty funny
