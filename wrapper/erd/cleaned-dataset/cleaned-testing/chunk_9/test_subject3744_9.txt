 Yes and mostly fix them as well. Only really touch macs when i have a friend needing help. 




 Love Modern Marvels though.

 If you want to see more women's sporting events mainstream, call your TV provider and tell them. They might not think the demand is there, because they haven't been told by enough of their customers.

 AWD will always be faster off the line than RWD. You would need wide drag tires to get the same off the line performance with RWD. 




 Hydroplaning can happen to any car if the water is deep enough and driving fast enough. 




 Will never remember that the next time i need to ss on a mac. 




 Don't believe he was trying to defend OP. Just letting everyone know how much it costs to charge an electric vehicle.  




 It was kind of a full body seizure. As soon as i found him it took several minutes of petting and talking to him to get him to stop. Had a very thick drool both times. After he seemed very riled up for 5 - 10 minutes. 

Just scary because at of all the cats i have had, he is the first one to have seizures. 




 One of my best cats was all black. He was probably the sweetest cat i've ever had. 

Dodge on the other hand has always been a beggar in the kitchen. Always gets what you wants, instead of his insulin shots which he hates me for.

Hates me even more for the blood sugar tests on his ears. 




 Has anyone experienced it and what should i look out for?

edit - Should add that he has been to the vet several times and only once because of a seizure. They did a blood test and found nothing abnormal. 


































 How thick do you cut it that it only take 4 hours? 




 I do it on a smoker.

 reading about him on ~~Vanity~~ Crabity Fair

? 




 Did some searching because i have damaged some plastics with it before. I have used it in car audio for years to clean glue and stains from carpets. 

Found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1xurvh/ipad_cleaned_with_acetone/cfex21o) that explains which plastics are vulnerable to acetone. 

Acetone is great at dissolving common domestic polymers like polystyrene, polyethylene, PET etc, alcohols are pretty crappy at it. Acetone is also more likely to swell even specialized polymers

Also found [this on another forum](http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?70,84367,85439#msg-85439) that says it will dissolve acrylic which your counter top was most likely made of.

Hopefully someone that knows chemistry can explain why.

edit - because i accidently hit enter  




 but i'm le tired. 




 Some plastics it will damage, but not all.  




 Acetone.

Edit - Should mention some plastics it should not be used on. 




 Even could have been posted at the entrance of the building. 




 Don't know why you are getting downvoted. Thinking it was posted on the entrance of the building? 




 Hey there buddy. 




 I'm normally not, but if you didn't start [being the prick first](https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/3bk0he/episodes_1_and_2_are_leaked_from_season_2/csp73x0), I wouldn't have been an asshole. Maybe if you had any reading comprehension you would understand that my first comment was never saying anything about hulu. 

Yes your comment that i first replied to was about sitting through 30 second commercials was no big deal. My reply was stating that i have sat through so many commercials in my lifetime, i will do the most i can to avoid them completely. Had nothing to do with hulu.

You don't watch 18 minutes of ads on hulu, you watch 18 minutes of ads on cable. 

I never said anything about watching hulu.

Honestly, big deal. Perhaps many of you are younger, but if you told me 20 years ago that I could watch practically any show I wanted at my command for practically nothing ($8/month is nothing), and all I had to put up with was a few commercials, I'd have shit myself. It's not hard to put it on mute for 30 seconds. Seriously, there's worse things that could happen to you in life than having to endure a short ad.

You never even mention hulu in the comment i replied to. You could have been speaking of any streaming service. That's why i pay $11 a month for netflix. I don't ever want to see a commercial unless i absolutely have to. 




 You dug back 4 days just to get this last word in? 




 I never downvoted him. I knew how it would turn out. 




 I'm going to wake up in the morning and it was just a dream.

 Finally, reddits board consists of Alexis Ohanian (reddits co-founder), Bob Sauerberg (President of Cond Nast), and Yishan Wong (reddits CEO).

Either way, Advance Publications would still be majority shareholder and would be steering the ship.
 




 The way this thing has unfolded just proves that ad revenue is more important than the members that make the community.

Pao was appointed by [Conde Nast](http://i.imgur.com/9d6TGW6.png).

[Conde Nast](http://i.imgur.com/9d6TGW6.png) has to answer to the shareholders of [Advance Publications](http://i.imgur.com/nlambsx.png).

This should show the world is only as important as the ad revenue they can produce and not what they can provide.

 You should not be getting downvoted. 




 Maybe if you handed out free ice cream to shit heads, they would be less shitty.  




 What if you could care less about getting a coupon for free ice cream? I would be pissed if i was pulled over and given a coupon for obeying traffic laws.

Maybe they should just take note of the license plate and mail it to the registered address. 




 Maybe i should point out that i am not trying to argue about the spill itself, but that the dead zone exists. 

 




 You might have active sealife on the coasts and near the surface. You won't have life at the bottom like plants where all the chemicals settle. 

This is a problem associated with every delta in the world. It's just worst because the Mississippi river basin covers 47% of the continent of the US.

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071020090707.htm

Maybe if you actually learn how ecosystems worked, i wouldn't have to sit "behind a keyboard and googling shit." 




 If you are asking about the [dead zone source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_\(ecology\)#Gulf_of_Mexico_.27Dead_Zone.27). 




 Your right. Most of the area around the Mississippi delta is pretty much dead. There is a ton of shit that comes down that river like pesticides/fertilizer used in agriculture that has killed a vast area of life around the delta.

Edit to add sources

http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/dead-zone/?ar_a=1

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_(ecology)

The area of temporary hypoxic bottom water that occurs most summers off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico [13] is the largest recurring hypoxic zone in the United States.[14] The Mississippi River, which is the drainage area for 41% of the continental United States, dumps high-nutrient runoff such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the Gulf of Mexico. According to a 2009 fact sheet created by NOAA, "seventy percent of nutrient loads that cause hypoxia are a result of this vast drainage basin."[15] which includes the heart of U.S. agribusiness, the Midwest. The discharge of treated sewage from urban areas (pop. c 12 million in 2009) combined with agricultural runoff deliver c. 1.7 million tons of phosphorus and nitrogen into the Gulf of Mexico every year.[15]

Edit - Should point out i'm not arguing the spill itself, but that the dead zone exists.

 Without video evidence it would be hard to say. This is why we need cameras on cops. I come from a family of cops and have been abused by cops as well.

 You're right, the bay harbor butcher. IIRC he really isn't the butcher but his kills are counted as the butchers. 




 Depends on what and how you burn them i suppose.

Not all countries can provide clean ways of burning fossil fuels. Greece still provides 50% of their power by burning lignite which is probably the lowest form of carbon content. They would have to burn way more than a plant burning coal.  




 Which is funny because most of the power to charge them comes from burning fossil fuels. 




 so many yankee fans there 




 Isn't the butcher Dexter's brother? 




 ah thanks, just started hanging out here during games.  




 what is with the rally spider thing? Did i miss something? 




 As well as representing your community in the TV ratings, you will receive a gift for your participation.

You would think they actually paid you for actually having to put an effort into pushing a button on/off next to your TV. 




 Not that hard to make. 




 You don't watch 18 minutes of ads on hulu

Did i say anything about hulu?

I hardly ever watch TV, only live tv i watch is pretty much sports. 

How do you think the content creators fund their projects?

No shit sherlock

If i like something i will actually buy the DVDs instead of sit through even a few 30 seconds commercials on hulu.

I will wait months to watch something on netflix instead of seeing it the day after it airs even with a few commercials. 
 




 I'm not young and i think i've gave to much of my life to advertisers already.

A one hour show is only about 42 minutes of actual content. 18 minutes of ads is way too much and usually they are the same commercials repeated.  




 I'm here if you need to talk.

 They initially faced the possibility of life in prison on murder charges, but pleaded guilty to lesser charges of voluntary manslaughter and assault.

There are two different charges because they took a plea deal. They were initially charged with murder.

So yes he is a murderer. 




 They initially faced the possibility of life in prison on murder charges, but pleaded guilty to lesser charges of voluntary manslaughter and assault.

You were right OP, they are murderers but took a plea deal that reduced the charges to manslaughter.

 In CA is illegal for them to expire unless they were given out for a promotion or to employees.

Most gift certificates and gift cards sold by retail sellers for use with the seller and its affiliates cannot contain an expiration date or a service fee, including a fee for dormancy.

and is pretty much considered legal tender, since it basically is a pre-paid credit card.

Any gift certificate sold after January 1, 1997, is redeemable in cash for its cash value, or subject to replacement with a new gift certificate at no cost to the purchaser or holder.4 Effective January 1, 2008, any gift certificate with a cash value of less than $10 is redeemable in cash, which includes currency or check, for its cash value.

http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/legal_guides/s-11.shtml 




 In 2009, Congress passed the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act, which set consumer protections for gift cards based on many state laws. The law provides that gift cards cannot expire within five years from the date they were activated and generally limits inactivity fee on gift cards except in certain circumstances, such as if there has been no transaction for at least 12 months. The federal law creates a floor for regulation and leaves room for state regulation on redeeming gift cards for cash and unclaimed property provisions.

Is the burning sensation normal? I'm assuming it is.

 I estimate that this was retired only after 8 years. I worked in a plastic factory and I assume that this would do 4 cycles a min. Times that by 60 for an hour, times that by 24 for a day ( most plastic factories run 24/7 due to the fact that the injectors would fill with hard plastic if left off over night ) then times that by about 365 gives you about 134 million bricks. Now I say 8 years cause there is down time for maintainiance and colour changes. If anyone has a better time frame I would like to know what you think.
