 There is a new Inoreader update on the Google Play.

PS: It crashes a lot for me. Reported back [here](http://forum.inoreader.com/index.php?/topic/534-android-client/?p=20446). 





































































 Users are sharing some very useful IFTTT recipes on Twitter which takes advantage of the IFTTT integration. You may find them [here](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23inoreaderIFTTT src=typd vertical=default f=tweets) (and of course you may subscribe to that Twitter search via Inoreader ;)).

[More info here](http://blog.inoreader.com/2015/06/supercharge-your-inoreader-with-ifttt.html). 




 The official forums are still the best way to get official support, this subreddit doesn't have to replace anything. It can be a place for discussions. /r/inoreader deserved a fresh start, it's up to the community to take advantage of it :).

 I'm here to announce that /r/Inoreader is diving into a new era!

Since the previous moderator had no further interest on Inoreader or /r/inoreader, i decided that this service deserves a better Reddit community. So, i asked him to add me as a moderator, he kindly agreed, de-modded himself and trusted the future of this subreddit in my hands. :)

But who am i?  This is test_subject3791. I'm a tech journalist and a big supporter of RSS as the best way to get, manage and curate my favorite content. After Google Reader shutdown and a lot of researching, testing and subscribing, i ended up using Inoreader everyday, for the past two years. I even translated the project in my native language.

So, to clear it up and to keep it transparent: **i'm not an employee of Inoreader and i make no profit from it**. I'm just a user of this service who thinks that Inoreader is the best RSS feed reader available right now and that it has a great potential to develop even further. **This is not a subreddit to support a company. This is a subreddit to support the users of a service that promotes and takes advantage of RSS** (Real Simple Syndication), a format for delivering regularly changing web content. I want /r/Inoreader to become an unofficial community for Inoreader, even with the participation of Inoreader's developers (since they are able to provide official technical support).

Keep it up and welcome back!

**EDIT**: Just updated the stylesheet :).
