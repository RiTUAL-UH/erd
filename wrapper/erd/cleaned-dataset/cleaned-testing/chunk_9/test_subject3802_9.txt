 It is so much lower than you think.  




 I just finished this book last night, I loved every second of it. The last few chapters definitely felt rushed, as though the author got bored of writing it and only continued because she had already spent so much time creating the characters so she may as well finish it. I don't understand why so many people disliked the ending. While I can see why people may find it unsatisfying, to have Nick or Amy kill the other would be completely out of character for both of them. I got the impression that Nick, deep down, knew all along just how much of a psychopath Amy was. When he figured out that she was framing him, his first thought was to admire the sheer brilliance of her plan. He knows that if his catastrophic love tragedy with Amy comes to an end, nothing will compare to it, for the rest of his life. He loves the depth of her intelligence, her ability to manipulate and weave stories of fiction into reality. 

No, the ending wasn't exciting - but it was realistic, and true to the characters that the author created.  




 What are your sources for this accusation? 




 What about the new exploit they used in the new version of the Pangu tool? 




 I wouldn't call wanting to see proof for a claim before I believe it is genuine wanting "to believe" a "narrative" 




 Sorry, but I am honestly having trouble with believing any claims ionic makes on twitter:

https://twitter.com/i0n1c/status/482002723026788352

https://twitter.com/i0n1c/status/482394671705247744

https://twitter.com/i0n1c/status/481392466202210304

he makes some pretty wild accusations without anything to back them up. 




 Except the Pangu team used logic and critical thinking and decided that using the exploit for iOS 7 before 8 came out made rational, logical sense given that it was likely to be patched for 8. If they hadn't, ionic would have continued to withhold the exploit until 8 came out, and by then the exploit would be wasted. So now, instead of saving an exploit, 2 have been used because of ionic's childish kicking and screaming, and asshole apologists like you. 




 No one cares, not even i0n1c

uh, have you seen his twitter lately? I'm pretty sure he cares, a lot. 




 Are we looking at the same tweet? The tweet doesn't tag any other twitter users in it, it simply links to a reddit post by /u/BarCouSeH, which doesn't seem to have any links to the Pangu team. 




 Why do you care? Ionic 100% gave them this code of his own free will, and they decided to use it. They can do whatever they want with it. If you've never paid hundreds of dollars to attend a class and then use the skills and knowledge you learned during that class then I guess it's hard for you to understand the situation. 




 Uh, yeah, that's entirely accurate. Is there another, valid reason for ionic to keep the exploit secret? I don't really understand how that equates to = pangu did it to teach him a lesson. It doesn't imply that at all; I simply stated a fact. 




 you think Pangu took bugs from i0n1c just to teach him a lesson

sorry, whereabouts did I say that? 




 Can you provide a source on him being apart of the Pangu team? 




 Um, who already told me that? The only comment saying so is yours.  




 I was under the impression that ionic revealed to them a bug or vulnerability in iOS that they then exploited with their own code. The vulnerability may have given them access to the system, but they still had to code an actual jailbreak from there - a jailbreak often takes multiple exploits/vulnerabilities to access various parts of the system. So how is it obvious that they "fucked it"? Even if they had copy and pasted a ready bunch of code that ionic wrote, does it matter? Honestly he deserves it for being such a dickwad and teasing everyone with his jailbreak, and he was retarded to think that it wouldn't eventually happen given that he didn't take any precautions against it. Additionally, the fact that the Pangu team released the new version with a new exploit proves that they are a completely capable team on their own feet, and simply used ionic's exploit because it was likely for it to get patched out in iOS 8 and there was no reason for it to be kept secret (except, you know, to make ionic money...). The fact that Pangu simply re-released it with their own exploit instead, not because they were in the wrong, but because they can't be bothered engaging in childish drama, speaks volumes about their character - especially in comparison with ionic.

This whole thing is beyond a joke, I have never ever seen a community that is nearly as dramatic, childish and whiney as the jailbreak community. Ionic should be embarrassed.  




 All that does is prove how melodramatic and childish he is.

And to further back that up:
https://mobile.twitter.com/i0n1c/status/475664357893079040

So he is fine with people using his exploits, so long as they don't release to the public (so he can keep making money from his classes)? This kid is a grade A douchebag.  




 But they didn't use his code? They simply used a vulnerability that was shown in ionics class. They still had to write the exploit and the jailbreak code. IMHO they have done absolutely nothing wrong, and ionic is just being butthurt because now he can no longer tease on twitter "omg guess who has a jailbreak for 7.1.1? ME NOT U LOL" 




 God I hate this thought process. Ionic taught them these vulnerabilities in a class that they PAID FOR. They had every right to use them, just like someone has the right to use code they wrote in a programming class. They do not need to ask him for permission, and it sucks that they felt so bullied/intimidated by him that they used another, separate vulnerability that could have potentially been used for ios 8.  









 Its extremely likely the nexus 4 will see L at this point. The device would have no issues running it, and google quoted the fact that the manufacturer for some aspect of the galaxy nexus' hardware was the reason it never saw an official KitKat update, not because they didn't want to update it. Everyone just chill out, and be patient.  




 DNG *is* a RAW format.  




 Nexus 4 would probably get it before GPE, IMO 




 tbh the bright, flat colors remind me a LOT of ios7. 




 Sorry, what I said was actually incorrect. I just checked the xda thread for multirom and it turns out it does support multiple android versions, provided that you unchecked the "share kernel" option when installing. Apologies for the misinformation.  




 Keep in mind that the galaxy nexus certainly had the ability to run kitkat, but it never got an official update.  




 Looks like [this guy](https://plus.google.com/103847211392162949263/posts/hZWiNuMoJGt) was almost spot on with the multitasking (almost 2 months ago). 




 Multirom doesn't work across multiple android versions. 

Edit: this is incorrect, see my comment below. Sorry.  




 Same thing happened to me when I had a car accident, a lady waited with me until the ambulance came. Never knew her name, I don't even remember her face - the only reason I know is because the EMTs that saved me told me so.  




 Or a person can get a job as an assistant bartender/barback, and get a year's worth of experience WHILE getting paid. 




 Sorry but how is any of this incorrect? I've been bartending for just over a year now and everything listed is pretty much entirely accurate. I've found that the majority of people don't mind explaining whats in a drink and even if someone gives you shit for not knowing, that will only ever happen once for that particular drink - once you know, you won't have to ask again. It's all about learning. Its unreasonable to expect someone to know every single possible drink and cocktail combination, bartending school or not. 




 http://www.redmondpie.com/download-ios-7.1.1-ipsw-for-iphone-and-ipad-download-links/

Once downloaded, shift-click on "restore" in iTunes and choose the downloaded ipsw. Make sure you download the correct one for your device, cause it can really fuck things up if you install an iPad ipsw on an iPhone. (Side note - restoring hacked ipsws was how some early jailbreaks were done!) 




 Yeah it really wouldn't have been much more trouble to add the vendor prefixes, there are websites you can just copy and paste the code into and it will automatically generate the extra code where relevant.  




 A lot of the stuff he's using (rotation, skew, border radius) is css3 spec, which Firefox only has basic support for. Chrome pretty much supports everything.  




 What makes you say that? Outside of /r/android, the nexus line is meaningless to the general public. I have a nexus 4, and people constantly ask me "is that the new Samsung?". Google has put ZERO advertising / marketing into the nexus line. I don't think I have seen a single advertisement for a nexus device here in Australia, whether that be print, television or internet. In fact, I'm pretty sure the only way to get a nexus phone in au is to buy it outright, off contract. 

While it seems silly for google to drop the nexus line, it isn't completely outside the realm of possibility. I doubt they make much money from it.  




 Ota won't work with those changes to your /system partition. AFAIK the ota updater does a checksum of /system and compares it to the stock image of your current android version to see if it matches, if it doesn't it will refuse to install. Best bet is to update using the factory images (make sure to remove -W from the script, otherwise it will wipe everything - either that or just flash each image manually with adb). 

That or you can go ahead and undo all the changes you made to your system partition (remove cerebus and su binary from /system etc) 




 Only downside to this: nobody to tell you what happened while you were in the bathroom.  




 kinda looks like a [kelpie](http://www.pups4sale.com.au/black_tan_kelpie_01.jpg) 




 Kelpie!

 Assuming a stock ROM, being rooted has no effect.

 As with all dark humor, it is context sensitive. I was just pointing out that I feel that I have attained the right to make jokes at my own expense in company of people that I am comfortable with and would not take offence to such a joke. (My mother's reaction to my above comment was a sharp intake of breath covered by a hand, "that's terrible", followed shortly by a suppressed giggle) 




 Thanks for the suggestion. I did look into other options but after consulting with my doctor he said it wouldn't really be worth it given that I'm staying in a relatively low-risk area (siem reap in cambodia). 




 from the original comment:  
Killing yourself isn't really something you joke about. Ever.

I was just pointing out that, like many tragic things, suicide can be joked about in the correct context. 




 As someone that has attempted suicide before, and suffered depression for 4+ years, I think I'm allowed to make jokes about suicide. I love to make people squirm. 

Example: I'm going overseas for the first time soon and so I had to get shots for things like flu and hep a, but we decided against me taking the vaccine for malaria (comes in pill form instead of a shot) because it has a significant risk of causing a relapse in people who have suffered from mental illness (or currently are). When we found out about the potential side effect, I turned to my mum and said "So what should it be, suicide or death by mosquito?". She was not pleased.

edit: this is gold. downvoted because i'm being insensitive about something that happened to... myself? i guess humor isn't an acceptable coping mechanism on reddit.

edit 2: i am finding it extremely amusing watching this and my comment below swing between negative and positive karma every few seconds. looks like reddit is really torn on the appropriateness of dark humor. 




 omg i cant get a job  
here's a list of jobs that are below me and i refuse to apply for 




 wait what? how do you get it to mirror the monitor? 




 Are you aware that's exactly what I just said? Different shutter lengths (all other aspects remaining the same) = different exposures. The exposures are then overlaid. 




 Ok, so explain to me exactly what "low level" HDR is? 




 The HDR on the Google camera is done by taking three exposures: under, on point and over - which is a true HDR.  




 Do you also tell people to stop being happy because someone else has it better? 




 "You shouldn't be happy because someone else has it much, much better than you." 

See how stupid that sounds? 




 That's kinda the point though, isn't it? The more people that use it, the larger it will grow and you'll be able to use it for more stuff.  




 Finally, an askreddit thread I can actually contribute to! 

I was officially diagnosed with depression in the October of 2011, after a suicide attempt - but I suffered from depression dating back to as early as 2009. I've read many of the responses here about exercise, diet and hobbies, and while they are very accurate and can be extremely helpful to a person that suffers from depression as a result of an event or life situation, sometimes extreme cases of clinical depression require additional life changes such as medication and therapy.

I've written about my experiences on reddit before, so I'll try to keep this short. I suffered from very severe depression for about three and a half years (my diagnosis has jumped around a fair bit because of my unpredictable behaviour and mood; things like bipolar II and borderline personality disorder were thrown around before they finally settled on clinical depression and severe anxiety disorder). Depression cost me countless friends, almost tore my family apart and has come very, very close to taking my life more than once. It is indescribable and if you have never suffered from it you will never be able to comprehend the depth of the despair a depressed person feels when they're at rock bottom. I used to fake a lot of smiles and laughs, and I remember the first time I genuinely laughed I immediately burst into tears; I realized - after years of nothing but a dull plateau that was occasionally interrupted by extreme spikes in both directions - that *this was how normal people felt all. the. time.*

Anyone that's suffered from a depressive episode and then started a course of antidepressants knows the way it feels when you start to feel normal... have you ever had someone sit on your shoulders for a while, and then taken them off? Once they get off, you feel so *light*, like you're about to float away. You just feel... good. Nice. Everything doesn't take stupid amounts of effort anymore, you can hold more thoughts inside your head, and everything feels warmer and moves quicker. 

I'm stable now, and currently not taking any medication. When you have depression, there is no beating it. It is just something I have to manage, and I will do so for the rest of my life. I know the signs of when I start to spiral, I have devised and perfected the necessary steps to keep myself safe, stable and functioning. When I see the signs, the first thing I do is let someone know - usually my parents - and ask them to keep an eye out for any strange behaviour and let me know. I know what the onset of a panic attack is now, I know how to keep my thought patterns in check and the kind of situations and people that I need to avoid.

Having said that, it's hard. Its really fucking hard. What is normal everyday life for other people is an uphill battle for me. Few people will ever understand why, while waiting for a train, I have to close my eyes as it enters the station. Or why I cut contact with my best friend because he has certain personality traits that have triggered depressive episodes for me. Why I say no to social outings sometimes, because I know that if I spend a lot of time with other people I have problems adjusting to being by myself again so I start to crash. None of even my closest friends get it, and in all honesty I hope they never do - because it would mean that they have experienced it themselves.

Its ok. This is my lot in life and I'm glad for it. Being a depressive make you see the world in a completely different way, and I like that. 




 That comment didn't actually say anything about the persons gender. 




 Your references are out of control man, everyone knows that.  




 No, Gerald. 




 You mean Gary 




 Yeah it is. Its to avoid YouTube's automatic copyright scanner thing.  









 What happened to klyph? 




 Look at ops comment (currently at the top). He cut the guy off because he was previously waiting in the line but got OUT of the line to cut ahead. Not cool.  




 haha love your take on this, thank you! 




 I think people get caught up in it, I have honestly never seen anyone "freak out" about it though. Its important to follow it when you're first starting because it takes a while to learn when its appropriate to break the rule. Someone who has never followed the rule of thirds will not have the compositional skills as someone who followed it religiously and now knows when, and how, to break it.  




 Don't know if its what you were going for but I'm getting a real tron vibe from this and it is AWESOME. Thanks! 




 I love watercolor, thanks so much! 




 I really like the first one, thank you! 




 sorry I honestly didn't mean to come across as demeaning or condescending, but after re-reading my comment I can see how easily it would be perceived that way. Most smartphones have a "tethering" feature that essentially creates a wifi hotspot that would make a chromecast operate as desired. :) 




 God damn I keep coming back to my jawline haha. It's such a small part of the drawing but I love the way it looks. 




 this is really good, especially for something drawn in such little time. Thanks! 




 Not Australian until its a green hose pipe.  




 Don't know about op but I personally work in hospitality and regularly do 12-14 hour shifts. When you're in a fast spaced environment like a busy restaurant, bar or night club, the hours fly by really quickly, since there is always something to do. (Except if you're closing. FUCK those last 2-3 hours). 




 Could you not setup a wireless hotspot on your laptop (adhoc) or phone? It only needs a WiFi LAN connection to work.  









 Your launcher has little to do with it.  









 I was instructed by management to do it, and it was one of a very long list of reasons that I left. 




 I guess so, but RR (or at least, the ones I worked at) are particularly bad (especially compared to say, McDonald's - I have worked there also). A few things off the top of my head:

* It is common to still serve food that has been dropped on the floor
* Chips are often served 30+ minutes old in a slow period - the heater keeps them hot but they are still old chips (they are sometimes dipped back into the fryer to freshen them up)
* Stores would regurlarly re-date the desserts kept in the fridge - it was not uncommon for customers to come back complaining about their cheesecake or chocolate mousse being sour/out of date/otherwise off
* When food was returned to us (due to a customer complaint) it would often be re-used (with us having no idea what the customer has done to it during the time it took for them to bring it back)
* Our gravy and mashed potato is just made from powder + hot water (this one ain't so bad, cause it tastes fucking delicious anyway lol)
* Rooster rolls are made using 3+ day old chicken that they were unable to sell. They are made in the morning and kept in the fridge until close and are simply microwaved when they get ordered - it is not uncommon to find bones in them (kitchen staff have to strip the chicken from the carcass when making them, and kitchen staff are fucking lazy)
* If you order chips without salt, there's about an 80% chance they will simply drop already salted chips back into the fryer for a few seconds and then serve them to you
* Those banana fritters that everyone loves - has anyone tried pulling off the crumbs to see the banana underneath? 95% of the time they're a mushy, black mess. 
* Gloves and hairnets are optional

The ONLY thing you should eat from that place is the roast chicken. They have good quality chicken, and it is properly slow roasted in ovens (although how clean those ovens are depends on how quickly the kitchen closer wanted to get out the night before) for about an hour. 




 I worked at a red rooster on the gold coast for 3 years, and covered shifts for pretty much every store on the gold coast... Trust me, you do not want to eat there.  




 Voxli used to be able to do it. You had to install a plugin though.  




 I had to scroll too far into the comments to find this reference.  




 What about it didn't you like? 




 Are you being serious? I thought Sinister was really well done.  




 Again,less to do with actually using the software but more about converting a database over to its system, possibly manually reentering tags and creating collections.  




 Workflow in terms of modules, presets and the persons database (how tags and star ratings are handled, as well as collections and filenames) can be quite different and extends further than "a bunch of sliders". 




 Short blogger was pretty good before the official app was released, but I stopped using it since I preferred the official one. What don't you like about it? 




 This can be fixed with custom ROMs/xposed but your point is still valid. Full screen landscape keyboard has no place in android anymore (or at the very least there should be an option).  




 Can confirm, currently using a 20D. :( I love this body to pieces but it has terrible ISO performance.  




 I have the TTL 465 and love it.  




 That's my point here... its not actually doing any SMS sending - the app does this over data. Turn off your data and wifi and the app won't work anymore. 




 No they don't? That's why there are no SMS app replacements on the app store. You have to be jailbroken. 




 Huh? 




 You can apply the preset in the develop panel and then click the compare button (the Y|Y button down the bottom of the develop module) if that helps? 




 There is no difference, all canon DSLR flash mounts are the same. They're just trying to saturate search results (people will often search "flash for canon t3i").  




 You can replicate this by layering the original image and the filtered one on top and just lowering the opacity.  




 How will they manage that when apple doesn't allow apps to interfere with sms at all? 




 Its not House on the Haunted Hill or it's sequel, Return to the House on the Haunted Hill? 




 fuck sake i hate reading things like this cause it always gets me upset and angry. i broke up with a girl i had been dating for 4 years - it was me that initiated the breakup but i was still extremely heartbroken to do it (i still very much loved her but our relationship was toxic for the both of us). knowing that my best mate was kind of a dick head and a desperate virgin, i specifically asked him not to try anything with her and, because he was pretty much my only friend at the time (i lost the majority of my friends through the breakup. fuck people are petty) that i would really need his support for the following months. what happens the next day? he's texting her and snapchatting her nudes. FUCK PEOPLE. 




 /u/mediumpace 




 Did you read the article? The title is a bit sensationalist but it basically boils down to KitKat is now only allowing apps to write in a specific place on the sdcard - this is good for everyone! No more sdcard clutter.  




 Why? 




 Its not a feature in gravity box unfortunately but some ROMs do have this. I know cm does for sure.  




 A good barista should be able to control how much foam goes into the cup without a spoon. ;) 




 Nothing in this thread has touched me but this hits hard. This was something me and my ex used to do every now and then (OK I lied, we did this quite often, we were both in our mid teens so our metabolisms could handle it without it affecting our weight) 




 Assuming the machine is hooked up to a water source, it pushes water through the coffee in the group handle (the cup that holds the coffee) and into the cup. Then you froth the milk using the further (which also heats it). 

Source: I'm a barista.  




 It's a joint so its a little but different.  




 People still make fun of me for taking antidepressants.  









 The gravity box dev recently released an update that allows you to turn off individual tweaks, so if you disable the navigation bar tweaks you shouldn't have any conflicts (the reason you were having issues with it was because gravity box is really only meant for stock and so your ROMs navbar implementation was conflicting with gravity box's).
