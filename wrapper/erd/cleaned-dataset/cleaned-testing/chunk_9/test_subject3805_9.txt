 Those are gorgeous!! Im knitting my mom a shawlette right now in knitpicks stroll... Those socks look awesome i might just have to try! 




 Beautiful! Do you have any good projects in mind? Im trying to find a simple but elegant sock. Maybe a few cables or something. Time to search the depths of ravelry :) 




 I just gave in - bought some in atlantico yesterday. there colors are so beautiful i can't stop looking at it! 




 I have a puppy and hes pretty big :( wahh i need a cat so i can make one of these!!! 




 I LOVE that idea but i only have 200 yds and want to work with what i have - thats a great suggestion for the future, and tarn is a great choice because of its durability... 




 Great idea:) my mom would like that!
