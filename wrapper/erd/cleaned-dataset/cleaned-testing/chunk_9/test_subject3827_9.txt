 I particularly disagree with the breaking the illusion - watch the space battle from RotJ, probably one of the best I've seen. I do agree that the prequel fights were more seamless 




 SPAAACCEE COOOPPP!! 




 It's gonna come down to Justice League Part 2 and Infinity War Part 2 coming in the same year. 




 Which is not a bad thing 




 I think Liberals are just as much against ISIS as everyone else 




 I thought Part II was the most exciting of the whole trilogy... 




 What cringey moments are there in The Empire Strikes Back?  




 That's similar to how I felt about Whiplash - I really enjoyed it, I thought it was well written, and great performances were given, but it's pretty one-dimensional when you think about it. Not much to interpret or reflect on, everything it's trying to say is just *there*, given to you. 




 But the cinematography is supposed to resemble a stage play 




 But *he's* usually fine in those movies, even if the movies themselves are not. He is good at giving a fun charismatic performance. 




 First of all, the reveal is at the end of Empire, not in the middle.

And I think you're forgetting that we know Anakin impregnated Padme in Revenge of the Sith, and Padme later gives birth to Luke. We also see Anakin become Vader. 




 The art ones that were released at Star Wars Celebration 




 I think that particular part (space battles) can be very challenging and expensive, I think they'd rather use CGI for it. 




 Whoa, I never would've thought of that.... 




 ... Up Girl 




 I mean there's only really been 2 movie Jokers, and the other one that you have to compare Nicholson with is Ledger, so... 




 Yeah 




 Just curious about your reasoning behind Kubrick and Pixar? 




 That's the 70s for ya 




 I hope you got that they were making a reference to something 




 I don't think that necessarily has to do with anything - anyone who has good taste in movies can easily see which is better. 




 Fucking Zack. 




 QUALITY POST RIGHT HERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 




 There's no depth to any of the characters really, mostly due to the fact that Nolan likes to put action and visuals above actors a lot of the time. The only reason Ledger was good is because he's already a pretty good performer. 




  an unpopular *opinion*

That is a fact, my friend. 




 Anything's silly if you describe it like that, those things work in the Star Wars universe. 




 The Godfather Part III isn't bad at all (minus Sofia Coppola), they're just not as good as the first 2. 




 The civil rights novelty? What is that supposed to mean? 




 That could be cool 




 What's with 3PO having red on the left and the First Order TIE also having red on the left? Almost the same shade, too. 




 I think it depends if you bought it or if someone loaned it to you  




 Chunky mayonnaise with stale Goldfish crackers? 




 I can tell things are gonna get *weird* once that movie comes out.... 




 Get some of the "making of" books for Episodes 1 and 2 - you can see that there really is a lot of effort put into sets and miniatures, along with things like the design of costumes and ships.

People act like no one actually tried on these movies, when that's really not true to any extent. 




 You know that Sony products have been in Bond movies since the 60's, right? 




 So when someone doesn't like a movie that /r/movies likes, we downvote it, but when someone doesn't like a movie that /r/movies *doesn't* like, we upvote it? 




 But why wouldn't a car company sponsor all the vehicles in an amusement park? You act like there's *not* a Starbucks on every block in real life. 




 Yeah - he would've aged the right amount, and Alderaan's not gone yet! 




 I mean in terms of the two teasers, the cast, and the crew 




 Good point 




 I mean, he was the chosen one! 




 Don't you mean 12:01am 12/19? 




 Google is your friend in situations like these 




 Who cares if we haven't done it since? We've proved that we're capable of doing it, but now we're striving for bigger and better things. 




 But keep in mind that JJ didn't write those 




 Well, from what we've seen so far  




 None of those things are actually true though  




 So is basically every other Star Wars character, if you think about it - it takes time to get to know the person, and eventually you'll get used to it. 




 [uj] But you still can't deny that this movie will be great [rj] 




 It's possible that they could've written that in after Ridley was cast - they could also have it as a reveal in VIII or IX 




 Anything to keep this sub from overflowing with fake leaks 




 He's a director, of a lot of mainstream movies I'm sure you've heard of.

The Dark Knight. Inception. Interstellar. 




 Yeah, also because there already are Asian actors in this movie 




 Only if it's IMAX 2D 




 Sorry, "Monty Python" 




 The piano? Just non-Star Wars related notes 




 That's a Warwick Davis 




 That's why we should have weekly discussion threads or something, to keep us busy. 




 Make that a rule.

9/24, not bad 




 Carries already there, and there's two seats left still - Luke and Han 




 Two seats left - I'm calling Serkis and MVS 




 General Hux! 




 Jurassic World director
 




 Thanks 




 Look at the size of that thing! 




 Haha you printed it out! My work! It feels so good!

And by the way, Ridley and Boyega showed up. 




 Not saying he's right, but might as well wait until tonight. It's a pretty risky move saying something like this if it won't turn out to be true. 




 From this

 Well, I meant on this sub 




 I'm not unfortunately - I just saw this on Instagram, but I'm sure there will be *plenty* of updates after/during the panel. 




 I don't doubt that I will be, but it's not like this is new news either - this is the same wording they used when they announced the panel last month. 




 They are if they're getting a lot of views and making money from it 




 [uj/] Hey, I was the one who responded to him, and I post here pretty frequently - I was just giving him a reason as to why it was on the front page, and he was sorta being an asshole about it [uj] 




 So if the *same shot* was filmed by a different director you would've rolled your eyes? Why?? 




 Well what else would they be showing? Special look is pretty vague, and we know there's not gonna be a trailer or footage - it's probably gonna be exactly what you expect. Nothing that groundbreaking or exciting. 




 That's the panel 




 "I wanted cake!" 









 I think Spielberg wants to stay far away from those Jaws sequels  




 To see the trailer, I meant - I have the app and everything already 




 Realistically, he would end up directing Indy 5 with Chris Pratt, if that ever happens  




 Why would they go from a flat logo to a glossy one? That's the opposite of what most companies are doing. 




 Oh yeah, all 20 million of them? Makes sense.  




 Looks a little like a custom, but probably real. 




 Probably. 




 Yeah, it's that part im worried about 




 Ugh. Does that mean I also have to register with a Disney account? I hope not.... 




 Thanks a bunch! 




 Can you put up my SDCC bingo?

http://imgur.com/cJBVoVb 




 Yeah but that's the name of the Star Wars alphabet 




 I think it might be to late, from what I've heard. 




 Check where? 




 Me too... 




 I looked around a little, but I couldn't find anything unfortunately. 




 No it doesn't - that would be like saying there was too much news coverage about 9/11 on 9/14 




 Beating a dead horse that's only 8 days old?  




 I think the part you actually need to scan is cut out of that picture. 




 Posting their video is a circlejerky thing? It's funny and it relates to this subreddit. 




 Me too. Did you hear the dialogue it had (the Stormtrooper)? 




 "This December" was in the last trailer, I don't know why *that* would clue you into to this description being fake. 




 Yoda disappeared when he died in Return of the Jedi. Anakin did when Luke burned the Darth Vader suit in that same movie. 




 I *really* doubt it. For one thing, he's too old to be playing a young (15-25 year old) Han. Secondly, he looks very little like Harrison Ford, and doesn't sound remotely like him either. The people at Disney are smart, and I think they are well aware of the fact that this choice will be heavily scrutinized, so I would expect them to cast an unknown actor who has the same mannerisms as Ford.  




 But I doubt the source is Lucasfilm, or else it would've been published as official news from them. 




 YOULL NO LONGR FEAR THE DARK SIDE!!!!!!,;$!!!

That? 




 "Star Wars Sequel Trilogy"

I need ratings, plot synopsizes, titles, whatever I can get 




 That sounds pretty good to me  




 I'm not staying up late just for that, and I don't know why you would either, especially considering you just called him an asshole.
