 Have yet to see anyone mention SJW's, particularly the young, entitled, bratty ones (wait, that's all of them) who pollute the internet and youtube and Tumblr, who clearly just finished their first woman's study and race relations class, yet totally lack in life experience and character and adversity (as they clearly don't understand that adversity and conflict shapes us and helps us grow), and it's all so totally obvious and cringe-worthy how ignorant and herd-like they are as they film their trite videos from their rich-ass parent's beautiful house.  Yeah... total assholes. 




 Dude, fuck me too! Did you know that if you layer wings for marie parts 1 and 2, A Perfect Circle's 13th Step, and Puscifer on top of Lateralus, and their upcoming album set to drop in 2051, it creates a super secret song?  Dude...  you just don't understand Maynard like I do. 




 Yes, I know you know because you have seen the other side.  Thank god we will come to once we have dissolved back into the mud!


Edit:  You sound like a first year philosophy student, but I could be wrong ;)  That being said, fuck those other 'same goops' who don't use their turn signals! 




 You sure you can do it without crossing over to the dark-side of douche baggery, projection, hypocricy, and moral superiority?  :D 




 Yeah, groups are just a social construct! 




 You park in two spaces most places you go, forgot that turn signals exist, and you drive around like you're the only dickhead on the road? 




 Yeah.  "Groups" are just a social construct, and they don't occur in nature or society...oh wait :D 




 That's total jody talk bro!  Just kidding.  I'm totally with you.  I totally respect the fuck our of our bloated military budget, and our massive war machinery (and I mean that, no sarcasm.  I'd rather it be someone else than us), but for the dudes who sign up for the job, keep that in mind - you are being paid to do a job, and whether you go overseas or not, you are not a goddamn martyr.  Let people respect you and your posititon for what they are - you don't have to rub it in their face in aggressive manners as if you are somehow better than the other worker bees around you. 




 Totally.  Those fuckers are so annoying :D 




 I'd tell you, but you've probably never heard of them anyway... 




 Should we help him?  Naw, get your phone so we can film him dying... 




 Whoa, way to use dude as a shield.  What a piece of shit! 




 If she wasn't a collage girl before, she is definitely a collage girl now. 




 Sweet!  New Hat!  (holy hell, I'm sorry, oh dear lord Satan...) 




 The title reminds me of something out of Futurama... 




 Whoa.... 




 I'm sorry, but this is the only video on here I ever watched that made me laugh... it's just, so ridiculous  :( 




 Sad, for sure, but I'm still on the fence about kids dying being somehow worse or more sad than adults dying.  Adults actually have responsibilities, and often are more directly contributing to the world, and they often have families and earning potential and etc, or if they are geniuses, it really is a tragedy when they die, because they possibly had the power, ability, and intelligence to make positive changes in the world, whereas kids don't directly contribute to society, and they get to die not having to know how truly fucking terrifying yet mundane life on this god-forsaken rock can be (aside cases of extreme abuse, or examples where parents brutalize and then kill their kids, etc).  I mean, I know people are more emotionally affected by children's deaths, but beyond that, is there a solid reason/argument to truly back up that it is somehow more sad?  Sure, we can say they died before they could develop and live up to their potential, but I'd just counter that again with, "well, at least they got to die when life was still simple and fun."  Anyone care to try to sway me either way? 




 Uuuh, what the hell does that poor translation mean?  I am trying to understand what happened and is going on, but the flip flops behind that dude's mangled head is throwing me off... 




 Most of those assholes got exactly what they courted, but still, the way those bodies fly is goddamn freaky! 




 Women and their shoes... 




 She went down quicker than Irwin in a whole tankful of stingrays! 




 The great mysteries of life :/ 




 Zoom zoom! 




 What a great way to go.  Buncha ass-holes more interested in filming you than helping you as your brain-matter splatters everywhere as they flop you around on the ground.  The point is, wear a fucking helmet! 




 Was a great show at first, but it got so bad/ridiculous by the end of it :/ 




 Wheeeee! 




 Wait.  Why did the one person on the motorcycle crash into them?  And how did the cops even know what was going on?  There were no cops behind them as far as I could tell, so how did they decide to come up and just start shooting everybody? 




 I don't remember mentioning anything about the wheel and its scaling, but the last thing Ludwig's needs is to scale off of Arcane on top of STR and/or SKL, as Ludwig's is by far the easiest weapon to ramp up the damage and make OP, even with a lower quality build, and even with sub-par gems :D 




 Yeah, they become more challenging, and I actually personally enjoy the depth 4-5 story dungeons quite a bit, at least more than how boring and easy the first few dungeons are.  And occasionally I do really enjoy exploring some of the odd and more challenging randomly generated depth 5 dungeons :D 




 Bone in turkey leg? 




 I always think of him as "Game Of Thrones Louis CK" 




 Drake?  Or they could find music that doesn't suck :P


In all seriousness though, heart-ache is some real shit.  Instead of trying to drink yourself silly, maybe you should let yourself feel the heart-ache, and process it, and deal with it, instead of trying to numb the pain and run away from it?  That shit takes time.  Three years isn't going to vanish in one night, or one week, or one month, and probably even a year or two, and a few gallons of vodka and a buncha boxes of doughnuts won't change that either.  Just keep in mind, she said that she wasn't in love with you, not that *you are unlovable* or *unworthy of other people's love,* just not her love.  People grow apart, people fall in and out of love, so the actual break-up often takes the other person by surprise, but it can and does happen, and nothing is forever, even if it is promised and especially if it is expected.  And in time, maybe you should see a therapist, or talk to some people you know and trust.  Wish ya the best.
 




 Seriously.  Who the fuck keeps tomatoes in a jar? 




 I though it was usually because the people who failed to merge and waited till the last minute were lazy and not paying attention and now fuck everybody else because they need to cut someone off... that's why I assume most people don't want to have some asshole cut them off at last minute (not to give OP a pass on his douche baggery). 




 VRUMMM VRUUUM!  Organ donor douche bag calling card!  :P

Just fuckin around.  Glad you're alright man, you sound like an alright dude.  Funny that a lot of people have that awareness/perception/opinion that Mustangs are the calling card of the douche bags, but I find BMW Drivers to be some of the shittiest, dumbest, most selfishly douchey motherfuckers out there on the road.... and there are endless droves of them here in California :( 




 fag no pert begs! 




 no pert beging u faget! 




 Is accomplishment the right word for it?  Gamers like to challenge themselves, and I know there are trophies and other odds and ends for whatever reasons, but I'm pretty sure most gamers don't pick up games (entertainment) just for the trophy aspect of it, and they don't set out consciously thinking, 'I am going to accomplish a lot in this game.' 




 Oh, I dodge bone marrow ash to be sure.  That shit hurts.  Now I just need to practice my *break-distance/circle strafe to the left with shield up* for all the rest of the gun spammers.  Sounds thrilling.  Thanks again :D 




 Love the monster theme dude.  Keep it up.  Would love to see what you put together in time.  And I also love how people are so quick to interject their asinine opinions when it comes to tattoos and what people should or shouldn't have done to their body.  I love seeing more original or different art work, as opposed to the same lame ass japanese koi/lotus/samarui/cheetah print/swallows/anchors/stars/skulls that every person with no imagination comes up with :D  




 Ha.  I still love all my work.  I loved them a lifetime ago when I got them, and I love them to this day. 




 What would you rather he collect?  What would make YOU happy, since this is about you and your opinion.  Maybe some birds, or a skull, or an anchor, or how about some stars?  Some stars would be really wicked cool and original.  Oh, I know.  He could get a koi fish, or some other lame ass shit that people get tatted with all the time.  Stop the douche-baggery. 




 Heya.  So in the meantime, just use the best damage gems you can find, but once you're in a place to farm the depth 5 root chalice gyphs, check out this guide (there are plenty of other good ones out there too):


http://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/32gbr1/how_to_farm_the_best_blood_gems/


Just keep in mind you don't need to make chalice dungeons with your own materials for every dungeon you want to explore.  All you have to do is make a Fetid/Rotten/Cursed dungeon of one type (I always use the pthumeru ihyll root chalice, with all rites), and that will give you access to every chalice glyph out there.  Good hunting to you  o/

 




 What level are you?  And what are your stats so far(ie, 50 vit, 25 end, 50 SKL?)?  Also, do you plan on doing much co-op and PvP?  If so, you'd want to cap your blood level around 100-125 ( or even 150) for best results for match making. 




 Cool.  Didn't have time to PvP last night, but I tested it on some mobs.  Most shots seemed to take up half my endurance, and still do a chunk of damage to my health.  Offhand, do you know how much evelyn's typically do in terms of damage when you block?  Thanks.  I'll have time to test it in actual PvP tonight.   




 Not sure about the cane, as I am not a big fan of it myself. If it has a triangle slot, Then I'd say shoot for the best physical gems you can put into it (27% radials) and a 27% triangle. If it has a waning slot, the best you can put in is a bit lower, at like 23%ish, but apparently there are ultra rare +28% damage waning gems, but I and most other people I know have never found one in many hours of game play on many different characters.  




 It's still easy to find dedicated PvP in a number of places, but what we are missing is a no-health-penalty dueling sort bell or arena (among other things, like worthwhile covenants, a multi-player system that doesn't suck and take so long, etc). 


I was happy to see that they gave invaders (ie, griefing pve players) a run for their money in te base game pre patch 1.04, ie, stacking odds against the invader (as previous games often favored invaders, especially since they were built for PvP) but I was bummed that invasion areas are so limited


The level range thing is a stretch, but not everyone coordinates with passwords to summon super high level players,  and I am all for letting people have fun how they want to, but still :/ 




 For any and all root variations of F/R/C you only ever need to generate one yourself (so long as you have the prerequisite root chalices in your inventory), and that is to create a F\R\C\ pthumerian Ihyll root chalice. Once you create that one dungeon with all offerings using your own materials, you will then have access to all available chalice glyphs out there.


Don't waste your chalice materials making one dungeon for each glyph you want to try. Just create the one I mentioned, and enjoy :) 




 Sure.  Have you aleady cleared the main story line chalices and obtained all the root chalices and so forth?   




 Don't have the info off-hand at the moment, but there are a few fairly easy dungeons to farm for all the best or most of the best gems you could need or want, from the 27% physical gems to the +% phys and flat arcane gems.  Most involve repeatedly farming the first layer bosses, or one of the nearby enemies.  Will drop you a line later with more info and some links if you can't find it in the mean-time. 




 I know.  You can use any button (as opposed to old DaS methods of bumpers) in Bloodborne to lessen the damage and all that, but the grab, the attack, the hunter slumping to the ground, and the stand up animations take far too fucking long, for such a fast paced game.  It's not even exciting or frightening (like being chomped on by a mimic) or that damaging.  It's boring and it slows the action down to zero.  




 Yeah, those frame drops fucking suck, and her shrill screach makes me want to destroy my speakers and stick screw-drivers into my ear drums  




 Oh god!  They were so terrible and frightening and confusing to fight for the first time.  And their sack full of dead hookers stunk :c 




 Camera is a cheap ass!  They totally just copied/pasted him back from DeS!  Lazy FROM  




 Hate it when they slurp the insight out of my ass :c 




 Any enemy and their stupid twenty-two minute-long grab/attack animation, where my hunter then takes a nap, and is finally able to wake up and fight again.  Seriously, brain-suckers and their stupid-ass magic/grab spam can fuck off and die, and whoever created those enemies needs to be fired and commit soduko!  


Whenever my hunter is grabbed by a brain sucker or snake man or garden of eyes, I go outside for a smoke, take a dump, watch the news, make dinner, and then I usually get back just in time as the brainsucker is done sucking out my insight, and then my character lays down for a nap, and is ready to finally stand back up and continue the fight :D


Edit: worth noting, I don't think there are enough spider-summoning bell maidens in game, and they should always come in quadruplets.  Two isn't enough. 




 Yes.  Even with high skill, the BB has a low base physical damage (lower than saw spear and saw cleaver even at +10), but it attacks fast, and the 2h movesets don't take as much stamina as the other heavy weapons (ie, standard R1 = 28 on BB, vs 36 on LHB).  If you only buff the physical portion of the damage via gems, you are only buffing one portion of it's damage, and 27% (even x3) of its base damage isn't that much :D 




 Eh, it's hit and miss.  Sometimes I am doing the shredding, and other times they are doing the shredding.  There usually isn't much of a chance to back off and be defensive, as most fights can and do end in two or three quick R1's or a good follow up or quick combo, and even then, most people will just start shooting or throwing knives, so I've seldom found that to be of much use (at least in wider and more open areas). :D 




 Yes, the standard BoM has the best slots for this, two radials and a triangle. 




 I don't know why it's there, I was just mentioning how to best use what is there :D 




 The burial blade has one of the lowest base physical damage values at +10, lower than even the saw cleaver and the saw spear.  If you stick pure physical gems on it, you still won't get as much out of it as buffing both physical and arcane damage.  Plus, both the one hand and even the two handed versions of the weapon attack pretty damn fast, and don't use up as much stamina as other larger weapons, leaving you room for multiple combos and hits. 




 Yeah.  I like the unlocked BB, so maybe I need to get a handle on the unlocked LHB, but speaking of the 20 second meta, 27% gems might be a bit much... :P 




 I just responded to your other post.  Not sure if BB/BoM are meant for full arcane builds, as I'm pretty sure the arcane blood gem stones don't convert the damage of it properly or fully, no?  Also, the scaling with arcane is terrible (ie, the D in STR scaling on a +10 BB will give you more AR than the B in ARC).  Point is, if you try to just boost the physical, or just the arcane, you are gimping the weapon.  As they both hit fast and quick, and the best gems for them are the *+physical % with +flat arcane damage* as they boost both types of damage, and will raise your AR much higher than pure SKL, pure ARC, a split, or either pure phys or arc blood gems. 




 Nope.  You definiately don't need or want too much arcane (unless you want to use hunter's tools, or don't care about meta levels) for the BoM/BB, as the scaling from ARC is miniscule compared to how the split damage works as a whole.  You'll only get a few AR out of investing precious levels into arcane.  The pure physical gems are lacking for BoM/BB as well, because you are only increasing one side of the damage, which has a lower base value in the first place.  The gems you want are the ones that have both +physical % damage and +flat arcane damage.  That is how you get your BB to 650-750 AR, and your BoMs to 400-500 AR, but what sucks is, compared to other weapons that are easier to make OP early in the game, you'll need an Uncanny Burial Blade (for triangle slot), so don't waste your chunks/blood rocks on the regular BB if you can help it.  Also, you'll need to get access to the depth 5 cursed dungeons to get the best phys/flat arcane gems available in both radial and triangle form, and these are used for both the BoM and the Uncanny BB.  In the mean time, if you find that your weapons are too weak, you could always get a LHB, as it scales great with SKL and STR, and it is easy to raise the AR on it with a few decent gems, and it might outdamage what you are using now, but again, LHB like the BB is best in its uncanny version for the triangle slot.  Hope this helps!



Edit:  IIRC, you can at least get some +7-8%/ +30-35 flat arcane damage gems somewhere in the chalices or main game (to tide you over until you can get the 8-9%/+60-70 gems), but I don't remember where they came from :/ 




 Probably the whole DaS *"shit we ran out of development time, so just copy/pastra capra and taurus demons and we'll make due"* sort of things :/ 




 Totally.  If I want to randomly genocide a whole city/town/area, I should be able to, and to hell with whoever is trying to fend me, the foreign invader, off :D 




 Pretty much the same as DaS.  Dude handed us his vague ass quest (though he subtly hinted about 'keeping the torch lit'), and then the chosen undead turns total asshole, killing everything that was content to sit there and drool for eternity until we came along and killed it. 




 LOL 




 Perception is not synonymous with IQ.  Schizophrenic people of all ranges of intelligence see all sorts of things we can't see, after all.


Emotional intelligence is not synonymous with IQ either.


I mean, there are many facets to intelligence, so it depends.  And no, I don't mean this from the angle of "street smarts vs. book smarts," as I've known too many 'street smart' people who just used it as an excuse for their stupidity.  Sure, there can be some truth there, but mostly I've seen dumb people use it to rationalize their own ineptness ;) 




 I enjoyed the main story line areas for the most part.  I think the chalices could have been better designed, as slogging through them felt boring and uninspired at times :/ 




 Don't worry, the challenge will ramp up soon enough :D


But I agree.  Going through the first few chalices (as I did on my first toon) at a higher level is boring as shit 




 Ah. I forgot about the shield. How much endurance does it take to block bullets from say Evelyn, or a shotgun like the blunderbuss or Ludwig's rifle? 




 To be clear, i am talking strictly PvP. That being said, i dont think ive encountered anyone in the reddit dungeon who doesnt have high or the highest level gems, hence the 2-3 shot meta, and smaller weapons can sill be 3 shot metas easily, but most transformed weapons with the higher gems can kill in two or three shots at the 100-120 meta, and I use it and encounter in almost every PvP match. But hzngr is mostly chikevlyn builds in my experience, so I find myself playing more in nightmare frontier. 


In terms of rounding out the builds that exist, I am fine with that, as a few more AR even on quality weapons will still kill you in the same number of hits. There will be no difference in a 400 vs 500 hubter's axe killing you in 3 hits, or a 700 vs 800 LHB killing you in 2 hits, or a 500 vs 600 chikage killing you in 2 hits (after they've spammed a clip of bullets at you), but at higher levels, you at least have more defence, hopefully more vitality, and all around more EHP. 


Now couple that beyond the souls game mind-set for PvP, and lets have some matches that last longer than the wait period in between them, and what we are really missing is dueling bells or an arena or some way to get rid of the stupid debuff for dedicated PvP fights (vs griefing hosts, which I am fine that the invader can be at a disadvantage).  




 You're still missing the cool sound effects, and I still enjoy the BB (unlocked) ;)
(Though to be fair, I haven't used LHB much in PvP, and I wonder if it would be a good counter to chikage?)


And for every 10 Chikevelyn users I see, I see 0 LHB users.  I think I've seen more wheel users, which are rare enough as is, than LHB :( 


edit:  unlocked BB* 




 I still prefer unlocked BB ;)

(Though to be fair, I haven't used LHB much in PvP)


And for every 10 Chikevelyn users I see, I see 0 LHB users :(  




 I still prefer unlocked BB ;)

(Though to be fair, I haven't used LHB much in PvP)


And for every 10 Chikevelyn users I see, I see 0 LHB users :(  




 Yes, but the equivelant of havel-butt-mage is bullet spam, and some people would rather spam all their bullets away than play the game.  That shit gets old, and it really is the magic spam of this game.  Rarely do I have the patience to wait it out, and that's on me.  Sure, it's a valid way to play the game in the way you want, I just think it's cheesy and boring as fuck -_-


That being said, while I think the PvP is fun in this game, it is also lacking and a step backwards imo, and the 20 second/2-shot meta (between the 2 minute waiting times) kinda sucks.  Gonna back up my toons soon and try the 150 meta for a bit :D 




 But it's a given that LHB is easy to make OP :P  With the damage you listed, I'm guessing that's around 50/50?  Or 50/30? or 40/40?  Or some higher end quality build?  But what the BB lacks in ridiculous damage (as LHB takes the cake in all buikds/fields), it makes up for in finesse and style and cool sound effects. ;)


Also worth noting, as strong as it is for PvE, I hardly see LHB in PvP  




 Scummiest setup? There are like, four or five builds in this game, but I really do hate people who spam shotguns from max range, effectively rooting themselves and flinching me...for no reason, and I do hate eveylyn spammers too, but I digress :P


Honestly,  between the limited weapon options and lack of builds, I don't find this game's gestures to be as insulting as previous games, and with our 20 second/2-3 shot PvP meta, it's hard for me to take this game's PvP as seriously (Fighting super tryhard havel/butthole/jester/assclowns duel wielding katanas shooting crystal soul spears who then do a /mock gesture is a whole different story). 


The other night I was in hizngr and I fought this one chikevelyn guy (most of them usually are), but he was good, and I just couldn't get him, and he'd always kill me in two transformed hits, with or without a few bullet holes.  I nearly got him once, but by the third time I was matched with him again, I couldn't hlep but laugh and do the whole "spare me gesture" thing.  He didn't, and I died again in another two transformed chikage hits.  What can you do?  (/mock myself) 




 Well, I've seen a  lot of people gem and build for the Burial Blade wrong (the hybrid arcane weapons seem to confuse people a lot), so in this case, I mean the correct gems, more than 'the best' gems. 




 Well, it's not OP as easily putting three 27% gems on a chikage or a LHB, but the BB has a bit more style and finesse, and the problem is I've seen a lot of people who don't know how to gem (and build) for it, as the hybrid arcane weapons seem to confuse people a lot :P 




 It's not that the Burial Blade is 'stronger' per se, it just depends on your build and if you are using the correct gems (with the uncanny BB), and it won't be over-powered for you because you will be missing the best-in-slot gems, and you'll be a long way off from being able to farm for them (until you run all the chalices or dreg through a lot of SRRC bullshit for multiple dungeons), so don't sweat it :) 




 If you gem it right you can get 650-700 AR, so not really :D 




 Oh, I agree.  I like playing the build in PvE because it plays quite different than the other builds (nothing to do with it being a katana, I just think this game lacks variety), but I agree with you on the other parts.  The build is very restrictive, the bullet spam is obnoxious and cheesy in PvP, and I wish FROM had at least another BT scaling/powered melee weapon or two, so the BT build wouldn't just be the Chikage/evelyn build.  It's also annoying to not be able to just keep your weapon transformed :D 




 Right.  While I don't want to necessary encourage bullet spam (seriously, fuck off shotgun and eve spammers and play the game :D), vials serve a multititude of roles, and I don't know about you, but I don't find the 20 second/2-3 shot meta all that engaging or exciting.  I like knowing that my opponent and I are free to go all out against each other, and a longer battle has always yielded more satisfaction, as it usually ends due to me catching the opponent with better strategy or skill or wearing him out, rather than a few lucky, laggy, or quick hits.  That's not the best way to put it, and it's sort of hard to describe the difference at the moment, but the 2-3 shot meta is so quick and short, it often feels like the fight is over before it even begins... 




 Ok, I think you missed the point or misunderstood some important things here, so please let me try again :)


Movesets:  Yes, mindlessly spamming anything will get you punished, but I'm not talking about a non-stop R1 spam, rather, quicker attacks in general.  After months of PvP, I hardly see anyone use slow attacks, or charge attacks, because they are just too slow in such a fast paced game.  I hardly see anyone use them in the dozens of PvP videos posted here every week as well.  I'm not saying they aren't used, but they are rarely used, and for good reason:  they are just too easy to punish, and just too slow in a game like bloodborne's PvP.


The DaS Reference -  I don't think you misunderstood me.  That's the point of it.  It's not about judging the game, it's about how the PvP is way different, yet people pretend the stats in BB are the same as stats were in previous souls titles and hold the same weight (ie, this whole argument).  We can't pretend the PvP in this game is the same as the souls titles (with the random meta and stats), and thus, treat it the same


Stats/Sacrafice - Again, this has everything to do with why I am asking people to stop treating this game's PvP and builds the same as FROM's previous titles, because in the past, again, sacrafice was important and thus relevant, but the gains in damage from stats are so minor at present (due to the gems), that the arguments for a lower meta wind up sounding ridiculous, and there is no real reson for it.  So you bump up the meta another 20-25 (or even 50) levels from the present, and even in a damage stat, another 50-200 AR doesn't mean shit (probably not even that much) when we already have a 2-3 shot PvP meta.  If anything, you will have a higher defence, and more HP, so now maybe we can give the PvP in this game the 'something more' that is missing.  At present, most PvP fights feel like a premature ejaculation of blood, as before the fight can even get really interesting, one of us is dead already, and it's even worse if your opponent has a shitty connection.


So you, and every other stubborn person can continue to say *"but if I have a lot of two stats, it will somehow ruin PvP and make my character a jack of all trades",* and I will continue to say *bullshit,* because stats aren't the problem in this game, gems are, and the 20 second/2-3 shot meta of PvP is a fucking joke anyhow.  How could you ruin that?  How can you make yourself any more overpowered than we already are?  It winds up being boring, and what we are missing is more defence and more HP to make these matches more exciting, because I'd rather the matches last longer than the long waiting period in between them.


Going deeper with it: opening up more weapon options on a toon is fun, and the fact that we only have five builds (with a 75-120 meta) and a handful of weapons in this game does not make for the most dynamic PvP, so if you have more options on any character, I see that as a good thing (and this is coming from someone who has around 7 or 8 toons with 4 or 5 different builds each, most of which who have run through all the chalices and are fit for PvP).


Again, this became redundant awhile ago, but the arguments for the arbitrary lower meta are sounding more and more ridiculous, stubborn, and dated to me, and other than arguments that were relevant to past SOULS games, I think they have no place in Bloodborne. 




 Great. So we want to turn the 30 second/2-3 shot meta into the 20 second/one-shot meta? :P 




 Cool. Glad I could help.  Like I and others have said, just don't expect a prequel to bloodborne. The combat is still floaty, yet tight and weighty. Definitely worth your entertainment dollar value either way. Let us know what you think :) 




  I'm pretty sure everyone understood my sarcasm and humor there, hence the polite and humorous comments and upvotes ;) 




 Salmon Odors? 




 LOL. Hey it's me, the other guy. My post was more akin to satire - just google any old weird and random shit on the internet and it probably exists.  Dont look too far into it or consider it too creepy, as I'm not the weirdo dressing up and playing hunter-doll fantasies. :D


Edit:  the point is, stop being such a pervert ;) 




 You sure it's not soggy original? 0_o 




 I just beat the hell out of them, alternating between killing the most aggressive nippon steel asshole first (as he is super easy to parry-visceral), then I kill candle boy, and I leave flame faggot for last because you can get right in his face and bash his shadows in, while his fireballs sail right over your head.  Also, don't let them do their snake dance and summon the Giant Katana boas - you can interupt this attack, so if you see them going for the snake-geyser ritual, slap the shit out of them.

Also, you could always use a Shaman bone blade :P 




 BloodPorn!  I dig it!  Next game for the franchise! 




 I hated the cane, not because the damage seemed weak, but the moveset itself just felt so clumsy and floppy and lacked a good impact, like the slice of the cleaver or the heft of the axe. :D 




 Eh, As a long time soul player, I had a similar experience myself.  The game fealt very easy, aside a few spots in the main story line where the difficulty seemingly ramped up quite a bit, but once I got past that, it was back to smooth sailing again.  But that being said, don't get too complacent, as I feel there are definately a few areas that will kick even a familiar player's ass, but now that I look back, I still feel like it was a very linear and relatively quick and easy game :/ 




 There are only two:  Chikage and Evelyn.  One of the most fun builds to play, but one of the "cheesier" and more obnoxious builds to fight against in PvP.  Just dodge all the bullet spams, play it safely until they run out of bullets (like arcane spam in DaS), then go in for the attacks, or if you're like me, lose patience and run in between all the bullets towards your foe and then be 2 shot by a transformed Chikage :D 




 Go to nightmare.  You'll see more than Chikevelyns and shot-gun spammers :P 




 pew.  pew.  pew.  pew. pew...

Even more annoying, the shotgun users:

bang.  bang.  bang.  bang....

Ok, you're rooted in place, and I got a piece of buck-shot in my groin that staggers me for a second, but where is this getting us?  Can we play the game now? 




 This post may contain spoilers?  How about the title :D 




 Haha.  This made me LOL.  Thanks :D 




 Eh, they could have just had the messengers ring the bells for you in place, that would function just like a summon sign, but with BB aesthethics.  Honestly, the bells are clunky and annoying as shit, and as much as I love co-op, I hate the resonant bell because it gets old having to play hide and seek with the host everytime I spawn in on the other side of their map.  I don't find that to be enjoyable, and it doesn't contribute to my immersion.  I love PvP and the sinister bell is about the easiest to use in the PvP areas, but it is still slow, and the summoning/invading times for PvP are almost always longer than the matches themselves :/ 




 I hate it.  It is clunky, ineffective, and a waste of resources (as it uses insight right away).  Worth noting, I've only ever used the beckoning bell once or twice for the hell of it, and I use the small resonant bell and the sinister bell a lot.   


They should have just converted the summon/dueling signs into messenger bells, where, instead of writing your sign on the ground, your messengers sit there ringing the bells for you, but they operate the same exact way the summon signs did, that way they could have kept the effectiveness of the summon signs, and stayed true to the aesthethic of Bloodborne.


I remember seeing an interview or features list just prior to release (from a credible source) mentioning bell maidens and seamless multiplayer...seamless my ass, this has been the clunkiest, most obnoxious multiplayer to date.  Also, the resonant bells are annoying as hell, as I hate playing hide and seek with the host when I spawn in his world on the other side of the map 


Edit:  Forgot to mention that the SRRC was a good idea, but it is a total piece of shit as well :/ 




 Yes, Bloodborne is a master-piece to be sure, but even then, the PvE story line is short, linear, and fairly easy, though the awesome level design hides that fact pretty well :/
