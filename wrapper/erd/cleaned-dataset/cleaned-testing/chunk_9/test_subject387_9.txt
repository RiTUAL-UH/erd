 Jesse Eisenberg is so small compared to everyone else. 




 5'10'' actually. 




 The master must take his rightful place back on the throne. 




 The girls all look so tan! 




 First thing I thought of. Both Katie and Emily look really blond. 




 I like you, /u/munsterx3. We should be friends. 




 FUCK I WAS NOT READY FOR THIS 




 The fuck with that nose. 




 The actual mask portion of the helmet looks quite odd. 




 Yeah, Sara is much more bustier than her sister, Laurel. 




 Thank you!~ 




 What episode did he petition to rename the city? 




 I see. Any possible reason for renaming though? 




 Woah, that makes a lot of sense. I'm definitely going to try mixing it up and using broken rhythm in my next sparring match. Is there a way I can read up more of Bruce Lee's theories such as this? 




 good observation 




 What do you mean by that? 




 "Accidentally." 




 And really gruesome. I bet it hurt. 




 FUCK that looks bad. 




 That front kick didn't *seem* that powerful at all. But it must've hit pretty hard though if his opponent instinctively lowered his hands to block it though. 




 yes 




 I remember that too! 









 call him what you want, he can still fuck you up 




 Apparently it's working fine for /u/Rob3122. That's weird. 




 It's not cutting off for you? 




 Great analysis. Thoroughly enjoyed your commentary. Good points. 




 That's full on peepee!!

lol'd 




 ur ding dong floats around like a water snake

I'm fucking done. 




 Can't believe he got caught with that TWICE. 




 Not one, but TWO Spinning Hook Kicks? What the fuck. 




 Lyoto machida isn't something to joke about 




 What do you mean "tagged" ?? 




 [Fun Fact: Christian Bale, who played Batman in Nolan's TDK Trilogy, also sang the song in the trailer in an emotional scene from the movie, The Fighter.](https://youtu.be/Ya7fHKVObSo?t=64) 




 Oh my god, she's gorgeous. 




 Wow, that just goes to show how much faster RF is than Barry. Great theory, thanks for the reply. I enjoyed reading it. 




 Oh, I see. So he was kind of over-emphasizing it and "Star City" might not even be mentioned in Season 4.  But yeah Star City and Green Arrow go hand-in-hand as Gotham to Batman and Metropolis to Superman. 




 Look at /u/unwittynamehere's comment. It's not the same one. 




 Look at /u/unwittynamehere's comment. It's not the same one. 




 Same 




 I agree. 




 As in a different city?? 




 WHITE LOGO, WHERE IS IT!????? 




 But how did he actually "beat himself up" though? Also, what's the point in having the Hologram when Speed Mirages already help him be in two places at once? 









 Definitely wrong link. 




 How'd you know what the real link was? 




 A gay Mr. Terrific. Interesting. 




 I know Starling City is supposed to represent Star City, Green Arrow's city much like Gotham is to Batman or Bludhaven is to Nightwing, but did that Intro by Stephen Amell/Oliver Queen at SDCC hint at Starling City's renaming to Star City? 




 Happy Cake Day. 




 Wow, that was really obvious. Thank you very much for pointing it out for me, I would've never gotten it. I was trying to look for something deeper lol 




 I really don't understand the joke. Seriously. Can someone please explain? 




 What the hell? Those aren't the lyrics to Gotta Go Fast 




 that was a trip 




 MOVING AT THE SPEED OF SOUND 




 Does TARS stand for "The Armored Robot Suit" ?? 




 What does TARS stand for? 




 The Armored Robot Suit? 




 *The Red Capes are coming~* 




 What does TARS stand for!??? 




 And then he pulls out the Kryptonite. 




 Dark Knight trilogy was pretty good, didn't you think? 




 I hope so. The fact that Batman would wear a military uniform over his batsuit is pretty ridiculous but then again wearing a batsuit is ridiculous in of itself. 




 What the fuck is he wearing. 




 Holy fuck, that's beautiful. 




 You can say that, but Silva is definitely drilling some Wing Chun techniques here. 




 Her tits seem way smaller too 




 Ah, the lead leg cut kick/side kick. Yeah, tall fighters love that technique because it optimizes their long range. I hate it too and it's difficult to get past, I usually try to angle out.


Edit: I thought you were referring to blocking kicks with the shin. 




 Ah, I see. That's happened to me a few times as well when there was no one my equal weight at my current belt level.

Thank you for the tips and videos, but what do you mean my leg check? Checking kicks is illegal in WTF Taekwondo, isn't it? 




 No worries, thanks bro! 




 Why were you up against such heavier fighters at 155 lbs? That's extremely unfair and defeats the purpose of having weight categories.

Despite that I'm so glad you managed to came victorious and unharmed. That inspires me to work hard and keep a strong fighting spirit.

What's your strategy against taller, heavier fighters? 




 I agree, I like your shot. 




 Thanks for letting me know, upvoted. Sorry about that.

EDIT: Do you happen to have the link to the original post? I want to read the comments. 




 I think your best option now is to remain blue belt as long as you possibly can before it becomes obvious that you should move up a belt

I will take that advice. Thank you very much. I'm also a pretty light fighter, constantly drifting from 135-145ish not really staying consistent because local tournaments don't weight color belts, they just size them up based on looks. I will go to Qualifiers next year at 128 lbs and, eventually, as a Black Belt I will compete at Fin, lowest, at 120 lbs.

You're worrying that you will not be leaving behind a legacy like theirs but you only have good thinks to look forward to, you're young and have lots of potential.

Thank you very much for your reassurance. For awhile I haven't felt young anymore because I'm not a Junior yet at the same time I'm not old enough 30+ to where I'm just doing this for recreation like the older crowd and parents in the adult classes.  But you're right, I'm still young and I can only grow from here. My goal is to win a National Championship under my belt.  Even if I'll only ever win as a color belt, I would be proud of myself if I can claim the Gold next year.  Looking forward to all the progress ahead of me! 

If I may ask, were you nervous at all to compete as a Black Belt for the first time? Or had it just felt like any other competition.

 crosspost from /r/martialarts. The community there is more active so I posted there initially but this is where this post really fits:

Hey, /r/taekwondo... I'm in an awkward position. As a Blue Belt in Taekwondo with close to two years of training under my belt, I figure I'm doing alright at my level. I've done well at each local tournament sanctioned by the USAT since switching over to a USAT Taekwondo Dojang. 

A year ago I never would've thought I would be able to do the things I'm doing now. I just wanted to do Taekwondo for recreation since I always loved watching Martial Arts films featuring Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee with those athletic kicks they displayed on-screen. The initial dojang I started with was part of a chain of several dojangs and, unfortunately, the particular dojang I trained at was not very good - at least for me. [It was such a bad fit for me that at one point I considered quitting Taekwondo altogether.](https://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/2hb00k/should_i_drop_taekwondo_for_muay_thai/)

Thankfully, I listened to your guys' advice and found a great dojang that I transferred to. I have a good relationship with my coach/master, I consider him an uncle, as well as many of the students that I train with. Amazingly, since I started training over here, my skills have improved tremendously since I started. So much so that watching old videos of me sparring from when I was still training over at my previous dojang makes me cringe.

The dojang I currently train under has produced very many successful Taekwondo competitors. Several National Champions, USA National Team Members, and countless other achievements have been born from here. A year ago I never would've thought that I would be able to potentially compete at such a high level but now, knowing so, it makes me afraid to try.

This year following the National USA Taekwondo Tournament in Austin, Texas we have 4 students from our Dojang that qualified to make the National Team, 2 of which will be competing in the Cadet World Championships in Korea.

I'm amazed at how good everyone around me is... however, that's also what makes me somewhat disappointed...

I'm 18 years old. A lot of these guys have been training since they were little kids and have kept training for over 6-10+ years. Everyone that has done exceptionally well, like capture a Title [ex: National Champion], have done so under 18.  If you don't quite follow what I'm saying yet, you will.

I've met a lot of great martial artists, Black Belts, here since I started. We had a bunch of them that were 18+, or turning 17-18 [AKA making the Senior Division - sparring in the 18-32 age group] that were doing really well but eventually stopped competing competitively, or quit altogether.  Unfortunately some of them were also kicked out of the dojang for coming in and teaching classes under the influence.

The circle of high-level Black Belts in the Senior Division is not very big. Therefore, all the big names are well-known. As a kid you have plenty of opportunities to compete, but the problem for me... as an Adult is that the guys in the Black Belt Senior Division have kept training since they were a kid and are *exceptionally* outstanding.

So much so that people stop competing once they reach Senior age because they're afraid or they see that they've reached the end of their journey as a competitor and they cannot go any further.

I'm afraid this is what will happen to me when I reach Black Belt next year. 

Last night I went out with a couple of my friends, Black Belts from the dojang, and they talked about all the great competitors that used to train here.  Though I didn't know any of them, personally, I do know they were really successful during their career.  Unfortunately, I felt really left out since I couldn't relate to any of what they were saying or what they've accomplished. 

When I leave for University in a year or so, will I be remembered at all?  For anything...

I started Taekwondo when I was 17 and I'm turning 19 soon... so I never had the opportunity to spar at a less-extreme level of competition. Even now, it's not that intense because I'm still a color belt but like I said earlier, the circle of Black Belt Senior competitors isn't especially huge compared to Junior Black Belts or even Senior/Junior Color Belts. (There are guys that could very well qualify for the Olympics in this division, even at just the National Level Competitions)

I regret not starting Martial Arts earlier when I was a kid. I wish I had more opportunities to grow, earn more tournament experience, and make mistakes before I had to compete in the Senior Division.

For now, I'm okay... as I'm still a Color Belt but the fact that my coach and my friends around me push me to promote to the next level worries me.  I don't feel like I deserve to move up to Red Belt, which is right underneath Black.  That would put a lot of pressure on me to have a high-level of skill - which I do not possess as of yet...
I like where I'm at because I think it suits me.  I'm not a beginner and I'm not really experienced enough to be advanced. Blue Belt... right in the middle - Intermediate.  I think that describes me well.

A year ago I was always excited for the next belt promotion but now that I'm doing Taekwondo not just for recreation but for competition, the next promotion just worries me.  I don't think I'm good enough. I don't think I deserve what's ahead of me... at the same time, I can't just stay here forever.  What is life without progress?

In the Senior Black Belt Division, all Black Belts are put up against one another in each weight class regardless of the level of their experience as a Black Belt.  You can have someone who just got their 1st Degree and has been training for 3 years go up against someone that's been a Black Belt for 3 years and has been training for over 10 years consecutively altogether... 

That's worries me the most... especially seeing how one of the coaches, who personally coached me for a National Qualifier Tournament last year, from another chain dojang that was tied to my previous dojang is now a USA National Champion in the Senior Division.  Knowing that in a year or so that I could potentially be put up against him since we could be in the same weight division scares me.

I'm stuck. I keep choking... seeing how all my friends that have done so well eventually dropped out after they've reached Senior Division age or after just a few competitions in that Division.

Once I reach Black Belt, will my career as a competitor also be over?

 They're moving in herds. They do move in herds. 




 Don't be mean. 




 Bro, no spoiler tag!?????????? 




 Well... for reference Cisco even pointed out the **brighter red** on the Future Flash costume along with the white emblem in the newspaper from Well's secret room. I can pull a quote from the episode if you would like.

And EDIT: I did screen that myself. 




 too soon? no chill. 




 photoshop 




 With proper lighting it looks substantially brighter. I screened a part where the light reflected on his costume. Anything can look dark in bad lighting. http://i.imgur.com/ZuN32CM.png 




 Dude, I was referring to Future Barry in comparison to the main Barry. It's obvious the suit has remained the same shade of red, however there's no dying how bright red Future Barry's suit was in the finale compared to main Barry. Don't downvote me for that. 




 What was your weight when you first started 




 Down to that sharp nose. 




 very nice. 




 Not as bright as Future Barry though 




 The costume's a totally brighter red though.  




 Future Barry's suit was too bright red to look like this 




 THE WHITE EMBLEM!????? 




 Great video loved that ending part, thought it was just going to be a typical hype trailer till that glitchy ending. Got me hooked. 




 Well, she's known this guy from back in Hawaii. I'm her only friend other than the people who train at the gym in this city as of now so I'm not worried about out-of-state competition. But if she won't even talk to the guy closest to her, in the literal sense, then yeah it's a lost cause. She's a cool girl, at the very least I want to keep her around even if it means putting her off. Thanks for the comment. 

I had a strong feeling we were gonna get together or hook up the first night but I didn't want to go too forward because it seemed way too soon so, maybe I missed my opportunity or maybe I did the right thing. Only time will tell I guess. 




 Thanks a lot man. Your post made me feel better. Haha. Been kind of down on myself by over reading the situation. Was afraid I already fucked everything up. So, just go on about, chatting and making small talk as usual and ask her out for lunch or something later this week would be okay?
 




 Yeah I agree. Should've stopped sooner. But, I don't know. I just wanted to send her a nice text. Wasn't trying to be clingy or forward, just wanted to let her know I think she's cool and I like her. Girls like a sweet text every now and then.

I guess I fucked up though.  




 Thanks again man. That's perfect. Just gotta see how she reacts today and that'll give me my answer right there... 

just say "I have a lot on your mind" and sorry reply, sound a little sarcastic

Not really sure what you meant here? "I have a lot on *your*(not my) mind. Sorry"  




 I sure hope as hell that you weren't driving pointlessly just so you could talk to a girl. 4 hours of wasting gas and time? Daamn bro. Talking aint everything, should have flirted with her and set up a date and then escalate,

Gotta lay down that groundwork brah. She said she's down to kick with me when there's a party or alcohol.  




 Would she be down for that if she didn't respond...? Kind of afraid not responding means she totally is not into me anymore even at the slightest.  




 Okay, good points man. 

That tension you felt when the moment seemed right to kiss her but you talked yourself out of it? Don't let that happen again.

Agreed. 


Stop with being her taxi and BFF or at least give her the silent trip for the ride and if you do give her a ride try to kiss her. 

At this point, I'm not quite sure what I can say or do to lead up to this kiss. I kind of feel like I fucked up last night, I know it was just a txt convo but still. If it's just a silent ride... I don't want her to feel awkward or anything but yeah that'll give her the message.

I can't do both though. What do you think I should do? Obviously, I can't give her a silent trip *and* try to kiss her. And I can't just do it out the blue without any prior convo/lead up. 

Eh, my bad if I'm being difficult.

I just feel like there's still potential here and I want to salvage every last bit of it. 

Really appreciate the advice.
 




 Yeah, I suppose you're right. Still bothers me on why she decided to be so blunt, but what can I do? 

I guess you could do it at the end of the drive before you leave the car. Just say something like "lets finish this conversation on Friday night, I'd like to take you out for drinks".

Not drinking age yet haha but I'll ask her if she wants to grab a bite to eat this Saturday since I'm off work. Hopefully she's off work too but, even so, if she's into me she'll try to make time. Thanks, man. I'll ask her out when I drop her off. 

Assuming she doesn't think I'm a totally fucking dunce and get a ride from someone else tonight lol. 




 Okay, yeah. You're right. What should I ask then when I see her again? I mean, I really don't know if there are any parties coming up. Asking her if she wants to see a movie might be too cheesy and easily flawed. Can't think of anything to do and we've pretty much been hanging out already in the car.

I want to make a remark at her about that dead-convo last night though just to see if I can pry something out of her. Should I be like, "By the way, you suck at texting for someone who loves talking, haha" or something? I want to know what's/what was on her mind. 




 you should of made one of the going home rides into a mini date maybe like lets stop for a drink, food something. 

I did, but she said she doesn't eat past 7 because of cutting weight. Went through a drive-thru to get us some drinks though. At several points I did want to kiss her and I felt like it would've been perfect but I didn't want it to be so soon since I've literally started talking to her for like two days.

Didn't feel like I was overtexting her, but the conversation definitely ended short.

I'm seeing her again tonight when I pick up her up for class, should I mention/bring up that text convo from last night? Also, how would you suggest I "fix" this? 




 Yeah, but I've only talked to her for two days. She seems really cool. Worth putting in some more effort. 

Should I bring up/ask her if everything was okay last night after I dropped her off when I see her again today? 




 I mean had to provide some context to really emphasize/show how it was so sudden. I'm picking her up again today, should I bring up that texting convo from last night?

EDIT: Added a tl;dr. 




 Thanks for the clarification 




 Piccolo is also a Tower. 




 Thank you very much! 




 Thanks for clarifying for him /u/CallMeBanjo. Guess I could've put "TIL  that at 5'11'', Post-Timeskip Naruto is taller than 5'9'' Goku" for the people who can't read. 









 So far three of my teammates made National Team! Hooray! Congrats on qualifying. Better save up now so you can be National Champion next year :) 




 Understood, thank you! Hayk, I'm a long-time fan of your videos. Have you ever considered trying out for the Olympics? I honestly believe you would do very well if you chose to go that route. 




 So... real? 




 Wait. Naruto and Hinata have the sex??? 




 Beautiful display of technique and agility. Been a long-time fan of your videos, keep up the great work!! /r/martialarts is a fan of your work too. I posted one of your videos there and it got a lot of positive responses https://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/31joyw/taekwondo_v_kickboxing_good_example_of_how/ 




 DUDE. I've seen your Kickboxing videos, you inspire me SOOOO much. Thank you for posting those videos. You inspire me. 

Can you give me any advice for fighting stronger, taller opponents? 




 Apparently handseals are bullshit. 




 Like Dare-Devil. 




 What does TnJ do? 




 Ryan Higa 




 Spider-Man  - Sam Raimi

The Amazing Spider-Man (Remake) - Mark Webb

Upcoming Spider-Man (Remake)  - Marvel

That's two remakes. 




 ...right. They probably use it to sell to other advertising markets for profit. 









 Why THE FUCK does it need my Street Address? 




 what the hell does that mean 




 Still only have one remaining arm? If so, why didn't he opt to get another one? 




 The Cross Fingers isn't a traditional seal. Apparently it is it's own unique seal. 




 Rewritten, ALREADY? Jesus. This is almost as bad as having two Spider-Man remakes within the last 15 years. 




 The Red Hair and skinny body is fucking stupid for a transformation into a God. I'm sick of this Blue/Red Hair fairytale-lookin bullshit. I just want to stick with the hardcore Super Saiyan Golden hair. 









 I TRIED SO HARD, AND GOT SO FAR. BUT *IN THE END* IT DIDN'T EVEN MATTER.
