 Can't argue that a light heavyweight has more power than a middleweight, but I was more or less comparing their power to their respective weight class. In that sense, I think Hopkins faces the same kind of force at a different weight.

I just don't think GGG takes the bait. Hopkins will definitely try because he has the edge with experience and mind games, but Golovkin is so disciplined it's scary. He doesn't buy into other people's tricks. I say he sticks his ground and comes at B-Hop with everything he has by round 2 or 3. 

OK, so you think GGG wins the fight, and I couldn't agree more, but does B-Hop go the distance? I think that's probably the bigger question. No way GGG carries him in an effort to entertain the fans like he did with Murray and Monroe.  




 Hopkins is without question an all-time legend, and he did put in one hell of an effort against Kovalev. However, when it comes to shutting down the ring and closing in on opponents, GGG gets a significant edge over Kovalev in that department. While their punching power may be comparable, I don't think B-Hop will go the distance against GGG. Golovkin's style would require Hopkins to be more mobile and at 50 years old his legs aren't going to give him many miles to work with. 

That said, we all know Hopkins won't retire on his stool, but I'd hate to see him be another example of a guy who should've thrown in the towel earlier in his career. His loss to Kovalev was admirable, but he was shut out on every scorecard. He won't fair any better against GGG and personally I think the risk is even greater for him.

Would I watch? Absolutely. Would I cringe in anticipation every time Golovkin corner B-Hop? Without question. 

I would hate to see him go out like that. Golovkin is hailed for commanding the ring and every opponent he faces downtalks it leading up to the fight. Then the first thing they overcome is the fact that they blinked and suddenly they're cornered halfway through the second round.  




 Agreed. The first thing that came to mind is, "Damn, Bernard wants to go out on his shield." It would without a doubt be his last fight. 




 A friend of mine texted me from a business trip to Finland earlier this year. "Everyone here is so nice" he said. Then I sent him a story about Simon Hayha and he responded with, "Now I don't know what to think." 




 Holy crap.  




 My grandfather served in Guadalcanal and Iwo Jima. He was a Seabee and was first to touch down in both of those places. As he used to say, "Marines brag about being the first one there, but we were always waiting on the beach to shake their hands."

Anyways, one night on one of the islands his crew was attacked by Japanese forces. They dove into tents, ran in with grenades, etc. My grandfather single handily saved his tent-mate by choking an attacker to death before picking up a bayonet and killing "a few" before the enemy retreated into the brush. A lot of guys in his group would collect ears of the enemy in mason jars, but he admitted that it was too close to insanity for him. He'd take sashes or knives, if anything at all.

Another time he was in the hull of a ship surrounded by live ammunition during a bombing raid. Every man in there knew they were one hit away from being decimated. No one said anything. They all just sat in silence and waited, for good or bad. 

He never really liked to talk about it but he opened up about it to my mother one day when I was really young. Part of me thinks he really wanted to make sure people knew his story.  




 I don't like stories like this. I'm not supposed to feel feelings.  




 And the one-man show directed by Spike Lee is pretty solid too.  




 I've been meaning to read this for months.  




 Oh no doubt. Just backing your statement up with the fact that tons of guys do get that sort of thing. I remember reading that Pascal hired his therapist after the Hopkins fight, citing the specific instance when in round 10 (I believe) B-Hop dropped to the matt and did push ups in between rounds. Meanwhile Pascal was sitting on his stool praying to catch his breath. He came out of that one, got the therapist, and then beat Bute. 

And I'm sure the therapist did wonder for B-Hop. After all, for as much as he talks, his mental game is on point.   




 Wow, you're not kidding. I just did about a dozen searches on various book sites and this thing is nowhere to be found. Sorry friend.  




 Good Lord that was one hell of a KO. Lights out, falls like a tree. Unreal. Thanks for the post.  




 Is that Larry Merchant? They all sound the same to me.  




 Pretty cool.  




 I sometimes feel like Bernard takes one long, monstrous, deep breath when he wakes up in the morning and slowly deflates throughout the course of the day as he continues to talk more and more.  




 And Pascal. And Hopkins. A lot of guys, come to think of it.  




 And then when he does make weight he makes a mockery of it like he did for Vera II - http://bit.ly/1e69wfU 




 That was great. Thanks for sharing. I can't believe how the Romans were forced to sit there and just take onslaught after onslaught of Parthian arrows.

Also, as someone who just got into archery as a hobby, that bit about the compound bow and the origins of the term "parting shot" was really cool.  




 "You won't like me when I'm hungryyyy." 




 In the end he'll only be a disgrace to the name. He should've just pursued his career in competitive eating. He'd beat Kobayashi easily. I call HDE 55 (Hot Dog Eating, by a difference of 55). 




 Looks like they were in an atrium of sorts. Casting weird shadows on everyone.  




 A lot of the series I've read have done a pretty good job on their own of subtly reminding the reader about a character, plot or story during the course of reading the new book. 

The Strain, The Dark Elf Trilogy (or anything by R.A. Salvatore, really) Harry Potter all come to mind.  




 Damn. You beat me to the Douglas Adams inspired pick. ;-) 




  It's way different when what you're hitting can hit you back.

Exactly. It's the same theory that applies to how great guys look in training camp hitting the bag or working the mitts before they get laid out in the ring.
