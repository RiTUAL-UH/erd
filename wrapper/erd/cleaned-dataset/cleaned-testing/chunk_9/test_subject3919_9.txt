 this is not a tattoo though 









 those stupid little things always got everywhere 




 You're not very speedy if you're stopping to comment 




 YOU'RE A DOG !?!?!?! 




 I agree that wanting something for your own platform shouldn't be viewed as peasantry.  But don't forget PCMR was a circlejerk at first and has sort of evolved into a pseudo-circlejerk; so I wouldn't get to worked up about it. 




 Well it would cost them some money possibly, but it is normal to update new games regularly in the first year or so. I don't think them putting it on console would be out of the question.

 *slam* **AHHHHHHHH** 




 It's sad that I saw this as a normal thing when I first watched it. I don't play any sports, but living in Canada my whole life this behavior just seemed normal. (yes I know; its an american team) 




 *TIPS FEDORA* 




 I think Mountain is under 1 euro, that is an interesting game 




 She bounced around like a grand theft auto NPC 




 It looks like the church from The Vanishing of Ethan Carter 




 I live right on a border town (canada/america) on the canadian side. There are lots of billboards you can see coming over the border. I have always wanted to put "welcome to america!" on one of them just to confuse people. 




 NARP THE KING

 A big floppy dick that says "8 inches of grinches" (for a "friend") 




 Fuck I remember when I played terraria after it first came out and all the boss fights would do that to me. 









 ...?
 




 Sure, but if you only show me how to use magic like harry potter. (in other words Sherlock is fiction) 




 and broken mirror 




 For those who don't know the Garden of Gethsemane is the garden depicted in the holy bible where Jesus prayed the night before his crucifixion. 




 No thank you that would ruin loot as bad as the vending machines did tps 




 Starred Up 









 Seems to fit my liking for games. I love parkour based movement and survival stuff. I'm just wondering if the game is of $60 quality 




 You have a nice smile 




 umm... ok 




 Look at the pole in his hands 









 You realize that Fallout and TES are made by different groups under Bethesda. They are undoubtedly working on both. 




 Thank you! 














 You look a little like Jim Gaffigan 




 I love my G230's they such good headphones for the price

 The souls series is worth a look 









 *Beaver Dam

 #**PLEASE TAKE MY UPJEWS** 




 It loses some of its no-context effect if you tell us the context was someone talking about killing humans 




 If you're looking for replay try darksouls

 Awesome! Looks kinda like a LOTR orc though 




 So I should keep punching strangers? Awesome! 




 submachine?
 




 TIL you're all worse than I previously thought 




 A common thing among people who cannot whistle is they don't even do anything with their tongue. Try putting the tip of your tongue against your 2 front bottom teeth and  pushing your tongue forward so it's bending downward at the front. The raise the sides of your tongue so they touch your top molars. Now purse your lips and blow gently. Hope this helps. 




 That's horrifying  




 not really for a small town. It usually includes the people from neighboring towns too. 




 I switched too and turns out Kickass torrents is really good! 




 I got it free with my GTX 970 and I'm enjoying it, but it's definitely not prime and has a lot of bugs. I like the narrative though and would recommend it if you've got 50$ to blow and no other games you want. 




 Not really...

:(

 Gone home is a great game and made me tear up.
