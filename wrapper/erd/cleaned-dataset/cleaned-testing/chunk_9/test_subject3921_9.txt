 Appreciated! 




 Just a yes or no please. Thanks. 









 Taxi Driver, this movie had some of the most intense moments I've ever seen and DeNiro was great! Love Scorsese.  




 Same here, great performance. 









 Gangs of New York. Daniel Day-Lewis was so evil in that movie but his character was such a bad ass I couldn't help but root for him. Also, DiCaprio annoyed the shit out of me most of the movie and I desperately wanted to see Day-Lewis come out on top.  




 Guardians of the Galaxy 

Edit: I do not mean the part with his mom dying...I am referring to when he's dancing to Come And Get Your Love by Redbone in the cave. Sorry that may have been misleading. 




 Godfather, Argo, American History X. 




 How could you possibly like any of these movies.  




 127 Hours. That is a movie that I very much enjoy and it is all about a man who has to survive in a canyon for a couple of days after a giant rock pins his arm. James Franco delivers an amazing performance and the film has a great ending.

 This is sort of a bromance and romance movie, but the movie I Love You, Man is hilarious and very enjoyable.
