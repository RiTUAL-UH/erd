 I'm trying to pursue teaching abroad in Asia, and most programs require TESOL as well as a basic elementary English degree. I (currently) have no plans on teaching in the states for a long time. 




 I did consider the cost, but when I had just started middle school my dad moved and also made my mom uproot her life and move to NC so I could get a "head start" on getting in-state tuition for UNC (for residency requirements are that you have to live here five years I think).  




 Its required to teach English abroad in Asia, which is what I plan on doing.  




 How does she like teaching TSOL? I've been interested in it for soo long and I'm very excited to join the program if I go to MSU

 




 I plan on joining Teachers Without Borders after college, so I haven't really given it much thought. Thanks for the advice about the teaching license.  




 Basically, my dad went out of the country (San Miguel de Allende, Mexico to Bostom, MA) for college and he HATED it. He doesn't want me to feel isolated and alone in a different state. Him not paying 50% for out of state tuition is a way to try to get me to stay in state, which I have always been adamantly protesting since my sophomore year...

 I have visited MSU and I genuinely like the relaxed feel the student body has. I feel that itd would be much easier for me to graduate near the top of my class with amazing grades. But on the other hand, UNC is more prestigious but I feel as if my grades wont be up to standard. 

 




 Going in for a major is English Education and a minor is TSOL! :) 

They are one of the only universities that offer TSOL as not only a major, but a minor as well so thats what really won me over. 

 




 Well, for MSU my mom and dad (divorced) are co-paying 50%, while I pay 25% with work-study and the rest is covered by merit scholarships. On the other hand, if I attend Chapel Hill my dad agreed to pay the full tuition. 

And thank you for the tip. I'm going to brainstorm pros and cons right now!

 




 My dad has always loved UNC Chapel Hill, and its one of the reasons why my family moved to North Carolina when I was in middle school, in hopes that I would attend UNC.

Two days ago I got my acceptance letter, and although i was thrilled, i told my family i had never even planned on going (I got a fee waiver and thats why I initially applied on a whim). I find that I will be happier up north at Michigan State, and although my mom and her side of the family is all for me going to MSU, my dad and his side of the family want me to attend Chapel Hill.

Well, I have tried explaining to my dad that I don't think I will do well at Chapel Hill because my grades weren't stellar, but my extra curriculars were what got me in. I dont think I will excel academically because the level of intelligence at Chapel Hill is so much higher, as well as the competition. I also find that I like the student dynamics more at MSU where there is more diversity and more suited towards my personality. 

I've tried explaining to my dad but he will have none of it and has even shunned me for today because I told him that I will NOT attend chapel hill. 


How do I go about this? I dont want him to keep ignoring me, but I also don't want to sacrifice my happiness and well-being over a school.


**tl;dr**: My dad is unhappy that I'm making an adult decision about my own future.

Edit: Since people are asking about financials, here's the breakdown:

If I attend MSU, my mom and dad pay $10,000 EACH (so $20,000), I cover $10,000 with the work study I have been offered, and I have a merit scholarship for ($10,000)a scholarship for out of state ($7,000 and a scholarship for having studied abroad ($2,000) 

If I attend chapel hill, my dad will pay $25,000 full.

Edit 2: Maybe my question was unclear, I'm asking for advice on how to speak to my dad and find a way to discuss the different opinions we have about college. 




 Last year I was diagnosed with GAD, and my parents opted not to put me on medication. At the beginning of the school year we decided to try Buspirone. I was advised that it would take up to a month for it to take effect, but I still have anxiety attacks (though they're only mild instead of severe). 

Has anyone had a good experience with BuSpar? 




 I would say to just be friendly! I'm very shy around strangers and at first I was PETRIFIED when people randomly hugged me (mostly the younger convention goers do this), and when people asked for pictures I always said yes. 

Of course there will be creeps, but generally everyone is there to nerd out :)

One suggestion is to bring snacks and drinks if the venue allows it, because the food they sell is almost always overpriced and terrible. Another thing to bring is a travel kit with tiny scissors, a couple tiny spools of thread, a needle, and a small tube if superglue. They're usually sold at craft stores, and they're so useful if you need a touch up or if a fellow cosplayer needs one. 

I hope you have fun! :) 




 she looks like the kind of girl that would set your dog on fire when you dump her  




 Wow thanks for the compiled list! I couldn't find anyone who had made a chalice that was lightweight, because many people made it with clay, which I've never used before.

 I'll check out all the links and see which method would be the easiest. Thank you so much :) 




 I LOVE this! If you dont mind me asking, how did you paint the hammer? I have all the supplies and the paint, but I dont know if I should just paint it solid brown and then create the "wood" look by layering it with dark brown/black...

 




 I'm planning on making a [FFCC chalice] (http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080417022815/finalfantasy/images/3/31/Ffcc_crystalchalice.jpg) for Animazement Raleigh in May and I don't know where to start. I've only been in the cosplay scene for approximately 2 years, and this is the second prop that I'm going to try to make.

I was thinking of creating a wire frame around a plastic fishbowl and then covering the frame with paper mache, but I'm not sure if the end result will look "rough". 

How else could I make the chalice? I'm open to any suggestions!  




 I'm a little behind as well but I think Harley is only *attracted* to Deadshot because she sees the Joker in him. Harley/the Joker are forever my favorite couple, though.  




 God this is my dream room   




 5 centimeters per second 




 Basically just call her super Goth and creepy (style wise), and musically they shit on her vocals and say her voice is depressing and makes them want to kill themselves.  




 I never even realized that! I LOVE the eye makeup they do for the "Diamond Are a Girls Best Friend" scene   




 I guess its just the people in my area, but even on the radio station the disk jokies poke fun at her voice because its not the typical pop voice  




 Definitely Moulin Rouge. Nicole Kidman looked KILLER as well as the rest of the ladies! 




 First of all, that lip color is perfect on you! My only CC is that your blush looks very strong, so I would either try to blend it out more or find a lighter shade 




 *breathing intensifies*
