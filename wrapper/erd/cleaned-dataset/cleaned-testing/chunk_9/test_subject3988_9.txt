  fulfill

to realize, perform or do, as duty; obey or follow, as commands 




 "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.  I have come not to abolish but to fulfill them.  Amen, I say to you, **until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law, until all things have taken place**." 

Jesus breaking old testament laws while he claims to be here to fulfill them is just another case of the bible's contradictions. That's pretty amazing mental gymnastics to spin that as a good thing for Christianity!
