 I personally don't believe in stuff like that (the violent hauntings where people are choked or scratched) 

Because it's just like stories of alien abductions (while I do believe in aliens, I don't believe they come to earth and do experiments on people) it's all the same story, there's never any differentiation in the stories and those are the kind that are really easy to make up. 
  




 The reason most people aren't fans of ghost adventures (myself included) is that they use way too much religious talk. The way they talk, it's like they expect you to believe that God and demons and the devil are actually real, when there's no real proof that any of that stuff is. 

Granted, I did used to like Ghost adventures, but I like Ghost Hunters better, too bad they never show it anymore.  




 Tell that asshole to stop leaving his blood all over the place if he's going to be bunking with you. 


I have no advice. When I was younger, my friends and I would go to the local graveyard after dark and take pictures, we caught was looked like a ghost cat but that was about it (story of that in a nutshell is that there was a large orange tomcat that lived in the Graveyard, he lived there for about 10 years, then got hit (as there is a large, 4 lane highway right beside the Graveyard) people would see his ghost walking along the stones. The Grave caretakers actually buried him in his own grave next to a lady who would come and feed him, before she died. 

The picture we took we actually saw a pair of yellow glowing eyes hovering (about the height of a cats head when it's sitting) above that very same ladies head stone) but there was no actual cat in the picture.

He should take a decent camera with him and maybe a voice recorder and ask some questions. 


Also! Have this story, an old friend of mines grandparents house was haunted by two ghosts, one they called "Rob" and a female entity called "Emma"

Well, "Rob" liked to make a lot of noise, specifically around 12am-1am. So one night, I'm staying with my friend at her grandparents house and we were asleep in the living room when at about 12:30am we heard what sounded like something scratching along the walls. So my friend freaks out and goes to get her grandpa, who comes groggily shuffling out into the living room and goes "Robert! You better stop scarin' these young kids, 'er ye'll have to start paying rent!" (now her grandfather was a Texan, born and bred, so imagine that line in the thickest, Texan drawl you can imagine xD)

But! the noise stopped a few minutes afterward o-o.
