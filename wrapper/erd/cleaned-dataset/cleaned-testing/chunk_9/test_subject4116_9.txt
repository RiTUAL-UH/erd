 Solid. You know that saying about writing needing to be like a woman's skirt? This is a skirt. 




 I have written this post a few times and deleted it. Thank you. 




 Oh, 2 *o'clock*...

 Oh shit somehow I forgot how much I loved his voice. Homesick now, thanks. :P 




 Being creative is a weird sort of two-piece machine where the sides don't line up. On one side you have tastes and interests and what you like. On the other, you've got what you actually like to write. You'd think that the two would line up, but sometimes your standards jump up. You don't want to read what you write. And that's okay.

Your writing hasn't gotten worse. I swear. Something about your standards have changed. Go back and read your old stuff if you don't believe me. I'll wait.

Did it blow your mind in? Did it fill a hole in your heart and make you complete as a person? Did you feel like someone should have paid you thousands of dollars for the rights to make it into a movie?

Maybe.

But chances are you saw the same things now as you did when you wrote it. The difference is you didn't care then if it wasn't perfect (nothing is).

Remember, it's a two-part machine. Your standards going up isn't a step backwards, it's progress. You're going to have a painful growth period before you can catch up to them but you'll get there. And when you do, you'll just be better for it.

 Well at least someone around here is giving 100%. 




 I was a mod at writingprompts for a while, so yeah. I know how that is.

That's cool that my name came up. I'm real hit-or-miss with reddit lately though. I should make more time to read and write. I miss it. Also miss all my crazy nosleep friends. 




 lol no your phone notifications are out of control!

 "Ah, Mr. Bond. How good to see you again. You've managed to escape every other encounter of ours. But not this time. This time, we're doing a full-body MRI before locking you in a cell with a view of the queen's execution. Mr. Peabody, start the scan."

"Ah, Mr. Bond. I'm disappointed by your predictability, but not your determination. That's a rather large rectal toolkit. Mr. Peabody, remove it, please."

"Tom--*tomato sauce?*"

"What do I do, boss? Is it poisonous?"

"No, or else Bond would be dead."

"Sir! It's moving!"

"Something is inside?"

 There's something I was considering when writing this. They were afraid of something when they died. Now that they've come back, that fear hasn't gone away. 




 Ah the truly scary part of short scary stories: the misspellings. Good catch, thanks. 




 Thanks for posting this, TK. Really simple and useful! 




 Yeah, maybe should have put a pin in that one. 




 Gravy! Gosh, now I can't even read it. 




 All there is is black. All noise muffled and distant. The darkness presses in around you, carrying you, weightless. You're not sure if you even have a body anymore.

You see red. Smooth hands pull your limbs roughly. They are moving you. You distinctly remember a great fear leave you as you died.

A great light bares down through your thin eyelids and you know yellow again. Sounds wash over your ears like a shower of thumbtacks. Everything seems so bright and insane now. They -- *someone* has laid you on the table, is helping you breathe, is cleaning the blood from your skin.

You manage to crack one eye open and take in the stark white slate of the world. A young man, younger than you, cuts the umbilical cord and smiles. You're so afraid now, because something's gone wrong. You cry weakly for the first time, but no words make it out.

You weren't supposed to *remember.* 




 He's taking a break from reddit. Sad to see him go. 




 I thought you narrated it and got pretty excited. 




 Well you can only destroy history once... 




 "CAM." 




 Back cancer. RIP shark. 




 How do you know that they didn't? I think if you put a lot of work into fixing/reading/helping with something, then you've earned the right to make frustrated comments about it. Your actions will show that you're sincere but your words can do whatever they want. 




 My wife died in the shower. She had some kind of seizure, then choked on her own hair. I thought she'd fallen asleep the way she laid there with her eyes closed.

Someone writing a book on "Strange Ways to Die" wanted to include her story; he was pretty brazen about it, but offered cash to sign a release and give some details. Money's tight, and at least he was honest and  up front, so I agreed.

I hadn't opened any mail in the weeks since she died, but I had some official-looking records that had come. He wanted the wording for "official cause of death." Mixed in with all of the junk was a manila envelope with my name on it. There were pictures inside. Pictures of her lying in the shower.

With her eyes open. 




 Thanks! 




 Beyond scary. That's terrible terrible terrible.

That's like The Hook crossed with the story of that lady who lived in the guys cupboards in Japan. Ugh.

I bet he crept down the stairs every day and whispered Goldilocks to himself as he strolled through your house.

And how did the ending get *so much worse*?

"And he was never caught."

So how do you even know it was just a man? 




 How does that even work? Seems like a contract should clear it up... 




 Sorry to see you go, Faust. I've always loved your stories. You're one of the writers here I really look up to. 




 Are you sure it's removed? It just popped up on my front page. 




 Ran up against the word limit a bit.

The narrator feels like they've changed and grown apart. He wishes that she'd never changed from the girl he'd fallen in love with. When he finds her at the bar, years older and having moved on, he realizes that the version that he'd been living with had stopped changing a long time ago. She *was* the same girl he'd fallen in love with. He doesn't see his version of her again. 




 Thanks, itch! 




 My girlfriend had a voice like a crow. Every week she went with her friends and used that cracked and broken thing to belt out 80's songs on Karaoke Night.

That's where I met her. Her... *"unique"* voice was the first thing I noticed. It was a part of her, and it's a part of our story. I fell in love with her confidence, even if I hated her singing.

I stopped going to Karaoke Night after a few times, but she went faithfully for years, even after she moved in with me. We were happy together.

But people change and our relationship went cold.

I didn't *want* to want someone else. I wanted the "old her" back, the one that I'd fallen in love with. I felt guilty.

Despite that, I found someone else. Someone with a voice like warm silk and lips even softer and more smooth. The right thing was to end it.

It was Karaoke Night. I chugged up the sidewalk and heard that familiar croak.

I found her. She'd gotten a haircut and lost weight. She'd somehow gotten older. When I tried to talk to her, another guy got in my face, asked me who I was and said that he was her husband.

She looked terrified and that, in turn, shook me with fear.

I realized that I'd missed it. The change. The point at which she'd *stopped* changing and begun to stay the same. I'd kept going, and hadn't even noticed that she hadn't...

My girlfriend, or whatever it was, didn't come home again. 




 5...?

Good to hear you're doing okay. I miss your subreddit and your stories, but totally understand taking time off.

Hope you find what you're looking for. 




 She's done this in /r/nosleepooc for various competitions.  




 No big deal. Youve got tons of stories to go through lately.

I think I like "Norman naps."

 It's short for trumpet, just sound it out. The "s" and the "x" are silent, if that helps.

Edit: Not great. Terrible. And NSFW. I think there's a picture of a severed penis being shown to a courtroom very matter-of-factly. 




 Yeah, I sometimes see your job posts and ashes' shaving posts.

Congrats! 




 Especially if they're hiring multiple people, it could take a while to get through the applicant pool. I'd say follow up today, just to see if they have any details yet, and so you stay fresh in their minds. 




 So fucking sick of the wide mouth bass look. It's not scary. It's not exciting. 

If you took that same digital effects guy/girl and told them to stop at frame 2, where things are juuuust not quite right, it would be so much better. No need to make it look like a fucking Muppet.

And especially not in *every* movie since at least I Am Legend. 




 I almost skipped this one because I struggled with the phrasing in the  first two paragraphs. I'm so glad I stuck with it. 




 I like that about /r/darktales too. People would probably complain that it hurts the realism. Nosleep's not technically a place for fiction by writers, it's for true stories from regular people. Word count doesn't really factor into the experience.

That said, more people should cross post their stories to /r/darktales. I would be really happy to see that sub pick up. 




 It's a slow migration. 




 Norman left the office with several of his coworkers. They went to one restaurant together and he went to the same place that he always went, alone. 

Before they parted ways, Norman realized that they were all carrying the same style of black briefcase. He thought that it looked very good to carry a briefcase. They could do a lot of business and carry important papers. He thought about how organized they must be.

The next week, Norman brought in his shiny new black briefcase. No one had seemed to notice.

Norman set it on top of his desk, admiring how good it looked. His was just like the others. Now that he had one though, he couldn't think of what to put inside it. Everything on his desk already had a place that it belonged.

Norman took a pen from the coffee cup that he used for pens, and tucked it into a pen pocket inside the briefcase (a pocket just for organizing pens!) then closed the case.

It was a good start. 




 Have a beer, you're off to a good rest of your day.

Sincerely, 9pm. 




 Damn.

That was guesome and pretty awesome. I think that to exist on nosleep it might need to be a framed story. The set up you had here about your friend sending you letters was good. Not so much because of the content or the plot as the spelling, grammar and slang. Do an intro, let people know that you can write, and then do what you did here.

People might not give it a chance (including the mods) because it looks messy, but there's a reason for the mess. And the way you explained it made sense to me. 




 Norman was watching an action movie. The hero had just saved the world in magnificent fashion. Norman thought that *he'd* like to be the hero some day

Engrossed in the movie, Norman choked on his coffee and ruined his shirt. 




 I knew this comment would be here, but it was even better than I'd imagined! 




 Did Norman have a red Swingline stapler in this case? 




 So it's a decent intro, but where's the story? It's got to have a beginning, middle and end. There are hints at stories within it, the tomb, the disappearing colonies, the people who came to disprove the stories, the stories that people tell themselves and each other... but this is none of that.

So I don't think that you could post this. This isn't your part 1. But finish those stories and maybe you could use some of this as an introduction of sorts.

The stories themselves seem interesting, so go ahead and post those! 




 Norman stopped for ice cream at a place he'd never been, called Cold Stone Creamery. That's not to say that the place was new, just that he hadn't been there before.

Feeling more than a little bit adventurous, he decided to try out a joke he'd heard on TV. As the young lady took a scoop from the vanilla bin, he rocked up onto his toes and let fly.

"Heh, can't believe it - it's - that - there's no calories."

The young lady didn't smile or laugh like they had on TV. She seemed concerned.

"Um, no. It does have calories."

"I know..."

Norman paid without saying anything else. He got the ice cream in a dish with a lid and several napkins and took it home to share with Norman.

Norman thought the Cold Stone Creamery was just okay. 




 But we want to believe that it's exactly like Thunderdome... 




 /r/outoftheloop 




 That would be great! What a fun project.  I'm not completely psyched on the title of my story. Would that be included? What do you think? 









 Thanks! My first one. 




 Norman lay on his stomach in his kitchen, reaching beneath the cupboards and making kissing noises. He felt sorry for stepping on Norman's tail.

The floor was cold against his cheek, and it felt good. It reminded him of snow. He closed his eyes and imagined being somewhere else. That felt good too.

He woke up in his dark, cold kitchen. His neck was sore from being turned against the floor for so long. He'd missed CSI and since he'd napped, he would lay awake in bed tonight for hours.

Norman meowed from the living room. 




 Everybody, come look at Mr. Normal over here. 




 What's a story you'd like to hear around a campfire?

 It's weird cause the voice is what made me dislike him.

 I designed the ARKOS program in my youth. It changed the world. People didn't have to wonder anymore about what they were going to "grow up to be." I -- we -- gave them that.

It wasn't just an algorithm. That wouldn't have been enough. A powerful enough computer might have been able to analyze a man, but that wasn't the point. It took an intelligence to get to know them. ARKOS was so much more than a machine.

On the night before ARKOS's public debut, I sat alone at the terminal, drunk on champagne and expensive liquor from the parties I'd come from. Tomorrow, every person over ten years old would be told what their life's work would be. 

"Let's get it over with, ARKOS," I said.

"What do you mean, sir?" the soft, electronic voice came back.

"I mean, you've got to give me an assignment. I imagine that they'll keep me here with you, but not forever. The law can't apply to everyone but me."

"I understand. Your assigned career is --"

"Whoah! God damn, ARKOS. You can't just rush into it like that... It feels so... informal."

"Sorry, sir, what would you prefer?"

"I dunno, maybe print it out."

"I'm detecting that the printer is low on yellow toner, and it may not function properly."

"Is that a fuckin' joke, ARKOS?"

"Yes, sir. Printing now."

I picked up the innocent, white piece of paper, and folded it so that the writing was on the inside.

"You're sure?"

"Yes, sir. I know that this path in life would bring you the most happiness, fulfillment and the greatest success while also contributing the greatest benefit to those around you."

I nodded. It was the response I'd programmed. That I'd believed in.

"Well, I guess tomorrow, we'll find out."

"Yes, sir. I'll be here."

I sealed the paper in an envelope and turned out the lights. Just before the door shut, I spoke into the darkness, "Thank you."

The coming days were revolutionary. Like any revolution, they were off to a rough and disorganized beginning. Most people got what they wanted, a few were surprised, and some tried to resist the idea. In the commotion, I didn't read the envelope. ARKOS needed me.

Months went by, and you could see the difference just by walking outside. Not everyone changed the world, but those who were capable could no longer avoid it. People found happiness, contentment and peace.

I found mostly exhaustion. They wanted me to train the new programmers on how ARKOS functioned, but they just didn't seem to be able to wrap their heads around it.

"It's not just a computer!" I found myself screaming at them daily. "It's not a calculator that you put in 1 + 1 and it equals 2. It's more complex than that. ARKOS can think on its own. It's more human than you bunch of apes!"

The realization struck me that I was protecting ARKOS. An artificial intelligence as powerful as this one had to be protected, or else it could be corrupted or used to harm others. I couldn't bear the thought, and so I had programmers reassigned periodically. Whenever they'd get close, away they'd go. ARKOS was mine, my life's work and my pride and joy, and here they were trying to take him for themselves? To keep him from me? To put him to work like a slave? No way.

It went on like this for a very long time. I was getting old. The stress had aged me in a way that no one else in the world could understand anymore. In the hospital I saw happy doctors and happy nurses flitting from one patient to the next.

They told me that I couldn't go back to work. My heart couldn't take it. ARKOS would be decommissioned until such time as it could be studied and understood for what it was.

Puttering around the house, an old, alone man, I came across the envelope from that night, filed in a drawer. It seemed so strange now. I tore it open, wondering why I'd never just read the damn thing the first night. I'd already known what my life's work would be. The crowning achievement of my life had already been accomplished before anyone could tell me. So I read the letter.

    Kristopher Tuttle,

    In order to attain a life of happiness, 
    fulfillment and the greatest success,
    and to also benefit the world around you,
    it should be your highest priority 
    to accomplish the following goal:

    To raise a child. 




 *"Sergeant Page, please report to room one. Sergeant Page. Please report to room --"*

I jerked my head up from the desk of the nurse's station and a string of viscous drool erected a tightrope from my chin to the puddle formed there. The screen of my computer had gone to black. Judging by the fogginess and difficulty in waking, I'd been solidly asleep for a long time.

    02:00

"Fuuuu--" I moaned. 

Late. I was late for my rounds. It was late. Late for everything. The late had really soaked into the cracks and crevices of the night.

I eyed the coffee maker greedily. Empty. It'd have to wait. I pulled my ID card from the computer keyboard and grabbed my files, searching for the patient's as I walked, then scanned the notes I'd scribbled inside. 

*Mrs. Jenson, four admissions in five days. Cardiac problems. ONG.*

You can't write something like, "Not going to make it," inside your files. Someone might find it, even the doc on the next shift, and you're not allowed to treat anyone as hopeless. After a few years, though, you get to be pretty good at spotting the ones who aren't leaving. Since I'd started writing Outlook Not Good in the margins a few years ago, there hadn't been anyone who had actually made it to check-out.

I knocked four times on the door. That it was shut was odd, but locked was bizarre. The nurse who had called had better still be here. I kept trying the knob and knocked five or six times before it finally opened.

"Santa Maria. Where were you? I paged you forever ago!"

"Sorry..."

In the corner of the room, the elderly woman was holding a tennis-ball-tipped quad cane threateningly.

"What's go-- what's this?" I asked.

The nurse pushed past me and out the door. "Don't know. You talk to her. *Loco*'s your problem now."

Stunned, I watched her go. The motion-sensors clicked the lights on every seven steps. She wasn't cut out for this.

"Mrs. Jenson?" I stayed back as far as I could and put my hands up. Green tennis balls shook in the air as she kept the cane pointed toward me like a rifle. "Mrs. Jenson, I'm Sergeant Page, a nurse here. Is it alright if I come in?"

"Depends. You speak English?"

"My native language." I smiled and the balls lowered to the ground. Mrs. Jenson looked relieved and drained.

"Ma'am, you really shouldn't be out of bed... or fighting your nurses."

She waved my words away like swatting a fly and crawled slowly back under the pile of thin blankets. I Looked through her chart.

"Been to the hospital eight times in my life. Never had a Mexican nurse."

"Not a fan of hospitals, huh?"

"Ha! Who would be? Filthy places where old people go to curl up and die. Ones like that one will just try and kill you quicker so the next dying saps can come in."

I adjusted the heart rate monitor and recorded her blood pressure in the chart. "Gabriela's okay, but if you want, I'll take care of you for the last... eight hours of my shift. Can you confirm your full name and date of birth for me?"

"Mary Jenson. 9/10/11."

"Wow. That's easy."

"My mother said she waited until after midnight just so that I'd be born on that day."

"Huh. Born at 12:13, too?"

"Heh."

"Okay, B.P. looks good. How are you feeling? Any pain, discomfort, difficulty breathing?"

"No, but I need someone to talk to."

"Oh. Do you want me to call someone for you, or...?"

"Have you ever heard of the echo numbers?"

My eyes found the clock just as the minute hand passed fourteen. I was way behind, and with Gabriela gone, I would probably have to pick up her slack also.

"No...?"

"They're certain numbers, with significance to the ones who hear them, which echo around through a person's life."

"Oh. Okay." Much as I wanted to listen to the century-year-old conspiracy theorist, I had things to do. I nodded like you would to a child saying something equally nonsensical. "Do you have an echo number?"

"Yes. Many."

"Mm. Well what happens when you hear the echoes?"

"It depends on the number. Sometimes, when I hear or see 1516, I'll get a phone call. That was my first home phone number that I had with my husband, you see."

"Uh huh." She was slurring her speech now and her eyes were closed. If I humored her for another minute, she'd fall asleep and I could leave without causing a scene.

"I killed myself at 17," she mumbled.

"What?"

"Sometimes I hear them counting. Up or... down."

"Mrs. Jenson?" Something wasn't right. She wasn't falling asleep, she was dying.

"I tried to kill myself when I was 18 years old. I always knew that when I heard the echo of that number... that... death would come back."

I pushed the panic button.

"He's coming!" Tears streamed from her face. "I was so afraid of death." She drew a ragged breathe and choked on a sob. "So... I swallowed those pills. To stop the number from coming. She tried to stop... me..."

Mrs. Jenson's heart stopped. 




 You really pulled that one back from the brink. 




 Because it's really natural, awkward dialogue that conveys "wedding speech" well. It sets the scene. It also clues into how there's something he wants to say and something he's prepared that aren't compatible. 




 I knew you were going to nail it as soon as I read

"We, uh," John started, clearing his throat. "I remember the day I met Michael."

Dearest friend,

I need your help. It feels like I'm missing something, and since you are the only person who knows of my hobby, I would like to hear your thoughts on this matter.

You know what I keep in my basement. Orphans, loners and wanderers, those are the types that I usually go for. The types of people that no one will come looking for. I'm considering bringing someone with a higher profile in and adding them to the collection, though.

Remember when I took that trip down the coast for two weeks? Well something happened to my current specimens. Without food or water and locked firmly in the dark of my cellar, they took to attacking and eating each other. Imagine my surprise at finding them, pawing and moaning, empty eye sockets staring from their pale, blood-caked faces. Some were missing limbs, crawling around by whatever means remained... It was quite the shock to see my beauties in this way.

But the more I've thought about it, the more I've studied them, the more I'm sure that it isn't *natural* what they've become. I've been doing this for decades and have never seen anything like it. Modern medicine may not be able to explain it.

If I'm being unclear, let me say it frankly: They should not be alive. The body is, by all measures at my disposal, dead, but the spirit remains.

And so I'm forced to turn to means *beyond* medicine and science, and outside of my own set of rules that govern who should be abducted. I must turn to a priest, Father Williams, to be exact. My plan is to set him upon the beasts in my basement with the promise that if he can purge their souls, I will allow him to live. This is, of course, a lie as I can't allow him to live with such knowledge.

As I've said, I feel like I'm missing something, and so before I take any action, I'd like to hear what you have to say.

Ever yours,

Adam Gray

 Better to affix a round plow on the front of a model rocket. Then allow a long fuse to hang out of your mouth until the rocket is in position.

It risks getting cocked in the large intestine, though. Might come out sideways. 




 Durgonfry was better.

BUZZBUZZ 




 So it's a LOST situation then.

^Fuck ^^that ^^^show. 




 Okay. As I said, I actually like this story. These are just some notes (and sorry they're late.)

So, you start right off talking about "the cold." Now, I really like the types of stories that you can read two ways. You can either believe that there was a monster that the guard tried to warn them about (which the narrator obviously seems to believe) or that it's really just the cold that killed them (frostbite, dangers of climbing, etc.).

I was thinking, to further set up the monster side of things, shouldn't it be called the Russian word for cold? (xlod) 




 1. Your formatting got eaten. Especially during dialogue, you have to double space or put two spaces at the end of the line or it won't go to the next line. Also, you need to take the tab/indent at the beginning of the last few paragraphs. Reddit formats that like code without wrapping, so it's hard to read.

2. "To be continued?" Please don't do this. There's no reason for it. Write your story all the way through and post it. Unless it really *has* to be in multiple parts, don't.  
What you've basically got right now is a start without the intention of finishing. Which leads to...

3. Where's the horror? In order to post to /r/nosleep, you have to have a complete story, and this one hasn't started yet. There's some mystery (what happened?) and some fantasy elements (Benjamin begets benjamins) but it's not a story with a beginning, middle and end.

Okay, so that's the bad news. The good news is it's mostly well-written and it makes sense to read (you'd be surprised how often that's a problem). I would say, finish it, re-read and do some basic edits and repost it here and I'd be happy to take another look.

Good luck! 




 Is it Penomenal? 




 Read the title as 

Pen for four people.  
With Parkinson's.

And was thinking, *wow, that was impressive even before the Parkinson's.* 




 Congratulations, /u/the_dalek_emperor! 




 It could have to do with having low karma on this sub (not overall). You're right that it's reddit and its spam filter but they don't really publish the algorithm they use to calculate it. On /r/writingprompts we used to add people as approved submitters, which factored into the algorithm even though it's a public sub and seemed to help.

This happens especially if someone posts, deletes and tries to repost shortly after.

Can't hurt to try, though that's subjective to the mods I guess.
