 Then there's villians being killed off too soon like Scarecrow's dad and The Ogre, they should have been characters in the background causing mischief instead of being killed off so soon, they would have been great season villians in the shadows

Then there's The Flying Graysons, why only one episode and have their dispute resolved in one episode, they should have still had their dispute but come back in season 2 having resolved issues, then at least we would have believed it and it would be a great motif every season to have them return for a few episodes

Then there's Arkham, the whole Arkham promise has not been lived up to and should have been given far more attention, Gordon should have had a part time role in there for half the season then we would have gotten lots of little side stories featuring the odd villian we all know and would have been the great place to throw in Easter Eggs like colours / sounds / symbols / costume nods, it would have been a real treat for fans know this week they may get some little nods to the Batman universe 




 I would also say that whole Fish storyline on the island was pointless

She should have gone underground in the city then we would have had many useful episodes with her amassing her recruits and indeed luring Selena along, Ivy would have been included as well am sure or would have been on hand and picking up tips for her future self, maybe a young Harley would have been around as well

All this would have laid great groundwork for future younger villains but instead they put her on that god awful island which was a totally pointless plot device and detracted from everything else 




 I know they only planned for fewer episodes in season 1 so had to pad out the season which made for odd stories and was very hard to follow in places 

The show runners have said that they will arc the entire second season with multiple mini arcs, meaning we should have a far more coherent package  




 I'd disagree, the first season was hard to follow 

Season 2 will be a far more coherent package  




 Figured it may be a good idea to change the intro mood every season 

Like first few seasons it starts dark then gradually gets lighter over time 

Like the fonts and visual styles adapting to the season's main story arcs

Even the music themes could change from brooding Bruce to lighter Batman 




 Okey dokey ladies and gentlemen

What's in store for Riddle Man then?

From multiple personalities to what next

I'd love it if he went on a sadistic spree under the radar for an entire season

Be good to have him conflicting himself, like someone self imploding every second

Like self doubting his own motives, his every move, the truest form of insanity

This would be an epic descent in to the world he becomes but what of Ms Kringle

Maybe she will be the ultimate catalyst for his ascension to the dark side, she's such a cock blocker lol

If she carries on teasing and messing with his head, you'd not blame him for ultimately slaughtering her 




 Wow, looks like Selena will have her lethal little cat claws out soon lol 




 Well, season 3 has just ended and now a teaser for season 4

Are they shooting back to back seasons now with no breaks? 




 RIP Robert Stack, you are still missed and a class act till the very end

His voice alone gave us chills, he really brought reconstructions to life 




 When will this be available in the UK, will these be available at my local electronics store? 




 Oh god, does this mean she is busted or is this made up? 




 Yikes not much of Mulder but Scully is always very fine x
