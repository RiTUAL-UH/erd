 Wil Wheaton got pepper on his dick and dipped his junk in milk in his son's favorite mug. Apparently he gave his son that mug as a gift when he moved into a new house.  









 A guy on an empty elevator risks a fart. The fart ended up smelling much worse than he had predicted. In an act of desperation, he begins pulling out pine scented car fresheners to mask the scent. The elevator stops and a lady and a drunk guy get on. The drunk guy sniffs in disgust and says

"It smells like someone shit out a Christmas tree."
