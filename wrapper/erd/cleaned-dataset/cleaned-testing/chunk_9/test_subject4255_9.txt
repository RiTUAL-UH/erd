 Does anybody read the sidebar? 




 Yes, the bird flu going around is killing millions of chickens.  









 DAE HATE OBAMA??? 




 Obama sold the weapons? Like, he went down to Mexico and brokered the deal?

He also sold military equipment to police? 

Man, he is one busy man!

 Put Eric in an ant hill, he would want it that way, so selfless. 




 My SO and I split 5 weeks ago. The first two weeks were an absolute nightmare. The third week was much better and now I'm doing just fine.  

Same sort of situation too. 3 years together, she came from money, I didn't. She wanted to be engaged, I don't have the money. She just got her masters degree and is set to live with her parents for a year. We fought about stupid stuff all the time.  

As much as I hated to see her go, in the end it was for the best.   

I was able to finally do what I wanted: move out of Texas. Now I have a job lined up in DC that I will start at the beginning of next month.  

A great book that is helping me get through this is called "How to Survive the Loss of a Love" and I have a copy that I am more than willing to send to you.  

It can be a little preachy at times (I'm not sure if you are religious or not, if you aren't, just look past it) but overall it really puts things into perspective. It taught me to focus on me now.

 




 How old are you? 




 Hahahahaha, you've got to be kidding me.

Black people show deference everyday and are still belittled.  




 Do you want me to draw red lines? That barrel is pointed at people.  




 That gun is pointing at the people running off, can't you see? 




 [You need to rewatch it then because that barrel is pointed at people.](https://youtu.be/R46-XTqXkzE?t=3m11s)

Oh, and nobody is attempting to grab his weapon.  




  there's about 5 seconds total the officer has his firearm out and it is **never once pointed at a person**

You and I must've watched completely different videos.  




 Where did you hear that? 




 Sick reference bro 




 I wish Heavyweights was on Netflix still!

I'm going to have to go with Zoolander. 




 MINERALS LEL 




 Yeah, the hitler comparison is an actual logical fallacy called "reductio ad hitlerum"  




 No, a subject that people bend over backwards to confirm beliefs with other users. Kind of like Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul, etc. 

"Oh! You love guns? Me too! Let's touch penises." 




 Oh great, another 'I have no idea what a circlejerk is' comment.  




 Oh great, another gun rights circlejerk.  




 Right, and Bernie voted 'No' towards the USA Freedom Act. 




 I subscribed to Darknewt for a time and then once GTA V came out, he stopped doing Morrowind Let's Plays. 




 Just like the old days, right? 




 Yeah, he must be a total asshole. Break up with him now and know that once you are with /u/Pnhan89, you will never be spoken to when it's obvious you're on the phone. 

/s 




 It could be sooner!? 




 DECEMBER 31ST!? WHAT THE FUCK! 




 Look pal, I'm not going to look up everything for you but here you go:  

http://m.dailykos.com/story/2015/06/01/1389699/-BERNIE-COURIC-Interview-Bernie-is-voting-against-USA-FREEDOM-ACT

Sanders, who opposed the Patriot Act and its reauthorization, said he plans to **vote against** the less-wide-ranging USA Freedom Act, passed last month by the House, which would allow some counterterrorism tools  including the NSAs controversial bulk data collection  to remain in place.  

And just in case you don't know exactly what the USA Freedom Act really is:

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Freedom_Act  
 




 Booo 




 Bring your concerns to his/her attention. He/She might give you what you want. 




 Or maybe it would have and they thought the filibuster was unnecessary?  




 Nah. 




 Remember the first time Rand Paul filibustered and the top article on Reddit's front page was about it? Remember the first comment? Here's a refresher in case you don't:  

"And Bernie voted YES!"  

That was a load of horse shit. Bernie voted yes for cloture. That means he voted yes to having a vote. He did not vote yes on the bill itself.    

Whatever user made that comment is a smart cookie. He knew reddit never actually reads articles or confirms them with their own research. So what we got was everyone shouting "BERNIE SUPPORTS DOMESTIC SPYING?" when in reality they should've been shouting "BERNIE SUPPORTS THE ABILITY TO VOTE ON THIS BILL!?" which doesn't sound as circlejerky. 




 It wasn't that soon after. You're just appealing to reddit's dick. 




 Booooo 




 Back when the game was good. 




 Why would you put ice cream in your back pocket? Weren't your afraid it would melt and get your pants/shorts all icky?  




 I can't wait until this isn't a thing anymore. 




 It happened at college campuses too.  




 Oh, shit is bright! 




 $45 dollar flight from Dallas to DC? I'll take a little shit. 




 Why didn't they do this at night? 




 Baby, did you just fart because you blew me away. 




 The program will die with or without Rand's filibuster. He is just doing this for PR. Bernie knows it will die and wants to stop Rand's huge waste of time.

 




 His point is: "Rand is better"

I completely disagree.  




 I appreciate your appreciation. 




 Better enjoy it. Bird flu has taken 50 million chickens to heaven. 




 Where did you hear that? 




 Ah, it all made sense with the band at the end. Thank you for the explanation. 




 Ok, I know this is real. Like, no little play sets, but why do the people look like they are claymation? 




 I would love a resume spruce up. I will PM you. 




 The link is broken. You need to take the 'www.' out of it. 









 That is odd. I'm not sure why it's not working. I viewed it in incognito mode without any problems. 









 I didn't like the game but I am from the area that the first sequence happens in. It was cool to be able to recognize where they were in regards to me being in that location! 




 Deus Ex: Human Revolution

Not just a great opening, but a great plot and story. 




 "Edit: Front page! 

Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!" 




 I was a little shit in elementary school.   

In 5th grade my mother, sister, and I moved out to a rural area from an urban area because my parents separated.   

Coming from an urban school I had this shitty mentality that I was smarter than all of the rural kids. I wasn't very nice to my classmates or teacher. I was a really shitty kid.  

Anyhow, I had a terrible problem turning assignments in, so bad that my teacher did not allow me to participate in the honors program at my school. Naturally I was angered by her actions and over the next couple of days disrespected her constantly! She finally had the last straw, grabbed my arm and dragged me to the front office to retrieve my mother's contact information that was located in a rolodex on a form all students turned in at the beginning of the year.  

She's spinning and searching and finally located my form...

"OF COURSE!" she exclaimed "It's a blank piece of paper because you never turn anything in!"

I just smirked devilishly. 


She brought me back to the classroom and told me to call my mother from the classroom phone. I started to punch in a bunch of random numbers and professed that I didn't remember it (I was lying).

TL;DR: I was a little shit.  




 Holy shit, leave the innocent animals out of your crusade! If this was a member/members of FLDS, they are going to have a hard time getting into heaven with this on their resume.  




 Where did you hear that? 




 Once a cheater always a cheater!

Either she did this to you before and you forgave her OR this story is complete bullshit with a phrase reddit throws around that gets upvoted. 




 I think it's just the users from racist subreddits that jack each other off in default sub posts that involve race.  




 FANTASTIC!  




 So, I was able to test the part. It functioned accordingly. The problem went away for a bit but I decided to retest the error codes.  

It still said 14. Anyhow, I immediately started the engine in order to run the car for a bit (with the paper clip still in the connector) and the car jumped then completely shut down. Now the dash isn't getting any power, turning the key does nothing. No lights, no A/C, nothing.  

What did I do wrong? 




 You can download a pizza???? 




 Just ran the test and got a 14. [If this chart is correct](http://honda-tech.com/honda-accord-1990-2002-2/check-engine-light-codes-cel-diagnostic-trouble-codes-dtc-malfunction-indicator-light-mil-1490107/), it is indeed the IACV.   

14	P0505	ICS Malfunction  
14	P1508	IAC Valve Circuit Failure  
14	P1509	IAC Valve Circuit Failure  
14	P1519   	Idle Air Control Valve Circuit Failure  

What is the best way to test it, or rather, how do I test it with the method you mentioned? 




 Imagine the domino explosion effect that would take place if this was a GTA game. 




 Awesome! I lost my book awhile back, thanks for the link! 




 Thank you for your response!

That was one of the first things I did to it once the issue arose. I cleaned the IACV and put it back in and bought a new MAP sensor to put in. Maybe I should try a new IACV? 




 Could old fuel be causing this issue? When it finally gave out it was about 3/4th of the way full. Anyway to responsibly dispose of that gas so I can fill it with fresh gas?   

What's the best way (and cheapest) to look for leaks in the vacuum?   

I have checked around to make sure no wires have been chewed up: all clear.

I cleaned the throttle body like 3 years ago and I recently cleaned the IACV. MAybe I should get a new IACV? 




 Thanks! I do not know how to access the trouble codes, but I will google it.

I have cleaned the IACV (like in January) and the it's been about 3 years since the throttle body has been cleaned.  




 You can get MRSA from popping a pubic zit? 




 I heard it's another way he punishes his wife. 




 I could be wrong! Another user responded to me. 




 What about the actual question? Who would you vote for? 




 Hmm...  

It must have been the mod from Arma 3.  

I remember trying to download the client and it was taken down.  

You're taking about the Arma 2 mod, that one is still up? 




 Last I checked, DayZ mod doesn't exist anymore because of copyright issues that spawned from the standalone.

I tried playing a couple of weeks ago with no luck, or maybe that was a DayZ mod for Arma 3. I am having troubles recalling.  









 Yep, just rustling some jimmies.  




 You have a source on that stat? 




 Just like concealed/open carry holders! 




 I must've missed that!  




 Where'd you hear that!?  




 Baltimore ~~Protesters~~ Looters/Rioters Tried To Light This Pizza Shop Owner on Fire 




 A browser you could log into and it would save your bookmarks.

I submitted a business tip to Google back in 2010 about this idea. A year and a half later it was an option in Chrome. 

Would I have liked to be the catalyst in that? Yes.

Is it possible it was already in development before the time of my email? Yes.

I will never know. 

Google, if you are reading this, I am sorry my immature younger self reacted to this situation. In five years I have really grown and now I look back and think: 'how stupid/arrogant were you!'
 




 Dude, I am in the same situation! 

You wouldn't happen to be in higher education, would you?  




 Hands off my jerbs. Hahaha, jk. I hope we can both land a gig! 




 Do you know any good recruiters? 




 You're a server admin? That's awesome! How did you get there? Just volunteering? What was your first job? 




 Well, that department has a great retention rate, so I don't see any positions opening for the next 3 years. 

I do have a linkedin! I updated it last week. What else should I include on it? 




 How the heck do I convince a company that I am great with technology? 

I graduated with a BA in History but I've been working on computers since I was 9 years old. I am currently 25 and I am called upon in my office when someone's computer is malfunctioning. 99% of the time I fix it, and we HAVE AN **IT** DEPARTMENT!!!!

I've applied to numerous IT positions in the Dallas area and have created a great cover letter to supplment my application that goes over my qualification. I'm getting antsy though! I have on heard back from one employer who asked for an interview, when I told him the times I was available, he never got back to me! 

I have two months to find a position in the Dallas area or I am going to be homeless.  




 Rip non mobile users. Lol 




 He did!? I MUST'VE MISSED IT! 




 BOOO CAPTIONS 




 Where did you hear that? 









 So much passive aggression!

Staph sounds like Staff.

It's essentially 'Staff Only'

 Yeah! It's made of ducks.

 Nice to know that this information was posted in /r/games before this shitty meme subreddit.

 It's called an opinion.  




 We do. Dude is lame. 




 If you have to watch half of it for it to be good, then it isn't good. 




 Look, if the content takes a hit then the users will be okay with power users.   

It's the old kings conundrum. We try to 'rule' in favor of the majority. We have been having a lot of outcry about power users. We made a survey, we are listening to the voters, if they become unhappy with their decision, we can vote to change it back.

I just wanted to keep this democratic.  









 I knew a guy that was in the movies about racing cars. He died in a freak car accident.

 Thank you!!! I am glad that they are enjoyable!
