 I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'd rather have cakepops 




 Can we agree to call it something else then? It looks and tastes nothing like cheesecake  




 While we're at it can we shame all these "no-bake"  recipes? No bake cheesecake is just not cheesecake, it's just awful tasting laziness. If you want something that's like cheesecake, just fucking make a cheesecake. It's not that difficult. 

*edit* and of course on the same day I complain about it here, someone on my Facebook shared a link to a mom blog 

http://www.mybakingaddiction.com/no-bake-smores-cheesecake/ 




 I've always liked allrecipes. The comments on recipes are usually good thetr 




 That would have made the post a lot funnier though  




 I remember being 10 and wanting to go to that movie but by the time my parents let me go, the theater didn't have any of those cards. Most disappointing day of my childhood.  




 Aw hell I didn't see that, that would have saved me an hour and a half 




 I make a good crust but the thing about a good crust is the proofing time. Developing the gluten is what gives the pizza dough a great taste. So because of my laziness, I'd instead just pick up a couple of dough balls from a local pizza place. The dough balls were only $2.50 each. So I got the benefit of great pizza dough from a place where they had better control over proofing the dough rather than my haphazard methods 




 I'd withdraw every penny every day. What I'd have to show for it was a room with a growing pile of cash in it. After a week I'd buy a house with 100% cash and start a cash pile room in that house. Then after another week I'd buy another house, and so on 




 We had a tire tear apart on our trailer travelling on the interstate. I stayed with the trailer and my parents took off to the nearest town to get a replacement. MHP officer stopped to see what they could do to help while we were waiting on the side of the road. Helped us bend the wheel well back out as the tire strands wrapped around it and pulled it into the tire further  




 What extensions did you use for YouTube? I've never really liked YouTubes layout but I've never seen anything that really fixes what I don't like. For example, I'm not a huge fan of the fact that collections were a pop-up/hover over menu. I'd constantly move the mouse too far and then have to hover over the collection again. And in general the YouTube page design is cluttered and convoluted, I prefer having these lists 




 I'll try to get back to you on this, at one point I had this same problem but figured out how to get rid of the channels so I'll look around and see what I did. It may have been something I did with collections though so it may not work anymore  




 This took me a bit of time to do but there's a little trick that speeds the process up. First you want to go to feedly and create an account. Then go to the chrome Web Store and search for a feedly extension. This extension will add a button on the navigation/url bar that will appear whenever you're on a page you can subscribe to with Feedly. 

The best way to do this is to go to "manage subscriptions" and go through the list one by one. Click on the channel, then click the button on the nav bar, subscribe and add/create the appropriate folders, rinse and repeat. 

The only downside is that feedly will only keep 29 days worth of content unless you specifically save certain links I think. But I actually like this better because now it acts more like an email inbox which is what I always wished YouTube could be like. You can basically mark individual videos or channels as read and see only videos you haven't watched yet. No more coming back to a channel after a week to pick up on a series again only to find that your watched history has been cleared and you don't know what episode you were on. 

I hope this is helpful to anyone missing the collections. 




 This reminds me very much of the Pokemon drinking boardgame which has gotten me extremely fucked up a multitude of times 




 I thought /r/Games and /r/gaming had the same mods 




 Because reasons 




 I almost wish that was me. I didn't even know that there was a multiplayer mod for this game. I suppose virtual traffic jams could also be /r/mildlyinfuriating

 Why should webber only eat monster jerky?  




 In all my recent games so far I've survived almost exclusively on trapping rabbits and spiders and having a bird cage. I always camp near 4-6 rabbit holes. Even without filler that has been enough for my survival via meatballs. But if you're also close to a spider nest you can trap spiders too. I know you can easily fight them but kiting them far enough away at dusk so their friends don't join in takes longer than leading them into traps after stepping on the web.

If I have regular meat I'll use morsels, monster meat, and regular meat to make a meaty stew, otherwise, I cook the monster meat and feed it to my bird for eggs. Then I use my morsels and eggs to make bacon and eggs which gives 75 hunger and also gives you a good amount of sanity and health 




 Was the expansion out then? I only started playing a few months ago. If you have never played the expansion you're in for a treat. There is so much more content in it and even more ways to die 




 /r/cameramangore 




 These are the best kind of prank phone calls, where they're making the person on the other side laugh 




 Yeah subreddit of the day is hardly a prestigious award 




 I cam see why, that looks disgusting  




 All the otaku purists who have a vendetta against an American spin on a classic  Japanese food i guess 




 I never called the gobbler sushi. It's deep fried deliciousness. When I lived in Bozeman I usually ate sushi at watanabe  




 That won't work too well when they can pull up the pictures from the hundred cameras that take pictures of you at the last weigh station you drove through and it didn't coincide with your logbook 




 He respawns as regular chester  




 I'm so glad they built another one in billings. I still had a card with 9 punches on it from Bozeman and got my 10th here in billings. Still waiting for the perfect time to cash in on my free sandwich  




 Go to Daves sushi and get the gobbler. It's one thing I have had in Bozeman that I haven't even come close to experiencing elsewhere  




 I play the same way as you, with a controller on my couch. I haven't tried any friendly-fire mods yet, I usually just drop the eyebone a little ways away before I get into conflict. I don't know about the glommer though as I've never gotten him 




 None of the places listed in this thread  




 You can trust him, he's Dr. Bees 




 I tried adding channels to feedly but for some reason, I can't scroll down on anything. I use this computer from the couch so I have a logitech keyboard with a touchpad and the only real good way to navigate pages is with the arrow keys, which don't work on feedly. Is there another good alternative for rss feeds? 




 Googling it you can find their website where you can buy it from:
http://www.9fingersmustard.com/

The website doesn't say where else you can find it, though I'd recommend hitting up rosauers or even town and Country. They seem to have odds and ends you can find many places 

*edit* you could try Joes Parkway too  




 Yeah I know that but the way he worded that suggests that deerclops is harder to kill in subsequent winters  




 Physics teachers always have an advantage in the engagement department. My high school physics teacher was like this and my college professor was the same way. Physics has a lot of real life applications with concepts that can easily be shown in engaging demos. There isn't much engaging about showing off the real life applications of using integrals to find the surface area of a 3-dimensional curve 




 That's pretty much the same story with any brand you find in Walmart  




 What happens after the first winter then?  




 Meanwhile I just got destroyed by a deerclops at day 31 because I wasn't ready for it 




 pretty sure I've seen her in another music video but I can't recall which 




 I like how that last one is a ghost  




 Management for places like that bitch about you being there too long after closing and that you should be walking out the door at closing time 




 They got dropped by gawker because companies they shit on pay gawker for ad space  




 Not to mention how sexist it is toward women in the first place to make a blanket statement saying females are bad at negotiating their salaries  




 20 minutes fly time is the most impressive part to me. I have a small quad copter and it gets like 6 




 WHY AM I FINDING THIS OUT AT TWENTY-FUCKING-FIVE YEARS OLD!?  




 If you have Android, you can use the Dolphin browser to switch your user agent to desktop. I use chrome for most things but if there's an awful mobile website involved that refuses to let me use the desktop site, I use Dolphin  




 We had to supplement with formula because he wasn't getting enough and was under weight for a little while. Eventually he just didn't want to breastfeed and we had to go to gas relief formula because he had gas pretty bad. At 6 months we were able to switch him to regular formula and started getting Costco stuff. Now at 10 months he's constantly refusing to drink formula and it's a fight to get him to drink what he needs, it's been hell trying to get him to drink water too. I really hope he'll like milk more when he gets to a year 




 I don't know what I expected to see here 




 Deaddove.tif 




 Htc one m8 here, Google Play says my device is incompatible and manually downloading the App, my phone wouldn't let me install it 




 The only guys who seem to get them are the bison and a bear or two  




 That's actually a cool detail for a horror adventure map 




 You could always make a burnt popcorn ale 




 Either way, it's not the solution I want  




 Hmm, I always use L on my keyboard. Never changed keyboard settings.  




 I'm still waiting for a feature that allows me to set subtitles on a show by show basis instead of making a global default. I watch enough anime that it's a pain to turn them on for every episode but I watch enough regular TV that it would be a pain to turn off for every episode. I don't care how simple it is to press L and change it, the point of having as much automation as possible is to not have needless button presses  




 I90 eastbound in Montana about a half hour away from Billings?  




 Where do I sign up?  




 That's weird, up here in Montana you get a temporary paper that shows when it expires and you have to have a plate on. That being said, even though I am a lawful citizen and pay my car registration every year, I haven't put my updated stickers on since 2009, so I've been driving with out of date tags for almost 6 years and have never gotten pulled over for it 




 I might have to check that out someday. I've been wanting to get into DnD but I have no idea what I'm doing and also having a hard time dropping $120 for 3 separate books 




 Montana 




 A good alternative name to the Streamline in Bozeman 




 That's actually a really awesome idea 




 Where's KAB at? I've lived here forever and only ever known about Splash Page 




 As much as I've always loved the idea of a LAN. I'm far too lazy to ever move my desktop for anything but routine maintenance  




 As someone with Charter, I definitely agree there. I still like Cablevision better but Charter has doubled our base download speed twice since taking over just under two years ago. 




 One time we fit 80-90 people on a bus that only seats 23 




 Yeah it was an outside job, few hundred employees spread across the state. If we wanted it cold we would have to bring ice and use our own coolers because it would get used so fast there was no point to toss it in a fridge. Probably about an entire pallet every month for each location  




 Not in the kitchen industry but I once worked for a place that spent thousands of dollars per year to supply their workforce with free Powerade every summer 




 I can't get gifsound.com links to work ever, but that isn't limited to reddit is fun, those don't work on any browser I have 




 Is this cosplayer male or female?  




 That actually sounds really awesome. I'll have to do that on the next world with the wife 




 Having a kid that demands my attention for most of the time I'm home as well as a job where I'm up and out the door by 5am will do that. I pretty much don't have time for any game where there is a significant time investment  




 Don't Starve is what I've been playing 




 traffic is only great if you live west of main street. You get to avoid a good portion of the shitty traffic on your way home. The whole one way in and out thing blows. They keep making more roads but they all still pretty much converge in one area 




 I was about to do this but got killed by other spiders in another area :( 




 I haven't really played any. I played minecraft and was doing that when they started adding the BS survival stuff like hunger. It felt like it had no point to me because you could easily make a shit load of wheat farms with no effort and then you could just have a stack of bread that would last you a week. It just felt like a cheap half assed attempt at "difficulty" and all it did was waste an inventory spot when spelunking. I've been meaning to get into 7 days to die and project zomboid as I think those look great, but noting else was really appealing. I fell in love with don't starve the first time I saw someone play it on YouTube. The art direction is great as well 




 I'm so fucking bad at kiting :( I was just on day 30 and got killed. I was on nearly the most perfect world and had the best start ever. Got a bunch of meat right off the bat because I started near pigs and merms fighting. Found a pig village with king and spread out pig houses and spider dens. Then next to that was an awesome field of rabbit holes that has given me tons and tons of morsels, then a little further there was a massive beefalo herd. Just an awesome location and I got fucked because I got cocky with a tier 3 spider den 




 I try to post as often as I can to keep discussions going. I love this game. By far my favorite survival roguelike I've ever played.  




 I have a bunch of traps for rabbits in my world but some happen to be somewhat near a spider nest. I went to go collect one day and found monster meat in one and came to the conclusion that my traps were getting spiders. I set up a couple more closer to the next and sure enough, the next day they were filled with monster meat, spider glands, and silk. 

By this time, the nest was tier 3, I went to attack it because I needed more silk and ran through my traps, capturing all the spiders, and then went back and killed the nest without issue and replanted the egg. 

Does anyone else do this for spider nests? 




 I'd say shadow of mordor, though inquisition you'll get much more playtime out of 




 More or less, yeah. It comes down to controller for me. I liked the 360 controller more than ds3 so I almost always got 360 games. Currently I prefer ds4 to the xbox one controller.  




 What's eso? And for the Witcher I was probably going to get on PC 




 All I have on xbox one is master chief collection. I should note I have shadow of mordor, latest assassin Creed, destiny, and dragon age inquisition on the ps4 









 I'm not finding Android system Web view in my app manager

 It is apparent that it's fake but hilarious nonetheless  




 And as a trumpet player, I'm not sure how I feel about it 




 It was Microsoft Points that got transferred to dollars when they changed that system and it expires June 1st 




 I'm not sure if /r/trumpet would love this or hate it 




 He doesn't even have to accuse them. They've been pretty shameless to this fact  




 Verizon here, I have shit tons of icons too 




 Are you sure about that? Pixar has a new movie every single year  




 Make a ton of guac and freeze it 




 There's a Chinese knockoff ipod touch called the itouch 




 Yeah OP's title pissed me off. They are not only late to the game, but dead LAST. Even Garmin has smart watches 




 He has been my favorite YouTuber ever since his how to be an unarmed bad ass in skyrim video. I also like how he has changed it to be more relevant to what he was doing in that video 




 All laptops seem to fall apart too quickly. I built my second desktop after having a laptop for four years that I got during college. It has been four years since I built it and it is still doesn't feel aged at all, whereas when I built it, my laptop was practically falling apart  




 As long as they keep 3d animation out of it

 Was anyone else more pissed off about them having people walking in front of the camera, blocking the shot in just about every single angle and cut?  




 I actually like willow. I know torches are cheap but I like not having to make them. I also make frequent use of charcoal over wood for fires so I always have little patches of trees growing. Sanity is never an issue when you can go light a patch of trees on fire and stand in the middle of it. What I do hate though is that she can be immune to fire but not overheat, which doesn't make sense because I think the two should go hand in hand. I also hate the glitch of setting crock pots on fire if you're holding your lighter, which I think was fixed in the base game, but I use a modded willow with her regular abilities for DST playing with my wife 




 Lollipop issue?  




 It seems that for the most part there are the same mods as the base game, but are there different ones as well? What are your go-to mods to enhance your DST game? 

Also, is there a mod that allows shared map revealing? My wife and I try to explore different areas to find the best spot for camp, using the fact that there are two of us means we can explore twice as much land, but then we end up with differently revealed maps 




 I've just read a few things here, occasionally making threads. I use the food Guide app on Android, it has a crock pot simulator which is great. The crock book app I also use has a better interface for looking at the final product and you can sort between what heals the most, what gives sanity and what gives hunger.  




 How do you force a minion to attack the den?  




 How?  




 I'm not finding that option in don't starve together  




 Is there a way to play DST without RoG content? We haven't even been able to make it to second winter with the base game and we're not ready to move onto RoG 




 I'd actually really like to see this same thing on a cabin in the forest  




 I'm already associated with the top clan because I talk to you on palringo lol 




 I have this exact same issue 




 I'm not sure if this post is actually serious or not, but this seems like a really good idea for people running in the dark for visibility  




 I've been there. I've also mixed up two different callbacks for different places. I worked part time at a sandwich shop like two days a week and when someone called any sandwich back that required us to actually cook ground beef we would have to call back "gotcha ________!" I hated that  




 I can't wait to get home now!  




 Well I'm rock hard now. UI has been my biggest complaint since Windows 7 came out 




 It looks like the Native Instruments logo in that it doesn't look like it at all 




 Also Varien 




 What are the changes? Did they make the interface any better? Does it work with dual monitors?  




 I'd be a walking billboard for Google if they did that for me 




 Then hopefully a batman corporation will have kryptonite  




 The only reason it works is because the thing it's in is basically making it read as a USB drive 




 Fuck man you nailed it right here 




 I like that last line, I'll try that sometime  




 I refuse to cool for my parents in their kitchen because of this.  




 One time my mother mentioned something was bland that I had cooked. Bitch your taste buds are broken, you'd faint if you knew how much garlic was used 




 I have another one. Fucking lists for EVERYTHING. Just normal every day things, I have a tasks app on my phone with a bunch of different lists on it. Things to remember, things I need to do, errands I need to run on x day, reminders for dumb shit 




 Did you exit the app during a raid?  




 I think those sheets would have been in the bin for me 




 Verizon M8 on kitkat, not experiencing this 




 You should probably lay off the meth then  




 Real sheet pans are the best. That's all I use in my oven unless it's like a pie or cake or something. Obviously I don't have a mega oven so it's just half sheet pans. 

[also I only use these Vollrathscoops] ( http://www.webstaurantstore.com/images/products/main/3789/298787/vollrath-jacobs-pride-47143-16-dark-blue-disher-2-oz.jpg). Screw any other regular scoop 




 Fuck yeah Montana  




 My wife is awful at washing dishes. I feel like I need to do everything in the kitchen but with my current job and having a kid I really don't have time for anything on the weekdays
