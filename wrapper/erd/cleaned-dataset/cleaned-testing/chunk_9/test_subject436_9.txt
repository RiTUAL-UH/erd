 People have been burned by Obama enough to not give Paul the benefit of the doubt. Remember how Gitmo was supposed to be closed on day 1? How long do you think it will take for President Paul to end the NSA spying programs if this bill passes? 




 I would argue the opposite about Dany and Cersei. It's been shown time and time again (at least in the shows) that she is way too naive and idealistic to know how to actually rule over people, yet alone take care of her dragons. "I'll free the slaves and everything will fall into place!" Perhaps it's also Emilia Clarke's terrible acting chops, but she is also portrayed in the television series as a petulant and stubborn teenager who constantly has to admit that her inner circle was right all along.

In Cersei's case, her thirst for power and control leads her to do batshit insane things that blow up in her face in the books. All because is an alcoholic who is paranoid about losing the only thing that gives her agency in the world: being able to manipulate and control her children.

In Sansa's case, why would you expect her to become stronger? She has not shown much indication of being particularly bright (unlike Arya).

One message that I think the show is trying to get across is that there are power structures that are out of everyone's control, no matter how hard they try to get out. 




 I don't understand why either -- Sansa was always depicted as a pathetic character since the beginning of the series. She is naive, selfish, not very bright, and at the mercy of everyone of around her. For four seasons she looked like she was going to burst into tears at any moment. Why would it make any sense for her of all people to successfully and suddenly gain control of her life? 




 So you think it's realistic for a teenage girl to pull some Littlefinger bullshit on a psychopath? That over the course of half a season she suddenly develops magical manipulative powers despite being horribly naive and selfish for the rest of the show? 




 I think the whole point that characters like Sansa, no matter how hard they try (twice in this episode!) to show agency, they are ultimately pawns of abusive men? Personally to me it is ridiculous to imagine that Sansa is even capable of seducing Ramsay or to escape with her own wit given the fact that for 95% of the series she was a naive teenager eager to marry Joffrey.

A lot of people have confused ASOIAF's supposedly feminist leanings to mean that women are empowered in the story. Quite the opposite: the point is to show how virtually all of the women in the series (and of the world, as a broader social commentary) are brutalized and manipulated by men, and this is supposed to bring a accordingly visceral reaction in the viewer.

I like to compare this show to how the plot develops in The Wire: no matter how hard people try, people are trapped in the institutions that they were born or raised in. They are victims of power structures, and things always stay the same. 




 The problem is that professors expect capabilities of undergrads that are today found in grad students. Undergrad thermo isn't for deep comprehension but rather for basic understanding and proving you can compute numbers and algebra. 




 I can't help but point out that the article is terribly skewed. The vast majority of taxi drivers in big cities don't own their own medallions, but rent them out from medallion holders (or in this case, holding companies which possess tons of medallions -- technically illegal but they get around it). 

In my recent travels I made an effort to talk to some Uber drivers about their experiences with taxi companies. To rent a medallion, you have to pay an advance. Drivers in Boston told me it was $500 a week, drivers in NYC said $135-$175 *per day*. This is before you pick up even a single ride.

Sure, Uber can be an asshole company, but drivers are paid flexibly. In the cities that I've used it, they even get paid while en route to the pickup and are paid nominally for a cancellation. Uber gets a cut of the driver's revenue, but it's in direct proportion to the amount that they drive.

The entire taxi medallion industry exploits the shit out of the driver labor force. What Uber is doing is allowing a huge labor pool that wants to participate in the industry to do so. Sure, Uber may change their payment schemes and will probably go evil, but they unleashed a new business model that won't be going away. 




 Why should the government help someone out on an investment that didn't pan out 20-30 years into the future? 




 I wouldn't say the series is not predictable. It definitely is -- you just have to have a pessimistic outlook on how the plot will develop. 




 To take it a step further, there are literally more East Asians and South Asians in the world that come from underprivileged backgrounds than there are white Americans. It should be illegal to have a drop down menu for your ethnicity in your application for college, and instead that information as well as your socioeconomic status should come from your personal statement. 




 Your teacher is wrong -- young people these days are reading more than ever, especially from mobile devices. The difference is that they are reading short form. 




 The point is that it's all upfront costs for cheap energy over the cost of its lifetime. No company (or government) is willing to put up with that kind of burden. 




 I'd say there were two proximal causes: one is Maliki, the other being the Arab Spring spreading to Syria. All of a sudden you have a bunch of secular dictatorships being thrown into disorder, and while the US put in some limited intervention into Libya, they stupidly did not engage Syria as much as they could diplomatically or militarily. 




 Shit, I still remember the days of finding bootleg FLAC audio from shows. 




 I mean, in the books she is a child/teenager. I'd think that most child rulers would act the way she is depicted on TV, especially since they don't have the maturity or emotional subtlety of a seasoned politician. 




 My favorite is to hold my hand out, palm up, and rubbing my index, middle, and thumb together like the "money" gesture. Every cat seems to think it's food and will come to your hand. 




 I had really complicated cystic acne up until I was about 27, and then had flareups now and then. Big ones, like up to an inch in diameter and half an inch high. Accutane was the only thing that got rid of it. After growing up with it, I make a conscious effort to never judge anyone for acne issues. To me, it's so condescending to even think that people who have acne problems are *not* trying to take care of it. 




 When he says it's his last time, he means until they pay him enough money for a sequel. 




 I agree that he did a lot, but the consensus is that civil liberties and how it relates to national security is a big issue that wasn't substantially debated in the past 8 years. I'm glad that the Republicans will have a throw down on this because it forces Clinton to take a stand. It's pretty clear that while Obama did a lot domestically that would be considered progressive, he is about the same as bush when it came to clandestine or CIA/NSA policies. 




 I live in Palo Alto. Wouldn't say people are extremely trusting, but definitely nicer than most parts. 




 I've heard that it's not uncommon for some women to be sexually aggressive after recalling sexual abuse. Apparently it's a mechanism for them to regain some sort of agency over their own bodies? 




 Here's the ultimate conspiracy theory: police aren't into "crime prevention" tactics and more into punishment because it ultimately keeps crime rates up and allows them to keep their jobs. When you depress the local economy by indiscriminately arresting and taking away people's licenses, you end up pushing people through the cracks of society (eg. they lose their jobs because they can't drive to work, fining the shit out of them for police revenues, etc). Consequently you end up with a higher crime rate in which now police are "indispensable". 




 Pharmacogenomics -- aka correlating drug effects and interactions with genomic variants -- is still a really young field. There are certainly a few interesting hits.

The biggest "personalized" medicine application that would come from exome or WGS data is in the context of cancer treatments. There are a lot of molecular subtypes and actionable genes which determine the specific targeted therapy to be used. 




 I work in the personalized medicine and genomics field. It's a provocative headline, but practically what it means is better clustering of patients for trials. We already do this today but the cohorts and selection of patients is really crude and isn't based on much molecular information. In fact, I bet if we had exome or whole genome data for every single trial that had failed in the past we could probably cluster them in such a way that those drugs could be approved but under special indications. 




 The party leader, if prime minister, has strong power over the legislative branch. Even if he or she gets pushed out by the party, it is only after they finish out their term. So you'd get four or five years of a dangerously unqualified candidate. And this is speaking as an extremely left wing Canadian. 




 It's not just black people. There's a also a very distinct Asian American/Canadian "accent". 




 No, he was 99% sure that you like him. It's just that when you invite him to your room to drink, on the 1% chance that he's incorrect it would turn into a Really Bad Situation. That, and he probably respects you enough to not take advantage of you as the first time you hook up. 




 Seriously, guys just blank out most of the time. I remember clearly in my sophomore year of college this one girl I was seriously crushing on knocking on my door when I was taking a nap and then asking me out. In my sleepy daze I said "Ummmm, can I think about it?". It was so awkward that she ended up cancelling/un-asking me with some excuse about being busy. 




 Upvoting you because I'm sure you'll get a downvote brigade pretty soon because of your comments on marijuana. I think it's insane that people think drugs that mess with your perception of reality have little side effects. Personally I don't smoke it anymore, drink socially, and even my caffeine intake is a lot less than it used to. A lot of people have problems with self-control and "dosage" control, so what ends up happening is that these chemicals will really ruin your emotional and mental well-being. 




 A psychologist (not mine, but one I know) once told me that one of the first questions she asks someone when they report having anxiety is about how much coffee they drink on a regular basis. Apparently caffeine intoxication is very common and is often misdiagnosed as generalized anxiety disorder. 




 I would eat raw whole mushrooms. Is that weird? 




 The difference is that there are a ton of other heavyweights in the field that can or do practice EEE. Apple and Google routinely pull this shit. 




 Not just that, but a big fuck you to everyone else. "Why should the public get free toilet paper?" 




 Don't do that, unless you want to get an opportunistic skin infection.

Maybe a better idea: somehow get a of sweat from someone who doesn't smell that bad (eg. give them a towel after they exercise), and squeeze it under your armpits. 




 I don't understand the current protesting strategy. It's idealistic and not pragmatic at all. If you want to affect change, you need to (1) separate yourselves effectively from violent protestors, and (2) have longevity in your movement. To achieve these aims it is way more productive to just disband as soon as the rioting shitheads come along so the police can round them up. Then you come back the next day, 7am. Rinse and repeat. You build upon daily momentum rather than sticking it out as long as possible every night and have it burn up (figuratively) quickly like a candle. The most successful movements have come about with persistence, not intensity. 




 I agree. Lining up in front of the police is saying "think about what looting and arson does for your community". Then again, I doubt the message of going to protest peacefully with the other 10k+ citizens will resonate with the rioters, considering that many of them are reportedly not even from the Baltimore area and couldn't give two shits about community. 




 Ding ding ding! These guys are probably anti-violence, not pro-police. You'd probably be hard pressed to find people being overly supportive of the police, but lining in front of them will deter violence and prevent the situation from escalating. They don't want their city to turn into a warzone. 




 I was at the AACR conference this past week and people are really excited about this type of treatment, called immune checkpoint blockade therapy. We are on the cusp of seeing a broadly applicable drug that can be teamed up with all kinds of targeted therapies. There was a trial presented at ASCO last year with pretty incredible results too.

What we now know is this: the immune system can modulate the tumor in good and bad ways. We finally have several drugs that are really potent in getting positive outcomes. 




 Not just them, but also for a great deal of people in a "professional" job that requires a degree. These people get paid a shit-ton of money, and it's reflected in the demands of their job.

The ads aren't for the average 9-5 person, and it's ridiculous of WaPo to think that it was directed at the average consumer. 




 On the other hand, I think it is great because it decouples medical testing for routine things from primary care, which means that the system will be less burdened. If I need yearly physical blood work, why should I waste my doctor's time? If I am a hypochondriac, a lab test is the first line of defense against showing up to the doctor and most tests would come up negative. For tests that come up really weird, follow up exams would obviously be ordered by the physician.

The problem is that the process of getting a diagnostic  is really ineffIcient. This helps relieve a bit of that. 




 It's not just about integration. While there is a stereotype of what it means to be "American", it is actually a very diverse set of identities that change over time. The whole point of being an American is the culture of enduring change. 

People talk about a "melting pot" or a "mosaic", but the reality is that North America has had the best record of dealing with immigrants in the entire world. The reason is because for whatever reason, in this continent our identities are not fixed in time. When you go to Europe, or to Asia, there is a strong sense of what it means to be "German", or "French", or "Korean", or "Japanese". It is an identity that is imposed on you and you are rejected from society if you deviate from it. In North America, you are free to set your own identity and that is why immigrants do so well. They can participate as little or as much as they want. Turns out, people like it a lot better when you're not trying to force cultural values down their throats. 




 Two or three other labs filed patents at around the same period of time. If not Zhang then other labs would be in it for the money. Sometimes the patent is there to put a stick in the ground, and as you said his lab has been very generous in providing reagents and knockout vectors. 




 This is very American. In Scandinavia and other countries Police aren't trained to shoot to kill. 




 Seriously, speaking as a very left-leaning person, liberals have no idea how to be a goddamn ally for anything. Many, especially those on the internet, have it ingrained in their head that there is only one true way for social justice and fuck the rest who are different. The left has no shortage of cynical, self-righteous, dogmatic, and segregationist asshats. She is doing something well-intentioned and low-risk to raise a little bit of awareness about poverty -- good for her for doing something, and shame on those who trash her online. 




 Legalizing and regulating prostitution is a nice first step but it won't stop human trafficking and it definitely won't stop rape. Whenever there are services to be provided, there will always be a way to exploit labor.  




 Have a PhD in a hard science at an Ivy League and went to a pretty competitive undergraduate program at a public school, so I feel somewhat qualified to comment. My grades weren't straight A+s, but they were pretty decent.

- Do your best to go to class and pay attention. Even if the professor is the worst in the world, at the very least you are copying down notes and have some passive absorption. And would you seriously be studying if you had skipped class?

- Do your problem sets/homework/reading. Even though they are worth a miniscule amount of your grade, keeping up with the course work is an amazing way to prepare for exams. You shouldn't be learning anything new when it's time to hit the books for midterms and finals. Instead they should just be review sessions that go over everything you had learned. That said, practice your problem sets and homework until you can do them without thinking. This applies to basically every single "hard" science course that I can think of. It's especially satisfying when you see a problem on the page during an exam and you don't even hesitate on how to proceed.

- Find a non-distracting environment for you to study. You could do it around friends, at the library, or in a study carrel. But you have to be honest with yourself about how much work you're getting done. If you're falling behind, it's time to find a new place.

- People who get good grades generally have remarkable self-control about when it is time to let loose and when it is time to put the nose to the grindstone. There is an appropriate time and place to party and relax, but part of growing up is knowing when to decline offers to party and get some shit done. There will always be parties later, and IMO they are definitely better after college.

- Looking back at my undergraduate courses, most of them are designed in such a way that it is very hard to outright fail. Even ones like Organic Chemistry and Quantum Mechanics have defined but distinct paths to success. When you are stressed, keep in mind that millions of people have passed these same courses. Most of these courses cover basic and fundamental concepts (even the upper-level ones!) so they are not impossible. They only require effort and hard work. 




 I think the author has a fundamental misunderstanding of what a promoter is, versus something like a transcription factor. Certainly genes induced using artificial TFs could have off-target/non-specific effects or gene expression changes as a result of overexpression. And there are off-target effects from gene silencing which is featured in some GMOs. But in both cases you are not creating "neo-proteins" that would be harmful when compared to the WT strain.

Even if you create completely artificial genes that are never seen in nature, the bar to accidentally create something actually harmful is very low as compared to chemical exposure in the agricultural food chain. 




 The coating must be the secret sauce as phosphorothioate oligos have been used for antusense drugs for a long time. I wonder if this could be used for colon cancer? 




 Catering companies have all sorts of tiers. Bon Appetit caters to multiple Universities here as well as a pretty large private company cafeteria. They all serve food of differing quality depending on how rich the institution is. 




 I think working in a lab pre-grad school full time should be a definite requirement for new PhD students. Unlike you, most people don't know whether they are cut out for that kind of marathon lifestyle. The fact that you published 4 papers in that 5 year period means you practically have a PhD already, or at the very least you are just as qualified as one. You'll know what needs to be done to get things published! 




 It doesn't make sense to wait for a processor bump. Literally nobody outside of the tech industry cares about it. What matters are the "peripheral" features, such as a pen, form factor, etc. The 5th gen Core series is more than functional enough.

The big problem though is how to sell this as an improvement over the SP3. It makes sense to push out the SP4 alongside the Windows 10 release as a flagship but they have to make it really compelling. IMO it makes sense to release two different versions of the SP4 -- one that works more like a PC, and one that works more like a tablet. Kind of like differentiating between the iPhone 6 and the 6+. 




 What about Steve Carrell in Foxcatcher? I mean holy shit. 




 To be honest, receiving a number from someone who is clearly interested is a nice problem to have. It's literally not even on the same stress level as asking for someone's number and getting it.

It really depends on the two people though and what they are comfortable with. I know plenty of people who are very traditional and wouldn't like it if a guy gave his number instead -- it's as if he doesn't want to put in the effort. And there are plenty of people who would like it. 




 Didn't Visa and MC announce a tokenization roadmap? http://www.wsj.com/articles/visa-mastercard-to-roll-out-new-cybersecurity-features-1423834542 As it starts to pick up pace and tokenization becomes default, chip and pin or any other "hardware" method will become obsolete. 




 This doesn't make any sense. If a hen can lay an egg for even two years it's a no brainer. They live in literally concentration camp style conditions, so it makes perfect sense to completely remove one of the primary safety risks that would get a mega-farm in trouble with the FDA/USDA. 




 Why isn't vaccination standard? Are egg-laying hens too short-lived to make it worthwhile? 




 The article is confusing. Was she a grad student or a med student?

I think people who attend very prestigious schools have to really worry about their mental health. There is so much pressure to succeed and be #1. Most are focused on THAT ONE GOAL that they are blind to new perspectives and new experiences. That eventually leads to anguish and for a lot of people some kind of mental breakdown. I'm not saying it doesn't happen to people outside of elite institutions but in my experience in all kinds of institutions I feel that people at other Universities tend to be more open-minded about opportunities that are out there. 




 I think BR is steadily being marketed towards their business professional line in multiple price brackets. Gap is just going to become casual. 




 Gap can make some pretty decent tees in decent quality. They could seriously enroach on American Apparel's territory if they just had a basic tee line that was half the price. Basic casual button ups are really hard though. Charging $35-40 for a crummy one and then $50-70 for their nice one is absolutely insane when you're supposed to be priced lower than BR and J Crew. 




 Uniqlo is a hit and miss. Their jeans are pretty nice, but I've had their tshirts fall apart on me easily. Dress shirts are 50-50. 




 Israel and Egypt have a warming relationship in the past few years. I'd imagine that if the US completely pulls out then a strategic alliance will be signed immediately. You would also see defense pacts with smaller western-leaning Arab countries. It's also not out of the imagination for Saudi Arabia to ally with Israel against Iran. You wouldn't ever get a full blown war in the region but you would see a lot of alliances emerge. 




 Similar parallels to Judaism, I guess. The analogy works quite well. Sunnis and Shiites' borders transcend countries, so they're perfectly happy slaughtering each other over stupid shit and have no incentive to participate in civil society. Kurds have a lot to lose. 




 Actually the road to multiparty elections is easier than you think. New parties just have to stop focusing on running for President and instead run for Senate and House races. Regional support is actually quite robust considering that they would be running on local issues (think the Northeast with its independents, and the Tea Party). You could get a reasonably large number of non-D/R representatives in the legislature if people weren't so obsessed over the short game. Once you have a stronghold of regional support, you then spread it to other states and then take it to the executive branch. Strong local support would also mean that it would later translate into strong representation in the Electoral College, meaning that these regional parties would become Kingmakers. It would take decades, but obviously American politicians don't think that far ahead.

Imagine if Florida was dominated by a regional independent party, or similarly with other Purple states. They would have the insider anti-Washington advantage every election and it would be impossible to get rid of them. Everyone would be clamoring for their support. 




 No kidding. Global foundries' fab capability is far being Samsung. Imagine now having the scale and mobile chip prowess of Samsung and pushing that into x86. It could really give Intel a run for its money.  




 Yes but as CEO you have a lot of power in dictating how to get growth and make money. Lots of tech companies structure their stock system deliberately such that stupid shareholder shit doesn't happen. You have less power to sue and demand change if your stock class doesn't give you significant voting rights. 




 I think they're looking at this through the wrong lens. Supporting Android apps is only a bandaid solution unless they can actually get developers to start switching. Apps are the "added value" of a smartphone. They are modular and fit a user's needs. Besides the dialer, maps, browser, and launcher screens, 99% of a user's time on a phone is in an app. What's the point of using a WP phone if those are Android-emulated apps? Is the industrial design compelling enough?

Rather, I think MS needs to put in heavy R D resources to make an app converter for existing Android and iOS apps. Automatic or semi-automatic code generation algorithms have been around for a long time. Even UI can be automatically converted -- most iOS apps follow a standard theme so this should be doable. It will still require manual optimization, but if you can reduce the barrier by at least 10x then you will bring a lot of developers into the fold. 




 As a scientist, it boggles my mind that this kind of thing can slip through. Do the editors not vet the identities of the peer reviewers? Or even check their email addresses? I would understand if there was a conspiratorial peer review ring between scholars, but this is a case of outright fake reviews with fake names. 




 Black market stimulants would be my guess. Pilots are known for massive sleep deprivation and exhaustion. 




 My guess is unlabelled pills for sleep deprivation since he's a pilot of a budget airline. Unregulated amphetamine derivatives. 




 On the same topic: neonicotinoids are insanely specific for insects. So much that it's hypothesized that they have a dangerously lethal effect to many commensal insects such as bees as collateral damage. The reason they were developed was because the use of organophosphate pesticides is a really potent neurotoxin to people and animals, and is famously harder to work with and dispose. 




 The real problem is that we arbitrarily decided to side with KSA. I guess at the time they had a lot more oil compared to Iran, but worldwide production of oil has changed the dynamics. Even if you look at the theological shitshow in the Middle East, the Saudis definitely take the cake in being the most brutal. There is a large diaspora of well-educated and liberal Iranians even before their revolution -- it's amazing that the US didn't realize and take advantage of this. If it weren't for the Shah we could have had a thriving democracy in Iran. If we softened our relationship with them today they just might elect some moderate leaders in the next few decades. 




 Another redditor posted somewhere that getting high from heroin is like a very warm pleasant hug. Doesn't sound like anything special, but it makes you happy. The problem is that the withdrawal is completely disproportionate to the high. 




 I went to college in Vancouver. The problem with safe injection sites is that while they're a nice idea, it's really only a drop in the bucket if you really want people to be safe. There are a huge amount of heroin addicts who have fallen so far down the cracks and are literally outside of the system that they wouldn't even show up at a safe injection site. There are so many addicts who also don't want to participate in society -- what makes you think they want to show up at a government facility? I guess I'm way too cynical, but I think the safe injection sites are just a cheap way to get political points while ignoring the structural and socioeconomic problems of addiction. 




 Top.... 100.

Seriously, you should never say "X is a top school" in any subject unless it is literally in the top. Places like Harvard, Yale, Stanford. It makes you look like you're compensating. 




 What the fuck, if you add $50k a year to even a minimum wage job that her husband could theoretically take, that is still way above the poverty line for Portland. It's not that expensive to live there. 




 According to another post here, residency matches are 90% and most eventually get placed in a subsequent attempt. You are not entitled to a residency position after medical school? It is a profession dealing with people's lives, so why is there so much controversy about leaving the bottom percent out especially when there are multiple programs for assistance? 




  Dont we take care of our own? Not really, not unless you come from money. In poor families you become a nurse if you want to aspire to a better life.
 Now she's just ranting.

Sounds like entitlement to me, and also sounds like someone who uses her "socio-economic status" to justify her entitlement. You can be financially poor, but if you are at OHSU of all places for medical school then you sure as shit aren't in the same galaxy when it comes to hierarchy in society.
 




 Sometimes I wonder if she is for real. Medical graduates start out as hypochondriacs in their first year, but are trained to not fall down the rabbit hole of self-diagnosis. 




 90% match resulting in a few hundred people falling through the cracks is still an incredible statistic. How many PhDs end up with a successful postdoc or even a faculty position? As long as there are resources to help them improve the next time around (eg. prelims, etc.) then I'm not exactly sympathetic to the bottom percent of those who don't match. These people are well educated and can do many other things besides medicine. They aren't the bottom 1% of society with little to no social mobility. I'd save my tears for others. 




 Here's the problem -- she's certainly entitled to your right to have a child, but apparently she wants to have her cake and eat it too. It is really difficult to be a resident, let alone in gen surg, when you are dealing with a newborn. She could have easily placed into another residency program that has more comfortable hours. She's also shockingly unaware of people moving between residency programs. This sounds like a person who did not choose to explore all the options available to her, and didn't want to take a pragmatic approach to her career. She could have been in a surgery program -- it would just be a few more years down the road with another program in between. But instead she blames the system and writes an angry blog post? 




 That's what bothers me a lot. People who bet the house and gamble on a slim chance, and then blame the system when it doesn't work. You never go all in -- you need to have a contingency plan. Didn't she learn about that when she applied to medical school in the first place? Didn't she apply to any safety schools? Her first mistake was not having a backup in IM or Family Medicine. Lots of people transfer to different residencies, but you need the first foot in the door post-med school. 




 You know, I'm normally in support of this but if she's knowingly pregnant then I can't be sympathetic. Residencies, especially general surgery ones, have an extremely limited number of spots. They are one of the first lines of defenses in hospitals. It's not like any other job where you can suddenly grab another MD grad out of thin air and have him or her take her spot temporarily. You could argue that you would just have an extra resident once she comes back from maternity leave, but how would you balance out the ongoing training and workload amongst residents? Rules against pregnancy discrimination is very important, but there has to be exceptions in the health care industry where other people's lives are on the line. 




 I bet he's aiming for a cushy position at Fox News. 




 It really depends on if the candidates see the cycle as competitive. The 2008 primary was competitive for the Democrats as there was a huge backlash against Bush, so Obama and Clinton jumped in early. This year, because the race is seen to be not very competitive at all (basically Clinton is likely to wipe the floor against many Republican candidates), you have a lot of people who are sitting back and waiting. You don't want a long and protracted campaign to dig up skeletons and have unintentional media snafus. 




 I think that was the plan, until the Bourne Legacy came out. It's clear he doesn't have the acting chops to hold a franchise on its own. 




 In 2004 I did some lab work on instruments that ram windows 98. Currently I regularly use biotechnology instruments that run Vista. Can't upgrade them because it would break the software. 




 There have been quite a few studies that show its virtually impossible to get a large number of people to switch from driving to public transit for their commutes. All that happens is that people who use public transit will use it more. 




 Do people really think toxins live in your gut like worms? If anything toxins are in your bloodstream. Your liver and kidney will take care of it. 




 Yes, but at the pace things are coming out now, it's pretty clear that Nadella is completely responsible for stepping on the accelerator pedal. 




 Not to mention that every few years they decided to completely "revamp" it for no good reason. Kind of like Google Talk/Hangouts too. 




 I'm not sure what the fuck happened to Google Maps, but the desktop version has steadily gone downhill. It used to be fast and functional, but now they are trying to copy too much of the mobile UI. They also had other neat features like elevation which were removed and "will be put in later", as if they had to invent that code from scratch.

The most infuriating thing is trying to plan public transit rides with the desktop application. Why the fuck am I scrolling down to see the timetable move sideways? That breaks so many rules in UI design. 




 Also, what the fuck was with that guillotine style chopping. These are the basic techniques: http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/05/draftknife-skills-the-three-basic-knife-cuts.html 




 I think in the past decade, a lot of amazing progress has been in blood cancers. Carcinomas are turning out to be many big beasts. 




 I'm Canadian, and I don't really understand how our health care system works. How is it that we can go to a hospital and get major surgery done for what we contribute in taxes but once we go to Shoppers we have to pony up? My guess is that routine pharmaceuticals that you get in the consumer side of things is a tiny fraction of medical costs (even the really expensive drugs are administered only at hospitals), so it doesn't even make monetary sense for the government to withhold this benefit. 




 This is a great answer. With fields like bioinformatics there are a lot of opportunities, especially since the barrier to hiring is a lot less as compared to lab bench positions. The only question is whether you will find a job that you find fulfilling. 




 The problem is that lab experience doesn't mean anything in the workplace. It means you worked a few hours a week on brief modules with a protocol in front of you. That doesn't make you competitive.

The reason why lab internships are so useful because it demonstrates that you have problem solving skills and can apply protocols to situations outside of a classroom laboratory. For example, there is a huge difference between cloning a strain and purifying a protein in a class lab versus your PI telling you to clone an arbitrary ORF and then purify it. The latter makes you actually think and understand the process and that's what employers are looking for.

The actual field isn't important -- the key factors are that you've done things with your hands and mind outside of the class lab. 




 The difference is that a Bachelor's degree will eventually "top off" unless you have a special talent or if you are an entrepreneur. 




 Hong Kong-born here, I'm not really sure what the fuss over Infernal Affairs was. It was very similar to a lot of other gangster movies released from HK in that time period. That and the female leads were absolutely horrendous and the dialog was terrible. Not sure if understanding Cantonese made the difference, but I felt that The Departed, while being much longer-winded, was a much better movie. 




 But this is a problem for contracts and loans made in USD. I'm assuming it's a not-insignificant portion of the economy. Russia had this same problem a few months ago. 




 Or any contracts/loans made out in USD just got 35% more expensive.

Seriously, some people think this is great news, but nobody was cheering when Russia's currency collapsed. 




 With a bigger picture: the Euro-zone finally got their head out of their asses with austerity and is implementing QE after the Americans have had huge success with it. But they are a little too late as the US is now switching tracks to raise rates. Because they are going in diverging directions, we can expect a double whammy effect. 




 Related: in the Bay Area there is an ice cream sandwich shop called CREAM. 




 Haven't read the paper, but do you know if they've tried this technique with undefined rich media? It seems like a lot of labs would try that route first. 




 Also hilarious considering historically the aluminum MacBooks had all sorts of heating problems. 




 The 13" MBP is absurdly light for its performance. It definitely punches above its weight. 




 Get a 13" MBP. It costs around the same as the 2015 MacBook, has literally 10x the performance, retina screen, and extra ports. You would never be worried about performance, and the thing is honestly not that heavy. 




 By that logic they would have used the Air moniker for the new iPhones.
