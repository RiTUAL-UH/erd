 Jesus Christ. I should have stopped reading. I babysit for a living right now. Jesus Christ. 




 "A gay?" 




 No, you're right. He made fairly good money. But I can imagine that having to drive extraordinarily dark and scary stretches of road would compel certain people to purchase one. It's also worthy of note that 90's also covers 1999. Also, I'm prone to saying "ten years ago" and meaning the 90's, even though that's clearly not correct. But part of this sub is no disbelief so lets just go with it! 




 My uncle had a cell phone in the 90's. He was a tech guy. 




 I'd advise not coming within 50 feet of nosleep. 




 Salt all your windows and doors. Wear or carry a piece of sterling silver. And I'd suggest some research into your foster care files as well as if it's possible that you were conceived as part of a set of twins, and only you survived. Please keep up updated, OP, even if it's just to let us know how you're doing.  




 I totally get it. I describe the inside of my head as a fish tank bubble machine. I'd absolutely love to know more but all in your time, as you're ready. :)

 I would love to know more! 




 Where did this go?! :( 




 Poor Syd. And poor you. But at least he got to stop suffering.  




 So you're aware that N1 is in love with you right?  




 And a more irritating, mind numbing, more aggressive in retaliation to the SJWs, place.  




 In real life I'm actually a super kind and understanding person. What irks me is that all of a sudden society has to cowtow to weakness. I've seen trigger warnings in college syllabi. I think that's absolutely ludicrous. Real life doesn't come with trigger warnings. There's not gonna be someone to warn you if you're about to walk out the door to see an assault and no one is going to cover your eyes when you see bad things happening. I think that instead of letting the fear and "triggers" win, people who can't handle it should get the help they need from a professional and learn coping skills. 




 Yes lets make a big stink about someone quoting a song. Go be a SJW somewhere that isn't /nosleep. We don't need your kind in our safe place. 




 It's the hot/crazy scale dude. I know it well. 




 "Triggering" shouldn't even be a word. Grow up and get a grip. 




 You are my favorite. 




 Finally someone singing my song! Trigger warnings breed weakness. Learn to deal with your shit or the world will destroy you. 




 More please! 




 Leave him at the fire station and move on with your life. They won't even look for you. 




 It's true. I wasn't saying they were the same thing, necessarily, just that there were similarities it might have helped OP to read. On how to deal with it, etc. 




 Them! 




 Yes! 




 Yes! 




 There are other stories that reference a woman doing that. I don't know how to find them and link them for you though. Anyone else? 




 Not sure what's up with the formatting, but it's kinda unreadable. I'll check back soon because I want to read this! 




 Er....
Wrong thread? 




 I don't know why this is removed, but I want it back. I have so many questions. 




 Alternatively, demonic Rugrats! 




 My dog's name is Abigail and she sits at the food of my bed every night waiting for me to get her spot ready. This is extra creepy. Did you survive it OP? 




 The real world is not gonna provide you with warnings. You have to function on society. You have to go places, work places, shop places. Anything can happen and no one is going to warn you. 




 I KNOW. I read them all in once sitting and then I was like high on all of the words. My eyes wouldn't close and my brain wouldn't stop running. Lol. 




 It's called coddling people in a society that is going to beat the shit out of them, and never so much as let them know what's coming. "Trigger warnings" and the like, breed weakness and a false sense of importance. 




 Call a doctor if it lasts more than 4 hours! 




 Real life doesn't come with trigger warnings. 




 Mine sounds like a freaking carebear. 




 Okay. Good. I'm really not a bitch. 3 




 If you identify as a woman, than you can be any kind of woman you'd like. Butch, femme, somewhere in between, whatever. It's really that simple. Being cis or trans doesn't make you less or more of a woman than anyone else.

What I actually meant is that in my community a lot of the cis-women who are "butch" at some point in their lives, actually end up later on coming out as trans (FTM.) I'm simply asking a question about what people see in their own communities and if the image that I have is something that still exists in today's society. 

Please don't come here looking for an argument. I'm not insulting or "erasing and excluding" anyone. If you feel that way then you may need to address your own insecurities and status as a "victim." I often come across as harsh because I don't lie, or sugar coat, and I don't believe in pandering to insecurities. It is how it is.  




 Well now... I hadn't really ever thought of it like that. Of course there is a sense of security, but I've always protected myself. I can also fix the plumbing, the car, and do basic carpentry. I'm pretty self sufficient and maintain that even in relationships (which has been a problem in the past, I'm "too independent.")So what I'm "looking for" is someone who can match that. But this isn't a post about me seeking someone, it's just asking if people like that exists in other communities. 




 Hey okay so I didn't say people who weren't butch wouldn't have the same characteristics. I'm actually just simply asking if what I'm describing exists in other communities because it doesn't in my own.  




 Thanks! Haha. I'm just checking other communities because here it seems like most girls are just gay to make a political statement. 




 I do. Hence the title of the post being "Butch Women!" And that's also what I'm asking about. Is do BUTCH WOMEN exist anymore? Are they in your community? Etc. 




 You may have hit the nail on the head. I think that's exactly the image I see. Of course I also grew up in a junk yard and am friends mainly with "car guys" to get my fix, but I'm the only lesbian for miles at car meets and I'm femme! 




 It's funny you mention that. Where I grew up it's very conservative and exactly as you said, less colorful. Even the lesbians fit into gender roles, you know? Femme and butch. Unfortunately there's really nothing in the world that makes me melt like a good strong butch and they just don't exist here. 




 You'd think! 




 I guess as a femme I don't see butch as a deliberate thing, but more as just who someone is. You know? But I can see what you're saying. What is the gay community like where you live?
