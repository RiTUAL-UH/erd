 What thread are you talking about? 




  Sitting in a puddle of self pity waiting to feel better is the new norm.

Based on what? Your own opinion? 




 *Doesn't move a muscle until nightfall* 




 How does this offer any practical advice to OP? 




  anything would be better.

Okay, let's draw a massive schlong that spouts anti-something hate. 




 BY GAWD JACKSON IS BROKEN IN HALF 




 Still waiting for you to throw the first stone at this guy, Pretty.  




 You typed an essay when you could have summed up everything in a couple sentences: Witcher already had most of the concept art (e.g. Geralt's design) and the engine done. Star Citizen is a new company making something from scratch. 




 It's shaped like a diner! And it's on this really tall pole! 




  I have a 10 year old cousin who is constantly raving about Five Nights at Freddy's, the Slenderman game, Flappy Bird, Angry Bird and all kinds of mobiel games, but has no idea what Grand Theft Auto, Metal Gear Solid or Rayman are.

Who fucking cares? Tastes change and a 10 year old shouldn't be playing MGS and GTA in the first place. 




 not concept art 




 Well if you are a Christian, you believe God has spoken for himself as Jesus Christ 




 M'lady 




 Oh that man is sick!! 




 The Supreme Court...What great men he would join: John Marshall, Charles Evans Hughes, Warren Berger... Mmmmmmm... Berger... 




 All of you people are such fucking hypocrites. You yell to the moon telling people not to pre-order any game but when reddit gives its bullshit seal of approval to one developer, pre-orders are suddenly okay? Fuck off 




 Watch Cowboy Bebop. 




 Damn, gets my vote 




 This isn't for me, but for my brother. He was born with [sotos syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotos_syndrome); a defect in one of his proteins at birth caused over-growth, but delayed intelligence. He is 16 right now but acts more like a 10-11 year old.

Me and my brother, the older siblings, are okay - no disabilities or anything. We're both on-off wrestling fans, but our little brother has been a fan for years. One of his favourites is Bret Hart and I am sure it would make the year to him to meet Bret in person (he's only been to a house show; big John Cena and Big Show fan). 




 These pants were suppose to be baggy...baggy! 




 He-he. Best in the West. That rhymes! 




 How can someone abuse their body like that?? Moe! Don't throw out that [brine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine)! *proceeds to drink entire jar* 




 The high me really thinks this is funny. 




 I'm a bad wittle boy 









 The ring came off my pudding can 




 Were you sent here by the devil? 




 Keep watching the skis! I mean sky's... 




 Well that's just luvoly 




 Alalallalallal 




 I hope someone got fired for that blunder 




 Just a fun idea some architect firm whipped up. Unrealistic and will never be built; but now the company is on various news sites so the plan for exposure worked 




 Tyson Kidd and Nat are both Canadian. What makes their team "European" other than Swiss Cesaro? 




 You're going to have a great time.

My brother is mentally disabled and when we went to a house show, the guys brhind us were chanting John Cena SUUUUCKS. My bro turns around and gave them them YOU CANT SEE ME hand wave and they shut up. 




 Oh, everything's cruel according to you. Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel. Pulling on his tail is cruel. Yelling in his ears is cruel. Everything is cruel. So, excuse me if I'm cruel! 




 Nazi supermen are our superiors 




 Or the Albert Brooks various guest appearances which were all great 




 Outta my way, jerkass! 




 3ds max for modeling, photoshop for texturing and marmoset toolbag for rendering

 Thanks, Battlestar Galactica 




 Mark V-B, one french used 




 Lol 




 One that's pretty well on their way to becoming a robot. If some dude with magnets in his hand makes him a cyborg, then we've had cyborgs forever cause people with metal plates in their head. 




 Will it be yoooou? 

Well, yeah, it's my job, isn't it? 









 And remember that time I let that escaped lunatic in the house because he was dressed as Santa Claus? Well you have a gambling problem. 




 Maybe he misses his old glasses 




 My Catholic sex ed (as was my science teaching) was pretty good to be fair. I am willing to bet most people protesting are more in the Evangelical strain of Christianity 




 I have the exact same setup, including resolution and RAM. Runs about 45-60FPS (45 if there's lots of shadows/effects and its crowded, such as driving in traffic with gunfire at sunset).

But my game does freeze and crash a lot. Don't know why. 




 Get it off nuuvem for $35. All you need is Hola unblocker 




 I crash in the middle of the tutorial race 




 Get that clickbait shit outta here 




 Yes, especially with OP's slow-ass career 




 Baby on board...something something, Burt Ward 




 The All-Ighty...Ollar? Oh, I get it! 




 I said ha ha. 









   Consumers are begging for something new and creative.

No they're not. Maybe consumers on Reddit, but your average gamer still buys Call of Duty and Battlefield every year. 




 The level where you invade the kidnapper's home and find him in his basement with all the mannequins still gives me chills. 




 He's a Nazi, get him! 




 Get out here boy; there's a doin's a transpirin' ! 




 Maybe in 50 years... 




 Probably one of us 




 The 3D/game artist in me loves this game. The gamer in me does not. For $6 its worth it 




 TERROR LAKE SALUTES HANNIBAL CROSSING THE ALPS 




 18,000 letters, all addressed to Santa Claus 




 I am a 3D art student, in game development; do you have a portfolio or anything? What kind of art do you enjoy the most? 




 I dunno, some of those guys in ISIS give a VIDEO GAMES JOURNALIST a run for his money. 




 Oversized lizards 




 No, let's poke him a little while longer 




 LOOK WHAT HAPPENED WITHOUT MY PILLS 




 Uh-huh, and how is the launch going? 




 Be an astronaut? Sure! 




 I may be just an ordinary, blue collared slob but I know what I likes on TV...hold on a second...*flush* 




 Seth will bonk Lita? 




 Extra bonus if you bought it for XXXI, you get Extreme Rules in the same month 




 Vince becomes Mr. Burns? 




 Part of me feels it was cut short due to the Wyatt ankle injury 




 Grats man, must have been tons of fun. Post some pics! 




 Maybe lets them continue the feud to next year's Mania? 




 "This is it...I got to knock him out" *swing....* SETH ROLLINS HAS ARRIVED 




 I enjoyed watching Reigns get the shit kicked out of him for 15 minutes 




 Well before Lesnar re-signed, they were for sure going to make Reigns the winner 




 Yeah I thought they did a great job with the booking. 




 Most people won't have a clue who Balor is 




 Well Homer, here's ten dollars, why don't you plow it again? 




 It tastes great, makes women more attractive and makes a person virtually invulnerable to criticism. 




 See that ping sound means the spit was on target. 




 Alcoholic 




 Looks like a jolly rancher 




 Don't touch my stuff! Hey, this isn't the YMCA 




 I like the way Snrruuub thinks 




 I definitely have breast cancer, maggle 




 Guild Wars 2 and ESO have the largest RP communities. 




 Hey, you really suck McBain 




 well they're not wrong 




 Fine, spend money to access the alpha of a free game where microtransactions are working before most of the core gameplay features. Makes no fucking sense to me financially, but what do I know?
 




 I have the DayZ standalone and that pushed me to never buy into Early Access again. H1Z1 and DayZ are nearly the exact same game, running on different engines with a couple of different items. 




 How does one get 200+ hours of enjoyment via picking berries and scavenging around an empty, relatively bland world? 




 Anyone, pref. a face - [Alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY3Fwmlg5ZI) by Eliot Lipp 




 Ha aha aha...*raises shotgun*...but seriously, give me the money. 




 Stand up for yourself, poindexter 




  don't say swears

On the Internet too, like any of these discussions have any merit
