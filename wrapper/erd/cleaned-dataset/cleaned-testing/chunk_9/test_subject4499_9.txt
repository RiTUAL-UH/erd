 Coconuts? 




 Keep doing what you're doing man, looks mint. 




 Mmmmm meat. 




 Before I delete this failed post I want to say this made me laugh like an idiot. 









 In peace.

 Please ignore my shitty grenade placements, can't hit a homerun every single time.

 At least we have the ability to record smoothly now. If we get super cereal with this, an upgrade to our soft/hardware would be a good idea.

 I hold onto hope very tightly. 




 And affect our psyches it did. 




 Viking runs on horrible managerial decisions. I stopped caring a long time ago. 




 It sucks. 




 I've mentioned this before in a similar thread a while back. Balzac meats is what you're looking for, trust me on this.

[Ignore the person bitching about the service there, they are a whinny little shit](http://mobile.yp.ca/bus/Alberta/Rocky-View-County/Balzac-Meats/1777482.html)

The place is definitely not run by Walmart greeters, they are oldschool farm folk. Best fucking steak you'll ever eat.

 Loves me some Fever Ray, good song choice for this montage. 




 Thanks man! 




 I just noticed you can see my hand and phone in the bottom left corner of the second picture. Also, your dad didn't know about the panoramic option of the iPhone, I gave him a heads up. 




 It tells me that it loves you too. 




 Absolutely. 




 I can't complain. 




 Yeah, it seems fairly intense from the photo. 




 Fucking awesome man, thanks. Totally saving that one. 




 Haha I totally do, him and I were taking these pictures together. That's hilarious. 




 I appreciate that. 




 Didn't mean to shock you, but funny all the same. 




 Thanks. 









 Wat. 




 It's alright, they didn't have a full game either. 




 I usually put mine to sleep during the longer periods of not using it.  




 Nah a bunch of them have been marked down like that for a few months now. I definitely would have doubled up if I had attended any of those shows. 




 It has been for a loooong time. I'm always checking back for goodies. 




 Thanks for that. I do keep all of my important data on my machine, on two externals on site, as well as on a cloud service. 









 We had a good run. 




 Happy hunting man. Try eBay?

 That venue, that album, that trip was the best thing my wife and I ever did together I think.  




 I went back to my home town where I met some old friends at a pub on a week night, it was absolutely deserted. We had control over the jukebox the entire time so it was awesome. Anyway, the first song I put on was leathers, and the girl behind the bar mistook the silence at the beginning as a volume issue and cranked the speakers to the fucking max. All of us, including myself almost had heart attacks together. What a laugh. 




 I totally meant to put that in my title, sorry. 









 Their web store periodicslly sells new copies, just keep checking back.  




 And I too agree with social responsibility. 




 Canadian here, we like easy money too. 




 100% with you on that. 









 Needless to say, ranking should be the next thing fixed. 




 I feel you pain. 




 Yeah maybe you're right. 




 I'm finding it worst than ever it seems. I remember getting neck and neck matches before, but now it's just a complete slaughter one way or the other. 




 MCC is working and looking fantastic, but what's with the goddamn skill gap? I either go up against an elite team of professional halo players or I go up against a team of people who seem like they haven't touched an Xbox controller before, let alone played halo. 

Am finding it very frustrating and wanted to vent, sorry. But is anyone else experiencing this? 




 I've only subscribed three days ago, but from what I gather it's surrealism at its finest. 




 actually what the fuck 




 If We Had Parrots We'd Be Perfect

I might actually learn guitar and form a band now.

 Ah, the meat playground, the good old days. 




 Creepy.

 There is no Jesus only Zuul! 




 Beauty is in the eye of the beholder? 




 Dark, ugly, tragic. Common themes in some of the more powerful art forms. I would file this "comic" under surrealism, which never seems to have a point on the surface, but makes the onlooker dig deeper in themselves for an answer. 




 They weren't shown enough love growing up? 









 Aaaaaaand this is why I don't upload pictures of my kids to the Internet. 




 [Why wait?](http://i.imgur.com/n5CR6ju.gifv) 




 [How about this?](http://i.imgur.com/pfAjttq.gif) 




 Apology accepted. 




 My brain does all the noticing, I've learned not to argue with it. 




 How about that tension bluray? 














 Lol. 









 Woah, thank you. I feel I am a pretty driven person, and that hard work is always worth the effort. Although, as I've mentioned I plan on utilizing these skills more towards photography, and not so much as a designer. I aim to be a well rounded person, and feel the skills learned with this would go a long way with what I want to achieve.

As for the "industry hacks" you've mentioned, I believe they exist in every trade, lord knows they did/do in my current industry (aircraft repair). I still managed to push through and maintain a valuable career all the same. But as it's a dying industry, and the thought of losing my job is taxing on my mind, I feel it's time to make change. There's no better time than now, as they say. Thanks again for your input. 




 I'll hit you up after work, I'll need some time to go through mountains of data and see what I think is worthy of representing myself with haha. 




 I have never actually comprised a portfolio, it's always been just a hobby for me. It's only lately I've decided to actually switch gears and move my life in this direction. Having said that, I will definitely take you seriously and will attempt to put something together. I should mention, I currently use a Rebel XSI, something I purchased in 2008, the camera that really sparked by attention. I am currently in the market for the Mark III, but am weighing my options against the Nikon 810A, I may wait it out for the new Canon line and focus on my education. Until then however, I feel I would be better represented by more experience with better equipment. Let me know what you think, and thanks. 




 That is fantastic to hear. Appreciate your input, thanks. 




 I feel like I write "thank you" on reddit a lot, but this is the best corner of the internet IMO. Thanks man, and I will take your advice. 




 Woah, this is awesome, I will definitely sign up. Thanks! 




 I do consider myself artistic, and I love digital photography. I would love nothing more than to work for myself someday. I would love to be fluent in graphic design, and be able to edit photos with ease, as time is money. This is a place I've always thought I belonged, but have chosen technical trades instead, as time goes by, I feel it's time for change.  




 I am looking to get into wedding photography, and wanted to further my editing skills. So I wouldn't go as far to say graphic design as a career, but I think the tools offered by this course would greatly enable my ability. Thank you very much for you input. 




 Was wondering if anyone here had gone through the [graphic design course at SAIT](http://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/continuing-education/courses-and-certificates/graphic-design-certificate-of-achievement.php), and if so did you think it was worth it? 

I want to make sure it's not just a bunch of outdated videos, and is actually a valuable experience. Thanks in advance. 




 [Would anyone be interested in my Vive platform?](http://i.imgur.com/mHD7q6P.png) 




 To each their own brother. Thanks for the input. 




 Haha I used to have that exact same anxiety, until one day I just said fuck it, and made myself get better. Also, Halo 3's "Splockets" game type helped me tremendously. 




 Thanks. 









 At the bottom of one of the towers there's the room you see the guy in at the end of the video.

 Haha, crossfire is so awesome. I remember back in the day when I acidentally found the secret stash room and got called out for cheating. 




 Thank you very much for this. 




 Hello, thanks for your reply. Here's [a thread I started in /r/neuroscience](http://www.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/2xaet8/first_time_poster_in_this_sub_but_seemed_to_be/) just before asking the question here. That should supply a little more info. 




 Thank you very much for your insight and kind words. I wouldn't deny the fact that abnormal myelination could be a hard thing to see outside a trained eye. Maybe I've watched too many episodes of house, and have always pictured a diagnosis like this to be broken down in a very basic visual presentation. I just want to see it for myself, and have explained to me what I'm seeing. I'd love nothing more than to compare my son's MRI with a "healthy" one.

We already have an appointment with another neurologist, and as he's a colleague of our current doctor I'm hoping for an unbiased assessment. Only time will tell at this point. Thanks again. 









 Recently my wife and I have been told by a neurologist our son (2.5years old) may have a condition known as [pelizaeus merzbacher disease](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PelizaeusMerzbacher_disease). Based on his early development of nystagmus, current state of ataxia, and apparent low myelin formation on his MRI. As you can imagine we are taken back by this, especially while we wait for confirmation through genetic testing.

I've asked the doctor to please show us his MRI, and she has avoided this for almost two months now. Everytime I bring it up it seems she avoids it, explaining it would be of no use to us as "it's incredibly hard to spot". No matter how much I insist, we never get a chance to examine our son's MRI. So my question is this, how hard is it to actually see low myelin formation? Should I be concerned with how the neurologist is handling this? We are very scared, and it seems no one has any answers. I should mention I do not have a background in medicin, just an average blue collar worker.

Thank you very much.  




 Bioluminescence? Specular reflection? 




 Oh come on Mr. Poop, you're not fooling me with that again. 




 What's your phone number? 




 Quad fold bluray jacket with a live show from each album era OR a double album OR Tool/Motrhead split album covering each other's material OR Aenima vinyl repress OR guest bassist Paul D'Amour laying down some material for the new album? 




 They're invisible. Black magic cloak. 




 Double album live bluray boxset confirmed. 




 Don't. It's down. 




 Does this qualify as proof?

[http://i.imgur.com/6PXmABz.png](http://i.imgur.com/6PXmABz.png) 




 How can I prove this is an act of coincidence and not some devious ploy to garner internet points? 









 Hey thanks, just wish it was a higher resolution. 




 It wasn't my intention to stalk you, sorry! 




 Buy, buy, buy, their old record! 




 Haha, understandable. 




 Thanks man. 




 I pinned the camera against the glass wall at the top of the tower. I found 5 or 6 pictures, this was the best one.

 Bingo bango, sugar in the gas tank. 




 Half Life on PC. 




 The Exorcist - When Kinderman visits Chris after Dennings was thrown down the stairs. Then of course the epically fucked up scene that followed. 




 First time hearing it? 




 Agreed. I once read his diet consists of steak and that's it. 




 I feel the sound on the Between The Buried   Me: Live at the Fidelitorium bluray has the best sound of any concert bluray or dvd that I own.

I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's so well done I had to make mention of it.
