 Liars and Fools 




 Sofa fm boot liquor is an online radio station I would give a listen to, it has many of the artists suggested along with a variety of others. I'd say it's a good place to start. 




 Lonely Too Long or In My Arms Instead 




 Grab a snack, it's a long list: The Hours, Chicago, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Beautiful, Sugar and Spice, Simone, Miss Congeniality, Looper, Gravity, Unforgiven, The Proposal, The Housesitter, Star Wars: A New Hope, Wag the Dog, All About Eve, Singin' in the Rain, Little Miss Sunshine, Funny Girl.

I made my own movies as a kid, wrote my own scripts as a teen, and watched a lot of movies. I don't watch as many as I used to but these have always stuck out as my favourites whether or not they're critically acclaimed. 




 Clarke Griffin from The 100. She's so badass. 




 I think that's what it is. Thanks! 




 Okay this seems familiar. Thanks for the help! 




 My trainer came up with a routine I can do while I'm traveling and don't have access to a gym. One of them is titled as a dumbbell burpee and the instructions are to row on each arm, push up, and then lunge on each leg. 

I don't remember doing this since I was super tired the day we went through this workout. I'd rather not bother my trainer at this time since its late. 

Anyone know what exercise this is? I'm at a loss of exactly how I should be performing it. Google isn't any help. 




 Kenny Chesney is pretty entertaining, so should be a good show overall. Have fun. :) 




 I can't answer how long his set will be just that you should go. I saw Eric Church recently and he puts on a great country-rock show.  




 I remember seeing that as well but can't find it now.

 I think it was my first grade teacher. She was really pretty and really nice. She went on maternity leave before school was out. I still kind of remember her all these years.   First girl crush that I was completely aware of was on this girl in high school. She knew I liked her because I told her. Anyway, she married a guy and they have a kid now. I feel weird whenever I see her now because I turn into that awkward and shy 16 year old all over again.

 I think she was purposely trying to speak "clearly" to be understood by the American guests which made Graham laugh. 




 I was 10, too. I was playing in front of my house when I was catcalled by a guy driving by in a car. I was too busy playing to pay attention. The only reason I remember it at all was because my 14 year old brother came storming out of the house, chasing the car, and yelling at the guy. 




 So glad I got to see them when they toured Canada. 




 Oh, too late, I already bought it. :-/ 




 St. Vincent has more albums?!? I really need to download the rest of her albums.
