 Not once did I ever say that the civilian killed the police K9 intentionally. You are imagining that fact for the sake of your argument. 

Clearly you are as ignorant as you are stupid. This conversation is not worth continuing. Thanks for nothing and go fuck yourself. 

Also, for the record, you said "utter retarded" and you're preaching about *my* education? 




 :( 




  No, you point was that you are equating an action with intent to the same as a negligent action, which are two very separate acts.

You're gonna tell me what my own point was? I just told you what my point was. A police K9 is a police officer regardless of circumstances. That is my point. Whether negligent or intentional, regardless of **who** injures the dog, it should be considered an **officer** uniformly in all cases. Do you have anything to say about that point? 




 Oh how I wish this were real. 




 In one scenario a person willfully kills the animal while attempting to run from police.

Willfully kills the animal while attempting to run? That statement is an oxymoron. How can they willfully kill the animal while they are attempting to run away?

My point is that if a police K-9 is going to be considered "an officer", and criminals who harm said "officer" are charged the same as if they had harmed an actual police officer, than the same "officer" status should stand regardless of the circumstances.

The dog is an officer, so while the death may not have been intentional, it was caused by negligence and the police officer responsible should be charged accordingly as if the dog was a person who was unintentionally locked in the car and died. 

Enough with this double standard bullshit. The only thing asinine here is your lame analogy. 




 I'm not upset. Could care less either way. Simply having a conversation. 




 Nice, thanks. I looked it up on Google Earth, that's really out in the middle of nowhere. Closer to Turkey than the mainland of Greece. It's gonna take a lot more than the initial 4.5 mil to set up a power grid and infrastructure. Transportation to and from would be crazy expensive as well.

 Randy, ya big chode... I haven't seen you in ages! 




 Ohh ok, gotcha. Makes sense now.  




 Nice. 76% wouldn't be enough for me to risk 100 coins for a reward of 3 though. That's almost a 1 in 4 shot of losing. 




 Those seem like terrible odds. Not being familiar with the casino, what was he playing that he felt confident betting 330 coins for the chance to only win 100? And subsequently betting 100 just to win 3? 




 Get me... an avocado, a snorkel, and an ice pick... trust me bro, I've made bongs with less. 




 #WTF 




 Ok... you win... I'll do it.

But seriously, doesn't sound too difficult. Start by finding guys you think are attractive, it should only take a few minutes of talking with them to determine if they're a creep, and then the only real toss up would be whether or not they're down to take photos.  




 Definitely cut down on the nicotine level and see if you notice a difference. When i say sweating, I was dripping and it felt like my skin was radiating heat like it was some sort of super power. 

What many people don't realize is how much nicotine they are actually ingesting when using an e-cig, because they tend to puff on it much more casually and often than if they were smoking regular cigarettes. Not to mention that the filter in a regular cigarette does a lot to restrict the level of nicotine, tar, and other chemicals that make it into your lungs. 

Ever smoke a regular cigarette with no filter? Notice the difference and how easily it makes you light headed? I postulate that smoking an e-cig is not much different in terms of nicotine consumption, it's like smoking a cigarette unfiltered, (only without the tobacco and all the other harmful chemicals/carcinogens).

 Increased heart rate, chance of a temporary irregular heart beat. One time, when I first started vaping, I went really heavy on some 12mg juice. I experienced symptoms of what i think is a nicotine overdose where I became very dizzy, slightly nauseous, and I was sweating while my skin was basically radiating heat. Had to lie down on my bed for a bit and let it pass. That's about the time I switched to 3mg juice. 




 Aww... it's a flower! 




 Yuup. If you haven't found a fuck buddy yet, I can only assume you aren't looking very hard... or at all.

I googled that. 

But seriously, if you want to start a constructive dialogue, do it. 

Posting a snarky neckbeard meme is not constructive nor does it incite thoughtful discussion.

 You popped half a tab at 11PM and you have work at 7:30AM?

Not the best decision... for me, the trip will usually last about 8-12 hours depending on the potency and dosage (as each tab will have a different amt of actual LSD on it).

Very much a rookie mistake, if I were you, I would look into crafting up an excuse to call out of work tomorrow so that you can actually enjoy your trip. Sleeping on LSD has never been too easy for me, not to mention it would be a hell of a waste. 

 




 I'm with you, OP. Fuck the FDA.

Hang on to your jimmies, people! 




 They're always after me lucky charms 




 Bills have stated that they want McCoy to get 300+ carries. Fred Jackson probably won't be stealing too many touches from him.

On the other hand, DeMarco has Ryan Matthews and possibly sometimes Sproles who are willing and able to steal his touches.

Is this rushing yards only, or passing yards included as well?

Either way it is a toss up, but barring injury, as much as I hate to say it, I think Lesean has the advantage here strictly due to his lack of competition for touches.  




 Beautifully said, thanks for taking the time to write that out. 

All of the energy that existed in that "singularity" pre big bang, had to come for somewhere. I find it difficult to believe that it just infinitely "was". 

Is it possible that all that energy/matter that existed in the pre big bang singularity, was accumulated from somewhere much in the same way black holes absorb the matter/light/energy around them? 

I read somewhere that the ultimate fate of any simply expanding universe is to contain just one black hole which is so massive that it has swallowed up all the other black holes and subsequent matter (of course this would take a very long time), because there is no known "critical mass" for a black hole. 

Perhaps the end result of the universe is when every atom has been swallowed up into a giant black hole, then a critical mass in a sense has been reached and the resulting singularity explodes into another big bang.

And the cycle continues on and on...
 




 And what happens to the credit of the people who pay only 2k of their 10k bill, even if the hospital may be "satisfied" with receiving only the 2k? 

When compared to the healthcare systems in Canada, Australia, and Europe for example, it is clear that our American healthcare system needs a serious and immediate overhaul, and has for quite some time.  




   I think you misconstrue infinite universe with infinite size, but that's a meaningless statement for an infinite thing.

I think I do too.

How are they different? 




 Hitler wouldn't. 




 Hey guys look, we found Hitler's reincarnation.  




 Civilian kills police K-9 while fleeing; jailed for murder of an officer.

Police officer kills police K-9 due to negligence; leave with pay.  




 If the universe was postulated to have once been contained inside a tiny point (pre big bang), and has been continually expanding at an increasing rate ever since the big bang, how can it possibly be considered infinite? 




 Orange you glad I didn't say banana? 




 Banning is harsh, but why post it there in the first place? 




 If the universe is expanding in all directions, what is it expanding into? 




 HAHAHA

 #42 DOWN, 42 DOWN 




 Solid, solid advice.  




 Just the details and the way it's gone down. I've seen it many times in the past. Of course, I don't know you or her personally, that would make the diagnosis much more simple.

But as far as specifics, the sudden nature of it, the fact that you have been together for 4 years and are only 20 years old. Prime breakup time. Also a prime age where you meet a lot of new people. A lot of times it's a guy from work, could be a friend of a friend, probably someone she spends a lot of time around. 

The fact that she is keeping things open ended with you, in my opinion could mean she doesn't know where its going with the other guy, but she is free to do whatever she wants with you or him while she makes up her mind, because she is no longer in an official relationship. The fact that she is still sleeping next to you when she comes over and all that, shows that she still has interest in you, but that she feels guilty about what she's doing with the other guy and as a result doesn't want to take things further. 

What was her legitimate reason for ending things after 4 years? What about your relationship wasn't working out to her liking, that she couldn't handle?

A lot of times they won't tell you about the other guy because either they don't want to hurt your feelings, they don't want you going after the other guy, or they want to string you along on the back-burner, selfishly, in case things don't work out with the other guy. (or a combination of the three)

Either way, having lived through my 20's, it is far more common than you probably realize at this point in your life. It's unfortunate.  




 Not sure how I feel about this. Why not just offer them jobs?  




 You won't be laughing when those eggs hatch.  




 Two beantown creampies, please 




 See my previous statement. Edited it real quick. 




 ~~Who ended the relationship?~~ I see that she did. Unfortunately, this re-affirms my previous statement. Sounds like she met somebody else while you were together and was developing feelings for them, didn't want to be disrespectful to you / sneaking around, so she ended things (and left them open ended). Now she may be feeling conflicted, unsure of what she wants. 

I know it sucks, and this could very well not be the case, but I'm just speaking from general experience. Make damn sure though, because you should be keeping your own future and well being in mind. The legitimate reason for the breakup plays a huge role in what your next steps should be. 




 That sounds amazing.  




 Bacon sushi confirmed.
