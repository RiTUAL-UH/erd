 Just wait for him to get a bit older.  




 It could happen yet... 




 She gots her nails did. 




 Happy with the switch, very hard to look back. 




 ...or any number of other reasons. My son had torticollis, couldn't turn his head to the right. 




 Yeah we stuck an Evel Knievel sticker kit on our kid's lid, with his name on the back. Made him a bit of a star with the neighbourhood ladies. 




 Inflated? 




 That road was in the east.  




 HEE-HEE! 




 Forget about it, the Cavs just barely squeaked past a Hawks team minus Horford, Korver and Sefolosha. They had a hard fight against a Bulls team with a hobbled Noah, an absent/injured Pau Gasol and a terrible offense that seemed to rely on Derrick Rose prayers. Lebron is wearing down and cramping while playing massive minutes. I'm expecting a bloodbath in the finals. 




 He's 0-10 right now... 




 Gerald Green's gotta be up there. 




 Dunno why you're getting downvoted, that looks like the answer.  




 Of COURSE he is. Fucken.  




 Expose for the skin in the shadows, this blows the highlights out like that.  




 Yay Eastern conference. 




 Man those Hawks uniforms... *snif*

/Nique fan in the 80s. 




 Wasn't Penny a point guard? 




 Mate they've been playing on the BBC in the UK. It's everywhere.  




 But when they are... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alYUJbweWjc 




 Sorry to disappoint, I'm a writer and video producer and my editor spends all week trying to stop me being filthy at every opportunity. Sometimes he's successful... Either way this fart has been played all round the office, I hear it popping up on various computers a few times a day... People are getting sick of it but one of the finance guys reckons I'm a god. :) 




 Judges are good for giving technical feedback and educated performance notes, but they tend to reward accuracy over entertainment. You can't have competitions that are entirely audience judged either, or it becomes who brings the loudest friends. But if you focus on the audience you'll be a better act.  




 At the end of the day, the audience is all that matters.  




 "Sharon" is reluctantly proud, a state she spends a fair bit of time in.

 My pleasure! :) 




 Hahaha! :) 




 I was just the channel through which this entered the world.  




 That's just how good a fart it was. 




 I'm 38. Every fart is a free laugh waiting to be enjoyed. 




 She's so serious! That's pure gold. Tell them thanks, from the heart of my bottom. 




 Awesome mate, that warms the ol' cockles! 




 Synchronicity... We found out yesterday my wife's uncle only has a few days to live. I guess I made this thing as a bit of a reaction to some awful news. Look after your gal!  




 Ripped a couple this morning but nothing up to the Beethoven standard as yet.  




 You got me, I'm terrible with theory. :) 




 I was on a soft camping bed, my technique is usually solid. But I appreciate the tips! 




 Just checking my message history, his response was "I would wager that's the best thing you've discovered in 2015?" 




 No sir, if I could do this on purpose I'd be a rich and famous man. 




 I believe /r/farts is ready and waiting for your contributions! 




 PM me your email address, I've found only one other fart I didn't delete but I'll happily send it over. 




 I miss my brother, he's moved out of town. So I've been recording my farts and sending them to him so he doesn't get too homesick. 




 That makes me feel good, because my own mum is not so happy. 




 I'm not here to take your glory, but to inspire you. You'll make that name famous some day. 




 There are many people on here far more talented than me - if this fart got remixed, it'd be sensational! 




 Lay it on us. 




 If you're gonna steal from anyone, steal from the greats. Seems my arse has excellent taste, who knew? 




 I have a brother. He needed to hear them. 




 The guys in Eternityclub are all looking at me funny.  




 I can't remember, I'll have to ask the lads that were in the room at the time. 




 I sure hope so! 




 On me phone. Yep, farted on me phone. I am not a smart man. 




  /r/EternityClub: front page posters only

You may be right... I didn't spend that much time on this, because, well, you don't expect it to be the fart that brought the world together on one day in May. 




 Ten points if you whistle the fart symphony during honeymoon sex.  




 Right, I'm going to bed. The last few hours have been truly exhilarating. Thousands upon thousands of people have listened to my greatest fart, and my arse now has an agent. I'm just not sure how tomorrow is going to get any better. But you never know. 




 I was recording all my farts at the time, to send to my brother. 




 Hahahahahahahaha

edit: god it just keeps going, I love it! 




 I totally sing that one in the band... Maybe that's where my date got it from! 




 Tomorrow is a new day, and now you have a perfect recording device in your pocket at all times. You got this! 




 I'm not ready for instant rectal fame and fortune, my butt would be flogged out after a 90-minute show. 




 I was recording all my farts to send to my brother. He's moved out of town. 




 Send us an audition tape. 




 Here's to you! 




 My pucker has brought a lot of happiness to the world this day. I'm going to buy it a lollipop. 




 Nope, that's all yours! 




 Stralia mate! 




 Five year olds, they know what's up.

What a resource! 




  second musical idea in Movt 3 of Beethoven's 6th.

I just don't think I'll ever be able to fart that fast. 




 I'm a dad. It could happen to you. 




 I thought about it, but I couldn't be stuffed opening Logic and I dunno how to autotune in Garageband. Now I'm kind of regretting that I didn't hire a proper orchestra. 




 Tell him the fart guy says "high five..."

And then when he puts his hand up, grab it and tickle the little dude like mad. :D 




 /u/hacksilver found it! https://youtu.be/iQGm0H9l9I4?t=1429 




 They would all sound incredibly pedestrian next to this one. 




 18th in Australia buddy! G'day from down under. 




 There's always that risk. 




 See this kind of thing makes it all worthwhile. You have a great day mate! 




 I've seen one live, twice - Mr. Methane. He brought the house down, awesome stuff. 




 I just use the Android sound recorder and share 'em via Message. A warning though, if you start doing this, you will be farting on your phone a lot. And then you might be putting it close to your face. Just sayin'. 




 I don't see why not. 




 Lately, yeah. I send them to my brother.

He doesn't send anything back. 




 I mean, I'd like to... 




 Tell me about it, I just signed a licensing agreement for my bunghole. I'm not even joking. 




 I sure hope you're right. 




 I'm gonna go ahead and take a guess that this is more of a boy thing. 




 hahahaha excallent! 




 MY GOD MAN I THINK YOU FOUND IT! 




 Any chance you can dig up a link on that? 




 Listen to it, man. I mean really listen. It's a beauty. Farts like that come along what, once a month? 




 My brother moved out of town, I started texting him my farts so he wouldn't feel so homesick. 




 Just ask away, man. What do you need to know? 




 HAVE A RIPPER DAY MATE! :) 




 My brother moved out of town, I started texting him my farts so he wouldn't feel too homesick. 




 I'm not sure I can really take the credit here. My bunghole did most of the work. But it does seem to be making a lot of people happy, which is not something many bungholes get to do. 




 If you see it, tape it for me. That would make my year. 




 We can only hope. 




 My brother moved an hour away, and I was missing him. I started texting him my farts so he wouldn't get homesick... But when this one came out, I knew it was special.
 




 Right there with you, man - I'm gonna go to bed soon knowing that by the time I wake up, hundreds of thousands of people all over the world will have listened to my pucker. My eyes are red, from crying so much, from laughing so much. My stomach is actually sore. The world is a wonderful place. 




 No. I plan to keep on farting until another movement comes out. 




 My brother moved away from town, and I was missing him. So I started texting him farts to let him know I love him. This would have been in the first dozen or so, but the second it came out I knew it was special. 




 Hahahahahahaha I'm in tears here! 




 You turn your back for ONE MINUTE..... 




 On a serious note, my missus is certain she's heard that melody somewhere before in a classical piece. Perhaps Vivaldi? If there's any classical music aficionados out there, I'd love to know if my butt is a plagiarist. 




 How many beautiful tunes have been carried off on the wind, never to be heard again? 




 You never know, your butthole might be the next Wagner. I never knew the talent I was sitting on. 




 I have no idea, but it kinda works...? 
Hahahaha! 




 Then my Sunday was well spent. :) 









 Theo Ratliff was the first to give him a high 5 on that game winner... Haha! 




 This - hitting shots is a 50/50 thing if you get a decent look. Getting a steal off a storied rival all-star, on the most crucial play of a Finals game, then creating a shot to end the perfect career... Gotta be MJ. 




 Amazing that he can lose traction on the painted lines so many times, and then just keep throwing it in there onto them. 




 I spent a couple months with an early production jigger from another company in my lid, it put me off HUDs altogether. Turns out it's a lot of extra shit to have in your helmet for what seemed to me to be very little benefit. 




 Ctrl-F Ephemeral Rift.... Yyyyyyup. 




 Ah you might have to pay for his stuff now, he used to keep a blog showing lighting setups and whatnot that I found very educational.  




 This guy used to post here heaps: http://www.koloskov.com/

His product stuff is great and he has a bunch of tutorials on his site.
