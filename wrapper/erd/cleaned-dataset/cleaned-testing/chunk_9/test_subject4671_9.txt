 I answered this above but i work on the [ATD-1 project](http://www.aviationsystemsdivision.arc.nasa.gov/research/tactical/atd1.shtml). i need to be able to run a full cockpit on my pc 




 simulation engineering! 




 i believe i have 3 8Gb sticks in. 




 I'm a simulation engineer. I work on the [ATD-1 project](http://www.aviationsystemsdivision.arc.nasa.gov/research/tactical/atd1.shtml) so basically lots of cockpit displays 




 I work at NASA and have 2 Titans and 24 GB of RAM.... 




 not necessarily lazy..just not typical. I've done a 100 kb swing 100 burpee 20 min time cap workout before..it's a mental struggle for sure and you will be sore the next day. 




 i'm just worried that regular season rondo cost us depth off the bench where we are now relying on charlie v. and richard jefferson to be impact players and that in the West you cant really afford to be losing games. 




 Something is off with this Mav's team since the Rondo trade..he played 34 minutes and had no points..I just dont see this mav's team threatening in the playoffs..ALSO learn to inbound the ball 




 you should post an OH squat form check. You don't have to pull the bar too far back on an OH squat. I struggled with my OH Squat for a long time until i figured i was pulling it back too far which put unnecessary pressure on my joints. I know a lot of people diss crossfit but i've found this box puts out good form videos..here's there [OH squat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiB0QkCgcs8) 




 a quick tip, you can place a weight on the ground in front of your bar on the deadlifts to keep the weight from rolling away from you like that. 




 ty! 




 This may be a really stupid question..but on radiant side, if i ward near the medium camp by the river(so that i can see the rune spawn area but also keep track of enemy's like pudge who may be waiting for hooks) do I block the ability to stack that camp? 




 hold it close to your chest like you are hugging it 




 like [this](http://images.lifescript.com/Media/Lifescript%20Media/Experts/Jorges%20Daily%20Fit%20Tips/jorge_hyperextension_on_swiss_ball.jpg?w=160 h=184 as=1) 




 played basketball(pickup) or soccer(club league) for 2 hrs a day during highschool.weighed 145 lbs(5' 11"). Went to college..had all you can eat meal plan..exit freshman year at 195. develop stomach ulcers during college back down to 175. Start real world job..eat out for lunch every day..up to 195.. do p90x..down to 165 and shredded(result post in history)..slowly bulk back up to 195 bc i dont stay working out.. Start crossfit... 
1.5 yrs later:
1RM squat 235lbs
1RM deadlift 325lbs
1RM c j 175lbs

now running ICF 5x5 just for fun..still going to gym consistently.
 




 Baze perfected this move at ODU lol 




 knees out is a que i use to make sure i'm opening my hips. It's exactly what it sounds like, as you send your hips back focus on your knees going out. [This picture](http://www.precisionnutrition.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/what-your-knees-should-not-be-doing-during-a-squat1.png) shows you what i mean..make sure your legs are like A.

As for the row..you can keep your grip wide if you have mobility issues..however think about pulling your elbows to the back of the room. It might have been the camera angle but it looked like you were doing a bent over high pull instead of a row 




 okay poor wording..i think the bar is going too far over his head(if you watch the video he hits the bottom peg on the camera left side) 




 squats: you are doing low bar so focus on sending your hips back hard and opening up your hips by driving your knees out. dont look down and i think that will fix your back rounding

bench press: hard to tell without a perpedicular vantage point but it seems you dont have a straight bar path. Looks like you are pushing towards your head a little bit(you almost hit the rack)

row: looks like your elbows aren't going back towards the wall but rather sideways during the lift. this would cue some shoulder pain. your end point should look more like [this](http://www.fitbie.com/sites/default/files/barbell-row-b-ex.jpg)

Sorry for the poor angle. Best i could do at the gym. I see some slight butt winking at the bottom and i should probably lock my wrists better. 




 this is the correct answer. Our coach has us do this weightless or with dumbbells during our oly cycles. 




 i think if you crank you elbows down and pull the bar into your back..this will solidify your back which will keep it more upright and will remove the "good morning" from you squat. 




 Hi all,

I have been doing crossfit for the past year and a half..for the last year I did a strength focus class that swapped between 3 month segments of WSSB style programming(1 heavy leg, 1 dynamic upper, rest, 1 dynamic lower, 1 heavy upper) and 3 months of oly lifting cycles. In that time my numbers went to:

Squat: 235 1RM

Front Squat: 185 1RM

Deadlift: 335 1RM

Press: 125 1RM

Clean   Jerk: 175 1RM

Bench: 145 1RM ( :( Sad Panda)

on the ICF 5 x 5 video he says to start at 75% of your 1RM for 5x5.should i still start at that weight even if I've been lifting for a longer period of time than a true novice? 




 Thanks! If you don't mind I have an objective question ... coming from LoL I know a dragon is worth a tower take down and that both those are equal to 2-3 deaths. I know 1 kill is worth 15-20 minion kills. Is there an equivalent in dota2? With this in mind I value midas BC I feel I can play safe enough to not die needlessly and use the midas to accelerate my farm which will accelerate my items . Im guessing that my assumption that tradeoff is "worth" may be incorrect  




 Here is a link to my [dotabuff](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/88614157)

I find that i'm comfortable with late game right click carries...and not 100% terrible with spell casters. Right now I'm working my way through the all hero challenge to get an idea of what every character can do.

here is a link to a recent game i had on slarder [link](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1082870278). If i remember correctly i felt like we were ahead in this game and then something happened where i went from carrying to weak...i think i made a bad item choice in buying bkb but i'm not sure

I had a history of playing LoL so don't be afraid to offer all levels of criticism 




 I've played 2 games today towards my all-hero challenge that have no game records and didnt count towards the challenge. 




 crossfit is a generic term..my box offers a "serious strength" class that while we do all those things, if you didnt see us every class you might never see us do it. We just focus our workouts towards strength instead of  metcons 




 personally i work better with a shorter rope..something that is slightly above my waist/around rib cage. i find it easier to spin a little quickly..and it forces me to keep my wrist down 




 i used to have this problem with kb swings but then realized i was exaggerating the arc in my back every time i swung. focus on keeping your core type and not "leaning back" with each swing 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/LoLeventVoDs/comments/2edy7a/s4_lcs_north_america_summer_playoffs/ 




 they also could have ap kog. either way if they take both that leaves...vayne? jinx? true the ran the lucian/syndra last game but idk if thats gonna do much vs adc trist and ap kog 




 the worst part is that tsm had picked nunu, lulu, and nami all but signaling that trist was incoming and dig didnt take it away 




 not really..just being able to macro well can get you masters in sc2..no micro needed. I was a high diamond in sc2 at one point and am struggling in silver 2 bc my micro sucks 




 i think thats bc i was trying to emphasize getting my hips back in that set...i'll work on trying to keep my chest up  more though 




 this me doing 135lb x 5. I feel right around this weight is where it becomes tough enough that my form starts to break down

 just wondering..have you been to crossfit hampton roads? 




 in norfolk crossfit 757...in hampton crossfit hampton roads 




 the owner of my box is her coach. from everything i've heard she's an awesome person 




 if you dont mind korean commentary: https://www.youtube.com/user/TVOngamenet/videos 




 2 things.. squeeze that ass at the top of every rep! imagine you are pinching a penny in between your cheeks! you never fully straighten after every squat see sec 4 on  [http://youtu.be/0rtvMZp1f3w]( http://youtu.be/0rtvMZp1f3w) for example.

also it looks like you are getting forward on your toes..focus on sending your hips back while pushing the knees out to open up the hips as you go down. this will also help you achieve better depth

 imo the Games' scoring doesn't reward the consistent guys (the guys who are finishing 10-20th every event) the way it does the top scorers. A terrible finish in a Games workout is nowhere near as crippling as it is at regionals, so long as you take top 3 on a few workouts. It rewards the top athletes, makes a terrible finish less significant, and kind of shafts the consistent middle of the pack athletes. 




 The Crossfit Games top 7 men under traditional scoring (same as regionals and open scoring)

1. Ohlsen - 110

2. Hackenbruck - 116

3. Khalipa - 123

4. Fraser - 127

5. Froning - 128

6. Bridges - 128

7. Panchik - 132 




 10 foot wall ball shots.. 24/20 for the box jump over 




 i have no clue what IM2 is doing in game one..the duo left 1 golem and 1 wraith at jungle start in their own jungle 




 i'm getting a not available on that link 




 What's not shown in this video is Monte explaining that shyv likes to itemize ninja tabi first vs renekton. Also by starting cloth+5pots the shyv has more jungling potential in case of a lane swap so she doesn't fall far behind. 




 whatever happened to LPL being broadcast in english..we should fix that first 




 m+w+f have 15 min warmup, 20-30 min strength workout, shorter conditioning wod 12 mins

t-r are the longer wods usually time capped around 20-25 minutes.

also offers a strength specific class m, t, r, f for those just interested in focused lifting  




 just my opinion. but whatever number you pick to break sets into..lower it. I did 7 on my first set of thrusters thinking i'd break everything into 3rds...i had to do sets of 3 from there on out..i think if I had done 5 i could have kept a stronger pace. also on the burpees find a nice pace you can keep the entire time. you should be able to do them unbroken 




 both cars i've seen ads for 0% for the first 3 years. Given the state of my finances I could realistic have either payed off in that time. 

I think i started responding before your edit.  What are the reason to go for a 2011 bmw vs the mazda/scion?

 




 around here its hard to get used cars with 0% apr. dont bmw/audi's have high upkeep/maintenance costs?



 




 if only they were in my price range T.T 




 yeah a sporty sedan. I'm 26 and I make a decent amount of money..so I want a car that looks good..but I dont want to be a pretentious douche. I dont really like trucks/suvs either 




 So i've been driving a used 2000 Ford Taurus for the past 8 years and put over 170k miles on it. Today it finally bit the dust so I'm looking for a new car. 

If I can get a deal with 0% APR i would prefer new

My price range is $30k
I prefer automatic transmissions

I've driven a Dodge Challenger and didnt like the handling, a hyundai Sonata which was much like my taurus

Currently my top options are Mazda6, Scion FR-S 




 no doubt. i just dont believe the stated "i forgot" reason when he had a tweet about it going on 




 i'm gonna say joking:

https://twitter.com/Matt1Chan/status/439867378688483328 




 the only channel i consistently watch is ongamenet..and i subscribe to that channel so still no ads lol everything else is me flipping around 




 i would do this except twitch prerolls ads on ALL channels 




 we use them as lighter replacements for kettle bells for some beginners, or for 1 armed hang power cleans or 1 armed hang power snatch, farmer walks.. 




 its the entire east coast..there was a thread near the top 2 day ish ago about it
 




 i was doing cleans and was really focusing on keeping my elbows up by pushing the weight into my throat more...i end up cleaning the 135lbs straight into my neck...ended up with a bruise that looked a lot like a hickey 




 since i'm not at high level(silver 5), should i then not worry about this all in since my adc may not be comfortable fast shoving etc? 




 see title. right now i am starting gp10 item + 4 red pots or if i feel really confident in the lane 2 red pots and 1 ward. When/why should i take dorans shield over gp10? 




 I'm in bronze 1 and got match up against someone who was diamond last season. T.T 




 because this way i gather enjoyment from both

edit: to clarify. if i watch the show first, the book becomes supplemental material that i still enjoy..where as reading the books would probably make me despise the show. 




 thank you! 




 i want to keep the show as first exposure bc i find when i read books before seeing shows, i am inevitably disappointed(ie lord of the rings/hobbit) 




 I just finished Clash of Kings today, assuming i wish to use the tv show as my first exposure, am I safe to read ASOS? i have seen all tv episodes to date 




 Also you are delusional if you think you can bar a barbell + weights for 300 bucks...heck just a nice working set of dumbbells will cost $600 




 i'm so jealous of those prices... mine is $145 a month... 




 what is your definition of "dive in"? should do multiple sessions per a day 5 days a week? probably not. First thing you should do is find a box near you that provides an onramp program(aka a training program), this will introduce you to crossfit movements at a lower level of intensity with more focus on form(the one at my gym last 6 sessions effectively 2 weeks)

Then start with 3 days a week and see how you feel. My first month the only thing i lifted during WODs was the 15 lb training bar to get my form down..now i'm 7 months in and I did 55 reps of deadlifts at 155lb today. 




 i have a sub, video isn't playing 




 No links from r/LolEventVODs are loading for me and today's OGN match wont play either 




 i know this is a rule in OGN...is it being applied in LCS? 




 Speaking of which...I'm absolutely shocked at the lack of vayne play..with every game going late and her being a natural counter to the big tanks meta it would seem a natural pick 




 If a tie occurs, a best of 1 match is played at a later date(essentially making the series between the teams a best of 3) 




 i giggled like a school girl..which is slightly embarrassing for a 25 yr old lol 




 i will laugh out loud if they dont show and get disqualified
