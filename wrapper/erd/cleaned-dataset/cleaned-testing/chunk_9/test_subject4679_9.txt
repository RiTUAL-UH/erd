 After this week's eleven, there will be only 20 states left that ban same-sex marriage. That makes it a horserace! Who do you think will win the honour of being the final, most backward state in the USA? 
























 In my work with depressed people, I'm also struck by a disconnect between anticipatory emotion (do you look forward to doing something, like going out) and retrospective emotion (are you glad you did it). 

For example, most of us dread the thought of doing taxes, but are glad when we've finished them. We might also drag our feet organizing an event with friends, but enjoy it when it happens and feel happy we did it.

Problems often arise when people live their lives according to their temptations (how they feel in advance) as opposed to how they will feel afterward. They often feel their lives are going well when they choose activities based on satisfaction rather than temptation.

Are the elements of a hiki life genuinely more satisfying than being out in the world, or only more tempting but ultimately unsatisfying? 




 In Welcome to the NHK, an anime series about hikikomori, Sato at one point asks "Why does someone become hikikomori" and answers himself "Because he can." In other words, it is the fact that his family provides him money and makes it possible. When the money runs out, it becomes necessary to get out in the world and stop being one. To what extent do you feel this is true?
