 Rats! I'm looking for something exactly like that. And for a buck too! Nice diy by the way. 









 The city opened up the side panel and was using it as a power source for lights on one of the Lief Ericson Tunnels after Sandy knocked out the power box there. 




 BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 



















 I know the Fire House is close and they used the boxes power for construction recently but when the city was done they removed the alarm panel and left it open. It's been this way ever since. Kinda sad. 









 I know the Fire House is close but this was one of the last Fire Alarm Boxes in the neighborhood and they used the boxes power for construction recently but when they were done they removed the alarm button panel and left the box open. It's been this way ever since. 



















 Obama should be laying fiber optic cable like Eisenhower laid highways.

 Yea I saw that too but if you look again he jumps up when the truck comes around again. I think the first time he was going for a lawsuit but when the truck came around right at him he just popped right back up. 
























 OK I'm going! 





























 My thinking also. Just like what this guy did http://www.odditycentral.com/pics/california-water-tower-is-actually-a-beautiful-3-storey-house.html

If he's a Chef that deals with food getting him something like this may inspire him to try baking bread as a new interest/hobby. I know I would love something like this, hint to the wife! ;)

 Especially high end restaurants have a lot. When I was going to school I interned at a high end restaurant in Brooklyn and I worked along side students from Peter Klump, The Culinary Institute of America and The New York Restaurant School. When the chef found out I had line experience he used me to replace the guy working the pasta station for one night a week. The other interns then on hated me because they were still chopping onions, scaling fish and doing all the other prep work that a restaurant needs for a dinner service. If you want everyone to love you you can never survive a professional kitchen. 




 Glad I could help. BTW what did you spend the money on? 














 Ouch, I'm sorry. I did Karmadecay it before I posted it. 




 Yea me too!

 Everyday there is some version of this going on on some subway line or platform. The performers you see in places like Times Square actually have to perform their act to be approved by the city before they are allowed to perform in public. There's a guy who plays a piano on the platform, he gets the piano down by using the Handicapped elevator.

 I was working for a small bus company in NYC, tours, airport transfers things like that. My boss was a good guy and a lot of his contacts were through friends of his so we were always getting really nice clients and jobs. I was waiting for a group to come out of the Natural History Museum when I spot Jerry Seinfeld cooling down after a run in Central Park right next to my bus. I told him I was a big fan and asked for an autograph and he just gave me the haughtiest look I have ever been given in my life, he snorts and just walks away rolling his eyes. Seinfeld hadn't been on for long and I remember him begging to get on Stern when he was working the tri state area, that's when I found out his distaste for giving autographs to the point he even included it in his American Express commercials years later. Whatever, right? Fast forward a few years and Seinfeld is bigger than ever and I'm driving around the UWS giving a night tour to this group really nice group from Alabama, they could not have been more friendlier if they tried. Well I pull up to a light and I spot Seinfeld talking with a friend at his corner, he's looking for a cab and I remember the snub from before so I get on the speaker, point him out and then opened the door right in front of him and in about a minute he was surrounded. The look on his face, PRICELESS! 









 I almost stepped into the path of an oncoming bus yesterday while answering a call from my wife. I wondered if she would have heard the hit? 







































 Damm! Straight outta Melbourne is a great title. 
























 Why didn't anyone call the police and animal control on this stupid woman? Oh and from past experience grabbing and pulling both rear legs of a pit will usually make them drop whats in their mouth. This is why pit bulls should be banned in cities. Their "great family pets" until that the one time they are not. 

















































 Why do I look at this subreddit when all I've got to eat for dinner is cereal? 




 You are correct! Former new Yorker living in California redid a small bathroom. I think it looks great! 









 Bam there it is!

 He probably means a lot of hours, even as an unpaid intern your expected to do a 10 to 14 hour shift, depending if your also prepping the lunch or dinner service. I'm sorry but if you took a job without asking how much your going to be paid then, my friend you are going to be very unpleasantly surprised. BTW which place are you going to be slaving/working in in Williamsburg?   












































 I don't know about that but I posted the Hot Pepper challenge Gordon Ramsay video because I think that woman is insane! 









 On a stick! 




 It's called Great escapes with Gordon Ramsay. His version of Anthony Bourdain's show.
