 I'm guessing its an extended cameo then.  














 why not get the arkham knight bundle? 




 Doesnt really answer the question though. the texture pop in is what made it unplayable for me.  









 Is this subreddit gonna do a season 8 re-watch before season 9 premieres? 









 Book 6....Keep dreaming.  




 No. I hate this game with a passion.  




 That are not part of their main phases sort of like star wars anthology movies? 




 if your not going to watch it all dont bother. Every episode is essential to the plot. If you skip one you'll miss something important and it just wont make sense. 




 i think OP is talking about the movie Max with the dog.  









 yea but marvel seems to want people to think that the incredible hulk never happened :( 









 that tweet sounded like the person wasn't a marvel fan tho and just mocked the name ant-man.  




 I mean what other villains besides Loki have returned for more than one movie in the MCU? I really want YellowJacket to survive Ant-Man. Been a bit annoyed that Red Skull hasn't made a come back yet.  









 All of us need to see this movie to show marvel we want more new characters.  Marvel will be watching this one closely to see how it performs.  









 english version ftw.  




 Or will they just go **** it and keep moving forward? 




 Geek0id 3 cause you ain't geek0id.  









 stupid article is stupid. what major update? did I miss something? 




 Stop making shit up.  














 A lot of people are expecting it flop or fall below expectations. I think when a movie, especially one like ant-man defies all expectations id consider it a sleeper hit.  




 There are some streaming websites in countries like korea that get exclusive streaming rights a month or so after the cinema release state side. People then use a piece of software to rip the video from their servers.  




 What when? 




 Hank Pym should task Scott Lang to steal one of Stark's Iron Man helmets as a test but Scott ends up doing it for shits and giggles and he ends up on the avengers radar when Jarvis captures him on a security camera and all you see is an iron man helmet on starks work bench suddenly move and fall of the table and seemingly walk out the door on its own and starks just staring at the screen with a stunned reaction. 




 LOL imagine ant-man stealing Iron Mans helmet or something just for shits and giggles.  




 Doesn't make it official unless it comes directly from Marvel.  




 you must be real fun at parties.  




 yea they reported that the amazing spider-man 3 was going to go into production turned out to be bs.  




 I know its winter but is something else going on in the environment? Its not usually this cold is it? I could barely feel my hands this morning.  









 I really want to know what happened between the first avenger and winter soldier.  




 I always support the underdog and we need AMD to stick around   




 Anyone who wanted to play the master chief collection has already bought an xbox one. 

The ending of halo 4 would probably convince quite a lot of PC players to buy halo 5 and an xbox one. As a result MCC on PC would drive more sales for halo 5 and xbox one. This is something ms could use to their marketing advantage like. "play halo 4 on PC before halo 5 on xbox one with the master chief collection on pc in 1080p/60fps" idk im not a marketing guy lol just an idea. 

in the end just put the game on steam. Give it a bit of discount for having pc gamers wait so long and watch the money flow in. Everybody wins. 

 














 Amazon has showed interest in show in the past so tweet them as well.  









 You think thats bad? I live in New Zealand and Liriks streams start at around 4am and I get up at 4:30am. And they usually finish when I get home around mid day. So I hardly ever get to watch live except weekends.  




 its already aired and its been more than a few weeks since the finale. Id say its fair game.  




 yea they had to cancel their suicide squad plans with Harley Quinn once the movie was announced.  









 it said play it first on playstation. They didn't say it was exclusive. Play it first usually means its a timed exclusive.  




 The russo brothers are directing both so it doesn't matter.  









 the beauty of plot armor.  




 They know their audience 




 that would be pretty awesome.  




 we also need gears of war 2 and 3.  




 Man your an idiot.  




 Honestly I wouldn't care. They have to make money back somehow and if its through xbox live on PC ill take it. I just want halo on PC.  




 I call bullshit. If we have learned anything about the production leading up to this movie its that the studio hates leaks and spoilers. Other newsoutlets are also probably mad they didn't get this scoop so their trying to make people think its fake and are working with Disney to disprove this.  









 Thor: Ragnarok when it was announced Feige compared it to the winter solder in phase 2. Ragnarok will be the big game change in phase 3.  
























 Daniel Craig has one movie left after Spectre and it looks like casting could already be underway for his replacement. Lots of rumors over the last 24 hours include Damian Lewis as the potential new bond. Who do you think should take his place? 









 maybe hes a pro cod player and has to have the platform that gets the DLC first? 









 But you would'nt steal a car? 









 Thats true. Something like a 750ti will do you nicely. its small and uses hardly any power. Yet it has more graphics power than the ps4 and xbox one.  




 get a better graphics card and you'll be sweet.  




 well fallout 4 has been in development since fallout 3 came out. so its further along than Doom.  




 As will Tomb Raider and Battlefront. Battlefront cant get delayed cause Disney wants it out the same time as the force awakens and Tomb Raider has a licensing deal that will expire so MS will want take advantage of it.  




 Can we just stop and think about this for a minute. This movie made more money in one WEEKEND than some movies do in their LIFETIME. HOLY SHIT.  




 The First Avenger was alright. The only thing I didn't like were the scenes where cap had to get all patriotic and suck up to his superiors so he could be in the army. 




 Who else is taking the day off just to watch the show live? 




 I remember reading an article from Forbes where they said that agents of shield being renewed for season 3 pretty much meant that tis longevity was virtually confrmed now and that ABC would see it as a viable asset in the future because it got past a certain number of episodes or something. 

How much of a role would the show being involved with marvel have influenced ABCs decision on whether or not to renew or cancel future seasons? 




 With news that sony and marvel might be arguing over who the next spider-man should be it's got me a bit worried. I've been trying to think if there's anything Sony could do to possibly back out of the deal with Marvel if Sony doesn't like working with Marvel.

One would assume that Marvel/Disney aren't that stupid and they would of had their lawyers double and triple check the contract before signing it to make sure Sony couldn't find away to back out. But I'm curious if there is? Any lawyers here familiar with things like this? Would Sony be able to make a case if they don't like working with marvel and cant decide on a spider-man and want to back out of the deal. could they? 




 we already have inhumans being the substitute for x-men in the MCU now anyway. marvel doesn't need them.  




 One example I use quite often is Chris Evans in Danny Boyle's movie sunshine. such humble beginnings for an actor who would later become such a huge star. Another one is RDJ in Zodiac in 2007 before he played  Iron Man in 2008.  




 Due to TMNT2? Anyone know when filming wraps for TMNT2 and when filming for arrow commences?  




 well to me it seems like the studio has no idea wtf is going on. One day apparently bay isn't directing a week later he is then hes not. its a never ending cycle of will bay direct or not.  
























 Remember the marvel event last October? Feige said that anything that wasn't announced then was ether stll in development or just pure rumor and speculation. He was asked about Benedict Cumberbatch at the time and basically said his casting was still in negotiations and unfortunately he wasn't cast till about a month or to after the event. Feige apparently had his phone ready and waiting for the call to announce Cumberbatch at the event but these things take time. Especially when dealing with such young actors their probably nervous about signing on to such a strict contract like this.  




 They need to take their time. Marvel and sony cant afford to screw up this casting. They want this new spider-man to be the wolverine of the MCU. So whoever they cast needs to be commited and wont try and walk out on the role when the going gets tough or when they get older and want to try other things.  




 Not unless you want your jacket and whatever is in the jackets pockets to get stolen sure.  




 But I liked that movie :( 









 rage much. its an old game deal with it.  




 No it hasn't been confirmed. There has been no announcement by marvel on that one.  




 Some updates require other updates to be able to install. its normal.  














 The soundtrack for the first amazing spider-man was brilliant. I don't think James Horner gets enough credit for this. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVDrTLHZEVQ 




 Fallout 4 is coming to ps4 as well.  









 I think ill be sticking with my 970 for a while. Maybe till the GTX1100 series. what about you guys? when do you decide to upgrade? 




 With no comic con appearance this year by marvel studios could we get a spider-man announcement at D23 along with a civil war teaser? 




 pretty sure thats fake.  




 Been out of the loop for a while. Has there been any info on what the next game will be? Pokemon Z or X2 and Y2? 




 even so. hes a dragon. Sons of the Harpy should of been no match for him.  




 What were they thinking? How dare Drogon almost die like that, that was bullshit! HES A DRAGON he should burned them all. The amount of bullshit during that scene was incredible. 




 it was in game glitches. like flashing colors in assassins creed unity. strange textures in saints row the third etc.  




 Remember to wipe all previous traces of any previous drivers. I learned the hard way after suffering graphical glitches for 3 months on my new 970 only to figure out it was a driver issue and not the gpu.  




 you were talking about the cat right? XD 




 LOL christain bale would kick your ass.  




 Do we really think hes actually done with the role after 2017? Like isn't his contract running out soon? Hes probably negotiating with FOX to see how long they'll wait before they give in and drive a truck full of money up to his door step. Yea Ill believe it when I see it.  









 This is the final trailer its the labeled incorrectly.  




 It probably takes just as long to install from the disc as it would to download. So why not just buy the game digitally? I remember getting the master chief collection and despite having the disc the game ended up downloading stuff anyway. so whats the point of a physical copy? 




 I call bullshit. Marvel must be feeding them false information.  




 Probably stuff for windows 10.  




 How pissed off would you be? Do you think HBO could get away with it? would they risk cutting off some viewers of the show for a chance at making some money? 




 The first one that comes to mind is a scene from Pearl Harbor. Cant remember exactly when it happens in the movie but there's a pretty obvious scene where you can see green screen in the cockpit of an aircraft.  




 skyrim was announced at e3 2011. came out in november in that year.  









 duel.  




 Please for the love of god dont buy hp!  




 its not actually the actors themselves its just Feige sitting there in his office going hmmm what would Jamie post today and then hes like wait #itsallconnected so he posts to the thor twitter lol 




 You should of waited! why buy now when the 390x is around the corner? 









 its been clear for a while now they no longer care about the books. So why not jump the shark and have a bit fun with it? 




 Or John dies saving everyone.  




 Instead of bringing back Catelyn as lady stoneheart they should bring back Ned stark. Minds would be blown. Fans would love it and hate it.  









 sort of like the halo 4 announcement back in 2011? 




 Its xbox exclusive for Holiday 2015. Not for ever.  




 Anyone heard anything if they will be present? or is it still too early? 




 who would he be and why? 




 I'm just curious to find out why and how many people use a pirated OS. Lets not turn this into a thread of whats right and wrong.

Strawpoll. Because I can.  

http://strawpoll.me/4527342 









 Thought id make a strawpoll for this one. 
http://strawpoll.me/4527046/

I think Ant-Man will do better mostly because of its connection to the MCU. Mean while FF has already had two bad movies under its belt and people haven't forgotten those so they may not be as willing to give this reboot a chance.  









 I think marvel has big plans for Hydra and their only getting started and that paticular line in winter soldier only enforces this theory.  




 Anyone know if hes working on anything? 




 http://screenrant.com/marvel-studios-movies-tv-shows-rivalry-joss-whedon/ 




 Poor Gregg. Its shame theres so much conflict between Tv Marvel and movie Marvel.  I reckon Renner was going to appear on Shield but something happened behind the scenes to prevent it.  




 even if they did that you could just roll back the driver so it would be stupid for NVIDIA to even try something like that. It would just piss people off.  




 All that's needed now is for 4k monitors to drop to an affordable mainstream price.  




 I'm guessing it doesn't show up unless you have updates enabled?  




 why would they put him in Doctor Strange though? it doesn't make sense. That's the only other marvel movie he could appear in.  




 Got some sauce for that? 




 He didn't retire.So many of you misunderstood the end of Iron Man 3. He destroyed his suits for pepper but he never stopped being Iron Man. Thats why it was called the clean slate protocol. He wanted a fresh start and to forget the past. He even said before the credits rolled  "You can take away everything from me but there's one thing you can't take away I'm Iron Man" 




 1. Spider-Man must not have a big role in Civil War and they are filming around his scenes until they cast someone

2.Negotiations with Asa Butterfield are taking longer than expected and marvel and sony are getting nervous so they are looking at alternatives in case negations fail. 

just some food for thought.  














 imagine a launch at e3. hype. but seriously. it will be out holiday 2015.  




 Hopefully they will premiere the first 2 episodes on the same day like alot of new shows do.  




 YES! I was hoping someone would bring this up. I can totally see this replacing person of interest for me if season 5 is the final season. The pilot was so good! 




 make sure to set power management in windows to high performance. sometimes being on power saver or balanced can cause lag.  














 Not sure if its just me but the graphics in episode 4 seems rushed, especially during the previously on game of thrones intro it looks kind of pixelated in the background and in general looks worse compared to the previous episodes.  




 wtf. 









 I thought it was happening? Haven't heard anything in a long time though.  




 they are hardware developers not software developers . 




 380x is a rebranded 290x.  














 In light of Tron 3 getting canned lets talk about Tron: Legacy. What did you like about it? what did you hate? what could they have improved on in the sequel? Lets get a good discussion going! 




 id be ok with it. its better than not having the game not released at all. it means at least some people get to enjoy it.  









 I've seen July mentioned a few times haven't seen anything official though.  




 well the movie has been out for a while now and I'm sure most of us have seen it at least a couple of times to decide. Is it better than the first movie?  









 Totally agree. I have always said the consoles need to put FPS over resolution. A higher frame rate just makes the game that much more enjoyable when your not noticing stutter or clipping when moving around. It doesn't make sense to have the game running at 1080p when the hardware clearly cant handle it.  




 I think there needs to be a time jump in season 4. Have season 4 take place 1 or 2 years post season 3. That way they can get as far away from it as possible. Have Oliver and Felicity develop a proper relationship during that time off screen so we don't need to see her cry every time Oliver does something she doesn't approve of and they wont have to mention anything that happened in season 3 ether except for maybe Saras death then they can jump straight into the action in season 4. Have some devastating event that causes Oliver to come out of retirement and return to starling city and bam just like that you got season 4 the rest is up to the writers on what story they have planned hopefully its something awesome.

 I loved this movie when I was younger. Thought the 3d was awesome.  




 Alternate universe? different earth? there are plenty of ways they could pull it off.  




 Can you imagine if they do a post credit scene where grunt gustin shows up and tells Ezra Millers flash that he isn't the only flash in the universe. OMG 2 barry allen's waaaaattttt 




 Wednesday usually meant a new episode of the flash for me. But not today and no Agents of Shield ether. Me sad :( 









 what if thanos in the mcu has the ability to take the form of a human and disguise himself? 




 Haven't overclocked it. still on stock clocks.  




 I hope its just that. All my other games seem to run fine. And its only this particular level on the game where this glitch happens. All the other levels appear to be fine.  




 Heres another one where the glitch is more visible. http://i.imgur.com/ryb5UQK.jpg?1 









 So the writers finally found a way to freshen up the show at the end of season 3 but fox had to ruin it and cancel it. Anyone heard if another network might pick it up? 














 gta 5 




 I got a kick out of those, some of them were really good.Why did they stop?  




 Actually 2015 is looking like a big year for E3. This is the first year they are doing a PC conference put together by AMD and various other developers and manufacturers. Its looking pretty solid imo.  














 Hey Niko! 




 Most gamers seem to stick to the 240-250gb SSD for their os then a 1tb or bigger hard drive for game storage. Does anyone actually get 1tb ssds for their os and games? 









 Why do people get so hyped for this? who wants to watch a movie without audio? and in black and white?
