 My basement. During the day, I just see it as the lower part of my house. But at night, it may as well be the opening to the worst circle of hell! 




 When people think I'm a slacker just because I smoke weed. I'm not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but I finished my first year of college with all A's - albeit a few were A minuses - and have always worked hard to stay on top of my life's various workloads like job tasks, household chores, and responding promptly to both professional and casual messages. Bonus exasperation points if the person who is lecturing me is a person with poor work ethic but thinks s/he is superior because s/he doesn't smoke. 




 There is a huge difference between being a caring, empathetic person and a pushover, however.
