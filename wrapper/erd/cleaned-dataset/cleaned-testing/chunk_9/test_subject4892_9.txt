 Yep. I'm definitely not insinuating that this was the greatest 3 year stretch in history haha, but it's still pretty I think, nonetheless. 




 ~~That's.... more difficult to find~~. FSU is at 92.86% for that stretch, some others:  
**1954-56 Oklahoma went 31-0, 100%**  
2003-05 USC went 35-2, 94.59%  
1977-1979 Bama went 34-2 94.44%  
1993-95 Nebraska went 36-1, 97.30%  

And I'm sure I'm missing a handful of other notable ones

Other info:  
- been lifting for a couple months now and am looking to move into a more intermediate routine with higher volume.   
- I've injured my knee before doing squats (and that was after a considerable amount of form work) and am deathly afraid of attempting them again, so leg work is going to have to come from other sources.  
- I'm looking to work solely on aesthetics, and for some reason my arms just blow up in proportion to my core; so I think one iso exercise for bi's/tri's should be plenty, especially considering the amount of tertiary work they're getting in major lifts. 




 I just manually traced it back. You have to average 13 wins per season to get to 39, and there were very few 13 win seasons in history before the mid-90's (Bama in 92, and BYU in 84), so I went ahead and looked up the total team histories for the 40ish most successful schools in college football history, and nobody else ever strung together 39.  









 All games of at least 32 points:

Oladipo - 38 points  
Oladipo - 35 points  
Oladipo - 33 points  
Michael Carter-Williams - 33 points  
Oladipo - 32 points  
Trey Burke - 32 points  
 




 I would like 1 Thibs please. 




 We're two months in, and hitting that point where lifting is starting to get addicting. The weights are increasing rapidly, we're getting our routine down into a groove. How are you guys sticking with it? 




 I'd go even higher - compare his career right now against Bird/Duncan/Kobe/Oscar, and he's got them beat. 

I'd go so far as to say if he retired at the end of this season there's an argument for him being as high as third all time behind Kareem/Jordan. I'd say him and Magic are neck and neck; and where he stands next to Chamberlin/Russell depend on how you value championships in 9 team leagues and stats played in games with 50% more possessions. 




  | Minutes Played | games played | Seasons 
---|--------------|------------ |---------
Lebron | 34,891 | 886 |  12
Bird | 34,443 | 897 | 13
Magic | 33,245 | 906 | 13

*All regular season stats  

Assuming Lebron plays at least 21 of the Cavs 28 remaining games he'll have passed them in career games as well. If you eliminate Birds injured 6-game season and Magic's post-retirement 32 game season, they'll all be tied at 12 as well.

It's wild to think that at this point in their careers, two all-time greats were already finished, and it feels like Lebron still has plenty of time left in his career. 




 Everyone knows promissory estoppel is not a thing, stop trying to make it a thing. 




 "Back" is the operative word there buddy. USC has lost between 4 and 6 games in 5 of their last 6 seasons; there's nothing  controversial about suggesting they haven't been elite as of late. 




 Prediction: FSU is about a 9-3 team next year, but we'll start the season ranked like 8th anyways. Because 4 of our 5 easiest games are in the first five weeks, we'll start out 4-0 and move up to like 5th or whatever and be massively overrated by the media. Then when we hit the meat of our schedule and drop 2 or 3 to GT, Clemson, Louisville, Miami, UF, or god forbid NC State; everyone will call this season a massive failure and a "collapse" and that we were frauds the whole time, and it's going to make my blood boil, because this team is set up perfectly for that narrative in the eyes of the college football world. None of my friends are going to listen to me when we're being listed as "outside playoff contenders" halfway through the season, and most of them are going to call for Jimbo to get fired or something completely ridiculous. 

I will always be a florida state fan, and I'm still incredibly glad this program is as good as it is right now, but I'm really going to not enjoy dealing with college football next year.

  




 No he's not. Bill Peterson has 62 to Jimbo's 58. 




 I think we still deserve to be ranked above Michigan State. Looking at the whole season together, we have a loss to the same team as Michigan State, but then they also have another loss - albeit to the #1 team in the country. We have three ranked wins, they have one.

All told, FSU is 3-1 against the top 25, Michigan State is 1-2. We have two more wins and one less loss (and a tougher overall SOS).

If our loss to Oregon weren't so fresh in everyone's minds this wouldn't so controversial.

 Sorry, going by seasons, not strictly by calendar years. 




 [Part 1 Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/2saki4/ranking_the_top_10_teams_of_the_decade_so_far/)  

 
**#5 Auburn**  Overall record: 45-21 (68.2%), conference championships: 2, national championships: 1  
Winning seasons: 4, 10-win seasons: 2, AP ranked finishes: 3, AP top-10 finishes: 2  
Major bowl appearances: 2, major bowl wins: 1, bowl wins: 2
 
Part of me still has no real clue where to rank this team, Auburn is truly a model of inconsistency. On the one hand you have a team with the 24th best overall record among FBS teams, only going 1-1 in major bowls, three unranked seasons, and an abysmal 3-9 year where the team was so awful they fired their head coach 2 years after he won a national championship. Yikes. On the other hand they actually won a national championship. They did so with a Heisman winning quarterback, going undefeated in the process. Thats huge. Throw in the fact that he was drafted #1 overall and you have what is basically the perfect possible season. The lone other season they finished ranked this decade they just barely lost the national championship. Three ranked seasons total, at #1 and #2 and #22. They join Oregon and Alabama as the only team to play in two national championships. Considering how hard national championships are to come by (much less, appearing in them) I cant with any good conscience put them lower than 5th. Two 8-5 years arent pretty, and 3-9 is just tragic, but theres only so much damage you can do to a crystal football.
 
**#4 Oregon**  Overall Record: 60-8 (88.23%), conference championships: 3, national championships: 0  
Winning seasons: 5, 10-win seasons: 5, AP ranked finishes: 5, AP top-10 finishes: 5  
Major bowl appearances: 4, major bowl wins: 3, bowl wins: 4
 
These poor guys. Overall best record in all of college football this decade, five straight seasons of top-10 finishes (four in the top 5), never less than 11 wins in a season, two national championship appearances and a Heisman winner to boot. They are unequivocally the best team from the PAC12 this decade and   probably no team in all of college football has been consistently as excellent as Oregon in this same timeframe. But the one number that matters more than anything is the only blemish they have: zero national championships. Listen, national championships are valuable, they are *the* end goal of every football team (sorry G5!) every year; the national champions are the teams that people remember, but they are not the only benchmark. Bo Schembechler never won a national championship, and Michigan fans still fellate his legacy 30 years later. When you do just about everything on earth for five straight years except win a national championship, you still have an era worth talking about. Its why I think there is actually a pretty large gap between Auburn and Oregon here, and why the gap between Oregon and the teams above it are incredibly small (these top four are really in a tier of their own).  Make no mistake, this decade still has all the makings of a mini-dynasty.
 
**#3 Ohio State** - Overall record: 55-11 (83.33%), conference championships: 1, national championships: 1  
Winning seasons: 4, 10-win seasons: 4, AP ranked finishes: 4, AP top-10 finishes: 3  
Major Bowl appearances: 3, major bowl wins: 2, bowl wins: 2
 
Ohio State finished on what you could call a high note with that drubbing of Wisconsin, the sugar bowl win over Bama, and the belated-rose-bowl national championship win over Oregon. And yes, it hasnt felt this good to be a buckeye since 2002, but their ridiculous decade (so far) has gone pretty wildly up and down. Starting with a 12-1 season and a Sugar Bowl win, then the shitstorm of sanctions from the NCAA, suddenly losing their historically great coach, watching Luke Fickell coach the team for a year, having their prayer answered with Urban going back on the head coaching market, watching in turmoil as they go undefeated and are sanctioned out of the postseason, watching again as they go undefeated  only to have their dreams murdered by Michigan State, and finally ending with an overpowering third string quarterback leading them to a national championship. Truthfully, it was incredibly difficult to sort out teams 2-3-4; and especially between tOSU and the team directly above it, but Ohio State was looking at a losing season, impending sanctions, and Luke Fickell as head coach at one point 3 years ago, Ohio State fans cant be too sad about being here.
 
**#2 Florida State**  Overall record: 58-11 (84.1%), conference championships: 3, national championships: 1  
Winning seasons: 5, 10-win seasons: 4, AP ranked finishes: 5, AP top-10 finishes: 3  
Major bowl appearances: 3, major bowl wins: 2, bowl wins: 4
 
Our lone ACC representative, this ranking fits neatly with the Jimbo Fisher era of Florida State Football (he took over as head coach in 2010) and has been one hell of a show. There was the 29 game winning streak, the 6th longest in FBS win streak of the last 100 years, the Heisman-winning walking-controversy of a quarterback, the 2013 which set all kinds of records for how lopsided their regular season wins were, then the 2014 season with probably more records for how hilariously unimpressive their regular season wins were (and how painfully they were humiliated in the playoffs). But when its all said and done, FSU never went worse than 9-4, and they have the 3rd best record in the FBS over this time frame, a Heisman winner, a national championship, consecutive seasons going into their bowl game at 13-0, three consecutive AP top-10 finishes, two Major bowl wins, and definitive ownership of the red-headed stepchild P5 conference.
 
I give Florida State the nod (trying to be impartial here) because they won three conference championships to OSUs one, their worst season was significantly less bad than OSUs (finishing 9-4, ranked v. a losing season at 6-7), Ohio State went through NCAA sanctions and have had three head coaches in these five years (both of which I think of as a sort of intangible negatives), Florida State has the Heisman winner, and Florida State has the better overall record. Again, if someone wanted to argue that OSU should be number 2 strictly because OSU had four great years to FSUs three, I would be totally fine with it. But I do think Florida State gets the edge. 
 
**#1 Alabama** - Overall record: 58-9 (86.57%), conference championships: 2, national championships: 2,   
winning seasons: 5, 10-win seasons: 5, AP ranked finishes: 5, AP top-10 finishes: 5,  
Major Bowl appearances: 4, Major bowl wins: 2, bowl wins: 3
 
I guess Ill start by trying to poke holes in Alabamas otherworldly dominance of the college football scene: theyve now lost consecutive bowl games and are now tied with Missouri for two SEC championship game appearances in the last five years. On the upside, Alabama has been unequivocally the greatest college football team in the nation so far this decade. You could start and finish the discussion with two national championships and be done with it, or then think that if a field goal had 5 more yards on it they'd have been in a third, and then shown some fourth quarter heroics against tOSU they could be in four straight right now. Even going beyond that, it's the five straight top-10 finishes, and four straight top-7 finishes. Consistently having one of the best defenses in the nation. Consistently leading all teams in both recruit AND sending kids to the NFL. There's a lot more to gush about, but I'll keep it brief because there's not much I need to convince anyone of here. Alabama is heads and tails above the rest as the best team of the last half-decade. 




 This is really starting to get infuriating. All five underclassman that had any type of draft value left this year. We were going to return 14 starters and a really experienced D that could compensate for our inexperienced O, now we have neither. 

Our ceiling might really be 9-3 next year. 




 Now that were halfway through, I decided to compile a ranking of the top-10 college football teams of the decade so far. The actual criteria is a totally subjective throw it all in a pot analysis, but the most important factors are obvious: championships are by far the most important criteria, overall record, conference championships, major bowl wins, and final AP rankings (Im using AP because theyre generally the consensus postseason ranking) are all very important too. So without further ado: 

The Honorable Mentions  It was really hard to leave all of these teams off, and I wouldnt really disagree with someone arguing any one of these teams deserves to be at #10, but tough decisions have to be made. **Wisconsin** has three B1G championships to its name so far this decade, three 11-win seasons, three major bowl appearances, and two top-10 finishes; but three consecutive rose bowl losses (1-4 overall in bowls) just barely keeps them out. **Clemson** had four consecutive 10-win seasons, 2 AP top-10 finishes, went 1-1 in major bowl games, and a conference championship to boot, but it wasnt enough to overcome the losing season in 2010 that keeps them out. **Oklahoma State** had one crazy good year culminating in a major bowl win, and two other solid 10-win seasons, but it wasnt enough to overcome two mediocre unranked seasons that keep them out. **South Carolina** (poor Spurrier) had four consecutive ranked seasons, three in a row going 11-2 and finishing the season ranked in the top 10, and would most assuredly be on this list if they had hit 10 wins again this year; but they got SEC murdered with only one division title, no conference championships, and no major bowl invitations (RIP two-team-per-conference rule) these five years which keeps them out. **Boise State** went 11-2 or better four times, won their conference three times, finished in the top 10 twice, and finished with the 5th best record in the league through these last five years; but was really hurt by not playing in a major conference  with only one major bowl invite, and G5 conference titles being less impressive, they just barely dont make the cut.  

Now onto the list.


**#10 TCU** - Overall record: 47-17 (73.4%), conference championships: 3, national championships: 0  
Winning seasons: 4, 10-win seasons: 3, AP ranked finishes: 3, AP top-10 finishes: 2  
Major bowl appearances: 2, major bowl wins: 2, bowl wins: 3  

TCU is definitely no higher than 10th, namely because two of their three great seasons were played with Mountain West Schedules, and then went 11-14 their first two seasons in the Big 12 which gives them one of the biggest negatives of any team on this list, with those taken into account and with only the 15th best record in the FBS these past years I was tempted to leave them off. I think they still deserve to be here though because their Rose bowl win over the Badgers in 2010 put them at #2 in the final rankings with a major bowl win and an elusive undefeated 13-0 season. This year their only loss came on the road by three points due to an epic comeback by top-10 ranked Baylor. By my count thats two years where TCU was seriously in the conversation for the best team in the nation, and I value higher highs with lower lows more than consistent averages (to some extent) which is why TCU gets the nod over all the other honorable mentions.


**#9 LSU**  Overall record: 52-14 (78.8%), conference championships: 1, national championships: 0  
Winning seasons: 5, 10-win seasons: 4, AP ranked finishes: 4, AP top-10 finishes: 2  
Major bowl appearances: 1, major bowl wins: 0, bowl wins: 2  

Another team that was probably severely hindered by the brutality of the SEC in the 2010s. LSU and Oklahoma bear remarkable similarity to each other, and it was difficult to separate the two, as LSU actually got to play for a national championship game, and had a one-game better record with a probably much more difficult 5-year strength of schedule. However LSU, despite still being great this decade, has a couple of shortcomings. They managed only one major bowl appearance in five years (the national championship, no less) and lost it, and only managed one SEC championship during this time span as well. LSU has been undeniably great these past five years, but the lack of hardware makes this about as high as they can go. 


**#8 Oklahoma**  Overall record: 51-15 (77.3%), conference championships: 2, national championships: 0  
Winning seasons: 5, 10-win seasons: 4, AP ranked finishes: 4, AP top-10 finishes: 2  
Major bowl appearances: 2, major bowl wins: 2, bowl wins: 3  

Cheer up Oklahoma fans, we get that youre hungry for national relevance again, but you could be doing a lot worse. Bob Stoops is still, in fact, one of the best coaches in college football, Oklahoma can still recruit, and your future will always be bright. Your worse two-year stretch with Bob Stoops is still better than your best two-year stretch before Bob Stoops since Barry Switzer retired. Youve won both your major bowl appearances so far this decade, are still tied for the most Big 12 championships this decade, and sport the 10th best record over that same span during your decline. 


**#7 Michigan State**  Overall record: 53-14 (79.1%), conference championships: 2, national championships: 0  
Winning seasons: 5, 10-win seasons: 4, AP ranked finishes: 4, AP top-10 finishes: 2 (one more at 11)  
Major bowl appearances: 2, major bowl wins: 2, bowl wins: 4  

Mark Dantonio is a hell of a coach. Four 11 win seasons in five years is a huge feat, and going 2-0 in major bowl games isnt exactly easy either. Even with a blip 7-6 season in 2012 Michigan State is averaging 10.6 wins per year, and has the 8th best record in the FBS so far this decade (the 7 teams with better records include 5 teams ranked in front of them, Boise State, and Northern Illinois). Last year was a particularly high point for them, as the only 1-loss P-5 team in the nation, finishing the season ranked 3rd overall, and arguably the best defense in the nation. Even without Narduzzi, I expect Connor Cook to have a great senior year and Michigan state to continue racking up double-digit win seasons. This team looks like its going to keep up the recent tradition of being awesome, and I think well see, for the next half decade anyway, a holy trinity of the Spartans, Buckeyes, and Harbaughs punching it out for the B1G title.


**#6 Stanford**  Overall record: 54-13 (80.6%), conference championships: 2, national championships: 0  
Winning seasons: 5, 10-win seasons: 4, AP ranked finishes: 4, AP top-10 finishes: 3 (one more at 11)  
Major bowl appearances: 4, major bowl wins: 2, bowl wins: 3  

Stanford just had its worst season so far this decade, but when your worst season is 8-5 with a bowl win, youre either Nebraska or youre feeling pretty good about yourself. Stanford started off hot under Harbaughs final year going 13-1 and finishing the season ranked 4th overall; then under Shaw they won two consecutive conference championships and three more major bowl berths. In fact, they and Alabama are the only two teams in the NCAA since 2010 to go to four consecutive major bowl games, and theyve done it while consistently fending off one of the teams ranked ahead of them. Their overall record since 2010 is good for 7th in the FBS (5th in the P5) 

Part 2 coming later today. 




 No Jimbo Fisher :( 




 Yep, I mean Martez Ivey, Bryon Cowart, and Cece Jefferson alone are going to be *huge*. People making fun of UF are dumb. 




 I would argue Florida State is just as big of a wildcard. Jameis led the ACC in interceptions and then went 3td's, 0 interceptions against one of the best interception-forcing teams in the nation.  




 You guys have a handful of five-stars IIRC that haven't announced yet but are 95% sure of UF. I wouldn't worry about your ranking at the moment. 




 Yep, Florida State fan my whole life and those were my four years in college there :( 




 As a counterpoint to that: we didn't score a touchdown in the 2nd half of our last three games. 




 I mean, did you read the last sentence of my post? 




 Nope, FSU alum. 




 I think we're a year away from doing one of those if we ever did - they got crazy good crazy fast. We have a lot of potential, but it won't become kinetic as rapidly; I could see this core steadily improving ~5 wins a year to eventually winning 54-56 games in 5 years. 




 None taken, you're in a terrible place   time in NBA history to be "pretty good". Especially now that the Thunder are quickly climbing to grab that spot. 




 Motion denied. 




 I've also heard it used in the context of voters getting tired of voting for one person multiple times, e.g. why Karl Malone won the MVP over Michael Jordan in 97. 




 As of right now we are 9th in the east - one game behind Brooklyn and tied with Boston. I feel like Boston, Indiana and Charlotte all look comparable at best with the Magic; I don't see any of those teams passing us as an inevitability. This will be especially true if Boston decides to trade Rondo. 

The Knicks have Melo, and could always go on a random run, but right now they are 5 games behind is so I feel comfortable with our lead.

The Magic have played the most road games of any team in the league - once we start getting into long stretches of home games, and once we get Vuc and Aaron Gordon back, I suspect we'll be able to have a couple mini-runs. Beyond that, because all of our players are so young (Harris is 22, Vuc 24, Payton 20, Dipo 22, Gordon 19) we're behind in the chemistry   development curve, and have more room to improve within the season than most of the rest of the league.

All we need now is for the Brooklyn fire sale of players to go through and have them drop out, and I think we can be the team to replace them.

I'm irrationally excited for this Magic team. 




 They definitely both look like teams that could be very good for a long time. I think the ultimate litmus test is seeing how they handle down periods - again for teams like Michigan you know they're going to get back to 10-11 win seasons at some point, but if Art retires and they hire a coach who goes 6-6 three years in a row, will we really think there's an inevitable return to greatness waiting down the road for Baylor? Right now I'd say absolutely not, but there's definitely potential to change that. 




 Probably voter fatigue - but to be fair, it's not easy to tab a "best" player in such a statistically reductive position as kicker; and he did lose to a player with a better %fgm on the year. 




 See my last sentence. Obviously I want to win, but I needed an inflammatory title to offset six paragraphs of questionable pontificating. 




 Totally agree. And I think this is a point I could have elaborated on, but my post was already getting long enough. Success -- bigger/enduring fanbases -- better booster donations/team revenue -- better coaches   facilities -- more success. Rinse and repeat. It's a self perpetuating cycle, and I think Oregon (unlike Virginia Tech or Kansas State) has the ability to kickstart this cycle with Phil KNight's money. 




 In college football, as in most sports, there are certain teams that are perennial titans. The greatest football programs largely comprise an "old guard" of Notre Dame, Ohio State, Michigan, Alabama, Texas, Oklahoma, USC, and Nebraska (and some other schools to a lesser extent, like Tennessee/LSU). It seems like every year since world war II ended you can find four or five of these teams in the top-10 of any given AP poll. They are the programs with the most money, the best facilities, the largest fanbases who travel incredibly well, they get the best recruits and in turn produce the most all-Americans, and most importantly - they mop up the best coaches. Whenever a coach becomes too successful they often get hired away to other programs, making most programs a "stepping stone" to these schools. 

There are exceptions of course, Frank Beamer at Virginia Tech, and Bill Snyder and Kansas State are two obvious examples of schools enjoying sustained success under legendary coaches, but even then (and now) these schools are failing to draw continuous top recruiting classes and build state of the art facilities. I'm not sure if this is controversial - but I don't see either of these schools continuing to be powerhouses once these coaches retire. Most teams will enjoy national success temporarily, but only this aforementioned group of schools can enjoy it across decades and continue to realistically expect it indefinitely.

Dating back the last couple decades, there have really only been two schools to break into this elite tier of sustained success as a top football program: Florida and Florida State (maybe 3, depending on how you feel about Miami's future). Obviously neither school has much of a history preceding the 80's (FSU is actually ranked 77th all-time in games played), but both I believe now have all the factors in place to be nationally relevant for the forseeable future. Speaking as a Florida State fan - I take immense pride in being a part of a "newcomer" program that has broken the ranks; but I think more importantly Florida State fans have an extremely fragile psychology about their team. As recently as 2011 there were fans questioning - what if we really were a one-coach wonder? What if our run is over and we're destined to become just another program? A team like Michigan may be suffering now, but it's with the understanding that they'll return to being an elite team again, the systematic inertia of their program calls them to be elite, and I don't think anybody really questions that it's only a matter of time.

All this to say, I love the idea of breaking this "old guard". It's nothing personal (and with no offense to these teams individually) but I love the idea of fresh blood declaring *this isn't your grandpa's college football landscape*. Emerging teams are fun and exciting and keep the sport fresh. Saban's Alabama v. Meyer's Ohio State should be an exhilarating game and I'll enjoy the hell out of watching it, but this game is just a drop in the bucket in the context of these two program's histories.  

I want to see Oregon become one of these programs, because I think they can actually do it. They have the resources, they have the proximity to top recruits, and they've spent the last five years cultivating a draw as the sexy new football team in America. The fanbase will come with time, and the coaching will become self-perpetuating (hell, FSU is only one coach removed from being a school with a history similar to Nevada, Bowling Green, or WSU's). Oregon is already on track with six consecutive top-11 appearances in the AP final poll (and three in the top 5)  - but first thing's first, they really need to win a national championship or two to establish their arrival.

That's why, if Oregon beats us, I want them to go on to win the national championship. 




 Um what? Nobody considered beating UF at home some gargantuan accomplishment. Noles fans were excited to beat their biggest rival to cap off an undefeated season. You've got some vitriol issues I think. 




 Also, we're fun to watch :( 




 How am I being defensive? I love watching rivals suffer, as should any other fan in all of college football. 




 Our offensive line, running backs, and offense as a whole are much better than they were in 2012. 




 I'm not sure having all five conference champions actually worthy of a playoff spot is a great idea. If an 8-4 team upsets an 11-1 team in the conference championship, do you think the 9-4 conference champion is really the more deserving team to be in the playoffs? It also seems like it would encourage schools to schedule 4 OOC creampuffs to make the conference games easier to deal with, since making it to the conference championship game becomes infinitely more important. I'm happy that the committee places a huge emphasis on winning your conference, but I'm not sure making the champion an auto-qualifier is going to be a more fair way to determine who goes. 









 How so?

Edit: I did mistype 2011 for 2001 originally, apologies. 




 - three coaches in the playoffs - Jimbo, Meyer, and Saban - have won 6 of the last 8 national championships. Oregon played in a 7th with Helfrich as OC.

- if Washington's Chris Peterson loses his bowl game, the winner of Oregon/FSU will have the coach with the highest career win % of the entire FBS

-  Florida State was ranked in the AP top-10 six consecutive times leading into it's first national championship season in 1993. Oregon has done it 6 times in a row now leading up to this year.

- in fact, none of these 4 teams has been ranked in a final AP lower than 12th since 2011. 




 It is a hard metric in the sense that it's objective and not subject to opinion. Also I said it keeps them "in check", not that it is the end-all-be-all. I do agree with your last point, for sure. 




 I want to see FSU get moved to #5 next week, dominate a major bowl, and be crowned the AP national champs resulting in a split championship, literally ruining the very purpose the playoffs exist its very first year. 




 I think, honestly, us being guaranteed to be in the playoffs is a reality that we all *want* to believe is true, because the alternative seems so absurd on its face. Lord knows I do. But the committee has given absolutely no indication that being undefeated, even being the defending national champions, is dispositive of any guarantees. They've shown that occasionally looking dominant is more important than simple win-loss record, and if Baylor looks incredibly dominant against Kansas State - something FSU may fail to do in all 13 games this season - it seems consistent with their logic that FSU very well could be left out. 




 I do think we're better than TCU and Baylor. Just because you say we aren't doesn't mean we aren't. We actually have a hard metric to keep random opinions based on amorphous criteria and unreliable impressions in check, it's called a win-loss record. 




 Yeah, and a week ago everyone said #3 was our floor. 




 I like how you didn't use the final AP poll, because Florida State is in it. 




 Ooh, didn't realize that. Thanks. 









 TCU doesn't have more wins over teams .500 and above though...  




 But who knows how good McNeese State was at that point?? Prior years don't matter remember. 




 I appreciated this and I'm sad you're getting downvoted. 




 I like it. We know which fans actually have their priorities straight. If Georgia, a team that we've been cool with in the past, is rooting for Georgia Tech to beat us, we know they're not very good Georgia fans and can disregard their opinions accordingly. 




 err sorry, I meant to say finish the regular season undefeated. 




 It's funny, because Tom Osborne won 25 in a row, and his '93 Huskers were the last P5 team to go 12-0 and still be ranked #2 in the AP poll... behind 11-1 Florida State.

 pls 




 I hope you feel the tag in your shirt tomorrow.

All.

Day.

Long. 




 I hope your cereal is fresh but when you get to the fridge you're out of milk. 




 I hope he does miserably bad. 




 I mean, they're obviously not remotely the same caliber, but they're both teams that rely heavily on cut blocking and misdirection in their rushing plays, no? Those are both relatively unusual tactics that defenses don't normally face and thus one of the bigger advantages triple option teams have. 




 Florida state for a couple reasons

- FSU has had 7 opponents coming off of a bye week or an FCS opponent this year. Georgia Tech just finished an exhausting win over their biggest rival. I think GT's ability to "bring it" will be less than the average school FSU faces and less than Georgia Tech has in weeks past.

- Georgia Tech's pass defense isn't very good. I think Jameis looked awful this week, and he hasn't gone crazy against teams with really good passing D, but against Georgia Tech I expect him to get back to his usual elite self, and with FSU's new-and-improved offensive line, I think they're going to rack up a ton of points.

- Florida State has already played a triple option team this year (Citadel), so Georgia tech won't have as much an element of surprise because this defense has already had practice and game time devoted to stopping the triple option. 




 Yeah, I mean looking at Pellini's tenure, Nebraska has probably been the 16th-17th most successful team in the NCAA for W-L, but no conference championships in 7 years, and not a single top-13 final ranking. I'm actually in the minority hear thinking Nebraska can probably do better. 




 1. That's not true, you've had 12 since Solich took over

2. To be fair, Osborne didn't have ANY seasons with less than 3 losses in his career starting in 1973. So it doesn't really disprove the people saying "you can't expect a Tom Osborne all the time!" wrong.

3. With that said, I do kindof agree with you. I think they're looking for - at worst - a Lloyd Carr/Bob Stoops level coach; one that can at least maintain their all-time-great status.  




 Et tu, AP? 




 Yep, and then I would probably put Miles, Helfrich, Shaw, Stoops, Dantonio, and Spurrier in a class below that. 




 For starters, that poll above is a bit ridiculous. You guys, I imagine will be 12th or 11th, and Clemson will be 19th or 20th. The committee has shown that losing to teams ranked at the very top does not hurt you nearly as much as your average poll does, so I think no matter what you'll be in front of Clemson and Louisville. 




 But if you guys kick Wisconsin's ass with your backup... I think it gets hard again. 




 Auburn, you got inside Alabama's 10 six times this game without a touchdown, and it broke my heart. 




  I'm sick of getting every teams best fucking effort

tell me about it 




 Well spoken. Analogies to prior year teams as a dismissive or supportive argument for Florida State are ridiculous. 

We are a wholly unique entity in college football history. A Heisman winning quarterback that could drag us to victory against an elite team, or throw three consecutive interceptions in his own territory; an offensive line that could get manhandled or provide holes a freighter truck can fit through; WR's that could drop passes/run terrible routes leading to INT's, or burn an elite CB for a 50 yard TD bomb. Nobody knows what we are. I've followed this team obsessively and I have no clue what they are. It's miraculous that Jimbo has managed to bring it all together for 12 games without a loss, and we deserve credit for that; but absolutely nothing surprises me about this team week to week. 




 You're kidding.... right? 




 Auburn also got trounced in a regular season game. 




 I'm okay with that. 




 With two losses to unranked teams? I'm not really sure about that. It would depend on how much value the committee puts into conference championships. 




 PREPARE TO GET MURDERED ^BY ^^THREE ^^^POINTS 




 Next year it'll be 2 or 3 teams huddled together in the corner pretending the rest of the conference doesn't exist. 




 That doesn't make any sense. 




 With MSU dropping, all it would take is a Baylor loss to KSU and a JT Barret-less OSU loss to Wisconsin and we're in no matter what. 




 SEC West is like the Roman empire in 284 A.D., the whole thing used to be great, but now they're lopping off the half they don't want and refusing to associate with it. 




 Congrats to Georgia Tech. No matter what happens next Saturday they're going to the Orange bowl! 




 FSU grad here what does splenetic mean? 




 r u mad? 




 No way man, we're like 2-0 this year when up at the half. 




 this is what we like to call "getting comfortable" 




 Still haven't gone to bed :/ 




 For instance, Georgia Tech should be rooting for us, because if we both win this weekend they're guaranteed a trip to the Orange bowl.  

UGA fans should be rooting for us because we both like to watch UF suffer.

Oregon fans should probably be rooting for us because they'll probably want to play us in the rose bowl over TCU/OSU/Baylor/Miss. St. 




 He's also wrong. Florida has a winning record, and will at worst go 6-5. 




 They've taken 20 more shots than we have... argh. 




 They're outrebounding us 27-12 as of right now :( 




 I don't know where all these downvotes are coming from? Oladipo is our shooting guard of the future through-and-through. We traded up to get Elf for a reason... because we needed a point guard. Dipo is great at playing off the ball and will absolutely not be a long term primary ball handler. 




 Alternative chaos:

Oregon beats Arizona/Bama wins SEC/TCU wins out locking in 3 playoff spots.  
Miss St. loses the egg bowl   
Georgia Tech beats Georgia  
FSU loses to UF.  

FSU looks done, but wait!  
Baylor loses to Kansas State  
Ohio State loses to Wisconsin  
FSU beats now #12 ranked Georgia Tech.

With Ohio State losing, Miss. State finishing the season 10-2, UCLA now at 9-3, arizona getting a 3rd loss to be at 10-3, Georgia at 9-3, Mizzou at 10-3 and Baylor 10-2 with a weaker SOS, the committee has no other team to turn to, and is forced to put 12-1 Florida State back in the playoff despite their loss to UF.

Everyone loses. 




 If Arizona beats Oregon twice in one season do they deserve to definitively be ranked in front of Oregon? 




 Yeah. The Seminole Tribe was the only native American tribe to successfully resist relocation and/or some form of surrender to the U.S. government. 




 I want Baylor. But I'd also take TCU/Ohio State.

Honestly, an Alabama/Oregon matchup has been blueballing the nation for half a decade now and I just want to see it go down finally. 




 Same. And to be honest, looking Alabama's performance in away games, I think we'd stand more than a puncher's chance on a neutral field. 




 In exchange for your support, we'll also beat Georgia Tech. 



... Yep, really doin' you guys a favor here 




 Oooh, I missed the "by win percentages overall" part, sorry. 




 I wouldn't call Michigan a top-5 program.

Oklahoma, USC, Alabama, Nebraska, Notre Dame, and Ohio State are all probably in front of them, and probably Texas too. 




 We've actually won 39 of our last 41! 




 12 for Vucevic  
4 for Harris  
1 for Channing Frye


*This does however include two ties with opposing teams, however the last 13 games have been outright 




 I actually think UF/FSU is a bigger rival for both teams than UGA/Miami
