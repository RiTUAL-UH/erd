 I do not see what you see here? 




 This wasn't much of a shrink in die size compared to others (from 32-14) so the performance isn't a massive step up (relatively speaking, again). The problem at that scale is that the more the die shrinks, the more opportunity there will be for failures, errors, etc...and even if these chips are clocked down (which they probably have to be) that's a lot of heat to take care of. 














 Pottery piece 




 your appreciation of its beauty is priceless. Other than that, it is not worth money, although you could take it somewhere and have a cabochon made that might have slight value. 




 I have something almost exactly similar, down to the dolomite. These are from western NC--almost a guarantee. Don't see anything similar anywhere else, at least not in the US. Edit, and yes, it's ruby. 
























 So jealous--what a wonderful outing that must have been. I am working on restoring a fireplace with stone up and down the sides. A haul like this would make me rethink how for certain. 





























 Weird, I can't find much about HPX--have a good overivew somewhere in the link department? 




 Anagrams / Acronyms ;) 




 Message Passing Interface.

High Performance Computing. 














 I forget that no one wants to read how this stuff works at scale to the point where it can be scary. They just want to read about how it's scary. Sigh. 




 If not, has that been a slow evolution away from placing any value on it (and what it might mean for your machine to wind up on the Top 500) or did it never matter? And bonus question--does the new companion benchmark (HPCG) seem like it will be any more valuable? If it's not valuable and your organization still runs LINPACK and publishes Top 500 results, why do it? Vendor pressure? Curiosity? 




 I didn't know that subreddit existed--a lot of great stuff there that borders HPC. What others might I be missing, especially those that revolve around chips/architectural things?  





























 I think it is silicified. I used to live up near there and that stuff is found frequently. This is a more sediment covered piece, but if you find or clean pieces that aren't, it's hard as a rock coral. 




 I think the wildlife uses of this are mentioned tongue in cheek. The idea is that the actual uses for it that people can think up is what matters.  




 Yet at the top of the local news feeds for the Bay Area it's all John Lennon's wife's life in retrospect and news on soaring bank gains. One massive algae bloom can render East Bay without drinking water--and aside from shipping it in, there are not alternatives. So what happens when CA water demands press eastward? 




 Quartzite for the most part. Not uncommon but always nice to look at--I have several similar hunks that line a stream now. 




 Fossilized coral 




 Okay. It looks salesy but haven't seen an ARM-based cloud like this. Problem is, it's in France. And... yeah. Well. 
























 Okay so this made my entire day. 




 Agreed and frankly, some research into this revealed it's just not possible beyond the "semi-automatic" approaches he lists in his article. Anyone think this is promising for really gnarly code? Loops aside this seems rather optimistic. All interesting nonetheless. 




 Ah well damn. It looks like I grabbed the link to the map itself--the way machine learning was used in the research project to create it was a cool little story but now that page on github isn't working at all. I'll try to load it again in a bit--if it doesn't I'll post a quick synopsis. It's not rocket science, but I can see how things like this can be personalized and integrated into mobile mapping functions and applications. 









 I know it's Intel sponsored, but the article is actually pretty good and balanced.  









 Has anyone here worked with this or other "automatic parallelizers" of any sort. There aren't many and none seem to stack up to anything. This company seems pretty secret sauce about how they do it--not sure if it's even possible. 







































 That is the claim--would sure like to see more about how that benchmark was run though.
