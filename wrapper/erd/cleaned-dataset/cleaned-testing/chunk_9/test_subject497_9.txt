 Thank you very sincerely. I'm thankful that I shared Diane's final act of love and devotion. Sharing it feels less lonely.  




 Thank you very much. The response has been more than I could have imagined, and I'm thankful that Diane continues to inspire joy and love, even after her passing.  




 Mujhe apni patni ki yada a raha hai apna khayal rakhna, dost. maf kijiye, mujhe Hindi nahee ati hai. mai U.S. se hum. My mom's from Delhi but my dad's from the South. We mostly spoke English at home. Apna Khyal Rakhna.
 




 My dad is Tamil, and my mom's from Delhi. They met here in the U.S. though. I didn't feel a particularly strong connection to North or South, which is I guess, why I wound up marrying a gora... 




 My parents are Indian, but I grew up in the U.S.
