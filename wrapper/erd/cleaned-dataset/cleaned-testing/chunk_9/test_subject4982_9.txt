 True story. I remember some of the oddest people would take hits of acid with me and I never would have thought.  




 University in Ohio. I've always been an herbal kind of gal. Hence TORCHHTOKE, good grades, degree, and the curiosity to dabble with other things such a shrooms and every once in a while acid. Always ending back in the dorm. (I have a great buddy system.)

My roommate on the other hand...not so smart. She started doing heroin. She came from a small town outside Cleveland. Since she lived so close she normally stayed there, eventually failing out because she missed so many classes. 

Well turned out, one day after I ate some shrooms with my gay best friend and went to a local hole in the wall bar and got decently fucked up and we walked back. Opened the door. And there is my roommate, looking like a scene from a horror movie. Wet hair covering her face squating over my coffee pot taking a shit into it. She obviously was zooted out of her mind because it took her a good minute to realize we were staring at her. She then proceeded to pick up her shit and throw it at us. 

I was boomin so hard that I started laughing then ran away. When the RA came to the room they found her laying on the bathroom floor covered in her shit. Obviously called the authorities. When our room was searched I told them exactly what I had in my drawer safe. Condoms, birth control, a 8th of shrooms and $2000. When the cop opened it up he looked at me. Tossed me my baggie of shrooms. And said "We will be searching the rest of the room now you may leave."

When I came back, sobered up a little she was arrested. Charged with some heavy shit and I never saw or spoke to her again. 


I hope she's doing okay because she had so much potential. Still stoked I got away with those shrooms. 

P.S- I have another story that is so fucked up. Maybe for later.



EDIT 1: Typos. Sorry I'm tired.

EDIT 2: grammar 




 So unfortunate.  




 GLORIOUS!  




 Since there are 13 books (some of my favorite) how many seasons do you think it would be? 

To Beatrice- When we were together I felt breathless. Now you are. 




 This literally is what mine look like everyday in the summer. I don't go swimming or wear shorts it sucks.  




 LMAO HAHAHAHAHA my man is a vegan and he eats my carnist pussy all the damn time and loves it. 




 That show terrified me as a child.  




 BHOLE 




 That's a Doozer.  




 Hey /u/RandomguyDota like this?? 




 How does something like that fucking happen?! I'm washing my vagina right now... 




 I clicked........I will forever be disgusted with myself. 




 I have a great life now! I have been seeing my new guy for a year and he's amazing, no children, managing a top notch restaurant. Where I want and need to be. In a really good place. He's 40 now, single and working at Tire Man. (Me leaving forced him to get a job.) Last I heard he got pulled over for a DUI. So yeah...good riddance. 




 I left out that he is 37. But I agree. My mother was adopted and after meeting her biological mother...it was a good thing.  




 I love finding mistakes like thus in movies or shows. Makes me feel like "Hey! Even celebrities who are made out to be perfect sometimes can't get it right. So when I'm drunk and can't answer my phone correctly I don't feel bad about myself. "  




 Forgot something crucial for work. Came home during my lunch break to get it and my fiance and this girl were tangled in my sheets. I simply got what I needed and walked out of the house. He ran after me asking why I wasn't fighting for him. I asked him "Why would I fight for someone who isn't faithful?" And that was it. Moved back in with my parents the next day. 

P.S- He got her pregnant. She had a baby boy, and put the child up for adoption. She said having a kid would be a burden at 19.

  




 Cheers friend. Tomorrow is a new day 




 I live by lake Erie, so I literally have a lot to do. Cedar Point, Put-In-Bay, wineries, my cottage is 45 mins away in Michigan. So much shit..but I guess that all involves drinking HA!  




 Bummer! Sorry I hope I never have to repeat a day like this again.  




 Thanks! Pouring will proceed!  




 Me! Cheers from North West OHIO!  




 I've had a seriously strange day. Odd, sad, confusing and bizarre things have been happening to me. So now I'm drunk. Off orange vodka, soda. At the local dive bar. Cheers Reddit! Cheers Ohio!  




 This is actually the picture that brought me to Reddit three years ago. 


I know it says "one year', this is my second account. 




 In my city, Chinese are the worst drivers. 




 Elephants are elegant creatures. It makes me sick to think someone would do something like this.
