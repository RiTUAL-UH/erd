 Thanks, I think I needed this. I've really been contemplating reading them soon, but haven't been able to convince myself. This is a real help. 




 Did not know that... Awesome 




 Which is ok, because they'll know that for a fact.  




 I heard that exact story but about Beethoven... 




 Never seen the film, but the book was a great read. 




 Yes yes yes yes yes. 

Behind The Ocean, American Gods is absolutely the best. It really has to be read. And then read 'Fragile Things' and 'Trigger Warnings', for the short stories. Also because they're both excellent. Also The Graveyard book, and Good Omens (with Terry Pratchett) =D 




 It's pretty obvious to say we spend far too much time on social media. On the internet as a whole. Googling things to find out even the simplest of questions. 

Say what you will about what this has done for society because, assuming there isn't some colossal catastrophe, we have a fixation with documenting every single thing we do. And sure, it's annoying now, but in a hundred years, historians will be able to look back and pinpoint this time as the first time that history was never a huge question mark. They'll be able to look back and see perfectly what we were like, what we did in our spare time, how we felt about everything. We have photographic proof of the food we eat, and the things we liked to watch. We have videos of what we used to do, and looked like and sounded like. For the first time we don't have to guess and assume and put together tiny pieces of a much larger puzzle piece, because it's all there, laid out for future generations.

And that, to me, is pretty damn exciting. 




 (Why) would you takes notes of a book?

(except in the instance of needing to make a reference - for an essay, say). 




 No, you haven't. You gotta learn your facts from somewhere. So long as you didn't look it up just now before you posted :) 




 Hit me with a random fact off the top of your head, if you have to google it, you're cheating.

 Polo indeed - that's a proper royal sport. 




 You really must hate Croquet...

And Boules.  




 How about rather than facing the possibility of closing down you do what every self-published studio must do and *self-promote like a goddamn motherbitch!* 




 I understand how hypotheticals work, but there aren't any stars even remotely near us - that are due to go supernova - that would affect Earth. I'm just being a space nerd, continue with your stories :D 




 The Abhorsen trilogy is like this. The second installment, Lirael, is longest, and Abhorsen, the finale, is the shrotest of the lot.

Also The Night Angel Trilogy gets shorter by each book. 

I also think this is quite a trend with YA where the original idea only fills up the first book, and the rest is just meandering bullshit - clasping at straws to drag the bastard out into a trilogy.

Also the 'The Passage' series. It isn't finished yet but the second book, 'The Twelve' is about half the size of the The Passage, the first one. The last book isn't out yet,  :'(, so we'll have to get a final count for that.

These are just the books I can look to my bookshelf and see.  




 Also, faster streaming. For the same reason. 




 PS4. You're cutting out the middle-man if you don't use a graphics card. The quality gets turned down going into the CC up to your PC and out.  




 It's kind of the reason I don't want to read it now I'm an adult. I'm not sure I'll like it. Having such high expectations, but having so much more to compare it to. I'm worried I'll understand it too well, and not like it. 




 Me too. I haven't read it in super long because I'm scared of it. 




 My favourite drink is Coke. You've probably tried it.

Other than that just normal, English Tea :)

Oh, also, Fanta + Coke is surprisingly nice. And, if you can, adding some Sprite in there is great too. When I worked at McDonalds we could help ourselves to small drinks, so we used to mix them see what tasted nice. Fanta + Coke is surprisingly good. 




 Making his excuses, John rose from his chair. Struggling to make his way through the busy pub, he emerged from the heavy door into the weak midday sun. Collecting himself, he headed towards the Cathedral. 

Better? Worse? 




 This game was fucking BOSS! My childhood right there. Sat with my sister (who was bigger than me, so she got to control the mouse), as we tried to work out the levels. 




 It had to end the way it did. No way around it. 




 No. The books are horrendously awful. But the films are ok. 




 Glad I could help :) 




 How To Train Your Dragon 2 finale I thought was excellently animated. Perfect. And was, hands down, better than both films. 




 I haven't read it in ten years give me a break :( 




 Ah see...sorted. No problems there. 




 You're excused. 




 I'm 23. I read this when I was 13. No matter how many books I've read, some I've liked enough to get tattooed, nothing has even come close to The His Dark Materials. 




 I've tried other stuff. Catch-22, and Toh-Kay and Keasbey Nights. Just nothing compares to Streetlight Manifesto. They're insane. 




 Dude. I thought you were totally on Streetlight Manifesto. Not the other one. When I was talking about the album, I meant this one. This one is amazing! 




 Holy shit, I'm about to go to bed so I was like "yeah, I'll listen to this song quickly."

It's not the Streetlight Manifesto version, and it's not as good. Oh god, its quite terrible actually. Listening to the proper one now, drop the link here methinks. 

[Ah, that's better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfAdFKJfHZ4) 




 Tomb Raider.

Never played Uncharted. Love TR as a kid on PS1. Loved the prequel to Rise of the TR, so... 




 That's the best thing for it to be. 




 Interesting interesting. :)

Genre? 




 It certainly helps. The longer you can stay in the swing the easier it is to stick at a single project for a long time. 




 There have been times when It's been late and I've had to stop writing because I have scared myself. I guess that's stupid, but I scare easily. 

Just, when you write your serial novels where you want to put them for people to read them on the web. You said forum host, not sure what that means.

I just assumed you had a kind of a strategy for putting them on the web. Where to put them, how often, how to make get max views, that sorta thing. 




 My first novel I never pushed myself. It took 3 years, and there's nothing wrong with that. But this new novel I'm pushing myself to write 1k words every day and so far it's really useful.

Whatever works best for you, and there is really no reason to push yourself. But having immediate results gets hella satisfying. 




 They are simply amazing. This album and their new one has so far proven to be the best two though.  




 Ah, that sounds cool. Good luck with the novel. 




 You mean, this is a book and not just a film. My priorities just shifted! 




 Instant internet win for the first ever Streetlight Manifesto reference I have ever come across. A.K.A FUCK YEAH!

I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this song, this album, and THIS BAND! 




 What's your plan for the web serial novels? Got any idea where to post them?

I write any genre really. Especially in shorts. Some horror, some romance. Really all over the place. 




 Best way to get a legit following is for them to see your book on a shelf :) 




 Kudos. You're doing it. Just gotta get better and get that book deal. 




 Hey, writing piecemeal is better than writing nothing. At least you get something done, even it if it's something small.

Like I always say: Progress for it's own sake. 




 Does sound pretty good. 




 There's a story here. 




 Lots of different things. Shorts I write in every genre. Dabble in poetry. My first novel was action/adventure/sci-fi. My new novel is horror/low-fantasy/literary.  




 Yeah I got that. I don't know anyone else who writes. Does suck. 




 15 years is a long time to keep it secret? Why haven't you told anyone? 




 **The Amber Spyglass**

*"Where are we going?"*

*"To build the kingdom of Heaven"*

What I mean is that whole book destroyed me. 




 There is always time. Find time. 7 years is 7 years too long to be away from writing. If there isn't time *make* time! 




 I just want to call out your name because I'm pretty sure it's a reference to *A Day To Remember*, and that's pretty freakin' awesome. 




 Ah, that's not important anyway. Haha. 




 That's a lot of stuff.

I'm working on my second novel at the moment. 




 Well, Emo Culture had to get its inspiration from somewhere. 




 That sounds really interesting. I would read that =] 




 We don't know what the year is. I can load, cock and fire an assault rifle in seconds, but I cannot read a clock. Signs I have read on my campaigns tell me I'm near a place called London. I have never seen the ocean, very few of us have, so I have never left this place. 

First there were the wars. Then we lost people. Then towns and cities were leveled. Then, there were no more countries. I have counted the days I have marched between seeing one green thing, and another. The rest is brown, dead earth and grey, oppressive skies.

Another sign says I'm in London proper. The building's here are the tallest I have ever seen. Though the bones penetrating free from the top of their brick tell me they are no longer as tall as they once were. We will put an end to this war. Not that I, or my parents, or their parents, had any damn clue what we were fighting for. Here we will meet the factions, and we will lay down our arms, and we will dance, and drink. 

The water here is black, and it swallows our weapons and erases them from existence. We spend the night building bonfires, hunting wild animals and drinking the fermented apples and grapes we have brought with us. I meet a girl. And two weeks later we have fallen in love.

There are no more wars. No more enemies. Only allies, and peace. We are left alone, this dark-haired girl and I, to explore this London on our own.

Three weeks later I meet a man whose name I never learned. And when I see him in the arms of my dark-haired girl I attack him and beat him to death. 

War is reignited. There is no war without love. And there is no love without war. 




 Ooh, *out there*, hey? Do tell. =D 




 The room is unnervingly silver. Each wall is a blacked out window and the two subjects feel that through each, eyes are watching them. The room is perfectly square, with a silver table lining one side.

This surface is lined with knives and tools. Each brand new, never used. A circular saw (plugged through the wall and out). A scalpel. A butcher's knife and a meat cleaver. A wire saw. And others.

In the middle there are two surfaces, beds. Again, silver. So shiny and clean that anyone leaning over it would see their reflection staring back at them perfectly. These beds are unremarkable except for the cuffs designed to hold arms and ankles in place, and the bands to stop the person moving entirely.

But the most remarkable thing, as the subject enters the room, is the person standing up and strapped against the only wall that wasn't a window. It was a he, middle-aged and insignificant looking, if not entirely unattractive. He was bound to the wall by his hands and feet and chest, and gagged. He stares at the newcomer mournfully, his eyes a perfect display of pain and sorrow that the new subject couldn't help but feel guilty for. Though without reason.

From no where comes a buzz of static, and a voice. 'Hello, subject 12.This is subject 11. Can I just confirm that neither have you have ever seen each other before in your lives?'

They both shake their heads.

'Good,' the voice continues. 'The purpose of this test is simple. Subject 11 here will die.'

The person across the room visibly shakes and audibly moans, echoing loudly.

'You, subject 12, may stop that. What you cannot stop is him getting hurt entirely. Across the room from you are some utensils. The rules are simple, and the decision is entirely up to you. If you do not harm yourself, at all, subject 11 will die. Slowly, horribly and painfully. If you, subject 12, were to say pick up that knife there and cut off your finger, subject 11 might only lose both his arms. Cut out your eye, and subject 11 might only lose a hand. Understand? Inflict greater pain on yourself, and you will save the stranger a lot of pain himself. The door behind you is unlocked, you can leave anytime you want. Good luck.'

5 grand. And all it might cost you is an arm. The ad didn't say that.

The second subject crosses the room and looks at the instruments laid out in front of them. The man watches their progress. Watches as they gently finger each item. Subject 11 coos as they brush past the circular saw. Cowers when they pick up a bread knife. 

*What to do, to save the life of a stranger?*

*Is my life,* thinks subject 12, *worth that of a strangers?*

They pick up the scalpel and threaten their eye with it, so close they can see the edge. They drop it. They press the trigger on the saw, and it whirs to life with the crisp, robotic sound of ear-splitting whirring. It goes back on the surface. They place their finger over the edge and raise high the meat cleaver. Hesitate. Put their wrist their instead.

*Is it worth it?*

Back goes the meat cleaver.

*Am I worth more than this man?*



 




 I only ask because I did post something on here yesterday, was wondering if you actually came across it. 




 Zombie genre is so wide and open, how can you not like it? It's so multi-faceted...So many angles. 




 Well, it's all about conversation. I'm just surprised there's so many writers here, for a sub aimed at such a general demographic.  




 Which post was that? 









 I've also found myself drawn to that specific genre from time to time.  




 Thankyou ^ ^ 




 Must be nice to have a sub-reddit named after yourself. Kudos to her. Thanks for this! =] 




 I've made threads about writing, and so many people are also writers. And on other threads I'm just checking out, people are writing! And it's awesome there seems to be a sub-culture of writer's on CC but we haven't really ever come together.

Come on CC, let's talk about writing. Tell us about what you write, and your current projects!

Edit: *Buggar, missed out on the question mark in the title. Don't hate on me :(* 




 Who was that? Who got their own subreddit? 




 Was going to have a shot at this prompt but you won so hard I don't want to attempt anything else.

 




 Get up for 8:30. Showered by 9, and at my desk about fifteen minutes later after breakfast. I write at least 1000 words into my novel, sometimes more, sometimes less. Then lunch or more work (depending on how I'm feeling about the novel). Then, after lunch. I choose to write for either my script or my game, whichever is more pressing. Usually both if I can squeeze them in. And I try and do that till 5. Then it's read for a few hours, mooch on Netflix, eat my tea, and play a game on Xbox or read some more or watch a film. 




 [Amy](https://www.wattpad.com/146298625-amy)

This is also a link to my wattpad page. So if you like Amy, check out the rest. I'm really keen on feedback, so please; if you want to rip it apart I welcome you to. Either on this thread or over on Wattpad. I appreciate it :) 




 What is this!? 




 Do you want a hug?

Uh-huh. 




 This sounds like "The Host". 




 Which other subreddit, if I might ask? I'm looking for a place to try and get some stuff out as well. 




 * Catdog
* Ren and Stimpy
* ^^Motherfucking Power Rangers!
 




 What did the mods say? What did you say? 




 Well, the potentials there. 




 It's not naive at all. And if it was, I'd rather comfort someone and be naive, than be cold and an asshole.  




 Feel free to check out my other stuff if you fancy it. It's all on the wattpad profile. Let me know if you do, and what you think. 




 You understand the quote though. 




 *"Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live it's whole life believing it is stupid."* - Albert Einstein.  




 I think I'm pretty happy with the order as it is. It was a really spontaneous story and I don't want to mess with that spontaneity. When I was in the zone - and writing it - I knew which part had to come next, so I don't want to mess it.

By format do you mean non-chronology? 

Possibly. Hard to say. Like I said the non-chronology was the result of something's not working together, that eventually turned out to work really well when I looked at them from a different angle. It wasn't wholly intentional. Why? 




 Does anyone else have misgivings over this? 




 You mean, that can happen? There's funny stuff that *isn't* on the internet? 









 To be honest that just sort of happened, I didn't really have any choice in the matter. There was so much in the story I wanted to get across, that in order to do that I had to keep on jumping backwards and forwards. Once I realised what was happening, I trimmed the story, kept some things back until the end for narrative purposes and then just wrote whichever bit of the story felt right to write next. 




 The size of it. How much you can do. Admittedly it might not seem like anything to EvE online players, but to me that's pretty exciting. The game holds a sense of discovery, and of isolation, and might be the closest we've got, in a video game, to actually getting out there and discovering these things for ourselves. 














 How was this not the first one on the list? 




 I'm super fucking excited, but will appropriately wait until I know more about the game to commit. 









 It's not heavy romance, to be honest. Very little romance in it. Just takes that angle at times. Sometimes tends to the sexual over the romantic - though that wasn't entirely intentional. 




 I am. Does that make a difference? 




 Thankyou kindly :) 









 **S, or; Straka**, By J.J Abrams and Doug Dorif. 




 Dreams are fascinating because even though we understand that REM sleep is our brains way of cataloging the events of the day. And the reason why our brains wierd out in the night is pretty well known, why all these things come together and allow us to run through (seemingly) absolutely random stories and events, with somewhat clear images and emotions, we have no idea. But our bodies are so used to this that the brain paralyzes itself during sleep so we don't enact these dreams. That's pretty...fascinating. 




 I've just started a booktube channel. Uploaded the second episode today. 




 Well, I know what I have to do now haha. 




 10 hour music videos. Awesome. Didn't expect there to be a big audience there, but hey, what do I know? 




 Well done!

What are your video's about? I'm trying to start up my own channel at the moment. 









 I know I'm pretty much repeating what a lot of other people have said, but absolutely fair play to the guy. It's not like people are just giving him the money, he absolutely earns it. And it doesn't matter how many people dislike him, he gets his views and he's the most subscribed to channel for a reason.

And, more's the matter, he seems like a pretty nice bloke. Whenever he does videos like this, he seems calm and kind. He has done charity work and that certainly shouldn't be forgotten. And it shouldn't matter if you like him or hate him, you have to appreciate the charity work that's done.
