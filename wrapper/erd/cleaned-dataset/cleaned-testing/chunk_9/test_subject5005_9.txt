  Why do you think Pao would take this case to court when it has no chance of succeeding?

Because she is bankrupt and this was more than likely the only chance that she would be able to take anyone on this planet and a past employer for more than 100 million dollars...all while doing nothing but pay a lawyer to convince a jury that they should award her over 100 million dollars. She jumped at the opportunity to grab over 100 million bucks while literally doing nothing but saying that people were mean to her because of her gender. 

Her and her husband are in the hole for something likely close to 100 million dollars by some estimates. That's just unbelievable, really. How else would she and her likely prison-bound husband pay off those debts and pull themselves out of a 100 million dollar hole? Probably by trying to sue someone for about the same amount. 
 




 A Feast for Bros 




  but a CEO that engages in a law suit you don't agree with, then that bitch has got to go.

She lost resoundingly in the lawsuit and her claims were found to be totally without merit. Myself and thousands of other redditors over the past year saw this and saw the suit and her for what they were: a cynical way to bail her criminal husband out of jail (maybe literally) and for her to cash out by screwing her former boss and company over. How is noting someone's past behavior at a Silicon Valley company an "ad hominem" not worthy of discussion? For months, redditors in this subreddit and others were all over what was coming out about her past behavior and about her husband and how this made her look as a person and as the new CEO of reddit. The view that this site had of her was never positive and has been that way since January right up until this week when some people are now viewing her as this wronged woman who did nothing wrong. 

 All your criticisms are based on her personal life. They are personal attacks.

Not at all. I clearly discussed her personal and professional life and the bleeding together of the two and how she was toxic upon assuming the role of CEO. Not just me but the majority of reddit saw her as unfit to be CEO of this site given what we came to know about her since January or right around the time that she became CEO and people started talking about her during her discrimination trial. 

 You claim to hate SJW, but you are obsessed with irrelevant details about someone's personal life.

Her personal opinions and views are not irrelevant when she is the CEO of reddit and she has more than enough power to try and instill her views and values on the site and therefore on all of its users. Do you and others really not forget her blog posts and announcement posts on this site that reeked of tech world double-speak and mushy language that people were pissed off about? Reddit literally downvoted one of her posts beyond zero because they were so ticked off with her view of how the site should be run. She announced her views to us all so this isn't speculation it's just the facts and a retelling of how reddit reacted to her opinions and views for the site.  




 ITT: Redditors managing to forget that regardless of what Pao did or didn't do on this site, she was a scummy, shady character before she ever became CEO here and that was the reason why reddit didn't want her around. 

You guys seem to conveniently forget that she sued her former mentor and boss for close to 100 million dollars in a gender discrimination suit in which she lost big time. You all seem to forget that she did so out of desperation because her husband bankrupted their family through a failed Ponzi scheme in which he drained the pension funds of many people through his criminal behavior that may well send him to federal prison at some point. She literally sued her past employer in Silicon Valley for nearly the exact same amount of money that her husband lost through his shady and criminal business dealings. How soon reddit forgets.

Totally turned on her mentor, boss, and "biggest advocate and defender" in order to try and loot his company for over 100 million dollars based on accusations that the jury ultimately found to be resoundingly baseless. She didn't get a cent and *she* has to pay her former boss and company's legal bills for suing them over a baseless accusation that threatened to tarnish the entire company and an honest guy who was her champion in Silicon Valley. Low life stuff from her. 

You guys seem to forget that her and her husband are seedy, scummy, shady characters who have a history that is available for everyone to read about. Redditors found out about it and called her out for it in numerous threads before she even started doing anything unpopular on reddit and no one could understand why reddit would get into bed with not just her but with her husband since she was taking this job here as her "do or die" job where she was going to try and rebuild her image and career while facing down bankruptcy. 

[Highly-entertaining profile on both of them that shows you who Pao and her husband are](http://fortune.com/2012/10/25/ellen-pao-buddy-fletcher/)

[Same as above. Very informative and entertaining read.](http://www.vanityfair.com/style/scandal/2013/03/buddy-fletcher-ellen-pao)

[The guy is a criminal. No two ways about it. Pao pulled the gender discrimination card only after her husband played the race card first. This is who these people are. They cry discrimination, sue people with deep pockets over it, and then sometimes come away with major settlements or punitive damages. Scummy people with little to no integrity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Fletcher)

[Update on their relationship and professional lives from this week.](http://nypost.com/2015/07/12/ellen-pao-hedgie-husband-are-losing-their-power-couple-status/)

You also seem to forget that she has a history of associating with the types of people labeled as social justice warriors and feminists who are big fans of censorship and that reddit rightly had major concerns about how she was going to run the website as a result. For example, her Twitter feed, friends, and tweets reeked of this sort of stuff before she even was CEO and it paints that picture of someone who reddit rightly didn't want anywhere near the main controls of this site. Her tweeting during in the lead up to her gender discrimination trial and all of her interactions on Twitter was something straight out of the Anita Sarkeesian playbook and it was noxious for me to read through since it just reeked of "I'm a victim please give me money" nonsense that we've seen before from professional victims like her. None of these views or opinions turned out to be erroneous at all because her and her husband have an open history of this sort of stuff and reddit watched her entire trial unfold for weeks and chronicled it all and found her to be what the jury found her to be: a scheming, cynical opportunist and hustler who was totally full of it and not credible. 

These really aren't my sole opinions; they're the opinions of redditors that I have read about Pao since January yet people seem to be forgetting this week why she was so unpopular a selection for CEO in the first place. All of the people coming out of the woodwork this week acting like she literally did nothing wrong, was a good fit for CEO, and that she was wrongly chastized and scrutinized are pretty delusional and have bad memories. Did she personally ban FatPeopleHate? Probably not her personally but her and Alexis definitely sat down and agreed to get rid of the sub. Was reddit really so wrong to assume that **the CEO of this site was not the one who gave the order to ban FPH and other offensive subreddits?** Absolutely not. The CEO is very much the person calling the shots not just here but in most other companies or corporations so people coming out of the woodwork this week acting like reddit just pulled another Boston Bomber manhunt screw-up again are over-the-top and delusional.

 More like an obitchuary.  




 Probably because Pao didn't have the good graces not to throw her boss under the bus in order to score millions of dollars to pay off her shady husband's debt. Reddit didn't like Pao not just for her decisions on reddit but because her and her husband are scummy, shady people.
