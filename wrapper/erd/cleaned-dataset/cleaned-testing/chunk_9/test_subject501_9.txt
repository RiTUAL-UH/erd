 Quite hilarious.  




 Do you like Scorsese's other stuff? (the director) if you liked this you should watch his other films. 









 Daud again? Something different? 




 Victoria? Sorry, I'm not familiar with this. 









 Context please? 




 When Jules Winnfield quotes the bible in Pulp Fiction. 




 And just last night I was wondering when PTA would announce his next film. 




 Holy shit. Thanks.  









 Do you remember which book? 




 Where does it say that?  




 Looks better than expected. 




 I agree. On the low chaos ending, we can see Corvo, Sam and a few others at the hound pitts. Corvo is just standing there quietly with is drink, watching the others have fun. I don't know why but that just fleshes out his character much more. 









 Fuck yes.  




 What is he like? What are Corvo's characteristics? Can someone please come up with a bit of a description of this based on what you know? I'm fascinated by this character but I don't know enough about him, can we all help each other out? I want to know more about Corvo's character. 




 As for Corvo's character, I would love to see a torn and weathered man who is still strong and protective of Emily.  









 People, there are still scenes that were shown in the trailer of Ray that we haven't seen in the show yet. It's kinda obvious he lives. Rubber bullets perhaps? A warning?  




 edit: Thank you for all of your comments! 




 Guy Ritchie's best IMO, followed closely by Lock Stock. The writing is brilliant and often hilarious, I love the fast and edgy tone and editing of the film. One of Brad Pitt's best performances, Statham, Vinnie Jones, Del Toro, and all the others are all fantastic. Would love to hear what you guys think of it.

 Why did the critics hate on it? 




 [The Raid 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orNKptscG0A) 




 I have a confession to make, /r/offmychest in a way. I have only seen the first Godfather film. Please someone egg me on to watch the second. 




 Blow off Choffer. 









 Prisoners came out in 2013. 









 I don't get it. It's just one of Daud's Assassins?  




 Any advice for a want-to-be cinematographer? 









 Cant wait for Hail Caesar. Reading the [cast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail,_Caesar!) is enough to get you interested. 




 Do I want to watch this? 




 He'll either get nominated for this or Steve Jobs. 









 Yeah, until the 17th of December. 




 A lot worse cinematographers than Deakins? 









 What are your thoughts on it?

Edit: My mistake, PKD wrote the book which the film is based off. Probably should have mentioned that. 




 Just watched that as well. 




 Yeah fuck I'm an idiot. 









 Wahlberg???

Edit: Fucking hell I'm an idiot. Boogie Nights, of course. How could I have forgotten?  
























 This'll be fun.  




 Within the next couple of weeks I'd say. Like you said, when the definitive edition is released we'll definitely be getting more on D2. 




 Indeed that chapter was fucked up. Describing how he gets a boner when he kills animals sent chills up my spine. And him....jerking off Henry.....was just......FUCKED. 




 **The most** 




 I feel you. But IMO that's what makes his films so great, they're nice and slow, character driven films.  




 Please don't spoil anything, but if it does include spoilers, just let me know how big they are.  




 Both actually. It's a combination of King Crimson's album 'In the court of the Crimson King' and also of the Crimson King from Stephen King's Dark Tower books, if that's what you're referring to. Thanks for asking. 




 That is actually quite a nice poster. Better than half the other poorly photo-shopped shit. 









 The stuff of nightmares 




 Jake Gyllenhaal.

He's proved himself an actor to keep an eye out for since Brokeback Mountain. But recently with Source Code, End of Watch, Prisoners, Enemy, Nightcrawler and probably his upcoming movie 'Southpaw' he's proved himself to be a must see actor in ANY film he's in. He's got 3 coming out this year, Southpaw, Everest and Demolition. I'll happily be seeing all 3 of them.  




 Oooh, any other books on Corvo? 




 Spoiler alert you fucking dipshit.  




 Any stand-out books? if you can remember. 




 Say what you want but I think Eisenberg will kill it as Luthor. Him saying this now just increases my faith in him to bring this character justice.  




 I'm just wondering if they are worth reading. I'm thinking of going through the game again this time reading all the books. Is it a waste of time? 




 Someone give this guy gold. 




 I'm interested to see what Emily's combat system is like. 




 That shot of the dead bodies in the wall will be staying with me for quite a few days. 














 Deakins and Coen brothers. Now Deakins and Villeneuve. Who will it be next? 




 Your guilty pleasure movie/tv show? 




 This makes me more excited for the sequel. 



















 You're fucking kidding.... 




 lol its been out on region b for ages.  




 Sucks. Do you know if they are getting new stock? 




 I went over to EB games, but they've fucking sold out.  




 Same here -_- 









 Pleeeeease be good.

 Quite correct. 









 What did you think of it? 




 "Him" being Spielberg correct? 




 Telegraph Road is their best, IMO. 




 That's pretty cool. I especially like that specific Big Lebowski one... 




 Perfection. 









 The biggest and most anticipate film of the decade. And hopefully the best, IMO. 




 Yeah, until the 17th of December. 




 Was it a loading symbol to a website or... 




 Sorry, what is this? 









 Looks awesome. 




 Ahahahaha 75 people apparently.  




 Imagine going through there on acid. 




 Please god... 




 Pretty sure it was a funeral from what I can remember. 




 You're gonna need a bigger cage... 









 There's a part of me that actually WANTS Michael Bay to direct. Perhaps he can redeem himself. Or not. Probably not.  




 Neo-Noir, mystery, thriller, mature comedy (not silly stuff), dark films and quality action. Also, romance that ISN'T melodramatic and is mature and grounded. 




 I'm thinking of watching that next, how funny is it? 




 I know, it's pretty bad. Everyone just looks at the world through there fucking phones, it's pathetic. 

Edit: By everyone I mean most of the current teenagers...therefore not everyone, but most. 




 I'm just watching 12 Angry Men and I am enjoying the fucking hell outta this movie. Please can someone tell me what are some more black and white classic films? Only the good stuff, the real good stuff. 



















 Deakins said that he thought he couldn't bring anything 'new' into this bond film, THAT is good decision making. Upon hearing that, my respect for him went up. 




 There is no better quality one. 




 Terrific trailer, had me at 'from the director of The Others'. That movie was terrific, I'm on board. 




 This just gets me more excited for Steve Jobs. I know for a fact he'll win again next year.

Also, the look on Fincher's face when Sorkin is praising him, man that would mean ALOT. 



















 People, Terrio re-wrote the script, and he's won an academy award for best adapted screenplay. Let's not forget that. 




 Looks promising. 




 Zodiac

Spirited Away

Schindler's List 
 




 This is the second positive review I've read now. I'm getting my hopes up. 




 More Modern Classics getting remade for TV?

Haven't heard of that before. 




  "Deuce Bigalow" is aggressively bad, as if it wants to cause suffering to the audience. The best thing about it is that it runs for only 75 minutes.

He had a way with words, that's for sure. 




 Incredible.  




 7pm PST, but you'd have to double check. 




 Da H8ful 8 m8 




 Could've sworn I read something that said there was an alien on Mars with him...

 









 Wow. 




 That thumbnail... 














 I know this sounds stupid but is this an official in game screen shot?

Don't kill me. 




 His best film by far.
