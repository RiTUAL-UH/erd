 And Scherff left with knee injury. Looks bad 




 So it goes Robin :( 




 This is devastating. A pure comic genius. So it goes Robin... 




 Hey folks. I am about to start my first year teaching at a high school. I will be teaching US History and a Government class at a Hmong-American Charter. Was wondering if any fellow Social Studies teachers out there had any classroom design/decoration ideas? Resources for quality Historical posters or something? Just trying to brainstorm some ideas. Or maybe just hearing how others have decorated their rooms? Thanks for anyone looking to help a guy out! 




 Is the plan for Harvey to return and pitch this year yet? 




 Yeah, clearly ruining his day... 




 Poor Eli... 









 So you must have missed the news of him winning a gold glove. Or him being a back-to-back all-star. You're right only news of him being a shithead. And wishing an injury on the guy?? Now who is being a shithead? I get it. You don't like the guy, but that's pretty classless for a guy spouting off about integrity for the game. 




 What a completely useless comment. I would love an actual reason of why he is a shithead. Breaking the bat on his knee and throwing a helmet? Its called frustration, it happens. You don't watch this team daily. You don't see all the great morale Gomez brings to that team and the fans all the time.  This team loves him. This city loves him.

So now I say not fuck Carlos Gomez, but  rather Fuck zeroesandones. Seriously dude get off your high-horse. 




 De Bruyne had the assist to Fellaini and the tackle that started that counter. He hasn't exactly had a bad match 




 Mance is the singer, Abel.  




 but...so what?  I don't really think that is relevant at all.   




 He's originally from the south. So there is hope 




 That bite kills him. Called it 




 Rorge and Biter kill the Hound maybe? 




 I was reading the Wikipedia page on the topic, and it essentially says in the 19th century their emerged texts claiming it, but there is no primary source to confirm it.

So the question is: What, if any, proof is there of it happening. AND why in the 19th century did this begin getting written about?

BONUS: If this is true...WHY THE HELL CAN'T I SALT THOSE DAMN CARTHAGIANS IN ROME: TOTAL WAR II????
