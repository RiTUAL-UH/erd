 So how's he manage 9 FTA per in the last 4 games of that series? If you're used logic holds true (Harden's aggression is proportional to the leniency of the refs on defenders), then he reverts back after the 3rd game when he attempted his season average FTA.  




 In case you didn't know, it's illegal to cook a human and James would never do that.  




 Is that because curry? Talk about clever. Harden's nickname should be Wet Cement (because it's something that hardens and most people don't have a penchant for watching it work). 




 How do you know he's not going to get the calls if he isn't putting himself in a position to force the foul? 

A classic "which came first, the kitchen or the chef?" 




 Might be because he wasn't driving. 




 He seemed un-motivated honestly. For one reason or another - whether injury, illness or just mental unpreparedness - he wasn't playing the aggressive and decisive basketball that generally propels his success. It was frustrating to watch but at the end of the day, he's just another dude trying to do stuff, and sometimes he'll come up short because of things., and I'm just a guy watching him try, so who am I to question that guy?

Bye.  




 You're super concerned with including your profession of your possession of the truth in all your comments. 




 Does Westbrook average 1-2 head flops a game too? He is averaging .2 FTA fewer than Harden but I haven't seen a single reference to his attempt numbers on /r/NBA. Or is that because all of his FTA are legit cookie butter? 




 It's sad that we view with contempt this man: his combination of speed and strength; his ability to penetrate  and expose defenses like the modern NBA edition of the Blitzkrieg; his acute awareness to force his opposition to resort to the desperate act of stalling - to foul.

Harden is magical... up until he gets fouled. Then it's drudgery. I get the criticism, but I don't like that getting fouled takes away from all of the other elements of his game.  




 Numbers can be ~~devolving~~deceiving, however. Harden was not playing aggressively at all in the playoffs last year. He was settling for a lot of bad and contested jumpers, and he wasn't attacking the basket and doing his FT collecting like he had been for a the majority of last season and this season. So while those numbers might support the narrative that "the refs clamp down on the playoffs", I believe there are more variables at play than that.

Harden gets more FTs when he is aggressive and attacks the basket, he gets less FTs when he settles for end-of-the-shotclock contested jumpers.  




 Well, he did stay. It makes sense:I mean, he is stand-offish, generally grumpy and mostly isolated in his own man-made slice of America; he is a genuine personification of the Great state in which he was raised.

The Texans have never won in Indiana. #dontcallitaqualifier 




 Why pathfind on new planets when you're already King of your own?

boring player 




 It's like how something like 80% of astronauts who have left orbit are from Ohio; Indiana produces a lot of people that really, really, really, want to get out of that state, no matter how hard the path. 




 I was already moored to my post. 




 YEAH BUT NO ONE WILL BE able to HOLD THEM. hehe 




 Yeah but we worship him with 100 million buckaroos. 




 Watt? Stop clowneying around, Houston willfork over a c ^r ushing and mercilous amount of pain on defense. I swearinger it. 




 Don't worry man, Houston has a lot of fucking pie. 




 Oh hey Gibbz, I've been listening to your music mucho mucho the past couple of days. Can we chill next time I'm in Brooklyn? 




 oh my gosh, oblivion? are you ok? 




 I think the one outside of F Bar resulted in the victim dying. 




 The best approach is to just devour it like praise until they stop feeding you.  




 Was this one of the back to back shootings in Midtown? Apparently the kids who did it were 15-16... Hope your friend recovers quickly. 




 In the playoffs to boot. Mark it down here. You don't just leave your team of 10 years, go their rival and expect to get a piggy back ride to the super bowl. Fate is going to fart on AJ so hard and it's gonna be so satisfying making it further than him and the colts this year.  




 Like a female God is ever going to let her windows get dirty. 




 The more words that tumble out of your mouth, the more God just shakes her head and wonders why you didn't quit while you weren't so far behind.  




 Moreyball is starting with Kevin Martin and Jeremy Lamb and ending up with Harden and Howard. Assets for all stars.

At least that's the business side of it.  




 Good list. Honestly though, any top houston songs list, without the queen of houston, beyonce, just isn't. Houston list. Thats a great best houston mostly underground w/ a little national break through songs list, though.   




 Earl Boykins passing to Muggsy Bogues between Yao Ming's legs. 




 Not black enough to scare us white folk though  




 Haven't heard of those, will check out thanks. Kind of the reason I made this post  




 Ha word. DJ Screw straight murdered that song on As The World Turns Slow.  




 I guess you're tougher than James Harden.  




 Not too familiar with blues. Care to throw together a Houston Blues beginners guide? 




 It was tough capping it at 15, and I tried to get a nice mix of my favorites + songs that put Houston music on the map... so that constrained me as well.

I like your list though, good representation of Houston Rap.

speaking of Houston Rap...

 http://www.amazon.com/Houston-Rap-Photographs-Peter-Beste/dp/193826505X

everyone who loves the underground rap scene in Houston should get this. 




 that's my jam though :p 




 There's a South Park Mexican verse on South Side Groovin :p 




 I changed it like an hour ago. The link I provided seems a little wonky.

Search spotify for "top 15 H-Town" and it should go to the most recent iteration. 




 I agree in concept, I would listen to mo city 10 times before wanna be a baller, but it's national pull necessitated the top spot IMO. Same reason damn it feels good made the list. Personally mo city don is the first song I think of when I think Houston music but I tried not to make it too personal of a list.  




 But Beyonc *was* DC.  




 yeah I think 'Welcome 2 Houston' will replace 'Still Tippin', good call. 




 I always try to establish a distinction between flopping (which I feel Harden rarely does) and selling a foul (which Harden utilizes and is good at). He may embellish illegal contact but only because *there is illegal contact*.  




 15 from houston (obviously hip hop heavy):

1) wanna be a baller

2) bang screw

3) mo city don

4) pepper

5) int'l players anthem

6) fondren   main

7) feeling good again

8) tops drop

9) drunk in love

10) damn it feels good to be a gangsta

11) if i needed you

12) la grange

13) south side groovin

14) halo

15) still tippin

 I bought signed Carl Landry shoes 3 days before he was traded for Kevin Martin. I feel your pain. 




 Yeah that's true, but you also don't want to put yourself in a position where your assets are a risk to your future.  




 They aren't losing him for nothing, they'll be losing him for flexibility. If they make an emotionally charged trade 'just to get value for him', they could potentially tie their hands behind their backs in the process. Sometimes it's better to lose something for nothing than to lose it for something worse than nothing. 




 He's still as raw as he was on the Rockets.  




 Do you know what genocide is? 




 The player option Dragic wanted was the biggest reason the Rockets didn't re-sign him a while back.  




 I don't reddit very often anymore. Actually did play basketball 3 times between you making that comment and me reading it.  




 genocidal

How do you figure?  




 no not really, i'm actually a pretty nice and considerate guy. really just thought it was a little bit funny and while it was obviously intended to be a joke about his race, I don't think substituting chop stick for fork is anything more than casually ignorant. i mean... we all laughed at the Jeremy Lin math video, but *how dare I* make a joke involving the utensils with which his people have historically consumed food???

i do apologize if i offended anyone; that was not my intention.

(I have 2 jeremy lin action figures after all, how *could* i be racist?) 




 stick a chop stick in him, he's done 




 And Lin!  




 I think it's funny that you are trying to play the "oh look at this guy acting all high and mighty card", when my reply was to you doing the same thing.  









 "congratulations, you're 3 days behind the rest of the world, time to catch-up..."

which is funny because the fact that you still listen to FM radio indicates to me that you're 3 years behind the rest of the world as far as music consumption goes. 




 Sam Presti. Bless his heart. 




 I can live with that. Happily.  




 For the East, yah, pretty decent. Don't really see how that makes him the MVP though. So he has the same win % while playing as Harden and worse than Curry, while playing in the East, and somehow that is supposed to be indicative of him being the MVP?

Guess I just can't see how that logically works out into a compelling argument. 




 Record without LeBron 2-8, with LeBron 28-12.

OK?

GS: Record without Curry 0-0, with Curry 39-8

HOU: Record without Harden 0-0, with Harden 34-14

 




 the end of that series tho :'( 




 Or maybe, seeing as how it's a vet clinic, it's another dog's semen. Whoa. 




 I wasn't the guy you replied to initially; I'm just an impartial observer.  




 9 months? Are you kidding me? It hasn't been too hot to be outside in 4-5 months and we still have 3-4 more to go.

Jesus you people are babies.  




 Dang you're obnoxious. I bet you just live for trite arguments like these.  




 It's not the heat but the humidity that kills you. The plus side is that for 4 months of extremely humid heat, you get about 6 months of really nice weather and 2 months of so-so weather. Also every building has AC so if you really can't stand it, it's easy to escape. 




 MFW it was a joke

-_- 




 Houston is absolutely not a terrible place to live. I mean, there's a reason it's one of the fastest growing major cities in the United States. Even if the reason is jobs and low cost of living, that alone makes it not a terrible place to live. I mean, it's by no means NYC or Miami or San Francisco in terms of 'vibrancy', but it's a pretty great city on its own merit. 




 We can't give him minutes because he's not on our team :-/ 




 You feeling a certain way doesn't automatically make it accurate. In this case your feelings aren't accurate.  




 10 seconds? Did you have to get out a pencil and check your work too? 




 So it makes him a good lion, and Mufasah was technically a bad lion. He allowed two other males to share his domain. Typically they'll kill even their own male cubs, let alone their weaker younger brother. 




 haha i addressed that in another comment. 




 Maybe he's just actually a tiger.  




 Woohoo! 




 Both statements are true.  




 Well I'm not in the shower anymore so obviously my argument will be inconsistent.  




 Yeah, it's easy to drink all the water when there isn't a source replenishing it because you're in the middle of a draught.  




 How are you certain of this? You're making baseless assumptions based on the disneyfication of the 'good' guys.  




 They drank all the water? How do animals drink all the water in a closed ecosystem? The hyenas/Scar were a scapegoat for the draught. If there wasn't a draught, hyenas and lions could have lived side by side in harmony. Scar saw this and while he was hungry for power, he at least didn't subjugate an entire species to the bad lands ( la Mufasah). 




 If Mufasah was such a great king, he wouldn't have allowed himself to be killed. And this is the animal kingdom we're talking about, where males constantly challenge each other for dominion of territory. Mufasah  Scar  Simba.  




 Too be fair, Mufasah was a bit of a prick to him. 




 i'm a pretty respectful guy but if you wear that you're fair game IMO... which is funny because tigers are generally at the top of their food chain (just dad joke things). i have an "only you can prevent narcissism" shirt which people take pictures of quiet often (without asking). doesn't bother me; do unto others and all that. you're never wearing tiger print pants and a tiger shirt to be inconspicuous is all I'm saying. 









 With socks while eating lox with a fox who has chicken pox? 




 i'm sorry :( 




 yeah he signed a consent form
 




 I stand corrected.  




 One of my legs is shorter than the other by a significant amount. 




 This was it. 




 tits 




 a finer poet houston has not seen 









 I thought it was funny but this comment makes me think it wasn't supposed to be a joke.  




 It's called a loss-leader. No, they don't make money on *that*, but *that* makes them money in the long term (customer enjoys themselves the first time due to the promotion, customer becomes regular customer, promotion works). And now there's a picture of their yogurt on the Internet being viewed by millions of people (which admitadly is only applicable if that yogurt place isn't a franchise).  




 You sound like a diva, bro. "Rodgers has a radio show and made fun of my player so he's a total diva!" 




 My buddy was one of the coders for it. 




 The app, Paper.  




 He also was a big part of the Thunder even getting to the finals In the first place... But people forget about that because he didn't carry them to a championship as a 21 year old 6th man.  




 And Kevin Martin!!! Hate Kevin Martin as a player and he was traded for my favorite player (Landry) but damn if he didn't help land us the current MVP.  




 No one? Not even Daryl Morey?  




 no one knows about it

Tells us about it 




 (I just woke up and the light was making me squint...)

Lol bullshit dude. If you're gonna blue steel your selfie just fucking own it.
