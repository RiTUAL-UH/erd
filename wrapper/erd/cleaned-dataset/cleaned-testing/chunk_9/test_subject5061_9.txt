 Anyone who thinks corporations are people is extraordinarily uneducated.

 Actually, the Democrats renounced overt racism in the 60's. Both parties are now not racist. See we can agree on something. 




 Nice anecdotes.  Can you explain the democrat party's long history of actual overt racism? 



















 Democrats supported slavery, imposed Jim Crow laws, opposed civil rights act, started the KKK, imposed segregation.

Now, tell me again why simply because the Democrats renounced overt racism in the 60's that that means the GOP is automatically racist?

Can you show what racist legislation or racist candidate the GOP supports?

 Damage control for Republicans? Why? What do they have to do with the shooting? BTW: Democrat Fritz Hollings put the Confederate flag on the SC statehouse lawn

"In 1962, during Hollings' term as Governor, the Confederate battle flag was flown above the South Carolina Statehouse underneath the U.S. and state flags where it would remain for thirty-eight years. In 2000 the state legislature voted to move the flag from above the Statehouse to a Confederate soldiers' monument in front of the building."

 Can you offer any proof of your claims?  




 Businesses expand when:

1. Demand increases

2. Have extra capital to diversify and enter new market with new goods or services.

3. Have extra capital to increase market share of existing market place (even if that market is in decline).

Money does not sit still. Extra profits are invested by the business itself or it is banked and the bank lends out capital to other businesses.  




 Have you ever owned a business? Most businesses set a percentage mark-up to sell a good or service over cost. If that mark-up is 40% then if your costs go up you raise prices to maintain that 40% mark-up. If all McDonald's and other fast food restaurants have to pay their employees nearly twice what they are being paid currently then they must raise retail prices to maintain their 40% profit margin.  Businesses will then turn to technology to perform jobs currently done by human workers. 

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/11/fast-food-robot_n_5668600.html 




 Businesses try to expand and  increase market share even when demand is constant. Take casinos for example. Almost every state is trying to open casinos. Is that in response to an increase in gamblers? No, it's an attempt to capture market share locally rather than allow gamblers to travel to states with existing casinos.  




 A higher minimum wage merely raises costs for businesses who in turn will utilize cheaper technology solutions. Businesses will also raise prices for their goods and services which will raise the prices for all products and services. What happens 2 years from now when the minimum wage is 15 per hour and a gallon of milk costs $10? Prices will catch up to wages and minimum wage workers will have the same buying power they have today. 





























 not every dollar spent on or by given entities have the same economic utility. 

Businesses that create jobs have a greater economic utility than giving away money through public spending. One creates JOBS while the latter simply gives away money that is dependent on  continued handouts 




 Demand can be created by giving the poor money via government spending or it can be created by making the cost of doing business less via less taxation and less regulation which allows business to expand and hire more workers, who will then spend more.


It all comes down to who one philosophically wants to give money to to stimulate the economy: business or poor people. I favor giving it to business because they will create jobs that will remain after the stimulus has ended. Giving money to the poor via public spending ends once the stimulus money is stopped. It's the old give a man a fish and he eats for a day, teach him how to fish and he eats forever scenario. Plus, in the real world, stimulus through government spending too often gives money not to the poor but to politically connected unions.   




 What I am saying, in the simplest way possible, is that both rely on an induced stimulus effect, either given to business or public spending. Liberals always claim stimulating the economy through tax cuts  is terrible but then they wish to stimulated the economy with public spending. This is nothing but a chicken and egg argument.  




 Sadly, yes... GHW Bush is a RINO. Republican In Name Only 




 I don't understand your point.... 




 You forget one key element: Giving money to the poor to stimulate economic growth last only as long as the poor are receiving money. When the spigot stops so does the increased demand. 

 




 You miss the whole reason businesses exist: to make money and expand if demand and the markets support expansion. If demand is increases then business will expand to meet that demand. If a business has extra money then it usually will expand to increase existing market share or venture into new business lines and products and services. Basic econ stuff here... 




 Reagan and JFK proved that Supply Side economics works. Romney is a RINO and a progressive 









 Sorry but you need to learn basic economics. If the poor are given money then they will spend and it will stimulate the economy. When business is given money via tax breaks that money gets invested in new business ventures or expansion. Money in tax havens protects that money from taxes. That money does not just sit there. It gets invested in new businesses or expand existing ventures. 

Have you ever taken an econ 101 class? 














 Sorry but there is no economic theory called trickle down economics. The Left uses the term as a pejorative and derogatory term for the economic theory known as Supply Side economics. The Left also uses the terms Voodoo economics and Reaganomics as similar derogatory terms. 

This is basic econ 101 stuff... 




 "Supply side" economics= lowering tax rates and lessening regulations to give business more money to expand and hire new workers.

Liberal Keynesian economics=using tax dollars for public works and public spending in order to give people more money that will increase demand and lead business to expand and hire more workers.

See? They are the same type of stimulus programs except for who gets the big stimulating chunk of money.

If one doesn't work then the other must necessarily not work either. This is simple econ 101 stuff here....   
 




 First off, there is no such economic theory called trickle down.

Second, if top down stimulus based economics is false then the Liberal government stimulus theory must also be wrong.

 You obviously are not educated. I realize that you were told in high school that the Nazis were "right wing" but what you failed to learn back then was that the soviets called the Nazis right wing because they were to the right of them politically on the socialist spectrum. 

Naziism was a combination of socialism and nationalism. Hitler was a devout socialist writer and political theorist. If you had ever taken a college level poli sci class you would have known that.  

The Nazis followed the socialist belief in government control over the means of production. Control does not necessarily mean ownership. It simply means control over privately owned industry. Again, if you had ever been to college you would know that....

  




 And why is that? The Nazis were socialists. Don't blame me because you are uneducated

 Obviously it is not impossible for a non elite QB to lead a team to Superbowl victory but realistically it is highly unlikely. Tannehill is competent but he doesn't scare anyone.

 Russell Wilson is elite. Kaepernick definitely not 




 QB not at elite level. It's that simple 






















































 You are missing the point. The fact that the Nazis were against the Marxists or Communists does not prove they were not socialists. The nazis were against the Communists because they viewed them as political rivals (and Hitler thought the Communists had too many Jewish members).

The Nazis' socialist roots are a historical fact. Rather than continue this fruitless exchange may I offer a suggestion? The study of socialism is a fascinating pursuit. At the turn of the 20th century, many political philosophers, especially in Germany, sought out to find the perfect socialist system. Many variations of socialism were envisioned. These variations maintained the core elements of classical socialism such as government (community) control over the means of production and distribution and a government (community) centric society at the expense of personal liberty.  Do you remember the movie Monte Python and the Holy Grail? That movie featured peasants that organized themselves as "Anarcho-syndicalists". That group was another of these socialist movements that tried to create a better form of socialism.  Naziism was another such improved socialist system.

Rather than argue, please simply study this extremely interesting period in political history and learn how others tried to add to and improve socialist theory.  




 After another 30 second google search:

Nazis were socialists:

http://jonjayray.tripod.com/hitler.html

Socialism allows for private ownership of industry during transitional phase:

http://www.stephenhicks.org/2009/12/04/economic-socialism-not-capitalism-section-8-of-nietzsche-and-the-nazis/

 














 You are straying from our discussion. Returning to our discussion, the Nazis were indeed socialists and their form of socialism, as is the case with other socialist systems, there exists a period before community ownership over the means of production that  allows for private ownership of industry. This refutes your claim that the Nazis were not socialist because they allowed for some industries to remain in private hands. 





























 
" the work is planned, financed and managed by the state; the directors of industry are appointed by the state and profits are considered the income of the state. Second, we find that a condition is defined as state capitalism (or state socialism) under which capitalist enterprises are controlled by the state. This definition is misleading, however, as there still exists under these conditions capitalism in the form of private ownership, although the owner of an enterprise is no longer the sole master, his power being restricted so long as some sort of social insurance system for the workers is accepted."

 It is truly sad that your worldview is so rigid that even when faced with historical proof, you simply can't evolve and assume dishonestly that I must be trolling you. That type of magical thinking is what children do to avoid reality. 

If you are indeed a serious adult then you really owe it to yourself to learn about the real world and not the world you create in your own mind. It is a historical fact that the Naziism and Fascism were types of socialism. People sometimes get confused because the Soviets considered them as their mortal enemies and it is assumed that that meant they were opposites politically. It is often stated that the Nazis were right wing but such claims are based on a comparison  on the socialist political spectrum. In other words, the Soviets considered the Nazis as right wing to themselves.  If the Nazis were placed on a political spectrum that included all major political systems then the Nazis fall squarely far left of center in the socialist systems.

Please simply study the various socialist systems created during the turn of the 20th century. Or you can simply pretend that your worldview is complete and accurate and live in a fantasy world. Good luck  




 I found this simple explanation after a 30 second google search:

Intermediate phases

The period in which capitalism becomes increasingly insufficient as an economic system and immediately after the proletarian conquest of the state, an economic system that features elements of both socialism and capitalism will probably exist until both the productive forces of the economy and the cultural and social attitudes develop to a point where they satisfy the requirements for a full socialist society (one that has lost the need for monetary value, wage labor and capital accumulation). Specifically, market relations will still exist but economic units are either nationalized or re-organized into cooperatives. This transitional phase is sometimes described as "state capitalism" or "market socialism".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_mode_of_production 




 You obviously have not read Marx. Marx stated clearly  that there are several steps societies must take before Communism is perfected. They start with agrarianism, enter industrialism (capitalism), move on to  socialism (which allows for private ownership of industry under government control) and then transforms  into Communism. 

If you studied Marx you would know these basic points. Perhaps you should study a little more before claiming to be a historian? 




 because the state places some economic restrictions on businesses

Some control does not equal total control as is required under socialism. Control does not necessarily mean out right ownership by the state, it simply means things such as the government controls access to raw materials, access to distribution, regulatory control, favoritism, , official exclusion of rivals etc etc 




 Hitler disliked Communists because he thought they were too internationally focused and contained too many Jewish members. As a socialist himself, Hitler considered the Communists and any other political party of any stripe as competition that had to be eliminated. 

In addition, socialists are historically incredibly pro-LGBT, anti-racist, and anti-conservative. Nazi's are conservatives with an anti-LGBT, clearly racist agenda.

Wrong. Can you provide any proof of your wishful claims?

In fact, Socialists were (and still are) among the most violent anti-fascists. 

Wrong again! Did you know that Fascism is also a type of socialism? You know, the part about control over the means of production and distribution and a government centric society at the expense of individual liberty? Did you also know that Mussolini was a devout socialist, was a prolific socialist author, and head of the Italian socialist party? 

I am curious, have you ever taken a college level history or poly sci course? 




 I think i will take Marx's view over your's
