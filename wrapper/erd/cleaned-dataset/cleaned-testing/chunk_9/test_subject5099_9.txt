 Well some of the maps are not in the works though, as they had critical flaws to them, if you happened to get this information for maps off the wiki, sorry for not updating that page recently, I had been doing it for a while. 




 Met Yetii during the gym, and she's my best and maybe only friend and I love her  ^ ^  




 Well, except that some of the maps you named were never added to the rotation, like arkansium and Elbe, etc 




 Bellows is one of my all time favorites, as well I did kinda like Plains, as boring as it was, but no molgan, NEVER molgan 




 GammeX^see^I'm^funny but seriously probably Del, Dans, and Audicy 




 i just preferred if the map makers did their own lore for the map they made, rightfully so. And you're welcome, i did my best! :P 




 a need for spacing became something much more beautiful in the end :P 




 were you looking to add in the lore to the map yourself? 




 Were you still looking to make the lore for the map when you get the chance? 




 I like it a lot! I'll edit a few grammatical errors in tense, but other than that I like the story!

Edit: I also used your screenshots from the original map thread for the slideshow, hope that's alright! 




 Well, I mean, the facts could be wro ng, but instead of telling me, why not change it yourself? :) The person that made the system for map lifespans made a basic one that works, but you could always change it! 




 Its stuff I came up with, and kinda just needed it to fill the space needed by the slideshows for each map. I suppose they can just be replaced by map showcases or something, just need it for formatting purposes. 









 And I do :/ 




 And I do :/ 




 And I do :/ 




 Just a quick correction, there were 4 heroes max in a default game 




 I just, feel so useless, that I'm not really good or even decent at anything, that I'm just shit at everything and only hurt people :/ 




 No, just, games I like are kinda lack luster as of late because all I want is to die :/ 




 Sandboxes are fun, I just wish I liked other stuff, I just don't like anything anymore, everything just turns to death for me :/ 




 well the glass on Hidden Valley only broke from Blaze Cannons, and after that it was just poor bedrocking, so if I do the Bedrock correctly, no worries 




 ~~I thought it meant that he wanted to lower the player count so a game starts every ten minutes, but you could be right as well.~~ edit: as well as not commenting to the right person, Rob and Nis proved me wrong on the most recent update. 




 The only difference between my pack and the DvZ one is the 32x32 textures, dunno if it would be that different. 




 It is, but I made this in a few hours, so hey, why not see if its worth redoing. 




 Well, it shouldn't look that different, the only difference between my pack and the DvZ one is the 32x32 textures. 




 Probably not, but its not that they're that important anyway. 




 The map essentially lacks two very, VERY important things, bedrock, and a front. I do realize that these two things are pivotal to the actual playing of the map, but I threw this together and just wondered if it was worth the hassle at all, so I'd like to know! 









 Shooters and Indies, sometimes open worlds, not much else though :/ 




 Just video games :/ 




 I just, dont have determination to be strong like that :/ 




 Just being worse and worse in my depressive state :/ 




 Just who I am is utter shit and I can't fix it. 




 I do enjoy the escape sleeping brings, but it can also bring terrible nightmares, I never have trouble sleeping, just hope I never wake up. 




 Distractions never really distract me, the feel comes back fairly quickly or while I'm doing the thing :/ 




 I honestly have very few people to talk to, and I'm just on the brink of giving out :/ 




 I just can't fix any of my own problems, no one can. 




 I just, don't want to be around anything anymore, I want to be how I feel, nothing.
 




 I do listen to them, all the time, but I never really can do much for them :/
 




 I think I'm going to smash my laptop though 




 I have, but more into the PvP stuff myself. 




 I like minecraft, but beyond that, it's just shooters and indies. 




 I'm not a big fan of sports, love video games though, really my only hobby. I watch doctor who and the walking dead as well. 




 Pretty much, except I get worse and worse as the process goes on. 




 I just, really don't have much to say, just want to die. 




 Many people cared, they all said they'd never leave me. They all left me, I am beyond hated. 




 Well, I am a bad person myself, and I cannot be forgiven. 




 I really don't think anyone could ever like me. 




 I just, always need someone to talk to, to the point I get annoyed if someone is doing something else and can't talk to me. That's why I understand I'm terrible, because it's wrong I get annoyed by that, people should do what they want, but I just can't stand being alone.

People that never met me dislike me, just, I guess because of my immediate impression. 




 All these people tell me they care about me, that they like me and say I'm a good person. Then, weeks, sometimes days gone by, they hate me, they like nothing about me. People that never really met me hate me, no one can stand how I am and what I do, and I only blame myself. I'm pushy and needy and everyone hates it. 




 I sit here, and I keep thinking of ways I can kill myself, I try my everything to find a way, and there have been several. I posted before, yesterday even, and I still have nothing but want to die. I'm still just sorry to all those people I hurt emotionally, and I hate how terrible a person I am. All I want, and all I need, is to die, the world would lose nothing by it. 




 I honestly cannot have a friendship or relationship with anyone, I'm just that terrible. 




 I have gone to a hospital once, I only found it to drive myself worse. I never find hope for anything in the world, and I'm tragically ironic. I dislike most people, I like few, they become my reason for the world, and then they hate me because of how I am, and I'm terrible. I have been this way for years, and I honestly just give up, and I'll figure out a way to fix it.  




 I am not, in any way, a good person. Everyone tells me that the first time they see me, everyone tells me they were wrong in a very short time. 




 But nothing would ever smile back at me, I do nothing but drive people to anger. 




 This post is more located here for the fact I can't put it in a place people know me because it would be rude and against guidelines.

I've posted here before, I've given up before, and I find no guarantee I will kill myself today, but I sure really want to and will think of a way to. I don't find hooe in the world, as I'm lonely and destructive in friendships, and most people end up hating me. I'm sorry to all those that I hurt, especially her, and I'm sorry that I was such a stupid ugly person that only annoyed others.

I'm sorry. 




 Its nice that guys like you exist, and are able to be a light of friendship and hope to others, when some of us just, have no hope left, like myself :'/ 




 I sadly have, just never works out, and I always ruin it, whether I try to change or not :/ 




 Just happens people dont like my company. 




 It comes back to that thing where I feel like I hurt people more than I could give them. :/ 




 No, not really, I just play by myself :/
