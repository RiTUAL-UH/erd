 Nah, their HQ will burn down due to the One M9s before they go bankrupt... 




 Paperman was pretty good. 




 I started with my Maths and Physics classes... Junior college not started yet. 




 XD. The weather here is getting gloomier due to rains :( 




 So, are you planning to sleep today? 




 Which games did you buy? 




 Heavy rains here... The only thing that I did today was atching a movie. How was your day? 




 3.44pm here... 




 What's the time at your place? 




 Yes, it looks amazing! Finally a good Pixar film after 5 years. 




 inside Out is releasing on the 26th in my country :( I am definitely going to see it, though! 




 I am very excited for Finding Dory, too! 




 I love Finding Nemo, too. It's just amazing. 




 My favourite would always be Toy Story 3, for the nostalgia. I've never seen The Road to El Dorado, though... 




 Yes, they did announce Incredibles 2, and I am super-excited for it! I am a huge fan of animated movies, and also a big fan of Pixar movies. Which is your favourite animated movie? 




 It's my favourite Science Fiction movie. I am also going to rewatch The Incredibles today. 




 I watched Wall-E today after many years. I love that movie. 




 The Heads-up notifications in Android 5.0 were a complete mess, and I hated them. The implementation in 5.1 is much better.  




 It's releasing on the 26 in my country :( Can't wait for it! 




 Which distro are you using? 




 Petition to add DuARTe's daughters to the list of Approved Daughters. 




 Yes, the JP callbacks were good... 




 I saw JW, but I personally thought that JP1 was much better. I am a lot more excited for Inside Out.

 Redditing, and sometimes, watching animated movies. 




 Truth! 




 Most of them are incredible. 




 All Pixar movies.  




 [Yes, you can make it at home.](http://www.boldsky.com/cookery/vegetarian/break-fast/bun-maska-recipe-030880.html) 




 Yes, it's very tasty! If you ever come to India, you should definitely try it. 




 [Yes.](http://www.rajkotfoodie.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/brun-maska.jpg) 




 [Someone else has the same name as you.](http://i2.cdnds.net/13/10/618x448/movies-disney-film-feature-6.jpg) 




 Come after your work is done! 




 Sure! Come to India! 




 Bun and butter. It's an Iranian dish found in Iranian cafs in India, and the bun has loads of butter put on it. 




 I am having lunch right now. 




 Because it's 1pm here in India. 




 "I go." One of the most emotional scenes in the movie. 




 Even I still have kept my toys in the bedroom. They were a big part of my childhood, and mean a lot to me. And after watching TS3, I don't have the heart to throw them away. 




 The ending is just amazing, always gets me. 




 Toy Story 3 and Up. Also, The Iron Giant. 









 I started to read Redwall by Brian Jacques. 




 One of the best comments!

This is not /r/AndroidMasterCard! 




 You need to see JP1. It's incredible! 




 I saw it in 3d. I found the movie to be okay. Jurassic Park was better, IMO. 




 What makes you think all Indians here are poor?  




 CC, androidcirclejerk, android. 




 Pixar's best? This is getting me seriously hyped! 




 Nothing yet. 




 [I collect a few of them, but they aren't close to what you've got.](http://imgur.com/rAdfOql) 




 The ending of TS3 always gets me. 




 The first 10 minutes of Up. 




 Thanks! 




 It's a Linux based distro, widely regarded as one of the easiest to use distros. 




 No. I am using Ubuntu. 




 [A screenshot of my desktop :)](http://imgur.com/1A5dY1y) 




 Studying :( 




 Spiderman 2 was awesome. Much better than the Amazing Spiderman series. 




 The ending of Toy Story 3. 




 Mine is The Incredibles.

 Sheriff Woody! 




 Time for our beloved AutoMod to reach there. 




 This one's only the second flair I've ever had, so I've never had a witty flair. 




 I didn't really like the trailer of the good dinosaur, though. 




 But I heard the movie was about Finding Dory's roots, her parents and finding about her childhood... At least that's what I heard... Incredibles2 could be great as well. 




 Inside Out looks amazing, but it's releasing one week late in my country, on 26th :'(



Also, the script of Finding Dory looks good, too... 




 *cough cough* Cars 2 *cough cough*



I am super-excited for Inside Out, though. 




 Even the ending of TS3 was very emotional. 




 The first 10 minutes of the movie were too damn emotional. 




 Yup. I love the movie. I love almost all of Pixar's movies. 




 what's up?

^^^Just ^^^kidding
 




 Not using Chrome OS.



**MAWDS!** 




 The IMEI sticker should be removed immediately. The no. is not for others to see. 




 Thanks! 




 Will try to do at least 20 today! 




 Praise DuARTe! 




 The Indominus Rex is funded by Verizon and it also has a "Samsung Innovation Center". 




 Thanks! And I don't think I would ever be able to do 120 Push-ups in a day. 




 I cycled almost 8km yesterday for the first time! Feeling great :) 




 I never got into gaming... 




 Almost all of them. 




 The Iron Giant? 




 The Indominus Rex shown in the movie is also funded by Verizon. 




 No... I didn't see such things... 




 Flappy Bird. 




 Goa, India. Yes, it was an enjoyable experience! 




 Not an early bird, not a night owl, as it's 6pm here :P 




 Hi, what's going on? 




 India. 




 Asia, as I'm an Asian :) 




 Truth! 




 What about Inside Out? 




 I just had rice for dinner. 




 [Here.](http://imgur.com/x0PGxSi) Sorry for the delay! 




 In going out for half an hour, I will be back soon and will surely upload one. 




 Yes, wait... I'll have to upload one. But they're not good :P 




 Yes, wait... I'll have to upload one. But they're not good :P 




 Cartoons :) 




 I've been fine, I started a bit of drawing recently

 Hi, missed your panda drawings! 




 Me too! 




 Charizard :D 




 Loving Pokemon!

#BuyANexus 




 Yeah, right. :( 




 What right do they have to say that? 




 Anyway, I won't be returning to the class. 




 That's what I thought in the end, "Thank God I didn't take admission here." 




 She was the person running the class.
