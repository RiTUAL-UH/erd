 She might be ugly. 




 Absolutely, as long as there was a second girl involved. 




 The autism is posting screencaps from videogames saying things that are blatantly untrue in an attempt to make themselves feel less sad over the death of a man who they've never met. 









 No, you wanted karma. 




 This is retarded. Yes, technically bodies decompose and release their chemicals into the air. However, for it to 'scatter across the cosmos' it would have to leave Earth in the first place, and it won't. And even if it does... so what. It's just a bunch of chemicals. It's no more meaningful than one of his broken nails decomposing to feed a plant.

And he's definitely not watching over us, that's just retarded. He's a fucking corpse in the ground and his neurons stopped firing. 




 So is the black one a chick or a guy? 




 Have you ever banged two girls at once? 




 Who was the guy who made it through with a Svengali Deck?

 




 Do you have to tell a producer back stage how your trick is done before showing it to P T? Or can you just claim they're wrong with no one to call you out on it? 




 That's plenty of time tbh. Pick any nearby building that looks like it would have a back exit. Take a few seconds to get inside. Hulk had no idea which one you went into. You're already in a back alleyway by the time he even searches one building  









 haha imagine if he went to hell though and every time he tried to program devils put things in his butt :-/ that would be sad!! 









 Two products flop and he has to take a pay cut to please the board of directors. Yes, what a great 'innovator'. 




 lol 




 This would be a successful TIL a week ago. 




 Very often.

In fact, I'd say in most companies the CEO has industry experience.

Most of the big name CEOs that inherited their wealth or cross sell to industries they know nothing about are in the minority. There's are thousands upon thousands of companies around the world and most would hire CEOs that know what they're doing. 




 Because he's dead? 




 Where'd he go? 




 It was the first game that used it, perhaps it's ironed out the problems since then. 




 Each sperm is different (some combination of 50% of the fathers DNA). Otherwise, siblings variance would be determined solely by the mother. 




 DON'T JUDGE ME 




 This isn't a 'theory', it's just an idea. 




 I think it's fair enough to say that delaying sex for 10 minutes will cause a different child to be born. Imagine the semen would have changed position (and that's just one variable) and therefore a completely different set of sperm would have survived and a completely different one from that set would have fertilised the egg. 




  Lol, no animal is "meant" to be ridden by any other animal.

The one exception being your mother. 




 Unless there person is in the room with you and you mean mimicking them in real time, in which case I'd just say you're "copying" them. 




 Impersonation I suppose. Impression generally refers to mimicry for entertainment, whereas impersonation is much broader. 




 So there's a database our there that knows about my fetish for naked females??? 














 That's the point of the thread bro 




 Imagine if Heath Ledger's performance wasn't quite as good. The script is kind of ass. 




 I don't think he was a sociopath, just didn't know how to innovate Nintendo's franchises 




 Pretty much this. Any movie can cure boredom if you're in the mood for that particular type of movie. 




 I don't think your analogy holds up since we're yet to see a general with supernatural powers. I think if we did, he'd definitely be remembered.

Hell, we still remember Jesus. 




 Yup, went quite young. This is all well and good news, but unless Nintendo seriously attempts to capitalise on his death and take the opportunity to innovate instead of rehashing, it will probably all be for naught. Let's hope the next CEO isn't quite so stuck in the past. 




 "HUGH HUGH HUGH HUGH HUGH"

Holy shit that was awkward.

Honestly, was it performance art? I feel like it deserves its own post. 




 Sorry pumpkin, how much time do you need to mourn before I can ask this question? 




 If everyone laughed it wouldn't be cringe.

If no one laughed it and sat there silently it is cringe.

It's not the behaviour that makes something cringey per se, but the reaction it illicits and knowing what it might feel like to be in that persons shoes. 




 What the fuck is wrong with you people, it's just some dude. I'm genuinely curious to know where Nintendo is going to head and I thought this board would be full of insights. 




 It's a legitimate question. It's not like his family is reading this. And people die all the time, I don't need to care everytime it happens. 














 Do we really need a scan of Lois referring to Clark Kent as Clark Kent and Superman as Superman? 




 Decent joke but predicted the punchline almost immediately. Could use some retooling 




 Banned. 




 Banned. 




 Looks cool, doesn't make the movie any less of a boring action movie though  




 Unlikely 




 Yeah, let's enable fat fucks! 




 What about The Joker? 




 Hitler dud nothing wrong 




 Awful  




 These are pretty clever, let me try!

What's brown and looks like a piece of shit?

A black person 




 I think you missed part of your story. Why were the police there? Where was your dad? Was your mom fucking the other cops or something haha 




 The complaint is variety, not realism. 




 Seems like horizontally is almost always better, and feels more comfortable too since you can stabilise it with two hands more naturally. 




 Ah, the wrong one! 




 I don't understand why actresses wear makeup

For even more visual stimulation. 




  FPH literally couldn't say anything except found the fatty

In seriousness, what do you expect them to say? 




 Unlike the members of that audience. 




 I'm sure he's keeping his numbers up too 




 Just make his abilities use Anti-mana 




 Lol it's pretty funny when you realise that Clark Kent and Superman are played by the same actor  




 But why  




 Who says the AI is operating as intended? 




 Dank memes. 




 Yes! 




 What about Lambert? Can you still play cards with him if you spare Karadin? 




 Probably as simple as it's easier to lie on the Internet then for the events to have occurred. Then, of course, even when the events are based on real facts - people embellish those in real life where they CAN be contradicted, so it's almost definitely happening with even the mostly true Internet stories. 




 They weren't working properly? 




 You missed 




 Me too. 









 It's deliberate 




 Better than 50k a month alimony. 









 Such as? 




 Yeah, with them all telling him his new ideas are wrong. That guy was chasing dead ends at the end of his life 




 That movie was my first date with my now ex. We just broke up. Feels time 




 I'm going to take the unpopular opinion and say that he's liked because it's popular to like him. People who don't like him get downvoted anyway so you don't even see the occasional comments from people who don't find him funny.

The circlejerk didn't even start until Zombieland anyway, which pretty forced the opinion that Bill Murray is amazing on the audience. 




 The Internet is afraid of me... I have seen its true face. Reddit are extended gutters and the gutters are full of year old memes and when the drains finally scab over, all the vermin will drown. The accumulated filth of all their Pepes and feels guys will foam up about their waists and all the memeologists and danklords will look up and shout "Save us!"... and I'll look down and go (   ) 




 I'm Mormon 




  While I agree that it would be difficult to regulate

It really isn't. At least not in Australia. 




 It's not entirely fair to compare the effects of legalising prostitution in one country to another, BUT, in the first world countries where it is legal, the work conditions actually seem pretty good and it doesn't seem like anyone is being taken advantage of.

Completely legal in my country and I have a friend who is a friend with a prostitute and says she loves her job and so do her coworkers. 




 Try asking on /r/askhistorians

They'll probably give you a complete rundown on the evolution of date formatting. 




 I'm certainly not because I don't give a shit. 




 Probably because of the theme. We've seen Batman vs Anarchistic villains a dozen times by now.

This is the first live action film to show Batman trying to take down another hero, and a hero significantly more powerful then him. It's Batman vs a God. It's Batman doing what he believes is right and, for once, might actually clash with the audiences views. 




 Damn that car is shiny. 




 You will

Literally spoilers in the trailer. I'm not even bothering to see the movie now. 




 I thought the same thing when I read the title.

Know what I did next? This might shock you.

I READ THE FUCKING ARTICLE. Literally the first paragraph doofus. 




 Those movies were released a year apart. It's kind of difficult to say that superhero films where on the brink of oblivion and the success teetered on Blade. I'm pretty sure even if Blade bombed people would still be interested in whatever superhero movie came after that.

I don't think a small handful of bombs have ever killed an entire genre. 




 Just a quick one today folks. I was going through my daily watching of The Dark Knight Rises and noticed something in the end credits. If you look closely at the center of the screen, eventually you will see some white characters appear against the black backdrop. I took a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/8nsconP.png) on youtube to assist.

If you can make out the white characters, it appears to say something along the lines of "Executive Producers - Benjamin Melniker and Michael E. Uslan"

I believe this is a possible hint towards the identity of two of the executive producers who worked on the movie, one of which is Michael E. Uslan. It's possible that this Benjamin Melniker is also an executive producer but I haven't quite finished analysing that part of the text.

And before anyone asks how I managed to notice such a detail, it's because I have a PhD in film studies (currently doing my thesis on The Dark Knight Rises, specifically about Batman's identity - which I believe to be Bruce Wayne). 




 Free *weekly* **expansions?**

Not even CD Projekt is this generous. 




 I don't hate movies because of plotholes. 




 I didn't make assumptions. I admit complete ignorance one how is friends perceive him. I offered potential alternatives - not to state that those are true, but 

Me: ***Maybe*** they like it (the alternative being that maybe they don't, I have no idea).

You: You **should** reevaluate your definition of personal space. I'm **sure** you've made them uncomfortable and didn't even realize there, Rico.

In my circle, this kind of interaction is pretty normal and is just as often the girls getting close and playful as the guys.

Sometimes I feel like Reddit is full of prudes. 




 Completely agree. I don't feel like side quests or exploration are even a distraction like I do with most games, they feel worth doing. I didn't think they could top The Witcher 2 so well, but this game blows it out of the water. Not to mention [spoiler](#s "Bruce Wayne is Batman"). 




 Bruce Wayne is Batman. 




 Yes.

They don't care. The audience doesn't care/know. 




 I'm sick of seeing this comment. 




 Damn Yeezy is beautiful. 




 Seriously what century are we living in, your assumption is that he is always the one getting 'handsy' and they are all secretly awkward. Maybe they like it? Maybe they're handsy back? Maybe that's just normal in his circle? 




 Eh, I'm the same with female friends as bigfatty but they initiate it as much as me. Actually, probably more, since I'm secretly crushing on half of them and deliberately 'hold back' so my girlfriend doesn't know. 




 One bite? Prick 




 Can be stories, pics, whatever 




 Did your son have any rare Pepes I can have? If you don't want them of course 




 Nice 




 A) He is omnipotent. He could have done it in one day, so why did He take seven (plus rest???).

B) Days didn't exist before the Earth was created anyway so it doesn't even make sense. 




 Am I the only one that just likes the idea that nobodies perfect and he just bumped his head? 









 [Spoiler](#s "His plans nearly come to fruition")

[Spoiler](#s "His cloud burst is beaten almost immediately after he launched it. He gave civilians enough warning to leave the city when he could have literally had innocents (instead of thugs) clawing eachothers eyes out. Remember, this all takes place over the course of a single night, the cloudburst was active for, what, 30 minutes?")

[Spoiler](#s "So after the cloudburst, then what? The Arkham Knight was employed solely to deal with Batman, yet he went off the rails and lost miserably in any actual fights where Batman's death was an option.")

[Spoiler](#s "Finally, though, he captures Batman. Now what? Inject him with your fear toxin... which doesn't work. It just straight up didn't work. Not that Scarecrow could have known, but it didn't.")

[Spoiler](#s "The game does a good job of tricking you into thinking Scarecrow's plan was a lot closer to being successful then it ever was, but when you realise how small the timeframe is, you realise that every step of his plan was thwarted within an hour of him attempting to go through with it.") 




 Are tags stored on your PC or does RES store them on their servers? Ie. if I moved to a new computer, would my tags carry over? 




 Let's say I have 20% Igni intensity on one sword and 10% Igni on another, do I get 30% all up? 




 Have you got a source for this, or is this just speculation? 




 Yes, my ex-girlfriend. I mostly drink water and we're both reasonably fit, but she drinks probably 3-4 diet soft drinks a week. 




 I started a Signs based build because I didn't realise how easy it was to replenish potions (thought I'd be using them too sparingly to bother putting points in that tree). However, after realising their are restored by alcohol I've been using them a lot and I'm thinking of respecing into an Alchemy build. I don't like bombs, so I'm thinking of doing the following build:

http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/skill-calculator/?combat=115 sign=153 alchemy=115_125_143_225_252_323_345_415 general=321

Some explanation:
-Deliberately didn't max some skills
-Muscle Memory to 5/5 (just for a bit of extra damage)
-Delusion to 3/3 (just for a bit of a boost of stamina + dialogue options)
-Not interested in using bombs, I'd rather stick to a signs build if bombs are necessary for an Alchemy build to work
-Would place Synergy with a strong red mutagen
-Rage management to help keep Quen up
-Skipped delayed recovery as potions should already last a long time
-Refreshment I'm on the fence about as Swallow already will last a long time with this build
-Frenzy just sounds obnoxious to use, so I skipped it
-Oils seems good all round, but I'm skipping the last skill because I feel like my adrenaline will be used for the occasional sign due to my playstyle.
-My remaining two slots would likely go to a point or two in a sign skill, or maybe some of the yellow skills, but honestly, I don't know if I'm liking to reach this level on a single playthrough due to how slow leveling is. 




 She kept the lipstick at the end. Was it a 'joke' that she was offering lipstick? Was there any intent to actually give them to him?

 You're wrong, but ok 




 You said evidence, not proof.

Evidence typically just means something supporting a view. 




 I think his point is it's sad to find out that someone like this is guilty of such crimes. 




 Did your friend chip in for the fridge? If not, (and the fridge isn't nice), your cheapest bet is getting a cheap padlock hinge and a padlock and putting it on your main fridge. Much cheaper than buying a minifridge or a safe. Just get one that only requires small screws so you're not drilling through the door.

Seems a little strange, but seriously, your friend sounds like a prick. It's absolutely absurd that you've already asked him to stop and he's still doing it. That's the kind of behaviour I'd expect from someone under 12.

 There are almost no sports where women can even approach the level men can compete at, let alone provide actual competition to the world's best.

Sport after sport, the world's top women fall short of men that aren't even competing in the highest leagues. 




 And yet there are non-hateful religious people, hence his statement is still wrong, no matter how ingrained hatred is in many sects of religions. 




 He'd have to learn a new language to communicate. Unfortunately, since we hear things in English, it's hard to say whether the way they speak is in a manner following patterns that humans (even a human genius) could pick up. If so, I think this would be the first thing he applies himself to learning and would accomplish some fluency eventually. 




 Tony Stark was able to build this. In a cave! Surrounded by Ewoks! 




 Hi, I'm a complete nobody with no reference or past experience I can point to, I can build you a death suit if you give me access to your technology that I don't even understand yet!

That'll work... 




 Current Kyle Massey and Michael Cera. George Michael is as at the end of Season 3 of AD and Corey Baxter is at the end of Corey in the House (videogame is not canon for the purposes of this fight).

They fight in a boxing ring. Fight is no weapons, to the death. Which team comes out on top? 




 His "mmmmm" at 3:02 sounded like Marge Simpson. 




 She mispoke and said Forcecaster instead of forecasters, confused Star Wars and Star Trek in trying to recover, and confused the Vulcan salute with a Nazi salute.

 I don't like her, but she's not saying she doesn't care or others shouldn't care.

She's criticising the liberals for caring about fast food wages even though (she, for some reason, believes) they want to eliminate fast food and make everyone go vegan. 




 But they'd likely be too expensive per unit to be highly marketable. 




 Read the first paragraph, they don't know who Tony is 




 Yes, but we're talking about Superman's motivation to fly in the opposite direction once he had rewound time. If it's a 'visual representation', there is nothing special about Superman flying in one direction around the Earth to allow him to go forward in time vs back in time, yet it syncs perfectly with the movement of the Earth (the visual representation).

This makes no sense, unless Superman knew an audience was watching and wanted to sync his spinning with the Earth's visual representation for some reason. 




 Is this still happening?
