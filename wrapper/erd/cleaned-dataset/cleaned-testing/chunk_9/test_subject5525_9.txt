 It's a little weird the first time or two, but what isn't? One of the best ways to communicate sexually is to share masturbation techniques. It shows how you like yourself to be touched and loved, and the person that you care about can learn that from watching you. 

I would and have done it. 














 Because art?
 




 Look up OAT (Off Axis Torque) on your Google machine. That's kinda what it sounds like to me. 
























 Are you kidding? Kathleen Turner as horny godzilla woman was amazing! I loved her character. I see what you mean about too much Runkel, but I loved Turners heavybreathing ass!
 




 Such an excellent series. I waited far too long to watch this. The seasonal guest stars are amazing, the writing is clever, love this series.

Except for the end. Really? Really? I won't ruin it, but just really? 




 Depends on how much of the bartenders time you took. Busy bar, and all the tender did for me is get the beer and open it? Twothree bucks is fine. Slower night, and I sit at the bar and the tender chats with me? I'll tip a couple more dollhairs for the company. 



















 My dad's dad died in WWII, but my mom's dad was around when I was a young man.

He was also a WWII vet, came home and opened a shop that sold and repaired volkswagens. Eventually, as he and grandma got older, the shop got to be too much and he sold it.

Not one to sit on his ass doing nothing, he looked for another line of work. He got hired on at our local Veterans hospital as a special ambulance driver. (He transported special cases from hospital to hospital, met organ donations at the airport, occasionally bringing a dead vet back home to their family.) 

He mainly worked in between Atlanta and St Petersburg, and over time, he started spending more and more time away. I was only twelve or so when this started but I remember conversations my mom and her mom would have about him being gone so long. They said it was part of his job...he would stay in Atlanta until they needed him to drive to St Pete and then he would be home again for awhile.

Eventually, the time away got to be more and more significant, and then he just didn't come home.

The whole family was very hushhush about it, I don't remember hearing much....until the shit hit the fan.

After much pressure from my Mom, my grandma finally called up the vets hospital in Atlanta to find out what had happened to her husband. I wasn't there for the phone call, but I like to imagine the very long pause, and then whoever she was talking to asking exactly who wanted to know. (I've heard all this second hand) When she explained that she was his wife, she was put on hold. Eventually someone else picked up the phone and started giving her hell for making a call like this, and how inappropriate it was, and how the Veterans Hospital didn't appreciate jokes.

Finally, my grandmother was told that her husband had passed away about eight months prior.

The reason they were so incensed at her calling....

My grandfathers wife worked at the Veterans Hospital as a nurse, and was well known and liked.

Yep, my grandfather had two complete families. Neither knew of the other until he passed. We (on our side) have reached out to them (on her side) and have made some connections. I'm excited to have so many new family members!

Short aside; I remember hearing a conversation between my mom and my grandma about maybe going up to Atlanta to meet the family, or at least visit the gravesite, and grandma was fairly blase about the whole thing...it really didn't seem to bother her. After my mom pressured her, she finally broke down and showed a little anger, the first time I'd ever seen real strong emotion from her.

Her anger wasn't about the second family. Or the lies. Or the time apart. Or anything that really mattered.

She was furious that his other wife was black. (We're not)

I'm sorry I can't share a funny or uplifting story about a grandpa for you, but maybe this one made you smile, and hopefully your PopPop had a long and eventful life full of great stories.

 Stop worrying about how you *should* feel and find out how you *do* feel. It was consensual, and you both knew what the expectation was going in. Did you have fun? Do you feel like anyone was cheated or lied to or misconstrued? 

I have had about equal sexual encounters; both brief and in LTR. As long as I have been honest with myself and my partner, I never felt any negativity about any situations, and I don't think that you should either. But each man has to explore his own emotions, and come to terms with what he feels. (Not with what he should feel.) 




 Thank you for sharing your story. We need more like you to stand up and point out the problem. We're at a tipping point right now, where I think we can still save the idea of community policing as a positive thing, but if we wait too long, it may be too late to ever have the communities trust the police that try to keep them safe. 














 Those were dark days indeed. 

Friends with older brothers who had access to Playboy...or the occasional Hustler. Game changer right there.

A little later in teenage years, porno vids, on VCR tapes at that, that would get passed around. 

Also, hard to believe now, but when you couldn't get access to nekkid girls, you'd wank to anything close. Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition, National Geographic, underwear ads in the JCPenny circular; back in my day you just had to make do with what you had.  









 I don't think the author was trying to shame anyone for valid safety decision making...I do try to let our kids have as much freedom as I can stand, but that's only because I have canvassed the neighborhood, I know most of the folks here, quiet roads, no open bodies of water, checked the child molester websites, tested the childrens safety knowledge, set strict limits on wandering, and remove permissions when rules are broken. The goal is to keep our children safe, but not to let our need for safety override their need for space, when said space is attainable and safe. I hope no one here is feeling shamed for making right decisions for their children. 




 No judgement here....but the article points out an interesting phenomena...our children are denied the freedom that we (most of us) had in a more dangerous world, and I agree with the author in that it may leave our children without valuable learning, memories, and experimentation. It's an op-ed piece, and it is designed to change peoples minds, not to judge decisions that they have made. 




 Yeah, I was riding my bike about 10-15 minutes or so by grade 4. 




 Go. Always.

There is this strange fascination with making sure that our kids are at school everyday...like that's the only way to learn anything. Your child won't fall behind because you guys spent three days on vacation. The experience is part of the learning process, as well. (My wife and I often argue about how much time I want to keep the kids out of school. If there is a rocket launch, or a guest speaker at the library, or an art show, or a guided nature walk....these things seem more valuable to me than organized schooling....saying all this with the assumption that your child is a good student and caught up.)

GO.  














 Be safe, OP 




 Hate that shit, man. Feels. *fistbump, buys shots.

People like that make the rest of look stupid. 




 Great question.

Short answer: Yes, completely safe, assuming the food was handled correctly before cooking.

Here's why. Potentially hazardous foods (like, raw meats, poultry, and eggs) have the potential to harbor harmful levels of microorganisms when handled incorrectly. (They're already present in our food) We can kill most, if not all, these microorganisms in our food with the application of heat, cooking it. So what happens when you get raw egg on your spatula? You use that same spatula to stir the eggs, while heat is being applied, and to flip those eggs, while heat is being applied, and to serve the eggs, while heat is still being applied, or ambient heat is still present. Anything present on that spatula has been cooked along with the product being cooked. So, completely safe, because of safe temperature management. But, consider this. You pull out your ground beef from the fridge early because it is still slightly frozen. It sits on your counter for a few hours before cooking. You use the fork to cook and serve the ground beef. You set the fork on the counter and then enjoy your yummy tacos. A few hours later, wanting a little desert, you get your flan out of the fridge, and not thinking about it, use the fork you set on the counter to eat the flan. That has the possibility of getting you sick, because of poor time management.

Not all the microorganisms get killed by cooking; instead, consider cooking food, to appropriate temperatures, a way of ensuring that there is a safe level of microorganisms in your food (i.e. at a level that your body's defenses aren't overwhelmed). While the fork sits on the counter at room temperature, microorganisms are growing. More means a higher likelihood of a negative reaction to those microorganisms.

In these examples, it's mostly just a matter of time. While cooking your eggs, you could totally just lick the raw eggs of your fingers, and be fairly confident in that not putting you in danger. Not washing your hands after touching raw eggs, and giving those microorganisms enough time to reproduce turns your hand into Typhoid Mary, infecting everything it comes in contact with. 




 I've always found GOP Women in Congress revolting! Hahahaha...

But seriously, two things here. Can't believe that we're still going on about this whole thing, and second, it's interesting that the GOP (revolting) women (seriously, have you even seen any of them? Gross) are splitting, not because of these draconian laws, but because they might lose votes? Maybe that should tell you something about the nonsense you are trying to pass.  



















 Six hours at room temp? And it wasn't frozen? Toss it. Just not safe. If it was not chicken, then maybe you could work with it, but fuck salmonellosis. 




 Hadn't seen that one. Have you seen *Frozen Lincoln Saw Her Snatch*? A very cold car falls in love with one women's vagina after peeking through her window. 









 Check out the site, people aren't posting giant stories of their lives. Just one or two lines sometimes, mentioning what they had for lunch, or asking a question about their target language. Great real world practice, though from a spanish students POV, a bit frustrating. I'll post something, be told I did a great job by someone from Mexico, and then corrected heavily by someone from Argentina, and then a user from Spain corrects him...lol. 




 Love working the two together. For more advanced learning, also check out fluentu.com, a video based learning site. Watch youtube videos in spanish while reading subtitles and then study words and phrases you've learned. Also like lang-8.com, a sort of social media platform where you post in your target language and native speakers come and correct you and engage you in conversation. In return, you correct students trying to learn your native language. 




 The only way that I find motivation to learn is to find a way to apply that learning in the real world. I've been successful at learning spanish because I have real world friends that I can practice with. I share trivia on some message boards online, and with friends over drinks. Without real world applications it does become an exercise in futility. 




 Depends on the GC type and restaurant policy.

VISA (and other) backed cards are treated like debit cards and can be tipped off of.

Restaurant cards (branded, without VISA (or other) backing) are subject to individual policy. The restaurant I work in currently, and a few others that use that magstripe type GC do not allow you to tip. It should say something on the back that might clue you in, or you could call the restaurant. 




 I'm a self learner. On top of my daily rummaging through news sites and trivia dumps, I am on my second year of Spanish on both duolingo.com and memrise.com; I am just finishing an astronomy course that I found through edx.org; and I'm excited to be starting a course on songwriting and lyrics through coursera.org

I like to learn.  














 Can't answer for everyone, but I can answer for me.

I like it. Play with it, apply pressure to it, rub it, lick it. It makes me happy. (I am a pro-prostrate hetero male, though) Going in blind, as it were, can be dangerous, as lots of dudes are real butthole sensitive, so tread with caution. 









 I'm 42, she's 36. Together over 15 years, kids, house, jobs, the whole deal. Last night was oral for her on the craft room table, twice, plus a good fisting, then a BJ for me outside on the patio, followed by PIV and then anal to finish. Nothing special for us, either, just what we had decided for that particular Monday. 

Sex is better overall for me...I understand more and I last longer. The refractory period is quite a bit longer than it was when I was seventeen...but at the same time, I've learned to take my time and please my partner, and the majority of the time a second round is overkill. (And leaves us both sore!) 
























 I like my oldman danglies, and I ain't givin' 'em up for nobody! Now git offa my lawn!

 Just for the funny. Adventuresome and with a significant portion of my "sexytime" bucketlist crossed off...lol.  




 I am finally recognized as the authority on all things sexual and get to introduce various and frequent virginal young women to the joys of all the sexytime things.

I've had this fantasy for a long time, and revisit it often.

 









 Making a joke, but honestly, (manager here) we get that shit for free from AMEX and VISA/MC...approach a manager about buying one...we like the random tip every now and again too, you know. I would totally sell you one. Hell, if you were nice to me I'd probably give it to you. 




 Hungry? Go out to eat...and....you know....*wink 














 Not every day during Hellweek, but often enough. We both believe that just because the roller coaster shut down, you don't close the amusement park. 




 This is a hard thing to learn if it doesn't come naturally. I'm lucky enough to just sort of "get it"...but I've worked with people before that didn't have natural timing.

The answer is planning and practice. Plan your meals (or work from recipes) and timeline your meal. You need x amount of time for rice to cook, x amount of time to prep meat, x amount of time to bake bread, etc. Plan backwards from mealtime. Meal is at x o'clock, then rice has to be started at x-20 minutes. Cook time + prep time on your entree is 60 minutes, then start the prep at x-60 minutes. Put it on paper, and stick to it.

Then practice practice practice. I still have an occasion or two where I mess up the timing, but I have enough practice time in the kitchen that I can adapt. 




 Hard to say without actually being in the kitchen, or at least with more info. If the chicken was put in late, and not time abused at that point, then microing could bring everything into safe temp and kill any baddies floating about. But as someone mentioned above, if microorganisms are sufficiently present, cooking off an killing them solves only part of the problem, and could create more of one. The microorganisms leave behind toxins that are not temperature sensitive. 




 Interesting fact about pork and trichinosis...the reason most people still think pork has to be nearly incinerated to be considered safe. Trich (a parasitic worm larvae) was rampant in the marketplace well into the 70's. Food scientists investigating Trich discovered that it's lifecycle needed a pig to consume feces (or offal) from pigs infected already. Slop feeding of hogs was immediately outlawed for market hogs, and by the late 80's, Trich was almost completly removed from the marketplace. Newest update from USDOH/USDA have temps as low as 140f for cuts, and 135f for roasts. I personally enjoy thick center cut chops at a nice medium rare. Delicious! 




 I didn't want to get into anatoxins and food intoxification! I thought we'd keep it simple. I wonder with the resurgence of the crockpot's popularity if maybe we'd all be served well by paying a little closer attention to the safety of the food we're serving. 




 Someone else mentioned the sliding scale. It's a little different when sous-vide and hydroemersion cooking. Used as a point of reference, and even at long time, low temp cooks, the four hour benchmark applies and OP's chicken should have appeared cooked. 




 Lol. Yep. Consider this, how many times have you had a little "24 hour bug"? The squirts and a bit of a tummy ache? That was food poisoning at low levels, more than likely. Being young and assumedly healthy, your body and your friends can take it. That same dish that might make you just a little sick, or not effect you at all could cause serious problems for an elderly person or someone with a weakened immune system. 




 Absolutely correct. Assuming no time or temp abuse happened beforehand. Within reasonable consideration you can "cook out" any mistakes. Even at low temp cooks though poultry would fully cook and appear white throughout (excluding any other ingredients that could color ingredients). 




 Couple of things about the four-hour benchmark. First, it's cumulative. Any time that chicken spends in the danger zone has to be considered part of that four hour window. If you leave your chicken on the counter to thaw for an hour, you would want it to hit a safe serving temp of 165f within THREE hours...if you start considering prep time, cook time, thaw time, you can see that working with poultry, especially chicken is serious business. As for once a dish is done, most crocks have a low temp or holding temp. That will usually keep it at or near a hot enough temp to be safe for as long as the crock is holding it hot. Personally I wouldn't let my crockdish set out for longer than about an hour to cool, and I consider that as part of my four hour window. 




 Slightly safer. With chicken, you can't be too safe. Other meats are safer. It's safe to assume that any market chicken is already contaminated with some level of Salmonella.

Food, to be considered potentially hazardous has to have certain characteristics. FATTOM. Food for the microorganism, a friendly acidity level, time to pass, within the temperature danger zone, oxygen (for most microorganisms, there are some anerobic dangers, like botulism) and moisture. Marinating with a vinegary marinade can change the acidity levels, but again with chicken, probably not enough to get me to try chicken that was served medium rare or spent six hours in the danger zone. 




 Sure. Crash course food safety here.

Some foods are potentially hazardous. Meaning that given the right conditions could harbor microorganisms that they could get you very sick. 

One of the right conditions is temperature. It is safe to store food below 41 degrees f or over 140 degrees f. These temperatures inhibit the growth of potentially hazardous microorganisms.

Within that temperature range (41 to 140 degrees f) exists the optimum temperatures that encourage microorganism growth.

The other thing that food needs to encourage microorganism growth is time. The general rule is that if food spends a total four hours within the temperature danger zone, then that food is no longer safe for human consumption, and should not be eaten.

So, in the slow cooking example here, if the chicken had not reached 165 degrees f (the minimum internal temperature for chicken to be considered "done") within the 8 hour cooktime, then there was a very likely chance that the entire dish spent four hours or more within that temperature danger zone, (assuming room temperature ingredients, chilled chicken, etc) meaning that all the right conditions for microorganism growth existed.

Saying all that, there is wiggle room, and this is the most basic explanation of some advanced food safety considerations. Read up on minimum internal temperatures, time and temperature food abuse, and the temperature danger zone to learn more. 




 Temp it! If the chicken is around 165 f or so, you have cooked chicken. 

My concern here is that if you have pink chicken after 8 hours of cooking, you might not have hit the "165 f in four hours" benchmark, which could mean that your meal could be potentially hazardous. Proceed with caution. 




 It's a short one, but it's my current favorite: 

"I read once that the ancient Egyptians had fifty words for sand 

  the Eskimos had a hundred words for snow. 

I wish I had a thousand words for love, but all that comes to mind is the way you move against me while you sleep 

  there are no words for that. ~Brian Andreas

So brief, but so packed with feeling. I can hear how much he loves this woman in this short passage. Being in several relationships where I loved a woman fiercely, I get this reference...it's not easy to explain why you love someone, but "the way you move against me while you sleep" is as good as any, and that feeling, were it taken away, would leave a gaping hole behind. It just seems that Andreas was aware enough to recognize that one moment as an example of what that kind of love is, and put words to it. 




 I sorta wrestled with it for a minute, but really it's just one of those things. I don't know the difference, and it was just "normal" at that time for an American white male born in the 70's.

Our family is a fan of logic and science and reason, and thinking about things. Doing just a small amount of research showed us that there was little necessity for circumcision. That was really all it took for us. 




 I'm cut, my son isn't. Our issue was simple...we saw no evidence of medical need for circumcision, and found quite a bit of evidence supporting a "whole-man" stance.

There have been some studies that showed a decrease in some STIs,  including HIV, transmission in cut v uncut, but it was a small difference, and I equated it to cutting of your nose so you don't get the sniffles.

A friend of ours, a nurse, tried very hard to convince us otherwise for cleanliness issues. I asked her how often she cleaned her ears, and if she ever thought of removing them from her head so that she wouldn't have to be troubled by that anymore.

In short, we felt that it was archaic, and barbaric, and unnecessary, and the boy not looking like me thing hasn't really ever come up. I've done the research, I know what he needs to know about hygiene, and any possible issues that may pop up, and we've talked about them. I don't think he knows that I am cut, and at this point (he's ten) I don't see a need for him to know. I would tell him the truth if he asked, of course. 









 Good to know, thanks for the answer. 




 Great idea. I may know a couple of folks, I'm sending it on. Could something like this exist for convicted felons? 




 Huge King fan here. I see what you mean about It. I love the story, think it's great, but the dialogue was ... off. Hard to write ten year olds doing really adult stuff, and try to capture the adults responding to the stresses of the kids they were. 

Saying that, I think It stands out in that failing, along with The Talisman (another great book, but the main character is young). His early writings lack the depth of his later work, but are worth the read for the rawness of them. 

Recommendations? Try some of the short story collections. They're quicker, less depth and character development, and equally good. If you like those, expand! There's so much to like. And, because I almost have to, try the Gunslinger. Unlike his other work, but tied to almost everything that he's done before.

Personal favs: Tommyknockers - An unexpected find in the woods leads to unexpected results. A little more grown up of a story. Needful Things - A new shop opens up in a small town, and sells exactly what you want, but can you afford it? Misery - A big time writer meets small town crazy. Insomnia - An old man can't sleep, and starts seeing things that may or may not be real. The Stand - An epidemic leads to a spiritual good v evil finale. (Bit cheesy at the end, but the journey is worth it.) 




 Just recently watched "All is Lost" with Robert Redford. Kinda of an artfilm, no dialogue, just a story of a man and his boat. Worth the watch. 














 Plenty of folks already here saying encopresis, which my ten yo is dealing with. What no one is saying is that [r/encopresis](http://www.reddit.com/r/encopresis) exists. New sub for parents dealing with this issue. 














 Umm....don't want to be that guy, but... *Niggerback?* 




 The only real cure is prevention. Drink water. Get drunk, maintain drunk by alternating alcohol then water. Now that you're fucked, the only thing to do is eat something that will soak up any leftover alcohol, something heavy to give a sense of fullness, and start pounding water. Take something for  your head, but not aspirin...that can hurt your liver, and it's already on the ropes. Think when you drink, friend. Next time. 




 We made a simple mistake. My son has my name, and my daughter has my wife's name. Not Jr, just first names. It has caused problems whenever dealing with forms and such. I don't know if I regret it enough to rethink it...I'm happy with their names, but it wasn't something that we thought of ahead of time. (We all have different nicknames at home) 




 Probably not what you're looking for here, but today is my Dad's birthday, and he's been on my mind a bit today.

My dad worked hard to support our family, and I appreciate that.

But when you ask what I would thank him for, the things that come to mind are the negative stereotypes that he evinced. 

I never wanted to be a father. My dad didn't seem to want a family. It was something that he felt he had to do, and it showed. He was distant, and often angry (more on that later) and sometimes abusive, to me, my younger sister and my mom. Later in life when I became a father, the things that I always hoped my father would be guided me through the difficult transition into fatherhood. I knew that I wanted to be present, and involved, and positive, and not ham-fisted and judgemental. I've got pops to thank for that.

Pops was a Vietnam vet with a serious anger problem. Most of my memories of him are him being angry. Often for things and reasons that I didn't understand. While his experiences in Vietnam were a big reason for that unresolved anger, I learned later in life that it was something that sort of ran in my family. I experienced it firsthand as a teen and later as a twentysomething that was constantly angry. At myself, at the world, at girlfriends, at everything. There was a moment where I realized that I was becoming the things that I disliked in my father, and that was all I needed to realize I didn't want to go through life that way. After a few years of therapy and some very understanding friends, I developed some tools that have helped me deal with that fuming red dragon, and it has been a long time since I blew up at something stupid. I still get angry, I just now know how to deal with it when it happens. So, thanks Dad, for that too. 

My dad, like I said above, felt like family was an obligation. He put aside everything that he wanted in his life, because he felt he had to. As soon as my sister and I left home, he started to persue the things in life he wanted. (i.e. music performance, stage, small screen, re-enactments, that sort of thing.) He eventually spent so much time away from home and mom, that they divorced after 27 years of marriage. I learned that I should never forget to chase my dreams, and make them part of my family, less I become something that I am not. Thanks, Dad, for that too.

I recently started talking to Pops again. Small conversations, usually on Facebook. He apologized and recognized that he was a broken father, and I did my best to forgive him, and thinking about it now....maybe I've got to thank him for that too. It's never too late to try and apologize. (I don't know if it will help our relationship at all, but it was nice to hear.)

Thank your Dad for being there. For being strong. For raising you right. It's clear that you want to thank your dad for what he did; that means he did a good job, and hearing that from someone whom he loves is going to mean the world and more to him. I don't think it will matter how many words it takes to tell him that. :)

 I have a daughter. She is the most beautiful thing that I get to see everyday. I tell her everyday that she is beautiful, but I do go out of my way to reward her for being smart and kind and thoughtful and for following rules and helping her brother and a million other things. She can know she's beautiful, I don't think that's a problem, and I don't think that it will become a problem, because even though I tell her often that she is beautiful, she gets rewarded for doing things, not just for being things. But that's just like, my opinion, man. 




 Possibly. I don't know of any interview where he mentions when he is a fan, but as many know, he is a member of the [Rock Bottom Remainders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Bottom_Remainders), a band made up of mostly published authors. They played together from around 92 to 2012 or so, including a show at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Their set included a cover of Rockaway Beach by the Ramones. He has said in interviews about the band that they only play music that they like, and that is easy to play; the Ramones would easily fit the bill there. 




 I don't know about these individuals, but I'm going with the Tampon Bay Pluganeers....just like a tampon, they only have one string and are only good for one period. 



















 "We can't stop spying on our citizens...because ISIS"? Really? That's the best they could do? Who voted these fucks back in office?  




 I completely agree with this author. He makes an excellent point by being stupid. These facts are bad, and the author should feel bad. 














 My grandmother was a very special woman in my life. We did not get a chance to say a proper goodbye even though her death was expected. (Expected far earlier than it happened; she lived with intestinal cancer for the last ten years of her life.) I would absolutely trade a year of my life for an hour long conversation with her. A chance for her to see the man I grew to be, to meet my children and my wife. Easy choice.  




 Read the book, for sure. Then watch the most recent movie. The film does a good job dealing with....uh...some sensitive subject matter, but it can't capture the overall feel of the novel, for obvious reasons. The film lacks depth without reading the book first, but that's like just my opinion, man. 




 Thanks for this. Could use a support community. 





























 The twelve string guitar is played the same as a six string. There are six sets of two strings. The bass EADG are an octave apart; the standard string and one octave higher, the B and e are sets of the same string. Simple enough. Fun to play, big full sound. 









 Sexto in english means "sixth". 

Also, penalizar means "to penalize"...kinda sounds like penal lizard or penile lizard. I'm reaching here, I know.

Pianista...a pianist. 




 You feel like you accomplished something when you get out. Of the blonde. 




 The scientific view on aliens and gods are very different. 

We have discovered life already; here on Earth. However, we have not discovered any gods.

We have discovered that most stars have planets, and that some of those planets exist in a habitable zone around their respective stars, providing a possible place for life to exist. However, we have not discovered any proof of where gods or afterlives or punishment schemes may take place. 

We have discovered that here on our planet, life exists in almost every niche imaginable. From our upper atmosphere, to the deepest parts of the ocean, from high temps to low temps, from high o2 to low o2, etc. However, we have not found any proof that gods occupy any space other than the collective imagination of their creators. 

Personally, I don't identify as an atheist, I identify as someone who requires some proof before I believe in outlandish claims. I do not believe in any gods because there is no proof of them ever existing. I do however, believe in the **possibility** of extraterrestrial life (not "aliens" so much, but microorganisms, possibly more advanced simple life) because the exosciences continue to show that life finds a way here on earth, no matter how extreme the circumstances, that other stars have planets, and that some of those planets exist in habitable zones, that water is plentiful in the universe, and that only considers our closed minded assumption that any life we find will be carbon based and water needy.

I think, much like the explosion of discovery with exoplanets in the last decade or so, life will be found singly somewhere, probably in the fairly new future. That discovery will help us understand how and where to look for life, and we will find that while life itself may not be abundant in the universe, the possibility of life is. 




 Doesn't change your argument, but the Florida State College, before the reorganization of the Florida Education system which turned FSC into the Florida Women's College, (which later became FSU) fielded a football team from 1902 until 1905...said team was sent to Gainesville under the reorganization efforts of the Florida Dept of Ed. Yes, the Gators were born in Tallahassee. Sort of.

edit: clarification 




 Couldn't tell you the last time I bought a CD from a online retailer or in person....probably more than 10 years ago. Last CD I bought was at a show, semi-underground guy named Zach Deputy, probably about three years ago. 




 My current wife was sort of a hook up our first time. The first couple times were fun, fun enough that I came back for more. We became compatible very quickly. We dated for ten years, got married five years ago. Two kids together, still finding new ways to experiment and have fun. So, I guess the first time it didn't matter, but the sexual compatibility we discovered led to our dating, which led to our romantic relationship, which led to kids and marriage, so maybe it mattered.  














 I show up to work at about 8am. Start with coffee. If I'm lucky, somebody will bring donuts or something I can stuff in my face while I'm working in the kitchen. Around 9am I have to have honey glazed carrots roasting, and bacon cooked off for the turkey gravy and the green beans. I already roasted the turkey the night before, so I don't have to worry about that too much, but I do have to worry about making mashed potatoes and the gravy and the green beans and the stuffing, and making sure that the desserts are getting handled (this year probably 12-14 apple pies, and 10 or so pecan pies), and setting up for service, all by 11:30 or so. I'll spend lunch and dinner on the line, usually plating about 130 covers or so for the day (that's in addition to regular menu service, about another 80-100 covers), sneaking in a snack here in there...usually while checking the scores to the football games. Around 9pm, I'll start to relax...we'll feed the staff leftovers, and break out the wine (if it was a good shift). By 10, I'll be at the bar, drinking whiskey and bitching about having to work another Thanksgiving. 









 Literally just watched it traverse about two hours ago (7:37pm EST). The text alerts and the app help a bunch. Having a little knowledge about where and when to look to the sky makes it super easy. (When I first got the alerts, and saw my first (confirmed) ISS sighting, I realized I had seen it a couple of times before, and not known what it was.) 














 Had one of my servers come back and ask about a medium plus...then she asked what that meant. The whole kitchen, damn near in unison, replied "MEDIUM WELL!" 




 What the hell is this? Why on earth would a link from Huzlers.com end up in r/science. Calm down folks, don't load up the shotguns and buy the booze yet, Earth will continue to experience its normal amount of sunlight over the foreseeable future. Thanks for calling. 









 Wouldn't that be great? But unfortunately, whenever a vacuum is created, something else is created to fill that void. (Second law of Inverse Televisionics) What ever is created to fill a recently created vacuum is also usually worse than that which was originally vacated, so the question becomes....what could possibly be worse than this? And, how many people will watch it? 
 


































 Yes. Absolutely yes. Baby powder is either talc or cornstarch. Talc gets broken down by sweat. Cornstarch babypowder is superfine, and gets everywhere, but it works better than talc baby powder.

I like to use the Vigo kitchen use cornstarch. It's not so superfine, not so messy, stays on, keeps drying all day. Just make sure to be dry before applying.

I've been using cornstarch for about six  years now. I work in an extremely hot and fast paced kitchen where I sweat and move around a lot. It's the very odd day that I have any rash or jungle rot going on anymore. 




 Shower often. 

Dry well after shower.

Apply cornstarch.
 









 Most of Hughes work fills out my top # list, certainly in comedies. Great film.

 Yep. She certainly did.
 









 The-Destroyer.
 




 I completely agree with Dean Vernon. He's a must-add. 














 No....not that one. I have told people to eat a bag of them, though.
 




 I use a fair amount of these. This article is specifically about "diner" lingo...think old fashioned steel bullet trailers, a waitress named Flo, a guy in the open kitchen with a grease-stained apron....a lot of this has carried over. 







































 Daytona Beach, FL and surrounding area! Blue hairs and Canadians!  







































 Django Reinhardt in Paris. 1933. Le quintette du Hot Club de France. Fuck yeah, the birth of gypsy jazz guitar. That or when Dylan got booed at the Newport Folkfest in '65 for going electric.
