 Thanks - [I finally got a chance to briefly take a look](http://library.islamweb.net/hadith/asaneed.php?bk_no=664 cid=4564 sid=720) (didn't check that the other wordings are identical) - but I may have had bad information here since some of these are at least purportedly hasan. I was taught that cannibalism was haram by ijma and not by an actual textual proof so I must've misunderstood that at some point to have meant there was no textual proof while there seems to be. 














 A recent fatwa has been placed against calling them apostates

**{citation needed}**

i have heard of bad things they have done but I haven't heard of takfir... I know for a fact some shias do takfir but it is not representative of us, same way daesh is not representing sunnis. 

Look - I'm sure you don't believe this garbage, the idea that the Prophet of The All-Knowing God handpicked a bunch of his closest companions who would turn around and betray him and leave the religion...I'm just pointing out that it's absolutely intellectually dishonest for you to pass that off as a general/pervasive opinion among Shi'ites, or what the religious texts support.

This is not like the issue of Daesh not representing Sunnis. Daesh are literally only a handful of Sunnis. Out of over a billion people, Daesh are a couple thousand. That's nothing.

The takfir on the Sahaba in general *"illa thalatha"* (or some other number) in the Twelver religious texts (**literally chapters are titled by this issue**), and by the founders of the religion (the early scholars) is insanely extensive...This doesn't come from the lecture of some po-dunk Molvi in Pakistan during an Ashura sermon...I'd be happy to link you to examples if you're legitimately unfamiliar with this - do you understand Arabic? 




 The notion "your madhab", "your sect", "your ideology" and various other alternatives were valid, but your religion indicates Shi'as are of a separate religion, like Christians, or Jews.

It indicates that your religion is not Islam, and that your religion does not constitute a legitimate Islamic sect (like Sunnis, Ibadis, Zaydis, Mutazillis, etc.). It doesn't mean you're not Muslim, and the distinction is made by innumerable ulema. I'm not misapplying grammar, and I'm not doing takfir - you're just jumping to conclusions.

Nation of Islam, the Druze Religion, Alawi Shi'ism, Qadiyanism, etc. are not Islam. Tenets of each of these religions, if believed, would in theory put you outside of Islam. But by the benefit of the doubt, and the sahahada, the assumption is that the lay-person of these religions is technically Muslim. The "religions" themselves are outside of Islam. The ruling on the religion doesn't extend to the people who ascribe to these groups unless they adhere specially to those things that constitute shirk.

No backtracking here or lying (I'm not a Twelver like you brother)... 

Therefore point still stands

Your point boils down to the fact that some Imam who ran a seminary did something stupid. That Imam has nothing to do with *me*, or with Ahlus Sunnah as a generality. My criticism is about *your religion* itself and the fundamental premise on which your religion, and every book of Twelver ahadith is built (lying). It's rather sad that when confronted with the absurd nature of *your religion*, the best you can do is attack some *personalities* that ascribe to another religion. I hope you can notice the distinction.

I didn't say you were wrong - the man seems to do what you're claiming he did - saved his life by walking out in a burqa - it's just irrelevant to the Sunni Islam... And as embarrassing as that is, I'd rather be caught in a burqa than ascribe to a set of beliefs that makes 'Ali (ra) look like a pathetic wimp and suggest the Imams (ra) were a bunch of liars.

And easy out, I can feel your anger bursting out from comments, lol, chill out if you may :)

LOL. Wallahi I'm not angry, I'm just sorry for you. 




 A Mormon missionary very vocally made the claim that the Book of Mormon is an authentic book from Divine inspiration. I asked the Mormon why he believes in Joseph Smith and his book - what makes it authentic. He said to go read the Book of Mormon, with sincere intention, and the Holy Spirit would guide me to know its true. I asked him if he could give me even a small tid-bit, a teaser, to suggest that it was authentic and from God, and all I got was the same circular logic. I understand the guy blindly believed in that non-sense and had no credible reason for it, but you'd expect people to at least be a little honest with themselves.

I just asked for the name of a muhaqiq. Khayr inshaAllah, I'll look into it, best of luck. 




 I highlight "your religion" right up there, and that is still not enough for your to read and make stupid assumptions?

Yea, I said "your religion"...how is that takfir?...Qadiyani and Alawi religions etc. aren't Islam either...that doesn't mean me, or anybody else, does blanket takfir on every average Druze / Alawi...

As for your "Taqiyyah" comment, all I say is that our scholars don't go full lunatic and try to escape in women's clothing on broad daylight like Mullah Abdul Aziz here

Right...Because some random Imam at a Masjid from Pakistan attempting to save his life has just as much relevance to my *religion* as the fact that your *religion* is based on telling lies right down to your fundamental books of ahadith, to the extent that your major modern scholars [don't even cover it up anymore](http://arabic.al-khoei.org/falea.htm)...

But I suppose if laughing at some random Sunnis in embarrassing situations makes you feel better about the fairy tales you go to bed with at night, I guess that's something. 




 Also, do you count add a traveller if you're travelling for work? 

You'd be musafir (traveller) even if you were making safr for a haram reason. 

But I would *ask a sheikh* if you want a detailed response with ahadith - there's too many variables in your question for anybody to easily search up all the associated ahadith. Is this boat going to another destination, or are you on a navy sub / aircraft carrier that will just turn around after some time period? etc. etc. etc. 




 I don't understand what you mean by the forward...in the English translation? Can you TL;DR for me one piece of evidence or the name of the muhaqiq who did the authentication and I'll look it up?

Appreciate it! 




 generalization of all Shia begins, leading to you being called kafir. 

Ruling on the generality doesn't mean it applies in specificity.

I find that hard to believe

Why? 




  Shia believe, simply based on fact and evidence, that it is reliable, and would argue (many would say very effectively) that it is sahih.

In that case, if you dont mind, can you tell me which muhaqiq did the authentication? Of all the narrations? It seems like a real feat since the author doesn't provide sanad for anything, the muhaqiq would literally have to first find the asl for every tradition on his own as well... 




 Will there be any Muslims with you on the boat? There's no salat al-juma without a jama. Will the boat be in such a condition that you're musafir? There's no salat al-juma for the musafir.

You should ask a sheikh with your specific details. 




 Source for what? That you're musafir while on the boat? Or that there is no juma for the musafir? (the later is the jamhoor opinion so I'm sure you can google it). 




 Nonetheless, I am comfortable with acknowledging myself as a Shia and it makes me very sad when some people try to disregard us as Muslim completely, even if they do not know what we believe in personally. 

TBF - Very few people do takfir of the majority, or even of the average Twelver Shi'i. Criticizing the religion isn't the same as making takfir of you *personally* 




 Right...well obviously the Shia would not believe that. 

Why not? As a Sunni, if you brought meaningful evidence demonstrating the weakness of a hadith, I won't believe it anymore. As an example, there's a beautiful and extremely popular saying attributed to the Prophet to seek knowledge even if you have to go all the way to China. At some point, I learned this hadith was mawdu at worst and da'if or tenuously hasan li-ghayrihi at best.

If you have substantial and convincing evidence for something, it shouldn't matter how popular it is or what your sectarian affiliation is. 




 No offense but most books written purporting to be ex-Shias that became Sunni are usually hoaxes.

That's a pretty substantial claim. Do you have examples of these hoaxes and associated books? I know plenty of ex-Shias in person as well as a number of people well-known on places like ShiaChat over the last 10 years who left the Twelver religion so it would be rather strange for Sunnis to resort to such cheap/desperate tactics...when there's so many knowledgeable ex-Shi'is, scholars, people who drop out of hawza and hawza "graduates"...

If you have a recommendation of one that's written by the real deal I'd be open to it.

Sure - not in English though. Do you read any other language (Farsi, Urdu, Arabic?). 




 A recent fatwa has been placed against calling them apostates

{citation needed}

And if you're going to point to an aberrant opinion of one of the few reasonable twelver ulema like Fadlallah, it's still intellectually dishonest on your part to imply that Twelvers as a group don't do takfir of Sheikhan when Twelver scholars by jamhoor, historically and today, and hadith books prove the opposite... 




 I like nothing better than people showing their close mindedness and doing a mass takfir like this.

Where did I do mass takfir on any post...ever? I understand you need to build strawmen as you wanted to question the scholarship of Husayn Murad and got exposed on that front - but isn't that a bit much?

I suppose when lying is a fundamental part of your religion you just can't help yourself huh... 




 I have never heard of such so-called esteemed scholar...Another one of those mullahs on the petro-dollar honour roll

GreyMatter hasn't heard of him so he must be a nobody on the "petro-dollar honor roll" [**in Jordan**](http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/_).... Being on TV or embroiled in politics isn't the only way to be a major reputable scholar - as this guy was in Twelver scholarly circles before he left, more so than the clowns hyped up by apologists of your religion like al-Tijani as examples of people leaving Ahlus Sunnah... [You must suck at using Google btw...](http://www.al-shia.org/html/ara/books/lib-rejal/nafahat/234.htm) 




 He cited everything he said. A lot of shit went missing after Operation Iraqi Freedom... 




 What makes ISIS think they're more Islamic than the early caliphs? 

TBF, a lot of the times destroying some idols wasn't pragmatic. It wasn't a decision to preserve art/history (see Egypt under 'Umar). In other cases, the Muslims never reached some of those areas entirely during the early empires since the Muslims in al-sham and Iraq didn't really mingle with the non-Muslim communities that fell under their protection. Some empires/rulers were also more prone to iconoclastic tendencies than others (Ayyubids, Mahmad Ghaznavi, Aurangzeb, etc.).

That said, these aren't exactly idols. Nobody worships them and its a shame we've lost something that gives us a glimpse into the past. 




 You're arguing for the sake of arguing brother, and you were wrong on multiple occasions in this thread alone. Take a breather and reassess your intentions, your ego shouldn't be one of them. 




 Well a Muslim reddit user said it was not accurate, another said there are more accurate and more respected translations. 

It's not inaccurate - The criticism against it was that it was verbose, and because of how much Keller wrote in terms of notes, it's more of a commentary on the book vs a translation. Some people don't agree entirely with the commentary. The translation itself is as good as a translation will get. 




 Al-Tijani is a clown...

If he read's al-Tijani's books (rudood of which you can easily find in entire volumes in 'Arabic or even of several assertions on English sites or his humiliating representation on mustaqillah) - will you read a book by a Twelver leaving that religion and becoming Sunni? Are you fluent in any language besides English? 




 Shias have always debated, it has usually been others who silenced them.

Right...but even if there was some vast conspiracy to silence Shi'ite debaters instead of disproving them, I can understand why given that [lying to Sunnis as part of debates is allowed in this religion](http://arabic.al-khoei.org/falea.htm)...

:                       
:       . 
 




 they cannot be called apostaes

I don't understand how you're even able to *try* and spin this. There's entire chapters in the major Twelver hadith books on the fact that **ALL** of the Sahaba made irtidad except a couple...in contradiction to the dhahir meaning of several ayat...

It wouldn't take more than 20 minutes to find that same opinion uttered by the major scholars of the Twelver religion outside of primary sources either... 




 Zaydi Shi'ites believe it was unintentional. Their position is that the Prophet made no clear nass to appoint 'Ali - hence why Abu Bakr, Umar and the Sahaba in general aren't hated.

Twelver Shi'ism suggests the opposite (Majlissi - one of the major mashaykh of what I assume is your religion):

                                   ( )                        

The traditions in Twelver Shi'ite books about the appointment of 'Ali are extensive, as you must already be aware. Which means the only way Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman could've become Khulafa is by *intentionally* forgoing the command of the Prophet / not believing in it. Hence the conclusion above (on the kufr of Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and the Sahaba). 




 Sunni and Shia schools of thought have different principles of jurisprudance...

And completely different religious traditions (ahadith and athar). 




 Search up 1991 iraqi failed revolution and iran iraq war, they killed close to 700,000 of us, and that's the low estimate , the high estimate is about 2 million

Stop playing the sectarian victim bullshit. The 91 rebellion was started by ex-Ba'athis, Saddam didn't single out Shi'ites in exclusion to Sunnis for his reprisals - and to his death even when he became more religious, he didn't care or know anything meaningful about the differences Twelver Shi'ism introduced. Drawing Sectarian lines of targeting is the forte of your compatriots, and the modern organizations that grew to power as the only defense of Sunnis against your compatriots. 




 I don't think that passage exists in what we have of the Gospel of the Nazarenes, any of the other Jewish Gospels or proto-Matthew reconstructions. Which is what conartist probably meant by real Christians (Nazarenes, Ebionites, and early non-prosletyzing "Jewish" / non-Pauline Christians). You can also see some of other MSS (Shem Tov as an example) lacking even the "all the nations" clause - and explicitly contradicting the idea of Christ being sent to non-Jews.

And at best we know that even the traditional Matthew manuscripts were substantially modified in this verse. See "in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit" as the well-known interpolation. So IMO it would be a bit problematic to rely on this statement attributed to Christ exclusively as evidence of his goal being to spread his message to gentiles. 




 Hey, dude, they didn't kill him, he is in custody and they don't plan to torture or kill him.

I didn't say they killed the kid who was referenced by OP. I said that you can't treat a witness as reliable when he's being held captive, especially by organizations known to use torture. The video I posted is of a kid who they *did* kill. He's tied up, being slapped around and ultimately shot in the head.

You just gave a random video and said this is what shia iraqi army does to sunni kids without context.

Do you want videos of Iraqi army soldiers in Iraqi army fatigues doing the same thing? I've posted several videos like that to /r/iraq and /r/syriancivilwar...before the US came in and helped the Iraqi army clean up their PR, the Golden Brigades Facebook page was proudly posting videos of the same sort of stuff (torture, putting corpses and driving them around on vehicles, executions of tied up Sunnis, executions/burnings of Sarkhi's Shi'ites, etc.). My videos are direct from the army page...you can look through my old submissions...

I could give countless examples of sunnis doing all sorts of horrible things to shias

You mean the mass executions? I don't see how that's hardly comparable to torture videos and executions of kids who don't look like they've even hit puberty...

sunnis are not a largely persecuted,genocided and victimized group

Right...Baghdad went from a Sunni majority to a Shi'ite majority through peaceful means... 




 The images are pictures of people in Bashar's prisons. You can see signs of torture and starvation. The pictures are a small subset of what's going to be coming out soon (you can check the NY Times or many other established networks about the pictures to be released). It's irrelevent if they're fighters or not, there's Islamic ways - fuck that - human ways to treat captives.

**The video is of a kid, tied up, being slapped around by Shi'ite soldiers. He's then shot in the head**. A gun is a gun - sure... When you're a POW, you don't have a gun anymore... 




 It makes sense though. He's looking to consolidate his power with minimal use of force so he'll want Imams on payroll for the future of "Islam" in Egypt. What is difficult to implement over thousands of tiny mosques becomes much more solvable when implemented against fewer mosques that just have larger congregations. 




 Sounds peachy - but having your life expectancy halved just to get laid seems a bit much lol... 




 It is evil without a God because the person who is raped did not consent.

The animals we kill and eat don't consent either. The junkie you do an intervention on didn't consent either. The suicidal bridge jumper you pull down didn't consent either. A sado-masochist can consent to real physical harm. An incestuously minded couple can consent to an incestuous relationship.

I don't see how consent being the basis for defining "evil" or morals is at all reasonable. 




 Go to your local mosque. The literal meaning of "Qur'an" is recitation - it wasn't something people simply read in their homes, it requires interactive dialogue. When Islam spread originally, it wasn't through people handing out copies of Qur'an translations but acting as actual delegates who would explain Qur'an/Islam to different cities/communities/kings. Ask if they have a Qur'an class at your local mosque or an Islam 101 sorta thing. Don't be scared - these guys are generally friendly

IMO the best place to learn, whether you're a beginner or somebody who's on his way to being the mujadid of this century as with other people who (presently) know more than you do. 









 Dead - the Arabic English the end....damnnnn 




 If you keep this flair for over a week - you may have bigger things to worry about than this sub 




 If this report is accurate

It's not. He's a Sunni boy, who used to be in Daesh currently in the custody of the mostly Shi'ite Iraq army. You can imagine what they did to him...

Hell, you don't even need to imagine. NSFW [Here's what they do - as of yesterday](https://vid.me/e/IRqX?card=1) to Sunni children that they capture from Daesh. This story has no credibility unless that kid is in a safe place - no testimony of an obvious Iraqi prisoner is real testimony. Same goes for the testimony of NSFW [captives of SAA/Hezbollah.](https://www.facebook.com/StandwithCaesar/photos_stream) 




 [Fake story](http://imgur.com/VxoxFNP)

The image originally came from Quds-news. There's a Jan 15 timestamp, so this kid was injured before that pilot execution video was even released! An Arabic news agency then fabricated this story mid-February after which it was picked up by a bunch of online news sites. And now it's beginning to get spread to English "news" like this website. The entire story, as well as the lousy explanation of how this remote village saw the graphic video is fiction.

No doubt it's tragic that this kid was hurt - regardless of the circumstances. But I find it sicker that people are using the legitimate suffering of others and reinventing propaganda around it. 




 This news story is likely false. I remember seeing this picture a long time back.

 There's different opinions on drawing pictures, but robots are a totally separate category. 




 It makes as much of a statement about a group as the people they kill, if we're going to use that to understand them. Everybody operates with some sort of morals. Neither ISIS, nor the Iraqi army, or the myriad of other organizations go in thinking "heh, we're the villains". 




 Yep. 




 You'd be surprised. Al-Muhajiroon, Sh. Abu Hamza al Misri, Anjem Chowdry, etc. all used to say stuff like this with impunity. The government, in theory, cares more if you actually plan to do something like that (versus liking that it happened). 




  Very very contentious topic and a lot of misinformation due to the emotions relating to it.

She didn't lead a revolt per say. She moved on Basrah before 'Ali had widely been given the bayah. 'Ali actually then moved his army towards Basrah. In any case, here's some in-depth talks based on Muslim historical chronicles:

[Lecture on the topic by Sh. Adnan Abdul Qadir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9ciR5Vwa1k)

[Detailed part of a lecture series by Mufti Abdur Rahman b Yusuf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH5sdjJ6U5I)

Conflicting views come from the fact that the people to whom this is an important issue (Shi'ites) have their own religious texts produced later on (see al Kafi al Kulayni, Bihar al Anwar by al Majlissi). They record many of the same narrations as all the rest of the sects, but their narrative will focus on attacking Ayesha. The narrations there will pose Ayesha in the most vehemently negative light. They also come from the fact that Sunni historians (like at-Tabari) used to record narrations from all people, including different sects, reliable people and unreliable people, descendents of people who fought in the war, etc.

It boils down to simply, 'Ali was given bayah but people were unhappy that the culprits weren't caught. Talha and Zubair, who originally gave their oath of allegiance to 'Ali, were unhappy with his reluctance to immediately pursue/turn-over/punish the alleged killers of Uthman so they went to one of the highest authorities among Muslims, Ayesha, a Mother of the Believers as she was known. She, based on their narratives, was encouraged to march and convince 'Ali to deal with the issue. She went with a large group of men and this resulted in a short battle. After 'Ali won, he made sure she was safely able to return home. It was a political dispute where 'Ali was in a pickle, for political reasons, he couldn't easily handle the situation promptly, but people wanted blood (their former caliph had just been killed). The majority of scholars held that she was incorrect in her ijtihad, and he was correct, afaik. 




  This was in direct defiance of the quranic verse telling the wives to remain inside their homes after the death of the Prophet.

There are exceptions to that rule ya himar...they aren't under house arrest once the Prophet dies... 




 Khawarij is plural btw...

The kid looks 13-14 at most, they slap him around before shooting him in the head - it's very hard to watch. 




 He condemned violence against mass civilian targets, not necessarily what he was doing. That said, it's possible his life circumstances made him change his mind? Or he believed the people he was executing were legitimate targets for some reason or another? Who knows - there's more to it. 




 They don't generally kill kids. You may remember the several kidnapped Kurdish boys in Syria. They were allowed to speak with their families on the phone and were just given an alternative education. A current example would be the fact that ISIS freed the elderly Assyrian hostages they were holding (they still have around 200 hostages remaining). That's the most notorious group in the region, you can extrapolate that most of these extremists avoid killing certain classes of people. 




 If you condemn Shi'ite atrocities, you must be an ISIS fanboy. /s 




 Before ISIS declared a caliphate and was moving on Baghdad, prisons were full of former fighters against the Iraq government / Coalition forces. After the big move, the prisons were basically empty. 




 Second one was condemned by everyone, so it was probably ISIS(dont lump them with the rebels) 

Nope - I remember that one. That one was FSA or some other group - it was from over a year ago. 




 None. ISIS just has better production value and is more honest about it. 




 They used to post stuff like this - and worse, regularly on the Golden Brigades division facebook page (Iraqi army) - including videos of torture. Not just of Sunnis - they took a video after burning alive a Sarkhist Shi'ite (during their short lived rebellion) and drug the corpse around the street chained to a motorcycle.

There are *tons* of videos like this, they don't have the same production value as ISIS videos and don't get mass media attention like ISIS. Something seemingly hard to comprehend for a lot of people is that almost every major group plays dirty. 




 Shi'ite militias / Iraqi army are generally good about not filming (before the ISIS quagmire, the proof was usually corpses with signs of torture like drill marks). But not always. 




 If somebody gave me money to remove a thread, I'd remove it.
If a 7 or above wanted to suck me off to remove a thread, I'd remove it.
If I got a cease and desist or official request for takedown with lawery jargon on it - I'd probably remove it.

They said they removed it as it was 'misleading' (in this particular case - that might even be an accurate assessment). You can decide for yourself if it was accurate or misleading. But as to why they removed it - nobody here *actually* knows so you're asking the wrong group of people... 




 Yep - you have to do a search for the ones with the "misleading" tag that got removed by mods to find ones that are actually accurate. 




 It's definitely not an issue that can be resolved easily by just replacing corrupt mods. The people who seek power are never the ones who deserve it most.

 No Information = No Limit 




 The current trend in India is Fascist. Modi, of the BJP, who presided over the Gujrat Riots/Massacre of Muslims, was popularly elected. He's what you'd call a strong-man leader. Mein Kampf is a pretty popular read because people are impressed by Hitler, in spite of his ultimate failure, in his ability to drive his nation out of a slump and make it power-house at that time. There's also the fact that people in India recognize the role played by Adolf indirectly in India gaining her independence. You can say that all of this leads to an affinity with the man which in turn leads to denying the things he did which they don't necessarily agree with. You can compare it to the nearly instantaneous response of "Pallywood" conspiracy theories by many people any time Israel commits something egregious. It's effectively the same mind-state, affinity causes you to hype myths and minimize flaws. 




 There was a rally planned in opposition to Putin. The expected turnout was very low. Nemtsov, an opposition politician leading a very unpopular political party was effectively rotting away in obscurity to most Russians while Putin has the highest approval ratings of his dictatorial career. Nemtsov, the basically irrelevant politician, suggested in an interview that he might be assassinated. Nemtsov ended up being shot in the back of the head. The assumption was made by some people that Putin was responsible for offing this man. In turn, a small rally turned into something comparatively huge (50,000 people - or 0.4% of Moscow's population).

 Yeah, that hasn't happened ever. Usually international pressure results in more extreme punishments. I wouldn't be suprised if that's what's happening here.

Which makes complete sense - do you really want to set precedent in any country, as a leader, that will undermine the rule of law? Police forces to ever actually give hostage takers what they want. Many countries refuse to negotiate with those dubbed terrorists or hostage taking criminals, etc. for the same issue of precedent and what it encourages long-term. 




 My gut reaction is that the Saudis have figured out that for the next ten years and every time he is flogged, the story is going to be in the foreign media and will embarrass the kingdom. The would rather kill Raif now, take the bad press over it and let everybody forget about it in 6 months or so. I'm not an expert, but that's how this reads to me. 

That would be exceptional politics on their part. But I doubt it's the case. If he gets a death sentence, he will most probably be convicted without Saudi royalty whispering in the ears of the judge. You have to remember that the judiciary is composed of religious scholars, who by nature tend to be more zealous and less corrupt. The judiciary system in Saudi Arabia is pretty separate from the royalty (at least as far as this case his gotten).

The new king could *technically* let this guy off the hook in an appeal that travels up the chain to him, but he realistically can't do that. It would send the wrong message locally: If you're convicted for something that isn't a crime in the West, appeal to Western media to influence the judiciary. Attempting outside influence on the judiciary is actually a crime in its own right.

And all of that assumes this isn't just Badawi's wife and legal team trying to stir up a story in order to keep him on our radar.

 Does 4:140 forbid Muslims to talk with non-Muslims if the non-Muslims ridicule Islam?

It's a prohibition of sitting with anyone, even someone who is technically a Muslim, if they're mocking religion (until they stop). Islam distinguishes between dialogue and mockery and there's a rich tradition of Muslim apologetics without ad hominems from either party. Similar verses suggest to give them reminders about what they're doing wrong and about taking existence in jest.

Do 5:57   6:70 forbid Muslims from being friends with non-Muslims?

No, that's a war verse - you'll understand the context better if you read it with tafsir. If we read it out of context, then by that rationale, a person would have to distance himself from his non-Muslim relatives after conversion. Islam explicitly promotes the opposite. 




 Hah I wish - this was before YouTube and WorldStar 




 Debatable. Would I rather the Mona Lisa be in some private rich dude's mansion and nobody besides a privileged few would ever be able to see it or would I rather it be destroyed straight up?

 Can confirm, tried to take on 2 dudes boozed out their minds years ago (self defense). Had a golf club - tons of connections right to their heads. They seemed impervious to pain and just kept on rolling with it. Then I lost the golf club...I wasn't impervious to the pain.

 Most organizations do that so its not exactly odd.

Generally speaking, when ISIS and other criminal groups the world over (Africa, Asia, anywhere) get a hold of these goods, they remove the old emblems and put on their own and redistribute the aid in the impoverished areas (non-religious criminal groups also profit from reselling the goods), etc. 




 According to this news agency...but you can't really trust a local news agency to 100% accurately convey the original claim. I'd double check what they actually published in Dabiq. 




 You don't stoop. 




 Let's be real, after 10 years of chaos, almost none of the remaining artifacts are likely real. The good stuff is sitting in the private collections of wealthy individuals who took advantage of the situation. 




 Can someone give me, like a proper example to help me understand the term?

Orthodox Muslims get a rap among ignorant bigots in the West because of this concept which has nothing to do w/ 90% of most people claiming to be Muslim. The issue is that Twelver Shi'ites are in modern times a very substantial subset of the overall population and happen to be vocal in media and politics, and this concept is the bedrock of Twelver Shi'ism. [An example of taqiyyah in action:](http://arabic.al-khoei.org/falea.htm)

:                       
:       . 

That's from the website of al-Kho'i, a venerable mujtahid in modern Twelver religious tradition. He's being asked if it's permissible to lie in debates against "innovators" (non-12ers - i.e. one of the types of taqiyyah) and al-Khoi is clarifying that it is as long as it is useful in winning the debate.

Here's some narrations on the concept from Twelver Shi'ite religious tradition:

 The real things are probably in private collections and both ISIS/Baghdad have a bunch of replicas. 10 years of chaos will lose a lot of national treasure. 




 Well countries that have nukes aren't necessarily in good shape either. Pakistan is rife with special interests, targeted assassinations, terror attacks, general bursts of social unrest, etc. Even if Ukraine had nukes, Russia could and would cause problems if they were put in the same situation as they've been put in our reality. 




 If that's the harassment we know about...there's probably quite a bit more we don't know about. Don't see how this is an unreasonable basis for determining a motive towards this path for the man... 









 Really? I've seen it **multiple** times across LA (in Torrence) and beyond. They have a quarter to get in system. 




 It's depressing since this exact illusion keeps a good 50% of voters not acting in their self-interest and ultimately ruining the concept of democracy. 




 "We need peace, and clear skies"

 What does US have to do with anything?

A lot... 









 A radicalized anti-Russian Ukraine is better than a NATO member-state anti-Russian Ukraine on his border. Weighing his options, you have new strategic territory, supportive regions in ethnic Russian territory as a buffer and your neighbor state is no longer fit to approach and join NATO as it was aiming for a few years ago. 




 Academic polling iz 2 hard tho 




 Umm...that makes no sense. Islamic apocolyptic literature suggests that the people closest to that period of time will be the worst of human beings. If you're a 'radical', you want anything *but* Judgement day to come. 




 It's unreal when you think about it. They say that their aim is to create a massive Caliphate that stretches the globe, and yet they haven't built a single thing. They just maim and destroy everything like rabid animals.

The first thing you build is an army. You build an army by having people with nothing to do. When you burn books and music, people have nothing left to do. 




 Men who run off to ISIS at their age are given no mercy.

They should be too. Media + Pussy pass is a whole nother issue entirely imo.

If ISIS let these girls fight on the frontline and kill people, don't you think they would do it?

Maybe. And if you found me 10 years ago and asked me what drugs I was selling, you'd have a very different answer from than you have now. The point is to know about this issue, and put in measures to ensure that youth will *live long enough* to grow out of this phase and prevent them from ever *having an opportunity* to go out "on the frontline and kill people". 




 At what point do a people claim ownership of land? 

I don't think it's easy to come up with some sort of absolute for something like that, and I'm sure you agree. What I do believe though without a doubt is that anyone displaced, particularly anyone (or descendent of one) displaced who is presently getting by on scraps at a refuge camp has every right to go and reclaim their stolen property. That they have more right to the land they were expelled from than a people with a vague and messy notion of "Jewishness" and no provable near memory connection to the land.

Without a doubt, a lot of the Palestinians' ancestors came to the land from elsewhere.

Even if that were the case, there are plenty who are as indigenous as our history books go. Various tribes that the Prophet allegedly interacted with and 'Umar allegedly interacted with.

I also see a gigantic difference between invited, or at least not repelled, early migrants vs a Jew making aliyah in the early 1900s for the express purpose of clandestine political subversion. 

It's possible that Israelis and Palestinians, maybe in a few generations, can live together and respect each other's rights. 

It's possible. 




 And plenty of kids made bigger mistakes than you probably did in your sheltered life. Joining local gangs, stealing and killing in their own community, ending up dead locally or in jail, flying down to Vegas and getting forced to become hookers, etc.

They're still kids who made mistakes.

If you can't empathize with them, you're the only psychopath here. 




 They're young girls. They have about as much foresight as young girls you pull out of the club... 




 Who brought up non-Sunnis? Andy was asking why dhimma were being killed. 




  I don't think a huge percentage of blacks would say

It's not a numbers game. You said the only reason somebody would hurt you for being an annoying asshole and exercising speech is if they're insecure. I pointed out that being an annoying asshole can get you hurt/killed/"persecuted" anywhere and has nothing to do with insecurities...whether you're in Europe and you're academically questioning the Holocaust, or you're in Russia, Africa or pretty much any Eastern country and you mock religious icons or somebody's family, or you're an annoying white kid yelling nigger while walking through the bronx.... 




 If they pay their taxes, it becomes IS' duty as Muslims to protect them (like the Muslims in the territory they occupy) - assuming they still follow some aspects of Islam. But these aren't Moslawi Christians or Christians from other IS territories - [There are Christian enclaves and militias](http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/christian-foreign-fighters-deserting-kurdish-ypg-syria-because-theyre-damned-reds-1976493133) in cities beyond IS. 




 Except that immediately when they took Mosul various Sunni movements gave bayah including non-Salafis - even prominently jaysh naqshbandia, average sunna' from baiji, fallujah, mosul...feel free to pretend that's not what happened and Anbar was just a bunch of "Wahhabi" sleeper cells... 




 It's happening, but Israelis have a way of disconnecting with the crimes perpetrated on their behalf by the IDF. Anytime Palestinians suffer something barbaric by inhumane democratically elected government of the people of Israel, several Hasbara will come along and call it Pallywood, or come up with something to the effect of "well Americans do it too!" 




 He's correcting the statement "open discussions" in the post he's replying too... 




 I mean, where the hell did he get the prophet (pbuh)'s wanting to commit suicide because of his doubts on the Quran?

There's a ziyada through az-Zuhri on a hadith in Sahih al Bukhari which discussed suicidal inclination on one occasion. Not for doubt of the Qur'an, but I can see where he kind of started. 




 Not insecurities. If you walk around a poor black neighborhood in the US calling everybody "nigger", don't think you'll walk out alive or at least not have your ass whopped. It's not because people are insecure about being black - it's simply that they're not okay with you saying something like that.

If you go to any part of the world where mothers are valued (so much of the world outside of US/Europe), you will either die or get your ass whopped for making a harmless "yo mama" joke. Same thing. The guy who's mom you called a whore *knows* his mom is not a whore, he's not *insecure*, he's just not okay with you saying that...

Insecurity would be if the Muslims were as riled up about Haggarism (by Cooke and Crone) as they were by Salman Rushdie. There's a difference between questioning/criticizing something and mocking it - and Muslim empires historically recognized this difference. Nobody was punished for apologetic or argumentation.

I understand its hard to imagine, but not everybody has the same values as you and not everybody believes that people should be allowed to *say* whatever they want. Nobody can control your thoughts, but no country doesn't have some restrictions on what you're allowed to say. 




 And likewise there's countless cases of baseless propaganda by Shi'ites against the various anti-Bashar, anti-Iraq Military militias...

And likewise there's countless cases of actual barbarity by Shi'ite militias...to the point where even Moqtada al-sadr isn't even willing to roll with some of these guys...you can find several examples of torture and vicious killings by Shi'ite terrorists (before Daish started coming up as a uniting Sunni response in the region) in my old submissions (to r/iraq)... 




 I've said some stuff critical of some of the big things Seattle believes in (bikes, public transpo, homos, Murray, etc.) without being downvoted into oblivion. You can get away with articulating a counter-cultural point just fine. It's coming off as a complete idiot or a troll that doesn't work (and why you guys must have the opinions you do about the sub).... 




 I think he has a point as in millions of Israelis have been born on the land. 

I didn't say he doesn't have a point - I just don't believe assuming a state surrounded by enemies can exist indefinitely, or for any substantial period of time, is a good basis to 'move forward' on. That said, its not like the Crusaders didn't have children and influx of occupiers/"emigrants" when they occupied Palestine either. The only difference is the number.

They call it home and they would do whatever it takes to fight for it.

Calling a place home doesn't mean you'll do "whatever it takes" to fight for it - even if we assume that the children of thieves have the right to keep stolen property as their own. 




  If both of those really wanted it, Vietnam or Afghanistan would be utterly destroyed like Germany was 70 years ago.

If you don't believe we really wanted it in Vietnam, you don't remember Vietnam. That failure happened in spite of a wanton disregard for human life and destruction on a massive scale. As I said, that doesn't win wars...you have an advantage if you can level cities at a time, but that doesn't mean you'll walk away having completed what you set out to do...

 You also don't mention that in those proxy wars all involved countries were armed by the rival side: Afghan Mujahideens armed by USA, Vietnam armed by Russia   China, etc ... 

Actually - I basically did: "using antiquated outside technology...using antiquated Russian arms" - its not like the US gave F16s to the Mujahideen or the Ukranians...the technology they used in winning that war (and the subsequent ones) is for the most part no better than the crappiest arsenal held by an Iranian or Pakistani army group... 




 Technology has *always* been important in wars. It doesn't win wars. As the Russians call them, "goat herders" drove out the Soviets with nominal and antiquated outside technology. A technologically in-superior Viet-Cong drove out the USA. Today, Taliban controls substantial swathes outside of Kabul in Afghanistan after the war. A separatist movement in Ukraine using antiquated Russian arms is fighting a relatively successful war against a modern Ukranian army.

Evidence 1   2 aren't directly relevant to military development.

Evidence 3, assuming the iron shield is actually what its proponents claim, is definitely an impressive logistical feat. It's not exactly new technology though, the tools to intercept crude Hamas/Hezbollah type rockets (and better) is widely available in much of the world. You have advance warning sure - and effectiveness against this one very particular type of scenario -Qassams coming out of Palestine. If the Muslim world operated with some semblance of a homogenous unit in the next 100 years, you're now dealing with a hatf or something else less susceptible to what your ABF is tested against...

Your military development is earmarked to handle the very specific scenarios you expect well - its not like you lot are set up for something unexpected, and that's what I alluded to. The Crusaders didn't imagine Salah-ud-Din. They effectively handled the things they knew, but that doesn't prepare you against a surprise 50 years later.

And military development isn't everything either. You guys are amazing at leveling entire apartment complexes and cities, sure. But when IDF finally sent in ground forces, it wasn't exactly a cake-walk, and that's with air-support and a pretty no fucks given attitude to the destruction of life and property in the territory you were occupying. Imagine "terror tunnels" that open in major cities with 100s of Palestinian soldiers fighting the same urban war from within your own cities. You can't just level the buildings. The technology that works so well in destroying hospitals, schools, water sanitation and electrical plants isn't going to help in that environment.

I understand your investment and your hope that the Zionist experiment lasts indefinitely. I'm just not seeing any substantial reason to truly believe you can sustain a country, for any lengthy period of time, surrounded by people who support the indigenous people you've oppressed. At some point, the many battle-hardened Libyans, Egyptians, Iraqis, Somalis, Yemenis and Syrians who are busy killing each other right now (an absolute blessing for Israel) may redirect their anger. It's happened before... 




 He gave an *analogy* of a racist regime of the past who's people thought it would last indefinitely to a modern apartheid government. What does this have to do with *Jews*... 




 This whole discussion is irrelevant, because Israel is not going to disappear. 

The Crusaders occupied Jerusalem for over 100 years, and several generations. What makes you so sure the indigenous people and their brothers nearby won't eventually find a way to work together and send you packing? It's happened before... 




 inshaAllah 




 Forces that will likely be one day shooting at you. Fleeing soldiers aren't an interdiction of enemy forces either, nothing imminent, but historically armies attempt to kill and capture people as they run away as well. Soldiers sleeping in barracks, etc. etc. etc. To put it as you do, no one expect they would be bombed sleeping. No one expects they would be bombed taking a shit.

They're still soldiers. 




  Because it was a fucking political rally. No one expect they would be bombed walking down the street of their own city. There is no excuse for this...

So if somebody in military gear is at a political rally, they're off limits during a war? 




 Well it's not a theological issue - it's a fiqh issue. If we go down to the very simplest understanding of the question, is there a legitimate opinion allowing qisas (retribution) of this nature if the family of the victims ask for it? Sure.

That isn't to say anything about this group, their legitimacy, their ruling over the man, whether the man deserved it, if a pilot's job is comparable (allowing this as qisas), the wisdom of doing it in this way, whether the video was real, whether the pilot is under the rules of a POW or a criminal, etc. 




 Yea it's definitely weird. They were pretty explicit too:

 The footage was faked.

 




 So you agree that ISIS are in fact Muslims but you disagree that they are rooted in Islam? 

The ISIS foot soldiers appear to be Muslim.

And I'm not a relativist at all but when you have are dealing with written sources it often becomes impossible to speak in objective truths. 

For things which are open to interpretation, sure. Stuff like whether to fold your arms above the navel, below the navel (etc.) in prayer are open to interpretation. Textual evidence isn't clear. That's the spectrum. But this is what you said, "who are you to decide what the objectively correct version of Islam is"

If somebody comes along and says, "well sure, Islam teaches this publicly, but Islam was actually transmitted in secret and the true religion was transmitted through a small subset of 'Muslims' and contradicts the openly available and multiply transmitted information" (as a simplification of 12er Shi'ism) - than you can pretty easily say it's not Islam, or not "authentic" Islam. If somebody comes along and says "Here's Qur'an 2.0 - this is Islam, again, easy call.

Likewise, if you have somebody that says Islam allows or encourages stuff like homosexuality, or killing anyone you choose at random, both of which are explicitly prohibited in the source texts - you can objectively say that this is not an 'objectively correct version of Islam'

Permit me a flippant example, there is a legitimate argument to say that Gatsby (of The Great Gatsby fame) was actually African-American. Can anyone objectively say one way or the other? And who is the final judge on such matters? Admitting the impossibility of objective truth in some situations is not a withdrawal into relativism.

And that example is fine, and it addresses differences of opinion in issues where there is an availability of interpretive leeway. Stuff like the details associated with prayer and other things. But you don't need a judge to tell you the incorrectness of someone espouseing values that contradict the dhahir (obvious) meaning of certain verses, as understood in context through chains of tutelage that go back to the Prophet. There's plenty of open issues that Islam accommodates differences of opinion in, even explicit texts which allow for such differences. I only took issue with the broad idea that nobody can objectively say something is or is not "Islamic" when there is abundant source texts which can be understood in context and have had a unanimous interpretation. 




 I didn't criticize OP for simply editorializing - I criticized him because of "BS editorializ[ing]" - the editorialization is not supported by the article itself as Prystaiko doesn't in any way admit that Ukraine wasn't serious about the cease fire....

There's a difference between simply editorializing and flat out lying. If you can't comprehend that difference, I can't help you. 




 We're on the same page, Putin explicitly negotiated the ceasefire so that the rebels could settle Debaltseve without violating the agreement. That said - OP is editorializing the title like crazy. 




  international scientific consensus that we were heading into an ice age

**The scientific community had no consensus at the time**, there wasn't enough data...averages over a 30 year period isn't (and wasn't) proof of a trend...

http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914494,00.html

What we have today is an actual consensus, with substantial data - not just media picking up and fear mongering both possibilities (as in the 70s)... 




 The footage was faked. 




 Average Sunni Muslims vs IS Types vs Shi'ites vs Secular Kurds vs NATO vs Russia

Israel kicking back with a beer at the beach and watching explosions in the distance. 




 Except its not racial. Anybody can join ISIS! 




  ISIS is rooted in a literal and very uncompromising tradition of Islam.

A literal and very uncompromising tradition of Islam allows burning to death of POWs? This is news to me. Given that there are explicit traditions literally prohibiting burning people to death.

In any case - I didn't say I have a problem with the idea that ISIS lot are Muslims until proven otherwise (theologically). I simply pointed out that there's a fundamental flaw in your modern Western approach to Islam, "all interpretations are valid, there are no objective truths", etc. The spectrum can be defined as whatever fits within the context of the vast set of undisputed Islamic sources. It's not something grey. 




 Welcome to /r/worldnews... 




 Last I checked Allah has no Air Force and an army of peasants with 30yr old ak47s so desperate to escape a life of poverty and boredom they blow themselves up.

Isn't that what the Soviets said in Afghanistan? And what the US said in Iraq 2.0, Afghanistan...

If those were military victories in your mind, you really need to re-assess what winning is. 




  Their radical messianic/apocalyptic stances

What stances are these? Dabiq? Their interpretation of that being in the near future isn't a theological difference imo 




 A well-edited video with a "specific leader" (literally somebody who nobody who's a somebody knows) isn't evidence of a centralized organization with a wide breadth of control. 




 What I'm saying is that there is no way to arbitrate this dispute between interpretations.

Yes there is, interpretation is on a spectrum. Eventually you can fall outside of that spectrum. If somebody comes along and tells you "I'm a communist" and than goes on to expound on the nature of his belief in free-market capitalism, it's pretty obvious they're not communists. The same applies to Islam. You can have wonky Shi'ite sects for example, but if they're stepping beyond the source texts - there is no theological issue in establishing takfir... 




 I would argue that licences should be distributed to all affected (or should I say infected) countries granting them impunity when dealing with these monsters.

So basically, let's keep the cycle going...

'Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster' - Nietzche

Even these IS **people** are only the product of what they've collectively experienced. People like you, if you weren't a keyboard soldier, are the exact sort of people that join IS (or the other militias - depending entirely on your location of birth) - quite literally the entire problem in al sham right now...
