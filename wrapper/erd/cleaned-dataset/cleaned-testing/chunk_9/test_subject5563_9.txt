 Does Sony always get this advertisement space? I haven't seen anything non Playstation related on that space in a while.  




 Agree, that top down camera as the riders fly down the main straight is beautiful.  




 Brilliant 




 Pretty crazy to see that back then and see [this](http://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/bmw-i8-test-drive-review-75.jpg) today. The car is the BMW i8 for those wondering.  




 Do you really think they are going to follow those rules? 




 Ah I didn't do the drawing unfortunately, my talent is the ability to be as useless as possible when it comes to drawing. Here's the artists page http://nathandearsley.blogspot.co.uk/ 




 You will like this promotional video for Hankook showing their idea of the tyres in the future https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zu7GVfx6Ng 




 To this day I still don't know whether it was staged or real.  




 I wish mate, that was the only pit stop drawing from the artist.

 To be fair I wouldn't be totally against it as it did bring a fuck ton of money into the sport.

 Oh wow, guess this explains why he has never been able to make another film.  




 Why is that? 




 Final Destination 3D is the movie with the human meat grinder escalator 




 The show isn't out yet...perhaps that's why you cannot watch it.  




 so I have to wonder, wouldn't it get really tiring controlling the pod racer, considering your arms are always in upwards position? 




 Wait aren't Charlie Day and that other scientist dude also in Pacific Rim? 




 Oh wow, I didn't realise that Doberman's had naturally floppy ears, thought they were always pointy. Sucks that people mutilate them for their own vanity.  




 Is there any reason to crop the ears? 




 Are the books worth reading? Considering I love the game so far.  




 I know that feel, I remember when I bought my car back in 2012 and a few days later I saw a tiny dent on the passenger door.  




 Merchandise 




 I never understood this joke, can someone explain it? 




 Looks like they were filming a scene for a movie.  




 "You will go to sleep or I will put you to sleep..." 




 It's just so poorly edited, you have no idea what is going on when the main character is fighting anyone, and this isn't shakycam it's actually the editing, it feels so off. I feel the main reason for this is because it was PG-13 along with Taken 2 which had bad editing as well. Such a shame because if both films were still R-rated then we probably wouldn't have this shitty editing.  









 For a more recent big budget film I would say Taken 3. Man that was a struggle to watch.  




 "still learning".... 




 Meet the cop who can't be stopped.  




 You ain't seen Bad Boys 2?

EDIT: why would someone give me gold. 




 That's fucked up OP, sorry for the theft :( Some people, especially the ones with punchable faces are massive cunts. Hopefully you get your equipment back.  




 Well Tyrions cock didn't get sold to the cock merchant...yet.  




 I was 11 years old when this came out and I remember watching it at home and crying when they left him in the forest. I was afraid my parents would do the same to me :/ 




 I get that there are monetary incentives but wasn't the game crowdfunded? If someone who runs an AMD card pledged money to the developer and then the developer goes and takes this monetary incentive which they know will segregate those who have an AMD card, then isn't that developer ethically obliged to reject the NVIDIA's offer?  




 Some clubs here in Sydney have a $20 cover charge. I'm gonna assume a lot of the big nightclubs in major cities a have a hefty cover charge on weekends.  




 Can someone explain why people collapse the way they do when shot? It's so different compared to what movies and television show us. 




 indoor soccer 




 According to IMDB he is born in Kashmir, India. So yeah pretty cool. 




 Dat RT score tho 




 Stupid question but does insurance cover this? 




 AVP: Requiem (the sequel) was. Not the first AVP film.  




 Maybe if the game is received poorly they can avoid all the victory related puns/headlines that will go alongside it lol 




 I think the game on your own can be a bit of a grind but supposedly the best way to experience it is by joining an active corporation (guild) since i assume they all help each other out to unload the grind a bit.  




 Konami took down their own E3 conference this year. 




 Depends how cool the trailer and music is.  




 Lol mate you have to be joking. AoU was nowhere near as bad as you remember it. Yeah that scene where he walks up to an old John Deere tractor they don't even sell anymore which is contextually located in it's natural habitat, A FARM, combined with his character making a snarky pun... Or that 2 second shot of Quicksilver grabbing Adidas shoes out of his closet? Your examples suck and the fact that you tried to say that the product placement in AoU wasn't as bad as Transformers shows why no one has taken your opinion seriously. 

Take your [pill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4YwLlB9daM) and rethink your argument.  




 To be honest the product placement in AoU wasn't THAT bad. It's only obvious if you try to notice it in my opinion. The absolute worst offender is still Transformers 4, the "Beats Pill" product placement was just absurd.  




 Did I just see Ari Gold throwing meat at a bunch of hippies? 




 Cheaper to air reruns than produce their own content I assume.  




 I'll never understand why they cast non-australians in that role. 




 BOOM 




 He has an eye infection and the doctors said that he has to avoid exposing it to artificial light.  




 Also a good time to bust out that Oakley sponsorship. 




 Obligatory, The Grey. This wasn't a bad thing however. 




 Well to be honest I am extremely excited for both, however Mad Max comes out next week where as Star Wars comes out right at the end of the year, so I think in a few months the tune will change.  




 I really like what the Wachowskis do, even if their films can be quite flawed at times, I have still enjoyed them all. This show looks really good and hopefully they can get whatever ideas they have down better in a TV format. 




 To be honest I wasn't hating the film, up until near the end when 
 SPOILERS

Dave Francos character crashes his car on the bridge, it was so stupid how he didn't "die" and escaped that. Also the reveal that Ruffalo was the last horseman was stupid as well. 




 I agree, I just hate having to reference the movie so my friends get a visual understanding :/ 




 Chances are that it may be quite expensive to license any Pink Floyd song.  




 [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W85mbsD_5_U) for ze lazy 




 Same here! I really thought they should have capitalised on the different houses/corporations and what they owned, the drama between the warring houses would have been much more interesting than the story of the two main leads.  




 I thought it was an Oculus rift or an oculus (mirror). 




 Why? Just get a dock for your phone if you want to use it in traffic, the law states that you cannot hold it in your hand or on your lap unless the car is parked on the road and the ignition is off. Last thing we need is more people NOT paying attention to their surroundings while in traffic. All it takes is one person at the lights who sees it has gone from green to yellow and then takes off at the intersection and causes an accident.  




 ***YES*** 




 For clothing you could always have a look at [ACRONYM](http://www.acrnm.com/). They are expensive however, but from doing some light forum browsing, the quality seems to be worth the price.  




 Yeah sucks man :( I was fortunate enough that the PS3 version had all the DLC minus The Arrival since that came out after I believe. But to still charge full price for the DLC in this game is frustrating to say the least.  




 This baffles me so much, I owned ME2 on PS3 but bought it on PC again for better graphics/framerate etc, however the DLC is still ridiculously priced and it has never gone on sale.  




 Really? Although some of the Roger Moore films were entertaining, he looked way over the age a Bond should be. Not to mention during his stint we got some of the most absurd Bond films *ahem* MOONRAKER. 




 I'm not sure whether you understand just how difficult it is to do backwards compatibility with the new gen consoles, considering their architecture vastly differs from the previous generation of consoles.  




 Awesome edit, it also hilariously highlights how bad the lightsaber battles in the OT are compared to the prequels. Makes it look like the lightsabers in OT are claymores compared to a more Katana like weight in the prequels.  




 Also Hersh did a selfless act towards the end, I haven't seen Control do any such act.  




 I think Control will die mainly because her character itself is pretty fucking evil, kidnapping people, torture etc. However I feel she will die whilst helping Team Machine.  




 Was the show doing well in ratings before it was cancelled? 




 So legit question, what do you do to NOT piss it off? 




 It's super expensive to make unfortunately. Look at Final Fantasy: Spirits Within, it was a more mature animated film which pushed the boundaries of computer animation, but in the end it bombed. Now there's a variety of factors as to why it bombed (which may have been prevented) but it was a very expensive bomb which seems to have had a lasting effect on the green lighting of these types of projects.  




 I guess the soundtrack to Alien Isolation is pretty damn close since it uses similar themes to the film. 




 The look on Martin Scorceses face at the end says it all.

 Most MCU one's are in my opinion. The best marvel property posters are the ones FOX made for The Wolverine.
Check out:

EDIT: Yes i realise that wolverine isn't MCU 




 Oh wow that's a big one, never saw this poster thankfully.  




 I dunno, even in the shitbox Ferrari he had last year he was able to pull off some amazing manoeuvres, so if the Mclaren is awesome next season, then I think he could be at the top again.   




 Don't get me wrong Hamilton is a great driver as well but he is almost always at the front  with quite a margin, so I feel we don't get to see him do too much in the way of defending or overtaking (at least for now).  




 So we see trailers that more than often end up spoiling a film, but are there any posters that have spoiled a movie in a particular way?  




 His overtakes were sublime

[Hungary w/commentary from Ricciardo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfb3vbBfLW0)

[Ric faking and overtaking Vettel in Monza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9zC-95bzv8)

[Ric overtaking Alonso in America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5dC7VA0Vjo)

He just put on too good of a show in that car last year, he was always doing something interesting.  




 umm, yay? 




 Might be because the Batman V Superman trailer was already scheduled to be released, while this one isn't.  




 I think [this](https://www.facebook.com/thebucketlistlife/timeline) is it.  




 Fuck those are some expensive Shapes.  




 Would they be allowed do that? 




 Damn one more lap and Kimi could have won, still a phenomenal race to watch.  




 omgggg 




 Maldonado is the bad luck Brian of this year's season 




 Bottas sounded like a bot in that transmission
 




 Grace Bros still exists in Australia? I thought they all became Myer? 




 I have a feeling Tomorrowland and Fantastic Four will underperform.  




 The main issue with making a Bioshock film is that the main character doesn't speak. Unless the film is a prequel of some sorts to the first game, then it may be a very hard film to write.  




 Paraphrase, "compared to another engine manufacturer who has been in the game for one year, our problems aren't that bad" 




 JB taking a jab at Renault haha 




 Verstappen, assassinating Maldanado lol 




 This, the active red button also makes it awesome. I swear the engine noise sounds better on the driver cam than it does in the regular coverage.  




 Ah I see, TIL. Is Martini not a title sponsor for Williams, or is it a Sahara Force India situation?
 




 backstory? 




 Mclaren don't have a title sponsor on their car, and while I assume they still make enough money from their other technologies to fund F1, surely not having a title sponsor is impacting their funding in some way right?  




 Luckily most of the European leg is watchable. The only races that will be tough for us are USA, Mexico and Brazil.  




 [Official countdown](http://starwars.ea.com/starwars/battlefront) 




 I just remember like 2 years ago there was just a placeholder date of 2015. So at the time you had all of these films + Avatar 2 releasing which made it even more ridiculous at the time.  




 I remember a while back that Avatar 2 was also planned to come out this year as well.  




 I don't think it's gonna be R...it's a huge budget film, which many children will be watching. To put it in perspective, The pirates trilogy was also PG-13 and it had some pretty dark things in it.  




 Feels weird, has the film grain been removed? It kind of looks a bit too fake, much like The Hobbit.
