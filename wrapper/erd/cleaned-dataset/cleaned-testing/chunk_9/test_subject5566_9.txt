 Hey Sev,

Great feedback - thanks a lot!

Picking a domain was a difficult decision. I'd like to buy the .com domain eventually but for the time being I'm bootstrapping so I'd rather start to build a community first. The reason I picked the .io domain was to first appeal to the techy-foodies but you're right that it could be a barrier to non-techies who tend not to trust non-standard domain names.

A lot of people fed back to me that they thought the site is cluttered. I've added a small amount of padding around the images like you suggested and a few other changes which hopefully helps for the time being. I'll continue to make changes and play around with things to make the site a clean and user-friendly as possible.

I'm also tempted to move the search bar (or I call it the panel) over to the right hand side. The only issue with that is I think mobile users are used to having a menu button in the top left-hand corner...what do you think?

Thanks again for your great feedback!
Joe 




 Thanks for your feedback!
I really like your idea of switching the price and cuisine around - I've now made that change to the live site and made a couple of other changes to make the website feel a bit cleaner (particularly on desktop).
I think the website could still be made cleaner but the current changes are a start. I'm currently a one man band and design is not my area so your feedback is really valued. 




 Hey oCheesus,

Thanks for your feedback!

I'm a one man band at the moment having coded it, designed it and now marketing it all myself. I did most of the work over the Easter bank holiday in the UK. But as you can see, I do not have a natural design ability. Eventually, I'd like to get more people involved that specialise in those areas.

I like the point system or giving users some sort of reward for their submissions. I'm a big fan of product hunt and I think I might take inspiration from their site to add photos and names of users next to each submission (or something similar).

I made a couple of changes to the UI last night based on feedback I received on reddit. Hopefully it's a little cleaner (particularly on desktop). Still further to go but let me know what you think in the meantime. 









 Hey everyone,


I've just released [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) into an incredibly crowded space. There are a couple of things I want to achieve with [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) to make it different to the competition.


They are:

* Every restaurant on [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) needs to be amazing

* [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) will be powered by the foodie community by enabling users to post great restaurants to the site

* I want to make an incredible user experience similar to City Mapper where things are simple and just work.

There's still quite a way to go and [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) has only been released in London so far but I'd love your feedback on the user experience and any advice on the best way to grow the community of foodies.



Thanks,

Joe
