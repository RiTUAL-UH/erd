 Later on in his speech, Sanders talks about how many Americans are working more than 40 hours a week. If we don't need people to produce, why are we putting in so many hours?  




 That would mean about1 person out of 30 in the area attended the Bernie Sanders speech.  I know there must have been out of town attendees and it is hyper-political progressive Madison, but still, that's a pretty impressive percentage of the area population at any event. 




 And Honda Fit's.  Suddenly every third driveway in my neighborhood has a Honda Fit. 




 I'd say it took about 20 years for gay marriage to go from a fringe issue to mainstream acceptance.  I'd expect the polygamists have some work ahead of them. 




 I think Tom Coburn (former Republican Senator OK) [summed up](http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/tom-coburn-on-2016-gopers-cruz-and-walker-not-ready-for-prim#.oq0jRkpnQ) the Wisconsin recall the best.

Coburn said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is not ready for primetime in my opinion. He said Walker didnt win the recall election in 2012 but Republicans around the country did it for him.

Wisconsin was flooded with outsider money which propped up Walker.  That and a lack of decent Democratic candidates to oppose him.  




 I hope he is.  I was there. Who do I speak to about my check? 




 These sorts of crowds aren't unusual for Madison. 30,000 came to see Obama in 2012. **80,000** people showed up to see John Kerry in 2004. OK, it was John Kerry and Bruce Springsteen, but still, Madison is a great place if you're a progressive Democrat and want a big turnout. 




 Or perhaps he's a Democratic plant ...  Look I just started my own conspiracy theory. 




 Indeed, early in the negotiating process with Walker, union leaders said they would concede to his demands for higher employee contributions to pensions and health care if he would drop his insistence on gutting collective bargaining. The governor said no.

It was never about money.  It was about reducing the power of groups that support Democrats. 




 Citing a department study, Bratton has said that he doesn't believe the large drop in stop and frisk activity -- from nearly 700,000 in 2011 to about 47,000 in 2014 -- had any impact on the shooting increase last year. 

I'd say most of this article supports, rather than refutes the conclusion reached by Washington Post. 
  




 Vote for Scott Walker -  because you don't want any rights or protections at work !!! 




 They're going to get their instructions and [boilerplate legislation](http://www.prwatch.org/news/2015/02/12743/wisconsin-introduces-verbatim-alec-right-work-bill).  




 Walker might even have trouble carrying [Wisconsin](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walkers-wisconsin-approval-rating-drops-in-latest-poll-b99482677z1-300128921.html). He hasn't been doing himself any favors back home recently, and while Wisconsin skews right in off year elections (when he won his elections), it skews left in Presidential election years, when people like Tammy Baldwin get elected easily. 




 He should. It would give him a good cover for some of his more inane pronouncements.  "I'm sorry I said that, but I was totally baked". 




 I wouldn't be surprised if he got that many, or close to it.  Progressives in Wisconsin are a bit keyed up by events over the last 6 years or so. Also it's Madison. 




 With his wife?  I'm guessing they had either a very short or a very solid marriage. 




 For me , it was mostly just listening enough to get familiar with his music. Some years ago I had a long commute and and old car with a broken radio.  I had a copy of Free Jazz in the car, which I though was OK, but pretty strange. But for the entire week I kept forgetting to bring another cassette out to the car, so I probably listened to Free Jazz nine or ten times , and by the end of the week I couldn't remember why I'd thought it was weird.  

The analogy I use for Ornette Coleman (or other forms of outre music) is to compare it to painting.  If you went to a museum and were expecting to see realistic visual representation and found yourself in a roomful of say, Jackson Pollock and Paul Klee, you'd probably think.  What is this crap, these guys can't even draw.  But if you spend some time with it , you realize they've decided to take the art materials and do something completely different, something with it's own logic that is completely different from representational art.  I think Ornette Coleman more or less reinvented jazz music, the way some visual artists reinvented painting.  (Don't take this analogy too far or it starts to break down.)  




 That was probably a good rule. Some years ago I was on a business trip in San Antonio and was at a place across the River Walk from Dick's.  Some of the patrons at Dick's  were dressed up as giant condoms and most of the rest seemed unsteady and boisterously drunk. At eight o'clock in the evening. On a Tuesday. 




 I think Jindal is not seriously running for President. I think he's auditioning for a Fox News commentator spot. 




 Can't they both be right? 




 I have matches !!  Go ahead, take 'em.
 




 No one wants to live in a country where the government coerces people to act in opposition to their conscience.

Such as being forced to pay taxes for an illegal war in Iraq? 




 Dale Knapp, research director for the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said the states current budget woes are in great measure self-induced. Walker and Republican allies in the Legislature gave themselves no cushion for error in their bet that broad tax cuts would jump-start the states economy and more than pay for themselves.  When the new projections didnt materialize, we put ourselves into a hole, Knapp said.

Tax cuts pay for themselves - the conservatives most enduring fantasy.   









 Indeed, the reasoning is flawless and the sourcing is thorough. 




 Or some gun owners might decide to join up with the invaders. Can't say it will or won't happen, but groups deciding to side with the invaders has happened often enough in history.  




 In explaining the weighting of categories, to some degree, Minnesota benefits from a trend that we have sought to reflect in our study this year, the network said. Rather than just seeking the lowest taxes or the highest incentives, companies are increasingly chasing the largest supply of skilled, qualified workers.

So, the quality of your employees is more important than low taxes and  wages?  Hey Walker , Brownback , Jindal , et.al  - You're doing it wrong! 




 Judicial tyranny in this context means 'a decision Mike Huckabee disagrees with'. 




 A juvenile, yet completely accurate comment. 




 They were named after a song by [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6UMtWi5rX0), who was a pretty good songwriter himself. 




 Scott Walker 2016 - Hypocrisy without Limits 

I'm seeing a campaign slogan here

 




 I think the mono-culture started breaking up earlier, in the 70s.  I don't remember any radio stations playing, oh say , David Bowie, P-Funk and the Doobie Brothers. Although I would have listened to one if they did. 




 It's a subtle difference, but ISIS is destroying ancient and irreplaceable archaeological sites, which is not quite the same thing as objecting to the display of a replica of of a 19th century flag.  But  anybody could get those two mixed up.  




 A bit rich, coming from the guy who [stated](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/in-film-walker-talks-of-divide-and-conquer-strategy-with-unions-8o57h6f-151049555.html) his strategy against unions was to "divide and conquer". 




 A small price to pay to protect their freedoms! 









 And don't forget about [this problem](http://www.vox.com/2015/6/22/8824579/lancet-comission-climate-change). 




 Hey Matt, right now Rand Paul is at [20/1 odds](http://www.paddypower.com/bet/politics/other-politics/us-politics?ev_oc_grp_ids=791149) to win the Presidency. Why don't you put your money up and collect on a big payday? 




 Scott Walker - the billionaires' best boy.  




 Blaming the poor - a political trick that never seems to fail. 




 Unfortunately, that attitude is limited to neither high school or Reddit. 




 I'm guessing that they want an excuse to go on a fact finding trip someplace warm. 




 Deciding when a citizen needs to be denied his rights and removed from society is one of the most important decision a government makes, and a corporations profit or loss should not be a part of it. 




 Sometimes, like in the quote above, I find myself cheering Paul on, thinking "Someone is finally showing some courage and making sense". And other times, say when he presented his tax plan, I think "This guy is dishonest or an imbecile".  Does Rand Paul have this effect on anyone else? 




 Ted Cruz , always a master of [good taste and timing](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/03/ted-cruz-joe-biden_n_7507284.html). 




 But illegally sold or obtained. 




 And Scott Walker will be telling us that ISIS is trembling in fear because he busted the school teachers unions. 




 I'm really looking forward to Paul Rand and Donald Trump exchanging ideas at the next Republican debate.  




 It's a bit [more complicated](http://www.factcheck.org/2012/12/gun-rhetoric-vs-gun-facts/) than that. 




 Straw purchases and corrupt dealers seem to be the most common ways for criminals to obtain guns. Stolen guns are less common. [Source](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/guns/procon/guns.html) 




 Or for that matter, how many crimes are committed using a gun that don't involve killing the the victim? Intimidation with a gun can work both ways.

Edit:  Found one [source](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/GUIC.PDF) for the information, although it's pretty dated. But 20 years ago, 
 According to the Victim Survey (NCVS), 25% of the victims of rape and sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault in 1993 faced an offender armed with a handgun. Of all firearm-related crime reported to the
survey, 86% involved handguns. 




 And to complete the insult, Walker is handing out [free money to 'job creators'.](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/state-jobs-agency-gave-loans-credits-to-firms-without-financial-review-b99523031z1-308521291.html) 




  itll be interesting to see how the Catholic GOP presidential candidates react to what is basically a searing indictment of their entire worldview. (Dibs on the campaign slogan Debris, Desolation   Filth: Vote Republican.)

They'll handle it fine.  What's one more bit of hypocrisy? 




 I think there's another reason.  Admitting mistakes requires some emotional maturity.  




 What I want to know is what it will take for Brownback to admit his 'experiment' has produced negative results? 









 And Scott Walker wants to [take it away](http://www.politicususa.com/2015/03/28/wisconsin-eliminating-weekends-koch-idea-nation-slave-labor.html).  




 Gun violence is the US is [eight times higher than in Canada. ](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/depending-how-advanced-is-defined-obama-was-right-about-gun-violence-2015-06-18). They don't have the same problem as the US has. 

 




 John, John, John. Putting the needs of your constituents ahead of ideology?  It's simply not done.  




 Seems to me the Pope wants us to be less greedy and more concerned about the inadvertent harm we cause the world's poor by warming the planet?  Wouldn't we be better people if we did that?   




 I like to imagine a big sign on the border greeting the tourists from Illinois.  Visit Wisconsin's lakes and woods!  Now with more toxins and pollutants! 




 Not to mention this [one] (http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-wont-comment-on-camerons-disputing-statements-b99521441z1-307893591.html). Walker is really a lying sack of cheese curds. I don't think he'll hold up any real scrutiny.  




 I'm with you there.  Some of his pieces could be used for audio torture (Einstein on the Beach) and some of them (Aknaten and his [String Quartets](http://www.amazon.com/Performs-Philip-Glass-KRONOS-QUARTET/dp/B000005J35) ) are  among my favorite pieces of music. 




 Absolutely.  I try to up vote people who disagree with me if they're making a genuine contribution to the discussion.  (Although I'll admit I don't always live up to this standard.) 




 It's just like the Nazis treated the Jews in Germany before WWII ... because the slightest imposition on or criticism of conservatives is always just like Nazi Germany. 




 She's certainly no Bernie Sanders, but compared to what we'll get if Scott Walker and Paul Ryan are free to reshape the laws and economy, ... shudder. 




 I particularly like the quadrant graphic, showing how Clinton is trying to get the voters to perceive her.  Wealthy doesn't mean you serve only your own class, and coming from modest circumstances doesn't prevent you from being a toady to the rich. 









 Hillary is lame. It it's scandals you want, [Scott Walker](http://scottwalkerwatch.com/) has accomplished a lot more in just a few years as Wisconsin governor.  




 Making it harder on the poor and easier for the rich. How all these putative Christians legislators justify their actions is beyond me.  I'm almost certain Jesus said we were supposed to the opposite.  




 Walker has left a trail of slime a mile long.  His history of corruption and dishonesty really needs to become national news.  




 One truly stunning thing about Coleman was how many years he made great and innovative music.  His brilliant album, The Shape of Jazz to Come was released in 1959, and the Pulitzer Prize winning Sound Grammar came out in 2006, 47 years apart.  Who else, in any genre, made great music for 47 years? 




 Indeed.  But we sure were fortunate to have him for as long as we did.  Coleman was one of the most important musicians/composers in jazz history, on the level with Armstrong and Parker. 




 Sound Grammar. Coleman's great late album.  




 Republicans do prefer strong leaders. 




 Eventually, they'll figure out that the party that's concerned about the 'job creators' will do nothing for the 'job holders'. 




 As he watches the early days of the Republican primary unfold, he sees candidates speaking out on poverty and showing compassion, a departure from previous cycles, particularly 2012, where he recalls many candidates forgetting the conservative heart.

And I'll bet he said it with a straight face. 




 They won't find a better puppy to server their purposes then 'Scottie' Walker. 




 Wisconsin has a large tourist industry and this can only help.  'Visit Wisconsin's great outdoors.  Now with more toxins and pollutants!' 




 Hound Dog Taylor.  Because I imagine your uncle could use cheering up and nobody in blues was more fun than the Dog. 




 And the economic value the University of Wisconsin brings to the state?  Somehow Walker never seems to mention it. 




 Here's an idea.  Legislators should put their duties to the electorate ahead of their pledges to a lobbyist.  Think it will catch on? 




 Well a real fox preys on "birds and small mammals like squirrels, rabbits and mice. A large part of the red fox's diet is made up invertebrates like crickets, caterpillars, grasshoppers, beetles and crayfish." . That list of animals is a pretty good metaphor for the Fox News audience. 




 Then I'd guess you'd agree that Walker's promise that his policies would create 250K jobs in Wisconsin was also asinine. 




 Privatization is the slipperiest form of crony capitalism.  Obscene payments under the guise of providing a service.
 




 50%.  I don't believe I've ever heard anyone state the number is that high. Perhaps you could show us your calculations. 




 While Fox News is busy [smartening everybody up](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/28/donald-trump-for-president-why-billionaires-candidacy-is-no-joke.html) on the crucial events. 




 Interesting.  How much of your money is spent on those items? 




 The conservative view on government funding is: There's always a reason why 'those' people shouldn't get anything, but my need is different and deserving.   




 I'll bet Paul Ryan (R-Wis, and head of House Ways and Means) is still saying his supply side incantations. It's not going away quickly.  




 I was thinking more along the lines of buildings or statues. 




 [Eric Dolphy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cimpUKVAbY8). Ought to be more memorials to him. 




 I think Rubio just wrapped up the surrealist vote. 




 The most rigorous research study availablepublished in 2011 by the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute and conducted by Heidi Shierholz (now the chief economist of the U.S. Department of Labor) and Elise Gouldcontrolled for 42 variables. **It found that right-to-work laws result in lower wages and a lower likelihood of health care and pensions for union and non-union workers.** It also shows right-to-work laws have no impact on economic growth.

Working as planned, I'd say.
 









 I do wish more people realized the number physical and economic problems lower class parents face.  You can read a lot of twaddle written by respected columnists (especially one named David Brooks) about how their problems are caused by moral failings or inability to plan long term and misses the obvious issues in the lives of poor families . 




 Christ almighty, is there anything more short sighted than skimping on education?  Hey Repubs, you want America to be able to compete in a globalized world?  You want an economy that can support you in your retirement?  No? Well then you're on the right track. 




 Rep. Craig Gagnon (R-Abbeville) is now my favorite Republican. 




 I wasn't intending any criticism of your business. I don't anything about landscaping business in Texas (or anywhere else for that matter.)  I was pointing out if that for Americans, working in landscaping is probably an OK job (better than fast food or other service jobs), but for some one on a visa, especially someone without much education, it's probably one of the better opportunities they'll have. I'd be surprised if the visa laborers didn't take the job more seriously.  It's a good chance for them and losing it would probably cause them more difficulty.  




 That's why I said if you were able to pay 20.  My point is that the quality of American worker you get for 10/11 isn't going to be the top shelf, and  if you compare them to immigrant workers, who are probably some of the more ambitious people in Mexico, American workers are going to come off as lazy.  




 Here's an idea, let me know if it seems to match up with your experience.   For 10/11, you're probably not getting the best people in the American labor pool. But for the visa workers, 10/11 is much better than they'll earn at home.  Hard working people from Mexico want these jobs. If you were able to pay 20 an hour for laborer jobs, I would guess you'd get all the competent hard working Americans you'd need.
Edit: Grammar and clarity 




 I don't think people should be down voting this comment. Asking me to back up what I said is a useful contribution to the discussion.  




 I'd say this headline sums up most of what you need to know about what's wrong with the American economy and justice system. 




 All these fact checking news sites have their flaws, but you don't get these kind of [ratings]( http://www.politifact.com/personalities/scott-walker/) when you're adhering strictly to the truth.
[And this one.] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/02/04/scott-walker-wants-to-drop-search-for-truth-from-the-university-of-wisconsin-mission-heres-why/) A drafting error? 
While this is a [highly partisan site](http://www.alternet.org/story/150170/20_of_the_biggest_lies_told_by_wisconsin_governor_scott_walker), and you may want to discount some of it's claims, most of them are properly sourced.
Not to mention his dishonesty about his intentions. His signature issue, Act 10 to eviscerate public unions, somehow didn't get mentioned during his first campaign during governor.  Or that his intention was to [divide and conquer](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/in-film-walker-talks-of-divide-and-conquer-strategy-with-unions-8o57h6f-151049555.html)  Wisconsin's unions.
 




 They shouldn't. The guy is a lying sack of cheese curds. 




 And expand slavery into the western states.  




 Actually it was more a spend and don't tax situation. The high tax and high service model can work, the low tax and low service model can work, but the high services without taxes to support them fails every time. 




 Not to mention that Wisconsin's income inequality is [growing faster](http://host.madison.com/news/local/writers/mike_ivey/wisconsin-income-gap-widening-faster-than-nation-as-a-whole/article_acc8a776-a0be-11e3-a5f1-001a4bcf887a.html) than the national average.  




 Yet virtually ever Republican in Congress voted for it.  Makes you wonder about their judgement in other matters, doesn't it? 




 Walker would like us to believe that the state's dismal economic performance on his watch is everyone else's fault. He's blamed Jim Doyle, Barack Obama and Mary Burke among others 

I never understand why politicians can get away with this.  They make ludicrous promises (Walker promised his policies would create 250K jobs) and when they fail to deliver, it's everybody's fault but their own.  Arrant puerility, and it's coming from people who are leading the country. 




 Funny how all the right wing pundits who blame the poor for their lack of morals never get around to addressing this sin. 




 It's not just Fox News . Slagging an unpopular groups (i.e. people of African descent, native Americans, immigrants) is an old and unfortunately effective play.  




 Apparently they blame Obama for the gaps in the law's coverage.  Some people just can't be wised up.

He and his wife dont blame the state for not expanding Medicaid, or themselves for waiting until illness struck to sign up for insurance. According to Helms they blame President Obama and Congressional Democrats for passing a complex and flawed bill.  




 But the [money thrown away](http://legis.wisconsin.gov/LAB/reports/15-3highlights.pdf) by Walker's Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation? Fuggedaboutit! 




 Anyone who criticizes America's economic system must be a socialist. Or a communist. Or maybe even a realist.  




 Here's a [link](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/DC-Decoder/2015/0303/Wisconsin-going-right-to-work-What-s-the-impact-for-jobs-and-incomes) for anyone who'd prefer a more balanced discussion of RTW.
