 My friend crashed (pranged) his car and got done (booked) for speeding. 




 I'm certain it was a fixed camera, fixed to bridge/road sign. 




 He's going to tell them they're dreaming. 




 One of those sneaky commas snuck in there like a little bastard. 









 Perfect execution. 




 A bluewafflemachine and a redwafflemachine makes a purplewafflemachine. 




 The red or the blue wire? 









 I've only just joined this sub so excuse my ignorance, but I keep seeing plants in glass 'pots'. I thought terrariums were plants in glass enclosures? 




 Young magpies are normally grey. I've been told that there's a whole family of them nearby. 









 The bike wouldn't need too much to get around. 




 Haha. Like saying "a redditor who needs no introduction, here's Slip_85!". I get it. But I have endless trouble uploading imgur galleries, and by putting the name of the van in the title I thought that should've been enough. Maybe I should have put 'link for the lazy'.

 I found Sinister's [opening scene](http://youtu.be/gf1S81eEqNQ) to be pretty effective. 




 Quan from Regurgitator. 









 Noice. 














 I like to think that if the ball *had* gone out of bounds, that it would make the odds of making this kick even harder. Either way, it's impressive.
 









 Now, we wait.
 




 The night Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind and another his mother called him WILD THING! and Max said  ILL EAT YOU UP! so he was sent to bed without eating anything.

That very night in Maxs room a forest grew and grew and grew until his ceiling hung with vines and the walls became the world all around and an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max and he sailed off through the night and day and in and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are.

And when he came to the place where the wild things are they roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws til Max said BE STILL! and tamed them with the magic trick or staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all and made king of all wild things.

And now, cried Max, let the wild rumpus start!

Now stop! Max said and sent the wild things off to bed without their supper. And Max the king of all wild things was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all.

Then all around from away across the world he smelled good things to eat so he gave up being king of where the wild things are.

But the wild things cried, Oh please dont gowell eat you upwe love you so! And Max said, No!

The wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws but Max stepped into his private boat and waved good-bye and sailed back over a year and in and out of weeks and through the day and into the night of his very own room where he found his supper waiting for him and it was still hot.
 









 Basketball. Haw Haw Haw ^^your ^^^sides. 









 I'm almost certain his initial reaction was to try to help. It was possibly a family member inside the diamond in which he knew was in trouble, so his body reacted before his brain could tell him not to. It was very much a fight or flight scenario, and until something like this (well, not *exactly* like this) occurs, it would be hard to imagine what you would do.
 









 This secret cameo will be revealed in the commentary!
 




 As much as I already love watching them play live, I would love to see a big production make its way to Australia. Oh well, QOTSA are going to more than make up for it I guess.
 




 Not just [once](http://i.imgur.com/CIAOAO2.png). 









 *goosh*
 




 Haha thanks, I don't normally submit from my smartphone. I was so busy making sure it didn't autocorrect to r/orthopedics. 




 Not that it matters, but which part was a lie?
 




 When you have badboys like [these](http://i.imgur.com/EE9vic0.jpg) lying around, you can get caught up in it. Check out the fake debris. 




 This is the most logical and rational comment. I didn't know that the displays were mockups until I saw the styrofoam, and I thought it was mildly interesting. This seemed like the best place to post such a thing.
 




 Well now, does it win? 




 Five dollars. 




 Woah, woah...calm down tiger.
 









 [This](http://i.imgur.com/fYnAhRQ.jpg) is a better view, where the case is visible. 









 If I know anything about skateboarding, it's that for every trick like this, pain comes with the territory. 









 Thanks, Mom.
 




 A reoccurring theme with comments as such, is that they come from users that don't contribute anything themselves. If you can't make it any better, don't try to make it worse. 




 That's an excellent reference, thank you. 




 I find the creepiest things are when things seem almost normal. It's normal but unnatural, which has an unnerving effect.
