 It's actually two parts, neither of which are clickbait or nonsense.

Part one, a link to an article showing a concept of a Nintendo phone. Not my article, nor do I get paid for page views.

Part two, a discussion of what you think about the concept of a Nintendo phone.

That's it. 




 That would be ideal and could get the functionality out to market with low overhead, but you would be missing out on the retro styling and cool factor. 




 I think it works well as a concept, and it might be something that could work in a few years, but you're probably right about the lack of infrastructure support. 




 Probably not, but it's a fun concept to think about. 



















 Thanks! Purply is one of my favorite planes of existence.
