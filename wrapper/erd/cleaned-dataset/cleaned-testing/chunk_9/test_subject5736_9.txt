 Yea that's one of the things I've heard, I'll have to do some research on it 




 Do you have any recommendations for beginner programs? I have been lifting since last september though, but not too seriously until a few months ago when I finished school and started the cut, and have seen some good muscle developments and have been able to increase what I'm lifting despite eating at the deficit. 









 I think this is the main reason for the difference 




 So I have two different packages of plain cashews, yet one has 310 cals per 1/3 cup and the other has 227 cals per 1/3 cup. Why is there a difference? Shouldn't it be the same since it's the same food?
