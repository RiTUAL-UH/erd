 NFL-related people only por favor. 




 Please link to specific photo.  Thanks! 




 I came across this photo... http://i.imgur.com/ZkMNFZz.jpg ...and thought it was remarkably unsettling in a way.  Was curious which other photos come to mind that elicit a similar response or other odd feelings.  (They can be out of context, in context, or whatever.  Stars in other jerseys is weird, but I'm looking for all sorts of strange.)  Thanks!

Edit:  Grammar is fun! 




 Windhorst is a creepy stalker in my opinion.  Here's a candid picture Windhorst took of Lebron and his son during the All-Star break (that Windhorst then posted to his public twitter page).  Lebron should ask for a restraining order.  http://i.imgur.com/HEfegqC.jpg

Edit:  Grammar. 




 I love these parent/child videos and pictures.  Here's a picture of Lebron with his son in Atlanta tonight while they watch the Rockets/Warriors game.  Such a striking resemblance.  http://i.imgur.com/HEfegqC.jpg 




  I believe I can fly.  




 Candid photo of Lebron and his son watching Rockets/Warriors tonight. He looks just like his father. It's remarkable... http://i.imgur.com/HEfegqC.jpg 




 Heaven.  http://i.imgur.com/1nyFEUu.jpg 




 He still doesn't look as old as his father at his age... http://i.imgur.com/HEfegqC.jpg

 Today is a good day to pause and reflect.  Lots of positive/negative emotions last night.  Curious what's swimming through people's minds since there isn't an NBA game on tonight.  Thanks and have fun! 




 Awesome subreddit just needs a few little tinkering-fixes and it will be Finals for Pacers!

Edit:  Other pictures next to posts like the NBA logo, etc are stretched as well.  Maybe it's an easy fix in the code?  I'm not a mod (yet) so I'm not sure what to do.  Thanks! 




 My idea is for a meta film of Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin trying to get Coneheads 2 off the ground.  It explores issues such as crowd-sourcing, product placement (in a different way than how wayne's world did it marvelously), aging stars, new forms of comedy, CG vs props, Aykroyd talking up his Oscar nomination, who really has clout in Hollywood, Lorne Michaels as a gatekeeper, Curtin's built up resentment of Akyroyd for the ignorant slut joke,reboots vs remakes vs one last final hurrah, rights to the characters, etc etc.  It doesn't really start with Dan and Jane wanting to do the movie, it just kind of blossoms over time and they ride the wave, attempting to get off the wave from time to time, etc.  There would be multiple scripts for the Coneheads sequel, and about 3/5th of the way in, it would get even more meta as all of a sudden the projector would screw up (kind of like the muppets movie) and we realize that the Dan/Jane movie is a movie within another movie that we're watching about trying to get a movie about Dan/Jane making Coneheads 2.  And the producers having problems with marketing that film and reshoots, ethics of using unused Farley footage, and what is too ironic/complicated, etc.  I would have story and screenplay credits as well as an executive producer credit.   

Edit: Spelling and whatnot 




 Could be the person who encapsulates the idea of the NFL for you, your favorite player, whoever swims around your head most, etc.  Just the one player that would come to your mind most often/first/etc when you think of the NFL. 




 I'm curious about the anticipation of the championship.  We cannot know exactly what would happen in the eyes of NBA fans if Cleveland wins it all this year, but with him going back to Ohio, the Love situation, etc, etc, I'm curious what you think the aftermath will be. 




 How do you guys honestly think the Deflategate circus will play out?  Not what you hope will happen (and/or your sense of karma).  What will ACTUALLY be the end result of all of the appeals, possible civil suits, press conferences, PR battles, fan outrage, etc, etc.  Looking for the final outcomes related to the league office, teams, players, and their reputations (which obviously will be different from various perspectives).  I personally think this whole thing is beyond dumb, but the drama, emotions have been interesting.  Thanks!

Edit:  Grammar is fun. 









 You can just put them in numerical order like this...

1.  Team - reason why
2.  Other Team - reason why
3.  Another Team - reason why
4.  Last Team - reason why

Or perhaps two of them meet in a Super Bowl for the first time each?  Or one never makes it EVER.  You can mention the year you think they'll make it, etc etc.  It's just whatever your brain predicts.  Have fun and feel free to explain your answers.
