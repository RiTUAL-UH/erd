 How do you like your flight box? Do you have an authentic or a copy?  




 This is SO great.  




 This, dude. Who is taking the picture? Someone outside the car? Does the front of the car have three seats?  




 Hopefully we don't get loose.  




 I am a beautiful beautiful and the other is missing from the world around me and my bud across the country also has a 30w the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the  




 That made literally no sense at all 




 It's not THAT bad. There's no blood at all, and it missed the balls. 




 Swiggity swoogity    
I'm coming for that bulletproof voopity      




 This image has been circulating for over a week. Is it really a friend of yours?

 Vaping wasn't brought into the US until February of 2007, and even then it was only in the form of cigarette look-a-likes.  




 This is the greatest link I've loaded all day. 

I'm surprised it runs so well on mobile.  




 Just curious! I hate all of my rdas. I tried real hard to get a veritas but had no luck, and I've always wanted a marquis.  




 Ahahahah yes! This made my day.  




 Ehh, I figure you only need 1 screw driver to open the case, and then I'll just dry off shit and take off the button. Shouldn't be super hard.  




 I don't think there's anything that can go wrong if you don't have an atomizer on it to complete the circuit. I just take my dripper off when im about to leave it out of sight. I'll be keeping it and trying to take it apart and fix it.  




 You still doing business with cigreen?  




 How do you know?  




 Mine has begun auto firing as well. I believe I got liquid either in the charging port or behind the firing button.  




 Yeah, I couldn't figure out how to spell his username. 

When Obama came on reddit and posted an image of a short thank you letter he wrote to us regarding fighting for net neutrality, this user wrote him a short letter back (wrote out on paper and posted an image) and spelled his own username wrong.  




 Ahhh, so he is another /u/jystdor 




 
 i'm an artist

I'm an artist    
Fake my own death and go platinum

FTFY 




 Did you really spell your name wrong

Or is that part of the joke 




 I

Actually understand it

 I've been using the reddit is fun app for quite some time, and have made the transition over to relay. The app is beautiful looking. The one thing that is really bugging me is that it is impossible to read through a really long thread. While scrolling, if I make the slightest sideways movement with my thumb, it exits the thread and takes me back to the front page. I've had to open this thread over 5 times and try to relocate the place I left off. 

Another issue I'm running into is that YouTube links will not open when the thumbnail is clicked (the internal browser doesn't work), but it will run the video in the YouTube app if I click on the title of the post. 

Overall, the app has a beautiful appearance, but some functionality issues are bugging me a bit.  




 A good thing it remember is that every medication effects every person really differently. The best person to talk to is a doc or a psychiatrist.

I took Welbutrin, and I noticed that while it did help my levels of motivation, that it murdered my appetite and increased my levels of anxiety. Usually with every anti-depressant, you're going to take it for 2 weeks and feel little to nothing (except I felt quite a bit of energy the first 2 days of welbutrin), and then around that 2 week mark is when you start feeling the changes your medication will bring. 

I can tell you that I took effexor for quite a long time, and while starting it (especially while leveling up doses), I couldn't even form sentences. My brain was just adjusting hardcore and I was totally just lost in a fog for a couple days. It went away quickly, though.

If what you're feeling persists for too long (a week, or less if you're real uncomfortable), talk to who prescribed it to ya. 




 Feeling down tonight. Figured I'd share a beautiful song.

Here's [Thank You - by Royksopp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLLbFDRG2zc)

is so easy

So, thank you

Knowing    
you'll never walk away    
like I did,    
you know...

Thank you,

Noone    
can see inside of me    
like you do...

Thank you,    
for the hours    
in the orange sky.

Brother,    
you will always be    
a part of me...

And thank you    
for the courage,    
when I go too far...

Knowing    
you'll never walk away,

You know...

 You're gonna make it. You're one of the very few people I see that knows they're depressed and **wants** to get help. That's really great to see.

If you feel that a stay in the hospital would be fitting for you, I'd advise to not shy away from it. While it was a hard experience, it gives a person the tools they need to really begin to start changing their life.

If you want to look into therapy, try out this awesome resource: https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/

Put in your zip, instantly get a lot of therapists around you - and you can sort by price per session (it shows what insurances they accept). I've personally gone with a therapist off there who offered $35 per session over the table, and it's one of the best choices I ever made.

That website allows you to send emails directly to each therapist, and in emailing 4 that I saw, I found that they all reply really quickly.

Just introduce yourself, and ask what their availability is like :) 




 That's not cool, man. 




 Hey there.

I feel you - I get what you're feeling. I just wanted to pop in and say that I'm feeling the same, even today. I'm a type of person that is always looking for music to comfort me in every situation, and for this situation I've got [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ7hdF7Xyns), actually called "Why Won't They Talk To Me." If you're interested in music at all, have a listen. If you like it, that whole album (Called Lonerism) really reflects that same feeling of people around you just isolating you. A few tracks are sort of like - hey fuck them, I'm better off by myself anyways (Track: Solitude is Bliss.)

Best of luck, friend. I'm trying my best to start meeting new people, because while I feel that I'm always there for everyone around me - when it comes to me being down, no one is ever really there. It's a shitty feeling to have. 




 You're all doing it wrong.

Use [Nuttit](http://www.nuttit.com). 




 True that, my friend! 




 Thank you for knowing this. NJOY, known as Sottera at the time, was the first company to bring the electronic cigarette to the United States. They do have beginner setups and actual vials of Eliquid with fruity flavors. Never tried it, but I support them. I got one of their cigalikes and it of course tasted real bad, but it's the only cigalike I'll use if my setup breaks down.  




 Wat 




 Dave Grohl is the greatest man who ever lived!  




 Favorite of mine, too. First song I ever played live.  




 Bummer, man. I've got a fix for you if you're at all still interested. I can dig it up tomorrow. There's a patch that you flash before flashing Hyperdrive to fix the WiFi issue.  




 Did you fix the issue? 




 This has actually happened 




 This is garbage... They tested a DIY version of the product that they made, and admitted that, in the commercial version, not only might they use a higher proof alcohol, but it might be absorbed by a completely different substance - a type of sugar instead of powder. I don't understand what this is besides good comedy.  




 No 




 JOOR ZAH FRUL 




 Reynolds, eh? Shall we further this conspiracy and ask if this Reynolds is related to the CEO of Reynolds American -  the big tobacco company? That would make this even more interesting.  




 I need to see this again. Have a link to the video by chance?  




 Ahhh yes. Thank you.  




 The only issue I has with that was returning moments of mindfuck anxiety 2 days after each smoke session. Killer amounts of THC in that strain. Smells fucking strong and amazing.  




 Seems to be the most efficient way 




 Did you really photoshop this just for this occasion? This is great, man. Deserves more than 8 upvotes for sure.  




 Died.  




 Ahahahahah 

What is this from again?  




 You probably just made my entire night. I'm gonna go get stoned and watch off the air for the rest of the night. Remind me later and I'll report back for an AMA.  




 This would be a really good /r/brokengifs 




 I've seen Outlaw 1%ers wearing swastika patches. Came here looking for a similar answer.  




 "Loud pipes save lives." 




 Can you link to the context, please?  




 I don't know if you seen it, but the Outlaw's female shirts say "**Property** of Outlaws MC" - I'm pretty sure it's across the tits as well.  




 I've spent some time around Outlaws. 

Are you the racist,  anti-semitic type of Outlaw?  




 I've also had two bottles of skittles flavors from two different companies than the one stated both turning out tasting like rubbing alcohol.  




 To add onto this, I believe you're having dry hits because of the massive amount of wick. Generally, in addition to having it pulled through the coil, you'll want as little cotton as possible. Because you've got quite a bit of wick, the liquid in the wick is all sitting elsewhere and not able to move very fast to the spot you're heating with the coil. 

My general rule of thumb when wicking is to put enough wick through the coil so it's not thin enough to slide through the coil on its own (without you pulling it), but it's not ever getting stuck in or choked by the coil (not difficult to pull through at all). 

Also, is your coil getting red hot while it's wicked? That shouldn't ever happen. Something is up there, too.  




 Tobacco Company Lobbyists.  




 Nitecore-i2-Intellicharger is outdated. I'd recommend you don't recommend them anymore. Check out the Nitecore-D2-Intellicharger.  




 We have to remember that we are dealing with a group of people who once rationalized smoking (myself included), an action that kills 443,000 in the US every year.  




 Hey! Nice username, I've got a Turbo GTI as well. 

Do you access through a reddit app? Most have access to the sidebar. I use redditisfun, and it's got it.  




 This is in the sidebar FAQ 




 Excellent collection. Thank you!

 That is not Kanthal. Kanthal will never melt. It can withstand 2600F

Buy Kanthal from the creators of Kanthal.

 I've got a CLT. Also, if the positive post ever raises, just tap it down hard with the butt of a screwdriver. Otherwise, to spin my post I just use a tweezers.  




 Knoxville has giant billboards advertising their vape shops! 




 Yeah. Thicker vg liquid takes a higher wattage to vaporize.  




 Clarification. You don't know whether it's bad or not because you haven't done any studying. Swallowing propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, and flavoring concentrates is completely fine.  




 You could drink nicotine free Eliquid, and it'd be just like drinking a soda with really concentrated flavor - or more accurately, drinking Mio.  




 Take it to /r/shitty_ecr 




 I'm actually not. I just didn't understand why it was relevant.  




 OH shit, I get it now! Ahahah 




 After a little digging.

 When you're complaining about a business, don't fight to convince people to never buy from them again. The "beware" sharade is just ridiculous. This thread would have went over much better if you stated what problems you had, provided proof, and let people make their own decision.  




 Wtf

Lol 




 Holy shit.  




 Looks like I had sex with this whole thread. Interesting.  




 I share every pain you describe there, except I luckily haven't had to hold a girls hand while driving since I've lost my automatic. It's not super hard for me if driving auto, and I'd imagine it could work in a manual on the freeway.  




 These guys have to be on nitrous or some shit. Just watched a Lil under 10 episodes, there's no way they aren't on something.  




 I think he could probably arrange this.  




 That made me uncomfortable just watching it. I go crazy if anyone is even slightly preventing me from making a smooth shift.  




 True, true.  




 Oh. Those are two things I like! I dislike the icons, but I have a bunch of background processes always running. I love green as well, [it actually matches my keyboard] ( http://imgur.com/KjXL9xC)  




 Ahahah, ugly eh? What part about it is ugly? I'd love to see what I could do to make it better. 

 I believe it is part of the Hyperdrive tweaks for the Hyperdrive ROM 




 This comment chain is the funniest shit I've ever read on reddit.  




 Can confirm 

Have done same

Sometimes their useful for shenanigans. Claiming parking spots at school, blocking things off, etc.  




 I second this notion, Drew.  




 It's funny, because according to the body diagram, an excellent place to measure your iron count is on your genitals. 

It looks as if our e-stick here is multipurposed. 




 I fucking love Japan. I don't understand people that don't understand me when I say it's the weirdest fucking country ever.

Concerning the syntax of the English language.

 I spit out blood after brushing my teeth every morning...

What exactly is the problem that gum disease causes? 




 This just happened to a Milwaukee Brewer about a week ago.  




 This kid is going to grow up one day, look back on this, and realize that this was the peak of his fame - the day he became a meme, but was too young to be able to do anything about it.  




 This is the reason that this thread doesn't get an upvote from me. Why share this while not spreading information that could possibly help people avoid it.  




 This is what I've been doing since I've started. Every new device/new charger gets at least 3 charges in the bag while I'm home and awake.  




 Thank you for doing this. Hysteria is the key word, and I appreciate that you're trying to prevent it.  




 Oh, so if fluid flows freely out of the end of the brake line, it's fine? Because my whole brake fluid reservoir emptied out this brake line :/. It's not possible that fluid goes out but not back in?  




 This is about to get really meta,
