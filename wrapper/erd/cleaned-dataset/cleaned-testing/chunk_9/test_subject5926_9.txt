 "WAZZZZUUUUPPP?!" 




 Ohh that looks amazing ! 




 I will go with thrusting, but some kind of knotting would also be pretty good, thats why I was thinking about going for Chance since I like the head shape.   Its kinda hard to say which one i prefer since i love both of these feelings. 




 Hey man and thanks for answer,  
Yeah I really enjoy the "filling" feeling, but I thought something with some kind of knot would be nice.   I know that plug is pretty small and I have no problem to go like 2 or more times deeper.   I was thinking about going for the Chance since I like the knot at the head of it, or shape of it (not sure how to call it), but lately I was considering something with big knot.  I would like to get something that would challenge me, but wouldnt be crazy overkill.  
About the firmness, I wasnt really thinking about it, but I think that Firm would be the go-to.  
Yeah Im ordering to Czech Republic so Im prepared to pay some extra, but I can deal with that. 




 Hello guys Im 18 years old guy who found out about Bad Dragon recently and i must say i totaly love this ! I love the people around here and all the stuff that bad dragon produces, I m just student so my money balance is pretty bad but I decided to get myself something to play with.  
So here s the thing.   
I m not sure what to go with, I already have (not bad dragon) [this](http://www.lovehoney.co.uk/product.cfm?p=6406) home and I can get myself open pretty good i think.  (probably not enough for large Chance, but thats pretty hardcore :))  
So the thing is can you guys gimme some recommendations for what toy would be good for me ? If you wanna know something feel free to ask, I can also provide with photos if it will be of any help :) , or you might enjoy it :) .   
Thanks for reading such a long post and I m sorry if I made any English mistakes :)  




 I know that feeling bro, I just got into Hunnie Pop and i just cant stop ! 




 "what color is this ? "
