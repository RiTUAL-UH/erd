 What on earth does knowing about what to look for in a cast-iron pan have to do with misogyny? 




 I'm a girl! 




 You're only partially right here... after 1900, the content in manufacturing cast iron cookware changed, and it continued to get worse and worse each decade.  Even a low quality pan, *properly seasoned* will stand up to a ton of use and abuse... that said, I'm not surprised that it was the handle that broke off... a lot of people think you only need to season the portion that is used for heating and cooking, so it's common to not be as vigilant about caring for your handle.  If you're into Griswold, the thing to look for is an italicized name in combination with a fire-ring... that is the best damn pan you can buy!  :) 




 Great!  Although, I want to tell you that you might want to go Linen in the summer and Bamboo in the winter, the bamboo tend to hold moisture, so if you're like most men and sweat a bit throughout the night, things might get damp. :) 




 If you like Egyptian Cotton, you should think about getting Linen or Bamboo based sheets.  Contrary to popular belief, a super high thread-count isn't desirable if you're not buying a high-end sheet... It will pill.  Get yourself something in the range of 300 - 400 and wash them a few times, it'll be just as soft, but more durable.  I'll let someone else address mattress pads.

 Where do you think the propensity for straw men on reddit comes from?  

A great example that comes to mind was the infamous Father's Day post in /r/askreddit about why men had abandoned their families... not a single post in there talked about fatherhood, merely about the devil women who they were doomed to pay out the ass due to an unfair custody battle... How many men could the casual redditor actually know in real life who were fucked by an UNFAIRLY biased court system to believe it is a serious issue and worth bringing up every two goddamn seconds?  I can't help but think we wouldn't have guardian ad litems if it were as cut and dry as reddit makes it out to be.   




 The knowledge that Anthony Hopkins had a short-lived career in the 1980's as a pop star.  Here is his one and only single: [1986's *Distant Star*.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cz_mNW6S_w)  You're welcome.  




 Really, Grumbler?  What kind of shoes do you spend your premium budget on?  Now I've just got to know...  




 Your dad is trying it now... you seriously made my night.  You have a great time, man! :) 




 If you say "orange" really slowly, it sounds like "gullible."

Just get yourself a shot glass and six beers and do a Power Hour.  




 Communicate effectively.  




 What has stopped you from adopting a reasonable hand washing regimen?  




 Yessss... I love my Griswold collection.  My babies!  




 Pretty much any toaster... buying a new toaster is pretty much like finding a spouse... it's going to be heartbreak after heartbreak until it isn't... 




 I definitely appreciate that you're trying to help me, but he is an introverted person who would never consider therapy.  He has had relationships prior to me, some for simply sexual means.  He is 11 years older than me, and a seven times daily marijuana user.  This is what I chalk it up to.  No amount of communication on the issue has helped me.  I talk, he responds in monosyllables and then goes away. It kind of is what it is.  He's a smart, kind person who is a wonderful father and lets me be myself in almost every other regard.  I think this is probably as good as I can reasonably expect.  You can't win them all.   




 A-fucking-men, man.  That shit kills your soul.  I've been with my husband for just about five years now.  He wants to have sex maybe an average of once per month.  If I could pick my perfect scenario it would be 3x a day, a day off, repeat.  So it's pretty exciting when it finally comes around... but when he just rushes through everything and doesn't even kiss me, I feel like I'm dying inside.  You shouldn't do that shit to the person you're supposed to love more than anything.  




 What has your wife done exactly that causes you to believe that she is an unfit parent and thus doesn't deserve custody of your child? 




 Well, I have to say that it's like pretty much every other huge life-changing event... people say cliches about it, so you imagine it'll be a certain way, but then it happens and it's nothing like what you'd thought it would be.  I don't think about my 8 month old daughter throughout the work day very often, but when I do, I'm hit with a heartbreak feeling and I miss her so much in that moment that I could start crying... it's very strange, because you only really feel those overwhelming feelings when you stop to think about them.   




 You mentioned that you're an English teacher... what is some required reading you would like to ditch from your school curriculum and what would you like to sub in?  




 The best revenge is living well.  This is none of your business, stay out of it.  




 I subscribed... your hustle is real... good for you! :) 




 Hard drugs.  Out of the bedroom physical violence.  




 Here's a great one for you: I have dyscalculia... I am beyond terrible at math and numbers... instead of burning myself out trying, I devised a guessing method.  Using the assumption that they will always try to get you on a rounding or order of operations technicality, I narrowed from four to two answers by spotting the two that were closest together.  Then I just guessed between the two.  Using this method, I scored a 16.  This was score was higher than average the year I did it (2007).

Edit: Sorry, I took the ACT... scoring is different.  Still... I'd assume it would be very similar since the tests are largely interchangeable to colleges.  




 It's absolutely more difficult to etch on a woodblock BUT you really should check your course descriptions... almost all beginning printmaking classes deal exclusively in linoleum prints (which are SO MUCH fun....). 




 I'm sitting on 11 crebbits right now, but I bought them prior to the Chooting... how do you know these persons aren't the same and just spending them in a way to illicit a reaction?  




 Well, in my mind it is less of a stretch of your technical cognizant skills as an artist... in intaglio, you're taking away an area that will then look like a highlight... in relief printmaking, you're taking away an area that won't read as a highlight until you ink and pull a print... it's much more intellectually stimulating.  There is also the enjoyment of the deferred image... there is just something magical about putting all of your work into one object, and then pulling something startlingly different from all that work... it's amazing!   




 I love relief printmaking... it's wonderful if you like a process and are a perfectionist. :) 




 Well, why do you think that?  I don't actually think we do, I just think those "one-hits" haven't stood the test of time... I remember my mom asking who played the song that was on the radio, and I said to her "Buffalo Springfield," and she literally accused me of making up a band that had Neil Young in it.  One hit wonder... Warren Zevon? One hit wonder... Norman Greenbaum?  One hit wonder.... Pure Prairie League?  One hit wonder... I'm sure there are countless others that just didn't stand the test of radio play time...  




 I would switch to an extra soft bristle rating and keep doing what you're doing.  The other poster is mistaken... you cannot brush your enamel away, if you could, they'd damage your teeth by de-scaling them in the dentist's office... you can, however, brush your gums into trauma if you use too firm of a brush in combination with a strong stroke.  




 /r/benfranklinfanclub 




 Duck abuse.  




 I would let it die out with me.  The infant mortality and mother mortality rates have gone down significantly due to medical intervention... suppose you take that risk of impregnating your partner and then run into complications?  Is it worth the risk?  Even if everyone gets out alive, how long will that baby live?  It's a risky business if you ask me..  




 Yeah, I got that, but you can tell by my answer that I don't think what happened the last two days is relevant.  I do it to make the day of a random user... I don't see my paltry $30 every five months as a significant profit for reddit and I don't actually have an opinion on Pao's alleged reign of terror.  




 Telling the kid "Don't cry..." 

Hello, male suicide rate.  




 Ross is also my favorite character... probably since the only thing he ever said that resonated with me ran deep.. I am ALL ABOUT making sandwiches out of Thanksgiving leftovers.... a "moistmaker" sounds like a pretty good idea to me. 




 People who have never gotten it before get really excited about it... I like to give it out to people who make me laugh or renew my faith in humanity. 




 I can't stand Friends... it's just not at all funny to me.  I thought maybe I was too young to get it, but upon it coming to Netflix a few years back, I found out, no... It's just not funny to me at any age.  I think it's because I don't find a single character on the show to be relatable.  They're all very one-dimensional.  




 I don't know that it's an even split, because it assumes that we're all working.  There are plenty of potential voters who are disabled or retired or simply unemployed.  I'm trying to think of a good incentive, but I think the only thing I think would work would be the opposite... a fine.  In Argentina, it is illegal to be of voting age and to not vote.  The penalty is a fine.  We all care about money, I think this would be the only thing that would resonate at every level.  I wish I had a more positive answer for you.  




 [Here, I got you this.](https://menssuitsleo.wordpress.com/2014/12/19/8-style-tips-for-short-men/) The model (you) is everything... yeah, on a damn table, it might look geriatric, but I doubt you're going to scroll through this and think "Man, paging Mr. Rogers..." unless you're determined to do so.  I don't find any of these men boring to look at.  




 Okay, those are some interesting thoughts... but we're looking at a very real difference in ideology insofar as taxes... typically your lower-income liberals are not going to be enticed by a tax break since they over pay to get a big refund... a tax break is really only going to appeal to conservatives who are already going to the polls anyway...  I don't think you're right in your thought that the money saved would be funneled back to the working class through their employers, that's pretty idealistic.  I think offering a tax break is very akin to Voter IDs... it would just be another subversive way to ensure that only conservatives find voting attractive.  




 Okay, let me try to help you... I think you should look into getting yourself some corduroy pants (it was like pulling teeth to get my husband to buy a pair for our wedding, but then he wore his to death for four years and I had to throw them out in the night because of holes.... most comfortable pants he ever owned), a sweater collection (lots of variety here homes, you can be Nero from Sons in a Cardigan, rock a sweater vest like a cute little hipster, or go classicly preppy in a nice pullover).  I think you should hop on over to Uniqlo.com for styling inspiration... it doesn't have to be boring.  I wouldn't be caught dead in slacks and a polo either.  




 If he thinks guys pants suck, he should try putting on a pair of professional women's pants... you can't breathe, they cut in, and the pockets are merely decorative.  I weigh 104 lbs... These pants are the right size... hips and high-waisted pants cannot co-exist.  




 How would a 1% tax break even in theory save money?  I'm very confused... 

Edit: OP don't down vote me because I asked you for clarification on your question....

 *TL;DR: Fuck me against a wall with your hand around my neck to make me orgasm. 




 I like it when a guy isn't self-conscious, asks for what he wants, takes control.  It's a turn off if he talks himself up, I'll believe you and inevitably be disappointed when you don't live up to your own hype.  Girls are not all the same, you might've been the best oral sex your ex ever had, but that doesn't mean you're the best I've ever had.  You'll know you did it right if I walk into the wall on the way to the bathroom.  




 Cautionary tale : If he's 11 years older than you, he's too old for your youthful bullshit.  Ahahaha! :-| 




 I flirt with my husband probably about eight times a day.. he pretty much just ignores me.  Occasionally he'll call me crass.   




 You need to check your ends for breakage.  Color damages your hair and broken hair doesn't appear to grow.  Changes in diet can also contribute.  I'm guessing it's just time for a trim.  




 I think we established this when I said I had a 31 inch inseam and no torso ;)

Also that I have a thigh gap and C-cups... Believe it or not, I have almost no fat on my face... what you're seeing is cheekbones.  It's very weird.  




 Ahahaha.  Well, I'm not.  But I appreciate the sentiment.  I'm at a BMI of 22.... which is in the high-mid range for my height.   




 Ah well... I was really thrilled when "thigh-gap" became a thing... I've had one my whole life and thought it was some sort of knee deformity... FINALLY, a genetic jackpot!  Wee! 

My sister had breast reduction surgery... the doctor wouldn't take her below a B-Cup saying he needed to ensure an "aesthetic result."  If I have to have drains put in and go through what she went through, I'm not getting less than what I want, which would be flat as a board.  Watch me get diagnosed with breast cancer now.  




 I'm only a C cup, but I would have them cut off if I could just because they get in the way.  I'd like to be, uh, willowy.  But it's just not in the cards genetically.  I figure my daughter will be about 5'3" though... I'd be shocked if she wasn't.  




 Okay, we're moving out and into a place with central air.  Then we'll make ice cubes on the countertops and we'll never be sad or too warm again.  




 Yeah, the pregnancy definitely made me uncomfortable... I had trouble breathing from the time I was four months!  Curse my short, short spine! 




 I'm moving in.  




 How dare you... I might be under 5' but I also have a 31 inch inseam.... I'm basically nothing BUT legs, sir.  (I can't wear a belt without looking deformed, but hey, belts are stupid... they just pull your pants DOWN if you're a girl...) 




 You know I'd miss you, and I'd notice you were gone in about 48 hours. ;) Please don't ever go on vacation.  




 I can tell you from one stolen glance at an ex who was scarfing down a pizza that it can actually do irreparable damaged.  The immediate image when I hear his name are those bulging eyes.  Be very careful. (I haven't peeked since.) 




 Right? The fact that we eat as a social activity is really mind-blowing when you think about it... it's pretty much the most unattractive thing ever.   




 Only if he's Peter Dinklage... although, I think he might actually be taller than me.... Um... really, anything over 5'2" is fine. It's not important.  I just so happen to be 4'11.5". 




 I have a baby who is drinking formula.  The US Government has straight up said that they approved an over-floridization of water.  My books tell me I'm supposed to give my baby unflorinated well-water or risk her teeth coming in streaked white... that's pretty fucked up...  




 It costs me $33/month with Culligan... install was about $70.  They change the five filters every six months. 




 I know you had a run-in with her the other day, but I actually think you should take a look at her comment history and listen to that Warren Zevon song "Reconsider Me."  




 /u/hugsouffle That Aussie is hilarious and warm.  She's also nice to other women.  We could use more just like her.  




 I don't care for baseball, I feel like it has a lot to do with numbers.  I do, however, love le cheeseburger.  




 The question was "What do you do that gets a lot of unjustified hate?"

I gilded this : "Listen to Eminem and jailbreak my phone."

I thought this was HILARIOUS.  




 Yes... that's why I rent a reverse osmosis filtration system for my drinking water...  




 Taking their insecurities out on other girls.  We should be raising each other up.  




 I have two dream jobs:

Lead singer in a Warren Zevon cover band... this is never hiring because not enough people listened to Warren Zevon to make a cover band appropriate.

Person who names paint colors.... this isn't a real job in and of itself. 

The dream is over. :( 




 CRAWL Magazine... they have awesome customer service.  They're an off-road mudding quarterly publication that will totally send you free stuff if asked. :) 




 I swear I'm not being snide or difficult, I'm asking as the parent of an 8 month old... how can you have a child and no expectations from your partner? Teach me your secrets!  




 No joke, I would probably date you in a hot minute.  There is nothing wrong with being one in 120,000.  You're amazing!  




 The secret is to actually not need anyone outside of yourself.  If you know that there are five more people who would kill to be with you, you'll project this and it makes it impossible for guys to then take you for granted.

I moved in with my husband after we'd been dating for two weeks.  We got married at 1.5 years.  We've been married for almost four years, we own a house, two rescue dogs, and we had a baby last year.  









 I identify as a feminist and I love reddit.  I'm not a crazy sjw, and I'm actually more passionate about educating people on race issues.  However, it seems because I choose to not let a few crazies scare me off from the word, I'm presumed to be one of those crazies.  









 [Prepackaged "Baby Carrots" are, in fact, full sized carrots that have been whittled down.](http://www.healthfitnessrevolution.com/baby-carrots-less-nutritious-lie/) 




 Do you mean socialize them with other animals, or do you mean with people? 




 That was the subtle humor.... ;) 




 "Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue" by Toby Keith needs to be on your list.   




 Didn't he try to steal "Keep on Rockin' in the Free World?" 

Born in the USA was some guy in the 80's.....  




 This is mega appropriate: From watching George of the Jungle, which I was just pointing out as a must-miss comedy.  Ahahaha!  




 George of the Jungle starring Brendan Frasier comes to mind...  




 There was this god-awful news story about a child pornographer who was arrested in my city... because it's not a huge city, you couldn't really get away from the coverage, it was a really big news item... He lived with a girlfriend who had a 5 month old baby girl.  The baby girl was featured in the footage he was selling over the web at the fire department he volunteered for.  My mom told me about it and having a two week old baby, I lost it.  I was inconsolable for about two hours.  




 That I meant what I typed or that the average ages were that in 2004 or that girls are waiting longer or what man?  Because one of them, I can't prove technically, since I'm the source, but the other two, I can dig up for you if you're that passionate. 

Thanks for the edit, here's mine: http://www.nbcnews.com/id/37853719/ns/health-sexual_health/t/surprising-sex-statistics/ 




 I'm not sure why both these other posters think I made a typo here.  I meant what I typed, although my statistic was outdated... In 2004, this was the case.  These days apparently girls are waiting longer than boys on average in the US.  




 I was 16.  He was 18.  This is the statistic median in both cases.  




 This should probably be posted at /r/morbidquestions ... those guys know their stuff.  




 Absolutely!   




 Dude.... this leads to NECROSIS of the penis... If this is actually happening to him, get the fuck off reddit and go to the ER NOW. 




 That's so irresponsible of Instagram! :(

I'm sorry this is happening to you.   




 I really enjoyed Rango... it was so offbeat and clever.   




 Sounds like your imposter is Catfishing people.  You get a following if you cyber with people on the internet.  Can you report them?  That's so not cool...  




 I used to work at a Gamestop.  I was going to go out into the mall to get a soda on my break... on my way out this guy came into the store and said "Oh! Are you leaving?" And I said, no I'm just going on my break, but if there is something I can help you with, I can do that first.... He said "Oh no... I just came to see you."  And then he left.

Two weeks later my co-worker noticed that this same guy was following her car from the mall parking lot in his car.  She had to drive to the police department.  




 I can't take it if a man doesn't wear a t-shirt or undershirt under his dress shirt... like I ever want to be looking at your nipples or your chest hair in a business setting... this is way unprofessional.  




 Nevermind... this is the only answer.  




 I think initially, it feels exactly the same... it's a difference you grow into.  My mother described it, quite pithily, as being like a birthday.  I feel different now, but you know, it's been nearly four years and we have a child together now.  




 How about slow building up to fast?  I think that's the only answer.
