 Look into *A Piece of Cake* by Cupcake Brown.  




 Lately I've been biting off more than I can chew with the books I've been reading. I've been reading some dry nonfiction or very dense classics and haven't been getting much joy from it. 


I need an easy read that will remind me again why I love reading. I'm hesitant to say what books I like because I don't want you to overthink your recommendation. I'm just looking for something easy, not horribly long and a page-turner.  




 I think the opposing team gets to pick who shoots.  




 It's almost like the award is based on an 82 game season and not the most recent 6 quarters.  




 7 point game at the half and everyone is ready to give the Cavs the ring right now. Calm down, people.  




 ??? Both games have gone into overtime. What else do you want?  




 He's that fucking good.  




 Well, we play the Padres a lot.  




 Heston must have thought there was only one out.  




 Only 74 pitches too.  




 More like Clark's desert boots.  




 LeBron wearing white socks with black shoes. /r/malefashionadvice would flip if they saw.  




 Pitch count after two: 52/14 




 How is Philly's bullpen? I have a feeling we're going to get to it early today.  




 What a day for sports. Giants baseball, Champions League final, and a potential triple crown winner.  




 I hate being sad when Dodgers fans are happy.  




 Don't push it too much. Getting punched by a fist full of rings hurts.  




 Their GDT are lucky if they break 100 comments.  




 Boneshaker's in Rocklin has good tacos and beer. If you want to go to Sacramento, try Azul on 20th.  




 Remember when Chris Stewart was an easy out?  




 Caitlyn Jenner looking good in The Solar Company commercial.  




 That was strike 3 to Pagan earlier.  




 At this point, I don't think his ceiling is very high.  




 Confirmed. Would plunder booty.  




 No one told Belt that it's not May anymore.  




 Who do I talk to about ordering sexual donuts?  




 I'm glad to see this comment. I actually bought the shoes this afternoon in anticipation of pants that I ordered last week finally arriving. So, I know the pants are the weak spot in this outfit, but by the end of the week they should be the strong point.

 Why do I have no memory of Chad Santos? 


Edit: It's bcauase he had [4 days of big league experience]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Santos) 




 Barve mode activated 




 The error on Simmons has officially been changed to an E3.  




 His ties are incredible. If the two I ordered are as good looking irl as they are in the picture, I'm probably going to order a few more, starting with [this one]( https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0402/4577/products/AboagyeTies-8.jpg?v=1412046396). I just need find an excuse to wear more ties.  




 No. He had an O'fer against the Brewers.  




 Dodgers lose!  




 The first time I saw it I was waiting for a punch line that never came.  




 Brandon-er  




 Is Teheran's velocity usually this low? I haven't seen him break 90.  




 Brandon of the inning: Tie  




 If at first you don't succeed... 




 There's a lot of big league experience on the River Cats' roster. I should go to more games.  




 I thought it was a no doubter too.  




 Just ordered two Aboagye ties. [This beauty]( https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0402/4577/products/Aboagye_Tie_Clips_5-12-16_b6eb1cbb-4628-4c13-94a7-399afcebf7a4.jpg?v=1431579558) as well as [this one]( https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0402/4577/products/IMG_1844_copy.jpg?v=1405656294). Can't wait to wear them out.  




 What is the general rule for pairing ties with outfits? I've been shopping for ties lately and I struggle to visualize them with the shirts I own.  




 What would you wear [this tie]( https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0402/4577/products/IMG_1844_copy.jpg?v=1405656294) with? I just bought it because I thought it was awesome, but I'm not sure what it would go with. Ideally, I would pair it with a shirt sans jacket.  




 Read a magazine. Lately I've been trying to buy magazines on subjects that I know very little about in an effort to expand my horizons a bit. If you enjoy it, great. You might even discover a new hobby. If not, you only wasted a few dollars and the time it takes to read a magazine.  




 Grunting guy needs to stop. This is a family show.  




 It was scored a hit, but it would have been an error for any other short stop.  




 [Who Timmy reminds me of when he wears the flat brim hat and do rag]( http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kyvtmfqPia1qzkotso1_500.png) 




 I was being sarcastic. Will seems like a great guy :-) 




 Dude just wrote on your ball?! The nerve... 




 When you finish cooking the steak, put some mushrooms and onions in the pan with some wine and cook those for a few minutes.  




 The Dodgers are getting rained on right now. I swear to God I'll die if they get out of facing Michael Wacha this series. 




 In bed with an ear infection. I need these antibiotics to kick in asap so I can watch the game.  




 How tall is Amy G? She's eye to eye with Belt. Is she standing on something?  




 Nay  




 You'll notice the same guy in red pants on the arcade and the same boat out in the Cove. Every time.  




 Has anyone else noticed that when the CSN graphic comes out of McCovey Cove it's recycled footage and not live?  




 TJ surgery in 2012. He was never the same.  




 Who is the guy talking to Heston in the dugout?  




 What was the question?  




 On the current roster, only Belt, Crawford, Aoki, Panik and Blanco bat lefty/switch. Of those guys, Belt and Crawford have the most power. My bet is Brandon Belt gets #69 this series. Hopefully I'll be right where I am now: sitting on my couch. 


Edit: Well, it's not #69, but I'll take a opposite field HR to break the 0-0 tie.  




 I've been using the terms interchangeably, but there's a big difference between [this](http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m32homu6aA1r3s2t7o1_r1_1280.jpg) and [this](http://imgur.com/BqPOWow).  




 It's always winter in San Francisco.  




 It's okay, guys. We can stop booing him now.  




 *"Hnnngggg, I need that"* 




 He could be useful to another team. He is a stud defensively at first base and he knows how to work a good AB.  




 Can someone explain to me why those Rockets fans had chef gear on?  




 I'm no doctor, but it doesn't seem like an injury that can be aggravated by playing. Worst case scenario is he's just ineffective.  




 You think a hold is equal to cocking back and elbowing a guy in the face?  




 If only the Browns could return to the glory days of Tim Couch.  




 My opinion is that he would look great in orange and black. 




 As frustrating as it was to watch him this year, he always had a good attitude and by all accounts was a good clubhouse guy. I truly wish him the best. He wasn't getting it done on the field, but I'll still root for him to turn it around.  




 Unfortunately for him, there's not really a spot for him on the team. His defense isn't good enough to be a big league third baseman and we don't have a use for another first baseman, at least not as much as we could use another bullpen arm. It sucks because he's raking this year.  




 So we still don't know what this means for McGehee? He could go to Sacramento or opt to be released?  




 What exactly does it mean to be DFA? I've been a baseball fan for 15 years and I still don't know. Sometimes it seems like it's basically equal to being released, other times it seems like it's just a send down.  




 It's the exact opposite of what we're used to in SF, so it's stressful to watch a game played there. I've heard it's one of the nicer parks though.  




 Woohoo! Baseball!  




 There's no way we get two games in today in this weather. I guess it will be the W's and UFC 187 to get my sports fix in today.  




 Sounds like a dick to me.  




 [You mad, bro?]( https://scontent-ams.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/e15/10919309_1549683575314754_1318468887_n.jpg) 




 /r/dodgers absolutely hates their own team. They're so bitter.  




 It's a nickname and it's pronounced KEY KEY. Still offensive to the Jews though.  




 I'll take "Phrases in my browser history" for $500, Alex.  




 He literally didn't get a hit this season until Saturday. Scrub.  




 The salt in the /r/Dodgers gdt is so tasty.  




 *Juan Uribe is a Rembrandt* 




 Yes. I posted the same picture a few months ago with a story of how he was stealing my gains.  




 Keep your back straight and your core tight. It's what he would have wanted.  




 [Here's the recipe for my grandma's Mac and cheese](http://www.reddit.com/r/gainitmeals/comments/2ln927/just_recreated_my_grandmas_macaroni_and_cheese/). I think it's great.  




 I don't need to tell any of you how important having a good lifting partner is and I was fortunate to have a great one for 11 years. Unfortunately, his health began declining rapidly in the last week. This morning, he entered Swolehalla. I'll continue to lift without him, but I like to think he'll be spotting me in spirit. 


Here's a picture I took of him right before he set a PR.

 Anyone know if that GMC commercial with Jeremy Affeldt where they talk about pitchers who paint the corners being called Rembrandts is played around the entire country or just Nor Cal?  




 Like this one a lot!  




 I like this a lot. Looks stylish without trying too hard.

-The pants/shoes are both from a local store. I'm waiting on 2 other pairs of pants (khaki/olive) to come in the mail.

Trying to dress a bit nicer for work. I'm waiting on a pair of khaki chinos and another pair of olive chinos. In the meantime, I have these off white things. How does this outfit look?  




 http://imgur.com/a/Fr61u


I bought this shirt to pair with khaki chinos to wear to work, but does it work with jeans? Could I wear this successfully to a bar?  




 http://imgur.com/a/HHLIp


I'm really just looking for an opinion on these boots. Can they be worn with jeans and a button up shirt if I'm just going out to a bar with friends? Any other suggestions for making them work? I bought these a long time ago, but I'm not a big fan of black boots. I hate letting them just sit in my closet though.  




 As someone who has never followed Bellator before, where can I watch the prelims?  




 This isn't true. I received my degree in social sciences last year and in none if my classes was it so much as hinted at that non-whites can't be racist.  




 At least Joyce didn't blow a perfect game again with this call.  




 I've been hearing recently that McGehee is playing injured. I say we put him on the DL until he's healthy, then platoon him and Duffy until of them wins the job.  




 I called the company last night but the package had shipped yesterday afternoon. I'll call UPS today to see what they can do.  




 I ordered a pair of jeans from Levi's last week. The money was withdrawn from my account, but I never got a confirmation email. Should I be worried?  




 [This]( http://imgur.com/a/HIUPg) is what I wore this weekend for a wedding. First time I've had to dress formally since high school 4+ years ago. I probably won't have to dress formally again for awhile, so I didn't want to put out for a full suit, so I tried to duplicate [this look](http://imgur.com/IbMzgfd). Jacket is from Nordstrom Rack, shirt/tie/pants from a local store, shoes from Ross. Hair product is Murray's Pomade.  




 As much as I'd like to see it, I don't think so. He was only dominant for a few years.  




 I'm loving the mixed game day thread. Welcome, Marlinsbros.  




 No protective helmet for Stanton tonight.
