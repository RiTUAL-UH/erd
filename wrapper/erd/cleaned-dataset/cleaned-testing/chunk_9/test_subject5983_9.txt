 Can't wait to see Idris Elba lose another loved one! 




 [Alan Partridge's Lip Syncing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ei0-wq9AqQ) 




 Most notably to me, Funny Games. 




 That is amazing. How did you get such fine white detailing? Eraser? 




 Nah man, you're an artist. And a pretty trippy one at that. 




 Me too. That was a positive statement.

 




 The Drop, tho. 




 Dude 




 It looks like a lithograph from an old novel or something, particularly an old copy of Huck Finn I had. I love it. 














 I love them all. Somehow I never caught Inherent Vice in theaters, and I've been waiting to see What We Do In The Shadows since I saw the trailers. Thanks. 




 Oh yes it is. Watched it with my very conservative mom once. 




 How the hell did I forget Four Lions in my description, it's one of my favorites. And I love In the Loop. 




 I'll have to check those out. Thanks for the list 




 I've been meaning to check that out. Thanks 




 Of course 




 Two of my absolute favorites 









 Love em all. I've seen all the Coen Brothers stuff more times than I can count, all of Guy Ritchie's best, and I've already seen Kingsman twice. 




 Thanks. Always happy to watch a classic. 




 I'll check it out. Which version? I'm guessing the original? 




 Definitely. I love everything Coen. 




 Oh, most definitely. The Naked Gun is amazing, and Airplane is one of my favorites.  




 Love it.  




 I just watched Alan Partridge and absolutely loved it. That dry, quick humor that's constant in the movie is my favorite. I watched The Trip as a follow up, and it was moderately funny, but not constant enough to have me dying like Partridge did.

Other movies with the kind of humor I'm looking for are In the Loop, Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Rushmore, In Bruges, The Guard, etc. 

Any suggestions?  




 I just saw The Boy Next Door in theaters yesterday.

It was hilarious fun to watch with friends, but it's far and above the worst film I've seen in a while. 




 Whoever edits these How To's is amazing. The timing of the cuts and the music makes the videos 10 times funnier. 




 If the script were written by a woman would it have been okay? 




 Anthony Fantano? 




 Joaquin Phoenix and anyone. 

Especially Reese Witherspoon in Walk the Line, or Amy Adams and Scarlet Johansson in Her. 




 Just thinking about it gives me chills.

"Not many people in California have basements."

"I do." 




 I can't tell from your comments in this thread: do you get upset when people use "underrated" incorrectly? 




 I also watch Last Week Tonight. 




 It looks really cool, and almost like Jennifer Lawrence. I think the eyes are too high, though. But what'd you use? The textures are great. 




 Well shit. I feel all cold and cynical now. 

I guess I took it as too much of a legitimate guide to the underlining themes of The Shining instead of a documentary about the cultural phenomenon it became and the obsessions it created. 

Thanks for pointing that out to me. 




 Really? I found that movie to be pretty worthless, if not frustrating. 

There were a few people in there with interesting theories and neat analyses, but they were overshadowed by the idiots talking about random shit. 

What was that lady talking about the drawings her kid made? Or the guy trying to prove Kubrick's face was in the clouds?

Plus it didn't seem very careful production-wise. It was more than obvious that everyone recorded themselves at home with mics of varying quality and no concern for background noise. I remember hearing kids pplaying behind some of the speakers. 









 1) The King of Comedy

2) Goodfellas

3) Taxi Driver

4) Wolf of Wall Street 

5) After Hours 




 Her. 




 Yeah the original was a bit spooky for me. 









 Myers actually later agreed with Kanye and said, "I'm, like, super proud to have been next to him." 




 The darkest of the dark. 




 Which is why Plemmons played Hoffman's son in The Master. 




 You are a crazy person. 




 That's what it was! Thank you so much. 




 I remember hearing a bit about being able to tell a lot about a man by how ugly his wife is. That's really all I remember. Any ideas? 




 Your dad is the coolest lookin motherfucker I have ever seen. ^So ^crisp. 




 Don't forget how great Gone Girl's sound mixing was. 




 cool

/r/movies is more of a casual discussion forum about film while /r/truefilm is more hardcore cinephiles discussing actual film theory and what have you. 




 I had a friend watch Antichrist on her first date.  




 Where'd you find this? 




 It's very bad. 

Bad enough to where it should be funny. 

It's not funny. 




 That's just water. 




 I hope you and Carter became the best of friends.

 [House of Cards, anyone?](http://imgur.com/salcoMO) 




 Your choices are wrong.  




 I think a big part of the movie was the fact that there were plotholes. The scene where she's recanting her stories to the FBI people and any questions from the Sheriff woman are shushed because of the preconceived notion of "innocent little Amy" and the media's role in how people perceive the couple and treat the case, overlooked evidence against her case in favor of their unfairly biased ideas, are pretty huge. Especially with the whole Nancy Grace parody thing running in the background. 




 I'd buy. 




 I was uptoke 1234! Let me taste that sweet, sweet karma gold!! 




 Go look up the movie "Riding the Bus with My Sister". She plays a retarded person in what I supposed to be a very dramatic and touching drama, but it's one of the most unintentionally funny movies I've ever seen.  




 How'd you get the black speckling so perfect? It looks fucking awesome. 









 Kevin Smith constantly talks about how his movies look like shit because he has no visual style. At least he knows. 




 Kid Cudi's Cudderisback over the instrumental of Ottoman is one of my favorites 




 Z-Bo made the cops leave a party I was at. 




 A Worms video without Gavin is sacrilegious. 




 That's weird as hell. I love it. 




 Is that the Space Needle? Kind of inapplicable. Cool poster regardless, though. 




 Marty McFly on the drums 




 Hey, at least you got some gold. 




 Hey Adam, how do you feel about piracy laws? 




 I'm praying they add the store again. So much fun to be had. 




 It looks great except for the inside of the mouth. The crest of the tongue is too defined and makes it look like he has two big squirrel teeth or something. 




 It's sideways. 




 Big Lebowski. Before the Devil Knows You're Dead. Punch-Drunk Love. Moneyball. Synecdoche, New York. Happiness.  




 Franco's five facts are the best five facts.
