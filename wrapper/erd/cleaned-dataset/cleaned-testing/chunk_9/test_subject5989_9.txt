 Colorado I can understand due to the snow, but Seattle? They rarely even get snow lol. I'm not complaining though, the more Subies the better :D 




 amazing! hardly any where I live lol 




 I may be moving to Seattle in December from Canada, glad to see some Subies out there :) 




 What would it realistically sell for do you think? 




 I am near Toronto! We are friends indeed :D 




 This is so many levels of awesome. 




 Is it really worth that much?
