 Are they bae? 




 Are you talking about me, dude? 




 Boogies down?
 




 Mad Twatter 




 It's a fairly normal thing to do. 




 Same, really. I've done one year of Uni and it was alright at first, but after Christmas it just become a drag. Now that I'm back home with nothing to do I simply play drink beer, play videos, read, or watch something on youtube/Netflix.

Regarding netflix recommendations, I dunno much about movies, but I watched Sin City 2 recently and it was pretty good. If you're interested in TV shows then Sense8 was a hoot, and I'm currently enjoying Attack on Titan, an anime. 




 Where are you from? I'm assume the USA from "summer break", if so, which state? 




 Happy bday dude 




 Hello everybody,

last night I had a dream and in this dream the power got shut down worldwide for a week

I wake up and see this article

In conclusion, buy a generator 




 Last night I was reading for a whopping five hours but only managed to bat out 200 pages, which is what? 40 pages an hour? 

I have this mate who says he can read faster than that and flamed me.

"that's

SUPER fast m8 :P

So, yeah. What tips do y'all have?

 Shame he's a hunter

 He's a hunter 




  tipped their hats to each other and rode off on their separate ways.

its a meme, you dip 




 It's $60k 




 Mine, PERSONALLY. How about yours? 




 Show some respect, guyberry thirdstein. 




  You're not the main character of the story, buddy.

Depends on the story, guy. 




 Well, it won a 25,000 Scottish literary prize with a 'mesmerising' work.

So, yeah probably 




 Oh man, why? 




 Yes, still. Can't fault a guy for dedication?

Also, was that just via memory you linked that? 




 What happened? 




 Downvoting the creator, thats fine 




 I want to lick Barbara and Mica's shoes. 




 She? 




 scared baby 




 Disregarding what you said about video games because it is irrelevant and nobody is talking about that (like really m8, what? where'd you even get that from?).

And yes, people being shot by police is obviously bad, but you're attaching a QQ sentimentality to it. We need to look at facts not "woah, what the hell, I can't believe that cop did that".

Thats how all cops get fingered (;)) as baddies.

 




 Yeah, well... 




 to counterweight the sentimentalisation;

piss off. 




 Maybe if they gay? I'd take it right home and turn it into a cumbox sorta thingy wingy 




 thats what a butt pad is, guy 




 looks like he deleted what he said. For context it was him asking about rumors whether Jack and Ray maybe didn't get along all that much. 




 Maybe I'm just being more attentive, but Jack has been really, really funny as of late. 




 "Lol"

Screw you, dude 




 I want to lick Barbara's shoes.

why the downvotes? 




 Ah right, cheers. Personally I think people are too sensitive over stuff like this, but eh, I'm not the one getting affected by it so I guess I can't really complain much! 




 As someone from a fairly undeveloped country, what IS the correct term? 




 How long did you live with him? 




 Trigger warning

 What'd you say before the edit, I wonder? 




 Tanktops and tooth gaps. Vogue Summer 2015. 




 Attention seeker
 




 Maybe you should reply the first time then 




 Where do you order from? 




 If one of my friends is doing a transmog run and I wish to tag along, I will always pass if a mount drops. Since I'm being boosted.

And its the same thing whenever they want to join on my runs. 




 What even happened with that? Why'd the co-pilot do it?
 




 To be fair, quotes in title, it has been 12 months and its from a different subreddit. 




 Lol'd but felt bad 




 . 




 I dunno, that sounds sorta fun 




 . 




 Not really, dude. There is diminishing returns with this sort of thing. It'll taper off and you'll just remain at the same level, probably after a week or less. 




 Solar flares maybe 




 Different game I think, mate. I'm Romania in this one 




 I'm sure it has. Modern though? Useless. 




 Is it wrong though, sunshine? 









 It's worth at at least a DOLLAR! 




 choo choo 




 Fuck. Sake. 




 Same shit 




 Regaining my mind isn't on my to-do list. Regaining my LAND, however... 




 Poor Matt (and Jeremy) 




 Matt is Chewbacca 




 Relax dude 




 Then he released his own "Ashensbox" for 25, which is overpriced considering what you get in it.

Not really sure if its a joke or not, but people buy them so, eh
