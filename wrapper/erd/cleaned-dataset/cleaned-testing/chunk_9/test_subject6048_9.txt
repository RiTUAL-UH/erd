 I wish I was this smart when I was 14 




 Sneak/lie your way in. I'm serious, if you're clever enough it probably isn't all that difficult. If your passion for history runs that deep make it an adventure and go. 




 If you're living with you're parents, move out and have them cut you off financially. Being independent and supporting yourself will be an immense source of newfound pride and freedom for you. Even if it sucks for a while and you don't like your job, it'll be worth it. You'll figure out what you like as you move forward. But like some of the other posters said on here, it's about moving in a direction, no matter what direction may be. 




 What would the job be? Would it be something you're interested in and how much would it pay?

Do you WANT to go to college? Or simply doing it to go through the motions because it's what people are "supposed to do"? 




 Apologies, I'm very ignorant on this subject, what is the significance of no visible craters? 




 NYers, myself include, don't take advantage of that website nearly enough. 




 Don't be lame. 




 Walk everywhere. It's the best way to experience the city. Pack a backpack up for the day with some water/book/laptop and just nomad it up around the city. Check out all the museums, parks, bridges, etc. 




 Beans!

Dried beans are super cheap, have no sodium/sugar and are an outstanding source of protein and fiber.
 




 This is an amazing prompt 




 Me too, friend. 




 Great scott! Greece has a government? 




 I've never gone to Brooklyn Bowl and had a bad time 




 NOoooOOOOOooOOOOOoooooo 




 Okay. 




 Call their customer service. 




 Don't care what uniform he wears, this guy is the man. 




 Step 1: Delete this post and submit it again without the capital letters.

Step 2: Get valuable advice because you didn't antagonize anyone. 




 What's this? An actual analysis posted on r/nfl and not just trade gossip or rehashed discussion topics? 




 Oh you mean the Best Book Ever? Would definitely call $3.50 a bargain for it. 

What translation do you have? Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky have what's regarded as the best one, though the below article argues against their version.

That being said, the part of your day with the girl is far more intriguing. 




 How are you doing now? Do you feel stronger now that you've made it through this? 




 I can't recommend Rodney Yee's "Moving Toward Balance" enough.

I bought this book and started Yoga without any advice or direction and gained such a comprehensive and spiritual understanding of it. Reading this and exploring it on my own gave me a deeper perspective on it than friends that had been going to classes. He teaches you step by step with properly detailed photographs, but continually teaches you the philosophy behind this movement.

A few months after I had gotten into this, I talked one of my friends into doing the P90X Yoga video (an intense 90 minute workout). His mom stopped by while we were doing this and was very pleased, as she herself is a yoga instructor and enthusiast. She went into her office to grab "the perfect book for him", and to my delight it was "Moving Toward Balance".

 Walk around outside for a bit, have a big breakfast, write down all of my reflections and conclusions from the trip. Writing everything down helps tremendously for me. 




 But is there an Earth twin? 




 Wow, how long does that typically take for people to complete? 




 During the day, and all I need is power/wifi. I was specifically referring to places within New York City, so while the poolside resort sounds appealing I don't think its a realistic option. 




 You can pull it off if you're careful enough. Keep in mind depending on your profession salaries tend to be higher in NYC.  




 Wow 1862, that's tremendous. Always worth checking out shops like that. 




 Browse the subreddit.... 




 That quote sounds like the advertisements I see for books on the subway. 




 I use this pretty often- http://www.timeout.com/newyork 




 They're going to have a less-talented league play during the NFL offseason. The Goodell-Leviathan continues to grow... 




 If there's a specific team you have in mind, try emailing both the team and the broadcasting station. I wouldn't be surprised if most of team's had these stored digitally. At least for the Giants, whenever they put highlight reels together on their website they always use the radio announcer's version of it. 




 Whether it's a particular cafe, hotel, park, etc. Looking for a good place a I can post up with my laptop for the day and work. 




 It's become completely unbearable to watch. 




 Purchase it, borrow it from someone you know, or just post up in a book store all day and read it. I'm not even going on some self-righteous don't torrent rant. Watchmen is an artistic masterpiece and to look at it on your computer/ipad screen is going to utterly dilute your experience.

You should be able to find it used pretty reasonably priced on Amazon or Ebay. 




 I feel a lot of the same sentiments as you, but what is the point of this post? You want fans to justify why they like characters? There's a lot of Batman comics because people like reading about Batman. Get over it.

 




 I think you may have forgotten to post the link 




 Walk the Brooklyn Bridge from the Financial District, Walk the Hy-Line on the west side.

EDIT: 

It's also worth browsing r/asknyc, people post questions like this pretty much daily. 




 It couldn't hurt to by some foam/padding separately and put it in there, otherwise you'd be sacrificing the great design/function of the UD packs for something that can be easily customized yourself. 




 Nice! 




 I use Ally, top notch customer service and website/mobile design.  




 Congratulations. That's so awesome, and takes a lot of self-discipline and growth to accomplish, keep working my friend, be proud. 




 I have this and love it: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UR8AI52/ref=pdp_new_dp_review

For the price point it can't be beat. If you're willing to spend, the Ultimate Direction vests look like the best option as they seem to wrap around your chest completely and will keep the contents of your pack super stable. 




 Such a great spot 




 Show up in your work out clothes, fill out a form and give them your ID. Pretty much all of the gyms will let you have a day to try out the gym and see if you like it. 




 Anyone have experience purchasing land and selling it years later after the market in the area has increased? Would love a direction to be pointed in as far as resources I can check out to learn more about this process.  




 Thanks, bud. 




 Income(x) - Rent(x) vs Income(Y) - Rent(Y) 




 As a noob, you might as well be throwing your money on the roullete table. That's fine, as long as you're willing to lose it. This is coming from someone who's in the same boat as you, complete noob until about 6 months ago. The best way to learn is by doing though. If you have an iphone, I'd suggest the app RobinHood as there are no transaction fees, though it is quite restrictive in the moves you can make. 

Just keep in mind you're probably going to lose a substantial amount of whatever you put in. As many in this community will tell you, unless you can do a top down evaluation of the company and rationalize what you're buy/selling, then all you're doing is gambling. 




 If you have an iPhone, RobinHood has zero cost per trade. Many restrictions in what's available, though.

As people in this sub will tel you, Vanguard is always going to be a superior alternative to the Wealthfront types. 




 Cook your favorite, tastiest dish, and sprinkle an ample portion of cocaine on top of it. 




 I'd throw it into a Savings account. Wait till you have $1000 in there and then open up an account with Vanguard using it (Pretty sure their minimum deposit is $1000). 




 I like betterment more. This site did some great reviews of similar services: http://investorjunkie.com/best-robo-advisors/ 




 I've had a lot of the same issues you're bringing up (still do to some extent). The book The War of Art resonated with me tremendously, might for you to http://www.amazon.com/The-War-Art-Through-Creative/dp/1936891026.

Also I've found exercising affects me positively incredibly on my psyche. Don't know if this is something you already do, but regular weight lifting/running has been the greatest aid for me.

You're 100% on the right path, encourage yourself. To put things in perspective, there's many people that go there entire lives having the issues you've mentioned but never take any steps to improve upon them.  




 If you love it, then don't think of it as studying. You're simply engrossing yourself in something you enjoy.  




 This is clearly a spoiler. 




 That's disappointing to hear. Sounds like both him and Goyer behaved pretty childishly though.  




 The first Blade was a unique, tremendous film. Other two were pretty awful. 




 What happened during Blade 3? 




 Why is he a douche?  




 Yeah definitely don't take 2.

Couple more piece of advice: Do some exercising tonight/tomorrow morning. And meditate tonight/tomorrow morning. If it's something you don't normally do, check out r/meditation or google it for some quick tips, dosn't take more than 10 minutes and will help tremendously. 




 I'm completely inexperienced in what you're dealing with, but I wouldn't withdraw on the 401(k). Pretty sure you'll take a big tax hit, and will basically be undoing a lot of the work that investment was doing for you. 




 This is intriguing, and resonates quite a bit with me. Do you have some examples of what real economic assets you'd be investing in? I agree completely with your rationale, but am quite new to the investing world.
