 It's such an amazing cotton candy look! I love it.   




 Hi!  I've recently misplaced my Force charger and was wondering if anyone had one they didn't need anymore.  Please let me know how much you'd like for it.  Thank you!! 




 Ours easily poops 3x-4x on each walk.  At the end it's just... Very very soft serve lol.  If we don't go on a walk, he goes 2x a day.  Definitely more if we keep saying "poo poo" lol. 




 I loved those books!!!  Soaking their bread in milk is what I remember most :D 




 Agreed!  We just bought the soundtrack and it's beautiful. 




 No, I'm clearly Benjy lol. 




 Howard looks great! 




 It's definitely slow.  I'm still working on figuring out other problems with it. But at least now I can login 100% of the time after disabling that backup plugin :( 




 Hi RedBull7!  I didn't post a link to my blog because I'm never sure if it's considered "promotion" or not on Reddit.  I always get so worried so I just figured I'd skip posting it until I was asked.  I did respond to Yurishimo after with a link to my blog as well as a list of plugins :)   




 Yes! That plugin is awesome.  It showed that my Ready! Backup was sucking up the most resources and I've disabled it since.  Jetpack is definitely #2 on the list and I'm trying to figure out if I really need it.  Thank you for your help standard_staples :) 




 I'm really such a noob and I'm not sure which resources it is lol.  My hosting company pointed me to the "resources" icon on my cpanel and it shows that I've maxed out the usage.  You were absolutely right on the backup plugin being the problem.  I've since installed p3 profiler and apparently the Ready! Backup was taking up the most juice. Since I've disabled it, the blog is much better.  Thank you so much for dropping in and helping me out :) 




 Hi jedidave!  I've never heard of Cloudflare and will check it out.  Thank you! 




 I was getting the 500 server error as well.  I figured it was because of my resources issue since I never had that problem before my blog started to slow down.  I definitely took your advice and took off a security plugin as long as quick cache.  I'm really trying hard to keep the list of plugins on my site to a minimum since I'm so worried about the resources issue lol.  Thank you for your help Yurishimo! 




 Hi tabrisrp!  I dropped iThemes and the Google XML Sitemaps.  Thank you for your help :D 




 Hi lingben! I downloaded that p3 plugin you recommended, and it helped SO MUCH.  Apparently Ready! Backup was the culprit.  I disabled that plugin and it's running much better now.  You're right, jetpack is definitely using the 2nd most amount of resources and I'm trying to figure out if I really need it.  I'm pretty sure my blog is slow because of me, but I will definitely check out webhostingtalk if I change my mind.  Thank you so much for your help!! 




 Hi texxs!  I do have access to my cpanel so I will definitely take your advice and deactivate my plugins one at a time.  If I can't get this to work on my own, I will DEFINITELY contact you.  This problem is really bumming me out.

Thank you 




 Hi!  I have a personal blog that has been having some major problems in the past 6 months.  My hosting company says that I'm using up all of my resources and suggested I deactivate my plugins.  I have trimmed the list down but it hasn't seemed to help.  Can anyone point me in the right direction on how to fix this problem?  Thank you! 




 That looks so delicioussssss 




 That's my expression when I'm sick too hahahah.  I hope your puggy feels better. 




 The hashbrown part is really weird.  Maybe cheeseburger and fries?  I think this may be ok as a dip.  Definitely super gross as a soup. 




 Awwwwwww 




 I'm loving both looks!   




 I'm only on season 3 and so far it's been great.  I'm a little worried for he up coming seasons now... Ehhhh 




  I've been binge watching Criminal Minds and it's so amazinggggggg.   




 So pretty! I love the color combination and your cut.  Your whole look is beautiful!  




 Thank you!  That makes total sense.  I am indeed in LA.   




 That does help!  Thank you so much johnjgraff :)  I was also wondering why this lot wouldn't have a physical address.  It seems like there are addresses across the lot but not for the lot.  Why are lots always listed as 0? 




 Hi! My husband and I are currently interested in a piece of land that is zoned LARE20.  We'd like to eventually build a single family home on it and was wondering what it actually meant.  We were also asking for a physical address to take a look at the lot and the realtor just told us that it was LARE20... Any help would be appreciated! Thank you :) 




 Tres Tres Leches Cakes! 




 Exactly...but we're supposed to cut our water usage in CA so it seems like not watering our laws would be the easiest choice.  Nope.. not here.  F your showers... water your lawns! 




 My dog is pretty quiet, so his way of begging is by staring.  A few times at night I've caught him 2 feet from my face staring.  He wanted to go pee and I was watching a movie on my laptop in the dark.    




 You're not ticklish in your armpit???   




 You're not allowed to let your front lawn go yellow in my city.  Kind of stupid since I'm in California and we have a major water issue.   




 The Matrix.  I'm assuming since they don't have a grasp on technology, this movie would freak them out big time. 




 :( 




 Hi Trolol420!  You can definitely add a little bit of "extra" oil after the trace but some soap makers argue that you can't determine which oils become saponified during the process.  Since most of the saponification happen during the first 24 hours, even after trace it's still working.  I have no idea if this is true, but I have also read that some soap makers add more expensive oils to superfat the soap after trace.  Because they say that the qualities are retained.  I personally haven't experimented with adding oils after, but I don't see why you couldn't.  Jojoba is pretty shelf stable so even if there's extra I saponified, I wouldn't be as worried about DOS compared to grapeseed or flax oils.  I'm not sure if I helped or not lol lol.

 




 I know that he's unbelievable unhealthy but.. i love him and want to squeezeeeee himmm so badlyyyyy.  Cuddle buddy!  Imagine all that room for tummy rubs :D 




 sooo freaken cuteeeeeeeeeeeeee!!! 




 Wooooo Las Vegas would really be nice.  Finally we won't have to pay $900+ to stay in a crappy hotel for 4 nights!  Late night steak and eggs, catch a cirque show, play some slots.... Vegas is definitely the way to go!   




 Those are beautiful!  Just wondering... does your mom happen to have a recipe for sun cakes? Those are my fav :D
