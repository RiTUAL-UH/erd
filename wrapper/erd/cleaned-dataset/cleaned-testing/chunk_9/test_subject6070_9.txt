 Part of it is the area Charleston is difficult to find a job outside of culinary f b. I got stuck bartending for years until I finished my masters ( I am a teacher now). Here are a couple things you could do outside culinary but they may not pay as well, work for an autism intervention program pretty easy to get hired on but stressful. You could get an ESL certificate and teach, or you could try and find volunteer work in the field you hope to go into and hope a job opens up. What field do you want to go into? Do you have any connections to people who "got out " of culinary? 




 I know what you mean I have been there for two years this is the first time anyone has seemed ready to make the change. I bet you get more peoples wheels turning than you give yourself credit for. 




 That's awesome! I think living by example peaks peoples interest the same thing happened to me with friend who was Buddhist she just lived her life quietly but before I knew it I was asking her questions and reading books she had suggested. There is something to be said for letting someone come to you and offering guidance vs trying to force someone to see it your way. But I also wouldn't want to discredit anyone who is more vocal about it and creates change in a more aggressive way. There are many paths to veganism. 




 Seems to be more health motivated but I encouraged them to check out earthlings or cowpericy at some point. The chorus teacher had some questions about why I don't eat milk and eggs and I explained my issues with those industries I could tell he was a bit shocked to hear about it. The coach I think is trying to keep his weight in check but he has also had some great questions about the ethical side. 




 So I work at a high school and recently I have had several teachers take an interest in a vegan diet. I bring a vegan lunch everyday and bring a little extra for people to try if they want. The chorus teacher and his wife have decided to try being vegan for 6 weeks and I have given them cookbooks and websites to help them on their journey, and I am hoping it will stick once they see how easy it is. Also one of the wrestling coaches has been asking a lot of questions about my diet and he text me today to ask how to start a vegan diet. I am so excited for them and proud that just because of my vegan lunches 3 people are now trying a vegan diet!  Just wanted to share the good news with people who will get it . 




 It seems like you were trying to be original and find your style . at least you were never basic! 




 I believe you and its not your fault. I believe you and its not your fault.  I believe you and its not your fault. 
Rape is very difficult to deal with I never went to the police for similar reasons but I did get counseling which was very helpful.  




 My parents didn't sit me down either . they answered questions when I had them after I moved out , but never really taught me about money. They did encourage me to save and warned me about credit cards before I left but that was pretty much it. It also depends on where you teach , I teach at a poor rural school so I don't expect everyone to have a lot of finance experience. 




 I do a budget project with my econ kids and it is a struggle to get through it. But every year after they have started college I start getting e mails thanking me for the project, because they know how to get an apartment fill out their fafsa and apply for a car loan. Even if they don't get everything know that they are getting something. 




 Having a system in place for everything. I spent my first year so disorganized, year two was much better but I have some things I want to tweak. If you think a lesson could be better go ahead and make the changes you will thank yourself next year.  




 Women who think it's OK to have a glass of wine every now and then while pregnant. I know that it probably won't do any harm but why risk it . you really can't give up wine for 9 months. And before anyone hose crazy I am a woman and I have given up wine for 9 months  




 South Carolinian here, sc is in the bible belt and there for subjected to blue laws which prohibit certain items from being sold due to moral reasons. For example when I was in college you could only by food and meds before 1pm on a Sunday. The bar I worked at had to close at midnight on Saturday because we couldn't sell any booze on Sunday. The idea was that people should be spending that time at church and with their family not shopping or getting drunk. We won't let you drink on Sunday but you don't have to wear a helmet on a motorcycle. God dammit my state is backwards. 




 He is very thoughtful most of the time after I explained it he totally understood. 




 Omg I had to explain to my boyfriend how tacky this was ,the fact that he didn't already know still causes me great concern. 




 I took it twice ( I got an Mat and hadn't had a world or us history class in about 5 years) the test was set up similarly like same percentage us world Econ gov questions but the essays were very different. I had to write one about the Chinese empire and another one I had to write about the transcontinental railroad. 




 Yeah ground and raw the trick is to put 1 part flax into three parts water and let it sit for a few minutes it becomes a great binding agent (egg replacement) for baked goods. I also will put it in with soy yoghurt and let it sit overnight , or add it to a smoothie which is kind of grainy and not my favorite but it works. 




 Check out founding brothers does a great job covering early us history 




 Hey I am all for trying the natural way before taking drugs. You have definitely given me some things to think about. I am sorry that I can't do the oily fish I know it has great health benefits but I haven't eaten meat in 17 years I feel at this point it would make me sick both physically and mentally. Do you have any plant based suggestions for omega 3s I eat a lot of flax and chia seeds so I feel I am prob OK o. The 6s 




 I eat 95% vegan I am on my feet all day (teacher) and practice yoga a few times a week. My skin is much better since I made these changes . dairy breaks me out with in 72 hours. I could definitely eat less sugar so I will try that change first. Thanks for the advice. 




 I have an appointment in June so I will see what she says but it has been so frustrating dealing with the break outs every couple weeks. I wanted to see if sca had some suggestions I could research before I go so I know the pros and con's of the products 




 I get hormonal acne but can't take birth control because I get blood clots. Are their any alternatives that could help with this? My current skin care regiment works well other than the week before my period. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 




 Diva cup is the best investment I ever made. Who knew I could grow so attached to a little piece of medical silicon 




 I really love teaching native American history unfortunately it has been all but cut out of my states us history standards. 




 Since you are touching on history I would like to bring up two men involved in the desegregation  movement just after the civil warBooker t Washington and WEB Debois. Washington believed in gradual steps to end slavery and wanted African Americans to focus on getting jobs that didn't threaten white people because of his approach he was able to get funding from whites to send African Americans to school who otherwise would not have been able to go. Debois believed that African Americans should seek full inclusion and pursue jobs as lawyers and doctors because of his efforts many were inspired to get jobs once thought of as off limits to blacks. Both men had a positive impact for their cause one approach was gradual the other was a bit more extreme. I think veganism is similar if it seems approachable to omnivores they may be more likely to try it . if you tell them how awful the meat industry is they may be more likely to try it. I think the end goal is the same and ultimately you have to go with what you think will be most effective. 




 Great advice ! 




 Haha I was just thinking about learning to ride a motorcycle. I have always been afraid because I have awful ADD. But it does appear we have much in common. If you could have dinner with any 3 people dead or a live who would you invite and what would you eat? 




 I watch hardcore porn, travel solo , love camping and hiking, drink bourbon neat, and hate chick flicks. I have been told some of these things are manly but I think its just personal preference. I also do lots of girly shit. 




 Honestly I had to think of it like learning a new language. I had to practice everyday if I wanted it to get better. Even when I didn't feel like it even when I felt miserable in my new body I practiced my new thoughts. It is hard but worth it I still have days that I feel gross but they are few and far between. In box me if you ever want to talk hang in there it gets better. 




 Or bi 




 I dated a guys who was 38 when I was 24 we were both bartenders. he was a lot of fun at first but then I realized he liked dating younger women because he didn't want to grow up. After a couple months we split because I realized he had no ambition in life and an affinity for coke. We were different races so no one ever thought he was my dad or anything but we often got questioning looks from people. 




 I went through this when I was in recovery for my eating disorder. I started doing a guided meditation on body acceptance that helped me out a lot. Also I tried to pick body parts that I liked and focus on them after 6 months I was feeling sexy and healthy.  




 James k Polk is a good one Ohio is about kent state , born in the USA is ab coming back from veitnam . 




 I think that it is odd for a male teacher to hug a female student. Most male high school teachers are super aware of how things can be taken out of context and err on the side of caution. There should be no secrets about what a teacher does with a student especially when it comes to affection. If your friend is uncomfortable then she should speak up but like others have mentioned she should be sure about what happened because it could potentially ruin a good teachers career. Even if it is investigated and he is found innocent there will always be doubt's about that teacher. If she doesn't want to report it I think she could be proactive and tell him that she does not want to be touched. Hope that helps a little. 




 Noticed that at Sullivan's I used to live on iop it happens every once in a while not sure why though.  




 It sounds like she is being very manipulative. New vegans often go through a crazy my eyes have been opened now I need to show everyone else phase. However it is often better to lead by example than try and force someone to become vegan which is exactly what she is trying to do. Ask yourself this do you want to be with someone who will try to manipulate you into doing what they want or someone who will try to educate you and then let you make your own decisions. I am guessing that this type of behavior will extend past food eventually. With holding affection in any relationship for any reason other than you genuinely don't feel like it is a bit crazy.
