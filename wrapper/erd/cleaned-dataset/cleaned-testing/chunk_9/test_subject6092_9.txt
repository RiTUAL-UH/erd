 That Verizon one pissed me off. That one I forgot, but it was so blatant. 




 My ticket in 3d was under $13. And I live in CT 




 There's one scene I remember where it's basically a zoom in on the Mercedes logo then after about 4 seconds it pans up. I know there was some more, but I can't remember  




 More like T-Rex, raptor(s) and big fish Dino vs genetically engineered T-Rex. That scene felt good at the end. 




 So I loved the movie. One of my first impressions about 5 minutes in is oh that's Judy Greer. I like her! And then oh no horrible acting and fairly cheesy so far. And then it got nostalgic. And then it got somewhat funny and then we were being introduced to characters. Then it got tense and that tension turned into bad-assery. I would recommend it. Perfect movie theatre movie. I'll probably go see it in a theatre again. Worth it. Just don't expect it to be written well. If you go into a jurassic park movie expecting brilliant writing you clearly didn't look at the poster. The seller of this movie is the thrill, Chris Pratt being hunky and the magic felt from the original.  




 Any tips?  




 I'm looking for informative reads. Thanks! 




 So I've become fairly interested in the paranormal and I'm wondering if there are any informative books about the paranormal? I'm talking creatures and all sorts of that jazz. Thank you! 




 So I recently got the xbox one and I've been playing FIFA 13 since it came out. Would it be worthwhile to buy 15, it for a few months and then get 16? Or should I just hold out for 16? 




 Those are nice too! 




 Yeah it is tough to read, but they're pretty nice looking 




 Does any other guy here want a Germany jersey? Those are beautiful  




 This is my first time watching women's soccer. I love it as much as I do men's soccer.  









 It really hurt to see that Elton Brand one, as a 76ers fan. I was pretty excited about him.  




 I hope he comes into his own. Loved him in FIFA 13, became an absolute beast for my Aston Villa squad.  




 I'm looking at transferring to NYU from a community college and I'm just wondering about the experience some of you may have had transferring.  














 So I have two semesters left in a two year university and I'll be applying to transfer to four year universities come fall. I went into this two year university with my eye on epidemiology, but I kept my heart and my eyes open. I've bounced around from thinking about French, history and psychology. I have my eyes and heart set on epidemiology now. I'll be graduating from this two year school with a liberal arts degree, and then I plan on getting my bachelors in something else. I'm thinking biological sciences, but is there another major that would be better preparation?  




 Anywhere I can listen online? 




 Wth him being a Yankee I'm sure he will start if he keeps it up 




 One of the best movies I've ever seen. Didn't care for how long it was it was brilliant 




 The one I work at doesn't, that's probably a southern thing 




 This is the truth 




 Every Lowe's I have been in has wifi 




 If I recall correctly, Kershaw had a rough start last year, and then he finishes with the lowest ERA in his career. I might as well keep bombarding trade offers. Once in MLB the Show I sent a trade offer about 50 times and the other team accepted.  




 I don't think anyone would. His average is terrible, but he's Jose and Jose still has a good amount of RBI and HR production.  




 I've been thinking about Tanaka, especially as a Yankees fan. I lost Wainwright and I'm trying to find another top gun. I've got Greinke, and he's been unbelievable, but I think my staff is deep enough where I can take the Tanaka risk.  




 I've been sending Kershaw's owner in my league a flurry of trade offers and he hasn't budged. I guess his owners really like him, as they should.  




 So I'm looking around my league and I'm seeing guys like Neil Walker, George Springer, Ryan Zimmerman, Anibal Sanchez, Carlos Gonzalez and many other players that are not playing as well as it seems they should be able to. 

What are your prime buy low candidates right now?  




 Damn it I had a dream I was going to say this on here, but that dream was before he was even signed... 




 Sounds good, thanks!  




 Okay so I'm gonna say thanks for the pretty quick reply, but I'm looking at these and I don't know what they are. Can you tell me why this stuff works for me? I don't mean to sound snobby, I just don't know this stuff and I'm trying to learn a little.  




 So soon I'll be coming onto a decent amount of money, and I will be looking to invest at most $2,500 of it for now. 
I'm 21 years old, in college and I work part time making roughly $360 every 2 weeks. Right now I make it paycheck to paycheck, but once this money comes in (probably in the next 3 months) I will have a good safety net from it. 
I just want to turn this money into more money so I can pay some of my student loans off quicker.
I want that money to be safe though. 
I don't have any holdings aside from a 401k with about $2000 in it. (is that a holding?) 
No big debts yet, but I'll have some once I transfer to a 4 year school.
No house, no car, girlfriend is fairly needy though.
Thank you.
Also, I really have no clue what to do with this, but I'm a quick learner so if I could get any tips on books I could read to become a better investor that wold be really appreciated. Thanks again. 


 




 **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

I will be using the laptop for school and gaming, as well as listening to a lot of music and watching a lot of movies and tv shows. I like to use Microsoft word and all that jazz. For games I will typically be playing GTA, FIFA, Cities Skylines and some various sport simulation games. 

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

My maximum budget would be nothing higher than $1600.


**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Probably won't be buying for about a month or so... I hope that doesn't actually matter. I don't mind if it's out of date, I'm just looking for an idea of what I need. 

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Everything, tower, os, monitor, keyboard, mouse, controller, etc I'm not too sure

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Connecticut, USA

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Not reusing anything

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

No overclocking

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

I would like a large amount of storage

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Don't know

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**
I would like a copy of windows 7 included in the budget. 
 




 There's nothing unoffensive with your attacking strategy to be a counter attack which looks like Floyd's style after watching some videos of him boxing.  




 Part of combat is preventing attacks which is exactly what Floyd seems to do.  




 I watched the Manny and Floyd match, and I actually really enjoyed it. It seemed clear to me that Mayweather won because he dictated the pace every round except for two or three and when he was on the offensive it seemed well planned and much more impactful than Pac's offense. So after the fight I browse Facebook and a lot of people are saying it's bullshit that Pac lost and it's embarrassing how Mayweather ran around all fight. Before watching I did my research and expected Mayweather to win, and quite frankly I thought it would t be too close, and it really wasn't that close in my eyes. 
So when I check this subreddit out a couple days after the hype I notice that no one is really complaining about the fight and I figure that's because the people that go on here now actually know boxing.
I think Boxing might slide into competition for my 4th or 3rd favorite sport, behind baseball and soccer.

Also I have a question, was Ali more of a tactician (like people say Floyd is)? That's what my friend who is a small boxing fan said.  




 He's got a strong voice for the job too. Unfortunately it's the broadcast team and not the broadcaster.  




 I love watching that bat flip by A-Rod, but I hate when I have to watch it because it means he struck out. 




 Shulman has been the one I've hated the least. 




 I'm sure the average baseball fan wouldn't sound as forced as Olney or as annoying as Kurkjian. I mean that act sounded like someone reading right off a script and then someone with no acting experience trying too hard.  




 It's disgusting, I can respect it if you're a fan of one of the teams you are watching, but when it's clear as fucking possible that you're rooting for a certain team in your commentary you don't belong.  




 Wow, first time watching Sunday night baseball in a few years and this is the most disappointing commentary I have ever experienced. They're not talking about anything interesting, when they talk it's absolutely one sided conversation or they're repeating stuff (West Virginians). It's terrible, I don't know if it's because I'm older now or if Kruk, Schilling and Shulman are terrible. They seem to jump to conclusions, make terrible attempts at jokes, repeat themselves and circle jerk.
