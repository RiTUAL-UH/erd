 Thank you! Means a lot to me. 




 It is funny how we are so caught up in our lives that we fail to notice the little things around us. The flower we miss on our way to work, the smile we dont return, the homeless guy we miss; the list goes on and on. We are so drawn into these screens around us-the phones in our pocket, the laptops on our table, the watches on our hand- that we never catch the present as it slowly drifts by. Perhaps this is why I failed to notice the little changes around my room, the occasional shifting of the pillows, the curtain moving at night or the random noises at night. I dont believe in the paranormal, never did, and probably never will, but what I witnessed today did change the lens through which I view this world. 

It all started when I got my own room (which is a pretty big deal for a teenager) my room was my home, my shrine, and most importantly, my bubble from the outside world. Did badly on the test? To the room it is. Mum scolding me? To the room I go. The harsh reality of life getting to me? To the room I run. Although I always enjoyed trying to fall asleep while staring at some poster on the wall, I always felt strange going to sleep, something just didnt feel right. I would wake up and forget all about it and then go on staring at some screen, getting updates from people I couldnt care less about, liking my way through social conventions and texting my abstract emotions through an assorted selection of emojis. The day would end and I would just lie on my bed trying to sleep. At first, it was tolerable-the curtains moving, the sounds, the occasional weird shapes in the shadows. 

I tried to rationalize it as much as I could, maybe it was the wind, or maybe it was my exhausted teenage mind that was playing tricks on me, but then things started getting weird. The sounds slowly evolved into the sounds of someone punching, the carpet moving, and the lights giving out for no reason. Like any other teenager, I told my parents and complained to my friends but soon forgot about it when the next season to my favorite show came out. Things got better and I again got lost in the labyrinth of the web. Little things still escaped my ever-decreasing attention span. The screen had become a life support for me and I was glued to it from dusk till dawn.

All that changed today. Today I realized how big the little things were. Today I realized that the carpet moving was not just my brain playing with me, that the punching sound was not the wind, that the lights giving out was not a weird coincidence. Today started out as a normal day, I woke up by the 6A.M alarm on my phone, yawned for a while and then put my feet to the ground. I felt something and looked down to see a hand clenching my right foot. A rush of adrenaline shot through my body and frantically kicked the hand and ran for the door. I turned around before locking it shut and what I saw made me sick to my gut. I saw a man under my bed. He was just lying there, looking me right into my eyes and grinning. I locked the door and ran to my parents. We called the police and he was arrested. They recovered a bag of chips, a blanket and a kitchen knife; he was carrying nothing and had no name. 

This shook me to the bones. It was then I realized that the little things were not little. That someone had been under my bed for the whole time. The punching noises, the curtains moving and the weird shadows were an actual person. And no one knows what he was thinking of, what he could have done.
The police told us that he had escaped from a mental facility and had been on the run for the better part of the month. A month he spent under my bed, right under me, coming and going through the verandah at night.

A year has passed and I still check under my bed each night, notice changes and freak out if I see anything new around me. I don't do this because I am paranoid. I do this because I dont want to miss out the little things.

Because it is the little things that count.
