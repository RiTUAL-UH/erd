 I haven't seen the playthrough so this is a serious question: could it be possible the person playing just didn't use the systems? I've played plenty of games where I didn't use some of the systems.  




 I think that's why people like it. You can tell everyone is having so much fun acting so dumb. 




 Hmm, sometimes I'll just say black because that's what color they mostly are, but mostly I'll just say they're black with some orange mixed in. 




 This was a nightmare to put together! I've never had so much trouble putting furniture together. Those pegs. Those damn pegs!

Does look great though. 




 Where did that Saving Private Ryan come from? It looks great! 









 Except for, you know, misquoting it. 









 I'm going to throw Robert Pattinson out there. I think he's shown he has acting chops, looks young, right body type, and can do an American accent. Don't know about wittiness though. He does seem fun in interviews.

And if it weren't for Xmen, I'd say Nicholas Hoult.

But if we're talking about more realistic choices, I agree with those saying Logan Lerman. 




 all of them 




 It was interesting at first, but after hearing/seeing it every time they perform with little variation it feels stale. I think it's good, but boring.

I kind of can't wait to get huge performer Lady Gaga back. 




 Seriously? I find that super interesting considering how many number one hits she's had. 




 I don't know, I think back to when Buried came out and people were wondering how a movie about a guy in a box could be good and it ended up being solid. Granted it has different circumstances than what I'm doing. But I think it'll all be in the execution. 

I do appreciate all of your input though. It's given me a lot to think about.  




 Well in a situation where you are severely injured and in the middle of the woods, I think it would definitely take priority over other things.  




 There wouldn't be any "same as they were before the accident" because it starts immediately after the accident. We don't see the person before the accident. 

They wouldn't be running around. They are severely injured so it's them getting from point A to point B. That's why I'm wondering if a story can still be good if the character doesn't develop.  




 Well the accident that stranded her also killed a loved one, but honestly, beyond wanting to survive and live, there is nothing she wants. 




 In the context of the story, all they want is to live.  




 Essentially it is sort of a bare bones survival story of a person stranded in the woods for a few days. They are injured and can't do much physically. I'm trying to figure out how to develop the character when they are the only character. 

I'm also wondering if a story can be good without character development.  




 They are stranded after an accident. The physical condition they are in would not allow them to hunt. They are also there for only a few days. 

I like the example of dreaming at night. But even in a dream, I'd run into the same problem of trying to deliver exposition and character development with only one character.  




 Yes they are trying to survive after an accident. It has a cold opening that starts immediately after the accident. But it's not like Cast Away where they are stranded for months. They are only stranded for a few days so going crazy doesn't seem likely.  




 I'm writing, or at least trying to, a story that takes place entirely in the woods and with only one character. How would you go about developing the character, defining who they are, and showing an arc?

Internal monologue wouldn't fit with the story and talking out loud seems clunky. Can I make it work?

Does a character need to be developed or have an arc for the story to be good?

Help? 




 You might want to delete that and pm it to me for your own privacy 




 I'll just email it to you using Google drive and it should give you an option to download it.  




 I can send it to you in a Google drive. Would that work? 




 I'd love if you gave it a shot!  




 This is it! 




 I'm incredibly flexible! Two weeks would be great! But like I said, I'm flexible! 




 I guess something more low key. Something modern, moody, and slow. While editing the short, I was listening to a lot of drone and ambient music. 




 More symphonic  




 It's all narrated  




 Good idea! The full thing isn't posted anywhere due to it not having any music, but I did post a [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB-FYkQr-_4) the other day! It'll hopefully give an idea of tone. 




 I recently just finished editing a short film I spent 7 months on. I'd love to have it be a 100 percent original film, so I'm looking for someone who'd be interested in scoring it.

I'm going to just put it out there so I don't waste anyone's time: I don't have money. This has been a passion project of mine that some friends were kind enough to help me with. I'm not saying that I expect someone to score it for free, but if I did pay someone, it wouldn't be a lot purely because I just *don't* have a lot.

Now that that's out there, let me tell you about the film. It's a small scale crime story about a cop bringing down two criminals. It's heavily inspired by classic film noir, but takes place in the modern day setting. It also takes a somewhat existential look at death.

I really could see some drone/ambient music fitting it well. But I'm not experienced in music, so I'm open to anything really.

I've done music for my own shorts before, but they're never good, so I'd love to have someone who actually knows something about music do the score.

If this isn't a good place for this post, could someone point me in the direction of a more proper subreddit?

Thank you so much! 




 I don't know if this is it. I distinctly remember Brad trying to read the name of the person the next email was from and being interrupted every time until he finally just yelled. 




 So while going through some bombcast videos, I was reminded of a fairly recent podcast episode where during the emails section, Brad read an email that led to a rather gross/disturbing discussion. The crew kept talking about it despite Brad trying to change the subject by going to the next email. Every time he tried to transition to the next email, the guys would interrupt him and continue the conversation.

Anyone know what I'm talking about?  




 As someone who's studied forensics, any time someone is hurt/killed and there's blood/gore, I automatically get super critical of the realism. I hate myself for it because it will sometimes ruin movies for me.  




 You should check out The One I Love. It's a great comedy/drama with a strange scifi twist. Feels very much like it could be an episode of The Twilight Zone.  




 As a guy in the singles ward who *didn't* go on a mission, this suuuucks. RMs taking all the women.  









 Great! Thanks for contributing and helping this sub get started! 




 [Just did it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTitleThenStory/comments/2u5n9h/lock_void/) 









 Hello, I made a subreddit that I feel could be the sister subreddit of this place.

/r/FirstTitleThenStory is another kind of writing prompt subreddit I made where instead of a traditional prompt, the prompt is just a title. Nothing else. No other information. I thought it'd be an interesting experiment.

Is this something anyone would like? 




 Hey everyone! This is a subreddit where someone submits a "title" and people will reply with a story based off of that title! The idea behind this is to allow users to get even more creative!

Think of it as a writing prompt, but instead of a synopsis, all you have to go off of is a title. No genre, no style, no nothing.

Let me know if you have any questions or ways to improve this place!

Hopefully this will be a fun thing that will survive!

Edit: I'll post a title a day until the sub grows a bit. Hopefully it will! 




 You should see Take This Waltz. He does a good job playing a normal husband in that.  




 I guess for me it's the number of films I have with alternate box art designs. 




 I think for me the reason I tend to get a steelbook over a normal one is because I see movies as works of art, so I think the cover art should reflect that. I don't just want my collection to be good. I want it to *look* good as well. I personally think most movies have terrible or generic cover art so that it's easier for them to sell, which is understandable. They have to make money.  I also think the blue cases throw off some good cover art.

Most steelbooks I come across have more interesting artwork and can get away with being more abstract so that's what's appealing about them to me. But if the steelbook art looks the same as the regular art, then I'll just go with the regular one since it'll be cheaper usually. And in some cases, the steelbook will have worse art. Like [these](http://i0.wp.com/www.pissedoffgeek.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/breaking-bad-steadman.jpg?resize=752%2C619) Breaking Bad ones. Sure, they're interesting, but I jus think they don't look good.

But that's the thing, it's all just preference. 

I'd have to say for me personally, it's steelslipcoverregular blu

But you're not idiotic for not liking steels. It's just a preference, man! 




 Why? 




 I think "not big on it" and "atheism" are two different things.  




 I'm looking at getting a new laptop. It's preowned and has FCP9 on it already. I'm used to and comfortable with FCP7. How much trouble will I have adjusting? Is FCP9 bad?

Edit: Shows how much me and the guy selling the laptop knows. Didn't know FCP 9 wasn't a thing.  




 I'm looking at a new laptop that is preowned. I'm used to and comfortable editing with FCP7. The laptop has FCP9 on it. How different is 9 from 7. Will I have trouble adjusting? 




 This is where dreams come true. Good luck everyone! 




 Looks like Eddie Vedder  




 It's interesting you bring up 2001 because the man who did the visual effects for 2001 also did the visual effects for the creation of the universe scenes in Tree of Life. 




 I saw it when it came out a couple of years ago. I declare it a masterpiece. 




 Warriors of Virtue is the sickest 




 Well, I mean, 1999 was like 15 years ago and 1990 was like 25 years ago. A lot has changed in cinema since then. A lot of advancements in technique and technology. It's perfectly reasonable to assume most movies of the 90s haven't stood the test of time. If you're someone who was born in the 70s, then the 90s probably don't feel old. But if you're someone who was born in the late 90s, that was an entire lifetime ago.

I don't consider the 90s "old" but it *was* over a decade ago. Heck, 1990 was a quarter of a century ago! It sounds old when you say it like that! 




 Yep. As a big guy who can't grow a beard there's no hope for me :( 




 But purple rain 




 I made a short film and I wanted to give a gift to the people who helped me make it. A physical copy of the film. I know absolutely zero about photoshop so I was looking for someone who is creative and artistic to create the cover art for the Bluray case. I can be contacted through PM. 




 I mean, to be fair, the no chemistry thing works because she doesn't want Bruce Wayne anymore.  




 I think the core concept and story of the first Saw is incredible. However I just think the execution missed the mark a little. I still love it and think it's a great movie though.  




 The thing is though, while Middle East would be really cool, I just think there wouldn't be enough variety in animal life.

And the reason I said Galapagos is because I think there's good variety in the geography and some interesting animal life. But yeah, you're totally right in that it'd feel too similar to 3.

Another cool one would be the Alaskan wilderness, or heck, let's just go to Antarctica! 




 Something like a fake So Paulo would be cool. Have some wilderness but also some favelas on steep hills. 

Maybe something Middle East inspired with dessert environments and canyons. 

Also since Far Cry 4 didn't have enough of it, it'd be cool to have one that mostly took place in the mountains. 

Galpagos Islands would be pretty sick! 




 As someone who just watched Saw yesterday, most of that movie is like a 6/10. But those last 20 minutes, when you see everything come together and play out, it's like a 10/10. 




 I enjoy a song that has a nice build up to a big release. What are some of your favorite crescendo songs? 




 Quite literally  




 We always hear the villain say something along the lines of "You and I are a lot alike." And the hero will say "I'm nothing like you."

Are there any instances where the villain and the hero are indeed just alike? 




 Essentially making the movie from the perspective of the antagonist.  




 I'm writing something and was wondering if you guys knew of any movies that tell a beautiful love story between two gay people. 

I feel like most movies portray gay people in an unrealistic way. I'm looking for movies that portray gay people in a realistic and beautiful way? Brokeback Mountain would be an obvious one, but what are some romance movies about two gay people? 




 People who say Requiem for a Dream is the most depressing and traumatizing movie have not seen Martyrs. 




 You could really say the same thing about any Marvel movie though. People can say what they want about Avatar's story, but it created an incredible and original world and universe. It's so incredibly detailed and well realized. More so than any movie had in a long long time, and more than any movie since.  




 I love Terrence Malick films but the problem is that he's only made a few and I've seen them all multiple times. 

What are some films that feel very inspired by his films? Not just in their themes but also in how they are shot and edited and how he does storytelling.  




 Avatar is still the most jaw dropping theater experience I've ever had. I'd give anything to see it in 3d imax again.  




 I dunno. I was thinking about it, and I'm not entirely sure it fits what I'm looking for. The thing about LNS, and I won't spoil anything, is that, while there *is* a character that isn't who they say they are, it doesn't really play on this. LNS doesn't really show you-know-who's character as a mysterious one, they just use flat out misdirection, which I don't think is the same thing.

The thing about the movies I used as examples, The Guest and Stoker, is that they don't misdirect you into believing the character's are something opposite of what they really are. Instead, they leave their backstories vague and almost breadcrumb-like hints about the true nature of their characters. In fact, right from the get go you feel something is off about the characters.

LNS, on the other hand, leaves you no hints to who the character really is, and I personally never felt like something was of about LNS's character. They don't ever give you a reason to not believe the character is who they say they are.

Now don't get me wrong, I think LNS is a fantastic movie and I love it. I also haven't seen it in a while, so I could be super wrong in all of this and might be overlooking some things that I have forgotten about it. However, I don't remember getting a "this person isn't who they say they are" vibe from LNS. 




 Yes, I've seen it and this definitely fits what I'm looking for! 




 I just watched The Guest and I really enjoyed the first half of it because it plays as a mystery. You're wondering who this guy *really* is, and you get a sense that the character is not who they say they are, and their background is kind of unclear whether it's true or not.

Another film I can thin of that kind of follows this is Stoker. In Stoker, you're not really sure who Matthew Goode's character *really* is, but there's something mysterious and off about him.

An interesting thing to note is that in both of these films, the mysterious character is a very charming and charismatic guy.

Are there any other movies that play around with the idea of someone not being who they say they are? Or where a character's true identity or back story is a mystery? 

I'd like to see more movies where there is a character who is mysterious, kind of off, and gives off an "I'm not who you think I am" kind of vibe.

Edit: I thought maybe it'd help if I clarify that I'm not looking for movies that just simply have a character that's not who you think they are, but movies that have a character that's not who you think they are and *the movie plays on this idea*. If that makes sense. 









 The Exterminating Angel has held up very well in my opinion.  




 Storyboarding will save you time and are so efficient. The best part is that you don't have to be a good artist. Since you are directing and operating the camera, you are really the only person who needs to be able to discern them.

Storyboarding will make shooting so much easier and organized. It's so nice to go into a shoot knowing exactly what shots you need. Too many times I've gone into shoots without a storyboard planning to just improvise and I end up wasting a lot of time standing around trying to figure out shots. You save so much time when you storyboard because when you're done with one shot, you just refer to your board and can immediately know where and how to set up your camera. 




 I'm gonna buy a house! 









 In this scene a man is standing in the wilderness at night. How do you light a scene like this on a micro budget? What's the best way to shoot it?

Also, a side question, what's the best way to capture a starry night on video?

I'll be using a Canon Rebel T3i, but I might rent a camera instead. 




 It's just a man asking people where someone is but the way it's shot makes you feel so uneasy. The camera is sideways throughout most of the sequence which leaves little room in the frame.  




 I'm super late to the party so no one will see this.

Inside. It's a French horror film. Very disturbing, but more so in terms of gore. It's definitely going for shock value in it's violence. Basically it's about a woman who breaks into another woman's house to steal her unborn baby. 




 Why? I haven't seen it in a long time and the only disturbing thing I remember from it is the dream sequence and even that wasn't *that* disturbing. 




 I love the hellish mood of it. It felt a lot like watching a nightmare. 




 Even if you end up not liking it, I think it's still a worthwhile experience because there is not another movie out there like it. Highly original and visually stunning. 




 Yeah, the nightclub scene, not just the fire extinguisher part, but the entire sequence, made me feel severely uncomfortable and claustrophobic as well as making me feel anxiety. 




 I feel like I'm missing something. I don't find the babadook to be a great horror film. I do think it is a great film all around, but it feels more like a psychological thriller mixed with a family drama.  




 I find it interesting that you'd hesitate to call The Cabin in the Woods a horror, whereas I'd hesitate to call the Babadook a horror.  




 The ending of the Matrix when Rage Against the Machine's "Wake Up" kicks in gets me so pumped.  




 Ditto 




 I do agree but I'm not great at articulating. Never have been. I worded it to the best of my abilities.  




 Like when a Wikipedia page is so interesting that it leads you to more and more links and Wikipedia pages 




 This sub is meant to be a bridge between /r/movies and /r/truefilm. I think my post, while not great, does fit here. I don't know if you were the one that downvoted my reply to you or not, but I feel it was unjustified. You asked me to be a bit more descriptive and I told you that I wasn't great at articulating and gave you two reasons why I didn't find it great. 

Then in reply you basically told me my post was bad and didn't belong here. I don't blame you for expecting higher quality posts, but that attitude is kind of why people are intimidated by /r/truefilm, and is why this sub was created. To be a more formal /r/movies and a more casual /r/truefilm.  




 I wouldn't say it's more /r/movies tier than most post on here. I posted this to get more of an understanding of what others thought of Goodfellas. 

It is entirely possible that Goodfellas was overhyped for me, and, in turn, I set myself up for disappointment. It's kind of hard for me to explain why it rubbed me the wrong way. I've never been great at articulating. I never said Goodfellas was bad. I do think it's a good movie. Above average and better than most movies. I just think that when compared to Scorsese's other work, Goodfellas hardly stands up. I know this isn't a great answer and not what you wanted to hear. 

Someone else said it earlier in this thread. They said that since I have seen Scorsese's recent work before I saw Goodfellas, it probably didn't seem like anything new or special. However, had I seen it when it came out, it would've been very fresh and interesting. I think this is entirely possible.  




 Great response! I also thought Wolf of Wall Street was disappointing. It felt like a parody of Scorsese films directed by Scorsese himself. It felt like one of the most self indulgent movies I've seen.  




 Scott has definitely made some great movies, but recently he's been like 85 percent bad and 15 percent good. Actually for last decade he's been like that. 




 I kind of just found it to be underwhelming. I didn't find it to be great like everyone keeps saying it is. Is it a good movie? Sure, but I don't think it's great and definitely don't think it's Scorsese's best.

Am I missing something? Is it actually an overhyped film? Can we talk about what it is about Goodfellas that sets it apart and makes it better than any of Scorsese's work? 




 I feel so weird because I think The Master is one of his worst. 




 I tend to enjoy them. It's interesting, movies are supposed to be a way of escapism. That's why I go see blockbusters. But there have been so many big budget movies in the last year or so, that I look forward to these small, hyper-realistic films. They're a nice break from all the blockbusters. An escape from escapism movies, if you will. 




  #sprangbreeeeaaaak 




 Triple Nine sounds great. Great cast and great director.

Everest is a great story with a great cast, but I'm worried about the director. Contraband and 2 Guns weren't great and this is the kind of story that needs a director that will do it justice. Although he did make an Oscar nominated film so there is still hope.

Is the Jungle Book going to be animated or live action? And will it be 3D or 2D animation? Do we know?

I had no idea the Coen brothers were writing a film for Steven Spielberg. That sounds pretty great.

The Martian is such a good book and I'm excited to see it, but I'm extremely worried since Ridley Scott is directing.

Never heard of The Revenant, but consider me excited. Interesting story and I love Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu.

Thanks for posting this, OP. I hadn't heard of some of these before so now I have new movies to look forward to! 




 Eh. I won't say it looks great, but Mann hasn't made a movie yet that I didn't at least enjoy, so I'll hold on to hope. 




 It's not, the article stated that the director is a first time director with Abrams producing.

Also, would Microsoft even allow Sony to produce a Halo movie? 









 Alternatively, what job/career is not as great as most people think it is? 




 That girl getting bullied was stone cold! She handled it so well. Those girls were trying to be intimidating and it was so satisfying watching her not buy into that empty intimidation. 




 I've never really had luck with finding steelbooks on Ebay. Almost everyone selling one thinks that their copy is so rare so they will list it for twice as much as you could get it from Zavvi. I just got a bunch of steelbooks on Zavvi. They were all in stock on zavvi, but when I checked Ebay, they were all more expensive there. 




 Yeah when it came out, but once it had been out for a couple of months people just sort of stopped talking about it. 




 So I don't now if it's actually not as good as I thought it was(I loved it), but I find it kind of strange that hardly anyone is talking about this movie. 




 Well, I mean, technically you can. It's called an identity rhyme. 




 I think Universal actually has plans to do more of these. 




 We asked my sister to take them and we picked out a couple that we liked. My sister told us that she didn't have any photo editing software and we don't know anyone who does.

We'd be happy to compensate for the work! Just enhancing and adjusting colors and lighting and touching them up to make them look really nice. We know nothing about photo editing! We'd appreciate any help!

I'm not super sure how this works, but if you PM me with some sort of estimate of the cost, that'd be great!

 Are they reliable? Are they legit? 




 I love slapstick and physical comedy. What are some comedies that are filled with this kind of humor? 




 That doesn't make it okay to have a shallow story or characters. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXhpePGZdPM list=UUrTNhL_yO3tPTdQ5XgmmWjA#t=617 




 Gravity had a shallow story with shallow characters. It lacked depth. Not saying that Interstellar was any better. I think both are equally bad when it comes to writing. 




 Right, because it totally didn't spell everything out and left stuff to the imagination. 

Was Gravity a visual masterpiece? Hell yeah. Was Gravity the definition of a visual story? Hell no. 

What little Gravity had to say about it's characters or story, it said through dialogue.  




 I agree. Yeah, they both take place in space, but Interstellar is a high concept sci-fi, whereas Gravity is more like a "can happen today" kind of story. Someone said Gravity wasn't science fiction, but was more like science non-fiction, and I think that's fitting. 




 I think there is nothing wrong with having a bare-bones, straight forward story, but Gravity's story, to me, felt more shallow than anything else. 




  Interstellar was more like Nolan flatly telling the audience the story in dialogue and skipping over all the working underneath.

Wait, so you're telling me it's bad that Interstellar did this, but it's okay that Gravity did it? 




 Interstellar didn't have the best writing, but there's no way Gravity's writing was any better.  




 I vote Logan Lerman as Danny 




 Can you think of movies like Whiplash? Where the main character has an idol or someone they look up to, then the person becomes the character's mentor and then the character finds out their idol isn't who they thought they were?  




 Thanks? 




 I was just trying to be humorous 




 What does that even mean? 




 I don't know. I added a question mark because it was supposed to be read like I was unsure. You know, like with the inflection of my voice getting higher as the sentence went on while raising my shoulders.  




 I was always under the impression that it was considered a classic? 




 I've always seen the Dark Knight as more of a crime movie than a super hero movie. Even though it's a Batman movie, it felt hyper realistic by super hero movie standards. Not that that's a bad thing.  




 So there is a local tv station that has an entry level production assistant job opening. The guy said to send in my resume as well as some of my sample work from when I did tv production before.

My question is, how do I attach samples of work I've done to my resume?  




 It's not quite a movie, though. It was from the 90s. It was a video where your face would be on the cartoon main character's body. You might have been riding a bull at some point? I don't know how it worked. I got it as a Christmas gift from my grandmother when I was like 6.

Any ideas? 









 Was just wondering how my radio knows what song is playing on a given station 




 I agree that Fincher's visual style would fit well. I don't know why what I said pissed a couple of people off, but I think Anderson is great at creating a tense atmosphere. Look at There Will Be Blood, it's not at all a scary movie, but it definitely felt unnerving and tense the whole time. Now imagine if he was actually trying to scare you. 

David Fincher is easily my favorite director working today, but I always thought his style was better suited for real world movies. Movies that are more grounded in reality. Which the same could be said for PTA, but I can see them both making a good Bioshock. 




 You should watch Death Wish with Kevin Bacon and also watch John Wick. Both of those feel like what a Max Payne movie should be. 




 Maybe directed by Paul Thomas Anderson? I feel like he could definitely pull off the atmosphere and style.

Edit:Sorry for my opinion? 




 I guess I was just really looking for a camera that "sees" well in amy lighting condition without loss of quality. Sort of how a human can perceive things well in incredibly low light situations and very bright situations.

And thank you for the response! It was very informative!  




 I'm kind of a newbie so I have a question.

What camera/camera settings/lens combination, in your experience, replicates the range of light and colors humans see with their eyes the closest?

Using only natural lighting, have you found a lens/camera combo that replicates what we see with our naked eyes? 




 So are there suits that have more flex than others? Something stretchy? I have a pair of pants that have spandex(?) woven into them so that they have some flex to them. I find these pants extremely comfortable. Are there full suits that have some stretch to them? Something that will give me a wider range of motion? 









 So I just saw John Wick and really liked it, but I was kind of distracted by the CGI blood. I'm a huge advocate for practical effects like actual squibs. However I totally understand the benefits of CGI blood like not having to clean up your set or actors or wardrobe when you reset a shot. So it logistically makes sense. And there are examples of good CGI of organic things like water. 

So why is CGI blood still kind of bad for the most part and are there any examples where the CGI blood and gore looked really good? 




 I don't think they're nitwits. Them not liking the movie isn't what bothers me. What bothers me is that they are so objective about it, yet only cite the story and structure without going into detail as the reason for it being bad. They refuse to have a discussion about it. I love discussing movies I love with people that don't like them! Of course all while being civil and respectful. 




 So I really love the Tree of Life and my friends don't. I'm fine with this. People like different things. This doesn't bother me. What bothers me is that they say it's a "shit movie" and it's "terrible". They don't say they *think* it's bad they will say "No, dude, Tree of Life is bad."

This didn't use to bother me because my friends are the kind of movie goes who would rather watch an action movie. Not that there is anything wrong with that. So I just chalked it up to the fact that it's just a very different movie than what they are used to.

But then my film friend, a guy I've known since high school and talk movies with all the time, recently watched it. I thought, "Finally, someone who appreciates all kinds of movies will watch this with me." We watch it and I'm like, "Now I know someone else who will like it and I can talk to him about it." But alas, he also tells me it's pretty terrible.

So this got me thinking, am I missing something? Again, it's totally fine that my friends don't like Tree of Life. What bugs me is that they will objectively say it's a bad film. So artistic stuff aside, is The Tree of Life *technically* a bad movie?

Their reasoning is that the story is bad and say it's too hard to follow. 

So now I'm genuinely curious, is it bad technically? Am I biased because of how the movie affected me emotionally? So much so to where I cannot view it objectively?

Edit: I just want to clarify that I'm not here to pander. I seriously want to discuss the technical aspects of this film and the structure of the story. 




 I might be interested in theater work whether it be on stage or behind the scenes. Where can I go for info on upcoming auditions and what not? 




 Paul Thomas Anderson doing a horror movie would be incredible. 




 Geeze, honestly, who fucking cares? There has been a lot of Mormon stuff on here lately for some reason, and every time there is all I have to say is "Who fucking cares?" This applies to all posts about religion. 




 I still think Shame is McQueen's best film. 




 I also find it frustrating when people just refuse to believe he has any talent. They just go, "Michael Bay? Total shit director." He's actually a damn fine director. The man can direct action like no other. Despite whatever opinions people have on the artistic value of Bad Boys II, I still think it's one of the best action movies from a directing standpoint. 




 Why? It's a giant Hollywood action/adventure epic. Did you expect them to cast racially accurate actors over actors with star power? 




 Everyone keeps talking about how great Tom Hardy was but no one is talking about how great matthias schoenaerts did! That dude is Belgian and English is not his first language and he did a fantastic job.
