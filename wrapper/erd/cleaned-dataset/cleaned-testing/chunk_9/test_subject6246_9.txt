 One night I was sitting in my couch when I saw my neighbor in his running clothes outside my window. I usually see him several times a week since he runs a lot and I spend a lot of my time in my couch. But this time something felt different. I realized something. That used to be me. I used to run a lot and I used to love it. Why don't I do that any more? 

It was almost like it wasn't a decision at all. I just downloaded the app and started doing it. Sometimes it felt hard. Sometimes i wanted to quit. Most times it just felt natural and right. Like remembering something you had forgotten for a long time. 

I'm finally a runner again. And now I'm on to new challenges. Keep working hard and be as awesome as I know you can be. Thanks for the support and inspiration! 









 I love this! Have been using something simliar on and off for the last couple of years. I always see better results on the scale when I'm actively logging my weight in my spreadsheet. Now I have a spreadsheet on google docs where me, my siblings, my husband and a friend regularly log our weight. It's really fun. Great for maintaining your weight to.  




 My favorite couple from The Walking dead (maybe kind of a spoiler for issue 79).
