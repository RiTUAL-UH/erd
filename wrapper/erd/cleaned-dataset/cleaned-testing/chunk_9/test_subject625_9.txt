 What do you guys do if you're trying to fall asleep during or shortly after your comedown? Should I take NyQuil or something? Thanks 




 Okay so I ended up getting the Logitech G600: http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g600-mmo-gaming-mouse

it's a good mouse, has a ton of buttons (A third button to the right of the right mouse clicker AND side buttons on the scroll wheel) plus custom LED's, the works. Not sure if I can handle it all though! I just tried last night and remapped all my hotkeys and it's a little overwhelming. Maybe I just have to get used to it? 




 If that's not a sign I don't know what is. 




 Me personally I don't mind clicking on the toolbar to use my potions if it means extra keys for attacks. 




 Those are going pretty cheap lately too, aren't they? Never thought I'd need that many buttons until now 




 Oh I'm currently using all of the hotkeys on my mouse, hence why I mentioned them aha I just need more 




 I don't know what it is, but this image seems off to me. The bags seem smaller. Anyone else see this? 




 I've been meaning to get a mouse with more keys but I haven't been playing many games that demanded more buttons lately. All that changed when I bought Grim Dawn during the Summer Sale. Right now I'm stuck with the basic keyboard hotkey setup and five extra buttons to use on my mouse. What's everyone else's setup like? Any mice recommendations? 




 Dude I thought I was the only one.

Not only do I not have the urge to talk, I'm just 200% chill. I can sit there in silence and just watch everyone around me and be fine. It's also a little difficult for me to speak when I'm high cause my voice gets all shaky and quiet. Not really nervous but you can tell I'm blazed. My friends don't get it, they're much rowdier than me. 




 Please update with the models present on the board! I'd love to see more of your work :D 




 This is ridiculously bad ass. Nice fucking work! 




 Just wanted to make sure this was a genuine strain, no BS. Thank you for the response though! 




 At the same time, r/ShroomID is just going to be filled with people asking for ID's and nobody answering because most of them aren't knowledgable.. Which is why they're there in the first place. 




 Okay, we can agree to disagree at least. I just think it's really silly that everyone's getting up in arms about sales that they're not entitled to is all 




 But it's not hard to realize that it has a slash through "$80". I think it's common sense that most people know new games are worth $59.99 so if they "accidentally" click on it then I mean really, how can you be that careless? Not you in specific but anyone who would get angry at such a thing. I don't think they were trying to trick anyone and be nefarious about the whole thing.  




 Bitching about a game because you can't refund it? Were you planning on playing and then getting your money back and you're made that they "foiled your plans"? 




 I think OP is just disguising his reasoning. Either way it's a little whiney. 




 "Your game wasn't on sale so take THAT! HMPH!"

Come ooooonnnnnn haha The game only came out a little bit ago anyway. Plenty of brand new games didn't get a sale. Not Rockstar's fault everyone's too cheap to pay full price for a game. You aren't entitled to a sale.
