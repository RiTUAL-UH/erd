 Best comment I have seen in a long time.. 




 I sometimes make slices with sweet potatoes as snacks. Cause I'm lazy and its to hot to use an oven, I just slice them and pop them into the microwave for about 8 mins and they're soft. For cruchiness, another 3 mins and flipping them over makes them a great snack. 




 On the upside, the walnuts are a great source of fats so... win-win? 




 Congrats! You look absolutely incredible, I've just started my journey to get fitter again after the exams season and your progress is so encouraging.

I'm 5'4 but I have the same goal weight too :) 




 Southern fried chicken, the batter in particular. I have no alternatives but will eat it maybe twice a year 




 There's a great podcast by Neil DeGrasse Tyson with Elon Musk called 'The Future of Humanity' where he discusses some of these issues and his opinions that I'd recommend. 




 'Force' this 'force' that for Chinese, 'learn' this 'teach' that in the West 




 Hear hear

Although I'm sure they exist, I for one have never had the interest in them 




 Yeah I get you, the whole British villian thing is super popular across all genres though 




 Congrats! 









 Drive- the visuals and soundtrack are incredible

Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs and most Tarantino for revenge/bloodshed 




 Dazed and confused all the way, The Breakfast Club to a certain extent too. 




 Inception, although most people I know are still confused 




 Yes!!! 




 Doesn't bother me either, I don't know why but I can completely block out what I know and still focus on the story. I do it with books too, Harry Potter is a great example of how I read it backwards. 




 I hated it at first too but I think its a film that requires repeated views to relate better. (Or maybe I relate better cause I'm the same age as them...) 




 Anna Kendrick, Jessica Chastain and most South Korean and Chinese actors and actresses 




 I think a lot of Disney is... I watched Aladdin the other day and realised that Jasmine was dressed as a harem girl even though she was a princess.

Theres a buzzfeed article on it [here](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/are-these-disney-movies-racist#.us9ld7RXR9) 




 I agree with what you're saying on The Secret Life of Walter Mitty too. For me, Drive: story line was poor but man, if you can watch it and completely tune out what they're saying and just listen to the music...

Sometime Wes Anderson's stuff, The Grand Budapest Hotel in particular. I found the story to be the blandest out of his work but the sheer attention to detail is overwhelming. I recently read an article about the set design and how the word 'patisserie' on Mendl's boxes was spelt wrong and Anderson picked up on it and had it corrected in post-production. 

Edit: perhaps not *disproportionately* good but John Wick had beautiful visuals and soundtrack too, especially considering the storyline 




 Was I the only one who found it to predictable and a disappointment? 




 I think this explains it pretty well, the neutral tones are often in characters with a   e.g. ,, and these are pronounced very short.

Try doing exercises with just the 'a' vowel like       .

I do find that most people struggle with the third tone, but its just a falling and rising tone and longer than the others. Try it out with different consonants and vowels to get a feel but  is probably one of the more difficult ones to do.
