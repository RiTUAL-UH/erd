 Should probably use a throwaway, but who gives a shit? A similar thing happened to me about a month ago, and a few months ago, but with a twist. This beautiful, amazing girl and I went on a few dates. Then she disappeared. I messaged her saying I understood if she didn't want to see me and that I would respect it, but she told me that she had depression and was into in pretty bad and she disappears when this happens to her. Then a couple months later we got together and dated for about a month and a half..then she disappeared. Long story short is that I think I scared her away by trying to see her to comfort her, and because she was my gf and I wanted to see her. Sorry this became a long story but it's making shit worse for me and I ended up venting it here. But to relate it to you, when things got better for this girl I dated she came back to me. Your friend will probably do the same. 




 Is it bad that I'm pretending that this is the girl who broke up with me like a month ago? Probably.
