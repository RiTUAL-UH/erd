 Oh man lesson learned. I guess you are right I may have scarred her because of my lack of sensitivity. The part that is confusing me though is that she told me she loves me and I am the one but she's hurt still. I don't understand what she wants me to do. 




 Sorry typo in title. Having issues with my girlfriend of seven months. 




 Ok so I've been dating this wonderful girl that is smart, gorgeous and everything I want in a partner. Our relationship started of with her going to college three hours away but I still made an effort to see her at least twice a month during weekends.

Our issues started during intercourse when I decided to be an asshole and get mad at her over her not being able to continue to give me my orgasm. I had been going for about thirty minutes and had given her a pretty decent time but I guess she couldn't handle it.
After she mad me stop immediately in the middle of sex she told me that it felt great and I responded with yea for you because you got your pleasure. 

I know this was fucked and uncalled for but it was my dick talking honestly I was just caught up in the moment. Ever since this I have tried so hard to make it up to her and it's been three months and she still brings it up. I don't think she is capable of forgiving me and it's making us fall apart. 

She has been working a lot this Summer to the point were we don't see each other at all and the last time I saw her she told me she had a thing for a guy she knows at work because I drove her away and she feels the only way she can feel better is to do something to hurt me back.

I honestly don't understand her. I really do love her and did plan on marrying her. She knows that cheating on me is the one thing I won't take her back for so I don't know if she's testing my love for her in a sick twisted way or she is just scarred because of what I did?

TL;DR Told my gf she sucked at sex, now she hates me but loves me and wants to have a summer fling with another guy to get back at me. 




 Wish I could find a girl like that. My girlfriend is like you lol always busy with other things. 




 Wow what an introvert. 




 reddit makes me money, while it is just a waste of time for you and maybe a sad fap.
