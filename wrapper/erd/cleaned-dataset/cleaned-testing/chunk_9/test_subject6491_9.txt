 Since it's /r/writing and not /r/books it makes sense. OP wants to read the craft and less the plot. 




 How to claim your content with this one simple trick. 





























 Yeah. It used to be terrific blog when it was just Barry's little project with the crappy default design and LOTS of quality articles. It really shined during the previous cycle. Even today, when I research some topics I google this blog for material. The majority of the usable results I get is from 3-4 years ago and backwards.  









 I would start comparing Swift to Apple when she'll be a multi billion dollar company with $200 BILLION cash reserved.  




 Not everything is measured directly by money-per-episode. There's also reputation, brand name, keeping things fresh, trying to end shows at their pick and making room for something new. 




 That would be too *e**a**sy*. 




 Why not just. 




 Mostly caught up. There are some threads and plots that aren't in the show, so that might be for future seasons. Overall, the faith of the main characters matches the books with few minor exceptions.  














 Also, a player scores 40 points and his average gets lower as a result.  




 He's fading, as they say.  




 Yeah, I wasn't referring directly to you. I noticed it's straight from the article (can we even call it like that?). However, since /r/television doesn't have "matching title" rule, a little editing would be in place: *Kemper delyed by TSA for carring some fruits.* 




 It's hard to compare. Hopkins plays for a very short time, most of it in a cell. So he makes a damn strong impression with limited time and space. He must be much less subtle. Also, tropes that seem today as cliches (the intelligent psychopath killer) weren't that way when SofL was made.  




 What a terrible click bait title. 



















 It's funny, because digital sales should be the easiest to track. 



















 Fading. 




 "I'm gay"

"You're gay?"

"Hey, that's derogatory!" 









 This is some Monty Python level writing. 









 For classic sci-fi you can go with Asimov's Robot's series. It's also great for trips, because each book is a collection of short stories. 

So to start, here are links to the first 5:

 Everything was bad news for legs. Seriously, fuck legs. duopoly, zero competition, same version for years. I charge them for 8 hours, then I can use them for what? 2-3 hours and then I have to charge again. And the speed just decreases over the years, no original parts to change, no warranty.  




 Using Adobe Lightroom, what's your workflow? what are the essentials post you are doing? for me it's mostly adding just a bit of Clarity, Vibrance and medium contrast Tone Curve. Just wondering if others have "go to" adjustments.  



















 What are you talking about? This is prime time television, not public education or ballet. It's a product, and a very successful one. Why wouldn't the market work here? Dozens of new shows are made every season, from both side of the spectrum, very cheap and very expensive. 




 That's like saying red cars take up spots for black cars. There's enough place on the road and more than enough air time with hundreds of channels. If there's a market for your kind of show (you know, the 'real' entertaining ones) someone will make it. 









 Yeah, it's like: oh, someone kills few people over chickens - good, fun action. Someone's having sex with his wife on their wedding day, which isn't even rape in the book's universe - wow, broken and bent, I can't even. (and to fair, not even rape in our universe. If Sansa made a complaint for rough sex in her wedding night, it won't even make it to court)

 They assumed it's for ~~normal~~ white people. Known to be a lazy race since 50,000 BC. 




 Will it punch everyone equally? 




 I would download a tractor. 




 My PC goes to sleep after 30 minutes. I'm going to configure my future auto car the same way. 




 Well, opposite sex appreciates and that's all that matter. When humans appreciate something they also tend to be exploitive. 



















 Okay, time to watch the extended edition yet again. Real world, see you in 12 hours. 




 The site is beautiful, fast, and works as advertised. [Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/361a71/hi_reddit_i_built_an_image_search_engine_that/). 














 I'm glad to hear (ha ha) about the fully voiced characters. As much as I loved and played the game, lack of voices broke the immersion for me. With that and the new quests with fresh ending, I'll definitely give it another go. 




 So you are saying the hair also disappointed of him. 









 Thanks. Sad news for me. 









 Short and safe answer: yes. The important ones (email, bank, facebook, paypal, credit card, utilities websites, windows, etc - any password that leads to an account with real life information).

Edit: I just want to state how a good firewall is important. Lots of anti-virus, anti-malware will identify the keylogger, but they have lots of false positives. However, when a firewall prompts that a process wants access to outside world (send or receive), there should be a real good reason to allow it. Even if it's a legit program, 95% of them don't need (or shouldn't need) internet access to work properly. I can count on my hand the number of programs on my pc that get internet access. 

So in this case, even is the keylogger worked, it won't be able to send the data out. 




 Easily one of the best trailers I have seen in the past few years. 




 Last I heard was that Bradley won't return as Ronnie Brooks, which is a bummer. Does anybody know if more episodes are planned and when? I really like this adaptation, and my only complain is that they stick too much to the original scripts (And as a L O fan, means I pretty much know all the plot after the opening scene. Still liked it plenty though).
 




 You can try Hola (with Chrome) and BBC's iPlayer.  



















 Most of the stuff is like final assignment for design graduates. If you do like this kind of stuff, check [Yanko Design](http://www.yankodesign.com). Lots of designers submit photoshop mockups of products.  
























 I would actually support a 4 point line between the arc and mid court. Makes the game more interesting, what's not to like. 




 I tried to slide the second image. Why do I always fall for that? 




 I get it, nobody likes it when "his" term of identity is "stolen" and mis-used, but language, economy and social habits are all living things, they change and evolve over time. 

The word "socialism" isn't what it used to mean, and it means differently in different part of the world. So it changes through time and space. 

So don't be the guy, that when someone calls him "the guy" (like I just did) says in reply "actually, did you know that **guy** comes from the name of Guy Fawkes and it used to mean effigy, and I just hate it when people use it differently." 




 You want to tell me that some people think 35 minutes of mounted travel is SHORT? 




 On a blind test, you'll swear it's an ice cream. 









 Magic wasn't a scorer. 




 Where you leave, do politicians have immunity for murder? Can they buy M1 Abrams tanks for personal use with tax payer money? how come they can't? who's enacting those law? 

So to me, if I were a person who's okay with *The System*, I would simply point out that the same laws and regulations that prevent them from murdering and buying tanks should be extended to hookers and drugs. 

Most people think *The System* works, and any flaw can be fixed within *The System*. The flaws that can't be 100% fixed are tolerable and are justifiable cost to keep *The System* running.

Now, I'm not saying they are right or wrong, but I don't see how simply pointing out something that be fixed by law is going to convince anybody.  




 If you want a cool variation without icecream (dairy free), try frozen banana and coconut cream as a base. It works great. Make sure to peel, slice before freezing the banana. 

To that you can add any fruit (like frozen strawberries, blueberries) or cocoa poweder or cookies or peanut butter.

For refreshing taste, try mint and vanilla.

If it's too thick (but then, how can a milkshake be too thick) add coconut milk. 




 Excellent. I saved it in my notes. 




 That's his 2nd worst year with TO. I think it's because he has to carry the ball more and make more plays for the team. Irving is a great point guard, but I guess his injuries impact that as well.  




 The first half was like watching an 8th grader sneaking into 3rd grader game.  




 Probably divorced and make them go with shirts like: MO|AD and DA|OM. 




  The good news is nigga you came a long way  
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way

-- J. Cole 




 You can see how he started to time from half court. Basically looked at Rose and didn't run until Rose was past him. 




 You are on point. We like candidates with teen spirit and adult temper. They usually don't go hand in hand. Paul got the first but lack experience (though he's getting there). Clinton acts professionally but lack substance. Obama, the 2008 candidate, had a lot of the first, and enough of the second. 

That's why Sanders excites the liberal base, because he's got both (not that he has a chance of winning, but that's for other reasons, just don't tell that to Reddit).  




 Home got to it. 




 They are both patients in a mental hospital. He just doesn't know it. 




 As real as this story mate (that's 100% if you haven't been following). 




 Why? are you saying people don't have the right to exercise 2nd amendment right? what's triggering you in this story? oh, I get it, the stray dog. That would be animal control, not CPS. 




 Oh man, you have no idea. I just happened to press F1 in another program to open the help file, and I had to watch Notepad opens and populated with thousands of Fizz Buzz. I felt trolled so hard. 




 I don't know. Whoever convicted those guys I guess:
[List of American state and local politicians convicted of crimes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_state_and_local_politicians_convicted_of_crimes). 




  I never heard an answer that convinced my opponent himself

Seriously? how about: "let's throw that politician in jail and outlaw hookers and blow." Sounds like a typical liberal answer.

The concept of taxes is accepted by most people and also by many libertarians. so I don't see how giving an example of one particular wasted taxes is going to change anyone's mind. 

Everybody knows that taxes aren't 100% effective. But all the people who accept the tax concept (which is the majority of people, right after they stop bitching about it) just argue on the amount and how to spend it. 




 I just ran it fine with 10,000 iterations. I would guess it's maybe some kind of memory limitation? 

Edit: looks like mine breaks at 15K, then I'm getting garbage. I think you find the ultimate shitty program :) 




  Forwards from Grandma are literally from the wrong generation.  




 It won't be a season finale without Daenerys in the final scene.  




 I watched the show since the closed beta of the machine.  














 If you've got dropbox preloaded on your S5, just activate it and login. You should get +48GB free for 2 years. I already had 12, so now I'm at 60.  




 James damn earned it. He's probably the number 1 play maker in the league (shoot, enter or pass and great court vision). 




 I just got a new phone, so here are the apps I first installed (my essential list):

* Bacon Reader (reddit)
* Calendar (I use Google's)
* Drive   Dropbox (Dropbox gives you +48GB free storage, which is great)
* ES Explorer
* Evernote
* LastPass
* Media Monkey   Poweramp (music)
* Waze
* Whatsapp
* Yaste (XBMC/Kodi remote)
* My bank app

 Okay, you win this round. 




 20 years ago faggots wouldn't be allowed to complain about lack of serious tag.  














 Then: oh, Expanded Consciousness, probably some good shit in it, I should spend an hour to explore it.

Now: oh, Expanded Consciousness, I hope they dumb it down to gallery format, I've got 2 minutes to spare. 




  traditionally and historically

Historically I was an ape. How about we'll focus on the present now? 




  haven't done my surgery rotation yet so I don't fully know this answer

Well, OP also hasn't done her surgery rotation and she sure has a lot more confidence talking about this stuff than you, so I guess I'm gonna take her word for it. Nice try thin patriarchy. 




 Putting the Wild in Buffalo Wild Wings. 




 1 million more republicans voted for Romney than those voted for McCain. They didn't stay at home at all. If anything, Democrats stayed at home in 2012 compared to 2008. 




 I love how he does couple of flips, pause for half a millisecond and then goes: yeah what the hell, I'll do another one, I've got so much time before landing. 




 Booing from the crowd every time he holds the ball is uncalled for. 

I hate lots of players (Kobe Shaq who dominated us for 5 miserable years, Noah, Dirk and the entire Dallas team, McGrady, Carter Kidd, Artest), but that's part of the game. I wouldn't boo them for just playing ball and I really wish them best of luck (when they play against other teams, of course).  




 and a scholar.  




  Cell phone companies are trading thinness for battery size

No. Cellphone companies are trading electronics for money. They compromise battery size because they know the majority of people prefer good bright large colorful screen, fast device, big RAM, storage, good sound quality, reliable fast connecting GPS and reliable networking. All those greatly consume battery life. 

If you don't care about thick device, some popular cellphones have [battery cases](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dmobile tag=hotoge-20 field-keywords=battery+case rh=n%3A2335752011%2Ck%3Abattery+case).

 If you care for her, make sure she's got a proper phone charger. 




 It's weird because not wanting kids is a somewhat a deep decision that isn't reached lightly. It involves different stages of life, your spouse, sometimes parents and it also affects you financially and socially for many years...

... and /r/childfree sometimes downplays it to kids screaming for 10 minutes in a movie based on a comic book.  




 That's probably true for all years, except 2001. 









 The bike? It's custom made with Carrera's frame and XTR - [picture here](http://i.imgur.com/GZd8z8B.jpg). The only downside to me (and the reason probably for a relatively cheap price) is 26 wheels, but I can live with that. 




 I'm ashamed to admit that I stopped reading 75% through with no good reason, because I did enjoy the book. Good chance to go back and finish it. 




 Amazon has a sale on [RAVPower Element RP-PB07 10400mAh Portable Charger](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009V5X1CE/). $16 for the 10,400mAh model (with promo code P3FFG8XA). Or the bigger model: RAVPower Deluxe 13,000mAh External Charger ($24), Promo code ZMF24RGT.

That's a good deal. 




 The Following - how is this still a thing? 




 Yeah, same here. With $1500 budget I got high-end second hand hard tail, all Carbon, 9-kg/20-pounds bikes. A real beast. 

I don't do technical rides, I prefer long marathon/endurance rides (50-75 miles) on mostly wide trails. So the bike fits me perfectly.  




  An artist is a person, before all else, and people often hold beliefs

Exactly. Even if she '"caved" in direct response to pressure' as OP wrote, that's fine, and by no means should be interpreted as a negative thing. Different people reacts differently to pressure, and she has every right to avoid difficult situations (if we assume it's a reaction and not political statement, which she obviously entitled to).

Hell, I know people that don't go to work because they have a little headache in the morning and they don't feel like standing in traffic, so why should be surprised when artists decide to dodge when a century old conflict knocks on their door.
 









 We should vote for people with real life experience, like Brian Roberts. 




 To answer seriously for a second, 'rape culture' means the socio-cultural environment encourages rape, or at least does nothing to prevent it, meaning, rape is seen as a normal act. 

I can tell this is true, because I wear suit and tie to meet clients. I'm literary raped by having to do that. Who's making me, you ask? Nobody, I'm self employed. This is how fucked and serious rape culture has become. I'm raping myself because it's what society expects of me. 




 I'm not sure what are you talking about. Create a shortcut called "Sound Playback" with the following target:

    C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL mmsys.cpl,,0

Create ahk script that runs it:

    Run, Sound Playback.lnk

Activate the window:

    Sleep, 100
    WinWait, Sound, 
    IfWinNotActive, Sound, , WinActivate, Sound, 
    WinWaitActive, Sound, 

use arrows to select the BT device (let's assume it's 3rd on the list)

    Send, {DOWN}{DOWN}

Hit context menu, and choose disable/enable

    Send, {APPSKEY}{DOWN}{DOWN}{ENTER}

I'm sure with 10 minutes tweaking and testing this can easily be done.



 




 You are talking about 3000 years ago, so I think it's worth mentioning that according to Jewish law, 13 is the adult age, in which a boy  becomes accountable for their actions (12 for girls). The ritual is called Bar Mitzva. Part of the ritual is the father, thanking God that he's no longer responsible for his son's actions. http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2473-bar-mizwah 




 You can probably create AHK script to do that, so you'll just need to assign it to a keyboard or desktop shortcut. 




 Twist: there are 50 pills in that box and 1 mint. The girl likes to take a chance. 




 Dude, no preview spoilers. 




 You are not a real man! the proper way of doing that is monitoring your female teacher behavior. If one of them acts irrationally, offer her a tampon and tell her she doesn't even have to thank you.  




 OKAY! I'm going to craft a statue to prove you wrong! Step one: where can I download some stone and some tutorial ebooks? 









 I think his point is against the whole argument of: if something small and usually not that meaningful happens you can say goodbye to huge phenomena, that probably not single event can affect.

To say thay Clinton is a bad candidate is one thing, but to think that her election will make any dent in gender equality, for better or for worse, is a bit out of touch from reality and how social changes shape.

 There's nothing more simple than using Dropbox of Google Drive. another HUGE advantage is that both services keep old versions of your files. So if your file is suddenly corrupted (drive or software failure) or even if you accidentally deleted something, saved and regretted it - they'll have previous versions to download. It's a life saving.

 [ Kendrick Lamar - i](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aShfolR6w8) - love yourself this summer.

In Baltimor, summer started early:

They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street  
And a gun in the hood and a mob of police  
And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends  
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme, yup  
These days of frustration keep y'all on tucking rotation  
I duck these gold faces, post up fee-fi-fo-fum bases  
Dreams of realities peace  
Blow steam in the face of the beast  
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now  
The strong in me, I still smile  

 I love myself  
(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs)  
I love myself  
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)  
I love myself  
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)  
I love myself  
(One day at the time, sun gone shine)

 Just watched Real Time and one of the guests, Dan Senor, made that comment in the title (I didn't verify it). "We are pouring tons of money into places like Baltimore. Input isn't the problem, the output is a disaster." Bad and totally ineffective government spending. 




 Absolutely. If you can love a dog, feed him and put a roof over his head - get one. It's a win win situation. Dogs are very adaptive to their owner habits. If you leave early and get home late, the dog will get used it and probably sleep comfortably the whole time.

Edit: lots of people are saying that this isn't healthy, and I agree that it's not ideal. However, I replied to someone who compared adopting a dog to a dog living in a cage. This is far better life. And yes, you got to compensate for the time you are missing:

* wake up earlier to take the dog for a walk. If you can go on an early jog, that would be great. The dog will love it. it shouldn't even be a long jog, 2 miles is a good distance for a dog. [check this chart please](http://www.runnersworld.com/sites/default/files/dogs500.jpg).
* take long walks with him at night, if it's a big dog that can run the distance (see chart above), consider using a bicycle.
* whenever you have a day off, take the dog with you, stop at the beach or at the park. 
* those are good ideas not only for the dog, but for you as well.
* consider getting a walker. Depends on where you live, those shouldn't cost much. If you can't find one, you can also talk to a kid in your neighborhood that will take the dog out after school for few bucks.

Anyway, while I hear lots of those comments and agree with them, remember that the most important thing you can for a dog is to love him, show your affection, communicate with him, feed him properly and have fun with him while you are around. so if you are busy, it might not be 100% ideal, but not everything in life is. This is still better than a dog sitting in a cage in some shelter where he feels like nobody.

 As other have explained, it's a matter of percentage within population. 

There's also another (unmeasurable) issue: how much of it justifiable? I'm not talking just about the final kill, but life events. For example, if [white kids are more likely to sell drugs, but black kids are more likely to go to prison for drug charges](http://www.csdp.org/publicservice/kids.htm), then black kids are more likely to grow up as criminals and have future trouble with the law. 

So even if all police harassment is race-blind, there are still underlying issues that increases the chances of black people to be involved in such incidents. 

 




 It's like a typical dialog in a movie: "let's go out to a dinner tonight, I'll pick you up" - "sure" - both hang up. STOP, THEY DIDN'T SAY THE TIME! ^THEY ^ALSO ^NEVER ^SAY ^BYE! 




 Tru Fakt (I cannot make this shit up): most superheroes die of HIV or Heroin OD. Also, there's a steep decline in straight superheroes saving straight dudes. 




 It's not an original quote -- Michael Scott. 




 For every ingredient in the first row you can match any ingredient in the second row, so that's 5\*5 = 25 meals. For each one of those 25 meals you can add another variant from the 3rd row, so 25\*5 = 125 combos by the 3rd row, and so on. That's 5^5 = 3,125 meals 




 And [here's another variation](http://eattillyoubleed.com/2015/04/moroccan-preserved-lemons/) that was posted recently in /r/Cooking I think.

 And Nelson Mandela, contrary to popular belief, hated dildos.  














 I was talking about economic policies, was I wrong in any of the examples I gave? And yes, republicans as whole are also far from libertarianism. I mean, Rand Paul is probably the closest viable candidate, and he's polling what? [not very strong even in its own base](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rand-paul-is-losing-his-fathers-base/). 




  what's wrong with requiring an ID to vote

There's nothing wrong with ID all by itself. However, in the current social environment and ID issues, lack of ID targets very specific demographics. 

If, let's say, there's a major move to provide everyone with ID ([like many other countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_identity_card_policies_by_country#Countries_with_compulsory_identity_cards)), then it would be reasonable to force ID when voting after a grace period of few years. 




   I consider myself a libertarian but I don't see much distance

Well, his economic views are as far from libertarianism as possible. 

I mean he's mostly against free trade, pro minimum wage, pro workers rights by law, heavy wallstreet regulation, etc. and there's the government intervention/stimulation angle which most Libertarian economists are against.

I'm don't mean to phrase them as bad policies, that's up to debate. But overall, don't expect much love at /r/Libertarian. 




 I meant as a core. Obviously some of running gags will aim at younger audience (those following him) and some will aim at older audience (those staying at that slot). 

Anyway, he might surprise, who knows. The last attempt to shake things a bit was by Conan at NBC and it didn't work well, they didn't have the patience. It's an expensive slot.  




 loyal3 is a broker that allows buying partial shares? if so, it's a bit different, because it's a virtual holding. You probably trade those shares with the broker and not with the exchange.
