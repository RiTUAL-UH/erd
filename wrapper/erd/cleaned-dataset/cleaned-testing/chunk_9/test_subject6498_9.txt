 I'm from Sweden. Shall I participate? My friends and family won't care. But you might be able to use something like this:

 **"**I've been enjoying free healthcare all my life. Free for me because my parents already payed for it through their taxes. I think this is your big chance to get the same. Why? It's simple really. Because Bernie Sanders never took any money from billionairs, banks, or the pharmaceutical industry**"**

she-who-must-not-be-named (great one) took hundreds of thousands from pharmaceutical companies.

(needless to say this idea is frickin' awesome)

edit: wow. It comes across like I'm giving myself a big pat on the shoulder on that last line. I mean OP's idea. Of course.  




 TIL (not american) 




 I never did. But I know I should do it. And oh. That condition I mentioned doesn't apply to this thread. ;) 




 I remember telling someone in a lucid dream I was dreaming as well. Don't think I got a response.

One of my lucid dream once though, and I think it was my first one. And didn't understand what it was. Was [Re-he-he-he-heaaly](https://youtu.be/D2MPoqqzwdY) weird

But it basically was that everything I didn't want to happen. Happend.

I got aware of this fact in this dream, and turned it around. "Faking I didn't want something to happen that I really did want. And it worked. I got some time with that and just "fake feared" a lot of good stuff and that was it.

I guess this is a really good post for this thread that I didn't think of before.. lol. 




 Aaww. You make me feel all patriotic.
But don't tell that to the Swedes. In Sweden, patriotism is heavily associated with racism for some reason.
 




 lol. Thanks for that. Really helpful considering I'm almost always sleeping on my stomach with my hands under the pillow.

Also. How do you remember to do that reality check? Do you try to focus on something in the distance also when you are awake? Maybe in your job?
I think most devices are scams though. 
 




 I don't think you shouldn't build rockets in a game that for *that* long...

 Wet eyes after 4 paragraphs... And that's an understatement. 




 Be glad it was not Bob. holy shit now I'm afraid of going to bed for just thinking of him.. 




 You there. YOU. How often do you get lucid? And how long did it take before you were able to do it quite often?
I have had maybe five lucid dreams in my life. 1 of them in my adult life. 




 I'd like to know what super calm mean in this case. If it's just calm. Sounds frickin' awesome. 




 Hopefully* 

Hopefully a socialworker of some sort. 




 I was like 7. Maybe 8. (around 2000)

One night when I was gonna watch go turn on the TV (probably a recorded pokmon episode or something) I remember being more afraid of the dark than usual. 
As I walk up to it to start it, I get this irrational fear of a growling bear or dinosaur. Or something. When I turn on the TV. There is a growling bear/dinosaur/whatever animal I was imagining right there growling. 

I ran down as fast as I could. And I still remember it to this day.

**tl;dr: One time I predicted what was gonna be shown on the TV before I turned it on**

I'm not lying, and I would want and explanation. 




 Sure, but DNA tests are like mega expensive if I'm not mistaken. And there are a lot of less weird and sneaky ways of getting ones DNA. 




 Seems like a great last class before the new chalk boards went up: "Let's draw some awesome stuff on here before we put the new boards up. Someone will find them when they take them all down"

We will probably never know.

 I'd pay to see that. But I probably don't have too. You got any good links? 




 No, but it has been posted here before. I'm not complaining. The new people here need to see it. 









 Well. I know some cool religious people to, but some are just. Well. 




 Yeah. If it's good shit, you should upvote. Many people will not have seen it. Especially considering how many new subscribers this sub always get. almost 10 000 in a month? 




 Yes. Never heard of him until I saw this but he seems like a straight up dude.

I wonder when we will get this kind of talk on Fox. ;) 




 Agnostic (edit: apparently just agnostic) here. (Swedish, and we don't like to take sides until we know for sure who's winning). And I agree. Whoever Christ was, be it just a really great guy or the son of god. No one can argue he was a fellow you would probably want to be friends with. 




 I wonder, what are the most severe safety risks when making an app to share your location with your friends. You wouldn't want some outsider to be able to get through and track you.

Not saving any location data more than temporary on the local device.

 Yes, but there are no Nato missiles in Sweden, that's the whole point of this threat. They don't want any closer borders with Nato heavy weapons.

 Jag hller med dig om att frverkliga skatter som inte drabbar gemene man utan endast de otroligt frmgna. (Jag vet inte vart grnsen gr mellan frmgen och otroligt frmgen) 

Men lt oss sga 200 miljoner kronor.

Och som du sger r det ltt att undvika skatterna fr de som har resurserna. Kamprad har vl inte betalat ngon skatt sedan 1982 skulle jag tro.

Men att det mste gras r klart tycker jag. Det finns ingen sim behver miljarder kronor i personliga tillgngar. Men att det finns mnga som har det r sjlvklart. Och att de vill behlla allt r egentligen inte deras fel. Det r inprntat i vra gener efter miljoner rs selektivt urval fr att man ska vilja bra med sig s mycket mat hem man bara kan. Vra gener r vr vrsta fiende.

Kanske r det EU som borde ta tag i detta. Men den chansen r inte direkt stor.. 




 Antagligen togs den bort fr att nn svinrik snubbe brjar bli gammal..

Arvsskatten r nog den enda som kan komma att pverka mig, men nog fan ska den finnas. Staten ska ha sin bit av kakan nr ngon fr pengar fr ngot en annan jobbat fr. 




 Now this is journalism.

How Russia can continue do deny after this is beyond me. There are so much proof. 




 I'll be a little shocked if you want. But I'm not. 




 Sadly they are doing their job perfectly if you watch their job description.. Which probably is to try and quiet down everything about how well he's doing. While making fun of his hair. 




 Jag r uppenbarligen ingen expert. Du kan inte krva av mig att jag ska komma upp med frslagen. Det r ngot folk med 8rig utbildning i mnet ska ta fram frslag p. Men vad sgs om kapitalvinster fr privatpersoner ver en viss grns, hgre moms p lyxfreml av olika slag, fastighetsskatt ver ett visst vrde. Jag r som sagt ingen ekonom men det r inte srskilt svrt att gra det om man vl vill.

Men hej. Vad sgs om att gra det lite dyrare att anstlla unga igen. Det funkar ju ocks. 




 *"Konfiskeras"*. Du behver inte ta i s du spricker min mn.

Istllet fr att hja arbetsgivaravgifter och elskatt kan man kanske istllet hja frmgenhetsskatten med 3% p alla som har mer n 2 Miljarder kronor i personliga tillgngar?

Eller tror du att man skulle sakna ngra miljoner om man hade s mycket pengar? 

**Vad gller bankerna.** S verkar du ha ftt allt om bakfoten. Bankerna kraschade fr att Clinton (Den amerikanska staten som du sger) lt sl ihop de kommersiella bankerna som ger ut ln, med investmentbanker som handlar med kapital p bl.a aktiemarknaden. (**Och detta gjorde han fr att han ftt massor med donationer frn bankerna fr att gra just detta**). Inte fan r politiker s dumma att de gr det med vilja. De hade massor med ptryckningar frn marknaden att gra just detta. Och stoppar man tillrckligt med pengar i kampanjfinansiering t politiker i USA s kan man f dem att lgga en rst i ett lagfrslag som gynnar dig. S r det bara.

Bank A brjar lna pengar av Bank B fr att investera i marknaden, sedan lnar Bank B pengar av Bank C fr att investera i marknaden. 

SEN. brjar det roliga. Bank A lnar pengar av Bank C fr att kunna betala tillbaka lnet till bank C och Bank B som d fr in lite pengar investerar vidare. Detta fortstter och 2008 hnde det som mnga ekonomer skrek sina halsar rda ver i nstan 10 r utan att ngon lyssnade. 

HELA SYSTEMET FLL. Och de tog halva Europa med sig.

Du kan inte sga att det r var personers ln utan kreditvrdighet som orsakade kraschen. Det var bankernas vrdslshet och girghet som orsakade den och inget annat. 




 Den funkade. Nej jag har aldrig beskt den trden. Verkar ha skrivit en del vettigt i det inlgget dock.. Mycket stmmer.

Min inspiration kommer frn att jag hnger mycket /r/SandersForPresident fr att jag tror att det r USAs enda chans att komma p ftter. Han har aldrig ngonsin tagit stora pengar, aldrig krt en attackreklam vid val och det frsta han ska gra om han blir vald r att f ut pengarna ur politiken.. (Han motstter sig ocks stora handelsavtal mellan USA och Asien som bara finns fr att det ska bli billigare att importera varor tillverkade av 10ringar..)

Hillary Clinton har ndrat nstan allt hon har att sga fr att matcha honom. Han har ftt ett enormt genomslag p bara en och en halv mnad sedan han utannonserade att han skulle delta i valet.

[Ta en titt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtBVuye4fZQ)

Tog en titt p budgeten, lste ngra PDFer som Regeringen slppt och vips s kan man f en uppfattning om vart vrt eget land r p vg. Arbetarpartiet hjer avgifter fr arbetare och hjer elskatt fr arbetande mnniskor. Medan man lter totalt 1 500 miljarder kronor som de allra rikaste har tillsammans ligga kvar orrt. 




 He's doing it to get his brand out there. The Young Turks made a great video about it (damn I'm glad I found those guys) Unbiased reporters that are articulate are hard for find.

[You can watch the explanation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdgq6ZD4I3Q)

 




 Missfrst mig inte. Han har en bra bit att g mot jtten Clinton. Men han har gjort bra ifrn sig (frvnande bra p en och en halv mnad). Srskilt i New Hampshire, Iowa vilket r de tv viktigaste staterna eftersom det r val dr frst. 

Amerikansk media tystar och vill inte prata om honom. Vilket inte r s konstigt eftersom han dessutom sagt att mediekoncernen som ger alla stora nyhetskanal r fel, och han vill bryta upp dem...  men bakom lyckta drrar r Hillary Clinton livrdd. Hon har ndrat alla sina policys till samma som Sanders. Det borde sga en hel del kan man tycka?  




 Jag hller med dig. Men inte sg vi ngon hjning p kolen eller oljan som r ca 25%.

Jag har inte satt mig in i det s mycket men jag tror att det r vattenfall som ligger bakom.. Och miljpartiet.. Vilka jvla mesar.

 Don't downvote the poor fellow. He don't know what a real feminist is. He only knows about the feminazis, and those will scream their lungs out at you trying to get their ungrounded arguments out. .. A real feminist is a person who thinks everyone is equal, regardless of gender.  




 UK has some really weird laws when it comes to sex. 




 Regrettably those are the ones who scream the loudest.. That sounded wrong. But you get the point.  




 . That's a word. Means "river" 




 G hem till /r/sweden med din skit 




 Det r min uppfattning. Mestadels extremister av ngot slag. Krnkraftslskare, krnkraftshatare, Sverigedemokrater och sociala rttvisekrigare..  




 Well, just about every Scandinavian will speak decent to very good English. And I'm studying and really don't know very much about politics if I'm to be sincere. I can read up on stuff when I'm getting into it, but it feels like bernie needs a pro. 
Thank you though. We Swedes love to be complemented on our English.  




 That new Patriot Park outside of Moscow? That is not made to grow the patriots of the country then?

 It's a publicly traded company. All they will EVER care about is showing a great profil for their shareholders. Every quarter.

 Tror det gller din umgngeskrets lika mycket som alla andra umgngeskretsar i hela vrlden. Jmlikhet fr alla my ass. 




 They think they have to choose between a rock and a hard place.

We have the power people. Because they rely on our payments. 




 I will not. But I will tell you. It's not getting any better for us. They announced the budget yesterday and no mention of higher taxes for wealthy..

Considering we have IKEA not having payed any taxes since I don't know when. The owner is worth about 61 Billion dollars..

Well. At least he don't make his money from oil. But it's still a shame. Also H M clothes use child labour in Bangladesh. And payed a total of about 60 dollars of taxes to Bangladesh a couple of years ago.. Pretty much two pair of pants.


So we have our own fair share of greedy billionairs.  




 The fact that they want to raise subscription when they are clearly getting more and more users. No one is commenting on that...

We shouldn't have to choose between higher pay or ads. They just want to pocket more money.. 




 Thanks for the response. I guess forming rules that are not to broad is really hard.

The speech from Marshalltown was maybe the best one yet. He really put his words in the right order, and he was maybe even more engaged in what he said than he otherwise is. 

https://youtu.be/GGcdILJ3wz0?t=242 

Regrettable it's an amateurish video but I guess that you guys got that clip somewhere. People need to analyze it and get to what is so good about how he phrased things. Because I was not the only one saying it was the best speech. 




 Sure. I can hate Warner Bros. more. But you still follow the guidelines and policies of your parent company.  




 Oh I forgot to tell the whole story. (the real story I'm not making this shit up as I go along lol).

In Sweden there is a Vacation Law. That basically says you are *entitled* to 4 weeks of consecutive payed vacation sometime between June and August.
Some people save a week or two. Others take it all. Others save them all for up to five years and just stops working for a year. (not very usual, but the vacation days can be saved up to five years)

There are exceptions when a company can order you back or else. But that has to be very special circumstances and I've never heard of it.

Bernie should have a political major advisor from Scandinavia.. 




 Yeah. I know but that doesn't matter. Warner is Warner. 




 That law should be in the Reddit amendments. 




 Why not make it Stump while we're at it? I learned to not use his real name because that's the only reason he's running. Name recognition and branding of himself... 




 I hate Time Warner ever since they ceased and desisted MERP. A Skyrim Mod set in Middle Earth. 




 USA has taken up the scent on welfare now brother. It sure feels good to sit on the other side of the great pond witnessing a revolution in progress. 

Because sadly our own budget yesterday was catastrophe . 




 "I can tell you I'm a little surprised. But I'm not" 




 In Sweden we get payed more than usual when we are on vacation... I'm almost feeling ashamed. 




 Open you mind. 

EDIT: I'm not in an environmental group. I read scientific papers based on tons of evidence about all kinds of subjects. The environment happens to be one of them. You can look it up yourself if you want. Evidence supported by far more than a handful of scientists. Your own [NASA](http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/) included. Which earth sciences Ted Cruz want's to cut funding for because they collide with his and his donor's personal interests. The reasons he give for wanting to ct their earth sciences research is because he don't think they should do research. But only space travel....  They are not interested in facts, and will try to shut down everyone who tries to give them facts.. You. The voter of America. Have to look at the evidence with open eyes and think. 

END EDIT :
Because what the oil industry is doing is taking the carbon that has been stored in the earth for billions of years. Dead animals and plants getting crushed and broken down into raw oil over the eons.

In an exponentially increasing rate we have been pumping it up. And set it on fire in engines and power plants. 

The chemical process while burning any kind of oil basically joins a carbon atom with 2 oxygen atoms, making it into a gas and released into the atmosphere. The increasing density of the molecule that is formed: CO2, due to the dark color of the carbon atom. Makes sunlight reflected on the earths surface (mostly ocean and ice caps reflect sunlight. But with increasing levels of carbon in the air more and more sunlight is being absorbed by the darker atoms, just like a black t-shirt gets warmer than a white t-shirt.

This is a spiral. The more carbon, the warmer it gets. And when millions and millions of years old ice melts and exposes methane gas trapped underneath. Temperatures will climb even more because methane absorbs even more sunlight. 


I'm sorry that you are a little out of the loop, genuinely. I understand what kind of upbringing you had. but you should always know that it is never to late to late. Never. ever to late to change.

Oh. And $2500 so out of touch with reality I'm almost crying.. [Read for yourself](http://www.thenation.com/blog/178743/koch-brothers-spent-twice-much-2012-election-top-ten-unions-combined) 412 670 666$, I have read higher and I have read lower. But nothing that comes close to your number.  




 I think you completely missed the point where I'm not a moron who needs a science education for a fucking 12-year old... 




 -8 points. So. People actually thought I corrected you?
Of course it's the Sun

It seems you have to write like you are talking to a five year old to make /r/science get that you are not a fucking moron. 

OH MY GOD.... That I don't believe in. I'm Swedish. We are atheists. Well. I'm the coward's kind of atheist. 




 You most certainly do. And I have not even mentioned the climate change and the fossil fuels. You do know that Cruz takes huge amounts of money from those two dudes who owns one of the biggest oil companies in the world?
The Koch brothers. Worth 40 billion dollars. EACH. Those guys deserve their money. I mean. Their father made them selling oil riggs to the russians after all. They should get to do whatever they want with it. Tax Free. Even though their company is one of the major contributors to the climate changing... And they neglecting the existance of the very phenomenon that would actually hurt their business?

The impending drought climate that is predicted to hit America in about 10-15 years, much due to the fact of global warming?

Let me guess. You don't believe in global warming. You are choosing to believe the 3 % of the world's scientists on this issue, instead of the 97% that says it's as real as you and me. And it's gonna have consequences.

OR. Maybe the 97% of all climate scientists in the world are flat-earthers?
If you knew what the scientific model was.. 




 EDIT: For some reason people seem to believe I'm a moron. To clarify. Of course the sun is a fusion reactor. I'm not retarded. And I just think that a building a fusion reactor here on earth is not only reaaaaaallly hard but also unnecessary because we already have one that's gonna hang around for about a couple of billion years. But hey. I know you want to educate people on science. I suggest you don't do it in the /r/science because here people actually know some things...

However we want to make "green energy" that is not nuclear. The energy is always gonna come from the sun. I am beginning to think Fusion Reactors is a red herring to keep us from beginning to invest in solar of various kind.

 




 Witchcraft. 




 Absolutely. The fact that you don't have paid paternity is beyond me. How the hell is that kid gonna develop naturally with that lack of stimulation? 




 I'll be a little surprised if you want. But I'm not.

Zero benefits is... Wow. They would get massacred by unions in Sweden if they were that big and didn't offer benefits. 




 It's something. But you should really begin to take your vacation. It's your right to do and your boss should be happy about it. You will be more productive if you have something to work for more than fridays. 




 Ja. Du har sklart rtt. Men eftersom vrlden r uppdelad i lnder s fr man gra vad man kan. Vi kommer f ett vrlds-EU/US/UK ngon gng i framtiden. Men tills det hnder tror jag tyvrr chansen r ganska liten att vi kommer f se sann solidaritet.. 




 Maybe. But your claim "knowing" is just plain ignorant. You can't know something that hasn't happend.  




 I think you mean dark ages. Well, better still... Imagine if religion did just touched the morale of things. And not people's entire lives. 




 Jag fixar. Welfare for everyone. 

Vnliga Regards, Sweden. The Welfare State. 




 I'll be a little surprised if you want. But I'm not. 




 EDIT completing the information: You poor bastards. We enjoy 25 days of payed, consecutive vacation a year (optional, of course. And you are able to save your days for up to five years, spreading it out or taking it all in one go)
Also you can save your overtime as vacation. Or take it out in money. Your choice.

But 2 weeks is a lot better than no weeks. So keep at it guys. You will win it. And [I shall cheer for you](http://www.sharegif.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Gladiator-quotes-3.gif) 




 I found this and it makes it easy to see how much a billion dollars is.
It's quite hard to fathom when just thinking numbers. 




 Sure you can believe that if you want. But the questions you need to ask yourself. Do you agree with his policies? 

I will tell you some of his policies:

**Flat Taxes**: That means people who owns a billion dollars will pay as much tax as one who owns ten thousand dollars. And ten dollars. Flat tax rate means everyone pays the same tax. Regardless of anything.

He wants to abolish **Net Neutrality**. That means he doesn't want internet providers to load all websites at the same rate. 
Basically advertising will load instantly, and the youtube video will load slow. Because the advertiser has payed a lot to increase their speed. Net Neutrality is good.. No.. IT'S GREAT and nothing we want to live without.

TED CRUZ **don't want abortions. **

Oh, and he hates **immigrants**, **homosexuals** and he want's to send US troops into the middle east again to fight ISIS. Instead of letting the neighbouring countries that are the good kind of Islam take care of things.

That was the last I had to say on this matter man. I hope you have opened your eyes, or are the biggest troll. Because otherwise..




 




 Ja, jag funderade med p om elpriset skulle pverka industrier. Och det gr de sklart. Du har rtt. nnu en anledning till att inte hja energiskatt p krnkraft istllet fr kol och olja.
Jag har debatterat s mycket att jag inte orkar att skriva fackligt. Jag r inte srskilt bra p det heller. Jag vill mest f folk att tnka till.

Inkomstskatt r en dlig skatt enligt mig. Antingen beskattar man frmgenhet eller konsumtion av varor som inte uppfyller de krav man stllt p dem rrande kvalit, milj eller arbetsfrhllanden.
Som du sger r det vldigt svrt att beskatta frmgenhet fr de smiter. Skattesmitare borde sprras in lika hrt som ngon som som kr ver ngon med bil och ker drifrn.

Stannar man och gr sin plikt r det lugnt. Tnker man bara p sig sjlv och ker drifrn ska man bli straffad.

Skatt p kapitalvinst r ju det bsta. P det sttet skrar man att pengarna stannar kvar i landet och inte sticker ivg via nn stiftelse till Bahamas. 









 Det var ett knslomssigt uttalande. Riskerna r ganska lga. Men vi har inga planer fr framtiden nr det kommer till krnkraften. Jag sa att jag var neutral. Jag vill inte avveckla den. Kanske i framtiden nr vi har bttre alternativ, men idag r det ett av vra bsta alternativ fr att producera en stor mngd el.

Men nd r detta det enda du tar till dig frn den hr trden...
Det r tragiskt hur blinda vissa r och hur instllda p sakfrgor de r. Jag har en vn som bor granne med Ringhals. Det r omjligt att hlla en diskussion med henne om detta fr hon pstr att det inte finns ngra nackdelar i princip. 




 Jag missade valet 2010 fr att jag r ett jvla decemberbarn. Nej du r inte ung och nyintroducerad. Du r en av f mnniskor som frsttt problemet med politiken. Inte bara i Sverige utan hela vrlden.

Vi r inte s rika att mnga skulle gynnas av en snkt frmgenhetsskatt. Det r inte en punkt majoriteten av alliansens vljare vill. nd r det politik de fr nr de vl har makten. Det luktar fisksoppa om alltihop. 




 Vnsterpartiets jobb r ju att frska gynna oss i Sverige med hjlp av deras ideologi. Precis som alla andra partier i riksdagen.. Inte fasen tnker de slppa in alla som vill komma hit och jobba. De verlever hemma, men de kanske fr det bttre stllt i Sverige. 
Att istllet slppa in dem som riskerar att bli knsstympade osv.osv. i sitt hemland, och frska integrera dem i vrt samhlle som ligger p plats 144 nr det kommer till reell befolkningstillvxt. Dr har du en av definitionerna till det dr ordet du frskte sga att vnstern saknar. Att folk inte fattar att vi kommer se tillbaka p den hr tiden som s jvla idiotisk r bortom all frstelse. Vra debatter gr i cirklar medan storebror str utanfr och gapskrattar t oss och vrt jvla tjat om [Inandningen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lcRQfzDXBs) 




 Titta p USA och se hur valfriheten hjlpt deras land. Kom tillbaka med argument till varfr det r bttre n hr. 




 *"Endast vid en (helt orealistisk) uniform frdelning skulle 40% rknas som fattiga."*
