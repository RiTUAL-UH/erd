 I'm gay.  But he's way cool.  Much cooler than I am.    




 Yup.  But, when the dispute is between a woman and a man, the ignorant public will typically judge on the side of the woman.   

I don't doubt that more often than not, it was the man that was being overly aggressive... so people just assume that this is the case EVERY-TIME.   I got caught in the trap of that.   

As a male I say it's bullshit.   But as a person I just say suck it up and move on because it's a fact of life.  And to remember that an open mind is useless without open eyes.   
  




 Me either.  And if I do click I read the headline, photos and captions... then I scroll to the bottom and watch the astroturfers and trolls duke it out on Disqus.  The more extreme or radical the comments in Disqus, the more likely the REAL story is something I should be concerned about. So I then look deeper for information on websites that don't try and sell me one crazy tricks...

Unless multiple reviews of the articles claim it's legit on reddit... I don't bother.  I'm so tired of being disappointed is all. 

And the comments on reddit that say it's a good article can't be stupid.  Like "DIS ARTICLE PREACH! CAUSE IT RIGHT!!!"  I coulda stayed on disqus if it's gonna be like that.    




 I just browsed porn instead.   




 The Major questions if she is still alive in Ghost in the Shell.  

She was definitely a real person at some point but had since had her entire body replaced with cybernetics beginning in childhood.   

It was safe to say she was no longer alive but self aware and conscious.

 You need to get a lawyer... and there are rules to who can file and what type of debt.  

If you have assets that can be liquidated they will be.  You can claim exemptions and keep some stuff... but for the most part yes you file, they liquidate what they can and the rest gets written off to the taxpayers.   

There are many different types of bankruptcy chapters you can file.   The best thing to do is talk to a lawyer and let them advise the best way forward.   

Keep in mind: its not all puppies and roses.  

You won't get credit again for a while. 
You won't be able to get an apartment without huge deposits . 
You have to live cash.   
You can have trouble gaining employment if they do a credit check.   

So you have to be sure you REALLY need it... because it doesn't necessarily make life easier.   For some, yes... it rescues them.  The outcome is less bad than the debt.   But if you're not having trouble paying your bills and your credit rating is good, there is zero reason to fuck that up with bankruptcy.

It really is absolutely massive and you can see it from great distances away.   

It will also be the death of us all.

 But they don't have insurance policies for these cases.  Who would insure against that?  The police are constantly being sued.  Someone is eventually going to win.   The premiums on this insurance would be astronomical.

 I'm not a doctor.  But I grow Coconut and produce coco oil.  

You might not want to use coconut oil.  Coconut oil is extracted from the copra, which is cooked over anything from coconut husk, to palm leaves, and some producers (not us) will even use cardboard.  

At any rate, there is a good deal of fungus that grows on the cooked copra.  Not only is the oil slightly acidic, but it's not just coconut that's in it.   One particular mold is a white mold... this mold tells you that the copra's water content is low and the meat is ready to be sold to the processor.   This white mold is an irritant to the lungs and eyes which causes a moderate amount of itching for about an hour after exposure.  While most of this mold gets filtered out, some will still remain.  The amounts remaining will have no effect if eaten, but a vagina is a bit more sensitive... 

Perhaps try a lubricant specifically designed for her lady parts and is balanced for PH and all that.   

Edit: Save the coco oil for cooking.  The health benefits are outstanding.  Better for you than olive oil.

 They both utilize the same technology.  

Edit: A very nutshell "How does it work" 

Transporters work by scanning the body's molecular structure, converting that into energy, and then shooting it to another location where the molecules are reassembled from available carbon.  

The replicator works by having molecular patterns of objects saved in memory.  It utilizes a "carbon block" as the source material where it uses a transporter beam to materialize the object.

Its all a bunch of mumbo jumbo hootinany nonsense.

 Who says it needs to consume 100% of our carbon.  

Why limit ourselves to any one solution?   Employ multiple solutions dynamically and regionally.... 

I'm so sick of the arguments against doing something always seem to amount to, "well it is impossible to get 100% so it doesn't work at all, or it's not worth doing." 




 Where is undersky in all of this?  




 Plus you could build the fern towers right next to the industry producing carbon.  You could capture 100% of the carbon and shove it at the ferns.  

even if you succeed at reducing only 20% of the carbon produced, its still beneficial.... and you get a profitable byproducts to go along with it.

 Well to people not on a doctors salary 6500 can be 30% of their yearly income.  So for the middle and lower class 6500 can be just as impossible to pay as 150,000.    So it doesn't really matter what the end number is to families that can't pay.  

It should be free. We are the richest nation to ever exist so my fuck it should be free.  For everyone rich and poor. 




 Then those aren't good mangers.  And it still has nothing to do with technical knowledge.   The point is that managerial skills can replace technical knowledge.  If you don't have the managerial skills, then you won't keep your job long when your department fails.

 Even then... if they are drunk it doesn't matter if they use a machete to rip your boxers away from your penis. It doesn't matter they could not give consent because they are inebriated.    

Which is dumb... because it says to women that they are inferior in the way they handle alcohol, and therefore not responsible for their actions while on alcohol.   This is how drunk women charge equally drunk men with rape.   

Edit: And it's because of this situation that REAL rape gets marginalized as falsely accused. See Bill Crosby about that.

I got the fuck beat out of me on the way out and they used my head to open the big ass solid wood door on the front of the establishment.   



 




 They do all the time.  Its about what kind of interest rate you're willing to accept.  Many lenders, like Citi, have daughter corps that specialize in subprime lending.  They'll lend to the shittiest of credit scores with the highest interest rates attached.  The profit is made in the tax write-offs when the borrower declares bankruptcy.    

Most people, who have 100,000 education costs, earn substantially more to go along with that.   Sure there are outliers that get underemployed... they get fucked and may have to go the chapt 13 route. Or if they make TOO MUCH they go another chapter as well.  Some get off only paying 20% of the debt back after it is restructured.   

The lenders make money.  They aren't just told to stuff it and walk away.  The taxpayers foot the bill.      

Edit: I should also note that it is not IMPOSSIBLE to discharge college loan debt through bankruptcy alone.  There are special cases, like when someone earned a PhD but now they work at mcDonald's, where the filer is allowed to discharge some or all of their college loans.  

 




 Chapter 7 remains on your credit for 10 years.   However, you can repair your credit through smart choices and Chpt 7 won't matter after just 2 years.  

As long as you show that you're paying your bills since the bankruptcy discharge date, you won't have problems obtaining credit.   Some people even get mortgages just 2 or 3 years after declaring bankruptcy.   

Some lenders may view you as less of a risk.   You cannot claim bankruptcy again until after that 10 year mark. So if you have a good income, and you show you're paying a secured credit card on time, a lender will agree to extend credit... 'cause you ain't getting off that hook.    They also know you're trying to rebuild your credit, so you're less likely to skip payments. 

Edit: Lastly, get all your advice from a lawyer.  Don't try to file on your own.

 What in the fuck?   Am I understanding this?  If I get free college, I get some 2nd string instructors?  

If I'm correct in that (if not please correct me), this basically turns public universities into junior college turd centers of the early 90s.    

Edit: It was supposed to say "junior college tutor centers".... but I think turd is good too so I'll leave it.    




 I'm sort of on the fence about this.  While on the surface it's easy to say, "Well that's bullshit they are managing something they don't have a clue about" I think it doesn't stand up to reality.    

I am called a "Logistical Engineer".   Basically I find systems that are broke... and I fix them. 

For example. I organized and oversaw the installation of a community water system that feeds over 10,000 homes.  I don't know shit about plumbing.   I just found people that did, and made sure they were where they needed to be.   

I organized the building of hundreds of clinics and hostpitals.... I don't know shit about construction.   


So while it's easy to think it's bullshit that a manager doesn't know the technical sides of what they are managing, it doesn't mean that they will be an ineffective manager.  

Like a master general controlling his undefeated armies, yet he's never actually fought in the trenches himself.     

One should feel encouraged to learn the technical side.  But it's not requirement to win.    




 That's a great point you made.  However, [research in Germany](http://healthland.time.com/2012/05/30/marijuana-compound-treats-schizophrenia-with-few-side-effects-clinical-trial/) doesn't really corroborate your claims here.  [Neither did the more recent findings in Australia.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2735555/Now-marijuana-used-TREAT-PREVENT-schizophrenia.html)   




 the oort cloud is outside the solar system?  




 say wha??

Bicycles don't even move at the same speed as other vehicles and are not typically found amongst them in the middle of the lane.  They are not motorized so they are not approaching at the same speeds as another vehicle.   

Most people do not ride them in places where the traffic moves faster than they can.   In New York City, the bicycles often move faster than the cars because they have the luxury of fitting where no cars do not, and dropping to the sidewalk (even if illegal) to avoid snags.   That doesn't stop them from being killed.  They have all the dangers of a motorcycle with none of it's advantages.     

So bicycles don't even belong in the same comparison as motorized vehicles.    

The end point is: motorcycles are **immensely** deadlier than cars.  I'm not really understanding how someone who claims to have been riding since the mid 70s is trying to assert otherwise.  

The risk of dying in a car is still present.  But that doesn't mean equal.

 [That depends on what state you're in.](http://www.totalbankruptcy.com/chapter-7/requirements/median-income-tables.aspx)  And it goes up if you have a family.

In which case you'll do chapter 13.  which does waive some debt, you just have to repay a percentage of it.... which is a lot better than 100%.   Many people end up just paying 5 to 20% of what they owe.

 What??  Bankruptcy is a constitutional right.   You file it with the courts and don't say shit to the lender.   




 Descent 3 did this to me. 




 They are downvoting me because it's kind of a douche baggery thing to do.  

Although the banks are douche bags so it's hard for me to get angry over them getting fucked.   Which they aren't.... the taxpayers are.   

Some people take the attitude that their taxes have paid for bankruptcies so they don't feel bad about utilizing their constitutional right.   And people really forget that... they look down and talk shit to people that declare bankruptcy like they are bad people.  But they forgot that its a goddamn constitutional right.   Its how our society protects itself.    




 Well I know of three people that did it from my time working in a shady lending center. I worked there for 1 month and saw 3 people that did this.  

It's not a matter of securing the loan, but what interest rate you are willing to pay.   And if you're gonna do bankruptcy then the interest rate doesn't matter.   

This is especially useful to people that are fully employed in the career field they were educated in.  So the income they receive is often more in line with the tuition they paid and therefore easier to lend on.   

Even if your credit is shitty, you can get a loan.   While I worked there we routinely took 525 credit score.  And one guy, with a 495 score, received 25 thousand at 23% interest rate.   

So, you can always find some shitty dirtback lender that loans out.  These lenders are counting on bankruptcy claims happening, because it allows them to do some tax jiggery applesauce where they still turned a profit.

 The difference is, you don't die from a fender bender in a car.  


You die from the things that shred people in cars on a bike.  And you also elevate small taps to life threatening situations.  

On a bike you have every single possible danger that exists for a car.   And then you add some to it by elevating non-life threatening events into ones that easily cause death.   

I'm a motorcyclist and I've been riding for a long long time, I'm highly experienced, and even taught the motorcycle safety course that was required by the military to ride on post.     I also sold my bike yesterday because the risk is not worth it.   




 What the fuck are you even talking about?  

Ok so A car you have the same danger of getting stuck by a 80mph truck and dying.  

on a bike you STILL have that danger IN ADDITION to elevating minor fender benders into life threatening situations....which you don't have in a car.  

I've been riding for 15 years and it's clear you haven't a single clue what you're talking about.
