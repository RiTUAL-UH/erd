 From Wikipedia
 As of the census[10] of 2000, there were 5,920 people, 2,371 households, and 1,707 families residing in the county. Since 2000, however, **an oil boom has increased the population by at least 1,000.**

Guessing it has a lot to do with that (at least for the employment age brackets). 
 




 I wonder... 




 God, it's only the first set and I've already started pacing up and down in my living room... 




 Break to love? Damn! 




  most guys refuse to go down on women

Haha, what? What gave you that idea?

 




 Wow. Just... wow. One of the strongest performances I've ever seen from any player! 




 If my prediction jinxes it for Roger I'll send him an apologetic fruit basket after. 




 Here's my prediction: Federer gets the first two sets, Murray the third, Federer wins it in the 4th set tie break. 

EDIT: So far, so good. 1-0 Federer

EDIT 2: We're still on course! 2-0 Federer

EDIT 3: Federer was in a hurry. No 4th set tiebreak.  




 But what happened to the princess??? 




 Wow, Djokovic basically broke his own serve just now... 




 Oh right. Duh. Brain fart on my part.  




 Anderson with 3 aces in the first game...

EDIT: 2 break points for Anderson. Wait. 1 break point.

EDIT 2:  "Fidnee Lob". How come so many of the umpires are unable to pronounce the (very limited) jargon essential for their job? They could learn it in like ten minutes...

EDIT 3: Fantastic ralley at 2-2, 30:15

EDIT 4: Another Deuce in a Novak serving game. Wait, he's got it. Phew!

EDIT 5: Novak with no answers to Anderson's serve as of yet...

EDIT 6: In my heart of hearts I thought this would be a quick affair, with Djokovic coming out on top. Not looking that way right now...

EDIT 7: Was Anderson targeting Hawkeye with that return?

EDIT 8: Anderson could win it in the next game. Crazy...

EDIT 9: But he doesn't. 5-5.

EDIT 10: that's a bad double fault from Anderson. 15-30.

EDIT 11: Djokovic breaks and gets to serve for the match! Anderson self-destructed in this game...

EDIT 12: 0:30! Are we going to tiebreak?

EDIT 13: matchpoint Djoker!

EDIT 14: Djoker sews it up on the first try. Wow, how intense was this?! 




 I have this urge to hand him a pair of red swimming trunks and a safety buoy, and have him go to Malibu to save drowning people by day and lay with beautiful women at night.

Tommy Haas is Baywatch-handsome!
