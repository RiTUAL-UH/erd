 Can we please get [this place](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7I3k5PhW5xc/TNyh0RmPUmI/AAAAAAAAB6s/MfUb4peVoao/s1600/mikitas.jpg) put up for real! 




 The Southside during 1967... you wouldn't have wanted to be there in '68. 




 I'm going to start my day eating the Roasted Duck Soup at [Dong Ky](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dong-ky-chinese-and-vietnamese-restaurant-chicago) to bring us a positive omen tonight. 

Also, reset the flair to Cap'n Serious; I feel like he's going to come through for us tonight.

 Go ahead and nourish your houseplants. Don't you dare leave that room!

 You're gonna be up late anyway, just start a load of laundry after you inevitably soil yourself. NO TIME FOR BATHROOM BREAKS 




 Waking up at 5:30 tomorrow... *it's gonna be a rough one, ya know* (Rodney Dangerfield voice) 




 Sausage King of Chicago confirmed. 




 Confirming his Frenchness. 




 Advice, huh?

 Why did the Ducks ever get rid of [these jerseys!?!?!?!](http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v1/1826626797_1/Anaheim-Ducks-CCM-Hockey-Jerseys-8-Teemu-Selanne-Jersey-Purple-9-Paul-Kariya-Stitched-Jersey-Accept.jpg) 




 Check out Forest Park. Elmhurst and Oak Park are going to be more expensive than that, and you'll have access to the CTA in Forest Park. 




 PRAISE LEBRON! I stopped watching basketball in 2011 because of all of the bullshit calls in that Heat-Bulls series. Breathing on LeBron is a foul, and he also has special privileges to travel... thus ends my rant.  




 *It's gonna be a rough one, ya know.* 




 I could go for a paleta. 




 The break dancing was after they parallel parked the car at 55 mph. Clearly, this was prior to entering the library. 




 The rant is worth a listen though! "Let's go to Michael in Indianapolis..." 




 *Just Chicken in on ya...

I almost crashed my car when Bill was imitating the struggling Deathbeak before it's untimely death. 




 [Again, an important message to all of Crow's critics and hecklers out there.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifCmvLNQl3s feature=youtu.be t=31) 




 I like how doc got so much praise for pronouncing "Granlund" correctly, yet he insists on saying "JAHLMERSIN."  




 Pierre: "Excuse me for a minute." 




 NBC is giving away a Family Truckster. 




 Blues are professional choke-artists. 




 "You're all winners in my eyes. I'm [Linda Kollmeyer.](http://img.youtube.com/vi/qMeYIUDRuV4/0.jpg)

Good luck and good night, Chicago."

 [Actual video of Crow tonight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz9cZ9zcQMg feature=youtu.be) 




 1. Kaner

2. Crow

3. Oduya 




 Can you blame him for being hammered? It's 6-0 for crying out loud.  




 [(Big) Mike Hoffman vs. Nolan Yonkman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w64AT4MYy6Q)

The 250lb. heavyweight class, someone was bound to get knocked out. 




 You've got to hate Roussel. 

He actually has had truly epic bouts with Shaw.

[Then again this past fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJdTV4qg_Kk)

 




 The best. I love how Westgarth initially skates to the penalty box as if he doesn't need to get his face put back together.  




 My first car was also a Cavalier with a palindrome year.

[1991 Cavalier RS](http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/4/430/3609/38574304002_original.jpg?v=0) it looked just like this picture, except I had white wheels. When I finally traded it in, it had 175,000 miles, and rust had consumed the doors. I got $100 for it in 2007. 




 [Looks like Panarin signed to a 2-year entry-level deal as well](http://forecaster.thehockeynews.com/hockeynews/hockey/movements.php?Chi) 




 So that's what Augustus Gloop has been doing all these years.  




 It has to be Dean; and the voice can't be as old as the video either since the 630 area code isn't even 20 years old.  




 Ok. Which one of you is the guy in that ad? 




 [From the game thread on r/hockey](https://gfycat.com/HandmadeWindyHeterodontosaurus) 




 The fans will be lonely after they leave, 

'Cause it's back to NASCAR 

and shootin' varmints in the spring... 




 Plus, if someone needs to drop the gloves, #11 should get the green light. I'll have my playoffs with some more Desjardins mustard please. 




 Him and Saad just busted the door down on this period with guns blazing. 




 It'll be funny in some context where someone is making fun of Rahm, but nobody in their right mind is surprised by this. 




 Yes, actually I do want to see this movie, for almost no other reason than the Corolla XRS [in the movie trailer] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqg8pji2FWI), or the taco that guy was holding. 




 We're gonna need some flying buttresses here, people! There are lives at stake here!!!! 




 THE MUTT!! He's got some rabies in him now, he's going to get his chance tonight. I can feel it.  




 ...you can take em off in a stall!!! 









 That's one happy human out there on the worldwide web, Pat.
 




 Ha! That voice could very well have been Bobby Kelly. Oh man, did that guy put on weight though.  









 I love how he says "he's got this friend" who always buys into fad diets... then proceeds to do an impersonation of Paul Virzi. 

"Dude, I don't even need to eat bread..." 




 Who's got the HAHHHHT to tell him that the Kings are eliminated? 




 One of my darkest times was in 2003-2004, my dad brought home a Red Wings hat and a Stars hat randomly, and I... I wore the wings hat  a number of times that year/during the lockout. 




 Jewel was a good job for me throughout high-school and college; you can work pretty flexible hours as a student. Although, I'm not sure that everyone still gets time and a half every Sunday (I worked there 2005-2012) you can make a higher wage on Sundays and holidays, and I ended saving up more than my friends who worked seasonal jobs or at Park Districts, etc. 




 Does it look like a mountain lion to you?

 Someone made one with Uptown as "Zombie Apocalypse," but I have no idea what corner of the internet it ended up in. 




 The top reason I hate the Cardinals is that I have gotten caught behind a gaggle of their fans who take forever to get on the Clark bus, and then proceed to be fat and obnoxious as they linger like a giant fart cloud of ignorance 




 I want to see Marcus Kruger do a few victory donuts on the ice in his CJ Wilson Mazda. 




 Reading Sharp's lips as he congratulates Crawford: "Hey, we won... we won!!" 




 THE CHICAGO BEARS ARE WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE! 




 2 cups, 2 gold medals, and he's not done yet. I'm the same age as Captain Serious so... off to work on my resume.
