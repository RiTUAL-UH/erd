 What a candid title! 




 What types of writing do you do? Short stories? Poems? Novellas? 




 Watch the film [Finding Forrester](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/3b7xg9/guys_dont_miss_the_film_finding_forrester_i_just/). 




 I practice by writing short stuff such as freeverse paragraphs and poems, flash fiction, short stories and quotes.

* [Freeverse paragraphs and poems](https://medium.com/word-dust) help me to explore the beauty of language.
* Flash fiction helps me in sharpening the skill of developing an engaging fictional pieces.
*  Short stories challenge me to shape a story that has the main elements of storytelling, such as conflict, purpose, character and etc.
* Quotes help me to understand myself better. They act as self-advices. 

These are the ways in which I practice my writing. In what ways do you practice yours?
 




 [Shiva Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immortals_of_Meluha) by Amish Tripati. He is the recent Indian literary revolution, after Chetan Bhagat. 




 Pretty awesome painting bro.... IF the same would've been drawn by a great painter, it would worth millions. It's that good IMO. I would suggest you to give it a name. 




 He quietly nailed it. 




 But you need this Polish proverb to realize that you need no accuser. 




 No wonder Tagore has won a Nobel in Literature. 




 What all of his have you read? 




 Heard of it quite a lot. But the length of the novel is making me hesitate. I'm yet to get into mainsteam large classics. That's why I started with short ones. Will surely read it but not in a while. That and also *East of Eden.* 




 Ever since I read Gitanjali by Tagore I understood the potential of writers who win Nobels in Literature. So, from then on every now and then I pick up something written by Nobel laureates. As of now I've read:

* Tagore (Gitanjali)
* Herman Hesse (Siddhartha; Steppenwolf)
* Ernst Hemingway (The Old Man and the Sea)
* John Steinbeck (Of Mice and Men; The Pearl)

I realized that I prefer short novels of such people which gives a glimpse of the kind of work they do and the type of stories they tell. 

From the above list, only Ernest Hemingway's book *The Old Man and the Sea* bored me badly (sorry, fans). Rest of them were somewhere between good to great reads. 

What are your favourite (preferrably short) works from Nobel winners in literature? 




 An upvote to anything that comes from Thoreau. Anyday. 




   people who have not yet had a chance to start existing,

I like the way you put it.

Apart from that I can't offer you any help here because I'm as confused as you are, if not more. Sorry. 




 OH MY GOD.. It's one of the best covers ever designed. No kidding. Never thought one can put so much sense of humour into a book cover.

EDIT: Too bad it's not available for purchase now :( 
Can you suggest me a way that I can get this edition? (I'm from India) 




 Yeah neither did I ever read James Bond books.. but I too liked those covers. They're true to the Bond-ness. 




 Hey, Medium is an awesome place to blog up stuff.. And your Collection (now called Publication?) *On Literature* was pretty good one.. Especially I liked the 9 covers of Moby Dick even more.
Thank you for sharing here :)) Keep collecting awesome book covers. 




 Oh that cover was poetic, nothing less! 




 Hey that's a beautiful piece of art... pencil sketch I suppose?? 









 Oh Yes... With Harry and Dumbledore standing amidst the red yellow swirling fire.. oh God that was a fantastic thing :)))

EDIT: [This is what I was referring to, and also the newly published editions with looks similar but more graphic and intense.](http://harrypotterfanzone.com/wp-content/2009/06/hbp-uk-kids-jacket-art.jpg) 




 Wow.. that spine art is beautiful, man :) 




 Just found a resource of enthralling book covers. An archive that is filled of only them :D
http://blog.bookcoverarchive.com/
 




 OK, talking of book covers, I just found about this [TED talk.](http://www.ted.com/talks/chip_kidd_designing_books_is_no_laughing_matter_ok_it_is) 




 That's a pretty great to design a cover like that especially for 1984. 




 The cover is truly splendid. I will read this book. Thank you so much for sharing it here :)) 

(This is precisely the purpose of this post: to explore, find and pick up new books inspired by their wondrously designed covers.) 




 Thanks... I bought this book last year. Looking at your comment, I just now picked it to read soon. 




 I just finished reading 'The Subtle Knife' (the second book in the HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy by Philip Pullman) and I collected these two awesome bookcovers: http://imgur.com/gallery/3qlpX/new

What are your favourite book covers? Please do share if you have the pictures. It would be pretty exciting to know about new books in this way. Thanks :) 




 Now, this is what I call a classic nature gif. 




 Dude, that shit was so repelling to look at. 




 EDIT: I don't know why the post is being downvoted.. Can't we just discuss a movie about *writing* or what?? 




 And also:

 "'I wish I had seen this, or I wish I had done that, or I wish..." 
Most of you are too young to know what your wishes will be. But when I read these words words of hope, dreams, I realise that the one wish that was granted to me, so late in life was the gift of friendship. 




  Especially the end speech.

Yes.. the way it starts, man.. what beautiful words!!! :)))

I only managed to find these:

Losing family... obliges us to find our family. Not always the family that is our blood, but the family that can became our blood. And should we have the wisdom to open our door to this new family...we will find that the wishes and hopes we once had...for the father who once guided us, for the brother who once inspired us...those wishes are there for us once again. 




 and also this line that Jamal types on the typewriter: 

*through that dark tunnel. To me it is as beautiful as a deep black night.*  




  what I would pay to read the finished works in that movie.

Yeah seriously. What a beauty of words they contained in them! They're awesome. If only they're available for real... 









 Would you please like to share the blog link here if you don't mind?? :) 




 Hey, the quoted excerpt from your blog is pretty awesome. It's as good as a non-fiction piece. And also thank you so much for the other suggestions as well :))) 









 Hey, The Moth looks very interesting and helpful. Thank you so very much :))) 




 Yes. Thank you so much :)))) 




 Hey thanks a lot :)))))  




 My friend just mentioned today a play from his childhood that he read in a book then. He is trying to remember it now. I told him I will try finding it. Please read the below text (a summary of the play) and suggest the title of the play or the book if you know it. PLEASE.

"an excerpt from a play about a man who has broken with his fiancee and leaves her flat angrily but forgets his hat he is too proud to travel without his hat but doesn't want to go back in her apartment so he tries to bribe peopleinto going in her flat and get the hat for him it is hilarious as he encounters a clerk, a poet, a cop etc i just wish to find it and read again"

Thanks, guys.
 




 Thanks, mod :) Trying them too.

 ~ said no one ever. 




 then is [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/QuotesPorn/comments/3anljr/please_pay_attention_very_carefully_because_this/) fakely credited? 














 I will be very happy to have your answer.. Please do come back :) 




 Thank you so very much for the response. The suggestions you gave sounds promising. I will try to incorporate them into my daily life to develop the skill of storytelling. Thank you so much once again :) 









 'save' button deserves this post. 




  Because of this, I think that an author's level of accomplishment often lies in their capacity for empathy. It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who has experienced something that you haven't, but being able to understand their experience (or try to at least) is an invaluable skill.

Spoken like a true genius that you are. 




  Something Wicked This Way Comes

I think I'm going to pick that one up soon. 




 I'm an aspiring writer. And I also want to develop my storytelling skills. By 'storytelling' I mean actually telling them, not just in text but in voice, by speaking it out, by narrating it. 

I'm sure many of you guys are not only great writers of stories but also engaging tellers of those stories. I sincerely believe that there is a fine bit of difference between writing a story and telling it out for others. The biggest difference that I can argue about is that a written story is usually for people who read, and there are many, many people around the world who don't read (novels and such) but I'm sure no one is possibly averse to listening to a great story that's being told to them. (I also think this is a reason that makes movies differ from books, in a way.)

Please help me by giving some suggestions on:

* how to develop this skill 
* what kind of story suits better to be told than to write (if)
* what body language affects people in storytelling process
* how to engage your audience better when you're telling them a story

and anything else that you think would be important for a good story teller.

I'm really counting on this as it's very important for what I'm trying to do.

Thank you so much, guys. You're awesome :) 




 Just incase you didn't see [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3au4qq/dammit_dammit_dammit/) already. 




 A church in shock. 




 From his [commencement speech.](http://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/23/john-waters-risd-commencement-transcript/) 




  Might finish it someday

I end up falling into such situation sometimes.. Well, all the best to you too :) 




 Music helps a lot, and ofcourse also its accompanying lyrics. Photograhs. Paintings... and emotions mostly. 




 I love Neil Gaiman. 




  If there was a way then I would send you my copy.

Thank you so much for saying that. I would love to have it from a fellow booklover like you :)  




 Yes. Have to agree.. Awesome title that is. 




  Loaned

Yeah that's a completely valid one. It means: *Give temporarily; let have for a limited time* 




   lent (leant? Lended?)

You used it correctly. 'lent' is the only correct usage here (and also there is no 'lended').  




 Yes. Cloud Atlas is also something that I want to read it. I liked the cover that has 6 squares on it, but now it is not available in my country (India). The only edition that I could see online is the one with the film poster on it. :/ 




 A recent book whose title is attracting me so much is *All the Light We Cannot See* by Anthony Doerr 




 I don't do that very much although I buy lots of books when they're available at good prices. I keep them for future reading. But I've a childhood friend of mine who likes very much to shop books but never reads much of them at all. I also think that my friend never actually finished any single book in his life.  




 Yeah I too tend to do this sometimes. 




 I'm so happy about this, sir :D 




 awesome background... 




 thanks for this one... I need this. 









  Stephen King's private jet.

TIL that Stephen King has a private jet. 




 woah dude! 




 Nice insight. 




 Ever since I watched films like *Inception*, *Memento*, and recently *Interstellar* I too was wondering how to show such a non-linearity in writing.  









 Thoreau is a remarkable milestone of a person in my life. His *Walden* has changed my life forever. No kidding. 




 Those lines were awesome...  




 DO THE SHIT BRO. DO THE SHIT THAT GETS YOU SOMEWHERE IN LIFE. EVERY GODDAMN MORNING WE WAKE UP AND GO AHEAD LIVING THE SAME LIFE IN THE SAME MISERABLE FUCKING WAY. WE GOT TO TAKE THAT SHIT AND BEND IT AND SHOVE SOMETHING UP ITS ASS SO THAT IT KNOWS WE'RE NOT ITS TITTIES. 

WAKE THE FUCKING UP IN THE MORNING BRO AND GET THE SHIT RIGHT FOR THE ENTIRE DAY. PLAN THE DAY AHEAD AND FUCKING STICK WITH IT BRO. THAT WORKED FOR ME WHEN I WAS IN GREAT OF IT. HOPE IT HELPS YOU TOO. JUST TRY IT OUT.

STARTING AN ONLINE BUSINESS IS A PRETTY FUCKING COOL ENTREPRENEURSHIP VENTURE. LIVE UP TO IT. I HOPE YOU WILL FIND ALL THAT IS NEEDED FOR IT TO GET UP AND RUN.

KEEP DOING GREAT THINGS BRO. EVEN IF YOU FAIL TO do MANY DO JUST AS MUCH. 




 I'M 25 AND VERY AMBITIOUS AND ASPIRING. BUT THE THINGS THAT I'M DOING IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW ARE NOT IN FUCKING UNISON WITH ANYTHING. THAT'S THE BIGGEST MOTHERFUCKING PROBLEM I'M FACING RIGHT NOW. I'M FIGHTING WITH MYSELF. I MUST. 

I WASTE A HELL LOT OF FUCKING TIME BY GETTING LOST IN A BUZZ OF THOUGHTS IN MY MIND THAT KEEPS MY FROM WORKING TOWARDS MY LIFE'S CONCERNS. I REALIZED THAT IT IS MY FUCKING PROBLEM. THE BUZZ. I SHOULD CONTROL IT. FUCKING TIE IT DOWN BY ITS NECK AND HANG IT TO DEATH. SO THAT IT WON'T TROUBLE ME IN ACHIEVING MY CONCERNS.

I HAVE THE FOLLOWING CONCERNS FOR MY BEAUTIFUL LIFE. THESE ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT MY HEART ALWAYS WANTS, AND THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT MY LIFE. I WANT TO DEDICATE THE NEXT FEW YEARS OF MY LIFE COMPLETELY TO THESE THINGS BY ABANDONING EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS PETTY.

* **MBA ENTRANCE EXAM**- AIMING FOR SOME PREMIER INSTITUTES
* **JOB** - TO DO WELL IN THE CURRENT ONE AND LEARN GOOD DEAL OF SKILLS
* **READING BOOKS** - I NEED THIS BECAUSE I'M AN ASPIRING WRITER
* **WRITING** - OH THIS IS AFTER ALL MY LIFE'S WHOLE POINT AND PURPOSE. I GOTTA WRITE. FICTION. NON-FICTION. POETRY. SHORT STORIES. I JUST WANT TO WANDER AND FLY AND DIVE IN THE WORLD OF WORDS.

WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS IN LIFE, BROTHERS, AND WHAT IS IT THAT'S STOPPING YOU IN THE JOURNEY? LET'S TALK TO ONE ANOTHER ABOUT THEM. 




 I'm from India.. Heard that they're not going to come out here in a long long while :( 




  It's just as good as the real thing.

That's very encouraging actually. Thanks, buddy. 




 My favourite bad book covers are those novels that have real photographs on them for covers. They just repel me. 




 Harry Potter series. 




 Sorry for coming out as harsh in my comment. I didn't mean that at all. The story ended so well in the sense of plot and writing. No doubt about that.  




 No. I didn't think like that. 




   I never saw Interstellar in a real theatre

Oh oh oh buddy! I can't tell you how sorry we all are to hear this. 




  This film needs IMAX.

*IMAX* needs this film. 




 After the movie was finished I just kept reciting the F-word many, many times for myself, out of pure inexplicable awe of the story and the places it took me as an aspiring writer. 




  we sold the house to a young couple who yanked out the pole and the sticks and left them by the road on garbage day. 

This sentence should've been written in a new line. It seemed a bit too continuous with its previous line. Apart from that the story is hauntingly deep. Thanks for sharing. 




 :/ 




 I'm stunned. 




  I didn't really enjoy the book

Oh... Sorry to hear that. 




 That exact cover was the reason I didn't buy the book and preferred to read it on my Kindle. I mean, who comes up with such a shitty cover replacing the awesome one?? 




 I'm reading only 11th and 12th books of the year right now:

* The Subtle Knife by Philip Pullman
* David and Goliath by Malcolm Gladwell

I really got to pick up more books soon. 




 **Can somebody please suggest me some short story collections in the *quantum fiction* genre?** 









 I NEED TO HEAR THIS SHIT, BROTHER. THANK YOU. 




 They are. 




 I WOKE UP EARLY MORNING AT 5AM AND STUDIED FOR A LITTLE WHILE. ONLY FOR A FUCKING LITTLE WHILE. AND THEN AT 7AM I HAD TO TAKE AN ONLINE MOCKTEST FOR AN EXAM I'M PREPARING. THE TEST WAS OF NEARLY 3 HOURS. I REALLY FELT THAT I PERFORMED WELL IN ONE SECTION OF THE TEST. SO, I WAS LOOKING FORWARD FOR THE RESULTS. BUT WHEN I SUBMITTED MY TEST, THE GODDAMN SERVER FAILED. IT FUCKING FAILED. AND LIKE THAT BEGAN MY ONE OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING WEEKENDS IN THE RECENT TIMES.

AT 12PM I WENT TO THE COACHING CLASSES THAT I ENROLLED INTO FOR THE EXAM PREP. AND SLOWLY AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS OF CLASS I STARTED FEELING SLEEPY (BECAUSE I WASN'T HAVING ENOUGH SLEEP OVER THE WEEK DUE TO WORK AND STUFF LIKE THAT). AFTER 2PM A NEW CLASS HAS STARTED WHERE AN IMPORTANT MATH TOPIC WAS GOING ON 'PERMUTATIONS   COMBINATIONS.' AND I WAS HARDLY ABLE TO KEEP MY EYES OPEN DUE TO THE GODDAMN DROWSINESS. BY TRYING TO KEEP MYSELF FROM SLEEP IN THE CLASS, I STARTED TO GET HEADACHE. AND LIKE THAT I LOST THE ENTIRE LECTURE AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.

FIRST THE TEST'S SERVER PROBLEM WHICH LOST ME MY PERFORMANCE CHECK. AND THEN BEING A SLEEPYFUCKINGHEAD PISSED ME OFF SO MUCH.

ALSO RECENTLY MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW ARE GOING BAD. MOSTLY THIS EXAM THING. MAN, I'M SO NOT DOING JUSTICE TO IT. 




 A linguistics professor says during a lecture that, In English, a double negative forms a positive. But in some languages, such as Russian, a double negative is still a negative. However, in no language in the world can a double positive form a negative.
But then a voice from the back of the room piped up, Yeah, right. 




 *The Alchemist* by Paulo Coelho. This book has been a great life changer for me. The concepts that it dealt with, such as *following your dreams* and *reading omens,* have become a crucial part of my life ever since. So, I just want to pass on the word. 









 I don't know.. I just thought this is an interesting idea that I stumbled on the internet today.. so posted it here.  









 Which is why you need to wield it with great force. 




 Ok. So, becoming wise can be depressing. 




 And not on Reddit so much.. I mean, it keeps coming up here so much that if you're a skinny guy you wonder if you're useless in life. 









 Maybe the part of his heart that deals with the human loss doesn't let him be just because he saved her kid.  




 Looking at all these insightful posts that carry a perspective from my most loved book series in my life I strongly feel that I need to give them multiple rereads to understand them this well. Thanks :) 




 Good, one :D 




 What a deep insight! 




   this, almost perfectly.

I strongly believe that comma is not necessary there. 




 To me this shot seemed like a satire on the Mankind. We fight one another no matter what world we live in. 




 BATMAN 




  I wonder why he's not at Reddit anymore...

Dude. He died on Jan 11th, 2013. He hanged himself at last in the fight for internet freedom. 




 Oh sorry. There is a similar line from his *Carrie* as well. I just mistook it. Thanks for the clarification.
