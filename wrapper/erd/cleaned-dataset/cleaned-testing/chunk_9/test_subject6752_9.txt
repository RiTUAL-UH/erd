 I care how my genitals look and so does my wife and that does matter. 




 6 months tomorrow!  




 I'm also married to a lesbian! However, since I am one and I'm actually married to her, I think mine turned out better. 




 Well we have been married for 6 months tomorrow. I guess it was the right choice! 




 Thanks for clearing this up! 




 All of that is estimated extremely high and is a setup for two gerbils. 




 Don't get one; get two. They are very social. 




 We haven't! Exhibit a; my mother. I like girls and am married to one and that's great. I wear men's shorts and all of a sudden I'm trans and no longer her only daughter. 




 I'm a trying-not-to-be-trans only "girl" of four as well. I hope it goes over well! 




 Lesbian here as well. My wife takes everything. She's high femme yet somehow all of my t-shirts and jeans and boxers and sports bras and hoodies are always missing. 




 I'm sorry to hear that. I live in the states, and qualify for welfare health insurance so mine is paid for despite living in a country known for shitty healthcare. I hope you find something that works for you.  




 Little kids laughing, dogs sniffing flowers, strangers saying good morning. 




 Well I'd start by calling a hotline to keep myself from doing it. If I needed, I'd make my way to an emergency room.  




 I sort of have this. My wife is agreeing to me taking time off until I'm ready to go back to work, but I do resume college in August. I haven't worked or gone to school since mid February. I am using it to sort out my mental health issues. I have depression and anxiety and suspicions of PTSD/BPD/bipolar, and any combination thereof. I'm working on that. If I were healthier mentally I'd be getting fit, since I'm fat. Right now though, I don't need the added stress of counting calories and stress of not losing fast enough.  




 Yep. They pick through the garbage, pick through dumpsters, pick up change to buy food.

 Race isn't real, so you can't have a "white soul". And why does it matter what makes someone trans? The only thing that helps transpeople is transition. 




 What black child wouldn't want to be white? It's easier to get a job, less hassle from police, and plenty more perks. 




 You provided nothing to say that people even experience racial dysphoria. They are different because race is not real and gender is. 




 No, I don't, but until you can show me proof of "racial transition" being an affective way to treat "racial dysphoria" I don't feel it's equal to transexualism. There are tons of sources of proof that transition is the only affective treatment for transpeople. Are you actually trying to imply that transitioning is equal to blackface? 




 Do you realize that killing pets during childhood is something many sociopaths do? I think they should err on the side of caution and take her to counselling. 




 No problem! I hate seeing people upset when there isn't too much of a reason for it. I get how /u/Aerik came to his conclusion but I just didn't see it that way. 




 Race isn't real, sweetie, that's already been established. People try to darken their skin all the time; it's called tanning. 









 I'm a lesbian. I think it's more like he feels bad that he couldn't be "good" enough for her to want to continue to completion. He did something better than that, though. He stopped when her consent was gone, even though she had already agreed.  




 I don't mean to pressure you, but I kept trying to get better on my own and trying to ignore it. Make one appointment. If you hate it, quit. If you like it but hate the person, switch. It is so worth it to go. Just give it a shot. One appointment is an obligation to nothing more than an hour. Please try it out. 




 I thought Ireland legalized a couple weeks ago? Anyway, I'm sorry you had that experience. For me, being gay in high school wasn't so bad. Aside from my wife I had supportive friends and a younger brother who beat everyone up who picked on me. Even teachers weren't awful. I had a few issues but never physical violence. I hope you can do something to help you get better with that. Maybe try counselling; it helps me a lot. 




 We do! Since I'm not even 21 yet we were told to bring our marriage licence everywhere. We live in a state that is kind of ass backwards so we were told that for safety we should always have it. We think we are the youngest married same sex couple in our area. We also appreciate that we are each others only sexual partner. We got really lucky that we met so young. 




 I'd wager that it's a fake name and not really identifying. Hell, my username will lead you to my fake name Facebook. 




 I was nervously writing more neatly than usual. When I take notes in class I can't even read them. I don't even bother anymore. 




 My older brother is adopted, and we are 24 years apart in age. He and I are so much alike it's scary. My mom will call me (her daughter) his name is frustration. Familial ties have nothing to do with blood. 




 No the very first time per session anything is inside is the best feeling in the world, even if its only a little bit in. 




 My wife disagrees with you, and she has a big leeeeeeesbian crush on me, so suck on that! 




 Hahaha well she was sort of seeing/friends with a girl at my table so she was around a lot. I've always had a ton of male friends so she thought I was dating three guys at once. We ended up having a lot of friends in common and when things went sour with the other girl, she came to me because, since I was gay, it was a safe spot. We became friends fast since I'm wonderful and yeah. I made a point of being a shining star for her. I stuck up for her in two different lunch time drama events and then waited for her by the busses the next school year and carried her bookbag the one time each day I had the opportunity. I didn't know how to go about proving myself without being "the guy" so that's what I did. 

Fun fact: it took me three months from meeting to learn her name.

 At my school, sort of poor meant 40 cents for any lunch and really poor was free for any lunch. 




 My mom always made sure we had lunchables for field trips for this exact reason! We got free lunch so regular school days we had hot food.  




 I graduated three years ago yesterday. I still talk to my wife, one friend and her husband who I went to high school with.  




 Female here. I used to work with a man with Down syndrome. His father informed me that his handwriting is nicer than mine. He was so right I couldn't even be mad. 




 Wal-Mart brand is edible. Way better than Digiorno. 




 60 seconds? Bro I can pop a top and grab a fork in like 7 seconds. 




 I'm not prego, but grew up poor. Lunchables are where it's at. 




 No, no! It's a good thing when boys do that! It means they like you! /s 




 You do realize this went from issues faced by a group to "but sex lel" right? It's not just someone stating that they are attracted to short girls.  









 When I was 15, I met this girl in the lunch line at school. The first word she ever said in front of me were to a mutual friend about me; "Can you please get this girl the fuck away from me?" 

For me, it was love at first sight. It took six months, but I finally told her how I felt. She rejected me, but nicely, saying that if how she felt changed, she'd tell me.

Two months later, she said she liked me, too, but was afraid of ruining our friendship. Three days later, she finally changed her mind. That was October 10, 2010. By December we were picking out baby names. 

On Wednesday, it will be our 6 month wedding anniversary. I love this girl more and more every day. She's so great. 




 I wouldn't; he seems like a pushy dick. 




 I think whoever asks is expected to pay. I'm a lesbian, so there is no man. But for the people I know, the understanding is that whoever asks the other out is planning to pay. 




 Fuck yeah objectification! 




 Yay for you! Love comes in all kinds of packages. Enjoy your budding love.  




 My wife. She is just so lovely. She hugs and cuddles me when I need it and she is my hero. I love her so much. 




 You know this is a subreddit to make fun of neckbeard behavior, not flash it around, right? 




 Don't look at me, I voted for Kuzko.

 




 Caitlin Jenner is not brave, soldiers and kids with cancer are brave. Brave can only describe one person you see. 




 It's a cool place; and they say it gets colder  




 At that point you should just stand in the kitchen. 




 Woot woot! Congrats! 




 Okay? An adopted child may very well identify more with the culture of their family than their own "racial" culture. Surprisingly, though, race is a created concept. There is nothing to actually separate races. 




 Except you file your own tax return, not list it on your parent's. 




 It's a photo ID issue, not birth certificate. If you don't live in a city, IDs are hard to acquire. It requires that you have the time off when the DMV is open, you have to have transportation that you can afford with your day off to go to the DMV, then you have to remember to do it all again in a few years when it expires. 




 Hey there! My wife's mother is in fact Mother Gothel and my father is a hoarder who likes to threaten to kick us out! My dad and I got good now by us leaving for a few days. When he realized how much he needs us here to help, he got over himself. My wife is finally good with her mother by leaving. It hurts, but show her that you aren't afraid to cut her out. It will build respect. Also, remember that hoarding is a mental illness and she really can't help it in a lot of ways. Best of luck and pm me if I can help at all! 




 Are you just not a good candidate for a vback? I feel really bad for you that you can't have all the children you want. Are surrogacy and adoption out of the question? 




 If you don't mind my asking, how does the c-section keep you from having another baby? And I wasn't aware that the cord being wrapped could cause special needs. The more you know I guess. 




 I love my rodeoh boxer harness paired with a Maia suction dildo. So does my wife. 




 Even if his girlfriend were male it isn't relevant to the story. 




 I'm 20(f) and shop at Aeropostale (men's department) almost exclusively. The over branding has really gone down and the clothes are cheap and last and fit me well.  




 That really made me bust out laughing! 




 Makes transphobic comments, has a stupid username, I'd say that's an asshole. 




 My wife actually signed up to be a Mary Kay lady just for the bag of cheap stuff and that's the sunscreen I use now, it just isn't cheap. 




 I don't know how much i believe that sub. I post fairly commonly that I'm a woman and that I'm a lesbian and I have never received a creepy pm.  




 I got banned from r/feminism and they won't tell me why and from all related subs despite being a feminist. I also got shadowbanned last week because my wife upvoted me in trollx. 




 Russia isn't exactly the third world, bud. 




 But you don't have the temptation of Tinder 




 I think I understand what you meant; often straight, white, cisgender, Christian men are unaware. Our society us designed for everything to be perfect if you fall into those categories. That doesn't mean they are all unaware, but many are.  




 Not all men!!1!!!1 




 I hate when it's just number two. I don't sub fph for a reason. I hate when this sub circlejerks as fph Jr. 




 Did you even read what I wrote? 




 They carry it at my Dollar Tree! Try looking there next time you need it. 




 I am a big fan of turking which beer money recommends. That helps me fund mine, too. 




 I've had it my whole life on my arms. I use my face routine on my arms, but I exfoliate daily and use a lot of salicylic acid on my arms that I don't on my face. It's clearing up well. 




 One thing that, growing up, always dissuaded me from proper skincare was the cost. When you are poor, the investment is often too much to come up with, even though many products will last you a really long time. I have excellent skin to begin with, though it is very sensitive. I get hormonal acne when I ovulate and during my period, but mostly my skin has always been clear. I have created a guide for products that I've used and have seen work well but are low cost and not harsh on my sensitive skin. Obviously I'm not a dermatologist, so your results may vary.

**Spot Treatment**

**$1** [Acne Cream](http://www.dollartree.com/Acne-Cream-1-5-oz-Tubes/p346503/index.pro) as it is simply titled has worked great for me. It disappears and I add moisturizer over it and have never had any drying. It only costs a dollar and is available online at that link or at most Dollar Tree stores. 

^*Ingredients* ^Salicylic ^Acid ^(.5%), ^carbomer, ^cetyl ^alcohol, ^dimethicone, ^glycerin, ^glycol ^stearate, ^methylparaben, ^propylen ^glycol, ^propylparaben, ^squalane, ^triethanolamine, ^water

**Cleanser**

**$1** [Acne Wipes](http://www.dollartree.com/Premoistened-Acne-Face-Wipes-30-ct-Packs/p321467/index.pro) which are also simply titled are something I use once every other day. Also available from the link and Dollar Tree stores. 

^*Ingredients* ^Salicylic ^Acid ^(.5%), ^water, ^cetearyl ^Isononanoate, ^ceteareth-20, ^fragrance, ^cetearyl ^alcohol, ^glyceryl ^stearate, ^glycerin, ^ceteareth-12, ^cetyl ^palmitate, ^propylene ^glycol, ^methylparaben, ^disodium ^EDTA, ^propylparaben, ^2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1, ^3-diol

**1$** [Acne Cleanser Pads](http://i.imgur.com/6s6Nyaq.jpg) weren't listed on the website for Dollar Tree, but that is where I have purchased them. They are a bit stronger than the wipes and I use them when I have breakouts, still every other day, and when I'm in a rush.

^*Ingredients* ^Salicylic ^Acid ^(1.0%), ^alcohol, ^aloe ^barbadensis ^leaf ^juice, ^fragrance, ^polysorbate ^20, ^sodium ^chloride, ^tocopheryl ^acetate, ^water

**$6.47** [Equate Gentle Skin Cleanser](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Gentle-Formula-Skin-Cleanser-16-Fl-Oz/10417272) is used before either of the other two products, as neither are true cleansers. This is a generic version of the much raved Cetaphil product and is much cheaper and very effective. It also has the option of leaving it on your skin and not requiring a rinse. It's slightly expensive at $6.47 for 16 fluid ounces.

^*[Ingerdients](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Gentle-Formula-Skin-Cleanser-16-Fl-Oz/10417272#Ingredients)*

**Exfoliation**

**$2.97** [Equate Blackhead Clearing Scrub](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Acne-Medication-Blackhead-Clearing-Scrub-5-oz/10403006) is a product for under three dollars that works very well, including clearing up sebaceous filaments. It is a little harsh, and I can only use it every other day to every two days, but it works immediately and the effects last. It is a physical exfoliant and a lot of people don't like that, but I like this product. 

The ingredients are in the link.

**Moisturizing**

**$6.47** [Equate Moisturizing Lotion](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Fragrance-Free-Sensitive-Skin-Moisturizing-Lotion-16-fl-oz/10403103) is another product comparable to Cetaphil. When I first bought this, I hated it. It took me a while to learn that only a very small amount should be used, otherwise my skin was greasy and it was causing breakouts. Like it's cleansing cousin, it's a bit more expensive at about $6.50 for 16 fluid ounces. 

Ingredients are in the link.

**$6.27** [Equate Oil-Free Ultra-Gentle Facial Moisturizer](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Oil-Free-Ultra-Gentle-Facial-Moisturizer-4-fl-oz/37233433) is a smaller bottle for about the same money, but never left my face greasy no matter how much I used. It's a 4 fluid ounce bottle at about $6.25. 

Ingredients are in the link.

**Sunscreen**

**$1-$5** I generally just buy what doesn't eat my face from either Five Below or Dollar Tree. I used trial and error to find one for me, and it's baby sunblock. 

~

With the products that I use, I spend about $3.50 a month on skincare. I used poor lotion until I could swing the good stuff and it never really hurt me, other than learning that I'm allergic to Jergens but I only used it for three days. Dollar Tree carries moisturizer, but I've never tried it. If anyone has, please offer input. I built as I needed to, not everything at once. I hope this helps even one person to be able to take care of their skin on a budget. 




 It's a grandma thing to compare guns and cell phones. It's a grandma thing to be progun and anti cell phone.  




 I live 3 exits on 80 into PA. We're like next door neighbors! I frequently got called Teresa and I always have to spell "Tricia" out for people because they always want to spell it "Trisha" even though we all know "Tricia" is better. I hated being called Trish until I was like 14. I wanted Tricia. Now I don't care either way but I could never get behind anything but Trish for a nickname.  




 My understanding is that they usually figure it out by then. Though, if they don't the parent should definitely tell them. From what I've learned telling a kid too soon can be devastating and cause more problems. I guess it's all about finding a happy medium. 




 My mom picked Tricia because she specifically didn't want me to go by Pat or Patty. Since I'm a butch dyke she probably made the right choice in forcing me to have something about me be feminine. I don't know where you live, but I live in PA and a lot of transgender people I know changed their names for under 40 dollars.  




 I've heard that it's best to let a kid who is high functioning figure it out themselves. 




 Not that it excuses his behavior, but sometimes guys in their 30s react that way to fatherhood. Its scary for a 17 year old and they notoriously make poor decisions. Just love your boy and do what you can to fill that role. If the father doesn't want to be involved, your kiddo is better off with you and not him. Best wishes! 









 I'm also a Tricia; I just go by Trish. Are you a Tricia or a Patricia? I'm just a Tricia. 




 It's not really better that you left out the hash tag. Reddit isn't an advertising platform. 




 That was my perception of that post, too. 




 Hey there fellow Trish! 




 I think that's probably really good advice but I like food and hate exercise so I probably won't follow it lol 




 Construction workers.

Plumbers.

Urologist.

Since they are all gay I assume all female domestic abuse therapists, gynecologists, and daycare workers are all lesbians, since the adults they all typically interact with are women. 




 These signs make me really uncomfortable. My parents have been together forever and the idea of infidelity makes me literally nauseous.  




 Hmm... Could be a touch if each. 




 No! Omg I didn't even realize it could be read like that. No I wanted to discuss with her sex. Not discuss sex with her. 









 My brother always says that if God didn't want him to whack it he'd have put it in the middle of his back. 




 I didn't mean for this to sound so excited; I had just learned it and I get over enthusiastic about everything. 

My wife and I have discussed hysterectomy and once I have a baby we will probably take that route; my mom and maternal first cousin both had cervical cancer that left them both infertile (I was a huge thought to be impossible surprise after 16 years). I don't want to end up risking it, and my mom (who is my best friend) and my wife are all in agreement that that is pretty much the best route. 

I actually want all tissue removed. Any scar tissue is a heightened risk of breast cancer. I don't care if it isn't quite male looking. I am genderqueer and mostly just care about not wearing a bra. Regardless of the results and cost, I will eventually have a mastectomy to have all of the tissue removed. 

I don't want a positive result. Despite my planning to remove affected organs, I plan to have at least one biological child and I don't want to pass it along. I just like to have as much information as I can get ahead of time and I like learning from other people's experience. 




 If the whole point in having a kid is to be genetically related, you're doing it for the wrong reasons. 




 Medicaid is for everyone. Did you even apply? 

Edit: my information was apparently wrong. I learned in a social work class that it was for everyone; apparently it was meant that it *can* be for everyone. My 19 year old brother who is healthy as a horse also receives Medicaid. I wasn't aware that states could make restrictions beyond income. That's a disgusting thing. 




 Doing an AMA in al. :) 




 I appreciate that! That was very sweet of you. 




 Who seriously goes to a major corporate interview with green hair if the job isn't working for a cosmetic company? I love me some bright hair but I'd never go to a job interview like that. 




 I'm not a catiologist but that sounds like stress and it could be a blood clot. 




 I just hunted for the picture and damn boy! You look good! 




 If it's positive will they pay for top surgery? If it's negative will it be more difficult to get top surgery? I'm currently on Medicaid. I hope to have a baby before top surgery but if my wife is willing to induce lactation it's not vital that I do so; I just care that my baby is breastfed. 









 Some people can't and that's okay, as long as they don't adopt and subject a kid to that. It doesn't make someone a bad person not to have that ability. 




 Deleted 




 The worst part is is that the rational is that "Bruce" was her given name. Her given name was "William" and no one ever minded calling her "Bruce". 




 Adoption isn't faking it and not everyone has the ability to love an adopted child the same way. 




 NO ZOOBY IT IS THEY CANT TELL LIES ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB.

XOXOXO

 On the other hand, why should a kid in Tennessee get a worse education than one in New Jersey? They shouldn't and standards are the way to make that happen. 




 Not quite. He was animated from 1994 to 2008 and a live action version was reintroduced in 2008. I was so confused for a minute there; I was born in December  1994 and have vivid memories of Kool Aid Man Kool Aid commercials. 




 It takes courage to be open about who you are. Regardless of her shitty political position, she was courageous. At 65, when she likely has 20 years left, she announced something the world hates; that she is a transwoman. She was open about that fact despite all of the attacks she has faced.  




 That's probably why you were at 0 when I saw this. Jerks... 




 You're seriously advertising with a hash tag on reddit? Get a life. 




 Check out your local PFLAG group. Mine has great resources for our area and yours may as well. 




 Aww! Thank you! 




 The thread was kind of dead when I posted so I guess only transphobes were left and used it as a chance to downvote. 









 Sadly the downvotes were in trollx. I avoid default subs, especially anything having to do with human rights. 




 I started in the middle of my last final my freshman year of college. All over my fabric chair. I was done first and had no choice but to leave it. Happily, the chairs were all being thrown out that day because the campus was moving locations.  




 Same here. I have obvious ovulation symptoms but my period doesn't care about all of that. It comes when it's ready. 




 I was sort of on your side until this comment.  









 That place seems like the sort of wayward troll child of fph and trp.  




 I have had alterations with MRAs in there, too. 




 I think that's why we take leg beard as a compliment over there. If being a leg beard is wrong I don't want to be right. 




 I was in a conversation yesterday on there with someone from fph. They were basically laughed out of the comment section. 




 You're right. I was speed reading and usually came right before lite and confused me. Sorry bout that.
