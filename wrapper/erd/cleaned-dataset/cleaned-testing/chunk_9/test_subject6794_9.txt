 Thank you! I wasn't sure I would look good with that bright a color, but I went for it and I'm really glad with how it turned out. 




 Aww, thanks! 









 Thanks, haha. As you can probably tell this is something I'm pretty passionate about. 




 Alternatively, it could just as easily be that Tysha's mother served as a servant in the Lannister household, and that's where she heard the song. And as a Lannister servant, she named her child for her liegelord, even though they were unrelated. There's nothing really strong to say your theory isn't true, but there isn't really any strong evidence for it either. But it was certainly fun to think about. 




 No problem. Not many people use or even know the term, even in the LGBTQ community, and lots of people who are pan will tell people they are bi because it's easier and people will immediately know what they're talking about. Unfortunately that causes a cycle of people not knowing the term, so people don't use it to avoid confusion, so people don't know the term, and so on. But as someone who knows the pain of having to explain their identity over and over I get why they don't use it.

Edit: typos (auto correct is the name of my existence) 




 It somewhat depends on who you ask. But yeah, for some people the distinction very much matters. The main issue is that bi implies two and only two, which ignores people who are non binary. The term pansexual was coined to be more inclusive of people who are agender, third gender, gender queer, gender fluid, etc. Some people assume bisexual means you're attracted to people regardless of gender, which is definitely true for some bisexuals. But it isn't always the case - there are many bi people who aren't attracted to and won't date non-binary people or trans people. Also, using pansexual to refer to attraction to all genders opens up bisexual for those who are only attracted to 2 other than male and female - for example, some people who identify as bi are attracted to female and androgynous persons, but not males. 




 I think the biggest reason why most people associate PTSD with combat is that for the longest time, that's how the medical community understood it. The phenomenon was first observed in veterans from WWI, and at the time it was referred to as shell-shock. All these early associations were reinforced by later research. Most studies I have seen (quite a few as I'm in the field of psychology) use soldiers in combat or survivors of sexual assault as their participants. And most of the current knowledge we have of the disorder came from studying Vietnam vets. 

This has all been picked up by various media - countless books, movies, tv shows, comics, etc. reference PTSD from combat. And Hollywood is slow to move on, so while mental health professionals know that PTSD can be caused by any traumatic event, most laymen do not. 




 Fair, but I'll take "formulaic badass masculine guys turning out to be completely decent human beings" over the formulaic action hero who's a raging jackass any day. 




 Well, technically Iron Bull is canonically pansexual, but the distinction doesn't really matter in the comic. 




 That's not a bad idea. It would incorporate both my concepts nicely. I'll toy around with some sketches and see what I come up with. Thanks. 









 Even if the legal benefits weren't that big a deal (which there are many and they are definitely important), I would argue that it's still worth fighting for on principle. Even if you or any random LGBTQ person didn't *want* to get married, the fact that the law discriminates against them is wrong, in the same way that the Boy Scouts not accepting gay or trans leaders/members is wrong, or being fired from your job because you're transitioning is wrong. 




 There isn't really a "normal" for this sort of thing. It depends entirely on the person and situation. There's no definite point at which you can say you should be fine with it. 




 In any case, it might just be that OP needs more time to process. It took me years to resolve my anger, and it's still not completely gone. But it doesn't take the forefront anymore. 




 Speaking as someone who as abused by family members, I totally see your point, but you also have to consider that pushing someone to confront the person who abused them *before they are ready* can just retraumatize them and make things worse. Yes, it's true that when sexual assault goes unreported there is no possibility of justice. But seeking out that justice is also a long and difficult process, so we should try our best to be encouraging to OP without badgering her or guilting her into doing something she can't handle yet. I know that when people tried to tell me things I *had to* do when it came to dealing with my abuse it didn't really help me at all, only made me feel more anxiety and depression and all that awfulness. So just keep that in mind. 




 I'm pretty sure that if you go to the emergency room and report a rape, the standard procedure after a rape kit is to give you emergency contraceptives and a full std screening. Also there's a good chance (assuming OP is a minor) they would immediately remove her from living with her dad and place her under the custody of the state pending an investigation. So it would probably be a good idea to report. 




 That's probably part of it - the stubble stage is just so awful that I keep it short just to avoid that. But I imagine it's a lot like when you go from really short hair to longer hair with a haircut - when it's just long enough to stick to your neck it's awful. But once it grows out to your shoulders and you can wear in in a ponytail it's not so bad. 




 Sounds like your wife has my kind of sense of humor. I would totally do the same thing lol 




 I actually prefer to shave my pits because I don't like the feeling of armpit hair rubbing up against my shirts and stuff. But I totally don't judge anyone who prefers not to shave. It's just what I like.

As far as pubes and legs go, that doesn't bother me at all for some reason so I let that grow out. 




 I used to shave, not really often but I hated it. I prefer to use trimmers to keep it manageable and easier to clean my vulva. But otherwise I don't worry about pubic hair. Anyone who claims hairy genitals are disgusting is just being immature. Pubic hair is healthy - it's there for a fucking reason. There is nothing wrong with it.

(Not to say that people who do shave/wax/etc. should be ashamed of doing so, it's your choice so do whatever makes you feel good.)

My routine now is give it a trim about every 3 weeks or so. That way it's not too out of control, but I also don't have to worry about razor burn, cuts, etc. and it's not at all painful. 




 Thanks for the reassurance! This seems like a really nice and understanding sub and I'm really glad I found it.  




 Gotcha. Well I really don't understand why they're so against it, it makes less sense than your sister not wanting you to work there. Parents are weird sometimes though. /shrugs/ 




 That's good. Even if someone shouldn't associate with a friend, family member, or partner anymore trying to push them into it can just make things worse. They might stubbornly refuse just because they don't want to feel like they were forced into it, or out might stress them out if they aren't ready. 

Also I should probably clarify that I wasn't trying to get down in you or anything, it's just a really serious topic so I felt like I should give some weight to it. 

There most likely will be a tough transition period right after your boyfriend moves out. People like his dad tend not to respect boundaries and can really freak out whenever you start enforcing them. So be ready for that. But ultimately moving out will probably make him feel a lot better so there's still something to look forward to!

All that aside, your boyfriend is lucky to have you to support him through this and I hope you guys make it through okay. Give him my well-wishes and all the best to both of you! 




 Well I guess I'm the type of person who really values communication and even if it didn't change his mind, I would feel like it was unresolved if I didn't confront him about it. So that's just what I would do. But I suppose not everybody would care enough to. 




 As someone who was also watched in the shower as a kid (though not as bad as OP's fiance's situation), I can't stand clear shower curtains or glass doors because my abuser could look through them and they still make me feel really uncomfortable. I feel much better with a completely opaque curtain. So yeah, OP should definitely ask to see what she is cooler with. 




 That's actually really common. A lot of straight, macho guys have secret "girly" hobbies because it's tough to constantly project a super-masculine persona.

Also, being a cross-dresser doesn't automatically make your boyfriend gay or means he wants to be a woman, but it was probably good to clarify. 




 I think it's understandable that you would be surprised by this sort of thing and a little freaked out. This sort of situation is one that a lot of people are aware of but don't really think will ever happen to them.

However, I don't think this has to have a negative impact on your relationship. You clearly love him very much, and it's not as if crossdressing is bad or hurts anyone. It might be one thing if he told you he was secretly a serial killer or something, but honestly, what's the harm in your boyfriend wearing women's clothes sometimes?

Our society places a lot of pressure on guys to be super macho and manly and there can be some pretty serious consequences for anyone who doesn't conform to that. Men who don't live up to the ideal are called gay or pussy or whatever other nonsense, sometimes they're bullied or even assaulted by people who are just ignorant and hateful. So it's understandable that your boyfriend was afraid to tell you about this. But coming clean means he trusts you and wants you to love all of him. That says a lot.

I think you need to do a little soul-searching about this. Does the idea of your boyfriend crossdressing really bother you? Why? Are these good reasons to feel that way or ask him not to do it around you?

Honestly, it might help to view it as just another hobby, like how he goes fishing or hunting or working on cars. You might not necessarily be interested in those things, but that doesn't mean you can't still have a solid, meaningful relationship with him. I'm sure you have some hobbies or interests that he doesn't really get or particularly care for. And that's okay. You don't have to like everything he likes, or vice versa. The important thing is that you still love each other and support each other regardless.

Who knows, after the initial shock wears off you might find that it doesn't really bother you as much and you can help him shop for outfits or whatever. It would probably mean a lot to him. 




 If their only concern is that you are too young to be married, I wouldn't worry too much about it.

Every person is different, every relationship is different. Sometimes you just know when something feels right. And from what you describe, you guys sound like a really good fit for each other. You've known each other for years, you've lived together for years, and you don't plan on actually getting married for years. It's not like you rushed into this. You genuinely seem to enjoy each other and your relationship, so I say go for it!

Nobody but you can decide if you're ready for that kind of commitment, so if people are giving you a hard time because you're only in your twenties, take it with a grain of salt. Engagement, while important and a big commitment on its own, is not as final as marriage. You two have plenty of time left before you leave college, so you know it's not going to be official for a while. That gives you plenty of time to reconsider if you need to. So don't stress too much about it. 




 I would be more comfortable giving advice directly to your boyfriend about this, but maybe he doesn't reddit or isn't comfortable talking about it. So I'll address you instead as someone who is dating a person with family problems.

I've been in your boyfriend's shoes and yours. I've had to deal with a parent who just got so toxic and abusive that I had to cut them out of my life completely. I've also had a partner who had a parent that was toxic and abusive and is still in contact with them. So I can relate to you both.

I think the first thing you need to recognize is that whatever you might think, cutting off contact with his dad is ultimately your boyfriend's decision. Whatever he chooses to do, the best possible thing that YOU can do, OP, is to support him. Give him whatever he needs, be it the courage to stand up to his dad (although it sounds like he's already making progress there), someone to vent to when his dad does awful things, or helping him through removing his dad from his life. Regardless of what he decides to do he will need your help. This isn't a decision someone makes lightly, and it can be pretty terrifying.

The important thing to keep in mind is that your boyfriend has to do what is best and healthiest for him. Obviously his dad is really making things hard on him, so he should probably limit his contact with him at the very least. If he decides not to cut out his dad completely, you should be prepared for dealing with him and the emotional impact he has on your boyfriend for the long term.

If he does cut him off completely, he will most likely get an initial backlash from his dad. Whenever I first cut my abusive step dad out of my life, I got a flood of texts and calls, all hours of the night. Next came the facebook messages and email. When I ignored all those he started manipulating other family members into contacting me for them. He would tell my little sister to say that he really misses me; once his sister got in touch with me and tried to convince me to start talking to him again. It took a long while for no contact to actually result in no contact.

Another problem is that your boyfriend will probably have to deal with a lot of harsh judgement from others. One of the problems with abusive family members is that the abuser and the abused are sometimes the only ones who know about it or know the full story. A LOT of people have criticized me for making the decision I did to stop talking to my step dad. Sometimes they mean well, but none of them really knew what I was going through or fully why I chose to stop talking to him, so I know they're wrong, but it can still be really hard having people judge you for something like that. It takes a lot of courage to remove someone like that from your life, and it hurts when people misconstrue your choices and try to guilt trip you for them.

I hope some of this insight helps you and your boyfriend figure out what you both need to do. Also, if you would like some more specific support from people who have gone through this sort of thing, you should check out some other subreddits:

  He told me when we started dating that she was a lesbian. I didn't believe him because she's got a kid, come on.

Having a kid doesn't necessarily mean you aren't a lesbian. I've known people who came out as gay after years of denial and failed marriages with kids.

However, it sounds like your boyfriend told you Anne was a lesbian so that you wouldn't be jealous of him spending time with her. That's shitty and manipulative and completely unacceptable behavior. 

It isn't jealous or controlling or being insecure to want your partner to be honest with you and respect your feelings. Your boyfriend is not doing that. He lied about his best friend's sexuality so that you wouldn't suspect anything. He ignores your feelings and refuses to acknowledge anything is wrong. That is not a healthy relationship.

If I were in your position, I would confront him about this. It's not wrong to still be friends with someone you have a sexual history with - my fiance still talks to some of his exes and it's no big deal. But they've also set up clear boundaries and there is no interest to get back together. He also flirts with other women from time to time, which we've talked about and have established as okay. If he had feelings for or wanted something more with an friend, I would expect him to be honest about it and tell me how he's feeling, and if he chose to pursue someone else I'd be fine with that (but I'm poly so that might not be true for you). Instead, your boyfriend isn't even giving you the chance to talk about it - he tried to cover it all up from the get-go. That is a big, fat red flag. 

You need to talk to him about this. And don't let him just dismiss your concerns with "you're being insecure." It's not insecure to feel hurt whenever someone is misleading you and ignores you in favor of someone else. Ask him to explain what's really going on and why he's acting like this. And if he continues to disrespect you or you don't like his answers, dump him because he's not worth it. 




 I used to feel like that a lot, especially right after I got out of my abusive situation. But after a while I realized that I was spending so much energy being angry that was essentially wasted. Whether or not I am actively mad at my abuser, he's still going to be living his life completely unaware of my feelings. Being mad doesn't help me or hurt him. So instead I try to focus that energy on things that do help me. I do a lot of crafting stuff - origami, paper craft, knitting, crochet, cross stitch, etc. Whenever I get wrapped up in all the negative emotions I throw myself into something creative instead. Making things helps me feel good about myself and has even helped me make a little money, and that's much more worth my time than dwelling on anger.

I realize that setting aside those feelings is easier said than done. But you owe it to yourself to use your energy and time doing something good for yourself instead of wasting it on someone who isn't worth it. 




 [Indeed](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/fist_bump_shawn_gus_psych.gif) 




 I feel like I probably did at one point. But my trauma wasn't a single event in adulthood or anything, I was traumatized for years during childhood, starting at around 9 or so. If I was normal before then I don't really remember it, and all of my experiences since have been altered by that trauma. It's incredibly, profoundly unnerving to realize that you will never be normal and will have to carry your trauma around with you forever. I feel you. 




 I'd be willing to be a pen pal. I can certainly relate to struggling to express yourself to people and dealing with mental illness while living in poverty. PM me and we can exchange email if you like. 




 That's basically where I'm at with it too. At some point you just have to start prioritizing your own mental health above trying to make nice with people. Some people view that as selfish, I view it as self-preservation. 




 That's definitely a tough problem. I had to leave some stuff behind too whenever my parents got divorced and I moved away for college (for my own sanity). The stuff with my mom is fine, and I still talk to her, so I've had access to it. But the stuff that my step dad took I've chalked up as lost forever because I'm NC with him and his family and he's probably already sold it on ebay.

There might be some sort of legal avenue you can use to get your stuff back? Hiring a lawyer is obviously expensive but you could try talking to /r/legaladvice just to get an idea about what sort of options you have there.

Otherwise, you might be better off just trying to replace it. I personally wouldn't be able to emotionally handle asking for my stuff back from my abusive family members. I guess you just have to figure out if you're willing to deal with the emotional damage to get the possibility of regaining some of your possessions (because after all, even if you contact her there's no guarantee she'll cooperate in giving it back). 




 I don't really see it ending either. But I don't have the energy to fight people about it. So I mostly gave up doing that and I just nod along and give noncommittal answers whenever someone starts the "you should reconnect with your family" lecture.  




 There's probably some truth to that. My newer, closer friends all accept my NC as I'm pretty confident about it now, but when I was still LC with my step dad, I was confused and a little unsure about it. So I guess people probably picked up on that at the time, and people who weren't as close to me and didn't know the details would certainly misconstrue things and try to convince me to talk to him again. It also took me longer to recognize that my step dad was abusive, so when I told people why I was avoiding him at first I just said we disagreed about my NC with my brother. It wasn't until I realized that what my step dad was doing was abusive too and firmly decided on NC that my friends seemed to realize I was serious about it and the problem wasn't just one disagreement. Although, I still get crap from family and acquaintances who mean well but don't know what they're talking about. 




 Yeah, they are. But if I didn't have sex or another orgasm for the rest of my life I wouldn't really care. I don't seek it out, but if I happen to get it then that's cool. 

And it's okay, this is an AMA, I did this so people could ask questions they aren't necessarily comfortable asking someone in person. Although I've had people ask me about sex a lot so I'm also fairly used to it lol 




 Yes. I have an extremely low sex drive so I don't usually initiate sex. But I'm sex-neutral so I don't mind doing it. My main motivation is emotional rather than physical - I like being close to them, and making them feel good, so even though I could care less about getting off I still enjoy it. 

Not all asexual people feel that way, though - some of them are sex-repulsed (also called sex-averse) and don't like sex at all. Even the thought of it grosses them out o makes them uncomfortable. My opinion is more of a resounding "meh." 




 Nice! Pan-ace buddies! 




 I've been really fortunate in that both my partners are very understanding about it. But not everyone is accepting, so it can be scary. Hopefully though you can gain more confidence and have a successful relationship in the future, of that's something you want. Also, if you haven't already you should check out /r/asexuality.

Edit: I realized I didn't really answer your question. Most people I tell have never heard of any of this stuff, so my standard coming out experience is 20-30 minutes of explaining how asexuality works. It's a difficult concept for some people to grasp, for sure. I imagine it's a lot like telling people you grew up in a foreign country very different from theirs - people tend to have a lot of questions about how it works. 




 Not usually. If they ask for specifics I'll tell them but usually for the sake of brevity I'll say I'm queer, or just asexual. Honestly 99% of people I've come out to haven't even heard of asexuality so I'm usually stuck just explaining that concept, let alone the romantic attraction and non-binary gender. 




 The simple answer is, because I love them.

I don't feel sexual attraction, but I still feel emotional attraction. And I am very much romantically attracted to both my partners. For me, sex just isn't a necessary part of those relationships. 




 Hello, reddit! A lot of people don't know much about polyamory, non-binary people, or asexuality in my personal experience, and lots of people are curious. So if you'd like to know anything about my experiences as a member of any of these groups, here's your chance.

If you're unfamiliar with any of those terms, here are some basic definitions so we're all on the same page:

* [Polyamory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory): the acknowledgement that it's okay to have more than one sexual or romantic partner simultaneously. People who are polyamorous practice ethical non-monogamy - essentially, they don't limit themselves to one partner at a time with the consent of everyone involved.
* Non-binary: refers to people whose gender identity isn't strictly "male" or "female" but possibly neither or something in between.
* Panromantic: attracted emotionally or romantically to all genders/sexes.
* Asexual: does not experience physical or sexual attraction to any gender/sex.

So, if you have any questions about my sexuality, gender identity, or relationships, AMA! 




 Good luck! From what you've said about them they seem like nice people and I'm sure everything will work out okay. It might be a little awkward at first but hopefully you'll have just worried about it a lot for nothing! ;) 




 I'm 22 with PTSD and dysthymia. Honestly if not for the fact that my family is the reason I have PTSD I'd probably still be living at home until I got my shit sorted out too. Kudos to you for not letting people get you down. 




 I can definitely relate. Where I currently live I've been fairly open about being poly. I don't really bring it up with more casual acquaintances but all my friends know and most of them have met my two partners. But I haven't really told anyone from my home town except two very close friends. I really struggled on how to tell my family for a while. I opted to just tell my mom whenever I got engaged to one of my partners because she'd have to know eventually. It's really scary though. 

My best advice would be to try to weigh how much you want that person in your life versus how they might react. If you think they'll be supportive, or at least not that judgmental, great, tell them regardless of how close you are. If it's someone really close to you that you suspect wouldn't like it but you don't want to lose them over it, keep it to yourself.

A good way to find out who would be good to tell is to talk about poly people in general - for instance if you know other people in a poly relationship you can say to a friend "Oh, I heard so-and-so is going to the movies with their two partners and wanted to see if anyone else wanted to come" or something like that. If they are curious, you can have a conversation about it and tell them you're poly. If they don't seem to care, you can bring up your own partners casually at some point. And if they react negatively, you can reconsider their friendship. 




 That's okay - you shouldn't have to do it on your own. Humans are social creatures, we need help sometimes.

It's good to hear that you've decided to seek out therapy again. Honestly, there are some amazing therapists out there but there are some terrible ones as well. But even with good ones, they all have different specializations and counseling styles. Methods or therapists that work well with one patient or disorder won't always work for another. I always say that therapists are a lot like hair stylists - you sometimes have to shop around for one that cuts your hair just right, but when you find them you stick with them. 




 I'm so sorry this happened to you. That's a terrible thing to go through for anyone. You aren't selfish or weak for needing help or being lost and terrified. Honestly, your reaction to what happened is totally normal. Nobody should have to go through what you did, and no one would handle that sort of thing well. Part of healing is forgiving yourself and letting go of the guilt for not doing better than you are. It's okay to have these feelings. It's okay to be an emotional wreck when something so awful happens to you. The important thing to focus on is just trying the best that you possibly can, even if you mess up sometimes or don't make much progress. 




 That's totally reasonable. You should definitely talk to both of them about it. Maybe get them both together at the same time to talk to them about it - after all, it shows you respect both of them and their relationship. 




 I agree. It's not so much an issue of asking for permission to use her boyfriend. It's making sure that going after this guy wouldn't negatively affect their friendship. Obviously the guy is his own person and he's the one who ultimately decides whether or not to accept OP's offer of being FWB, but friends should take care of each other too. It's similar to how if you find out you and your friend have a crush on the same person - you talk to them about it to make sure things are okay with you and your friend so you can freely pursue your love interest without risking the friendship. 




 Omg yes. Using a trimmer is sooooo much better than a razor. No more ingrown hairs and razor burn!! 




 I didn't say OP shouldn't work, just that they didn't *need* to right now. Obviously if they really want a job they should go for it - like I said in my first comment, I think they should definitely apply for the job they want and even a few others. Like you said, it can potentially be a good experience for them. But I've also known quite a few high schoolers that try to get jobs ASAP because they really want the money, but end up hating it because they rushed into it. The combination of just starting high school, homework, after school activities, and a job eats up all their time and they wear themselves out. They just put too much pressure on themselves when it comes to managing all that stuff, and while it's important to take on new responsibilities when you're a teen, too much too fast can just end up hurting you in the end. So I wasn't trying to discourage OP from getting a job if that's what they want to do, just trying to point out that they don't have to be in a rush. 




 There's definitely nothing wrong with starting early. I mostly brought it up because if for whatever reason your parents won't let you get this job, at least it's not going to hurt you too badly. I would be more worried about getting a job as a sophomore or junior, because like you said you'll probably want a car and gas costs money. But there's also no reason you shouldn't get a job now, assuming that it doesn't interfere with school and whatnot. 




  your brother seems to have way more problems than just Aspergers. Just putting that out there because people that have Aspergers don't usually act like your brother does.

Agreed. Diagnosis is tricky sometimes, but honestly I have my suspicions that he also has a personality disorder or something. I know plenty of people who are autistic that, while lacking certain social skills (because autism), they are also genuinely nice people who try their best and treat people well. But Asberger's or no, my brother is a straight up asshole.

Unfortunately the fact that my brother is mildly autistic is also thrown in my face a lot when I tell people I don't like him. I've gotten a lot of flack from family members who say "well you should try to be more understanding because he has problems." Meanwhile, the abuse continues. Fuck that.

 When was the "but she's family!" slogan ever applied to you?

You know I'd never even thought of that, but you're totally spot on. Most of the time when people pull the whole "but they're family" crap I just respond with "yeah, but that doesn't mean they're good people for me to be around." You're right, though - it's completely illogical and unfair that other people excuse my brother or step dad and their abusive behavior because "they're family" but no one will stick up for me.

By the way, thanks for taking the time to write all this out. I really appreciate it. It feels really good to just be understood by someone. It's one thing when people aren't supportive of my decision, but even those friends and family who are supportive still seem like they don't really know how to respond when I tell them some of this stuff. I mean, they are obviously angry that I've had to deal with such awful family nonsense, but it usually just feels awkward because they've never been in that situation so they can't really empathize. But you definitely seem to get it, and your response was pretty much exactly what I needed to hear. You made me feel a lot better as I was reading it.

I also wanted to thank you for your well wishes! It really means a lot to me that despite all I've been through I'm slowly rebuilding my life and can finally achieve some happiness. And I am absolutely not budging about banning my brother from the wedding. Seriously, if he hears about it and shows up I'm calling the cops and getting him kicked out. Thankfully there are plenty of my friends who would stand up for me if he did try to crash it, so I'm not too worried about it. But if my mom hassles me about it I'll tell her she's not welcome. I don't need that drama. My wedding is supposed to be a day where I can be happy and celebrate with my loved ones, it is not a day where I want to have to deal with guilt trips and panic attacks. 




 Agreed. I think it really depends on the people. Yeah, sometimes dating or being friends with coworkers can make things complicated, but there are plenty of successful businesses run by couples, families, or groups of friends. 




 Honestly, I don't really see why a high school freshman really NEEDS a job that badly. Yeah, it's good to save money, but just for the sake of saving money? Not really necessary. I could see getting a job if you really needed the money for something but you're what, 14? 15? You could afford to wait a little while. But that's just my two cents.

However, your sister's reasoning is weak at best. You shouldn't even apply for a job because that might somehow affect her work hours? Wtf? No, that's a terrible reason for you not to apply. "No one else should work here so that I get more money" doesn't make any sense. It's selfish, and silly. You should apply to a job if you want it and if your sister has a problem with getting less hours, that isn't your fault (or anyone else's fault that they hire), that's on management. They're the ones who decide how many people to hire and how many hours each worker gets. If she doesn't like it, she can always try looking for another job - she's a few years older and with previous work experience she has a lot more job options than you do.

So I think you should go ahead and apply. Also, it might not be a bad idea to apply at a few different places if you can - you said that it's highly likely you'll get the job at the pool but nothing is ever guaranteed so best not put all your eggs in one basket. 




 It's hard being different, that's for sure. And I feel like the ideal partner not only loves you for who you are (including all your faults), but they also encourage you to be the best possible person you can be. I really hope you can find someone like that. 




 I haven't finished it yet, but I'm really enjoying it so far. I don't know if I'd say it's a better game overall than Origins, but it's definitely a much better follow up than 2 was.

Some aspects that have definitely improved are the romance options and diversity of characters. I'm really glad that there are more options for people to romance (characters that are straight, gay, bi, pan), more options for race (playing as a Qunari is awesome!), and they even included a trans character that is actually treated respectfully! It's a big step forward in gaming when AAA titles in huge franchises are so inclusive. 




 Poly is a really good option for a lot of ace people, I think. Assuming, of course, that all parties involved are okay with poly relationships. 




 I'm asexual, and I'm not on the autistic spectrum but I do have PTSD and dysthymia so I can relate to the need to find the "certain type of person" that will accept you the way you are.

I'm currently happily engaged to a straight man and we're living together. He's very accepting of both my mental illness and my orientation, and I couldn't ask for a better partner. So yeah, there are some positive stories out there. Don't give up hope, OP! 




 You should definitely find a rape counselor in your area as soon as possible. They can help your sister deal with the trauma and navigate the legal process if/when you decide to take any legal action against the ex-boyfriend, his friend who raped her, or the school. 

You should also look into getting her a therapist ASAP. Sexual assault is one of the biggest causes of PTSD (next to combat exposure), and the best way to avoid that would be to get her treatment as soon as possible. In any case, talking to a professional will help her process what happened to her in a hopefully more healthy way than she would on her own.

I hope your sister is okay, and my thoughts to out to her and your family. 




 It looks good! And cozy :) 




 No problem. Most people probably won't even bother reading my comment, but the biggest obstacle to the asexual community is just straight-up ignorance. Lack of knowledge makes things so much more difficult, not only from others who discriminate against us but from people in the community too. A lot of aces don't realize just how little knowledge there is out there. 




 My best advice is just not to sugar coat it. If you say "oh that's so nice of you but..." or "I'm flattered, but..." etc. it just makes a lot of guys thing "if I try a little harder she might say yes!"

If a guy keeps asking you out and you aren't interested, be very direct about it. Don't smile and give him pleasantries, just tell him flat-out "no." 




 I'm asexual and used to identify as demisexual, so feel free to ask me whatever! Also you should check out /r/asexuality for more folks who identify that way :) 




 Hello, all. I found this sub through r/raisedbynarcissists, but I don't quite fit in there so I'll tell my story to you all instead.

Just for general background info, I [22F] am the oldest of three kids. My mom [45F] had me when she was my age (horrifying thought), but her then-boyfriend [42M] didn't want to have kids. She wanted to keep me, and they ended up splitting. I don't really know a lot of details about this, my mom didn't tell me much other than explaining how sex works (to explain how I wasn't fully related to my siblings) and that my father had wanted an abortion and things just didn't work out. I had extremely limited contact with him as a kid because my stepfather didn't want me to see him. I spent a lot of time being angry at him for not wanting me when I was a younger, but when i got older I realized that at 19 I wouldn't want a kid either and couldn't really blame him for not being ready. In any case, I still don't talk to him often, but we have lunch occasionally and see each other on holidays now.

As for the family I was raised with, other than my mom and me there was my step dad [48M] who she married when I was three, as well as my half-brother [18M] and half-sister [13F]. We were fairly poor growing up, and we had a lot of issues. The house I grew up in was always under construction; step dad is a carpenter and renovated most of it himself after coming home from work. If any of you have ever done DIY renos in your spare time, you know how long that sort of thing can take. There were several years where we didn't have a functional kitchen, and I had to share a bedroom with my brother for a few years too. Even when I finally got my own room, it never had a doorknob - just a hole where the knob should go. I couldn't lock, or even properly close my door, as a young teenager. This is highly relevant to a lot of my problems later on.

I imagine this is somewhat uncommon, but my primary abuser was actually my younger brother. I've known people who were abused by parents, uncles/aunts, grandparents, older siblings, etc., but no one I've known has told me of being abused by a younger relative. This is possibly why a lot of adults that I tried to reach out to for help didn't really take me seriously. But for as long as I can remember, I have never gotten along with my brother. Being four years older, at first this was somewhat more manageable. There's only so much a three year old can do to a seven year old. However, I am and have always been small for my age - even now I only stand at a little over 5'2" (158 cm). So as we both got older, my brother started catching up. One of my biggest fears as a kid was of when he would finally get bigger than me. In elementary school I could outrun him, and I was physically stronger so I could hold a door shut if he tried to get in. In middle school, he was only a head shorter than me. In high school, he outgrew me. It was no longer so easy.

My brother has always had mental health problems, and often acted out. He has an explosive temper, and was suspended or in detention almost every year he was in school for getting violent. He's also gone through a range of tentative diagnoses, from ADD, ADHD, ODD, to name a few. Most recently, he was officially diagnosed with Asberger's and GAD (General Anxiety Disorder, related to the autism) after being admitted to the psych ward at a children's hospital two years ago. He made things very difficult for my parents, and my sister, but most of his anger was directed at me. Because we were closer in age and interests, I went to the same school for a while, rode the bus with him, I was left alone to watch him while my parents were at work, and I had to share toys with him sometimes.

I was also the only person in our immediate family who didn't cave in to his every demand. My step dad and his family all spoiled him to keep him happy, while my overworked mother would appease him to get him to stop throwing tantrums or just ignore us. I didn't have the patience for that bullshit, so rather than feed his narcissistic ego I would stand up to him and call him out for his nonsense behavior. And he punished me for it. Every pair of glasses I had from middle school through high school was broken because he hit me in the face, threw something at my head, or once tore them off my face smashed them into the ground with his fist. He would swear and scream at me, punch me, and throw things at me if I did even the slightest thing to make him mad. After I got my own bedroom, my door was covered in dents and scratches from where I had to run and hold it shut while he tried to force it open by punching, kicking, or even using a bat or metal chair (all while I had no knob, remember?). There was also a few months right around the time that I was 13 that he would try to peek at me whenever I took a shower. That went away after a while, but later when I was in college he started to sexually harass me on purpose to make me uncomfortable.

Things only got worse and worse as we got older. When I was much younger I would sometimes get into arguments with him, and even provoke him, because I was upset. But that was when I was 9 and 10 years old, very immature. By high school I knew better, and I didn't actively seek out fights. I mostly kept to myself to avoid them. But by that point he didn't need much to set him off. Being around him was like trying to negotiate a minefield; you never knew which wrong step would cause the explosion. One tiny comment or word he didn't like, even if it wasn't to him or about him, and he would fly into a rage - sometimes for hours. This continued after I left for college. Whenever I came home to visit, one tiny thing I did wrong that would at most make a normal person mildly irritated or merely start a discussion would make him so mad that he threatened to kill me on several different occasions. Once he even actually tried to do it - he chased after me with the broken off end of a gardening steak and tried to stab me. I can't count how many times I had to call up my best friend or boyfriend to come get me so I could escape.

It was around that time that my mom and step dad got divorced. My freshman year of college she moved out and rented a new house, and they got split custody. My siblings would spend one week with mom, then one with their dad. I was already 18 at that point, so I could go wherever I wanted. That was usually with the parent who didn't have my brother and sister for the week. I really missed my sister and felt horrible about not spending more time with her but I just couldn't deal with my brother anymore.

This was also the time when I started to limit contact with my step dad. He was and still is a (barely) functioning alcoholic, and is in severe denial about his own problems, let alone my brother's. He is very emotionally/verbally abusive toward me. Where my brother would shout nasty things just to be nasty, it was my step dad who had the truly abusive mentality. Whenever I got into a fight with my brother, regardless of who started it or why, I was the one who was reprimanded and punished because "you're older and you should know better." After I cut off contact with my brother, my step dad would constantly guilt trip me about it. Whenever my brother was committed my step dad called me at 3 AM in the middle of finals week to tell me about what happened. Then he proceeded to ramble on about how I was a horrible sister, my brother just wanted me to love him, why couldn't I be more supportive, my sister misses me and doesn't understand why I don't want to see her, blah blah blah. By the end of the conversation I was in tears.

I quickly grew tired of my step dad constantly nagging me to spend more time with my abusive brother. He refused to help him get treatment or take his medications, too. He consistently denied that my brother ever did anything wrong, even when he literally had to pull my brother off of me because he went ballistic and started punching me after I disagreed with him about something. After that my step dad didn't even ask if I was okay, even though he'd just seen me get punched in the head and chest multiple times. He just yelled at me for making my brother upset. After so many times of hearing that it was my fault, that I shouldn't have made him angry, that I should be a better sister, that nothing was wrong, I had enough. I cut him out of my life and haven't looked back.

Of course, many people who I assume are well-meaning have tried to convince me to give my step dad and brother a second chance, saying that "they're you're family!" and I should repair my relationships. Thankfully, my mother has a very low opinion of my step dad and has no qualms whatsoever about me ignoring him and his awful behavior. However, even she seems to think I should reconcile with my brother, but I just don't see that happening. Because of the abuse I went through I developed PTSD (and I was also diagnosed with dysthymia). I am not about to go near the source of my trauma. Nope. I recently got engaged and told her I don't want him at the wedding, but she and her current husband [45M] don't seem to get why. I'm a little worried that my insistence on keeping away from my brother and step dad will cause problems in my relationship with my mom - it's already happened to several other family members. But hopefully I can convince her to see reason.

Well, that's my story. It's a little long, and honestly there are so many more things I could talk about, but I won't go into them here. Thank you for reading. I guess what I want more than anything is for people to stop telling me that I should make nice with my step dad or brother, and just know that I didn't cut them out of my life flippantly or for no good reason. I'm not trying to be spiteful. I had to do this for my own health and safety. I just wish people could understand that and show some sympathy rather than judging me or assuming they know my situation better than I do. I've had relatives, teachers, friends, church members, even court lawyers try to tell me that I'm wrong for not wanting toxic people in my life. And even though I know that what they say ultimately doesn't matter because I made the right choice, it's still nice to get encouragement from others. :( 




 It would most likely be the cartridge. Other ds games work on my 3DS just fine. 




 I especially like that she lists off a bunch of potentially more harmful or destructive pranks, then after thinking about it she goes for the subtle annoy-you-to-the-point-of-insanity one instead. 




 I was really glad they included that, too. Although they did mention some of the problems Templars face in the first game - Alistair complains about it a lot and says he's glad he ended up with the Wardens instead - it's never really done to make them appear sympathetic. 

We feel bad for the mages because they can't help being born with magic, and they're locked up our hunted down regardless of what they want. So any negative feelings that mages show toward Templars are seen as justified, because their survival is on the line. But the Templars *chose* to join their order, and a lot of them are clearly biased and hateful toward mages, so it appears less justifiable. Plus, they're heavily associated with the Chantry, an organization that is problematic at best. 

It's really hard for the player to identify with someone who willingly joins a corrupt religious body that starts campaigns of genocide on the flimsiest of justifications, forcibly imprisons or lobotomizes people they deem too dangerous, and controls its followers through indoctrination and chemical addiction. Considering how hard it is to separate faith in a deity from faith in a church, anyone who joins the Templars is presumably devout and also approves on some level of the Chantry's actions (and is most likely complicit in them).

But what the player knows isn't necessarily what the characters in the game world know. That's why I've really enjoyed seeing the character arcs for Cassandra and Cullen. Not only do we get to see a lot more of the dirty secrets the Chantry has kept from the public, but we start to see more of a divide between doctrine and its followers. In Origins, the Templars and the Chantry were heavily conflated. But as the series progresses, we see that the Templars were also victimized by the Chantry's policies, not just perpetrators against the mages. Indeed, if everyone had the knowledge Cassandra later discovers, or even just the knowledge most Templars like Cullen or Alistair have, the Chantry would most likely lose a lot of support and people wouldn't follow so blindly. 




 I actually have the DS version, but I never got around to playing it because my 3DS can't read it and I lent my DSlite to my fiance a while back so he could play Ace Attorney. I'll have to dig it out sometime though. 




 I'll second that. If you like Ace Attorney, odds are pretty high you'll like Dangan Ronpa. I haven't played Ghost Trick yet but it's in my to-do stack. 




 Unfortunately, there is no magic advice that will help you out here. You just have to do what is best for you and hope that everything works out okay.

I can definitely understand why you would be worried about gf A's feelings. You've connected with her and had a relationship for a significant period of time. It's tough to think that such a big part of your life might come to a close. And there really isn't a way to do that without hurting someone's feelings.

It sounds to me like you do know the answer. You should probably break up with A. B seems like a much better fit for you personally. I think it's important to remember that not all relationships end because you don't like someone, and you shouldn't consider a breakup as a failed relationship.

If you really feel like you aren't getting what you want out of your relationship with A, then odds are she probably isn't that satisfied either. But in any case, you should talk to her about this. Tell her the doubts you're feeling. Tell her about the exhaustion you've been going through and the hard time you've had keeping up with the different interests and schedules. And tell her that even though you do love her, you don't feel like this is a good fit. Yes, she will probably feel hurt - that's normal when a relationship doesn't work out. But if you explain your feelings to her she'll probably understand. And if you both still care for each other, it is possible that you can still have a positive relationship with her afterward. It'll just take some time. 




 That's awesome! I'm glad you got help and you're doing better. You deserve to be proud, that's a huge accomplishment! :D 




 Yep. And there are still only a few other studies that have been done to corroborate it. This is a super new field. 




 FYI that was one year after the first published study on asexuality. This is not at all shocking. 




 People who are "that way because of a low testosterone level" aren't necessarily the same as people who are asexual because that's their orientation.

As for folks who wish they were different, it's not them being asexual that's the problem - it's the way they are treated *because* of their orientation that's the problem.

To illustrate this, someone who belongs to a minority religion might have behaviors related to their particular religion that are outside the norm, or cause suffering in their daily lives (e.g. fasting). But religions minorities often face discrimination from those outside their religious group; I'm sure there are more than a few Muslims in recent years who have had a hard time dealing with Islamophobia in the post-9/11 U.S. They might even occasionally wish they weren't part of that religious minority so they wouldn't have to deal with intolerance all the time. However, we wouldn't classify these people as having a mental disorder for being part of that religion. Instead, it's fairly obvious that the only reason they feel bad is because other people treat them in a hateful manner for having that religion. 




 (Speaking as someone in the psychology field who is also asexual. I apologize for length.)

The short answer to your question is yeah, being asexual is a sexual orientation, not a mental disorder. However, it can be confused for a mental disorder known as HSDD (hypoactive sexual desire disorder), which is what your textbook is likely referring to. If you want to know more about all the controversy surrounding this issue, check out this link [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/18/asexual-disorder_n_3361472.html?1371562287).

A lot of the medical community's treatment of asexuality is rooted in the issue that there isn't much known about it from a scientific standpoint. Yeah, we have the X in Kinsey's studies from the 1960s, but the presence of asexual individuals in research studies were written off as a statistical anomaly for most of psychology's history. The first paper to be published on the prevalence of asexual orientation that actually recognized it as a legitimate orientation was in 2004.

That's right - asexuality research is barely a decade old. That is NOTHING to science. So it's not that surprising to have issues with misdiagnosis with a field still in its infancy.

Back to HSDD. This disorder developed out of the original diagnoses of "impotence" in men and "frigidity" in women (obviously a flawed concept). In the DSM-IV-TR (the version before the most recent DSM 5), it was defined based on three categories:

* Persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity. The judgment of deficiency or absence is made by the clinician, taking into account factors that affect sexual functioning, such as age and the context of the person's life. 
* The disturbance causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. 
* The sexual dysfunction is not better accounted for by another Axis I disorder (except another Sexual Dysfunction) and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition. 

Not having much or any sexual desires or fantasy describes a lot of asexual people, so that's criteria one. And although most asexual people aren't inherently bothered by this lack of desire, it does often cause issues with interpersonal relationships, meeting the second criteria. And it's fairly safe to say the a vast majority of us aren't asexual because of medication side effects or sexual dysfunction, meaning a good number of asexual people would meet all the necessary criteria for a mental disorder.

On the other hand, many asexuals don't experience undue stress due to their orientation, nor does it necessarily serve as an obstacle to their daily life or relationships in a way that would be considered clinically significant. To put this another way, there are plenty of people who might be sticklers about organizing things in a specific way, but that doesn't mean they have OCD. In the same vein, jut because an asexual person doesn't have much interest in sex doesn't mean they have a disorder either.

After protests and reviews of the DSM-IV-TR criteria, the DSM 5 criteria were changed:

 All of the DSM-5 sexual dysfunctions (except substance-/medication-induced sexual dysfunction) now require a minimum duration of approximately 6 months and more precise severity criteria. ... DSM-IV included the following subtypes for all sexual disorders: lifelong versus acquired, generalized versus situational, and due to psychological factors versus due to combined factors. DSM-5 includes only lifelong versus acquired and generalized versus situational subtypes. Sexual dysfunction due to a general medical condition and the subtype due to psychological versus combined factors have been deleted due to findings that the most frequent clinical presentation is one in which both psychological and biological factors contribute. To indicate the presence and degree of medical and other nonmedical
correlates, the following associated features are described in the accompanying text: partner factors, relationship factors, individual vulnerability factors, cultural or religious factors, and medical factors.

So what does that mean excluding psychology jargon? Honestly ... not much. The "lifelong" subtype is going to probably describe a lot of aces, so we're still technically considered part of a mental disorder. BUT on the upside, we're getting more precise with these diagnoses, which means that medicine is starting to distinguish between people who have a genuine psychological problem and those who are experiencing a normal part if the diversity that is human sexuality. We're slowly starting to change people's minds about this stuff. But again, this research is only 11 years old. As more research is done and more people begin to understand asexuality, the more likely we are to see more positive changes.

TL;DR - fuck you, this is my degree. Let me blab on a bit. 




 I don't feel guilty, just generally bad because being triggered is not fun. My fiance feels really guilty that he triggered me, though. I probably should have been more clear on that. 

And yeah, communication is super important. I couldn't talk about it right away because I was too busy freaking out but I made sure to explain what happened as soon as I calmed down, and he totally understood and was very supportive. 




 I don't blame myself for it, it just kind of sticks in general. He is a really good guy and he cares about me a lot, which is why he really feels bad when he triggers me (this is only the second time it's happened). I suppose it really bothered me because like I mentioned in my post this was the first time I was triggered by that particular situation and it's like "well there's one *more* thing I have to avoid." 




 Which ones are you confused about? Because I understood all of it and I am willing to explain various jargon 




 If you're looking for fluffy bl, try The Boy With Pink Ear Muffs. It's a pretty cute web comic.

Edit: duh, I'm sleep deprived. Go to /r/queercomics. It doesn't get much activity but there are plenty of posts with good recommendations 




 Maybe you should point out to your mom how the statistics on eating disorders show they are some of the most difficult mental disorders to treat and the most likely to result in death. Then she might take you seriously. 

I think that you should absolutely look for support from somewhere else if you're not getting it at home. Maybe you should reach out to a close friend? You might have better luck there. It's a lot easier to recover if you have social support. And of course you can still try to talk to your parents again later, but you should find someone else to help you out in the mean time. 

I would also highly suggest seeking out therapy. A support group might help too. 




 If it's a few hours before that makes sense then lol. You have plenty of time to chill after and you'd be tired by bed time. Also it's a lot healthier than other options like drinking yourself to sleep or something. 




 I've heard it's bad to work out before sleep because the adrenaline and endorphins actually wake you up. But then again I'm no sleep expert lol 




 Hello all. I recently found this sub and I can't sleep so maybe posting this will help. I know you all will likely be a sympathetic audience. 

Just a warning, I'm going to talk about things of a sexual nature that triggered me and, although rather mild, might also trigger other people.

Earlier today my fiance got home from work and we took a shower together. I finished drying off and went to our bedroom to get dressed before he did. About a minute later he came in while I was still only in undies. I had the door closed, and he suddenly burst in without knocking. It startled me pretty bad. 

My abuser used to do the same thing to me when I was just hitting puberty. He would try to catch me naked or shirtless after a shower, by peeking through my door (it had no knob at the time) or just bursting into my room or the bathroom suddenly so he could see my breasts.

The last time it happened was about two years ago. I was alone with him in the house, but hadn't seen him at all since he was in his own room playing video games. I figured it was relatively safe because it hadn't happened since I was 13 or so (I'm 22 now), but just in case I went to my mom's room to take a shower. Hers had its own attached bathroom, so I could change in her bedroom and not have to go in the hallway. Plus, there would be two locked doors between us. 

But I was wrong. I didn't notice anything wrong when I was in the shower, but I came out to him laying on the bed, lounged in what was supposed to be a sensual position, and he was only wearing his underwear. He told me some pick up line that I don't remember (other than it being terrible). I thought that particular nightmare was over, but there I was, standing in nothing but a towel, with my abuser coming on to me. 

I asked why he would do such a ridiculous thing and he openly admitted it was only to mess with me. He was doing it for a power trip, a bit of a joke. And because he enjoyed how clearly uncomfortable I was, he refused to leave. I even threatened to call the cops, but he mocked me, saying go ahead, what good would that do. He was right. I thought to myself that the cops would most likely do nothing. By the time they got there, he would leave, we could both get dressed, and there was no proof anything had even happened except my word. 

I settled for calling my mom instead, who told him to leave me alone and said she'd handle it when she got back home from work. Nothing really came of it. Except my further trauma, of course. 

Back in the present day, I got all flustered after my fiance came into the room unexpectedly. I could feel myself on the edge of a panic attack, so I just focused on getting dressed and then fiddled with some origami I'd been working on until I could calm down some. A little while later on the way to dinner I talked to my fiance about it and he said he would knock from now on just in case. 

I feel awful now. I've never been triggered in relation to that particular trauma before - in fact, I always considered those events the least awful thing my abuser did to me. But my fiance is now feeling horribly guilty, and I'm going out of town for the weekend so my last experience with him before I leave is now tainted by my PTSD. This sucks. 




 I'm so sorry you had to go through all that. But you aren't alone. And now you have a name for your problems, which is a good start. 
I also remember thinking "then what would happen?" So many times as a child I scraped together my pocket change and thought about running away. But what if my parents called the police? What if I ran out? Then what would happen? It is a horrible thought for a child to have to think. 




 I wish more of my friends were into knitting and crochet. A good portion of my friends are into crafts, which is awesome, and a few of them either knit or crochet (almost never both) but none as much as I do. Most of them don't have the time to start or only just learned but I've been knitting for 7 or so years and seriously crocheting for a little longer but started when I was a kid. If I even use a little jargon they get totally lost. It's fun to teach people but it would be nice to have one or two people who know at least as much as I do. 




 I'm going to respectfully disagree with you, here. Like I mentioned before, I took care of all the necessary stuff myself. I've been paying for school, rent, utilities, groceries, etc. with no help from any parent for the last two years. I haven't always been able to find work but it's not like I'm not trying or unwilling to do so - as evidenced by doing landscaping, which is definitely hard work.

Being absolutely 100% self-sufficient does not make you an adult, being able to maturely handle situations does. I've known plenty of adults who have had to ask their family for help from time to time, but that doesn't mean they still aren't respected and treated like adults by the family members who help them. 

Like I said, the ONLY thing she paid for was my phone and my insurance - the insurance because it's law where I live that full-time students are covered under their parents until age 26, and the phone because that was just the last thing I ended up sharing with her since we were on a 2-year contract. She stopped paying for my phone in September and my insurance in December of last year so right now she doesn't pay for anything. Meanwhile, many of my peers still live in dorms and/or live with their parents, so having one thing paid for isn't that much in comparison. And yes, I understand that my mom is older and more experienced than me, but she and her husband treat me like I'm still 14 and have no idea how the world works, despite having lived on my own for more than two years. THAT'S what really bothers me.

Also, whether or not you consider my reasons for not being completely self-sufficient as valid doesn't make them less so. If you've never had to deal with poverty and chronic mental illness with almost zero social support, I'm happy for you, but you also can't really say that I'm not doing the best I can with what I've got.

Thanks for your congratulations, I'm really glad that pretty much everyone agrees that I should choose who I invite. That feels really validating. 




 I'm aware of it. I don't really consider my mom a narcissist, though - I just think we have some communication issues, mostly. Like I said, we were never that close to begin with so we just don't understand each other about a lot of stuff.

I will check it out through, just to see if there is any helpful pointers. 




 Well, like I said, we sorted out the whole phone issue, I just didn't go into detail about it. I eventually had a talk with her (that was honestly closer to a fight) about how much I was struggling financially and she let it go. So yeah, she hasn't paid for my phone since September, and stopped bugging me about it around October. It hasn't really come up since, I mostly mentioned it to give context to the situation.

There is a good chance she's just been spending too much money lately, but honestly that's her problem not mine. And I have no idea what her finances are like, but if she's that hard up for cash she has plenty of stuff to sell/pawn, it's not like she really NEEDS that $30 bucks from me - part of why it really got to me so much.

I do plan on having my wedding my way (within reason of course, I'm not a bridezilla or anything), and I'm not gonna cave to my mom about something that important, I'm more worried that it will start a fight because I refuse to invite my brother, which is stupid.

I have essentially done what you said - I no longer associate with him. I've also put to rest most of my animosity toward him, so it's not like I'm holding onto anger against him or trying to be petty. I'm just focusing on my own health right now, and that means staying away from him. I did seek counseling originally through the university, but my therapist moved to private practice so I saw her privately. She's the third therapist I've seen about this stuff and I would like to keep seeing her as she's helped me progress a lot and I feel like switching back to free university services would just be more hassle than it's worth. Fortunately, my fiance is able to help pay for my therapy, so I'll be going back as soon as possible.

Thanks for your advice! 




 Thank you! I'm glad I'm not the only one who sees that as a reasonable decision. And no, I certainly would not invite him for my mom's sake. Don't worry, I'm standing firm in that one. 

As far as where she was? I know she's seen more than a few of the bad incidents between us so that's part of why I'm so at a loss as to why she doesn't get it. The only thing I can think is that she just somehow doesn't realize HOW BAD it is. That's why I asked her to read up on PTSD. 




 Thanks! Maybe it will help be grow taller like Merry and Pippin haha 




 I've been on both sides of that scenario. When I first opened up my relationship with my first partner, it was so that he could date other people. I technically could see other people too, but didn't have an interest in doing so for a long time. More recently, I'm engaged to a different partner, and while I am poly he is totally mono (but okay with me being poly obviously).

One thing I can tell you is that it's perfectly normal to not know how to deal with nonmonogamy at first. It's not something a lot of people are ever even brought up to believe is an option, so you'll probably need a little time to adjust. During that time, it might be hard to figure out what you should be feeling or how you should act, and that's okay - the important thing to remember is that there isn't one specific right way to do be in a nonmonogamous relationship, you just have to find what works for you.

I felt weird at first whenever my first partner talked about his other relationships, too. He's had about half a dozen or so more casual dating partners other than me, and it was sometimes hard for me to hear him constantly talking about all these other people. For me the issue was that whenever he got down about another date not going well and felt bad because he was feeling "unlucky in love" so to speak, it made me feel like my role was diminished. Sure, he might have struck out with someone else, but I was still there, so how was he unlucky? But at the same time I had to remember that my relationship was separate from his other relationships; the status of ours did not detract or add to the status of the others and vice-versa.

It's possible that you're just feeling a little jealous. The best thing to do in this case is to acknowledge your feelings for what they are, and talk to your partner about them. An important part of any nonmonogamous relationship is healthy communication. So talk to your partner, and see if you can both work out a way to make you feel more comfortable. 




 Agreed, I like to be surprised occasionally lol 




 To be fair, though, even if you do report there's no guarantee that anything will come of it. Speaking as someone who was abused by a family member, not everyone believes you, and even if they do there isn't always much they can do about it unless there are witnesses/solid evidence. Going through a police investigation and trial are really stressful, not to mention that doing so might push the abuser to retaliate violently. On top of all that, OP's friend is most likely a gay (possibly bi) dude, which means that he has to face double discrimination as a male abuse victim and as a queer person. I can totally understand why he wouldn't want to press charges in favor of just moving on with his life. 




 Hey all you beautiful people out there. I wasn't sure what sub to post this in, because it could easily to to /r/Advice or /r/relationships or somesuch, but I decided on you all since you're generally a pretty supportive bunch (and I like this sub better anyway). I wanted a little help figuring out how to deal with a predicament I'm in. I'm not sure what to do here and I'd appreciate some fresh perspective.

I've had a hard time dealing with my mom lately. We were never super close to begin with for various reasons, but our relationship had improved since I started college. Then about a year ago, there started to be friction again due to some money issues. I'm a full-time student and I have PTSD and dysthymia. The pressure from getting two degrees alone is nearly breaking me, so I don't really have the capacity for a job on top of school. Despite that, I applied to a lot of places, but to no avail. I just don't have enough experience for any of the places I've applied and my options are limited since I can't work on campus (no work study) and I don't have a car (so I have to stay close).

Despite this, my mom started to pressure me to give her money to pay for my share of the phone bill. At the time I was on her family plan, but besides insurance it was the only thing she paid for - I had to cover my own tuition, fees, books, school supplies, electronics, rent, utilities, etc. using loans, grants, and scholarships. Money was tight for me, but she constantly hounded me to pay for the phone. And the price kept going up - January she said she wanted $10, then later it was $15 a month, and by May it was suddenly $30. By the way, I never actually saw the phone bill, so I have no idea how much my line actually cost. I didn't have data, just talk and text, so it was probably a very small portion of the bill since the rest of the family all had smart phones.

Soon, every time she called the discussion ended up centered on money. I could barely make ends meet but she just HAD to have that $30 because she was apparently on a tight budget. She is a registration manager at a hospital and her husband is some kind of accountant, I think. They're not loaded, but they make decent money - enough to pay for a new 3D TV, Coach purses, a honeymoon in the Bahamas, etc. Meanwhile, I have to struggle to get bills paid and eat. I even had to stop going to therapy because I couldn't afford the $40 copay per session once a month. The only reason I made it through last summer without having to borrow money was because I got a job being paid under the table to do landscaping, and even then I only managed to scrape by and had to quit once school started again.

I should also mention that last May I started seeing someone, and we really hit it off. I was pretty much head over heels for this guy two months in, but I didn't want to talk to my mom about it because I didn't want to bring up my new boyfriend right after having a fight about money for the hundredth time. I never did pay her, and she eventually just turned off my phone. So I went on a new plan with my boyfriend. Then every conversation after that became "where's my money" AND "who's paying for your phone" which I didn't want to answer because it always felt like an interrogation. I should have told her about him, but I was too stressed out over the phone and it never felt like a good time.

Eventually we got that sorted out and last month my boyfriend proposed. I said yes. Seeing as how we were now engaged and I hadn't fought with my mom in a while (although it was still a little shaky), I decided I should probably tell her about my fiance sooner rather than later. I gave her a call, and we made plans for us to come visit her for lunch (my mom lives about 1.5 hours away).

The visit started off okay - they asked him a bunch of questions, and they seemed to really like him. But it soon turned sour when my mom and her husband started making some rather condescending or downright rude remarks. The husband doesn't like our wedding theme (Lord of the Rings), Mom doesn't like my hair (I have it cut very short and style it masculine, but so what I'm queer and I like it). The kicker, though, was when I told them I refused to allow my brother (who abused me and caused my PTSD) to my wedding. They seemed astonished I would say such a thing, and tried to tell me I needed to sort out my issues with my brother. I had to really bite my tongue to avoid starting a fight. My fiancee tried to stick up for me because he could tell a lot of the stuff they said made me upset, but they talked over him a lot. I just tried my best to change the subject to more neutral topics, and we left a few hours later.

I couldn't just let what they said go, however, so I wrote my mom an email to try and explain that she had upset me and why. I tried to be as polite as possible, while still being firm about my opinions. Basically, it boiled down to this:

* When you and your husband talk to me, I feel like you're treating me as if I'm still a child and I don't know how to take care of myself, but I'm an adult (22 years old) and I DO take care of myself, so I would like to be treated with more respect and compassion.
* I like my hair the way it is because it gives me confidence and it makes me feel like I look good. I don't feel like I look good nor do I have confidence while wearing most feminine clothing or hair styles. I don't need you to tell me that having a "boy hair cut" will make it hard for me to get a job because it might leave a bad impression during an interview - I know how to dress for an interview. I deal with queer-hate on a regular basis, so I know how people see me when I wear my hair a certain way. I don't need you to tell me that, I live it.
* PTSD is serious; I'd like for you to try to learn about it and understand it more. Please do not give me shit about not inviting my brother to my wedding. Why would I want my abuser at my wedding???

On Feb. 5th my mom texted to ask me about something unrelated, and mentioned she had gotten my email but was taking a while to send one back because her response was already several pages long. As of writing this, I STILL have not gotten an email back from her. Now I'm starting to worry that I said something wrong, or that she took something the wrong way, or that I'm going to end up starting a fight with her over this stuff. The longer she goes without responding the more I start to worry.

So what do you all think? Was there something better I could have done? Should I try to talk to my mom about the email? Should I just wait patiently for her response?

**TL;DR - My mom and I have been having issues lately. The last time I saw her she and her husband said some hurtful things to me, so I wrote her an email about it two weeks ago but she still hasn't responded. What do?** 




 I don't know if I would classify either of my parents as hoarders, but they did have some organizational issues and compound that with a constantly under construction house and you basically end up with a hoarder-esque living situation. For several years, despite technically living in a three bedroom home, we only had one bedroom (where my brother and I slept) and the bathroom free, while all the stuff that would have been put in a den, kitchen, office, laundry, and crafting room were all kept in our living room where my parents slept. Yeah ... Not ideal. So I feel you, OP. 

Speaking as someone with a background in psychology, your mom most likely will not get better on her own. Hoarders aren't just messy or disorganized; their hoarding is the manifestation of a mental illness. They suffer from extreme anxiety that is triggered by getting rid of something. Sometimes it's because they're especially frugal and don't want to waste anything, or they're afraid that as soon as they throw it out they might need it later. Sometimes they keep things that remind them of loved ones or cherished memories they're afraid they'll forget about or dishonor if they dispose of the items that help them recall those things or people. We all have those feelings sometimes and hold on to things unnecessarily, but in hoarders this is taken to the extreme. And if they ever have to get rid of something, their anxiety can be overwhelming, which is why they often continue to hoard even if they know they have a problem and it's detrimental to their health or relationships. 

It's good that you're supportive of your mom and want to help her, and it's also good that she realizes her behavior isn't healthy. But these two things often aren't enough. Your mom needs professional help, and sooner rather than later. You should seek out a psychologist that specializes in hoarders or anxiety disorders and have your mom see them ASAP, because this sort of problem only gets worse the longer you leave it be. Considering that hoarding can have very nasty consequences like unsafe living conditions, having adult protective services intervene, getting evicted, or having a house condemned, it is essential that she gets treatment before it gets to that point. 

Best of luck, OP. 




 Who knows, if he is attracted to you he might be releaved to find out you're a woman. But yeah, if he is actually gay, I hope he becomes more comfortable with himself and you can have a better friendship. 




 Wow. Nope, that is totally abusive. I'm really glad you got out of that situation. 




 True. I've gotten support from expected places too. Who knows, maybe he just feels insecure about himself and you coming out to him will make him feel comfortable enough that he will act better in the future. There's always hope 




 That's really hard. I know how nerve-wracking it can be to come out to people, and there is a lot of hate out there toward trans women. I'm glad your other friend is supportive. I just hope you stay safe and your carpenter friend doesn't hassle you too much. 




 Anyone who disrespects your mental health issues is not your friend. I'm sorry she made you have a panic attack. Hopefully you feel less stressed out now that you don't have to deal with her. 




 Damn. What kind of friend or partner sends you hate mail? I'm so sorry, that guy sounds awful.
