 There's lots.  I'd suggest anything small batch and expensive ($40 +). 




 Not just whiskey, but GOOD bourbon.  




 Stay out of the well and you'll do yourself a favor.  




 Stop drinking cheap booze.  I'm 36 and started drinking good bourbon two years ago, and never have hangovers.  




 It's clear that 90% of the people in this thread have never worked in a auto shop.  




 lol

Ok, so was the guy trolling or serious?  




 If they have a good pace of play that is enforced, I'd join!  




 After a quick YouTube search.

Go on YouTube and watch and practice. 




 Like I said, that's all arms. He needs to swing with his shoulders.  




 Horrible angle. Should be straight on or straight behind, on an angle doesn't do much good. 

But lucky for your friend, his first flaw is really easy to see...

He's swinging with only his arms.  There was no hip or even shoulder rotation. He needs to form a triangle between his arms and shoulders and maintain that through the swing.  The swing should be with shoulder and hips, the arms just go along for the ride.  




 Darn, I missed the story.  




 No, I'm just saying that if oversteer is only thing, then the RS is the answer.  The ST is already faster and has more room.  




 Then why do I meet so many out on the golf course?  




 If everyone had your attitude, the range would not be able to keep up with the damage and repair cycle, and the would have to shut down the grass tees to allow them time to repair. 

Just hit in one straight line, not that hard.  




 The more I thought about it, the less I believe.  




 Your point?  You think the guys racing are racing stock? You can't talk about one car beating another on a autocross race track, then cry about budget. lol 




 So, I'll see you in autocross with the RS, in the rearview. 




 I almost down voted this comment.  




 The one I read and always remember...

Hogan was known for getting his 7 iron to stop on a dime.  Some guy asked him how he did that, to which Hogan replied with a question of his own. "Well, how far do you hit your 7?"  The man replied that he hit it about 130 yards, then Hogan said "Why in God's name would you want it to stop!?" 




 True, and the RS is the answer.  Which I'll be getting in 2017, and modifying my ST. 




 I have no hope for a girlfriend. 

I'm married.  




 Current 2014 Ford Focus ST.
Soon 2017 (I'm going to wait a year) Ford Focus RS.
I'll be keeping the ST and upgrading it.  




 Brazil?  




 A turbo set up would of added a grand to the sticker price.  Hell, my ST was the same price as the base model.  If they wanted to make that car fast, they could of.  Instead they made it look fast and spent their money on marketing.

But hey, if you like having a small fasy looking car that isn't fast at all, then good for you!   Just don't cry when I blow your doors off.   And God help you when I start to put upgrades into it.  




 Proudly. What does your car have that mine doesn't?  Yeah... 




 Ok, still doesn't mean that the FRS/BRZ is under powered.  It COULD of been a great car, but then they put a small engine in it.  Why make something small, light, and RWD if you're not going to make it fast?  It's like putting tits on a bull.  




 Just because CEO's and investment bankers are working less hours, doesn't mean the rest of us are. 

What an asshat.

I'm usually republican, but this current batch of idiots is worse than normal.  Paul is ok, but I'm actually for Bernie. 




 500 lbs heavier, but still is faster and handles better.  




 You drive a FR-S...  please don't be hating on the tank that is the crown vic.  Parts are easy to find and inexpensive, plus it's really easy to turn it into a go fast sleeper.  




 My FoST says that 200 IS under powered.  And the up coming RS just laughs. 




 Then I believe you.  I'm jealous, but I believe you.  You're probably a natural athlete and it sounds like you're putting in lots of practice time. 

Keep up the good work.  Don't neglect your short game and putting.  




 Did you play baseball or another sport before picking up golf? Did you take lessons? 




 Yeah, I can see doing this on the 8th hole, but 18th?  




 Yeah, that's completely wrong.  




 Sorry, I've heard those are good little cars.  




 Reminds me of something Stephen King wrote in the beginning or end of one of the Dark Tower books...

Some old lady wrote him, telling him how she was dying of cancer and wanted to know how the books would end, and she swore she wouldn't tell anyone.  It broke his heart to know he couldn't tell her, because at the time, he had no idea how it would end.   George R.R. says he has an idea on how it will end, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's just saying that to keep us from completely losing our collective shit, or if it doesn't change on him in the process of writing it. 

And the best part is, we'll get to see/know, if he finishes, because he's told D D how he thinks it will end.  So we get to compare, one day, maybe, hopefully... 




 Actually, that probably plays a bigger roll.  I don't build race cars, so I'm not 100% sure on any of my answers.  Just from my background, reading, and educated guess.   I'm thinking it's a combination of heat, turbo lag, and old school racing mentality.   




 Turbo lag.  When they are running less than 10 second 1/4 mile, turbo lag is a serious draw back.   If you have a "normal" car, the top end power of a turbo is a fair trade off for the half second of lag. 




 Good for you! 




 Without knowing how to drive stick? So, how much do you love it?  




 I wasn't sure if those came with auto options or not.  




 Thankfully Ford has our back, by making models that ONLY come in manual.  Focus ST and RS. 




 You truly are sad.  




 My feelings are fine. I just find it funny that you call me an asshole, then try to resort to unfounded personal attacks. So, feel free to try again, little man.  




 It is if they don't repot the tow. 




 I agree, that irons are important, so are wedges and putting, but I feel the driver is the most important.  If you can't put the ball safely in play, you're not going to score well.  I'm hitting my highest fairway percentage ever, and it's lowered my score a ton. 

But, I think the key to everyone's game is: Spend time on the range!  LOTS OF TIME.
 




 You can go back to your sad life now.  




 Did you happen to "find" those in someone's car? lol 




 No, I read it on an online magazine, before the Hellcat came out.  




 Some of the biggest track monsters that are our there are twin turbo charged mustangs.  All tuner guys know that the free HP you get from turbos is better than a supercharger.   Manufacturers use Superchargers because they require less piping, easier tuning/programing, and most "regular" people prefer the instant power of the Supercharger, and the dual scrolling turbos are still relatively new.  




 Plus, you call me an asshole, yet you're the one trying to make personal attacks.  Sounds like you need to take a good look in the mirror.  




 The head engineer of the Hellcat said they used the supercharger because he liked he sound.  




 No, a wife of six years who lives with me.  And I'm an asshole because that's how I was raised.  I don't need to change, you just need to accept that.  Please don't try to reflect your shitty life onto me.
