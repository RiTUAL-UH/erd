 I went grocery shopping with my ex a few weeks ago and someone she knew greeted her and asked if I was her boyfriend. I quickly replied that we're just friends so she wouldn't feel bad about breaking up with me. Still feels bad man. Deep inside. 




 Awesome! Thanks for the reply. I haven't seen or heard pretty much any of the words from Rocket so I'm out of the loop. I appreciate it! 




 Am I the only one who was shocked to find that Aaron's belt has his name on it?

Great sketch regardless! Keep it up! 




 As a human that has lived with sight for at least 20 years of my life, I can confirm that the moon does in fact illuminate the world by reflecting the light of the sun. According to DayZ, the moon is a large white dot in the sky that hardly does anything else. I would understand the extreme darkness of the night during a new moon, but there would seriously be MUCH more light, even in the woods, when the moon is out.

Source: I've been outside where there are no other sources of lights (buildings, lamps, etc.) and I could see things.

Okay I know I'm joking a lot, but really. Any word on a *little* bit more light for us night walkers? 




 Haha right! Thanks! 









 That's the same thing they told Copernicus.  




 I'm sorry, I feel like I should add to the conversation now that I'm at a computer. Connor, if it's not too late, here are my suggestions, and the way my team does it:

 - First of all, if you're going to use DayZ Database, be warned, it's not 100% correct. We use it, but we're careful. Here's what you do. Go to the wiki entry ([UAZ dayz wiki](http://www.dayzwiki.com/wiki/UAZ)) of a particular vehicle, let's say the UAZ. Scroll down and look to the right under the picture where it says rarity. This tells you how many to expect. If it doesn't give you an exact number, just make an assumption. If it says rare and their are 8 spawns on the map, assume 2 or 3 exist.

 - Second, use your dayzdb map to search for the UAZ only. Hit each of the spawn points. This is slow, and not perfect, but it's a good way to check if vehicles are on the server. If you play a low pop server then they will most likely be there. There is a chance they will already be gone, but that's just something you'll have to deal with.

Another way to do it is to uncheck everything except vehicles on the dayzdb map and follow the south coast starting at kamenka, and check every spawn along the coast of Chernarus. A friend and I did that and we didn't find one until we hit Solnichniy. Finding vehicles is a slow process, just keep at it. If you think you are just absolutely not finding vehicles that should be there, it's the server. Find a new one.


Pretty reliable locations for me: Vyshnoye for the GAZ and the south, slightly west bicycle spawns. GAZ has always been there for me, and the bikes are usually there.  




 Comments like yours will be deleted because they don't answer the question or add to the topic. As I'm sure mine will too. This is what happened here. 




 Regardless, it happens every day, constantly. Many, perfectly fine questions are not allowed here because of the insanity of the rules. Just about anything can be asked of science to explain, no matter how ignorant the one asking may be.

And in regards to layman speculation, if someone posts, "I think," or "I'm speculating here," it should be perfectly fine! I mean, where do we get new science? People speculating! People ask questions without proof! This is the core of science! Obviously a comment should be deleted if it says "The Earth is definitely flat. Believe me, I'm trustworthy," DELETE IT. But come on, AskScience is killing the foundations of science, people hypothesizing.  




 I was on my phone, and it showed you replying to a reply to OP's comment. I  didn't think you were talking to OP here. This is my mistake, I apologize! 




 What the fuck? What is he supposed to ask? Everyone was removed because he didn't have proof that cats are compelled to return home? His proof is in his own fucking cat, jesus. He is asking for the scientific reason. He is asking the scientists of Reddit why *his* cats are compelled to return home, is that not enough proof? I don't understand these two subreddits anymore, AskScience and AskReddit. It's like, they're called ASK reddit, ASK science. Your rules make it nearly impossible to post anything on these subreddits anymore. I apologize for my lack of civility here, but this is outrageous. This is one of my favorite subreddits and, when there is a question I want answered, IT ISN'T ALLOWED TO BE ANSWERED. Oh well! 




 ~~He did, his post was connected to a comment op made~~

EDIT: Phone Reddit confusion, my mistake dumble! 




 It's also a perfectly fine way to respond to everyone if you don't want to individually reply 




 Is their a subreddit where these kind of posts belong? Not trying to start a fight, I'm genuinely interested. I enjoy these posts when I take the time to read them. If their is a sub I can subscribe to where they belong, that'd be great! 




 Hey, you give me hope. I'm dealing with some people who are close to me who are depressed, and seeing you have so much hope and prospects for the future cheers me up considerably. I hope everything goes great for you man! You deserve it! 









 This is amazing. If the water was not transparent enough to see the plug, I had to have someone else pull it out, because there was always *something* in the water... 




 I've had to adapt to having my door open so my cat can leave my room to use his litter box in the middle of the night.

I haven't slept since I got him. 




 I experience that crippling fear every day at school. I'm a pretty good student, and usually do fine in my classes, but this semester my grades have tanked, all because I don't understand the material at all. I'm afraid because I'm going to lose my scholarships, not be able to afford college, and then my student loan debt will start asking to be paid. My fear drives me to do better so that I'm not put in an impossible situation. Take hold of it and use it to take charge of your life. I know when you're physiologically predetermined to have a hard life, it can be almost impossible to fight through it, but I bet you can make it through the fear if you fight back. I hope I don't sound like a cheesy PSA right now... Message me if you want to talk about anything! 




 I was cracking up at your list! Especially the "strangers are people too," and the "eventually seduction" bits. Maybe I'm easily amused, but you're a funny guy. Become a world famous comedian! Easier done than said.

My friend lost 170 pounds once. He told me the thing that helped the most was watching his diet closely, but he also took thermogenics. To my knowledge they increase your internal temperature helping you burn fat faster, or something like that, and they're safe. You could definitely try those if you're looking to lose wait. Gets a lot more out of a simple treadmill work out!

There are plenty of jobs that will hire you without a high school education. They may not be glamorous, but you have options at least. I may be wrong because I live in America, but I bet Australia is a pretty good place too. You could try to work for a [video gaming company out in Australia since you have a passion for video games.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Video_game_companies_of_Australia) That link is a list of companies in Australia you could look into it. You'd probably need some coding education from a university before that pans out, but at least it's a goal!

I'm not an expert on having my life together, but I hope my words are helpful. Good luck cactuspowder! 




 You're correct.. sadly... 




 That's another thing I was thinking. As long as they don't look stupid it would be a pretty good option! 




 Plywood is already coated in Polyurethane. The liquid resin sounds like a good plan, yet I'm worried about mixing it to purity. Follow instructions though, right? haha 




 I checked out your table. It looks very smooth! The problem is the cost. I put two coats of polyurethane on this table and that took a full bottle. I don't own any tools so I would have to rent the orbital sander. Thinking ahead this may prove cheaper than my other options though, so I'll keep it in mind! 




 How much does MDF cost? And what method would I use to attach it to the desk? Nails? I haven't worked with it before. I'll look into that as a possibility, thanks! 




 Don't think "I haven't got any strengths or skills," think more, "I have the drive to learn new strengths and skills." And everyone has skills, you just need to figure out what they are. Focus on thinking of a skill that relates directly to what you're applying for. Without knowing more about you it's hard to say much else! 




 The table top is made of plywood. [This is basically what it looks like with dimensions.](http://i.imgur.com/A2MRi.jpg) The plywood is sanded enough to be smooth, but I need something smooth enough that I can write on a piece of paper on it. Any good ideas? I was thinking something like tiles, but the tiles would have to be big so the grout isn't in the way. Lighter would be nice, but not necessary. Any ideas would be great! I can take pictures of the actual desk if need be.
