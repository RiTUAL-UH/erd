 Aaaaaaand now it exists!
 




 Haha, I'll give you that! 




 Apparently there is a spurs shirt buried under the centre circle. 









 HAhahahahahah 




 That voice! 




 What's to say Burial isn't transgender? 









 There's something very satisfying watching them struggle from the grip of the shredder.  









 You can set up sab to listen for .nzb's in a certain folder eg downloads, then as soon as you have downloaded the .nzb will then automatically be loaded to you queue. 









 I also thought this. Why is the bottom of the card instructing how long to wait before collecting been ripped off? But then again, this is the internet where nothing is a lie. 




 Oh right soz, I thought you had changed the font in the second image. 




 Hey man, looks great. Could you send a .PNG of the second design?

 Heeeey Sol Campbell, JU-DAS! I wanna knoooooow why you're such a c*nt!
  




 Can confirm that we were singing this ALOT tonight.  




 Chill guys, i was joking! 




 Any other player I'd say that was accidental. But Messi...  




 I should have added that it needs to be able to pick up the 5ghz band.

**Edit:** i'm not necessarily looking for something cheap. 




 I've always prefered to connect my desktop to my router via ethernet, however currently this isnt possible. What is the best most reliable receiver on the market at the moment. It will be communicating with a Netgear Vmdg480. 




 Does this ama in anyway make up from the loss of your imaginary internet points?  














 Mein Kampf quite believe it!  




 Ever since the closure of NZBmatrix I am yet to find a new home due to the closed door approach most of the index sites are using now. If someone could help me get in to one of these it would be most appreciated.  




 **Just piggybacking this top comment so this gets seen**  

Here are some witness accounts of what actually happened .

 It happened near to me. Spurs youth lit it and threw sideways into row s. The 47 year old guy arrested was in a suit and wore glasses. The smoke bomb fell at his feet. It was horrible, my 13 year old was gagging as was everybody in the vicinity and it stung the eyes. The guy in the suit picked it up and threw it out of the way much to the relief of all those around him. After that further down someone else would have done the same to get it clear of them. They would not have been able to see where they had thrown it. IMHO neither of them should be charged or banned. They had to clear it from where they were. It was very sad that it hit the linesman but it wasn't a hooligan issue it was a safety issue. We were searched going into the ground so I have no idea how those who took it in managed to get the smoke bomb in. 

another:

 The fella who threw it on the pitch (and unfortunately hit the linesman) is a mate of mine. It originated from the Spurs fans in the upper tier and landed in the lower tier. My mate tried to lob it underarm on to the side of the pitch because the people around him were struggling to see / breathe. Unfortunately he mis-judged it a bit and hit the lino, just an unfortunate accident. Plod and the Villa stewards had a word with him and to be fair the stewards were really good, they realised what he was trying to do and told the old bill not to nick him. He was back in for the 2nd half so presumably the two they have nicked are the ones from the upper tier who threw it in the first place

 Exactly! How are we supposed to concentrate on the job at hand without the internet!

 Just saw a Facebook group: "Hi, I'm a bra. I touch your girlfriend's boobs every day... Jealous yet? ;D"

Joke's on them, my girlfriend doesn't need a bra yet. 




 Looks like the perfect place to live during a Zombie Apocalypse

 Rivaldo used to be my favourite player, i had the up most respect for the guy! Pretty mush idolised him and formed my own game around his style! Then [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo4oUnpcmws)is happened and my opinion of him changed dramatically! 




 Sooooo....Madonna, enough with the crotch already!
