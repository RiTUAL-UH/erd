 Yeah we turned it on and the light and fan came on but we didn't think to check if it heated up. Hopefully we can sort something out. Cheers  




 Nah the house is established. House is maybe 25 years old but the ovan wouldnt be more than 7 years old. 

Well when we turned the ovan on at our final inspection the light and fan came on so we figured it was fine. 

same thing happened tonight, lights and fan came on but very little heat. 

Anyway thanks for the reply ill check through the contract and maybe see a solicitor.  




 Ok, so around three weeks ago my partner and i moved into our first home that we have brought. 

Tonight i used the ovan for the first time  and to my suprise it doesnt work. Turns on but does not heat hup. Took 3 hours to heat up frozen pasties. not cook, just warm them slightly. 

Anyway, does this land back on the original vendor or realestate agent? Or am i boned? 

Cheers in advance.

Edit: Thanks heaps guys. Ill try my luck with the agent tomorrow otherwise ill cop it. Hopefully its not something major! It's been so long without a roast dinner :(  




 Sounds good! I noticed a few flavours did not do too well in beta, will the juices available at launch be the revised recipes?  

Good luck with the launch!  




 Drink up! And thanks :)  




 That sounds like such a horrible way to go. I'm sorry  




 Nah he croaked. He was well into his 80's. 

I remember my dad coming into my room laughing before he told me. Seemed fitting for the old bloke, he was a bit of a joker in his day so i'm sure he would have wanted us to see the funny side of it.  




 My great grandfather died while he was taking a shit on the side of a road. I imagine this must be how he must have looked. I never really thought about it.  




 I'm in the middle of watching 248. When its on ill keep an eye out for it... 




 My 7 week old son is kickin arse and my partner and i have brought our first home! 

Life is good!  




 "I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our houses!"
