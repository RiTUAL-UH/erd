 What's up? 




 Double comment! :O 




 Double comment! :O 




 My mouse sometimes scrolls further than I want it to, does that mean I should be punished for not spending extra money on a good mouse? 




 Do you have them set by class? Do you put all your super cool Aussies and unusuals on page one? Maybe you have all of your stranges on one page and hats on another?  
  
I'm about to try to organize my [badly sorted] (http://backpack.tf/profiles/76561198049118645) backpack and want to look at some backpacks to get an idea of some ways I could set up mine.  
  
Thanks in advance I guess :] 




 I think I've used 2,147,483,647 on this sub at least 10 times. 




 Nah just make the hitboxes bigger and then people won't be staring at them for 5 seconds. 




 *Please note: I am only including deaths that are specific, so no "Killed by Scout" or anything of that nature.*  
  
**Times backstabbed**: 14  
**Times headshotted**:17  
**Times airshotted**:2  
**Times Reserve Shootered**:1  
**Times Flarepunched**:4  
**Times killed by environmental hazards (Sawblades, Train, etc)**:2  
**Times airblasted into hazards**:2  
**Times killed trying to pick up somebody else's gun**:2,147,483,647  
  
So yeah if Valve could increase the size of the guns when trying to pick them up that would be sweet. 




 The good outweighs the bad though.  
Let's imagine a new weapon that can do 300 damage as it's only upside, but it has much less ammo, much less speed, and some other downside.  
The upside on that is a hugely overpowered damage buff with some downsides that don't even matter.  
  
Now we can apply this to the loch.  
Upsides of faster speed, more distance, and more damage to Engineer crap.  
The downside of less ammo in the clip doesn't matter because the extra distance means you can sit back and fire from a distance and reload.  
The extra speed makes it much easier to hit *direct* shots on one person making the lower radius not matter at all.  
The lack of rollers doesn't matter much anyway, those are mostly for taking out nests which you can do easier with the extra damage to buildings.  
  
Loch isn't overpowered anymore but that doesn't mean it's bad. 




 Sounds like you got Puff n Stung, son. 




 The cases weren't dropping so to fix this another contract was given out to let people who already did the contracts for this week could get a case.  
  
Sorry if this has already been said but I don't want to read through 198 comments to check. 




 Wow that's the first time I've ever had somebody say that to me, you're such a funny guy! 




 Yesterday, you said tomorrow, SO JUST DO IT! 














 Maybe it belongs in a Muslim's butthole or something?  




 Here's how to solve this problem.  
All rockets are trying to kill you. 




 What a nice way for you to try and get your comment karma back. Your attempts aren't futile at all. 




 ITT: People have them and won't tell me how I can get one.  




 "How many buddies would I need to kill to get enough cash to buy one?"?  
  
2,147,483,647 people who all have at least $23 dollars on them. 




 How did you check these out? I tried to go into itemtest and I didn't get an option to add unusual effects on the guns. 




 Found like a timed drop or what? Can you give me a link to your backpack.tf so I can check it out? 









 [That is a community reference, right?] (http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120618043638/fantendo/images/1/1a/Troy_and_abed_handshake.gif) 




 counter b0ss: global ramen 




 Twice a week I think. 




 Only Medics that didn't get an bersaw yet used that thing before, Valve's just letting Medics get better. 




 Use a skill based weapon? 




 If you throw a killstreak kit or some other modification like a name/desc tag then the stock becomes tradeable. 




 Lookadaflickadawris! 




 It's worse than the can of Pepsi that's been sitting on my desk for a week. I used to want to drink it but now it's something I want to throw out. 




 I don't mind paying for the challenges or anything, but from what I read they're weekly for three months. I'm not math master but that's probably like 10ish drops. 




 The item skins are pretty. Paying to do the challenges is lame.  
  
VALVE YOU RUINED THE POCKET PISTOL I HATE YOU WHY WOULD YOU RUIN MY FAVOURITE THING!?  
  
Boxtrot taunt is radical. 




 Didn't see that last one until you pointed it out, thank you. 




 "Better sarcastic than stupid" would be another way to put it I guess. 




 Buddy you did a double post, you should probably delete the one I didn't reply to so people can see your original post. 




 Yeah yeah whatever who cares, I don't see any hats in here... 




 Here's how I deal with hackers.  
  
Complement the hacker like "Yo dude those Amby shots are on point, do you play CS:GO or something?" or "Duuuude you are amazing" because then they're like "Oh thanks man really means alot to me." and then I say to the team chat "Lmao that dude is hacking."  
  
Then I say "Hey I got a pizza on the way so I'm gonna leave now, peace out." and leave the hacker to do his thing.  
  
You really can't do anything about them but leave and they mostly want to get reactions of rage, so being cool, calm and collected about it and leaving for a different reason than "AY FUCK THIS GAME I HATE YOU LMAOBOXING FUCKS" doesn't give them the satisfaction of a reaction.  
  
Or since LMAOBox is VAC undetected I use my own VAC...cinator. Throw that bad boy onto my homeboy Pringle and let him go to town with some 1337 AWP skills. 




 The first one is probably Baby Face's Blaster, the second one is probably me torrenting anime while I play because nobody can hit you when you do that, permacrit doesn't work on any hacks that I'm aware on, those Snipers are just shooting you when your head pokes out.  
  
This isn't CSGO you can't shoot through walls. 




 Why do so many people use the Pain Train? It's garbage on Soldier.  














 Oh yeah that's the problem, it's to combat phishing bots.  
If you're like 13 or something just ask your parents if you can put $5 on your Steam account, if you're old enough to have your own credit card then throw down some cash and you can start looking cool as hell with your new hats. 




 *cuntface* 




 Peachie is nerd doesn't even let us listen to Kill la Kill x Sonic the Hedgehog remixes. 




 If your account is like less than a week old or something adding everyone will give you this error IIRC. But I doubt that's the problem. 




 [Yes] (http://i.imgur.com/IHO4iBd.png) [they] (http://i.imgur.com/W1AC5Bp.png) [are] (http://i.imgur.com/qpUXB5x.png) [also] (http://i.imgur.com/FDx8fHR.png) [click] (http://i.imgur.com/HLiJKKW.png) [every] (http://i.imgur.com/83HHVHw.png) [word.] (http://i.imgur.com/G8vT5nu.png) 




 Specail needs, maybe. 




 Post to rule34, there's nobody there going "Nah, I only like girls with curves." or something stupid like that, I have 1,690 from /r/randnsfw and posting whatever I needed to post. 




 I have the BFB, BONK Atomic Punch and the ability to play Scout. Now I only need friends and I can do this myself! 




 cool 




 I went to the market yesterday and picked this pile of shit up. [blah] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440_2_3884772027) 




 If you want karma go to a porn subreddit. 




 I'd say you should give it away here or /r/randomactsoftf2, I wouldn't recommend scrap.tf because I've heard that there are bots that auto enter all the raffles and then give all the winnings to their mains.  
  
You could also do contests for some of the items, maybe the person who can get a strange to the highest level first or something gets to choose an item.  
  
Also you probably shouldn't give that Max's head away for free unless you're feeling very nice, that's like an $80 item. 




 [Got it] (http://i.imgur.com/dygxJxj.png) 









 If this counts then Biggie Smalls - [Hypnotize] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk4ftn4PArg) has a version that I [hate] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glEiPXAYE-U src_vid=wk4ftn4PArg annotation_id=pfc%3AglEiPXAYE-U feature=iv) so much. 




 omg never knew 




 I don't know why these two weapons get such a bad wrap together, +2 hp per second is laughable when you consider that he's losing a Shotgun, +15 hp on hit is a fair balance for losing a shot. How is basically +17 per hit broken?  
  
It's maybe +21 hp back between the time it takes for you to hit him again, it's really not that big a deal. 




 Big Black Cock Soldier? 




 Google tf2mate.  
  
It will help greatly for this and help even more if you want your crosshair to change on different weapons.  
Also if you use a laptop or low end pc then you can lower your graphics to trash tier for higher fps. 




 I was wondering why this had 0 points, but then I saw that wall of beautiful items.  
  
You're banned from my kitchen you aussie-hatin' twat. 




 i-it's not like I came here to s-shitpost or anything.  
*Anta baka!* 




 There aren't really many mods that can make your game look better, I guess you could use tf2mate and choose the movie settings for the best visuals.  
  
Mods are mostly disabled in Valve servers though. 




 It's much easier to hit with this thing but people don't use it because splash is too good. I just like to play my game like I'm always in a frag video so I need to hit airshots all the time. 




 The masturbating or filthy franking? 




 Filthy Frank is like masturbating, you can do it alone and feel great, but I don't want to watch you do it. 




 If it were in the Soldier's voice there's a high chance it would be trash tier, there's a parody of that Mulan song somewhere and it is basically my name. 




 Dude this shit is fire, that's goin' right into the folder! 




 You have the 33rd highest post in this sub ever. [What the hell!?] (http://i.imgur.com/LGlflC4.png) 




 Yeah that nerd, he's got like the 40th highest post in the sub. 




 At least my name can be *relevamt* at times, unlike you Mr. FGHIK. 




 One dude got Reddit Gold and like 5,000 upvotes for  
  
I love seeing spies disguised as me.  
My taste in hats is so fucking rad 




 I tend to use these parts as a default if I want random things.  
  
Players Hit  
Kills While Ubercharged (Replaced with Headshots if it's a Sniper)  
Gib Kills on guns that gib, Critical Kills on weapons that I feel will crit often like a melee or something, or if it's something else I'll go for Damage Dealt.  
  
I don't know if Loose Cannon can gib or not so whatever I guess.  
I'm pretty sure Double Donks counts as 1/3 strange parts so if it does go for Players Hit and Damage Dealt. 




 This is even worse than a Lime Scout, honestly I've had some some good times with Lime Scouts but this guy looks like a total wannabe that's also a buzzkill. 




 I've watched LMAOBox streams and been to the fourms a few times, apparently every copy of LMAOBox is different and that's why it's harder to find. Even if Gabe Newell himself decided to buy 30 copies of LMAOBox to shove into the VACBox they'd just be banning the versions they got.  
  
Imagine going to the beach and knowing that every grain of sand is unique (They aren't really but pretendsies) and that it's your duty to make sure that all the sand vanishes for your master plan of crashing a plane.  
  
You create a machine that can take something, scan a large area for copies of that thing and it will *poof* remove all of them.  
So you use it on a grain of sand and direct it at the beach. But nothing happens because they're all different apart from maybe 7 grains that are very similar.  
  
Obama is an attractive man. 




 It doesn't but they are cool to make people more likely to stay for that one extra weapon. 









 New Meta, stand next to Gunboat jump and shoot man. He is now using a useless secondary. 




 The cream rises to the top! 




 I heard that unusual mtm taunts can lag servers due to how many particles they make. I've only seen it with Holy Grail but I have been told all of them do it, does yours lag servers sometimes? 




 Only male or female? Oppressive shitlord I identify as a Pyromaniac. 









 "Soccersteve22" and someone with some generic name but like "Genericname SMemes 1ref"  




 They are overpowered though! The moment a plat level Scout/Sniper/Pyro picks it up they are using a broken weapon that the UGC Iron teams can't do anything about! ^^slash ^^s 




 If you are good at the game you can counter the thing that is easy to do for other players. Gunslinger is a simple "Press 4, then 1, then mouse 1. Get kills." type of thing. If you need to be good to beat something a bad player can do it's unbalanced.  
  
[Here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EitZRLt2G3w) is a video which talks about balancing for skill, something Valve can't do very well.  
  
Valve seriously hand the game over to this subreddit we'll take care of it like it's a newborn child. 




 *If it dings; it rings.* 




 ITT: Scottish people put too much salt into their booze. 




 Well you are right, it is very hard to use splash damage with the Loch in the same way the stock Rocket Launcher does. 









 What the hell is that meant to mean? 




 I think he meant to link this one because the dude's name is Tim. Maybe he's trying to sell me an Aces High Texas Slim's Dome Shine? 




 I just realised something, Rock was scammed which means his TC became dirty, right? So how many clean ones remain at this point, like 2? 




 Listen, I don't know what you think an airshot is but it isn't this. 




 [Childish Gambino - Sober] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx96Twg-Aew)  
[pinkomega - dumplings] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mWh2NdVmDE)  
[Sonic Adventure 2 Greatest Hits Revisited] (https://sonicisreal.bandcamp.com/releases)  
  
So pretty much whatever has a beat I can headshot to.  
I'm not even kidding I tend to only shoot on like a drum hit or something of that nature, it's like all of my gameplay is a Sniper frag video. 




 You... I like you. 




 I'm liking how this looks, strangely enjoyable. 




 What. 




 What did you do? 




 Why would you ruin a perfectly good math bo- I'm just fucking around math is worse than the FF fanbase. 




 This is basically a LMAOBox Heavy. 




 I do this too sometimes, just so that if a comment gets deleted I can show other people. 




 I only go good Sniper when somebody else is doing something annoying these days. I used to be that pubstomping AWP holding Australian Longshoot Man but now I just play him to counter Mini spam, RS Pyros and other Snipers.  
  
I also have binds for these three.  
And that's for piloting that stupid robot!  
Even a gibusvision wm1 would work better than you!  
Play a *real* class, Snipey!  
  
Boy does that last one boil some potatoes. 




 I'ma let you finish, but Beyonc just put on the Danger Shield.  
Any other Sniper wearing this fashionable piece of trash basically forces you to wear one yourself. 




 It wasn't me, I don't say ''EZ'', I say "And that's for piloting that stupid robot!" 




 Become satisfactory, obtain ChuckleContainer.  
Reach success, acquire BobSquare  
Improve drastically, take possession of LolTesseract  
KekCrate  
RoflSomething 




 Your point being?

 What 




 I sent Medli20 to [www.staemcornmunity.co.nz/click-forglassof-coke] (http://www.theodmgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/McDonalds-GWP-Olympics-Coke-Glass-629x463.png) and stole her Reddit account. 




 Why don't you check your inbox? You have like 41 messages with this being 42. 




 Indeed is joke
