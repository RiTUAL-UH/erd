 of course they will adopt the boat turn back policy it's what voters want and the last time they changed the policy there was a rise in arrivals by boats with many deaths at sea.

abbot was able to capitalise on that so changing it now wouldn't be a good idea.

i know many people on this sub would want to see a greens style approach to it but that's not what the greater majority of voters want and it could lose votes for whatever party tries to do it. 




 dr google wins again 




 great video awesome view

honest question though that i've been thinking about recently how long till drones are banned or heavily regulated? wanted to buy one but i have a feeling there will be new laws with them soon enough

 




 No one will give anything back to the aboriginals  




 NFl is so exciting with the 3 seconds play between 5 minutes of commercials and play reviews i fall asleep within 2 minutes of trying to watch that crap sport 




 no i like soccer and the world cups are 4 years apart not going to miss it because of a flag 




 that's still way to much

your healthcare system is a joke

 




 people need to stop crying so much about it so many people are becoming such precious little babies about everything

are they supposed to be goody two shoes so you all stop whinging? who even cares what they do off (or even on) the court

if they are making the sport money they will not get rid of them

 




 why is your healthcare so shit that someone without insuance would have to pay that much money? 




 that has to be fake how the fuck could your healthcare system be that shit

so glad i don't live in america

i broke my neck a few years ago and even needed a helicopter to the hospital a week stay with all the xrays cat scans physiotherapy etc.. cost me $0 and i didn't even have insurance
 




 game would suck if everyone was scared of you.. who would you kill besides monsters if everyone was like hail Geralt please don't hurt me

it's the same in Skyrim you fus ro dah someone off a mountain and his bandit buddies still try to attack you 




 Williams isn't winning anything as a customer team he's knows that and will take a offer from Ferrari

Mercedes won't dominate forever, Ferrari looks the best next option unless red bull gets there shit together and gets a car that doesn't explode almost every race. Mclaren won't be a challenger for at least 3-4 years and it seems they have a driver line up for the next few years

 




 i think haas will be better than manor 




 many people (Americans mostly) are prudes

blood guts and murder is fine but if they see just one tit they lose their minds 




 this is why the game needs a new game+ mode where you keep everything but the difficulty is much higher 




 yer that was a massive disappointment as well i had a sword i got from a chest or monster that did like 50 more damage or something i just ended up selling it 




 not the point it should of given something decent and unique not witch hunter armor given how witch hunters are evil and hated by players

i know you can now craft witcher armor but it would of been nice to get a decent reward armor instead of that crap especially if your not crafting witcher armor 




 they should of made the reward witcher gear 




 i thought that at first but after about 10 mintues i got the hang of it and it was a solid game from then on

i was close to uninstalling it because i thought the combat was stupid lucky i didn't 




 just wish it was better that archgriffin was a bastard to fight

don't know why they thought witch hunter armor would be a good reward 




 haven't got it on Xbox but it's one of the best games i've played in years

better than skyrim IMO 




 the stats and what not are great but i wasn't expecting it be witch hunter armor

witch hunters are cunts and i don't want to look like a cunt

don't know why they thought that would be a good reward 




 your military spends trillions and you want to complain about a small space mission costing under a billion that will make new discoveries

not to mention countless other shit in US and worldwide that has millions/billions wasted on it

stop your complaining it's a small amount of money 




 it's more than just photos it's a scientific mission that will learn new things

there is plenty of things on this world that could be considered a waste of millions of dollars but no one complains about it but when it's a space mission you all come out of the woodwork 




 roughly 2 billion on baldness treatment worldwide a year (probably more)

people just see space as useless so it's a waste of money in their eyes 




 why does everyone always say this?

throwing some food at the worlds hungry people solves nothing they still have no food when that runs out in day or two

 




 what good would that do? 

you feed them for a day or two but they still don't have access to food after that 




 always annoys me when people say things like it's a waste of money etc etc when it comes to things in space

billions goes into hair loss treatment but not for malaria and other life threatening things but you don't see people complain about that

 




 i'd say the same about the hipsters who wear skinny jeans 




 there is a lot of young people that don't vote greens don't think just because people are young they instantly vote greens

green voters typically are in inner city areas outside of that i don't think the support is as high


 




 if the streak is 5 years long and it like this with Mercedes on the podium every race F1 will lose a lot of people who are already saying the sport is predictable and boring
 




 a new much harder game mode that let you keep your end game stuff would be great for those that want a bigger challenge

 




 the reason is ISIS is a threat that's happening now which people can clearly see slaughtering people and encouraging terrorist attacks worldwide it's also manged to brainwash people worldwide to join them (including schoolkids)

Climate change is a threat but one that is slow and changes happen over decades

humans tend to react to immediate danger not one that takes years 




 Its not essential but it helps so you know the characters from the last two games and some of The back story about the wars and what not

Though if the 3rd game is the first one you played you might not like the first two (game play not the story)  movement is completely different like no jumping or climbing unless there is a press whatever to jump or climb,  plus combat is different as well 




 Never a good idea playing a game series backwards there is huge differences between the 3 games

Before I bought witcher 3 I made sure to play the other 2 first far better idea 




 the greens are too far on the other side of the spectrum that people won't vote for them because of it

howard and abbott both got a lot of votes over border control policies which shows the majority doesn't want relaxed polices like the greens would bring 




 those countries have been fucked for years the wars are nothing on what the Taliban and Saddam did the difference was people couldn't just leave as they can now 




 don't like it and i don't even bother playing it

i liked the dice game from the previous two games better it was quick and a nice way to make some extra coin 




 most people always carry ID on them it's not rare these days to not leave home without it as we carry them in wallets 




 this is what i mean it's a good mechanic but the game relies on it way too heavily that it's overused

most quests end up using it at some point some way more than others

 




 i was fine with it at first but it got annoying towards the end

every single time i heard Geralt say gotta take a look around i knew i would be spending the next few minutes following a red trail towards something 




 have more witnesses to beast attacks which can narrow the search field so you don't have to follow blood trails and scents every single time or something like that

i don't mind witcher sense i just feel they really overdid it  




 i think they really overdid the witcher sense in this game almost every quest has you following a blood trail or scent

i know it's part of a witcher to have these abilities but they really overdid it just like Assassins creed used to overdo the trailing/eavesdrop missions

it's a great game (probably the best i've played in years) but the witcher sense part of it got tiresome considering how much they use it 




 if you're just getting one gram in Sydney it's typically $20 but i don't buy one gram at a time because it's a waste of money
 




 if much easier now to get drugs but it's pretty easy to get booze as well if they have a older sibling or someone at their school is 18

i used to get booze of people i worked with at maccas when i was 16 as many of the people i worked with were 18+ 




 if you mean kids worried that parents will see a video of them drunk or something they typically have accounts the parents doesn't know about or they are on a different website as well that parents don't use like twitter or something 




 it's actually much cheaper to get drunk

chateau d'cardboard $12-$20,
cheap vodka (or bourbon etc)- $22-$30,
bottle of cheap wine - $10-$20,
6 pack beer $16

weed is $20 a gram $50 for 3 and typically around $80-$110 a quarter

a kid can get a cask of goon and a 6 pack of beer cheaper than they can get 2 grams of weed

 




 most people are going to be in support of this

we all have ID on us all the time anyway if you drive, most people keep ID in their wallet (even if they don't drive) and always have it on them so whats the big problem that a cyclist needs to have it 




 because people just don't like them and think they are a bunch of loonies

people will always vote labor/liberals reguardless of the shit they do because they don't want the greens in power

this is highly unlikely to ever change 




 it will never happen 




 that's a great way to get fucked with by the cops especially if it's a shitty area

why are you running etc etc.. you'll get searched and have your time wasted or probably shot if you're in America 




 ugly as hell 




 10 year old's know fuck all about the world and the current situation with the government

it's pretty clear the parents pushed him to do it 




 this!

voters don't want boat people which is one of the main reasons Howard and Abbott were able to win

no matter how loud the support refugee people are the vast majority don't want them and will vote for the party that tries to stop it
