 Some kid did that in my kindergarten class. Then the weird kid that no one liked went over and sucked the pee out of the carpet. The reaction on the teachers face was priceless now that I think about it. 




 The only thing that bothers me is that the tit she uses is no longer in line with the other from all the stretching. 




 His headline is from a Lady Gaga song 




 You are beautiful 




 I didn't know the Westboro Baptist Church did anything other than signs. 




 I went to hang out outside of school with that guy and when I brought it up, things got awkward. Never talked to each other again.

 I was drinking vodka primarily then got talked into a game where I drank wine and beer. I then went back to vodka. My morning did not go well.

Edit: I drank a shit ton of vodka. 




 Well I'm not at school for the time being. I live in a town of 10,000 where gay is still a major taboo. All of the gay guys my age have been smarter and moved away.

I hope it looks up for the both of us soon. Thank you for listening. 




 It's hard to get out of here. I was going to college last year, moved three hours away from home. I was really close to my boyfriend at the time with him only being less than an hour away at a different school.

I went to reapply for this past semester of school and had some issues with my loan and financial aid which forced me to stay this semester. I'm trying to become a forensic entomologist and my small junior college doesn't really handle people in that field which is why I'm trying to get into a major university (Shooting for A M). I found out last week that it's probably not going to happen because the advisors at my school got me into the wrong classes and I have to stay under a minimum 45 cumulative hours in order to get into the department at A M. They literally told me to forget my degree. So that has only brought me down even more.

My mother also broke her arm this past July so it was fortunate I stayed home. I got to take care of her because my father has a job five hours away so he's only home on the weekends. I'm stuck right now. 




 Hello everyone. I am 20 years old, overweight, and gay. Every time I meet someone and things go well, they end up rejecting me or saying they shouldn't be dating right now. I've only had one actual boyfriend. My friends all know that I'm gay, as well as my siblings. My parents are the people I'm working on. Please don't tell me they already know, that's not what I want to hear since I hear it so often from my friends and dates. For everyone else, it's not their business unless I want it to be. I don't care if someone else tells them, but I won't if I don't want to. To get to the point, I go on dates, talk to various guys, meet wonderful men, but can't get someone to take me as theirs. This is what makes me so down and low. Especially right now. I had been seeing this guy for 2 months, and things were so good. I couldn't believe I was able to find someone like him. Then things took a bad turn when I thought to bring up the conversation asking where this was going. Needless to say, I've been rejected. To make matters worse, my bisexual ex, who I have become very good friends with, has met a girl he really likes. He talked about moving to where she was, marrying her in the next few years. I would be fine if I wasn't so jealous that he's doing better than me. I've been to my lowest before, where I twice tried to kill myself. I'm scared about going back down. Every time I meet a great guy, it turns out to be nothing. I'm so tired of being tossed about. I'm so sad and alone, I don't know what to do. All I ever wanted was a companion to be with. I was alone growing up gay in a small rural Texas town, and as an adult, I'm lonelier than ever. I can't stop crying. I just want my pain to stop. 




 I too am from Fredericksburg. 




 My nana is very content at the nursing she's at. As she's said to me many times, "I got nothing to squawk at." She turned 91 recently and has been in the worst stages of Alzheimer's for the past couple of years. When we went to go see her for her birthday, she called my mother (her daughter) by name instantly. I could've cried. She hasn't known my mothers name in two years. Sometimes it all comes back to her, other days she's lost but happy. All she does is smile. I always bring her chocolates because they're her favorite. She doesn't know who I am but she knows she trusts me and when I look into her eyes it almost as if she's remembering me, but then the moment passes and she goes back to the chocolates. I don't think about her forgetting who we are. I think about if she's happy or not. I always ask, and the answer is always "Definitely." 




 I've all about given up even bothering to date anymore due to my fear of rejection. I personally haven't ever handled it well, and lately being as lonely as I am, I honestly am not sure what would happen if I got rejected, no matter how politely they said it. Yeah someday I could get a yes, but I'm too afraid. For you rejection might be easy. It's not for me. Not by a long shot. Being gay, I could just wait for someone to ask me, but I've had no offers. 




 Aw congratulations to the both of you! To many more wonderful years together! 




 :) nice 




 I just want to let you know, this gif made me laugh for so long, it started to hurt. It seriously made my fucking day. 




 My sister, her boyfriend, and I are all struggling with quitting. It's just so satisfying. I started smoking socially while I was drinking, and it evolved to a point where I used to smoke a pack a day. I'm 20!  I usually smoke now when I'm bored. I was so close to quitting last year. It would take a week to two weeks for me to finish a pack. Plus, being a broke college kid and not being able to afford them helped. I'm looking into some alternatives. If anyone had any suggestions, things that have worked for you, I'd be glad to hear some.  




 The hairy chest, the smile, and that butt. Mmmmm

 You weren't there either. Who are you to say otherwise? Regardless of the actual situation, whether the photo portrays abuse or humor, the statement made in the photo is sick. Don't talk about jumping to negative conclusions when you're jumping to one wirh me. 




 Practice what you preach and keep your opinions to yourself then. 




 Yeah because that totally makes what he's doing ok... 




 If he wants to draw a ballerina slipper that looks like a penis, let him.

 I would've said yes. 




 Yup 




 I could care less about downvotes. Just thought I'd share. 




 About two months ago I met up with this guy, hit it off, went back to his place to get it on. We started making out and we were having a good time. Then I noticed there wasn't much to grab a hold of while I was exploring. I figured it was just because of the way his dick might've been positioned. I went to go down and unzipped, pulled it out and just looked. This guy had a 2 1/2 to 3 inch dick. I am not joking at all. I wish I was because this guy was really cute. I'm a bottom and so there was no way I thought it would do the job. I didn't say anything, I just blew him, let him finish, pretended to look at my phone and was all "oh shit, I have to go! There's an emergency with a friend of mine!" Didn't see him again. 




 Horrified because you're jealous she's got a bigger dick 




 Looks like its already been done. Good job everybody. 




 Mother of god 




 There's plenty of chaser where I am. Problem is, they're almost all AT LEAST 20 years older than me. Finding someone around my age who isn't into a "daddy" type is hard.

 Having a hard time finding a video but these two are Jonah (the red-head) and Chris from Dirty Boy Video. I'd have to pay to see the video but there are some more photos.

 Same here! My first time was fantastic because the other guy was very experienced so he knew what he was doing. Anybody after that hasn't been that good and last time I had sex it hurt a lot. 




 Big boobs

 I live in Texas, which is home to two "Body Farms", belonging to Texas State University at San Marcos, and Sam Houston State University in Huntsville. I'm actually studying to become a forensic entomologist! I am so jealous (as bad as that sounds) that Stephen Fry got to visit one! In Texas, the "Body Farms" are very hard to get in to. They are very strict as to who is allowed in. I heard from a professor of mine that you even need express WRITTEN permission from the Dean, various department heads, etc. My professor has been trying to get into one of them for years with no success, even though she has her PhD in entomology. They had a problem a few years back with students taking cameras, phone, anything that takes photos, into the farm. The bodies are all donated and so the privacy and dignity of the decedent have to be protected, so when that was violated, they tightened the reigns. I'll hopefully be able to get in good words with a few people and maybe one day get in myself! Fingers crossed. If I can't get in, I can always wait until after I die. I plan on donating my body for research to one of these farms. Still, these farms are not just cool for a person like me, they help investigators and researchers out a lot.  




 Some girls are like that. They will do anything to avoid messing their nails up. 




 Awesome people 




 The males are harmless, yes. Females have the short pincers that can hurt. 




 If you want to know, this one in particular is a male. They have large pincers that obviously extend way past their heads. They are practically useless. The females on the other hand have short efficient ones that can hurt you, even draw blood. 




 I've never had a boyfriend who lived closer than 2 hours from me. 




 Think of it this way:

Either have parts of a dead rat spread about

Or

Have a live rat somewhere in/near/underneath your house 




 All I see is trash

 She's younger than Mother Dust 




 We're still beating this horse? 




 Transvestite, transgender. Transvestite is just so people can directly understand. The meaning of transgender can be pretty confusing for non-LBGT people. It was confusing for meand I'm gay. I use either interchangeably. 




 Looks like a transvesite. Clue is the hands and the face. Silicon injections and the hands are pretty darn manly. Someone's tucking a secret or is post-op. 




 Depends on what version/translation you read. In some it does say children and that they were killed. 




 Lana Del Rey is actually pretty pleasing make out music.

 Do you really have to pee in a girls mouth to make babies? 




 There are worms several feet long on other continents. 




 No 




 I'm so jealous. Fuck. 




 If you find a wound on the animal, there's a good chance that flies laid eggs in the wound. The main concern is that they can carry disease into the animal, making it sicker. In some cases the maggots actually help, eating the dead tissues (which is what they do) and clean up the wound. Doctors do it to humans, but they of course have access to sterile maggots. Still have the animal checked for infections and such.
Another theory is that it's bot fly larvae which burrow into the skin and incubate until they are ready to fall out and turn into adults. If you find small holes in the skin at central points (spaced/grouped fairly close together) could be bot flies. Have your animal checked just in case though. Hope this helped. 




 YESSSSS. Jill Harkness, reporting for duty. 




 Congrats! So jealous! I'd be focusing on Jinkx the whole time. I have a huge crush on her. I watched all the "Drag Becomes Him" videos and it made me love her even more. So happy you get to see them! 




 I never thought it a funny read because I loved Sharon, and at that point in the season, I could care less what the fuck PhiPhi thought about anything.
That video just pisses me off. She's so unprofessional. I never liked her, and I never will no matter how much convincing someone did. She's just ugly on the inside. 




 I LIVE!  




 If you can carry your groceries in a small basket like that, they can out them into a bag and you can carry it like that. There's really no need to take it outside to your car. 




 I've seen this in places far from the ghetto. It's just so the baskets don't leave the store. The store I worked for didn't allow the carried baskets to be taken outside. 




 I agree. It's pretty darn cute. 




 I couldn't either.
A week ago.
