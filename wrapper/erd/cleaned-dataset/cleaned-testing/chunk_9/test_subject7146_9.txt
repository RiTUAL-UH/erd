 You run across those guys every once in a while. Really, 5 tours just means you've been thru it a couple times, no real difference if you're trying to do good and interested in learning. Playing with triple digits is where the fun really starts, you can goof around and try stuff, and your ass is constantly covered.  
But I've only been kicked once, and it was because I was taking a bathroom break real quick, but it was a team of tryhards, so whatever. I have kicked a few, but never because of the number of tours.  
But I have found, that until you start to get an idea of the roles, playing the meta classes will help keep you from getting kicked. The meta is definitely over-rated, it's more about roles than classes, but folks generally are much more patient with meta classes.  

couple a quick engie tips: The robots will instantly destroy anything they touch except the sentry, so place teles and dispensers wisely.  Put exits in spots that are still useful if you're pushed back a bit.  
First thing you should upgrade on the first wave is dispenser range. Max it out right from the start. Personally, I also max out canteen instant upgrades as well right from the start, and keep them maxed.  Dispenser building and movement is the priority over your sentry, get it up first, your team mates will love you all the more (unless you need to quickly block.)  Rescue ranger is awesome, but make sure you try to keep over 130 metal so you can move stuff quick.  Never waste credits on the mini sentry, unless you have a ton o cash and kinda make it known that you have the extra cash so folks don't bitch, cause they will.  The jag only adds 15% speed, not 30%, so it's not a necessity.  2 way teles are only really needed on a few maps, so don't sacrifice the cash for them unless they're needed.  Try to block with the sentry, it's a huge asset in dealing with giant scouts, remember the robot needs to see a bit of room between it and the corner or object you're blocking with, otherwise it will go around, give it just enough room for you to walk through, they are bigger than you.  Upgrade wrench speed before firing speed, because when you bang on your sentry it adds ammo before it repairs, so if you're firing too fast you'll be doing far less repairing, and it's much harder to keep it up when it's getting bombed on. I never upgrade firing speed completely, only 1 or 2 in that upgrade.  As you get a bit of experience, and learn where people are attacking from, don't be afraid to move your dispenser around a bit. It's mostly ignored unless they don't have another target, but don't put it in the middle of everyone since it'll get splash damage. Make sure you put 1 point in metal capacity at the start as well, you can build both a sentry and a dispenser at the same time when you're full up.

edits: oh yeah, while it's the scout's (or whoever is being the money collector) main duty to get the cash, it's actually everyone's job. Grab the cash around you as you can, but make sure to get it if you're away from others. And remember, you can still get your credits back before the first wave starts. The minus signs are still there, so if you need to change things and have the time, you can. 




 The odds that you're being kicked only because you're a zero tour is really low. It's rare that I see a zero tour kicked just because. Almost every kick I see is from someone not listening, or don't have settings on to hear mics, or something along those lines. When I see a low tour with funky upgrades, I'll mention it. If they get defensive instead of asking about it, it's a pretty good indicator that someone will throw up a vote at some point. Sure, there are asshats who will kick just because, but they aren't nearly as prevalent as you seem to think.   

Want to not get kicked? Listen to high tours, or if no advice is forthcoming, ask. Read through forums, do a bit of research first. People trade for or pay a dollar for every mission, so it kind of pisses people off when someone won't do the legwork to be a contributor. Look through your friends' profiles and check out their badges. See who has some experience, ask for invites when you see them playing.  

Research, listen, ask, and you should very rarely get kicked. And don't take offence when a 4 tour wants to kick you. He knows about as much as you, and you'd probably have a better time on another team anyway.  




 I think you're completely wrong. Seems to me, if someone didn't have a phone or computer or tv these days, they'd be completely lost as to how to cure boredom. Before all that, we actually got off our asses and found things to do. So there was always something to do. 




 Other than magazines and newspapers? 




 Be kind and rewind. 




 Or newspapers? 




 The TV guide was hardly a pain. It was pretty damn easy to see what was on. Easier than to find out what's on then than it is now, methinks. 




 I think that every time I've seen 2 right turn lanes at a light, there has always been a sign saying "right on red only from right lane" or something to that effect. 




 The law everywhere in the US I've lived is that it's illegal to pass on the right. Same vein of thinking, but I've never read of a law that says you MUST drive on the right.  




 Slightly related, I'm somewhere on [this page.](http://www.27bslash6.com/guarantee.html) 




 I rarely watch anime, but I watched this one. Gotta agree with you. SAO1 was pretty good, and SAO2 just got kinda wonky. 




 ugh. I really don't like having to click to read every line of some story. 




 I just got my service disconnected. I had plenty of credit, but they were taking even more out of my account. I didn't see it coming, didn't go over my usage. I finally got tired of working for the savings with support and told the rep to just refund my credit and drop the service. Basically I paid $25 bucks for a crappy  phone, and I don't know how much in cheap, experimental  service with lag and variable quality.   

I tried something new, it didn't work out, but at least everything was fairly cheap all around and I didn't lose that much money.  

My advice to others who ask about it is to just skip it and go with Straight Talk or the like. In the end it's just not worth the hassle.  

End of Rant 




 It's uncapped, but gets throttled after a gb. Says it in the sign up ads for their "unlimited" plan.  




 "You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.
There is a small mailbox here."

These words are forever burned into my brain. 




 Not a text adventure, really. But yeah, those Sierra games were great. 




 I didn't think it was that bad. I got through it reasonably quick. Leather Goddess of Phobos and Star Trek: The Kobayashi Alternative games, however, stuck me good. 




  The worst thing about HHGTTG was that if you didn't feed a sandwich to the dog at the very beginning, you could play almost to the end before you found out that you couldn't win.

Microscopic space fleets. Getcha every time.

 Well, that and the one place where you had to "look" three times before you found something (don't remember what). Still, it kept me amused/frustrated for months.

On the Heart of Gold. You had to try 3 times to enter a room as the game tried to talk you out of it, then look 3 times as it tried to tell you nothing interesting is there. "Ok, the *are* a few interesting things in the room. You see ..." 




 Nice try, Snoven. 




 [FTFY](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c_5v3YFxnA t=1m18s) 




 Also, a lot of app devs are on xda, maybe dev has the apk in a thread there.
 




 2-4 months? Most of us don't have baby hair. 2-4 weeks maybe, if I don't shave every day. 




 I see a different wall with the same title every month or two. But, between the new and casual readers, it usually does well. That's reddit. 
 




 Sparks from Sealab 2021 truly doesn't give a fuck. 




 BOOGER!  




 So were you trying to be as clever as Douglas Adams with the title and just failed? You copied him with the only response you have on here, so I kinda assumed that's what you were shooting for. 




 ...I hate /r/askreddit anymore. I mean, WTF kind of question is this?  

Here's one for you: In 48 hours your arms are going to be amputated and you will be blind. What will you fill your fridge with while you still can?  

Sound fucking stupid? Yeah, that's what you're doing to us all. For the love of god, just stop. 




 How can one know a game is perfect if one has never played it? So perfect that it was pre-ordered 3 times? It's one of those posts that make me think "moron."  




 It is so flawless that you pre-ordered it? That's some GOP logic there.  




 The best way would be to move stuff onto your computer so you have space, make your nandroid, move the nandroid to your computer and put your stuff back on your phone. However, you should probably keep your most recent nandroid on your phone. It you don't have space for it, you're just overcrowding your phone. 




 "Restart the button!" "It was a glitch!" "It should count down from natural causes, not technical issues!"  

Yes, it died from a glitch instead of a natural lack of pressers. But that's life. We don't get do-overs. We don't get to chose to restart from scratch. Once something is dead, mourn it, but don't disrespect it by reviving it (and I'm betting they will find another excuse later on.) It is tainted now, it isn't what it was, it's life from here on out will be accompanied by a *footnote.  

It died. Sorry it didn't die some grand death, with thousands of people trying to remember their alt account's password to scramble to keep it going. Sometimes things just leave us unexpectedly and suddenly, without preamble or fanfare.  

Deal with it, or keep cheating the button of the awesomeness it deserved. I was grey when it died, and had planned on trying for red. But as far as I'm concerned, I let myself get stuck with gray, so gray I shall stay. It's only right. I'd rather not be asked "did you click before the crash or after?" anytime flairs come up in the future. 




 Yes, the button should be done. I personally want to see it keep going, but if it stops, for whatever reason, it stops. Restarting the button means that from this moment on, anything done with it will always have an asterisk after it. It stopped. People didn't want to see it stopped, so they restarted it. Now we know they will do this any time they wish, whenever they can find a decent argument for it. It's tainted now. Press if you wish, but as far as I'm concerned it's all a big cheat now.  




 I played with a heavy who had aimbot (it wasn't that I suspected it, it's that he was constantly turning until something was shootable, then he would blast them. It was the most obvious thing in the world, I have no idea why people do these things.) Anyway, I went ahead and stuck around to see what would happen for drops. I thought no one would get anything. Not only didn't tf2 not notice the aimbotting, but he got an aussie minigun. 




 A dirty, dirty cheater flair. 




 I'd like the source for that. 




 Snap. 




 When I click anywhere on a comic, it goes to the next page. Somewhat common feature. But GG also has a bookmark feature. While I was catching up on it, I could simply click "Save Bookmark" and click "Load Bookmark" anytime I wished to continue at a later time. Is there some reason this isn't everywhere? It actually was an incentive to keep reading when I had started from the beginning. Reading a webcomic from a previous point shouldn't be a chore. 




 Congrats, this is the only post today to make me laugh. :) 




 DEATH-RACE! 




 This is, it would seem, apparently true. 




 Source? 




 Pretty sure that same racer wasn't out to kill his opponent. 




 Really? Got a source for that? Cause the only thing I can find about why it's legal to hunt elephants is that by hunting them legally it lets hunters kill for ivory legally so they have more money to keep from poaching. In essence, it simply changes their title. 




 Well, there was a difference. He wasn't out killing, and it was a freak accident. He did risk his life and knew he was always taking some sort of risk, but at least he was always trying to help. Irwin was a good guy, you're going to get downvoted for not loving the good guy. The rediquette is a pipe dream. 




 Screw him. It's also legal for cops to kill unarmed folks, the rich to take from the poor, and for courts to take your property when you break no laws. There is a distinct difference between legal and right.

 This is how we all have learned the importance of backups, by losing something costly. Unless your carrier can help, I believe you're screwed. Maybe a tech can get them for you, though I doubt it.  




 Don't think so. I think you'll have to take a few minutes to look your devices up and make your own list.  




 Voodoo ota rootkeeper might work for you. Check around.  




 Yeah, spinning, curved bar, maybe turnig plane. 




 Am I the only one who doesn't see the difference between this and seeing a rod go straight through a round hole about the same diameter? I just look at it and think "Well, yeah, that's just where the rod breaks the plane." It doesn't seem odd or anything to me.  
I guess I can see how it could look neat, but it just looks obvious to me.  




 Be careful, bricked phones are a real thing, and the likelihood of it happening varies greatly from device to device. Do more than read forums where you find your phone. Create accounts and ask questions, pick brains, see what kind of issues others have come across. XDA is usually my first stop for Android questions.  




 I love digital, but the albums I had seemed like they were meant to be heard on vinyl. I listen to the remastered stuff, and it's just as good, but it's just not the same.  




 Urinal.  




 I loved Kanye when he first blew up, hated him when he was shown to be a selfish asshat, then loved him when... oh wait, I still hate him.  




 You can buy or trade killstreak kits, find them in crates, or get them as drops in Two Cities MVM tours. TF2 wiki can tell you all.  




 Says the filthy presser. 




 It's not unlimited data, they throttle at 1 gb. 




 ....huh. You're right on the money. 




 Is there any type of pattern, or is it just too random to make any educated guesses? 




 C'mon, let it run down. Not only will this bring up new flair, but it creates a larger area of time that will cause fewer people to hit it at once, thus less unintentional purples.  




 I still have mine too, in the collectors edition box I bought at circuit city, along with the manual and dvds, but I lost the figure that was included. Statesman, it was. This was issue 3 I think, right before the big nerf. As soon as I heard about them talking about it on the radio I grabbed it on the way home after work. One of the greatest buys of my life.
