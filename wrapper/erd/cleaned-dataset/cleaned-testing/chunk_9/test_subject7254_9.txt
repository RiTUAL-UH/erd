 Because it gets Democrat votes. 




 He finally tells the truth!

We all know those American-made Tow missiles wreaking havoc on Syrian armor didn't grow on trees. 









 Don't take my word for it.

"The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of islam"

-Barack Hussein Obama, born Barry Soetoro 




 Who cares what this physicist says? I'm a redditor with a Bachelor's in Urban Studies and i just *know* global warming is real. 









 TIL: Redditors want to ban ideas. 




 ISIS fighters out on bail in the US.

Fundamental transformation complete! 









 But....Bush!!!!


Do you know Obama has been President for **seven** years? 




 More cultural enrichment brought to you by the Democratic National Committee! 









 Too bad peasant.  Someone in government knows better than you do.

Now go read a book in the dark under your carcinogenic CFL lightbulb. 




 Looks like you can't tolerate a viewpoint contrary to your own very well.

Now that's bitter. 




 Socialism is causing the collapse of Greece right before our eyes.

However, for some reason, the Social Justice Warriors of Reddit think it will work in the US.

 














 Because having a centralized government in charge of educating children has never gone wrong. 




 110k African immigrants being placed in Minnesota.

Fundamental transformation of America?  Yes we can! 









 This is what happens when you have a rogue President who orders ICE and the BP to stop enforcing laws.

 




 But...but..all the super smart redditors say that immigrants who begin their stint in America by evading federal authorities will actually be peaceful, productive citizens.

Trump was right. 




 The progressive left will side with radical Islam over Christians.  You can take that to the bank.  It's already happening in Europe  









 Another example of progressive totalitarianism, where even children are subjects of the omnipotent state. 









 The free market used to work well in health care before the federal govt got involved with Medicare/Medicaid and prices went through the roof.

Doctors used to make house calls. That is what the free market is capable of. 









 Every news story happened in the past. 




 This article was about people attacking Christians for simple holding signs.

Feel free to comment on the article.  I'll leave you with a quote re: leftist violence.

"I want you to argue with them and get in their faces"
-Barack Obama

Not exactly the words of tolerance. 




 If a black/gay/liberal person was beaten at a Tea Party rally on video the state run media would be orgasming 24/7.

Everyone is equal, but some are more equal. 




 Beaten for holding a sign. 

The left is very tolerant, given you have the same opinion as them. 









 Anti-NRA liberals who say they own guns are like people who say they have a black friend to prove they aren't racist.

It's a desperate and pathetic plea for legitimacy. 




 No one here even knows what Trump said that was so offensive.

Everything he said is true.

 




 What exactly did Trump say that was so offensive? 









 9 out of 10 redditors have no clue what Trump said.

What he said was fact.  Trump is on target and that's why the left is so hyperdefensive about this.
 




 Correct. Liberals are usually humanists. Nothing is more important to them than their own whims. Kids and fetuses be damned. 




 He did not pull out of Afghanistan.

75% of military casualties and 92% of Marine casualties in Afghanistan have occurred under Obama.

 



















 You know it's actually okay to not believe in something but recognize people's Constitutional right to it?

American progressives seem to have a problem separating what they personally believe and what they believe should be a federal mandate  




 This is the Stalinism of the American left and it is only getting worse. 









 They are millions of separate lone wolves with a coincidental religious preference! 




 Once you start banning symbols bad things happen. 









 The cowardly left has never stood up against Islam and never will.

They are too busy embracing subservient collectivism and denouncing disparate ideas.  Sort of like Islam.... 




 Liberals do best in herds.

They are intimidated by the rugged individualism needed to survive in man country. 









 Excerpt from the Dissenting view:

"But this Courts two decisions on the Act will surely be remembered through the years. The somersaults of statutory interpretation they have performed (penalty means tax, further [Medicaid] payments to the State means only incremental Medicaid payments to the State, established by the State means not established by the State) will be cited by litigants endlessly, to the confusion of honest jurisprudence. And the cases will publish forever the discouraging truth that the Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites." 




 And the "Give me my free stuff" crowd goes wild.

The Republic has 30 years left, max. 




 Massive child rape by Muslim immigrants coming soon to a neighborhood near you! 









 Because the Confederacy was like the worst thing that happened ever in history bro.  




 Are there any symbols out there that don't offend anyone at all?
 














 Celebrate Diversity!! 




 The Gadsden flag, a symbol of the American revolution, is already reviled by the left.

It will be next, because it's somehow "racist".

All non-conformist thought will be deemed racist, banned and the purveyor will be "re-educated". 




 Just like bakers are free to regulate the content of the cakes they create? 




 The left is showing their true fascist tendencies on this one.

Don't ignore it, turn it off, change the channel, try to debate it.

If you disagree with it, ban it! 









 What flag do we ban to stop the EPIDEMIC of black on white violence in the US? 




 "The future does not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam."

-Barack Hussein Obama 









 Sanders is an outright communist and will not win a general election.

By all means, support him in the Democrat primary!

-Your local conservative 




 Not with that attitude. 




 In other shocking news, the Reddit mob doesn't criticize the actions of someone doing a job they have no clue about. 




 You are so naive. 




 "Bring the human population down"

Why don't we start with you? 




 College kids: They are unaware they are unaware. 




 Has Jon Stewart figured out the difference between the national deficit and the national debt yet?

Don't get your politics from an entertainer. 




 Unbeknownst to the naive college students of Reddit:

Sanders can not win a general election.

Hillary can not win a general election.

Keep pushing for them, please! 




 We do have a real problem.  

We prescribe  SSRIs to children. 




 The FCC, making up Constitutional powers as they go.  














 I'm really enjoying the Obamabots doing logic somersaults trying to change the meaning of this sentence.

**"At some point we have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."** 




 You do know the 'Americas' is referring to North and South America? 




 The left loves to discriminate against people based on their income. 




 There have been plenty of spree killers in other countries.  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rampage_killers):

Africa/Middle East	85

Americas	107

Asia	127

Europe	94

Oceania/Maritime Southeast Asia	124

Has Barack Obama **ever** said anything nice about America? 









 That very policy would have prevented the Boston Marathon bombing. 




 But just think of all the cultural enrichment they'll provide! 









 This is more naive liberal outrage over a reality that conflicts with their worldview of fuzzy unicorns.

For some strange reason, Reddit was silent about Obama using the term "typical white person" in his book. 




 Democrats do this all the time.  Reddit is silent. 




 And the left's revision of history continues.

Can't have any of those evil white men being idolized any more. 




 Funny.  There is criticism of Trump on Reddit, but no criticism of Elizabeth "I have high cheekbones so I can lie about my Native American ancestry" Warren.
