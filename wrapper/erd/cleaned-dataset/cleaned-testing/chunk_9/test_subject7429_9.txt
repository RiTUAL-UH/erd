 Pueblo is like the asshole of CO. 




 He was in the first season of Peaky Blinders on Netflix! 




 Oh my god, it happens to me too xD 




 Seriously, you don't even need to use ward. I used Spellbrealer. 




 A punchcat is a Khajiit that is unarmed because they have a bonus for it due to claws. 




 19 year old student with no motivation and barely slipping by in college.  




 11 year old WRX. Student still not sure what he wants out of life. 




 I don't believe in them

 I have a 60 too, but that's because I wanted to be the 200,000th press. And I fucking was.  




 Dude, I fucking love the Saabaru. Seeing one is like seeing a unicorn. 




 My dog stole one and hid it in my pillows a couple years ago. 




 ME ME ME 




 Mac because my name is McCoy. 




 Update the WRX/STI engines! 




 No. You were close, though. It's Bendydick Bandersnatch. 




 Such an underrated letter. 




 OMON, actually. 




 I wouldn't know about him. 




 I think the thing with that is that he genuinely seems to be happy with whatever he's got. He's not super picky. 




 DeVito can be anything you want him to be. 




 That would be hilarious 




 I'll bet you wouldn't regret it, dude! 




 I want the DeVito thing. 




 Man, that sucks. I haven't seen Silent Planet, but I've seen Defeater before and they put on an awesome show. 




 I've currently got tickets to go see Defeater and Counterparts and I may go see Silent Planet this month. 




 Not much, but my great (x6) grandfather fought in the Texas Revolution. We still have the deed to the land he was given and everything. That's really the farthest we've looked into our lineage. 




 My friends tried to kick my sister out of our prom group because they didn't like her boyfriend at the time, so I put them on the spot and told them how shallow and rude it was to do something like that. Stand up for yourself, dude. They're being immature. If they can't see that, then fuck them. Go to prom without them and enjoy yourself. 




 I love the shit out of this car. No question, I would buy it again. 




 I absolutely agree. 




 I personally think the AW11 kicks both their asses. 




 Heh. 




 Pfft. Who needs that shit anyway? 




 Lincoln Town Car Rally Sport Package 




 If that's usually the case, I feel lucky that my major prof gave us the book for a $1 and another prof gave us one of the books for free. 




 Worth it. 




 It was awesome. They were in a small-ish venue and it was perfect. 




 I'm not a huge TWA fan, but they definitely put on a good show. 




 The new song is a lot like the newer albums how it was a little slower then the earlier stuff and heavier. 




 They played one new song and it was actually pretty good. If you're talking about the newer stuff that's already out, they actually played a pretty even amount of songs from all of their albums, so there were only 2 or 3 songs off of 8:18. They still sounded great though! 




 I just got back from the Denver show. Probably one of my top 3 shows. 




 Prada fucking killed it in Denver. 




 Same. My old vans are perfect. 




 Have you read the Sandman graphic novels? 




 Me too! 




 I fucking love Listener. 




 I'm 19. I haven't been in a relationship since middle school and I don't count that. 




 I was just thinking the same thing. Sandman could only work if it was very high budget and would need to be cast really well. 




 I'm going to see Defeater for the second time on their headliner and couldn't be more excited! 




 The Honda Element has a pretty good amount of space and can be found pretty cheap. I also used to have a Suzuki SX4 and it was surprisingly spacious for what it was. 




 I agree. I loved that movie as a kid. Haven't seen it for a good while. 




 I was at that show, dude.  Fucking awesome! 




 I hope so, I'm a pretty big Mad Max fan so I'm looking forward to this game. :) 




 Here's some gameplay from 2013. That's all I could find. http://youtu.be/ON6MEqe8Lrg 




 Really?! That's awesome! 




 Honestly, that's what I would prefer. I just think Bioware is more likely. I loved KotOR 2 though. Even with the unfinished story, it was awesome. 




 I really hope that EA lets Bioware do another KotOR. Like so bad. 




 My school didn't have FSAE which is what I was looking for, but they had SAE Baja. Which, in my opinion, may be a little more fun. ;) 




 I always liked racing games and car shows, but I never really got into cars until I actually *had* a car. 




 Simulacra. 




 How did their hats stay on their heads then? 




 Am from Boulder. Own Subaru. 




 Wait.   I just restarted my computer and now it isn't working again.  Damn. :/ 




 I saw Of Mice   Men on their first headliner.  They were with ISMFOF, Woe, Is Me, Sleeping with Sirens, and The Amity Affliction.  It was pretty awesome. 




 That worked! Thanks so much! 




 My laptop says it's connected and some sites (like reddit) are loading, but almost all of them just load for a minute and then time out. I just did all the driver updates my computer said it had, restarting, scanning for malware, and checking my most recent installations, and I can't really think of anything else to look for. This on my school's Internet and I checked my friends computer and it loaded everything just fine, so I don't think it's a problem with the school. I'm using windows 7, Intel i7-4810. If you need to know anything else, just ask. Thanks for any help.

Edit: I forgot to mention that my computer says my connection is fine and a speed test says I am getting 15 Mbps. 




 Toyota FJ has a manual and you get a bonus windshield wiper at no extra cost! 




 If you click on the no photo available, it actually shows you the cover. 




 My friend had fucking DOOM on his calculator. Math appliances have come so far. 




 Oh, I do. :) 









 I used to drive one. They're great little cars. 




 I read something that put it perfectly. It was along the lines of "Drive is so stuffed full of obvious symbolism and themes that they couldn't even try to fit in substance or a plot." 




 If you're in Denver, I was at the Periphery show too! That entire show kicked some serious ass! 




 Anything by the band Fun. 




 My mom used to have one and they're about as comfortable and spacious as it gets for road trips. 




 Definitely. I kind of hope they become rivals like the Evo and STI. 




 The rarest I've seen was a Noble M600.  Haven't gotten to ride in any rare ones. :/ 




 The new Focus RS is AWD and should have at least 320 horsepower. 




 Seriously. I was wearing a purple hoodie and a girl said purple was a good color on me. It was honestly kind of alien to me how much it upped my mood. 




 Pfft, Tokyo Drift is the best one. 




 Fuck, I still listen to this album regularly. 




 I actually just finished In Bruges, finally. I actually really liked it. I thought I was going to be disappointed because it seemed to be getting overhyped here, but I was pleasantly surprised. 




 To clarify, it's 4 *seasons* it's actually got 88 episodes and then a movie. 




 Go for it. It's hard to go wrong with Brand New. 




 Now I'm alone in bed since 7:30 on New Years Eve, still kind of freaking out.

This sucks. 




 Get a clown horn. 









 Jesus, like 100k+ mile STis can still go for US$20k or more where I am. 




 The worst part is that I swear I've read this fucking story before! How did I not remember the end?! 




 1 lb 




 Thanks, that means a lot :)
