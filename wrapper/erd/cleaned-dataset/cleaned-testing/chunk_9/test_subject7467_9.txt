 That's what a pill, or iud is for 




 Stupid bitter lettuce 




 Abbott is largely considered an asshat. If young people could be convinced to vote he wouldn't be in office. 




 Yharnamite blood.  




 Just got kicked 




 Denton has the worst roads. It's like gangs of giant men go around attacking the street with sledgehammers every night 




 I don't get it. The company willingly put your life on the line for profit 




 Why did you go through all that effort? When it's 86 it's 86 man 




 The field of penis enlargement has really taken off 




 Fallout Gundams! I'd call it the vault destroyer 




 You've never been so mad at something you shit in it? I envy your Zen like nature 




 Downloaded this today and got to level 8, but I have no idea what I'm doing. Is it capture the flag? Are there matches or is it just a constant fight? 




 That sounds like a pretty dope job. I would sell my soul for that 




 Normie sub shops killed pepe 




 What area? I've always wanted to see one 




 Bajingo 




 Lol. Socialist/communist plus an anarchist. I love the system, but I hate the system.  




 You really can return anything to Wal-Mart 




 That makes sense, but I think it could have been handled better. Besides the brotherhood thing, house really seems like the best option. It's just uncharacteristically evil. He should have been more like some Machiavellian character 




 I've always really liked the brotherhood. I thought their whole mythos was really cool. They just don't feature very prominently in NV.  




 Yea it just seems really out of character. I've solved every thing else diplomatically for him, and now I have to kill this group for no reason 




 I helped Cass and now they hate me unfortunately 




 Does it bother anyone else that you can't get him to side with the brotherhood? The biggest issue for me is that I love energy weapons, and destroying them for house really kind of puts me in a hard spot. 




 Right? Just do it 




 That seems impossibly large. There's no recovering from that, right? 




 It's not weed. They only expand your body, not your mind 




 They belong in silent hill 




 It looked really, really cool.  




 That you're generalizing a group of people 




 Wait so is this a bad thing? Like everyone has each other's back in this image? Helping their fellow man kinda thing?  




 Well now I really don't get it 




 I do not miss going to church 4+ times a week.  




 What's your psn?  




 Practice makes perfect 




 I'm on level three in this dungeon and I am getting my ass kicked. I would appreciate any help. Also this is my first time posting, so let me know if I left something out 




 No, you just don't get it 




 The moon 




 Well first of all he wouldn't even get the piggyback ride 




 Well aren't you just a fine young capitalist?

 Error 




 Those goddamn spice merchants! 




 Neckbeards can't tell the difference between nudity and sexuality 




 We're going back in the closet. You are too accepting now 




 Like a unicorn? You want police with chainsaw horns? 




 The aroma is part of the allure 




 the perfectly reasonable crime 




 It's like life came about in some sort of world without food being available 24/7 




 By that logic the academy award for best picture should go to whatever that years summer blockbuster is 




 Eat like two hundred capsules of baking soda, then chug a 40 of vinegar.  




 Insane cherub posse 




 So just thrust furiously for 97 seconds? 




 Fists. My only weakness 




 Like a sack of greasy burgers 




 I want this power.  




 Thanks marg! 




 Dog 




 Same thing happened to me. I fell off a ledge in the woods and there were aliens. Definitely the weirdest moment I've had in a game in a while 




 Lose yourself in spaghetti 




 Fuck you - you're wrong! 




 I hope there's a steph curry aiming perk 




 Sessler looks like lex luthor 




 Hadrian? 




 Bloody mess. Duh 




 Sometimes you're a character in someone else's story 




 I was at the bottom of lake meade when Victor rolled up to say Howdy. We had a nice conversation, at the bottom of the lake. No rebreather equipped either 




 Just ill tempered sea bass 




 We legalized it in my time there. Also one city voted to end democracy. Boys from every part of Texas 




 We have those everywhere around here. They are pretty and stay out if the way. I like to think they're a feature of the garden 




 I'm halfed! 




 This dude looks blazed and he's wearing a wu tang shirt. I'm calling shenanigans 




 Massive balls 




 I must have missed this subs enlightenment. I didn't realize we were punching faces for truth and justice now 




 What are you talking about? The posts here are literally titled " want to make him choke on his teeth" there is no empathy here.  




 Lol. This is a sub about punching people in the face.  




 Dumbass.  




 I mean the game comes out in less than a month.  




 Give me another good setup and I can knock it out of the park again 




 Fatty 




 Found the fatty 














 Comics science 




 Get a bottle of JB 




 O ok definitely didn't understand it as a cat tax. I just thought you casually admitted to tax fraud while showing some kittens you found in a dumpster.  




 Build a giant high tech underground lair for all my cool toys 




 Nope. I'm not big into guns and lean towards gun control, but I still know proper gun safety and how to shoot. I might not like them but it would be extremely naive to not know how to use one. Guns are everywhere add one day you might find yourself having to use one. Same logic as learning to drive a manual 




 #courage 




 But Spain is an officially recognized country and has been for a very long time. The CSA was a short lived separatist movement designed for the sole purpose of keeping slaves. Flying the CSA flag is like flying the IRA flag. 




 Those musta been the lake forest killers! 




 The south seceded so they could keep slaves. That's what the flag stands for, a group of states who left the union so they could own slaves.  




 What an odd thing to admit to in this sub.  




 Except the only reason the CSA flag exists is because of slavery. The confederacy only existed to holds on to the institution of slavery. It doesn't matter which southern glad you fly, they all advocate slavery.  




 RIP grammar

 The urge to destroy cute things is called cute aggression FYI. It's completely normal 




 Is fallout popular in Japan?  




 Geez grow up already

 Oh God his knowledge of topics is rustling my gina jimmies 




 No console release... 




 There's no way they would do that. It would be a huge shitstorm and rightfully so 




 Femshep confirmed 




 If I'm not Dragonborn in fallout 4, then I don't want to play 




 You don't love the plastic robotic motions? 




 I would love a cool map like skyrim has 




 It wasn't enough tampons, right? 




 Looks like a magic card 




 Actually I did watch a little bit of attack on titan. It was pretty good 




 All hail minos! 




 That's why he's so angsty 




 The dickboob, duh.
