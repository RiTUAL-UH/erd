 Like a dairy cow, a pig uses its tail not only to shoo away insects but also to communicate. Like dogs, pigs wag their tails when they are happy, twitch them when they are nervous, let them drop straight down when they are sick. They may stick them straight out behind them when they are frightened or alarmed.

 There are people starving in Africa! Lets feed perfectly good food to animals and then slaughter the animals so that we can get back only a small fraction of the food. That will show those starving people how much we care! 




 Okay, so supposing that is true we ought to take the suffering of plants into consideration as well when deciding how we ought to behave. 

Which do you think causes less plant suffering: Feeding plants to animals then eating animals or consuming plants directly? 




 One thing I have been pondering doing is getting a bunch of vegan cookies then going to a college campus and offering them as free samples. However, I would put them out on two plates titled "regular chocolate chip cookies" and "vegan chocolate chip cookies". 

I would set up cameras to record the whole thing and tell people that I'm hoping to get feedback on the recipes and ask them what they thought about both. I think people's reactions would make for an interesting video.

**Ingredients**

* 1 can chickpeas, reserving a small handful for the avocado cream (you can cook dried ones as well)
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 small onion
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* A BIG bunch of both fresh parsley and coriander
* Salt and pepper
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 3/4 cup chickpea flour (sometimes called gram flour)
* Burger buns and fresh tomato for serving

**For the avocado cream and tahini mayo**

* 1 avocado
* A small handful chickpeas left from can
* A bunch of fresh parsley
* 1 garlic clove
* 2 tablespoons tahini
* The juice of one lemon
* 2 tablespoons water

**Directions**

Throw your chickpeas, peeled garlic, onion, cumin and salt and pepper into a food processor and pulse until roughly blended. Youll need to scrape down the sides. Now add in the fresh herbs, oil and flour and blend until you have a nice thick texture, but it will still be fairly moist. Place into a bowl and if you need, add a little more flour to help the mixture bind as you form them into the patties. Make them small or big as you prefer. In a flat frying pan, heat about half an inch of oil over medium to high and add in your burgers. Cook for about 4 -5 minutes on both sides and once they are on their second turn, press them gently to make them flatter if you need. They should turn a nice dark, golden brown and smell divine!

For the avocado cream, simply add to your processor the avocado (without skin of course!), the remaining chickpeas, parsley and 1 garlic clove and blend until smooth. For the tahini mayo, drop the two tablespoons of tahini into a small bowl with the lemon juice and water and whisk with folk until you have a creamy consistency.

Toast the bun, add the burger, then the avocado, then a slice of tomato and finish with the oozy, lovely tahini mayo!

 I think we need to hold a vote. All those in favor of swallows being vegan upvote this comment. 




 Good news! You actually don't need any nutrients from meat! You can live a happy and healthy life as a vegetarian!

According to the [American Dietetic Association](http://www.eatright.org/WorkArea//DownloadAsset.aspx?id=8417):

It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

Similarly, the [British Dietetic Association](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts) describes veganism as a type of vegetarian diet and continues:

Well planned vegetarian diets can be both nutritious and healthy. They have been associated with lower risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain types of cancer and lower blood cholesterol levels.

Well planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of life.

The position of the Australian Government's [National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55_australian_dietary_guidelines_130530.pdf) is that:

Appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthy and nutritionally
adequate. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle.

Finally the [Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx) state:

A vegan eating pattern has many potential health benefits. They include lower rates of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Other benefits include lower blood cholesterol levels and a lower risk for gallstones and intestinal problems.

This eating pattern can take some extra planning. Vegans must make sure that enough nutrients like protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamins D and B12 and omega-3 fats are included.

A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors. 




 I feel like I had [a very similar discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3d0yof/til_the_daily_water_footprint_of_a_person_eating/ct0z06t?context=3) with someone else in this thread who tried to make everything about me instead of actually looking at the consequences of their own actions.  




 You might find /r/vegrecipes and /r/veganrecipes to be useful resources for finding meal ideas. Everyone's tastes will differ, but if you look through the top posts you can see what a lot of people have enjoyed. 




 It must be due to lack of fiber. 




 I'm not forcing you to do anything. I will give you reasons why choosing to cut out animal products is a substantial and important thing to do to lessen the harm you cause to others, but that is all. 




 Causing less harm to others is better than causing more harm. It makes you a better person to choose the former.

I don't care if I'm better than you or not. You should care about trying to be the best person you can be. 




 Animals suffer as individuals, not as a species. 

Imagine we lived in the world of the Matrix where humans were bred by the tens of billions to be used for energy. Our concern should be the well-being of humans as individuals, not the fact that we would go from a population of 50 billion humans down to a more reasonable 7 billion if we stopped humans from being bred excessively. 

Our concern for other animals ought to be the same. There is value in preserving biodiversity, but our primary concern should be for the well-being of the individuals. 




 Any diet needs to be planned appropriately in order to be healthy. No dietetic association is going to say a certain diet is healthy without caveats to ensure that it meets all our nutritional needs.  




 Yeah, using less water is so stupid...

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein

Roast for about 25 minutes, flipping once, or until sweet potatoes are fork tender. Let cool for a few minutes.

3. Place all of the veggie burger ingredients into a food processor and process for about 3 - 5 seconds until everything is mixed together but still has some texture to it. Form patties (you should get about 6 of them depending on the size you make) and place them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Chill in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes.

4. Heat a large pan over medium heat and coat the bottom with a thin layer of olive oil. Place burgers in the hot pan and cook for about 10 minutes, flipping once, until burgers are heated through.

5. If grilling the burgers, grill over medium heat and rub a little bit of olive oil on the grill to ensure that the burgers don't stick.

6. Top veggie burgers with curry cilantro mayo and enjoy on a bun with toppings of your choice! 









 A small-scale, local, "humane" pig farmer reveals several of the ethical issues that still exist with such methods of raising animals for slaughter, including the issue of pigs who are the last ones remaining alive in the slaughterhouse after all of their companions have been killed, what he describes as the so-called "Last Pig Problem".

 Nothing you do can overcome all of the biases people will have against veganism. You can do some things to overcome a lot of it, but there is nothing you can do that will make everyone open to fairly considering what you have to say.

Appearance plays a big role in getting people to take you seriously. You will do much better if you have a clean haircut and decent clothes.

Another important aspect is to use as mainstream of sources as possible. Don't use Freelee as a banana girl as a source to support why you think vegan diets are healthy, reference the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Finally, act like you understand where people are coming from. You don't need to condone the consumption of animal products, but if you acknowledge people's experiences and beliefs they will be much more willing to hear you out. 




 Well since you're asking... [Here's a picture of my package](http://i.imgur.com/HX4AKLU.jpg) 




 But fewer slaves would have been better than the alternative. In fact, while people were pushing for abolition, they were also abstaining from products like tobacco and sugar that were produced by slaves, choosing alternatives instead.  




 not just for the people who were freed, but also for people who would never be born to suffer the injustice of slavery. 




 When Britain passed the Slave Trade Act 1807 the only people who became slaves were people who were bred and born to be slaves. I think we can both recognize that it still made a difference to abolish slavery outright, not just for the people who were freed, but also for people who would never be born to suffer the injustice of slavery. 




 It makes a world of difference for the animals who are not suffering and dying as a result. This has made more difference for these animals than increasing cage space or slowing growth rates ever could.

  I will continue to eat ~~whatever~~ **whoever** I want

Animals are not objects. They are individuals with desires and interests of their own. An ethical person needs to take into account the impact their actions have on others when deciding how to behave. 




 I'm not a big fan of Chorizo, but I use their ground meat product often to make homemade chili or a meaty pasta sauce. 




 The food chain isn't an ethical theory. It doesn't tell you how you ought to behave any more than the water cycle tells you not to dam rivers or build canals. 




 There is more to determining how you ought to behave than simply stating what you enjoy. You also need to consider the impact your actions are having on others. 




 The issue is that people go to the store and see packaging with green pastures and happy animals and believe that is how the animals are raised. People see terms like "humane" and "organic" and are similarly deceived into picturing unrealistic conditions. However, when undercover investigators go and film the facilities behind these labels the resulting footage is always cramped conditions and incredibly cruel treatment.
