 Now, I'm really interested to know how many taco bell restaurants he is worth.  




 This is awesome! I love hourglass pieces and this one is really unique! 




 Dating sites, bars, activities...Friends are overrated!! 




 Being blind without a doubt, I can't even handle closing my eyes around other people... 




 I'm in love with this.  




 You're welcome! :) 




 They're actually glass with a 'cracked' pattern in them! I got them from arctic buffalo: http://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/plugs/products/purple-cracked-glass-plugs










Also in pink: http://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/plugs/products/light-rose-cracked-glass-plugs 




 That's awesome! Most people really want realistic photograph quality stuff and I actually find the tattoos that aren't to be more interesting! 


Okay, good! :)  




 The quality of line in this isn't on par as far as crisp and clean goes...did you want it in that 2D hand drawn style? If not I would consider going else where. 


Not trying to sound snarky at all by the way, I apologize in advance. 




 Feel like I should take a drink every time this has lice listed as another item on the list. :P 


Seriously though this sucks,  









 I meant combination as in using crochet for maintenance! I need them to be very neat(as neat as dreads can be) because I work in a business casual setting on a daily basis.  




 Please refer to title, and I have fine relatively straight  shoulder length hair BUT I already use dollylocks bar shampoo and sea salt spray! :)  




 You should really ask the artist you want to tattoo you...Look at their work, if you like their portfolio book a consult. Tell them exactly what you want in as much detail as you can with a defined budget. Then, they should show you this design before your appointment. 


Also, if you do this just as a tip taking the design someone draws for you and getting it tattooed elsewhere is a no no. And give them as much warning as possible if you need to cancel... 




 This really is porn, holy shit. I would sell my soul for an apartment this nice.  




 I just pull my bottom eyelid enough to get it slightly open and dive bomb a bunch in. it works because the bottom lid will catch all the visine! Be prepared to spaz after though, that shit stings! 




 Dammit Dynamite, this is totally me...How do you know this, are you the one watching me?  




 I use bedhead, dirty secret dry shampoo and it works perfectly...I tried tresemme, dove, and other brands before this! Only one I would even dream of recommending. Dove also stained my brown hair white. 


Also, make sure you're holding it far enough away from your hair and that you're spraying it through the layers if its longer...
 




 This poor fucker, what did they eat... the table? I can't imagine dealing with that many food allergies daily. 




 Makes me want to get real cuticles tattoos, so nice! Good job OP, on the nails as well.
