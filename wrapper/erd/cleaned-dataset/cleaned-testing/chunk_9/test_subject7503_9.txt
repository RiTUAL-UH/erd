 You think that was hot fire? He has a mix tape droppin next week. 




 Name checks out. 




 Because we are backing the cartels. We've givin them weapons, had our CIA agents party with them, and have allowed them to operate so they can feed us info on other cartels we don't like. 

Plus without cartels we wouldn't have a war on drugs. No war on drugs means no asset forfeiture, less people in jail, less work for cops and prision guards and most importantly no reason for states to recieve money and military grade hardware from the fed. 

I'm probably wrong, and I hope I am l. But givin what I've seen done by our government I doubt I am. 




 Body massage.  




 No. 

Crazies gonna crazy. 




 And I would of gotten away with arresting them too if it wasnt for that pesky constitution. 




 Now if we could ge rid of that lying, manipulate cunt Pao we could have another 10 years. 

I'll give her the $2.7 million, if she steps down as CEO and fucks off reddit forever. 




 Just imagine if someone wrote this type of letter to the police. Just think about what they would do to that person.  




 This is not a political or racist terrorist attack. Not at all. This is just another attack on the Christian faith. - Fox News 




 YOU FINALLY DID IT TWC! YOU ARE OFFICIALLY NUMBER ONE! 




 I don't see the issue here. Our black president said "nigger" while talking about racism. 

Just imagine all the people who have called Obama a nigger over the years, but yet when the black president says it, its national news. 




 Ah yes the hypersensitive sjws are at it agian. Making everywhere a "safe space" free from those icky truths that are so very problematic and triggering. 

Thank god these people exist to protect my poor little feefees from the harsh unforgiving world. I'm so glad that after I've finished my degree in gender studies, these people will always be there to tell me how to act and what to say so I don't unintentionally trigger someone.

 Beat me to it. 




 Greetings earthlings working at tumblr,

My name is fggggjdsbzrt (fggg/fgggg pronouns please) I come from a future planet that hasn't been made yet. I'm here to tell you that the site you are running is mine. The future says so. So I'm gonna need everyone to shut down the site or I'm going to tell lord Xenu on you.

Regards from the future,
 fggggjdsbzrt 




 Lol nope, Destiny isn't even that good of a game to begin with. When I borrowed it from a friend I could only fight that big black ball thing twice before I realised that the whole point of the game is to grind and hope you get good rng. 

Now bungie is telling people "If you want the true experience buy the game agian for more money and get these emoticons :)" No thank you bungie. As someone who went to a halo 2/3 midnight release and supported bungie by buying Halo 1-3 it hurts to say that I will not ever buy anything made by bungie again. Well until they fix this shithole they turned in to that is. 




 You best be talking about the "in water" ending buddy. 


Dog end is fine too.

 Your right. Some set out to be hateful and crazy echo chamber that is so fragile it must ban anyone who doest toe the line or deviates from the group think.

Hold on, I'm gonna need a ladder for this kek. 




 If found guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt, with solid evidence I'm all for it. Especially crimes involving mass murder, spree killers, rape of a child, or things like those.  




 Well years and years of failed policies and brutality from the LAPD have created the threat of public backlash against them. So the fear of that causes them to shoot first bcause "they were in fear of their lives". 

 




 You forgot the parts about not having to reload and bad ass 80's  metal blasting over local P.A. systems. Oh and everyone has bald eagle that hovers above while carrying an American flag.  




 This actually happened to a friend of mine from my home town. I dont remember exact details (its been years), but basically he was taking care of his two sons after the mom left them to "start her life over" a state away, and somehow she managed to still have custody and wouldn't give it to my friend. 

So he had to pay child support to her, which went on a card, that he had. While the whole time she was a state away giving fuck all about them. 




 I'm a single father of my four year old daughter since day one. Her mother didn't want her and still doesn't want anything to do with her. 

So around the time my daughter was five months I get a call from the child support agency. I was told I had to come in and set up payments for her or jail. 

I made the appointment and took my daughter. Along with evidence of doctors visits, my wic, insurance, food stamps and letters from coworkers/friends/family all proving that I was doing it without her mothers help. 

The child support lady looked at all of it and told me that they would close the case against me and start one on her mom. Fast forward a year or so later and nothing. So I call and I get told that the case was never opened on her mom and that I'd have to go through courts to get one started.

I said fuck it. Now years later still no support or bday cards or Christmas gifts or anything from her mother. And that's fine she can have whatever life she wants and if that involves not being a parent thats her choice. 

But to think if the roles were reversed and I was the one who didn't want my daughter I would be paying child support or in jail.


 




 Its like sleepaway camp all over again.  




 This is the state of our country, the line between satire and real life has become one in the same. I am not even surprised anymore.

We have politicians who are bought by the highest bidder to shove an agenda that is bad for everyone but a few rich assholes. Democracy is dead, killed by backroom deals and corruption. 

In the "Land of the Free" we have a government that has implemented some of the following in our name. 

Rampant violations of the fourth amendment by the NSA.

Proxy wars orchestrated by the CIA (including drug smuggling and overthrowing governments).

Using the biggest tragedy in American history to start two failed wars, hundreds of thousands dead, billions of debt and a even more of a bad situation then when we went in. 
But the biggest part of this that destroys me about this is using the horrific deaths of thousands of innocent Americans, to pass the Patriot" act, that takes away our rights. 

Internal check points where citizens are told to prove citizenship (papers please). Not only that but these constitution-free zones are within 100 miles of our boarders, thats most of our population. 

A militarized police force. 

A failed, expensive and pointless war on drugs. That not only makes nonviolent people felons (no more vote), but turns people who have been doing what people have done for thousands of years into a crime.

There is so much more and these are only from my lifetime (28 years).  

I love my country. I love the rights granted to me as an American. I am thankful for the blood that was shead for these rights.

But when I see that rich fucks run for leader of the free world I can't even be phased anymore.  




 Triggered.  




 A collective "no shit" rings out across the land. 




 Sweet release. Rip in pepperoni birderoni.  




 That ending wcw promo got me right in the feels.

 I see the problem, you zigged when you should of zagged. The best way to fix that problem is by simply gettin good :) 




 That I'm gonna somehow sit on my balls someday and its gonna hurt.

Or that somehow I manage to turn out to be a bad father. 

Mostly the balls thing though, ouch.

 Good news is that three people were recording, so at least there is that.

 As someone from Ohio who now lives in SoCal here's a couple of things.

Its hot as fuck here. Its nice sunny days most of the time but since SoCal only has two seasons (hot and not as hot) it makes me miss snow.

Everything is pretty expensive.  Cost of living is pretty high.

God help you if you are driving and it happens to rain. People loose their minds, expect delays.

If your into smoking cannabis for medicinal or recreational reasons California is great for that. Dispensaries are fantastic. 

LA driving is fucked. Fuck turn signals apparently. 




 The fire rises. 




 Good on him. 









 Tfw you will never work on that fence with Plague. Basking in the steamy afternoon sun, and in the sight of sweaty dirty Plague bending down in his cut off jean shorts hammering things. 



 




 Social skills don't matter when you have so many red pills to drop. 




 I dunno if you know or not but /pol/ is always right. 




 I gave Plague shit about that fence around a month ago, the fenceing is eternal.

 I follow the guy who is translating If, he is still working on it and does post updates. So it is commin any day now. 

RemindMe! One Year "Any day now" 




 So tumblr? 









 Always. 









 I'm with ya, having people in jail or even in the legal system at all for cannabis is ridiculous.  




 What a thrill. 




 I can but not with as much swag as Bill Gates. 














 Im asking everyone who reads this to go show your support for the school and students right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Also while you are there remind the cops of their oath to those rights and to the constitution that grants them.  









 Top kek as they say. TOP KEK. 




 Religion is bad for the human race, it holds no relevance anymore. We are not the same as the people from 1,000's of years ago.

 Because you are an alcoholic.  




 Post this to /r/ProtectAndServe  and watch how fast the excuses fly and how fast you get banned.  









 Fuck em. 




 Unless they are high profile pedophiles. 
 














 I knew I fucked that up. I haven't had my coffee yet. 




 
I'm just pointing out the facts.

Fact is this fucking cop is going to get away with it. There is nothing to investigate, piggums bashed someone in the face with his fucking gun. Or are you saying they will find out that the gun he had on him jumped out on its own and proceeded to smash in guys face?

OP is the one with all the answers and is either using multiple accounts or a brigade. 

Yeah that's totally it. Ive made over 200 accounts just to upvote this. Its not like people are starting to wake up to the growing brutality and double standard cops gets away with. 




 Palestinians deserve their country back.  




 Whats this a sensible drug policy?! In my America?!

*edit Spelling is hard. 









 You and I both know damn well that's why they did it.  




 Its exactly what happened.  




 Donald Akers says, He held the gun first, I didnt know if he was going to shoot us or what.  But instead, he hit me right across the nose with it. Broke my nose, my sinus cavities, broke my teeth.  Once that happened, Janet Akers admits she fought back.  Bystanders broke up the fight.

She then called 911, and took some photos to document the scene.  So the police came, and went over directly to them. And were talking to them, laughing, joking around, recalls Janet, We feel like they knew him right off the bat.

If a regular person did that you know damn well they would of been arrested and charged on the spot. The fact this cop and his buddies joked around about assaulting a man with a deadly weapon shows you just how serious the "investigation" is going to go.  














 Fuck Police.

 2015

Still trying to flim flam the zim zam 




 All kinds, here is a list of some of them. 

A single mom who lives in a house. Only drank wine.

A white chick covered in tats who carried a pistol and sold/used hard drugs.

An Asian girl who was a total hippy, loved taking doses and shrooms. 

A mixed (black/white) collage girl who became my babys momma.

There is a buncha others. 

But now that Ive been a single dad for four years all I really want now is a woman who is an amazing, caring, loving mother type. Who has ambition and motivation. But she has to have an edge, quick to call me a cunt face fuck nugget and knows how to fuck like a porn star. 

Should be to hard to find right guys? 




 I watch more streams on twitch and e sport events than I do regular sports.

Ive never really been into watching sports even though I played soccer, baseball and three years of football as a kid. 

Just not my bag.

Baby. 




 Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS.

Come at me Egypt. 




 Take him out in the street and put a bullet in his head.

Not even once. 




 /r/tumblrinaction is the best place to go when you are feeling down. No matter how bad you feel you can always know that you are better than the idiots who get posted there  




 Poor lil goys.  




 I prefer to sacrifice a goat and let the blood fall onto my gay husbands buttocks, while I speak in toungs and smoke the devils lettuce. It gets the point across but man do I go through a lot of goats. 




 I don't get why these people are so against abortions. All they do is send babys to God and Jesus faster. 




 The NSA is about protecting the government not the people. If it was truly about protecting the people it wouldnt violate the people's rights on a daily basis. 




 Old white people. And billionaires who have bought them.

The American people are more or less sheep lead by tv news (who is told what to say by the goverment) and distracted by irreverent celebrities. The people here on reddit are a minority who loves to scream about the travesty our country is taking but none of us are willing to be the martyrs. Not one of us is willing to pick up a gun and go take out the trash, because it wouldn't matter. Some other shill will take their place while the news will spin the story into "Domestic Terrorist hates America we need more gun control/spying to keep us safe from the people in our own country who hate us." Also the voting system is rigged and rich politicians don't go to jail.

No we don't, we don't have enough money to buy one. 




 Welp looks like I'm going to forget paying taxes this year.  




 People let me tell you about my new best friend BARNABY JONES!
