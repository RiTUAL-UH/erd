 Yes. As a young arrogant teenager I thought it was school that needed to change, that it was the schools fault I wasn't succeeding. But actually it was my attitude, and looking back I needed a wake up call or two. 









 Yeah but turfing it on to neighboring suburbs isn't the answer with a kick/lock out isn't the best option. I only hope the bar owners take some responsibility here, however if their track record is anything to go by, it'll be the usual "we're not doing anything wrong, stop punishing us" mantra, where the blame is entirely deflected to a preloading culture rather than addressing the root cause. 
























 I get what you're saying, and perhaps I'm being too harsh, let me explain further.

I know I probably would have failed School cert, I certainly failed NCEA.

I know I'm not a fucking idiot as I'm not doing too badly in the game of life, but to fail and have beside the failure "Did not achieve" was insulting to say the least. 

I mean look at HTC for what happens everyone keeps telling them: "You tried your best, and that's ok" in relation to the M8. 
then they think mediocrity is acceptable, and release the M9. Then everyone blasts them for not being creative enough to produce a new device.

Does that make sense?  




 Ah no, it's not my business (I wish!), but very close family friends.
however thank you, I'll pass the feedback on. 

They're still growing (only started a few months ago and definitely understand they need to adapt to survive. 




 If you're in chch you can ask [Punky Brewster](http://www.punkybrewster.co.nz/) to get some in if you can't find it. 

Anyway, if you're keen, pop past for a tasting to see if there's anything you like. :) 




 No, education is to figure out your learning *potential.*  




 NCEA - "Where everyone is a winner"

Seriously, we totally fucking called this, as the guinea pigs there was a damn good reason why even the TEACHERS walked out of the schools when this was announced. 

This has been a ten year example in "why some people just need to be told they're fucking idiots" like School Cert did. 




 As /u/OldWolf2 said, you can indeed see them via your Portal. 




 Thanks, as mentioned earlier in this thread, does this change the bank account etc as well? Or is that best performed over the phone? 




 I guess that's one benefit, it's so old you wouldn't void your warranty by flashing it. 




 Indeed. The annoying thing is when you're sitting/standing there uhming and ahhing over the decision as to whether you should bother  they completely neglect to tell you any of this! 




 That's a good question, and worth people asking at the carrier's Facebook pages? 




 Indeed. However it's never nice to be told your device is going to be left behind despite the fact it's perfectly functional. 




 Yay! I got like 20c! :D Let's buy.. Uhm. what can you buy with a $1.18c? like half a litre of petrol? 









 I think we did complain, and that's when they told us to phone the IRD and get them removed as the Personal Tax Agent. IIRC whoever we spoke with CGAF. 




 This was before I knew about this, and now my wife and I use the IRD portal.

 Gun violence? What gun violence. We need less money spent on this useless gun violence. /S

I'm not shitting you [Quietly, Congress extends a ban on CDC research on gun violence](http://admin.pri.org/stories/2015-07-02/quietly-congress-extends-ban-cdc-research-gun-violence) 




 This happened to my wife last year, we requested a Personal Tax Summary and despite the fact they sent it twice it never arrived, we then worked out that "MyTaxRefund" had stolen 'primary contact' as my wife's Tax Agent.

The kicker here was that we had used them about 4 *years* prior and they received personal correspondence which they never bothered to pass on!

 "i was actually getting paid **less than what they said.**" fuck them, leave the company immediately. 




 And [The Press](http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/69926631/nz-herald-found-in-breach-over-ponytail-gate-article) have covered it as well, with a far clearer representation of the Press Council's finding. 




 You're quite right!

Edit: again for the TL;DR people:

**Para 1.:**
On April 23, the New Zealand Herald published, front-page and online, an article about Amanda Bailey and the controversy over her reaction to the Prime Minister, John Key, when he persistently pulled her ponytail at the cafe where she worked as a waitress.

**Para 3.:**
Lisa Finlay, Bronwyn Hayward, Leanne Hermosilla, Josh Hetherington, Rob Stowell, Jasmine Taylor, Giovanni Tiso, Daniel Webster and Julia Woodhall complained that the article breached several Press Council principles.

**Para 2.:**
The Press Council has upheld the substance of the complaints. This is a brief outline; for the full Press Council decision, in two parts, please see www.presscouncil.org.nz. 




 Ah, I recall that event. 

I have to admit that it would 100% appear like the Herald are closing ranks around the reporter, as this piece of drivel posing as a 'apology' does not explain anything akin to what you've just explained. Thank you /r/Hubris2, fantastic ELI5. 




 No, and frankly doesn't actually explain what the complaint was about.

The severely disjointed flow of this article- especially between paragraph 1 and 2 are extremely discombobulating. I had to read it like 3 times, for thinking there are a sentence or 2 I was missing. 

Paragraphs for the TL;DR crowd:


"On April 23, the New Zealand Herald published, front-page and online, an article about Amanda Bailey and the controversy over her reaction to the Prime Minister, John Key, when he persistently pulled her ponytail at the cafe where she worked as a waitress.

The Press Council has upheld the substance of the complaints. This is a brief outline; for the full Press Council decision, in two parts, please see www.presscouncil.org.nz." 




 Sorry, does someone mind ELI5 please? 




 I think I'll let Dr Cox basically summarise what you can expect from most people. [People are bastard coated bastards with a bastard filling.](http://i.imgur.com/dzT8R9h.png)

I'll say ths: What you do in your own damn time is your own damn business. Fuck everyone else. 




 Fuck, I'm an idiot, thought it was nz as nzherald didn't say. Fuck what a knob and fuck the useless shit fucking nzherald useless cunts. 
 









 No, they give you 15 minutes lee-way at the beginning of the fire process.

After 15 minutes, with most techniques you should have significant combustion of the wood.

Incomplete combustion, (and subsequently waste of wood) results in soot (carbon) in the atmosphere.

So if you have a good fire from kindling, and whack a log that's too big, or wet or contaminated for complete combustion to occur you get smoke/soot. This also causes expensive chimney blockages, and results in less heat being generated. 

So yes it's a pain in the ass, but actually proper techniques, and keep your fire smoke free is significantly better use of your wood, and subsequently cheaper. 
  









 I'm fucking angry, Chorus have fucked over NZ for absolute years, you wonder why your ADSL and VDSL is so shit? 

Chorus haven't invested anything other than the bare minimum of maintenance. Their 'Monthly access fee' for the average consumer is actually nothing more than cream on top, and the ComCom have once again proved the toothless cuntbags they are and are allowing this monopoly to continue to keep the price of the substandard bullshit we call internet extremely expensive when compared to other countries. 




 [Commissions first attempt at modelling this cost had come up with a proposed charge for landline access (required for broadband and/or voice services, and known as the UCLL Price) that was **80% higher than the median price in 14 other comparable countries**  and 60% higher than the next most expensive country.](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1502/S00682/spark-nz-calls-on-comcom-to-rethink-chorus-wholesale-charges.htm) 














 I think they were focusing on Lower Cashmere and St Albans first, then will get around to everyone else

 Indeed. More phones need them.

After lollipop I still find it significantly more convenient to use the scanner on my S5 over a typed/traced unlock. And even better it works in the dark without the need to stare the at the screen. 

Even a 3 swipe unlock I reckon is an acceptable tradeoff between none, and a pass code. 




 The TL;DR - 

Air pollution officers tasked with identifying woodburners that produce smoke for more than 15 minutes after ignition started patrolling on Monday.

By Wednesday nine warning notices had been issued - the initial phase of a process that culminates in a $750 fine. 









 .. Coming from the country [that put a woman behind bars for 3 months in **2009** for online harrassment.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1208147/First-cyberbully-jailed-Facebook-death-threats.html)

The register has thoroughly gone downhill recently. 




 I fully understand a bar is a place to socialize, and alcohol is engrained in or socialization culture. 

However going to be the pub, preloaded and buy only 1 beer, you're contributing to the demise of that pub, I don't know what the $$$ per head need to keep a pub open but it just be quite steep, rent doesn't pay itself! 

A few successful pubs like the Fox have a reward scheme, similar to a subcard, which seems to work. Perhaps if they liked further abroad than just jacking prices we may see more of a scene back again. 

That being said they are giving an uphill battle, in Chch it's stupidly hard to get a liquor license to sell anywhere, but this again makes me wonder why more bars don't look beyond jacking up prices to stay alive. It's not easy to run a business, but it's easy to ruin one.  




 Well that's it, and I'm sure you went out and got drunk out and about rather than pre loading?  




 It's a fucking rort ay, then bar owners actually complain no-one is buying drinks. It's like are you fucking stupid?  




 Stupid me. Being a paedophile is exclusively a man condition. 




 It's the native trim app, comes pre-installed. Thank you!  




 Make him wear a sign on the side of a main road "I'm a dirty arsonist". 




 You stupid cunts. 




 Hi /r/GalaxyS5.

Google was no help, so hopefully someone here can shed some light on this issue.

I use phone as a dashcam, and trim a lot of videos.

Recently after upgrading to lollipop when playing back videos in the Trim feature it plays back at 1.3x speed, and doesn't accurately portray the video length you've selected to crop.

I've deleted cache/clear data from "Video Trimmer" App, and disabled, rebooted, reenabled.
I've also cleared data from "Trim" app.

This happens on videos shot from my device, reading from both SD card and internal memory.

Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.

Cheers! 




 Indeed. I don't know if you recall but a school up north basically gave out Credits for wiping your fucking nose in order to beat the statistics and ensure they got funding! 

I can't find the particular story, [this](http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/latest-edition/318375/NCEA-battered-by-secret-report) is rather damning..

"THE FIRST major analysis of schools' NCEA marking shows many teachers are awarding better grades than examiners do with high-profile schools among the dozens suspected of marking too high.

This means students who shouldn't have passed NCEA may have. Others might have missed out on university entrance because their school marked tougher than others."

And you **really** wonder why this girl is complaining? 




 Indeed. I for instance failed miserably at NCEA, and my teachers constantly lamented, saying "why aren't you doing better than this!? I know you're smart, but you fail your exams!" my report is littered with "my name can do better" and I have done better since in the real world - I'm in good employment with a large multinational and earning a very decent wage for my young age.

I'm not saying I'm a special case, but I'm perhaps a bit too atypical  to fit within the NCEA curriculum, and as a result I was frustrated throughout high school as I felt like the exams weren't catered for different learning styles. 

From what I understand there was that leeway under the old school cert that you there were more than one ways to skin a cat, however under NCEA it was just a decision process that was extremely binary and linear. 

Again, fuck you Trevor Mallard (Education Minister at the time) you humongous cunt bag. 




 I came here with an anti vandal sentiment, and found the comments in here quite heartwarming and I honestly can't add anything meaningful or even add even more colorful language. Reddit you make me so proud sometimes. 




 Can we just realise for a second that most of the old timers here (well, those 28 and older) sat through a far more robust and time honoured teaching system. 

Kids nowadays are sitting through NCEA, a far cry from the old School Cert system.

NCEA isn't about learning at all, it's about gaining credits through an arbitrary system of points that are seemingly granted at whatever discretion some fuck thought was adequate.

There is no 'teaching' just a series of decisions which leads to more credits, or less credits, which are the used to either pass, or fail a course.

NCEA has totally fucked over our learning system, and this is the culmination of 10 years of tweaking a system that should never have survived the first year. 


Fuck you Trevor Mallard you fucked up you cunt.

I walked out of school in disgust back then, and would do it again in a heartbeat.  




 The law catches people who want to bludge off our extremely (by world standards) lenient benefit laws. This catches both the extreme criminals, and in her case perhaps someone too naive for her own good. Is it fair? Laws aren't designed to be fair, but to allow as many genuine people through while catching those who will be a (perceived) burden on the system. 

It's literally a game of numbers, and if you have more stacked against you, that's it. Fairness completely aside.  














 Shit, let's hope Sonny Tau doesn't catch wind of this.. 




 No, she was a well spoken 24 year old woman. However she said the old guy just gave her an extremely bad vibe from the beginning. 

To prove it really wasn't her -She sat it two weeks later and literally got 100% no shit.. Unfortunately this puts the pressure on me when I sit my Full! God knows I won't hear the end of it if I get anything less..  




 ~~Mature~~...real ~~mature~~.
Manure...real manure..

FTFY 




 I wish I was joking, but she was indeed declined for "using the incorrect terminology." Good to know, that makes me feel better for sitting my test soon. 




 How did you find "verbally identifying the hazards?" My wife failed to "properly identify the hazards" because she said stuff like "car coming towards me" instead of "oncoming". Then again she did take it at the Sockburn testing station, who have the biggest pack of old fucking stick-up-their-ass sexist arrogant fucktards with  a severe god complex. 




 NZHerald are really starting to scrape the gutter eh. 

It's like, you **really** think your average NZ wants this girl who lied (*7 months in and out of NZ on a 3 month tourist visa*), attempted to cheat the system (*I'm going to be a nanny and be paid with food and board, but it's totally not work because I'm family*) and was found out and now goes crying to the media?

I understand ignorance of the rules, especially with the nannying, however ignorance is no defence of the law unfortunately.  




 Thanks, that's a good TL;DR. 




 It's locked m by Samsung. It's not something that can be enabled by jailbreak. 


Will it be enabled by Samsung? Probably not because their marketing team are a pack of sanctimonious fucking assholes!! 

They had the opportunity to release it with lollipop, but chose not to. 

Furthermore when you look into Samsung's cunty decision riddled history you can see multiple instances of them being arrogant fucking douchebags and keeping the latest hardware agnostic software tricks to the latest galaxy rendition only, e.g. Themes on the s6. 

So I would not hold your breath. 

I love Samsung products, but fucking despise the piss poor level of after sales software support. 

Then you look at HTC who readily enabled raw to their one lineup.. 









 Added. My first random :-) 









 The media server can be to blame, in your battery usage you may see "media" or similar. 
This process is extremely buggy, runs often and crashes frequently.

Do you have media showing up?  




 I've removed this post as it's needlessly angry. You're right, they're both important events, is the apathy towards one and sympathy towards the other that's frustrating
 




 We do, Reddit /r/NewZealand does talk about tppa a lot, but most of my friends don't even know what it means, and frankly don't care.

It's fantastic America has finally seen the light, and can serve as another shining example of equal rights. This will also serve to further embarrassment for those countries (Australia for instance) who are yet to offer their citizens the same!  




 Have you taken a nice photo recently? 

Fuck I know the internet is anonymous, but did no-one in your sheltered life tell you "if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all?" Of course not, you were probably to fucking busy burning ants with a magnifying glass. 

Shut the fuck up if you don't appreciate someone else's effort.

Edit: that's a funky photo op!  




 This makes me so gutted Samsung aren't being sporting cunts and offering themes to s5 users.  




 Have a look at your screen modes, his may be set to dynamic?  




 Don't get me wrong, I'm arguing they're stupid, impatient and dangerous, but not an immediate threat to anyone.  




 Yeah nah I was going 60km/h prior to him pulling in front and slowing me to 40 ish.  




 I agree they're not an immediate threat, but if they do that ten times, they grow complacent about driving on the wrong side and eventually make a mistake while doing so.. 
 
I have an example: the lady that hit me recently, when she turned into the lane furthest from hers without looking, "you're the first person in years to turn at the same time as me" was her excuse and she honestly blamed me for turning at the same time as her despite the fact it's the law to say I can do so..  




 Yeah, but the quality of the boxes is very shit, they tend to freeze, and crash 




 Indeed. Made me miss the lights cause he felt like cutting me off. 
It was frustrating as all hell. 

The other two came ignored the yellow solid line, for what? To get their jollies off in scaring the shit out of anyone who came out of a driveway? 




 True.  









 So.. this is essentially a wee case study for how TPPA works. 




 Oh the irony is palpable. 




 Inspired by [this promotion by T-mobile](http://www.gsmarena.com/tmobile_now_lets_you_switch_smartphones_three_timaes_a_year-news-12794.php) "At any point, you can just swap your existing handset for another one that's part of the program. **You do have to give back your current model**, and it has to be in working order, but that's it." 




 They are slow, but my i9506, released Q3 2013 was just updated to 5.0.1 lollipop 2 years later, that's not bad! 









 I had to create [this](http://cdn.makeagif.com/media/6-25-2015/tCTpR5.gif) after you made me an nostalgic.. I couldn't not! 









 Well played. Well played indeed. 




 And now I have the BruuuutttGGG noise playing over and over and over in my head. And now it's Adam's smile afterwards.. and now I'm smiling. Thanks! :D 









 To be fair, cloud storage is quite cheap and/or microUSBUSB flash drives are pretty cheap these days. But I see what you mean. 









 Ok, so someone who regularly blows through stop signs goes through every stop sign, except this one because he's warned him.

He does the same thing tomorrow, expect this time he hits you with his car because he wasn't looking properly. 

But that's okay because he wasn't caught by the police and taught a lesson to not blow through stop signs??

Your logic is flawed.  









 So I don't make my title a contender for /r/titlegore I'll put the whole story here.

Dude who ran down family walking dog. 

Killed dog, made multiple attempts to run over the man as well.

Locked up in Hillmortons in Chch (ironically where his victim works..).

Declared medically sane, and fit to stand trial. 

Denying all charges.


I hope he goes away for a fucking long time. 









 SKY!!!!!! DO NOT TOUCH THE VODAFONE BOXES.

Sorry for the yelling, I have not heard **anything** good about the Vodafone boxes. Ever.
They both use different technology, one's provided via cable (Ex-TC) and the other via Satelite (Sky). 
The Sky boxes are infinitely more reliable from what I've heard than the TC/Vodafone boxes.   




 There's noone else in my country with it installed. - New Zealand. 




 YMMV but that was adequate to get a crisp shot last night on my D7000 last night. (Of nothing but light pollution sadly..)

If the aurora's quite dim then you may need longer,  but iirc 15+ seconds will get you star trails which may or may not be desirable, personal taste here :) 




 ah 18mm at ISO 200, for 3 seconds should be enough. You can also use multiple exposure options in your shooting menu to combine exposures. (may produce star trails.) 




 TeHokioi what's your camera model/lens?
 









 Unfortunately as someone who worked in an electronics shop for more time than I care to think about, 90% of repairs was some fucktard who dropped their phone in the toilet and thought it was covered by warranty. 

If in doubt I always checked the moisture detectors myself (typically under the battery - white pads turn pink) before sending it away. If it was pink I warned them it was guaranteed to come back water damaged and they'd lose their bond. Noone ever argued with me that they hadn't got it wet! 




 Can I add (having gone to the TDR myself) that they are an absolute last ditch effort, and can **only be raised once you've raised a complaint with your telecom company.** 




 Ironically this minor rant is actually playing right into their marketing.. 




 Blimey.

Bishopdale wasn't that bad, still needed a whole jug of warm water to get the door open though!  




 He really fucking does. Always support your theiving fucking mates before someone who employed you ay? 









 Fortunate, I was lucky enough to get away by 7.30 so little traffic, but very icy with little cars having warmed the road! So trade off really 









 A spider's venom is incredibly precious and hard to make for a spider, and it doesn't need to eat very often. 

So it's not going to waste this incredibly hard to make venom on just 1 thing that has to eat or it will go to waste, it would rather use it on 100 smaller things as it needs to eat. 




 I saw at least 5 cars run red lights, lost traction half a dozen times, and saw some incredibly stupid things on my way to work this morning. So just take it easy!

And of course, if you do get in a crash, pics or it didn't happen. :D 




 That's stupendous hypocrisy, Dunedin has a world renown culture of drinking, and it's more than reasonable to presume your reigning fat cats are  more than a tad guilty of milking this "fun" culture in their advertising campaign, while adding to it in their own youth. But hey, whatever keeps then in power eh. 




 I figured a whole lot of drunk people would cause the issue where they were ejected from, rather than travel to other areas to play up. However that's true, and the issue with staggered closing times 




 My 2c:

Advertising isn't fixing that culture, in fact given the freedom of our brewery giants with advertising it's a stark contrast, we have "no more Beersies" coupled with some pretty hard hitting alcohol advertising about partying etc. 

Ultimately you can't trust your customers to know when to stop, and pubs make money from selling you overpriced booze, so there's a conflict of interest there. 

I wish I knew how to address things, but seriously New Zealanders like their booze, and have a deeply engrained drinking culture that's going to take some doing to unwind the recent rise in statistics around drunken assaults, and strain on emergency services from drunken tomfoolery. 

I'm no idiot, there is always going a problem, and old people who make the law tend to have stupidly short memories as to what they did when they were young, and that hypocrisy is adding to the problem.  




 I'm surprised it's not the suburb which enacted the lock out that suffers though. But yes hopefully it doesn't serve as a precursor for what they wish to enforce here in Chch, I suspect it will be. 









 Yes, because HP new Zealand are also participating in the Step up challenge..  




 Honestly banner ads are far better than suggestive full screen advertising. Uninstalling to avoid having "find singles now" with an ass in my face (well screen) every few seconds.
