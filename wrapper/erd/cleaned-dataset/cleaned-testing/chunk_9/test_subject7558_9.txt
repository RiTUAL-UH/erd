 With your mouth. 




 Ask him for a bump. Best friends forever. 




 That might work once, they'll just tell you to quit taking anything that triggers a positive, unless it's prescribed by a doctor. 




 You should probably consult the food pyramid to ensure your meal is a bit more nourishing. 




 I know practically nothing about synthetic cannabinoids. I'm curious as to which ones are most popular. Also, there's brands out there such as "Good Times" and "Bayou Blaster", does anybody know which chemicals are likely to be in these two brands? Thanks in advance. 




 USER NAME CHECKS OUT, MOTHER FUCKER 




 Just shoot you a quarter gram of meth and blow a fireball up in his grill, you heard? 




 You're right. That had to be said. We all needed to hear that. Thanks for sharing. 




 Kratom Connoisseurs, I do believe. 




 No. 




 Oh. Well, still, I think starting the day with a toilet jerk will do you good. 




 "I still have a hard time in the mornings"

That's called morning wood, son. Hit the bathroom for a quick toilet jerk and you'll be right as rain. 




 1)no 2) they won't kill you, but you'll wish you were dead 3) IV, snort, oral, probably sublingual, rectal.... but IV is truly the only way to go, when it comes to morphine. Words simply can't do the feeling justice. You really might as well just get some heroin, though. A lot better bang for your buck and it's practically the same shit. Morphine pills are fuckin expensive.  




 I think he thought you meant you take Suboxone daily, not that you're on the kratom sub daily. 




 The bags HS uses actually keep light from affecting the kratom over time. They're superior to the clear bags from MS. 




 FUCK YOU ASSHOLE 




 I think he's just saying you could've worded it differently, is all. 




 Your friend is pretty gangster. 




 Jam it up your dick hole 




 This sounds lie my nightmare.

So how was it packaged? Was it just powder in a baggie/container with no label anywhere and no paperwork of any sort to be found? Or did they actually label it wrong and trick you into thinking you got what you ordered? 




 I've argued with people about the "less water you use, the stronger the shot" ideology. It just doesn't make any sense. A quarter g in 10 units of water is going to make you just as high as a quarter g in 100 units of water. The amount of water you use can't possibly make a shot stronger or weaker, less water doesn't equal more dope. The only explanation as to why it may seem like it makes it stronger to some people (not me) is because 10 units of water injects faster than 100 units of water, therefore the quarter g hits you harder, since it's hitting you in a much shorter time span.

 So this may be logical for some people who have trouble shooting, you know the ones.... after 7 minutes and 5 different holes in their body, they finally get the whole thing pushed in, split into thirds between injection sites lol. 

However, I believe it is a bad idea for those people to only use 10 units of water, because time is not on their side, their rigs start to clot up with blood and the less water they start out with, the faster their shit is fucked. 

It's actually funny, my friend (who's an anny cook) sat there and tried convincing me that less water means a stronger shot. You would think a cook would understand why it's not true. Although, this is the same guy that calls pseudoephedrine "pseudophetamine" and thinks that MSM has methamphetamine in it because the first "M" in MSM stands for "meth". 

He was actually the baddest anny cook around, though. Just goes to show you how simple the shit really is to make, any retard can do it. Lol. He just had the technique down is all. He couldn't actually tell you why the reactions happened the way they did, or what was happening, all he could tell you was that you were gonna dry heave when you jammed it in your arm... and he was right. 




 Hey man. No problem. Do you need an address to send my reward to or do you just wanna hit me off with some BTC real quick? Lol just kidding bub. Good luck in your manhunt for these scumbags. I bet they even got little Vienna sausage wieners. Did any of the missing packages contain ExtenZe?  




 Have you tried red vein Sumatran, red vein Thai or red vein Borneo? Maha Kali stimulated me too and Hulu kapuas didn't have much effect at all. The first three I just mentioned are the best downers IMO. 




 Well, they're gonna learn the truth quickly, I'm afraid. 




 Dirty socks will get a whole BTC from me. 




 Korean linen is best linen. 




 So what happened at court? Did you get them good or what? 




 Listen, they can ban kartom all they want. They just better leave our kratom alone. 




 Hmm. I have a feeling this guy is headed to Herbal Salvation. 




 I have no sort of heart condition but when I'm abusing stims I can almost feel the damage being done. Just don't go slamming quarter grams of crank man. Take it easy. 




 Well, that's how many 
they supposedly stole, anyway. Maybe they didn't want to tell them anything they stole that was a felony to possess. That's just pure imagination on my part though lol. It makes sense though that weed is the stuff they'd be stealing, since that's likely the only thing they could actually detect by sense of smell. 




 I remember Smokey's saying something about losing packages in Chicago. Is this the same place?

http://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/7/71/604084/postal-service-employees-charged-stealing-drugs-packages-ohare 




 Yes. That is correct. Also, we don't want no scrubs. 




 "Always good to take everything you read online, most especially Reddit, with a big grain of salt. "

Especially when you're reading reviews posted by a throwaway account. Ahem. 




 "4 hours of trial and error"

Hmmmm 




 wat 




 As other people said, kratom will help tremendously.

I've been through a lot of treatment programs, and they always tell you to never attempt to quit things like smoking or coffee or fatty foods in the beginning of your recovery. It makes sense. Everybody has a vice, you're concentrating on eliminating your benzo use which is far more important than any of your other problems right now. After you get a little sobriety under your belt, then may be a good time to look at your other addictions.

 




 He's a Skype stripper 




 I spill half a gram on the floor within five minutes of getting up, son. 




 He's got the fire and the fury  




 The Maha Kali did the same thing to me, even at a smaller dose. I just decided it wasn't for me. 




 Good one. 




 I thought this subreddit was in favor of using research chemicals as a way to improve our lives. Why everybody hatin, bro? 




 A chronic and debilitating urge to have hot sweaty wieners slapped against his face. 




 Lol positive. I've been checking up on it every day. He changes it every day. 




 No. Look at his site right now. He said it was open for orders until Monday, and now he says he's still shipping stuff tomorrow. He also said on his site everything shipped yesterday and the tracking numbers were sent out this morning. I just checked the temp.pm I sent him Saturday because it was about to expire, and he never saw it, so I resent another one. That's why I'm assuming his email isn't working for me. 




 Could you imagine the scores of fiends that would congregate in the parking lots of Wal Mart if you could buy dope there? Stealing stuff to return for gift cards is already a huge problem for them, imagine how bad that would get. They'd have to have security guards with guns all over the place, whippin junkies' asses and shit. It would be pretty awesome. 




 They're on the shady vendor list. Do not recommend. 




 honk 




 Thanks man. I may be retarded. 




 Thanks man. IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY STARTS REALIZING HOW GREAT I AM. 




 I had a batch of fuel left over after a meth cook which could have had no more than half a gram of meth in it total. They weighed the fuel as a whole and charged me for possessing 56 grams of meth or some shit like that. I got 4 years for it. 




 How is this the only post calling this guy out? 




 I actually got a boner 




 Damn man. That was a pretty unrelenting kratom review. 









 I've done some research, and I've come across several services, such as Shared Coin, BitcoinFog, and Darkwallet. But when I look at reviews of each, it seems they both have bad and good things about them, and I'm having trouble getting a definitive answer. What's the best/most popular way to go these days? 




 Do I need to use my PGP program to read this? 




 That's funny. K-pins wreck me the hardest, they were always my fave, with Xanax taking a distant second. Valium and Ativan never did anything to me though. Like literally, I wouldn't even feel handfulls of them. Funny how that works. I used to love benzos, they were my third DOC, but I find that I don't need them at all as long as I'm not doing uppers. They just make me tired and depressed now, as you were saying. 




 Benzos make you depressed? Or it makes you depressed to not be able to take benzos? 




 Oh yeah, absolutely, the engine has 130k on it. I'm not sure why I referred to it as new.  




 Fuck Kratom Korner. 




 Ok, I have a code reader for a laptop, I'll try and see if it'll show me a code. Sort of a pain in the ass to have to carry around a laptop in the car lol but I'll do that and see if I can catch it.  




 My old lady just had a new engine installed in her car. Ever since then, it stutters. It'll do it going up hills mostly, when trying to accelerate, but it does it here and there on flat land too. I did some research, saw some stuff about catalytic converter and whatnot, I've basically ruled everything other than the engine itself out because it didn't do this at all before the new engine. My best guess so far is the EGR valve? The check engine light comes on here and there, especially when it's happening, but it goes back off. Thanks in advance. 




 You're supposed to swallow the etiz before you actually take a bite of food. 




 Lol I was just fuckin with ya man.
