 Vitamin E oil in excess on the skin any time it will be / is stretching like pregnancy or bulking up in any way will reduce the appearance of stretch marks even before they start. My mom had 3 kids and no stretch marks and she swears by vitamin e oil (you can buy it in capsules from the drugstore). 

Helps with sunburns also because it moisturizes your skin like crazy!
