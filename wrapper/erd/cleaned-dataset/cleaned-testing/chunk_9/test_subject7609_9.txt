 I'm glad to see intelligent discourse on this sub 




 Reading isn't any different from TV, video games, etc. ...so no 




 Common sense would seem to say don't buy it then

  It'd be one thing if women in the publishing industry were legitimately discriminated against, meaning, if a man and woman with the same manuscript were to walk in, the man would get chosen.

-----

In this case, women make up less than 50% of the industry, yet if a man and woman walk in with the same credentials, the woman will be chosen.

Can you really not even see your own inconsistencies and biases? Your "information on the admissions standards of an industry" is just some random thing you claimed to read on reddit. I think we're done here.
 




 yay an ad 




 Still waiting on what kind of statistics you'd need to admit there is a discrimination problem. Is there any statistic you'd consider good enough?

By the way, your STEM example is incredibly hypocritical, considering you're badgering me to give proof for my discrimination claims. 




 What kind of data are you looking for exactly that will satisfy your claim? Doesn't seem like a huge leap to me. 




 There are links with statistics in the article, if you bothered to read it. I don't support this agenda and feel like this is the wrong way to address existing issues, but to claim there is no bias at all in the publishing industry and everyone is judged equally? Naive at best... 




 you're banned from the internet 




  My point is if your a good writer with a good story no one cares what gender you are.

Your point is incorrect 





























 I enjoyed it. It's a fun book 




 Grit lit is probably my favorite genre.  




 I didn't like it, but you may - *Life After Life* by Kate Atkinson 




 I don't think you understand what racism is 




 Attempts to rectify systemic injustices are not examples of racism themselves. 




 Good for you? Does not giving a fuck about social commentary include making sure everybody knows that and handwaving off people that do care? 




 pretty sure racial issues aren't an American only thing 




 As a reader of SF/F, I'd hope you'd know that it's a wellspring for bringing social commentary to the reader under the guise of something more approachable, not just robots and dragons. Race is a  huge part of a multitude of novels in the genre. 




 I love that this sub would rather discuss things like who dog ears pages in their books before allowing one topic on race to reach the front page of the sub 









 The article shows poll results... 




 The entire point is that reading is not a gendered activity 









  That still doesn't explain why it's supposedly so encumbant on fathers

Because you're a parent and it's your job to do the best you can raising your children? Taking care of one aspect of parenting doesn't get you off the hook for others, that isn't quite how parenting works. 




 I think the reason is because kids are sponges, and what you do as a parent they will see and mimic. Especially important if you are raising boys and never read to them - what does that teach them?

I agree with the article, the more kids see you reading the better off they will be. Plus, it's fun reading to your kids! 
























 There are definitely gender biases and imbalances in the industry that need to be addressed. However, this is really not the way to address those issues. This isn't magical fairy land, the author must know there is no chance of what she suggests gaining any kind of traction. *Winds of Winter* is finally done? Sorry George, no men this year! 

All this does is give opponents of the issue an easy target, angers an entire gender where a good amount are on your side, and doesn't help further progress on the actual issue at all. Boo this woman! 




 Pretty sure not a single person on Earth has even come close to making that comparison 




 Answers to 1,1,1,and 2: the library 




 I think personally I'd opt for reading the book 




 Feast of Snakes or The Gospel Singer are both great. Still going through his catalog myself. Car is one of my favorites 




 Or if you're into short stories,  *The Third Bear*. 




 Harry Crews 




 That's James Gunn 




 He specifically asked if the list is too "chick friendly" - it's even in the title. Pick another windmill pal 




 I finished the book, but hated *On the Beach* by Nevil Shute. Boring as anything, and some of the worst written, unbelievable characters I've read anywhere, particularly the women in the book. 




 Definitely, great book. Her writing is fairly unique I think, but the Goldfinch is like a modern day Great Expectations. 




 I wonder if someone will mention Catcher in the Rye 




 Reading challenges are good for getting into the habit of reading. Someone who reads 10 books a year will find it surprising how easy and enjoyable it is to read 52 if they simply set aside the time.

Once you're back into the habit of reading however, they are pretty much a dick measuring contest. 









 I've read a handful of books published in 2014, and I think the book of the year is Smith Henderson's *Fourth of July Creek* 




 Maybe next time he should just rape somebody, this sub would be much more accommodating to him 




 I'm confused as to where you think this happens? Please point me to a list that has "token recommendations" that spoil the quality of the list for diversity's sake? 




 Haven't heard of him, but I'm a big fan of southern gothic. Any comparable authors? 




 In the 1980s, Italo Calvino said in his essay "Why Read the Classics?" that "a classic is a book that has never finished saying what it has to say" and comes to the crux of personal choice in this matter when he says (italics in the original translation): "*Your* classic author is the one you cannot feel indifferent to, who helps you define yourself in relation to him, even in dispute with him." 







































 Maybe next time you shouldn't make an ignorant comment without expecting to be called out on it then 




 Life is not nearly as simple as you make it out to be. There are a multitude of woman's issues today even in the most civilized countries. Maternity leave policies are bad or nonexistent. Birth control policies are still backwards and woman are losing legislative ground. Violence against woman is a huge problem almost everywhere, and we can make strides to protect women better. Many portrayals of woman in the media are still harmful. The disproportionate amount of woman in STEM fields... this is just barely touching on the hotbed issues.

"Women can do all the same stuff men can" is a very narrow way of looking at things. 




 Feminism isn't about giving woman "more rights". Feminism is about making sure woman are being treated fairly - be it economically, culturally, or politically. To be "against" something as basic as supporting someone else's human rights and fair treatment is simply appalling. 




 you disagree with equal rights for women and men? 




 can't roll my eyes hard enough... 




 *A Feast of Snakes* by Harry Crews 




 Hurrrrr 




 The book was interesting but the end showed the author really had no clue what to do with the supernatural elements she set up. 

Book was still alright, not bad for a first novel. Could have been a lot better 




 I just finished Fourth of July Creek yesterday, great book! One of the best I read this year. Other contenders:

* *Car* and *Childhood: a Biography of a Place* by Harry Crews

* *Less than Zero* and *American Psycho* by Brett Easton Ellis

* *A Confederacy of Dunces* by John Kennedy Toole

* *Hill William* by Scott Mcclanahan  




 Wait a minute, people compensating for lack of real life power by abusing what laughably unimportant power they do have in the virtual world?  Say it ain't so 




 My bookshelf has zero organization and a lot of books

 What makes your book stand out in the massive influx of epic fantasy we are seeing now due to the popularity of *A Song of Ice and Fire*? 














 Sounds like you won't like it 




 They are by no means offensively bad, but I agree that Annihilation is the best in the trilogy. If you're curious I'd say pick them up.  














 *Car*, by Harry Crews. It's about a man who attempts to eat an entire car on stage. It's god damn awesome 




 I mean, it's fairly obvious that he will explain the terms to you if you read more than two pages. ..I think Paul even questions what the kwisatz hiderach and a gom jabbar are in his internal monolog. ... 




 as i play bowling 




 **The Third Bear** by Jeff Vandermeer and **North American Lake Monsters** by Nathan Ballingrud are both fantastic collections of weird/horror/fantasy short stories. Vandermeer is most well known for the Southern Reach trilogy but I feel like this book is actually his best work.

**Eyes of the Dragon** by Stephen King is also very good - if you really want to be picky, it has loose connections to the Dark Tower, but is very much a stand alone book. Much closer to traditional fantasy than the short story collections as well. 




 Don't let the Fifty Shades reference in the title scare you, Angela Carter is the real deal. 









 That's the consequences of raping someone. .. 









 Verbal threats/harrassment are not the same as someone disagreeing with you. They are very much capable of being life ruining. Something can still be bad, even if there are worse situations in the world - it's not a contest. 




 yes, refn is ripping off hotline miami, not the other way around 
























 Lol. I have 50k in my bank account, but I'm unable to make a 7 dollar purchase in the Internet. Right. .. 




 domestic abuse is always good for a laugh! 









 This site is pretty bad and buggy.

- Very slow. Lots of bugs and mislabeled entries for books.

- Lacking many obscure and non mainstream books. The site doesn't even have an entry for *The Goldfinch* (or if it does, it's totally buried), which won a Pulitzer in 2014...come on.

- Seems to recommend the same books to everyone - Hope you like *Maus* and *The Far Side*, this site sure does!

I don't understand why I see this linked all of the time in this sub, Goodreads is miles better.

 The Wallcreeper is one of the few novels I just hated reading the whole way through 




 I had a claim in for a 4th Rd rookie receiver off FA, but in the process put in bids for about 4 other wrs I was planning on withdrawing in the morning before the spin to mask the one guy I wanted. Wasnt able to log in to get rid of the extra claims, so now I picked up 5 junk wrs while dropping rookie talent including my second round this year and future center. Not happy. Am I screwed here?  




 Same here looks down 




 People love to bring up Lovecraft whenever a bigoted author is mentioned,  but they are just not the same. Lovecraft was raised during the nadir of American race relations,  the worst era of racism after the civil war.  His racism should not be ignored, but it should be judged according to the times in which he wrote his books.

Card actively campaigns against gay rights and has no excuse for his warped, hateful views in today's society.  




 I highly doubt most people are censoring themselves - more a case of thinking "Wow, that guy is a huge dick", and by extension losing interest in the book.

I know personally this is the case for me. If someone like Card wrote something I wanted to read, I'd still read it, just find a way to do so where I'm not monetarily supporting the author... 




 I do too. Good thing there's a multitude of both written by people that aren't bigots.  




 Lol

Guys why didn't I enjoy this book written for thirteen year olds 




 Hp lovecraft isn't comparable to card. Lovecraft's racism is awful, but also a testament to the times it was written. Card has no such excuse, and is not only a homophobe, but one actively involved in bringing his stance to the public.  




 I think not supporting a vile homophobe is a fine and respectable reason, even if you don't particularly agree. I read Ender's Game personally but totally understand OP'S views 




 An interesting interpretation of the book - [here](https://italkyoubored.wordpress.com/2011/10/20/american-psycho-maybe-not-the-book-you-think-it-is/). Not sure I agree 100%, but I think it goes to show that the book is more than just shock value. 




 The book is smart and funny. It mixes social satire, black comedy, and slasher horror films effortlessly. It's deeply layered and has commentary ranging from the obvious in capitalist corporate culture, to the more subtle in things like the AIDS scare in the eighties. I think it's one of the best books written in the past 30 years. 




 It's not exaggerating at all. Sorry you're too closed minded to consider that something containing gore might actually have literary value as well. But please, keep telling me how pretentious I am while you compare what I like with Kentucky Fried Chicken 




 Or a modern day masterpiece, however you want to look at it 









 What modern day directors are pushing the limits of cinema? Nicholas Refn? Gaspar Noe? I would love to hear your thoughts. 




 That's a silly metric for picking books 




 *A Visit From the Goon Squad* by Jennifer Egan. Wasn't perfect, but the book had a lot about it that I really liked.
