 It was on my first try. I closed the app and reopended it, was able to skip the intro. 




 Yeah. 70,000 koins for 3 gear cards? Fuck that rip off, I'll just collect the rewards at the end of a season. And no option to buy Revenant Sub-Zero or Revenant Jax without buying the 850 souls pack? There's a decent amount of kontent in this update to be sure (althought the challenges they speak of aren't here) but wow, making everything so expensive is a real good way to... ah whatever. Everything's been mega expensive in this game since launch anyway so whatever.

Anyone else notice they didn't mention the fact that the gold kombat pack is now more expensive as well? It's back up to the original 150 souls. Gotta squeeze that money out of us somehow I guess. 














 I suppose, lol. It just blows my mind when I hear some music on the radio and I say "Wow, this person/group has a record deal. I mean, someone paid them real money to make this and release it." 









 I've never suffered trauma and I don't have PTSD or high anxiety or anything like that. Therefore I have no opinion on the matter. 




 I never said all modern music is shit, just MOST of the shit in the charts. Boring repetitive lyrics and uninspired melodies rule the day. There's plenty of modern music I like, but most of the popular stuff really doesn't appeal to me. 




 Didn't CJ betray OG Loc though? Helped him get Madd Dogg's rhyme book but later chased him down and extorted a shit tonne of money out of him for releasing a song using Madd Dogg's rhymes?

You better check yourself before you wreck re-wreck yourself. 




 The first part is wrong, the second part is pretty much right, minus the stupid part. I wouldn't call someone stupid for their preferences, but if I think they enjoy shit then I'm gonna say it.

But then again, at the risk of sounding like a massive douche hipster, I find lot of mainstream stuff to be shit, music especially. [Am I so out of touch?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAuR5bkIlQ)
 




 Shhhh! Spoilers!

Seriously though, regardless of what Smoke did, every time I see him in cut scenes it's like seeing an old buddy of mine, since I've spent way more time in his company early in the game than I have near the end of the game when, well, you know. 




 1. Maybe you don't want to spend all day running across the desert and a vehicle is too noisy.

2. Maybe you don't want to use the somewhat OP buddies.

3. Maybe you want to experience all the game has to offer.

4. Maybe you want to see if the hilariously unrealistic looking horse shit has been made to look less cartoony since we saw it last year. 




 Good isn't subjective though. Quality of a product is objective. Too few people realise that something you like and something that's good aren't always the same thing.

Example time.

I don't like Coldplay's music, but I recognise that they are in fact a good band.

I like one or two of Dizzy Rascal's songs, but I don't think his music is technically good.

See?

if a few million people think it's good, that probably makes it good

Nope, that's the appeal to popularity fallacy. The amount of people who like something has no bearing on the actual quality of the product in question. Millions of people (myself included) love McDonald's food, that doesn't mean the food is good, far from it, the food is bad, but we still like it.

Conversely, millions of people HATE iPhones, that doesn't mean iPhones are bad, on the contrary, iPhones are pretty fucking good compared to most phones on the market.

So you see, quality isn't subjective, but how people feel about a product is.  




 I would have done it myself lol. 




 Yeah. People en masse love to eat up shit in large quantities. Look at crap like X Factor and The Apprentice. The number of people who like something has no bearing on the quality of said product. If you think the only factor of success is quality of the product then you're mistaken. The right marketing can sell shit just fine.

I think I've gone too far now. I don't think Kanye's music is all shit, that would be unfair to say. I can definitely say his music isn't for me, and I can definitely say that I prefer most of my music to his, but then I'm slightly biased so that doesn't mean much.

But I can say with certainty that I believe his music (and his shitty attitude) don't justify his success. 




 Straight busta. And get yo' self a haircut. Embarrassing to be seen witch you. 




 I know they can notice, but they never seem to in the videos I've seen. The whole thing just looks absurd to me. I know MGS has always had zany moments but they were usually few and far between. This game seems to flip flop between being realistic and a cartoon every 5 minutes.

Don't even get me started on that fucking flying fist bullshit. No amount of saying "nanomachines" is going to get me to accept the absurdity of that.

Looks fun though. 




  I mean seriously how hard of a question could I have asked at 7 or 8. I don't even remember the questions I asked

I think the point is you asked questions at all. That's the trouble with religion, it all too often discourages questioning because when you start to question religion the whole thing hilariously falls apart. 









 Lol. You think the quality of someone's music has much to do with getting platinum. Most labels don't give a shit if the music is good, they care if the musician is marketable. The two are not entirely related.  




 I don't mean right behind the train. I could have been more clear. What most people do (myself included in the past) was ride beside the person we wanted smoke to shoot. What should be done is ride behind the enemy so they're on screen but close enough to shoot. Always worked for me.  




 Oh, that's what that annoying sound was? 




 I'm sure it is the user spurring the horse. But if you want to get somewhere quickly you'll be spurring like mad, as they guy in the video did.  




 Thanks to social media and apathy it's a losing battle. I keep going in and out of trying to correct people, but in the end usage is the arbiter final when it comes to language. If enough people are wrong enough for long enough they eventually become right. Just look at how the word literally is used by the youth these days.  I'm sure Shakespeare would tell me I'm doing English wrong, lol.  




 I've made some music on my phone that I believe to be better than some of the shit I've heard from Kanye. Admittedly I didn't talk over my music so I guess he got me beaten lyrically, even if loads of his lyrics are just shite. 

He's a rap star. You speak as though rock stars don't exist any more. 




 Ah I see. No I didn't see it. I stopped acting destiny the minute I realised it was not so much a game, but a money making platform.  




 No. If you unexpectedly find yourself out of the house you just put the watch into power reserve mode.  




 And now that's the way I'll do it if I ever play it again.  




 I find it jarring and it pulls me out of it. At least it did in peace walker.  




 Yeah I know it's a real thing. But it's presented weirdly here. The way they hover then zip up quickly, the way no-one seems to notice it. It just pulls me out of the relative reality of the game. 

Edit: Again, downvoted for voicing my opinion in a polite manner and not insulting anyone in any way. Well done reddit. 




 I just make sure I'm far enough behind the enemy I want him to shoot so the enemy is on screen and I've not had any trouble with this method.  




 So just because a smart watch uses electricity or cannot be considered good engineering or art? Is argue the apple watch is much more appealing to the eye than many dumb watches of the same price I've seen.

I get that some purple like old ways of doing things. But I'm not one of them, if there's a more modern (and usually better) way of doing something (like tell the time) I'm all up for it.  




 I got a stand from a third party. The cable discreetly fits into the stand and the actual charging disc is presented in such a way that I can just place my watch onto it and it'll charge while remaining the right way up. Imagine the way watches are displayed in shop windows, it looks like that when charging. The charge easily lasts a day, even with heavy use, I'd still charge every night though as it'll run out half way through the following day of you don't. Or just have another charger at work, but it's better to charge at night so you can actually use it during the day.  




 I'm glad I'm not alone with my line of thinking. Imagine riding a horse for 5 minutes in that game.

*mute* 




 I can make a beat on my phone, doesn't make me a rock god.  




 Yeah, I'm sure he's deliberately pretending to be an arrogant annoying cunt most people can't stand.  




 He's a rapper. He talks over a beat for a living. And he thinks he's gods gift to music.  




 Don't take the words of a delusional man too seriously.  




 Because he's an arsehole.  




 But hardly any of them do it as loudly and with as much self assurance as he does. Most do it for show, rap is 90% appearance anyway. Kanye genuinely believes he's god's gift to music, and thinks everyone needs to know.  




 Kanye is a big headed prick that needs a serious reality check. That's why people hate him.

He literally thinks he's god's gift to music, if not humanity. His music is largely shitty. His attitude is shitty. He is a shitty.  




 That's good then. I guess it's good that they're showing us all the different things you an do in the that you may not even think about if you were just playing it.  




 At least in red dead there was a variety of sounds john made while on a horse. It wasn't just the same "Hyah!" Every 2 seconds. I got sick of it in this video, if it stays like that in the finished game I'll probably avoid horses.  




 That's good to know, thanks.  




 That's all good then.  




 The Fulton system seems out of place to me. I know it's been in since peace walker but still, it just seems too comical given the circumstances it's usually used in. I find it a little jarring, which is a shame because it looks like it's used a lot in this game.  




 Seems awful that when you're riding a horse you have to listen to the same "Hyah!" Sound bite over and over and over again. I hope they fix that before release.  




 I've been avoiding all these 30 minute gameplay demos because I don't want the entire game to be spoiled for me. But I'm gonna cave and watch this one. Surely most of the game has been shown in demos at this point? So many trailers it seems.  




 Am I the only one who thought the Iron Giant was a so-so film? Everyone seems to hail it as some timeless classic. What did I miss? 




 I've only played with him for about an hour so far but yeah, if you win a match and you're far enough away from the opponent as to avoid the walking away while scanning the blade animation he seems to imitate his opponent's laugh. I've only heard him laugh though. 




 I'm not telling you what to do. I'm not telling Citadel_CRA what to do either. I'm just letting him know I disapprove of people trying to make funner a word. Which I'm allowed to do. If you disagree, that's cool, I won't hold it against you or anything.

It's all opinions man, isn't that what reddit comments are all about? 









 I used to have trouble too. Once I realised he can only his enemies when they're on screen the mission became infinitely easier. 




 Downvoted for using "funner" like it's a word. 




 I used to feel the same until I realised I was the one in the wrong. I used to pull up along side the train because that would make sense. The trick is he can only hit enemies that are on the screen. Once you know this fact the mission becomes insanely easy. I always have the Vagos killed before the train enters the tunnel these days.

Edit: Downvoted for letting people know how to do the famously hard mission easily? What the fuck? 




 Wow. It's like playing the PS3 version again. 




 Wat? 




 Well, if the only reason you buy a watch is so you can sell it later for a good price then I guess you won't want a smart watch. I don't have a watch because it will hold it's value, I have a watch because it does cool things. 




 You only need to buy a smart watch every few years if you want to keep using all the nifty extra features that a smart watch can do (which you'll obviously want to do, but is by no means necessary).

If you don't buy a new watch after 3 or 4 years and it stops being able to do the fancy stuff you're still left with a nice looking watch that tells the time, same as if you bought a dumb watch, only you got 3-4 years of smartness out of it. 




 I woulnd't pay the money for one, mine was a 30th birthday present. It's just cool. I love the way the screen is blank until you raise your arm to check the time, then it lights up. Also being able to create and send text messages/hold phone conversations using your watch is futuristic as fuck. Joe 90/Jetsons futuristic.

Plus I've still not seen anyone else wearing one, so I guess the exclusivity is nice, if you're into that sort of thing.

The watch is also basically a remote for your phone. If there's any video or audio playing you can play, pause, or skip tacks using the watch.

When I'm walking down the shops I can put my headphones in and just say to my watch "Hey Siri, play Muse" and it'll do just that. Or just saying "Play random music" is pretty cool too.

If I'm playing games and I get a text I might miss it because I use a gaming headset, but with the watch I don't miss texts because I get a subtle tap on the wrist telling me I have a notification. I can then glance at my watch and read the message without having to pick up my phone, unlock it, then read.

If you're in a quiet place the voice recodnition software is flawless, easily the best I've ever used. Outside in the city, well, you might as well text on your phone.

Overall I wouldn't say they're quite worth the asking price, yet. More apps are being developed daily, but like I said, mine was a birthday present and I love it. One word to describe the Apple Watch, cool. 




 This is the first time I've seen one in the wild since I saw that video telling me that such a thing existed. Upvoted for use of interrobang.

Side note: Chrome doesn't recognise the word interrobang, lol. 




 I just take my watch off every night anyway, so nightly charging isn't an issue for me at all. 




  You need to re-buy smart watches every few years

Source? 




 I hate it when I check the time and someone says "I'm sorry, are we keeping you?"

I'm like: Uh, no. I just wanted to see what the fucking time was you tedious prick. 




 Do you take your watch off at night when you go to bed? That's when you charge it. 




  garmin vivofit

Those are some nifty features. Shame it's ugly as hell. 




 Then they won't be buying one, just as they won't be buying a $350 dumb watch. 




 Do you take your watch off when you go to bed at night? I did with my dumb watch, as I now do with my smart watch. The only difference being that now, the stand I put my watch on charges the watch while I sleep. This whole having to charge your watch complaint is entirely redundant unless you NEVER take your watch off. 




 No-one needs an expensive anything, but some people want them. 




  What's gonna happen when my watch doesn't get updated for gmail, gps, and any other useful function?

Then you got 2 good years of fancy watch uses, now you can go back to your phone and you're still left with a cool watch that tells the time. You could probably still make calls and send texts using it too. 




  They look at things like the history, the craftsmanship, the details of the finish, the innovations, the complications, and of course, the brand itself.

Can all these things not be appreciated with smart watches? Ok, maybe the history can't, yet, but I couldn't care less about the history of the company that made my watch, that doesn't affect my usage of said watch. 




 I don't get it. People seem fine with paying $400+ for a watch that does nothing but tell the time, yet turn their noses up at a $400+ watch that tells the time, contains a calendar, can tell you the weather, can play games, can access social media, is basically a remote control for any audio/video playing on your phone, is supported with OS updates, manage emails, has maps and can direct you to a destination via subtle taps on the wrist signalling when to turn left or right, can access photos on your phone, can show you the stock exchange, and CAN MAKE CALLS AND TEXTS LIKE THE FUCKING JETSONS!

It also looks cool as hell IMO. 




 Or, you could buy a smart watch, use all the fancy features a dumb watch doesn't have for at least a couple of years, then if your watch is outdated by a new OS (unlikely since you can update a watches OS too) then you're still left with a watch that tells the time, just as you would a dumb watch.

As for a "horrible" battery life. I always took my old watch off every night and put it on my bed side table, I do the same with my smart watch, only now it rests on a charging stand. The battery life is not an issue. 




  It makes no sense

Welcome to the world of religion! 




 I'm surprised some people never noticed the giant ship that makes noises when he does a brutality. I love the way he laughs as he walk away, so badass. 




 I really wish they'd given him some lines at the beginning of fights. I'm really disappointed that the DLC characters all have only one costume each, and their dialogue is seriously lacking. I know Jason can't talk so he gets a pass. Tanya's dialogue usually boils down to:

Tanya: [Enemy's name.]
Enemy: Tanya!
Tanya: [a line that just someone's name] 




 This is just ramping off a mound of sand/rocks. If you watch the video you'll be able to see where it is. It's near the prison.

http://youtu.be/gfsKirun0ss 




 I'm capable of understanding that people like it. I'm just saying that I don't.  




 Totally worth it if you like MGS.  









 Yes, they're the special editions you mentioned. MGS3 even has Metal Gear 1 and 2 included, so it's really 5 games in one! 




 Ah, now you've given me that sage advice my mind is at rest.  




 It's near the satellite dishes in Sandy Shores. Me and some friends had fun trying to land our cars in the dishes.  




 That's different. French Fries may not be French, but their name is indeed French fries.

A barrel roll is not an aileron roll. To say it is is to be wrong.  




 Then you'll be wrong every time you call something that's not a barrel roll a barrel roll.  




 And I agree. 




 WAAAAAA!!!!! 




 I don't want to buy a shitty hand held system just to play one game though. And as I've mentioned in many other comments I did get the HD collection, and was thoroughly disappointed with how crap Peace Walker was.  




 I can over it, for the most part. It doesn't bug me too much when playing Ground Zeroes, but I'll never forget/forgive kojima for fucking up so royally.  




 Me too, until they released the HD bundle on PS3 a year later that included MGS2, MGS3, and MGS Peace Walker, all in HD.  




 Nearly interchangeable, but not quite. If one pilot said to another "Do a barrel roll", but he did an aileron roll, there could be dire consequences. 




 It's not a bad style per se, but when you compare it to the cutscenes from any previous MGS game they're an embarrassment. I didn't know a storyboard was going to tell the story before I bought the game. When they started I was like "I really fucking hope this is just the intro and the whole game's story isn't told this way."

And so I was disappointed from the get go.  




 Yeah, it's all my opinion. I'm not tying to say that these things are objectively better in previous games, just how I feel about them.

And you mentioning technical limitations takes us back to my initial point. If the game has to be crippled mechanically because it's being released on a hand held then maybe just make it a console game and fully realise the glorious vision, and save the hand held for some non canonical game like MGS Acid.  




 But the border detailed in the diagram kind of sort of almost looks like a barrel shape, nearly.  




 Keifer did do a good job, even though in Ground Zeros he constantly sounds like he's in a recording booth, sound design dropped the ball on that one IMO. Sounds like he's in a small box every time he speaks. 

My point is they could have replaced Hayter with anyone and it would have been worse, because Hayter's voice is Snake's. It's like if Dan Castellaneta was dropped from the Simpsons cast and was replaced by someone who did a voice that sounded nothing like Homer's. Change an iconic voice and I lose all connection to the character that had been built up over the years. 




 MGS1 is the only one where I felt the character moved sluggishly. After playing the first 3 Resident Evils and the first 3 Tomb Raiders the movement in MGS2 and 3 was anything but tank like. I never felt like the characters were uncooperative in their movements in MGS2 and 3.  




 I know making a MGS game on a hand held was inevitable, they already did it with Acid. My gripe comes from the fact that it was canon. I felt like I was missing out on the latest chapter in my favourite game story, because that's what WAS happening.

Sure they released it later on consoles but it was still a shitty mobile game, one that I didn't bother finishing because it was such a step back from the previous games. They could have made Acid 2 and 3 for all I care, I wouldn't have been missing out on a brand new fully featured sequel to (at the time) my second favourite game.  




 Yeah I bought that, I got to play Peace Walker... eventually. Was disappointed greatly by it.  




 Here's a list of things PW did worse than previous games, in my opinion.

Graphics

Cutscenes

Story

Characters

Shooting Mechanics (ok, they were better than in MGS 2, I'll admit that)

Incredibly tedious base building

Story separated into individual missions like an arcade game

Lack of any cinematic feel

Weird boss fights set in obviously-only-existing-to-support-a-boss-fight arenas

I'm sure there's more, but it's been 3 years since I played PW and I don't remember it all that well. I don't think there's any aspect of PW that improved over previous entries.  




 What would you call the move if done in, say, a car? It's still not a barrel roll.  














 True. But I think this is one of those instances of "When enough people are wrong enough for long enough, they become right." That seems to be how language evolves.

Like when most people say laminating they actually referring to encapsualting. 




 What was an accident? 




 This STILL happens? Wow. 




 I still think it's dumb to cut out a huge portion of your fanbase (i.e. everyone who didn't own a PSP) of the franchise. I wouldn't care if it weren't canon like MG Acid. But to make a canonically accurate direct sequel only available to a tiny portion of the people who love the series, and also make it easily worse than the two previous installments just bugged me for years. 




 True. But then again I don't even really consider this to be the Snake I know and love since they dropped David Hayter. Dave IS Snake. 




  keep in mind that it's meant to be a psp game so there are a lot of stuff that might seem shitty compared to older games like mgs2 or 3

This really bugged me.

Konami: Let's make a direct sequel to the best MGS game to date. And let's make it canon! And let's gimp it by making it a handheld title so it's worse than the previous 2 games in every respect.

Second biggest disappointment in gaming for me. 




 I got Peace Walker with the HD collection on PS3 and was hugely disappointed, worst MGS game I've played.

The way the story was presented was a joke. No actual cutscenes (something the series is famous for) and instead they gave us shitty scratchy line scribbles, thanks Kojima. That totally ruined the whole experience for me. Then the gameplay was pretty shitty too. Coming off the back of the amazing MGS3 I was so happy to finally, after years of thinking I'd never get to play it, play PW. And wow was it a step backwards. You can say "But it was a PSP game so you can't expect much." or something like that, and to that I say they shouldn't have made a PSP MGS then, if it's going to literally be a step back in the series in every respect.

Did not finish, read the story on the wiki, probably won't go back to it, bad MGS game IMO. 




 I missed him the second I started playing Ground Zeroes.

Snake is dead, this is as bad as when they changed the actor who played John Connor from T2 to T3. Can't connect with the character, or rather I should say the connection has been severed. 




 Wasn't he trying to escape the "honour" of the title Big Boss because of his mission in MGS3? I figured he went back to being called Snake because it was his "name" before he **[MGS3 SPOILERS]** killed The Boss. 




  It seems like a lot of the ideas they're expanding in MGSV were ones that started off in peace walker.

Probably because MGSV is a sequel to MGS Peace Walker. 









 Got any links to share? 




 I know very little of the situation. For obvious reasons they're not discussing the details of the firing.

From what I can piece together from the backs of packets of mustard it seems people are more upset about the way the firing was handled (or not handled), rather than the firing itself. They have no notice to other mods or something. I think this is just the latest in a long list of reasons people have to hate Ellen, someone is not heard of until the previous debacle happened.

Luckily I'm currently down the Winchester having a nice pint waiting for this to all blow over.   




 Glad I could help.  




 I know you don't want to, but trust me, it's for your own good.  




 I don't read the comics, so I thought you were on about the actual blood code lmao.  




 I never said you couldn't ask for him in this game. You said you wanted some Spawn action, I told you where you can find it. I wasn't diminishing your request or coming at you with any attitude. Chill out and perhaps don't read attitude into comments that contain none, you'll be happier that way.  




 Noob Saibot is all I want.

But if I have to choose, I'd say:

Noob Saibot.
 




 Go play the Xbox version of Soul Calibur 2, he's in that. 




 Those are great ideas, sincerely. 




 I used Spawn in Soul Calibur 2. He was the most boring of the 3 guest fighters by far. 




 Tanya though. 




 A, B, A, C, A, B, B. 









 I started out using Unbreakable because of the sweet ice mask. But as soon as I realised Grand Master  was simple a better version of Unbreakable I made the switch and never looked back.

I do miss the ice mask over the dumb medallion, but the message is clear, there's no reason to ever choose Unbreakable Sub-Zero in MKX. 




 This sub is the worst I'm subscribed to for random downvotes. If it ain't a sexy cosplay or some new crazy combo you can be sure people will be out in force with their downvotes. 




 I hate the way Sub-Zero seems terrible for combos compared to pretty much every other character in the game. I laugh when people call me a spammer for using a the klone a few times (a lot).

They're all like: "Spamming scrub!"

And I'm all like: "I'm using the tools provided to Sub-Zero, sorry I can't 40% meterless mid screen like [insert most other characters] can." 




 Hmm, perhaps. 




 Whenever I see characters busting out mega long combos I cry a little that Sub-Zero has fuck-all combos that go past 32%.

I mean, 46% METERLESS? OP much? 




 We'll see. 









 Didn't this come out starring Jim Carrey, and wasn't it really shit? 




 Enter Konami.  




 It's actually staggering how little I are about all this. The sooner normal service is resumed the sooner I can actually enjoy visiting reddit again.   




 Does anyone even know what Victoria did to get fired?

Downvoted for asking a question. Gotcha.  




 So it's a case of: "We don't like the way this organisation we're volunteering our time to is treating us. So instead of, I don't know, us leaving this site because we're dissatisfied with the way it's managed,  we're going to make it as unusable as possible and hope the site goes under. And fuck anyone who just wants to use it as is."

Gotcha. 




 How am I contributing to you supposedly losing the right to free speech? Surely making subreddits private and removing places where people can speak is harming that right more than me not giving a fuck about some woman being fired.  




 Wait until NRS gives you the skin. They can't not do it now the other ninja all have their klassic skins. 














 They really do. The amount of detail is much improved, there's way more foliage and the grass isn't just a flat blurry texture anymore. Most notable though is on the PS4 version the city doesn't struggle to load when you're going mega fast, on the PS3 version that was common place. And the frame rate is usually a steady 30fps on the PS4 version, the PS3 struggled to reach even 30.

Long story short the PS3 was barely powerful enough to run GTAV, and that was with low detail compared to the PS4 version.  




 Something on the Mega Drive I'd imagine. The first one I can remember though it Tony Hawk's Skateboarding on the PS1. Trying to beat a top score on one of the levels. Wow, that was the first time I think I experienced genuine rage at a game.

Like real, actual rage. 




 Layman's Terms/TL;DR version of the ramifications please. 




 I keep hearing how good the DLC for New Vegas was, never got any of it though. I did get all the DLC for FO3 and enjoyed most of that. 




 Yeah, looks that way. If it is a direct sequel to 3 it stands to reason that water has been purified, allowing communities to thrive more easily, and therefore be more populated and perhaps more technologically advanced. 




 I think the 3 copies of Fallout 3 I currently own will suffice, thanks. 




 Not a lot I could do about that. I saved the pictures from the socialclub website, and this was as big as they came. 




 I'll have to take your word for it, lol. 




 Click to enlarge. 




 Sometimes it seems like they don't really care if the game works properly, given the amount of shit that's gone wrong since launch. 




 Thanks. I should do some more on PS4 version sometime. These photos were taken over a year ago. 









 These are the teams I rotate through on faction wars:

Bronze:

Lin Quei, Shirai Ryu, Monk

Silver:

Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Farmer Jax

Kano, D'Vorah, Reptile

Jax Briggs, Sonya Blade, Kenshi (sorry)

Klassic Kitana, Ermac, (waiting for another silver to join them)

Gold:

Ninjutsu Scorpion, Shaolin Kung Jin, Inferno Scorpion

Stunt Double Johnny Cage, Possessed Kenshi, Sun God Kotal Kahn (sorry)

Warlock Quan Chi, Assassin Kitana, Raiden

Venomous D'Vorah, Injustice Scorpion, Bojutsu Kung Jin

Demolition Sonya Blade, (need Cassie or A-List Johhny), Balanced Kenshi (sorry)

I also just got Grand Master Sub-Zero and I plan to team him up with Hat Trick Kung Lao and Cryomancer Sub-Zero when I eventually get those.

All the gold cards were attained from gold kombat packs. 




 I really need a load of koins. When was the most recent koin challenge? 




 I maxed out the x-rays on my first gold team (Ninjutsu Scorpion, Shaolin Kung Jin, Inferno Scorpion) but never them because of all the power drain specials out there. So now I just upgrade character's first and second specials and leave it at that, since they're mega powerful anyway.

Is there any good reason to blow money on upgrading x-rays? 




 The answer is NOT. 









 Upvoted for the word gimbal.

 **Man Wins Lawsuit After Neighbor Shotgunned His Drone**

That title. This is the world we live in right now. 




 Well, there's 10 unfunny minutes I'll never see again. 




 True, but they have story and dialogue, and a reason to be out in the wastes AS WELL AS picking up junk. Going out just for junk picking is the part I'm probably going to pass on.

Probably. 









 Running around picking up junk doesn't sound that fun to me. Doing quests is better. 




 But will they give us an encumberance limit that will accommodate the all the crap we'll need to be picking up? 




 Only in America. People in the UK tend to say one hundred AND twenty, or four hundred AND fifty nine. Americans seem to leave out the and altogether. 




 I also know that if you hold DOWN after throwing blanche (and after two interactions) she does a much better brutality.

Thanks for the info. 




 Yeah you can mute mid game in COD. But when you're playing a tense games of Search and Destroy and some moron joins who thinks people want to hear his shitty tinny music it can cost you the match sometimes. 




  you should have the option to mute people when you are playing

I've been saying this for years now. More games need an option to auto mute everyone by default, COD needs it badly. 




 It's totally annoying. I just go into a private party, that seems to stop their annoyances. 




 Would like to see. 




 Damn.  




 In England? 




 Ah. It makes sense to me now. Thanks for clarifying.  




 If GTAV wasn't sold out when I turned up to pick up a copy then Fallout 4 won't be. I don't think I've ever gone to buy a game on day one that was sold out. 




 Running into an immovable object is a real good way to get blown up. The trick is to approach from below, just getting to the top at stalling speed, then you don't need to slow down to land. 




 Why pre-order though? I'm just going to walk into my local GAME shop and buy it. 




 That's not flying, that's falling with style. 




 People still play Dying Light? I enjoyed it but never finished it for some reason. Haven't heard anyone mention it in months. 




 Same thing happened to me yesterday. Someone said if you uninstall then reinstall it should fix it. 




 It's not that hard to land a plane up there. 




 I don't get it. I know this that show full house. What does it have to do with generic brands and why is it funny? 




 I'm already bored of this game. It was great for the first week, but now I've got 97 dwellers and all rooms unlocked besides the Nuka cola one there really isn't anything left for me to do.  




 Anyone know when pred drops? 




 Too late. It hurt. The door was spiked you see.  









 Yeah, I just had to get it off my chest. 














 Isn't that modifier for infinite meter? 




 Or when Sub Zero uppercuts the forzen opponent's head clean off then tells them to "Feel the chill of despair". 




 I literally don't understand any of the comments I've read here. Something about Game of Thrones? 




 Skyrim. 




 I didn't know. Not everyone keeps up to date with all the upcoming content. I didn't know about the infrared skin until today either.  




 I don't like the way the article claims the Jurassic World is a reboot to the original when it's actually a sequel.  




 Well that's just awesome then.
