 Just think, to today's teens, the 90s music is as far away from them as the 70s music was for me. The first Iraqi war is as far away from them, as Vietnam was for me. The fall of the Berlin Wall is as far away from them as the Moon landing was for me. 




 Where can I get Catholic shoes? BTW. 1996 called, they want their slang back. 




 Nobody has "came back from the dead".  what's your point?   Show me an EEG and an EKG that are flatline.  Prove it medically.  When "miracles" are the cited source, PROVE IT! 




 I've seen a lot of shit on Saliva.  Doesn't make it true though.  (and I've seen some wild shit). 




 I had a seizure and remember this:

"We're taking you to the hospital"

"Take off your clothes."

"Strip.  Chain too."

"QUIT MAKING ME DRUNK!"

"Follow my finger"

"Sup?"

That's it.  When I was halfway there, I don't remember much at all.  Other than I almost decided to fight the doctor because I thought he broke into my house.  I never thought I would get ID'ed by my dog tags, but I guss I was laying on my wallet.  Good thing I have them. 




 I wasn't trying to kill myself, and I don't think I'm fat and ugly because I'm fat, and if I only weigh less I'll be better looking.  I was just feeling like shit, so I didn't eat for a while, and then once a week passed and I was feeling OK again, I was waiting for the "I'm hungry" signal again to eat, but it never came.  Hence 19 days with no food, and ending up in the hospital for seizures.  

All my step mom, (that is basically my mother since she and my father raised me since I was 2), was "Why do you always have to learn things the the hardest way possible, I have tried to tell you numerous times about the importance of eating, but no, you had to go get yourself hospitalized for starvation."  That didn't make me feel very good.  Another friend besides the one who threatened to tell her mom told me that she has a room that I can move into and if she needs to treat me like one of her kids, she will. :(

I never realized how many people cared what I do, even if I did it completely unintentionally, and didn't intend on killing myself through starvation.  It's not like I intended on passing out in the middle of WM and being hauled off to the hospital.  My truck was still in the WM parking lot when I was discharged, and I left the windows down and the keys in the ignition.  Yes, my truck was still there, (but the interior was wet because it rained).  Thank dog my seats are leather, I was just able to wipe it off and sit down to drive it away.  

I don't think I have anorexia, but yes, I have 2 appointments with mental health professionals, an appointment with my physician, and now I have to take Keppra, and make an appointment with a neurologist because I had a seizure. :(  One good thing about Keppra, my hand tremors have stopped, and now I don't have dry heaves in the morning when I wake up, so it is doing some good. :) 




 Nobody who has had "Near Death Experiences" has died. 




 Yeah, you get high out of your mind by a DMT dump as your brain is dying, then you have euphoric pleasure and everything is awesome, (or intriguing, or scary), and then you die.  Show me a person who has a flat EEG and EKG, and came back from the death, and I'll show you ET.  Medical proof needed.  Thier body must have assumed room temperature.  (complete death).  "Near death" is not "death".  I was "near death" when I collapsed because of starvation.  I didn't see shit. 




 So have I, it's called Salvia Divinorum 20x extract.  Want to be transported to a different planet?  I have some shit that will take you there for about 20 minutes.  Still doesn't make it real though.  (PSST:  DMT dump; your brain gets you high to make death pleasurable).  Hell, I have a KILO of it.  I can send you so far out, you forget what Earth even is.  Does that make drug-induced psychosis real?  Of course not.

 Wal-Mart. 




 The first two things in your last paragraph did happen.  My friends are pissed off at me and concerned.  One is threatening to tell her mom who is a refugee from the Viet Nam war.  She'd be pissed off because she fled that shit, and here I am in the USA doing it to myself.  

I've already seen the documentaries on TV, (I'd leave too).  I really don't want to hear a first hand account of them boiling bark just to make soup so they can eat *something*.  She says if I get much worse, she's going to tell her, and I'll likely get forced to eat. :( 




 I sort of have to.  I got prescribed Keppra to prevent seizures.  :(  I have to make an appointment within the next 14 days.  A good part about the medicine is that the shakes in my hands since I've had forever, and my dry heaves that I've been having in the morning for the last decade are now gone.  :) 




 I felt like shit for a week, so I just didn't bother with it since I felt like if I ate, whatever went down would come up. Then after a week, I felt OK, and I wasn't hungry, so I just didn't eat. I figured I would eat when I felt hungry, (like I usually do). That hungry feeling just never came, so I didn't eat. Wrong decision. I had to get IV feed for a day because I physically could not eat for the first day. The second day, I tried eating, and tried to eat a cup of clam chowder, a small saucer of apple sauce and a soda. I couldn't finish it. The day of discharge, I was eating a normal sized meal for a 12 year old, (half a plate of spaghetti), but still got full. I still can't polish off a whole can of denty moore's beef stew. I can only eat about half of it.

Now my friends are pissed at me, and one is threatening to tell her mom who is a Viet Nam refugee because she outran that shit, and here I am "in the land of the plenty" doing it to myself.  She'd be pissed, and give me a first hand account of how bad it was there.  I've seen the documentaries, (I'd leave too on an inner tube), so I really don't want to hear a first hand account of it.  Her mom would be pissed, and would probably force feed me.

 I was recently in the hospital because I had a seizure in WM, (turns out you can't not eat for 19+ days and expect to function normally), and collapsed to the floor.  I remember getting batteries, standing up, and then waking up in an ambulance.  Then passing out again.  Then getting told to strip in the ER and put on a gown, (my chain too).  Then "you make me feel drunk", and then waking up in a hospital bed.  Did I have any "OOBE", or anything between those periods of consciousness?  Nope.  Nothing.

 *"Sir, we at Inland Telephone serve the city 60 miles away, and have the same lines, so we can give you local calling rates at $0.10/min.  However, the house served 2 miles away from you is run by GTE, and you have to run through our switches to connect you to ATT, which connects you to the competitor's line.  We have to pay a connection fee twice, so we pass that charge on to you.  If you like, we can set you up with a 200 minute LD plan for only $19.95/mo."*

NOW LETS DO THE MACARANA!  :D 




 Remember not having to dial the area code to call long distance within the area code?  I was pissed when we had to start dialing the area code to call Pullman.  Go figure, now I can do exactly this with my cell phone, but long distance doesn't really exist anymore.  (well, TMO still has regional calling, and small regional carriers, but nobody else).  

I remember having to dial a code to roam, then turn off my phone for 15 min, then turn it back on.  Billed at $2.50/min to roam.  Then when entering your service area, you had to enter ANOTHER code, turn your phone off, and back on again, and now you're not roaming anymore, so it's only $1.00/min. 




 Because in the "days of the landline phone", if you wanted to dial long distance out of your area code, you had to dial 1, (USA National Code), to signal that you need access to the national trunk to ATT.  The format was (011)+(country)+(area)+(phone).  So if you were in England, and wanted to call Moscow ID, it would be 011+1+208+882+4571.  But if you're in Colton WA, (since it is in the same country, it would just be 1+208+882+4571.  There also used to be other trunk codes such as 00 to relay by satellite. Cellular phones, (for domestic calls), automatically insert the 1, so you don't have to.  Remember station to station calls?  $2/min in the 90's.  Hell, I bet you're too young to remember long distance, and 10-10-xxx codes dialed before the number. :)

They actually still exist for international calls:

 How about TWC? 




 Dude has a friend who found out, and her mom is from viet nam, and not only outran the war, but also starvation.  She'd be pissed off if she heard about the dude being too lazy to cook "in the land of plenty" and emanciating himself like was common in viet nam during the war when they had no choice.  Dude doesn't want friend's mom to find out. 




 But why an IV drip of saline and nutrients because for the first 24 hours the dude can't physically eat at all, (but somehow still has to shit because of the IV feed), (and needs help to the john because he's too weak to walk by himself), and not allowed out of bed unattended for 2 days).  And why did when one of his friends find out is she threatening to tell her, (not the dude's), mom [who is a Viet Nam refugee] exactly what's he did to end in the hospital, and is she going to hit him?  Dude's already seen Viet Nam on TV, and doesn't really want to hear first hand accounts of it. 




 And then when human gains consciousness, he can only eat 1/2 cup of clam chowder, a small saucer of applesauce, and half a soda before being "full" to the point of not being able to physically eat any more; but does better the second day and can eat a normal sized meal for a 12 year old; even though he's a 32 year old man?

 It only really disturbs it if you don't mulch-mow.  If you bag, you won't build up the turf and recycle the nutrients into the soil.  For the healthiest lawn, mulch.  Also, Don't mow in the same pattern twice.

 That's why they come with cargo reention straps.  If you strap down your cargo, (properly secure your load), then there is no increased danger. Anything not stapped down will become a flying object and potentially lethal.  It doesn't matter if you're in a 89 Mustang, or a 1997 Blazer LT.  I got injured by my sub flying forward in my 89 mustang, because I didn't have it secured down.

 I was on the tractor because the fields aren't going to plow themselves, and yes, I did fix the fence.  I fucked up, so I had to fix it.  It was just the property line, so I decided to "do it later"  Um yeah, 2 hours later when my dad found out.  I didn't get any punishment beyond having to fix the fence there.  

I wasn't let allowed anywhere near the torch for a year but I did get hit there.  I deserved it.  I'm never using a torch near a dry field again.  After seeing how fast fire spreads, I won't even light my cigarette in the field, because one careless spark, and the whole fucker goes up in flames.  Of course, it does help that not at 32, I kind of learn a life time of lessons on shit not to do.

 He actually hijacked the existing Moon god Allah, and used it for his own purposes, so he had a captive audience at the time.  (ME peganism).

 If I held a pistol to your head, and you refused to convert, then you didn't, so I killed your family members while making you watch, wouldn't you convert?  Oh, and I'd leave behind one of my military escorts to make sure you didn't detract from the faith either.  Detraction = death to the rest of your family, and to you.  Conversion at the point of a sword is very persuasive.

 




 I have a digital converter, and I get 4 channels.  Yay?  PBS, CBS, and ABC.  But ABC is turning off soon.  Mandatory cut off for repeaters.  Hence, I hooked up my TV's to satellite and cable.  I only have cable because I have the exact tools that TWC has, (except for a ladder truck and safety gear). 




 Having to deal with that if I want more than 4 channels, (one I'm about to lose), without cable service.  I can get K40EE, and KLEW too.  Other than that, I get ... PBS.

 Which I am.  Back before the transition, I was basically living **in** an antenna to get decent reception.  I had multiple loops of wire, and strings just to get a decent signal.  I turned my entire room, (and later apartment), into a giant antenna just to watch TV.  Now without using extreme measures like that, I get ... 4 channels), and one of them is going dark at the end of the month.  K40EE is turning off at the end of the month. 




 http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f09ad6fb825a

Before the transition, I could get 2,3,4,6,7,10,12,22,24,28,35,40,48.  Now I can get 3,10,12,40.  And K40EE is shutting off in a couple of weeks. 




 I still do use an analog TV upstairs, and did think about it, (my ex gf saw my media collection, and says I have enough to run a station for several years).  I'm not doing it though because I'd get nailed by the FCC. 




 I mean the poor people recruited get no tangible benefit.  I'm not talking about the charity cases reliant on the food bank, but just minimum wage workers that see a local church in town, and decide to go, and then the hat is passed around and you feel like a damned tool if you don't put at least a couple cents in the hat before passing it down the line.  

All for nothing that can't be proven.  (unless you can send cameras to the afterlife).  But there are more Christian denominations than passages in the bible.  Destitute people need the churches for charity works, and I understand it's an out reach program.  But the working poor don't need it.  I'd have no problem with charity drives, like standing in front of a store and passing out fliers that say "food for the needy, this is what we need" to every customer.  Hell, one day, I gave over $200 in food to a church that did exactly that.  (I had extra money that month, so what the hell).  They were kind of surprised when they asked "what's here for us", and I just said "The entire buggy". and walked off.  Somebody did it for me a long time ago when I was in need, so I did it for somebody else that I will never even meet. 




 Then why is my TVFool so shitty?

 You're really going to have a logical discussion with a a 12 year old on why he should watch where he's going when backing up?  Really?  Fuck that.  Make him fix the fence he backed over.  He fucked it up, he fixes it by himself.  Yes, bring him water and food, but "You fucked up, you fix it".  That's completely reasonable.  Burn down 1.4 million dollars of ranch land, and lose some cattle and a barn?  I deserved it.  Never trust a 14 yo kid with a backpack blow torch.  Bad mistakes can happen. Dad running for the tractor and going to make a fireline to save what crops remain then coming home isn't fun.  I should have known better, but it was my first time being let loose by myself with the torch.

 That explains it!  I've wondered that for a while.  I'm a full grown man, and that look still sends me the message that I fucked up.  But my punishments were a little more severe than a swat on the ass. 




 Depends on how much you mean, "short" and "long".  

Immediate future?  A lof of calls from collection agents.  

Intermediate future?  You'll get sued and have a garnishment order against you.  You WILL repay.  You can't outrun the IRS.  

Long term future?  You ruined your credit score for 7 years.  You can't bankrupt it.  You can't outrun the debt unless you leave the country.  

Longer term future?  (10+ years), Nothing.

 They are large gaseous objects that gather together under the force of gravitation and electromagnatism.  Then because of the heavy gravitational forces, they collapse upon themselves and form a star and planets.

They are destroyed by the collapse into a formation of several stars, (usually), and they drift away according to the spin that the underwent while the nuclear reaction went critical, and formed planets, and debris and shit.  They are made out of mostly hydrogen and helium, but also a few other elements going all the way down to uranium. 




 Minimum time?  A pico second as measured by the official time clock in Boulder CO.  Maximum, about 10 billion years from the Hubble.  It means nothing other than we can measure the speed of light, and can see that far back into the past because the speed of light isn't instantaneous.  

FTL is impossible as known to the laws of physics as we currently understand them, but if you can figure a way around it, you'll get to be a billionaire, and win the nobel prize.  

Hypothetically, if you could build a telescope the size of the Moon, and send it out 65M LY away, yes, you could watch the destruction of the dinosaurs.

Fun fact:  It takes about 1.25 seconds to contact the Moon one way, and 15 minutes to mars.  (speed of light is about 299,792,458 m/s)  If the sun burnt out right now, we wouldn't know for about 8 minutes.

 I wasn't trying to shill or troll, I was just trying to have a good time, and I thought everybody would have a good laugh at it.  I guess I failed there.  What started as a joke post very quickly turned into a serious discussion.  I know trolls just post asshole shit to get people angry, but what's a shill? 




 Davey Crocketts are tactile nuclear weapons low yeild. 100T payload.  Set it not to launch, and detonate on a timer, (much like an IED).  Have 4 vans parked in the garage, and one at each exit/entrence.  Blow them both at the same time. Total failure, and explosion.  Wait until noon for mass casualties 70,000 people per building.  Then blame it on some rouge terrorist group from somewhere.

That would work much better than a few dumbasses with box knifes flying airplanes into buildings.  Doing that would cause a complete massive uproar and a move to join the military, and kill whoever they blame it on unseen since forever.  If I wanted to stage a terrorist attack, it wouldn't be too hard as the President, and the effects would be long lasting.  EMP the USA. That would take about 2 days to plan, and cause hundreds of millions of people to die, and decades to fix.  This report was released the same day as the 9/11 commission report.  Yes, they were hiding something, but it wasn't 9/11.

http://www.empcommission.org/

**EDIT:**  It wouldn't even take a semi-automatic weapon to get mass casualties.  Just the stampede effect.  Get a couple dudes into the Superbowl with a string of firecrackers, and shoot off 1 round each from each position.  Set off the strings, and shoot one random person.  Stampede effect, and then the media could blame "maniacs with machine guns" for the thousands of people being stomped to death, when what? 4 people are killed because of hostile action?

That's how to terrorize a population.  Can you imagine that reaction?  Not only several thousand people being injured/killed because of the stampede effect, but also millions of people watching on TV live?  That's the way to do it.  Even if I was planning a terrorist plot, I can think of better shit than 9/11 to do.  The airplanes would only be the start.  Then the car bombs go off at every entrance, then the parking garage bombs would go off, and set trains to explode when the pass under it. 9/11 was run by somebody that didn't know what he was doing. 




 I know exactly how I would do it.  Ever heard of "car bombs", and 2 Davey Crockett misslies planted to detonate at an exact time.  Then forbid examination by presidntial order because it's just too dangerous", and then let FEMA and emergency personell in?  It wouldn't exactly be hard if it were a government consperacy on 9/11. 









 LSD is a hell of a drug. :)  I've seen some pretty wild shit too. :)  But do I think those 2" tall people are truly running this machine that only see as an end table not on drugs?  Nope.  It's just acid man. 




 Nah, I just thougt y'all would get a laugh.  While I hate to quote a blowhard, "Illustrate absurdity by being absurd".  There's a difference between not believing that U93 was taken down by civillians, (doesn't add up, and I'd shoot it down); v. Lizard men living at the center of the earth and Obama is a shape shifter and also the queen of england because you never see them at the same place at the same time) 




 I don't believe that it was a malicious plot that was founded by the bush administration, (too much of an idiot to pull it off), but I honestly do think that United 93 was shot down with justification but credited to the American passengers aboard because to give them a "silver lining in a dark cloud" on that horrific day.  I'd do it to, and they had reason to be shot down.

Building 7 fell down because of the massive fires that were raging in the tower for over 12 hours, and when I think they said "pull it", they were referring to "let it burn and get the hell out".  I didn't see any cranes that day, and it takes several weeks to set up a demo team..  Ever heard of the think known as "collateral damage" from shrapnil?  Shit happens man.  Sometimes that shit sucks, but it's still shit.  Just because you accidently stepped in a cow patty, doesn't mean it was set there on purpose. 




 1 I saw it on facebook and thought it was funny, so I thought y'all would get a laugh from the stupidity.

2.  Sort of, my old HS bully showed up and treats me like I'm her kid (all over again), but that has nothing to do with it

3. Nope.  I just think that the 9/11 people are full of shit.

4.  I wish.

5.  No, I'm not a racist, (by definition, segregation of a group of people based on external appearances or color is racist).

6. No, I do investigation, but I don't believe in fake moon landings, lizard people, 9/11 being operation northwoods in practice, or the Regan fake murder, or all the school shootings were faked by liberals, or that bill clinton was in contact with the mafia, or other bullshit shit.

7. You do have a lot of shit that is worth considering.  I do believe in restricted areas around nuclear power plants, (I've kind of been chased out of one), I believe in Area 51 because I can find it on Google Maps, I think more than one man was behind JFK, (but who), and that if JFK would't have gotten into a pissing contest with the russians, he wouldn't have "saved us" from the missile crisis, and that clinton started Kosovo on purpose to distract from the lewinsky thing).  I think I'm the first one to think up the last two, but I think it's true.  United 93 was shot down by the USAF.  Just listen to the tapes.  That's all you have to do.  Who is that executive aircraft?  It's the USAF. 









 Me light m1000, me throw and seek cover.  I don't want to be anywhere around those when they go off.    What did that dude light off with the burnt arm?  

M1000's are very dangerious, and I won't hold them beyond to light it, and then I throw it "away from me", and duck for cover.  I set one off last night, and the closest cover was behind my door.  I didn't even get to see it blow up, so I don't know why I lit it at all.  I cracked the sidewalk though.  Oops.  I lit it and realized "I'm holding dynamite!"  Oh shit!"  I threw it and ran. 



















 jacking, boosting, 5 finger discount, stealing, etc. 









 Drove drunk. 




 Terminator 2.  I thought it was boring.  For a while I thought "R" meant "Really dumb".  I was 8, and didn't get it.  Holy shit, most of y'all weren't alive when I watched this movie the first time. 




 Christmas day, 1991 to be exact. 




 The USSR would admit they are full of shit and don't stand a chance against the USA. 









 Holy shit!  What did that guy fire off?  That's disturbing!  I'm trying very hard not to puke right now. 




 Blind luck I guess.  I only shoot fireworks off holding them because my dad did, and he survived fine.  Roman candles have a kick, but as long as you keep it well away from your head, it's fine.  Powder burns from bottle rockets are painful, but the rockets are fucking painful. 




 Ever seen 3 bottle rockets go off at once.  That hurts, but it was cool to see. :)  I shoot them out of my hand. :)  (yes, I know they aren't called hand rockets or roman candles for a reason)  Yes, I hold those too. 




 Oh, I did, believe me.  My right hand still hurts, and I'm lucky I didn't lose it.  A mortar exploded on me (twice), a bottle rocket had a FTL, and just blew up on me, and I had a premature detonation on a firecracker.  I think I'm explosived out for the next year.  Oh, a roman candle kind of blew up on me too.  I dove for the nearest cover, (a parking berm), and got missed by what looked like an inch.  It's amazing how slow detonations are when you're running for your very life after yelling "FIRE IN THE HOLE!  RUN NOW! and running yourself.I made it 5ft before I had to jump behind the nearest thing for safety.  I'm lucky I'm alive after tonight's escapades. 




 Some dude just traded me a smoke and some fireworks for a beer.  I took him up on the offer. :)  I told him, "just don't kipe my fireworks or radio."  He was impressed with my radio setup and looked at it with his phone flashlight.  He was rather impressed. :).  I intended to give it to him for free, but he insisted on giving me a beer in trade.  I took him up on the offer. :) 




 Because I can, and know how to use my armament?  Havent really thought through "what if the soviets launch, and you have 15m before impact.  1.  Get them to safety.  2.  Lock the door.  3.  Train them somehow in a fallout shelter??  4  take back our town. 




 well I have an armament for other reasons, (havent exactly though about how to train my neighbors though in case of "bird away", yet though, but yes, mostly for fun, and rounds are expensive. 




 http://www.eadassociates.com/fa-235-508.pdf

They go first. 




 Only if 7.5" limp (according to my tape measure), is small.  I think I'm rather well endowed, and your dad does too. :D 




 Esp since I'm not in a war zone, but am armed to the teeth like I am in one.  I have enough armament to equip a fireteam.  Now to go watch explosives. :) 




 68 magazines and 5 drums.  I still have a few magazines unloaded, because if I get into that big of a firefight, I have a severe problem that I really cant fix. 




 I have over 1500 rounds ready to go, all loaded into magazines and 5 drums.  It would literally take me 2s to get it into fire mode.  (cock the handle and take it off safety, (but not the middle position because I don't need suppressive fire).  It would only take so long because I'd have to reach to my right and get it. 




 Somebody did that to me, and I would shoot that fucker out of the sky.  AKM v. civilian drone.  I wonder who's going to win? 




 You've never been on an aeroplane? 









 Today is my favorite holiday, because explosives. :) 









 Nope.  I don't even own any.  Yeah, my sex life is non-existent beyond Mrs Lefty Palmy and Righty Handy. 




 Yeah, plot line is "dude is scared out of his mind and thinks we're about to be vaporized, so he runs naked outside of his house to the neighbors thinking we only have 15m to get to shelter".

Then the porn ends badly with 15 people standing around seeing his bum and pillock flapping in the breeze while he walks home. 




 Good point.  I still don't like it when the air-raid siren goes off.  Last time it did, I ran out butt fucking naked to figure out what's going on.  It was only a drill, (obviously).  I'm sure the people didn't like it much seeing my pillock and pounding on thier door to let them know "WE HAVE INCOMING!"  He came out with me, and listened to the siren and announcements.  He just said, "It's a drill you dingus.  Go put some pants on."  I was relieved and embarrassed at the same time.  I know where the evacuation site is if it ever does come.

BTW, I was never allowed dessert.  "If you have enough room for dessert, you have some room for dinner.  Get seconds."  I was only allowed dessert on christmas, thanksgiving, easter, and the 4th of july. 




 They are.  When a vessel goes down, women and children are evacuated first because children are the weakest members of society, and they need their mothers to raise them.  Men are after women and kids because most children can't swim too well, and need to be evacuated.  Women go with the children.  Last, the men, then the crew.  It is the captain's responsibility to make sure everybody is safely off of the ship before leaving himself. 









 It's a "socially acceptable", way of saying "My god", without having to worry about being blasphemous, or violating the third commandment. 




 Because children and women and disabled people are the most vulnerable members of society, and not as strong as a full grown man.  Therefore, they are the first to be evacuated in an emergency scenario 




 Not just A delorean, THE delorean. :) 




 Getting a DUI in 2008. 




 Life is too short to be drunk all day. 




 Go fishing with your dad, he's going to be dead in 7 years, and you're going to regret that you were "too busy" go spend some time with him.  This is going to haunt you the rest of your life.  Work can be put off. 




 The back to the future car. :) 









 Going out in the parking lot across my house with me and my radio, and some beer, and watching the city fireworks show. 




 Remember friendster?  Like that. 




 Me too.  I'm aborting this conversation now. 




 Nope, can't do that.  I'm not a surgeon.  




 That's just so sad I don't know how to comment besides, I'll do it for free if you pay my airfare. :( 




 I tied in psychology, but they don't allow test posts.

My ex wife thinks I should tell my counselor, but I don't know.  I don't want to start any shit over shit that doesn't need to be started.  Should I do like she always said, and just keep my mouth shut?  I really don't want to get her in trouble, because it's been 14 years now.  I should have gotten over it, but my ex wife thinks I still act like a beaten child just trying to stay alive.


I've gotten in contact with my ex-GF from HS, and my ex wife deosn't think it's healthy, and I"ve reverted to a battered child again since contacting her, because I seem to cower when confronted with any conflict, and try and back out anyway that I can.  (well, back in 2012, I literally picked a guy up, and threw him out on the street to end a knife fight, but I only did it because I thought I had to.  It was either that or shoot him).

I think that's just dumb because I'm armed to the teeth, and have several ways to end a threat if I really need to.  I can shoot, I can fight with my knife, I can pole fight, and I can fist fight if I must.  Ideally, I'll never have to do any of it, but I can if I must.

My ex-wife thinks that I have PTSD over my ex GF from HS, but I don't think so, because only raped people and combat people get that. 




 Well, it is a skill that you could learn to make some free extra money on the side.  It's remarkably easy if you have the tools. :) 




 That's why when I smoke with a kid, (or a non smoker), in my truck, I keep the vent on high, and crack the window at least half an inch, and keep the burning part of my smoke outside of the truck.  I do exactly what my dad did, and I never noticed it as a kid, so it must work. 




 Nope.  Just saying that I know how to get free cable.  :) 




 There, you have to have some tools, and the cover of night. ;)  I know exactly how, and have done it a couple of times for friends. :)  Hooking up analog cable isn't exactly hard. 




 Not in most of the Union though. 




 Setting up a TV antenna to get as many channels as you can for free.  /r/cordcutters  




 My cat being in my bedroom with me.  She's my BFF, and I swear she can sense when I'm sick or having emotional issues.  She always cuddles with me, and makes me feel better. :) 




 Same here, but at least I could open up a window.  My mom did it all the time, but my dad always made sure his window was at least cracked so all the smoke would go out. 




 Therefore not illegal.

 What's the RCW? 




 I already did.  It's called coloboma from birth. 




 Just think, now you could potentially have night vision, or zooming vision, or xray vision.  The future is now here.  Now where to get that 100,000 USD to do it, I have no idea. 
























 Blow cigarette smoke in kid's faces, or drive around with a kid, have all the windows up, and chain smoke after engaging the child safety locks on the windows. 




 Yes, I just drove him into town because his car broke down.  They paid me $50 for my efforts. 









 I never got rid of my FDDs until 2011.  Yes, I had more than one. :) 




 That's why he had the nickname "The Intimidator".  Yes, he was a bully on the track. 




 Everything. 




 Pull out my pistol and shoot them in the head. 




 The weather. 




 Slang. 




 Nothing. 




 Well practiced in the Fine Art of Fellatio. 




 I started watching in 93,  Sunday was "raceday", and that was my dads and I "church".  18 Feb 2001 was the last day I ever watched it and was enthusiastic about it.  It didn't work in 2010 when I tried to get back into it.  The Daytona 500 in 2001 was the last complete race I ever watched. 




 Why would you put a full restraint in a semi?  You have a lot of mass, and even a piddly ass seat belt would do you fine.  Do they have semi races now?  O.o  All I know was in my 77 impala (dual quads) dropped in 454, NV4500 with corvette servos. (14s QM)  I couldn't reach shit beyond my stick and wheel.  Yes, I had more power than I would even know what to do with now as a 32 year old man.  Yes, I can still roast my tires if I really want to, (actually not even trying, I've done it by accident), but a 16 year old kid has no business with that much power.  I was getting 301.1 BHP as measured by dynamo.  I "only" have 290 now, according to the spec sheet of the 350 I dropped in with a 700R4 tranny. 




 Seatbelts are obsolete.  And yes, they are more comfortable than a full track setup.  I'd like to see you to even try and change the radio station, or reach your map in a full restraint harness.  Not gonna happen.  The last time I was strapped in, (in 1999), I could reach the wheel, and the stick.  Nothing else.  I may as well have not had a radio.  (well, I was racing, so I didn't use it anyways, but you know what I mean). 




 I was 17 when I saw that race.  My dad turned changed the channel in the livingroom when the wreck happened, so I went to my room to see what was going on and who won.  IIRC, it was about 40m later when the news came that earnhardt was killed.  I ran out of my room as fast as I could, (literally running in the house).  "DAD  EARNHARDT IS DEAD!"  "What?"  "Earnhardt?"  "yeah"  IS DEAD!"  "Bullshit"  "Come into my room, it's on TV now!"  "Oh my god"  Then starts crying just sitting on my bed.  He left.  

Never watched NASCAR again together.  I tried again in 2010, but it just wasn't the same.  The cars looked different, and one of the best drivers in the world got killed.  It just didn't work.  I think I lasted for an hour, and then changed the channel, it just didn't feel right.   









 My ex GF sent me that video after I told her that I have "the need for speed" and asked her about the nearest track.  "Before you go, you might want to watch this.  You were crying to me in HS over it."  I watched it, and now I don't have a "need for speed" anymore.  I completely forgot about it before she reminded me.

Sorry, I was just trying to spread the word, that speed kills, and be responsible.  I know it's not LEO related, but I didn't know where else to post it besides /r/cars 




 Yeah, my ex GF just sent me that video.  Thanks. :(  If you gotta race, keep it on the track, but don't race, because that's still dangerous.  I remember telling my dad that day, he didn't believe me until he came into my room and saw the live news broadcast.  He just sat on my bed and cried, and we never watched NASCAR again.  I tried in 2010, but it just wasn't the same.  One of the best drivers in history got killed, all because of a $140 piece of equipment, (HANS restraining device).  Now I don't want to race at all.  I guess she accomplished her goal.  I had a "need for speed", now I don't.  Pretty morbid video to watch, but better than a "serious discussion". 




 I broke the news to my dad that day, "Earnhardt is dead!". He didn't believe me until he came into my room and watched the broadcast. He was crying. We never watched NASCAR again I remember that day well. He said "what?" I said "Earnhardt?" he said "yeah?" I said " IS DEAD". We walked back to my room, and I still had the TV on, and he watched for about a minute, sat down on my bed, and just started crying. I tried in 2010, but it's just not the same. One of the best drivers ever got killed, and I can't watch it anymore. 









 Why punish the users?  Isn't this a bit like dad having a bad day at work so he comes home to hit his kids? 














 It wasn't something I did, is it?  Great, now I feel like I'm 12 again. :( 




 Not illegal, but SWIM got laughed at a couple of times, and feels like an even bigger ass because SWIM basically said "I saw it on TV" to the aeroport administrator.  And SWIM called because I don't think they would really SWIM SWIM showing up with cutters, and opening the tarmac for a drag race.  SWIM doesn't really want combat patrol coming over the horizon and re-enacting the Saigon surrender, without anywhere to swim off to, or a boat, or a batallion off of shore to flee to) 




 () | ^ | ()  That's what I got to say about that. 




 Because old habits die hard with a vengeance?  (Yay, I actually used a movie title in normal conversation!) 




 That's what my ex GF said, and my mom too.  I thought I could because the BBC does, but Now I'm just trying to find a closed road so I can.  (I'm not going on the aeroport tarmac without explicit permission). 




 The last time I was up there, I saw a jetcar explode.  I'm not really sure I want to go on that track.  Yes, the dude was alive, but barely.  I sort of chickened out after seeing that, and I only had a 10M wait until I was "next up".  Seeing a giant fireball 20M in front of me kind of made me put it into drive and leave the track.  Plus, it would cost me about $50 in gasoline to get up there.   




 Pullman WA.  The nearest one is over 100 miles away in StateLine ID.

**edit:** and now you know why I street drag. My old GF says that my truck is in no condition to race though, and "remember dale earnhardt?  He was a professional driver."  I remember that race well, thanks  Killed with 4 laps to go during the daytona 500 in 2001. 




 God damn it.  Even exhibition permits (close down streets and race), are $175/hr.  My old GF says that I should just let it go, and if she catches me me going to have a "very very serious discussion" if I do it unlicensed. :(

That explains why top gear can do it but I can't! :)  I thought I could because top gear does.  Nope. 




 SWIM = Someone Who Isn't Me.  You probably don't know because you don't go to https://drugs-forum.com/forum/ 




 OK, I can't rent the aeroport either.  :(  Any closed roads around? 




 Shit.  That explains it.  The lady on the phone just laughed at SWIM and said "I can't let you do that". and started laughing again.  SWIM even told her about Top Gear, and they race on tarmac all the time, but that generated even more laughter. O.o.
