 I've run into a deadly, shadowy figure. Some call him the Hash-Slinging Slasher based off the Spongebob Character. 




 What Podcasts? I love PKA, TPS, Movie Fights by Screen Junkies, and the Dubl D's podcast. 




 Left, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right, etc 




 I transform from huge robot with mechanical guns attached to my shoulders to a seemingly normal human body (Upgraded version of my current body with abs and more muscular contour). They will call me 'FuckBitchesAquireRiches Prime'...still working on the name. 




 Don't be fooled. I thought skating would be much easier than it looks but I learned I was wrong and thank god it wasn't the hard way. People still bring up that girl's unfortunate fall and we're about to be seniors in highschool... 




 Could've been great at music producing at an earlier age, born into a more richer family to buy necessary software, and make it big on youtube. 16 and still got some time left tho. 




 We went to San Francisco for an 8th grade trip and one of the things we did were go ice skating outside in the middle of the city. Keep in mind, I can't skate period, and I remember holding on the the side railing the entire time on the ice as I slowly walked around the rink one time before deciding to get off the ice, regretting the wasted 20 dollars renting the skates. Just as I was about 5 feet away from the exit, I look to my right to see a girl who had seemingly got the hang of skating until, and I shit you not, her skates completely malfunctioned under her feet and let me tell you...there was no time inbetween this chick skating perfectly and her face planting while sliding in the wall head first. Never wanted to laugh so hard in my entire life...I'm going to hell. 




 I'd be careful for those who decide to take your girl out ice skating.

 Could you draw me up a logo? Something involving the letters 'SW'. Sleek but interesting that I could use on all my instrumentals, images, and profile pics on social media. I'm a music producer. 




 I saved a frog from near death. It was trapped inside of a 2-liter plastic 7-up bottle. 




 Me as Batman paired with unlimited money for amazing special effects, the best writers/directors on the damn planet, and non-stop advertisments everywhere. Upon release date, Billionaire Status. Become Batman in real life. 




 You might be right. 




 What kind of accent? I've heard people who speak proper english say both all the time. 




 That shit is annoying too hahah 




 I use toilet paper, but think about it. If you got shit all over your arm, is the best way to clean to wipe it with a paper or to wash it. Whole different perspective. I still use toilet paper only though :( 




 Interesting... 




 Not sure if both pronounciations are correct but one of them just sounds incorrect and it irritates me. Its honestly a pet-peeve of mine. In my mind:

* Correct: Sen-air-ee-o

* Incorrect: Sen-ar-ee-o

Edit: The latter is used in Britain most likely, but is cringeworthy when an American with no distinguishable accent pronounces it. 




 Fuck you, Trump.

 Tory Lanez 




 ??? Believe it or not, I haven't seen Park n Rec. Saw first episode and thought it was a rip-off of 'The Office' which I loved. Everyone was annoying and I only laughed once in the episode in the very end when the dude with the mustache said something about a gun or maybe something about the flag idk I forgot. Seriously though, I'm talking from experience about my fecal situation. You've never had a dry shit? 




 Most people who claim to have insomnia don't. Usually they're doing something that stimulates their brain which can be anything from the emission of blue light from your Iphone or laptop (which actually stimulates you the most of different light types which I won't get too deep into) or even having a simple source of light like a lamp or nitelight which could confuse your brain into thinking it's still day-time and prevents from certain chemicals in your brain which help get you drowsy. I have sleep problems too. Sleep at 4am, wake at 2pm depressed that I only have a couple more hours of day light to be productive. Vicious cycle. 




 Why?  




 I've seen Dexter and Breaking Bad twice through   




 I liked the Office better 




 Christian Bale. He's actually quite a douche if you've seen some videos or heard stories of him behind the scenes. He's the guy who will cuss you the fuck out because you brought him a bowl of green M M's when he likes red. 




 Piano 




 Wait for the boner to go down. 




 My pocket. 




 So your wife... 




 Reddit-ing. Hours gone, too deep in to leave now. 




 Gif has slow motion option. Your welcome. 




 Seems to be a problem though. From what you have said, it sounds like you brush at night, mouthwash in the morning, and brush again after lunch. So, you're brushing two times a day which can be bad like you said. I would skip brushing after lunch and just brush at night but then I feel like my breath would stink even with mouthwash throughout the day.  




 No, they moved to /r/Dumponmychest  




 Birds eat worms, eventually shit and provide nutrients to soil that in turn grow into humans that get chopped down by birds to make human houses for trees, right? Explain to me, I'm like 5.
