 Top notch post 




 I'm on my phone so maybe I can reference an article later. Essentially, I think Mexico should do something to make their country a more attractive place to live. I also think they benefit from the drug trade as evidenced by helping that drug lord escape. I appreciate your honesty. 




 Yeah I learned about it a bit in my one quantum physics class, we talked about harnessing solar energy. We're just really bad at keeping it and storing it efficiently. The transistors that we use need to be more advanced. Elon Musk is the great innovator of our time. 




 Yeah we need to get off fossil fuels for sure. Pollution like in Beijing is abhorrent. Fossil fuels are nonrenewable. Actually here's one of my favorite facts. The sun creates more energy in one second than mankind has ever used. Just imagine if we could harness that. It'd be amazing. 




 Good. Oil is more efficient and has higher energy density right now. Allow the free market to invent green power, keep the Feds out of it. 




 I might listen to that podcast or read some ridley articles because I'm honesty a neophyte in debating this. Essentially, I believe the climate is changing, I just don't think we know to what extent it's changing. 




 I was just thinking how Obama gave $500m to Solyndra 




 There's phony/deceptive science on both sides. I think the difference here is that the green Movement is state supported, and we live in a generation of activists. 




 CO2 also promotes plant growth, since it is their food.  




 There's nothing glaring really. There's just a lot of money and incentives for scientists to prove their points right. Ridley talks about this one graph (forgive me for forgetting the minutia)  that was influential in climate science. In this graph there was a set of points that were in the graph inappropriately to skew the way people interpreted. They did it knowingly. Ridley found this out and removed the false data and it wasn't as scary as once made to believe. 




 Aright I'm doing this from my phone so bear with me though typos and formatting.

First off, I don't think using Wikipedia as your main source of argument isn't that damning, but I entertained it. Wiki says, "usually by not slowing police or municipal employees to inquire about an individual's immigration status." That's fine, I understand why they wouldn't. 

However, the article referenced in [Ref 1](sfgate.com/bayarea/article/newsom-says-s-f-won-t-help-with-raids-mayor-2600450.php) says Mayor pledges to discourage Feds' immigration sweeps. Essentially, he will do nothing to stop illegals from wanting to come to his city. They are illegal immigrants and actively defying US law by residing here without proper citizenship.

In my eyes when you defend sanctuary cities like this, you are endorsing illegal immigration.

You can begin to cut murder/violent crime rates by removing illegals. Having illegals certainly won't increase the crime rate! It's a crime to even be here. If you think illegals keep the crime rate down because of all the vigilante-like crime reporting they're doing then I'd love to see that source.

You can also argue they want a better life and I empathize with them on that. I think US needs to do something about it with out Mexico relations. Shame on them for turning a blind eye and complete unwillingness to help out their own citizens. The Mexican government is smuggling their drug lords out of jail and refusing to extradite them to America where they can be convicted and proven guilty without a doubt.

In SF, it is a get out of jail free card. It just is. It's not even about inquiring about every single Latino person, it's that they are actively inviting laws to be broken. 

I have nothing against Latinos. I have a problem with breaking US laws whether you be white, black, yellow, green, or any other sort of color.

Deportations have dropped by 35% in SF in the past 3 years and in the USA alone it has been the lowest number in over 40 years. 




 Here's how I feel about the whole climate debate. Matt Ridley actually has a lot of views I like. He's more of a climate lukewarmer. I think humans are affecting the environment negatively, however, I think politicians and powerful people are exaggerating the immediate effects of it. 

Matt Ridley has studied this extensively and has called bullshit on a lot of popular things that climatologists point to as "evidence". I recommend listening to the podcast EconTalk that features him. 




 Common practice for most large cities? Not true. They don't turn you over to immigration in San Francisco. That illegal immigrant that killed that American was arrested twice and released from jail in America. In what world do you live in that you want people illegally invading our country? Liberals preach about the wage gap yet support illegal immigration. It just fuels their arguments and it's bull shit. 




 I wouldn't be shocked if he didn't. John is a weird dude. I think he said when working on Stadium Arcadium he used to listen to 36 chambers by Wu Tang Clan everyday ha 




 So you honestly believe Mexico is doing anything to deter their citizens from leaving? 




 Where is Obama when the sanctuary city issues comes up?  




 Thanks, I'll remember to call Bruce by his proper pronoun next time he comes up in conversation. 




 I couldn't agree with you anymore. 




 It wasn't a typo. 




 True that homie! Life's too short to be anything but happy. Keep riding Spaceship Earth. 




 I'm a huge sports fan as well. No way I'm watching.  




 It's embarrassing that he is winning that ESPY award for bravery. 




 Yeah, no other way I'm gonna be making a million bucks a year 




 FUCKIN SICK BRO 




 You're awesome man, I'm not suicidal. We need people like you being a helping hand. Good stuff brotha. 




 I like that video, thanks for the show
 




 Foods have a common ancestor, much like animals, no? 




 Hmm. No questions about extinguishing the Jedi. I'm calling bull. 




 They are two different sports. It's like asking why lemons taste sour if peppers are spicy. Yeah they're both food. But completely different foods. 




 Thank you for being the voice of reason to all the liberals circle-jerking to conservative bashing. 




 Government oversight thats out of control 




 Once got 36 sprinkles. We used to count them. 




 Generator, in case of natural disasters and you lose power. 




 Wait for government handouts. 




 RIP Whitney 




 I got Rand Paul, but I'm also a big supporter of his. I think it's decent but shouldn't be used as your definitive response. Lucky for you though, because you have over a year to make an informed decision. Since the primaries haven't begun yet, you're in good shape. Listen to debates as they happen, find positives and negatives about each candidate before you decide. Don't judge the candidates based on their media perspective. Judge them primarily by their actions. Words are usually empty promises. See what they have actually done or tried as a judge of their character. 




 Yeah that's kinda what it is. Basically faking attacks to give you reason to enter war. So it can be tied in with the Military-Industrial Complex

So. My point is. I don't believe in 9/11 conspiracies but that could be viewed as a false flag operation. Basically, we planned the attacks to invade the middle east for oil and $$$. So the people in power were positively effected by this, people could argue. 




 That heaven exists. 




 Huh? I realize it's only a theory... but hop off a cliff, tell me how that works out for ya 




 /r/politics 




 Petered out. Nice. 




 Myself 




 My biggest recommendation is not to get your recommendation from Reddit on a particular candidate. That's not going to help you. Voting history helps and I would also see if they have their platform on their website. This site also works too, (www.isidewith.com), however, I don't know if it gives more options for one party than the other. 




 "Only My Couch Pulls Out" -- We came in 2nd at the Tilted Kilt 




 False Flag Operations? 




 You're right. Not about the right-wing blogger stuff. But I'm not gonna try to keep it going for the sake of the argument when I see your point. Deal 1 is done, onto the next one.

Did the release the specifics of the deal yet? I couldn't find any hard numbers on it. 




 I just want the administration to address the issue in some sense. 




 I would never be a part of occupy Wall Street. I believe in the free market way too much. Why won't Obama or Kerry even acknowledge the hostages? Why won't they assure the Americans that they are even attempting to bring them home? And this deal is being overblown by liberals when it does nothing to prevent Iran from attempting nukes in the future. 




 I'm as upset as you, I can't believe it wasn't even on the table. 




 This is sickening. I can't believe you would actually think that the hostages shouldn't be a part of the deal. They are AMERICANS! How can that not mean anything to you? You can say that these talks are just about nukes, but holy hell, I'll be damned if you ever hear about these hostages for a while. They are AMERICANS being held against their will without committing any crimes as far as I know. This is unjust and I can't believe this isn't even a topic of discussion. Since when does America back down from protecting its citizens? Since when does America not ensure to its people that they won't be prosecuted without reason? Unbelievable, this a joke.


EDIT: Being downvoted for caring about the American people. Suits reddit. Over zealous it may be, but damn, I just want to hear anything from this administration. 




 Eh different guitarists will do that to ya 




 Hmm I wonder if this opens the opportunity for me to start one. Except I have no idea how to run a subreddit or spread the word. 




 They like to crawl into different crevices to get out of the heat as far a I know. They used to come into my house by the AC unit. Since you're not at home I would just continuously throw them out of your car I suppose without killing them. But if you get them in your house, I always would flush them down the toilet. 




 Just another move by the New York Slimes 




 I want to have honest discussion with other redditors without fear of being downvoted into oblivion or condescended to. Also void of any half-witted jokes or memes. 




 I think he nailed it out of the park and left no stone unturned. I think, as a reader, it's really satisfying when an author does that. 




 I loved it. I'm an aero major w/ a minor in physics. So my opinion may be skewed since I have a stronger physics background than most of the general population. I thought it was goo background and introduction to people who aren't that familiar with theoretical physics. To be completely honest, If you're interested in that sort of stuff I wouldn't start with this book. There are hundreds and hundreds of videos that will bring you up to speed quicker, and then you may wanna revisit this. 




 American Gods is a good read, I read it 4 years ago, and want to revisit it when I can. I love mythology though, so that helped. 




 **Taking A Stand, Rand Paul**
 




 Great book. I loved all the modern day mythology in it. Sort of, what would todays gods look like? 




 If there is any republican that I think democrats would respect, it's Rand. However, I don't know how you feel about him. Clinton is way too much of an untrustworthy politician. 




 I'm not saying who I think will win or anything like that. Just wondering who you guys would support.

Would you still vote? Would you vote for whomever gets the democratic nomination? Maybe vote for an independent or a moderate republican? 




 I had to do an english paper on it years ago. I saw it at a bookstore asked my teacher if I could do it, he said yeah. I never heard of the book before, but thought I'd give it a try. Glad I did. 




 Thats the kind of company I want to work for hah 




 Yeah I have a fear of commitment anyway 




 And We Won't GET FOOOOOOOLED AGAIN, since no one else recognized your reference. 




 I support gay marriage and I'm against the ruling. So many liberals look past a major reason for conservative arguments. It gives the federal government more centralized power and chips away at the first amendment for the sake of marriage, which shouldn't be run by the government in the first place. So please take all your easy upvotes from slacktivists on reddit, we all appreciate it. There are dozens of us! Dozens!

 You act like you've carried your team anywhere, let alone the EU LCS. 




 Technically, light can't turn :O 




 This is the height of emotions for me when listening to TFC.  




 Oh man, come over to /r/pinkfloyd we love it over there 




 This is making me feel uncomfortable just to look at. Feel like I'm falling! 




 Fuck if I know, prolly about LBJ dunking a shit post in a shit basket 




 Hmm fucking a giant catfish is on your checklist? To each their own.

 Reposts 




 Forget the immense length of The Wall, and no songs had to be taken out in order to have a longer CN. Would you still keep it the same? 




 Yeah I said to my friend once that I wish the solo was longer since I could hear the fade out. He's like dude, go listen to the Pulse version NOW 




 My question can be simplified. Would you rather have Comfortably Numb from The Wall to have that really long emotional solo that features in Pulse or not? I've been listening to the Pulse version a lot lately and wonder how it would sound on The Wall, you could also argue that hearing the long solo version live for the first time was so much more impactful. I don't know. What're your guy's thoughts? 









 Then you're doing it wrong 




 I think this is a simple solution, so I will keep it brief. A lot of people have issues with Riot's transparency or unwillingness to keep us updated on promises made long ago. What if each developer team would produce a weekly update/blurb about what they were working on and how it was going. It wouldn't have to be much. For instance, while working on the death recap (Finally btw) have the team say, ran into issue X, Y, or Z still figuring it out or something. I'm not sure, I just feel like if the community had updates, they wouldn't feel so left out at times. 




 But I loved getting Thresh souls from WAY DOWNTOWN! 




 He should vote for me too! I've never been in national news ever! 




 I realize they are one in the same, but why the sudden change in language? And ISOL doesn't sound as threatening and we're still fear mongerers, no? 




 Whoops! You're right! Haha, I'm keeping it. 




 And what's mine is yours and yours is mine absolutely unmotivates me. 




 I'm a constitutional libertarian and still in college so I don't fall in the old conservative stigmatism. And I can honestly say that reddit being liberal by majority (not sure if that's true; vocal minority effect) is really annoying to me. I'm friends with liberals without much issues, but the anonymity of the Internet gives these people a megaphone and a rooftop. I'm not trying to call everyone out, but it's just the way I perceive it. I'm also a spiteful person so I'm looking forward to all the Bernie Sanders supporters to have their hearts broken at their delusional expectations. However, there are many Sanders supporters with reasonable expectations and are hopeful in a rational way. But when I see everyone vote brigading every time he takes a shit, it's really annoying. I also find solace in knowing that if he's labeled a Socialist (which he is) not many conservatives will vote for him.


Sorry about this bitter post and it felt good to get it off my chest honestly. If anyone is willing to have a normal peaceful conversation/debate that's fine by me. 




 Apes because massively stronger than humans while still being able to use tools
