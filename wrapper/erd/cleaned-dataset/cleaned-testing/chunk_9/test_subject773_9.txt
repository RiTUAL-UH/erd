 Scooter (left) is a 17.3 hand Saddlebred.  Rillo (right) is a 14.3 hand Morgan.  Also, I'm only 5'3".  Rillo and I enjoy being vertically challenged together in a barn of tall people riding Saddlebreds and Friesians. :) 









 It is Flying E!  They have such a nice facility.  My boy is digging it there, and everyone at the barn is in love with him! 




 A Morgan, actually.  In a barn of Saddlebreds and Fresians!  He's the smallest horse in the place, lol! 














 You're still laughing about it, and now I'm laughing about it too.  Fantastic!  Thanks for replying.  See you in Minneapolis on 10/29! 




 What is the most inappropriate thing you've ever laughed at?  Bonus points if it was in a situation where no one else thought it was funny.  I find myself laughing at inappropriate things often...in public.  Then the staring by innocent bystanders begins. 




 You are my hero. 









 It looks like Kim is getting a lovely shoulder rub. 




 Upvote for using the phrase "slab sided nerd."  Lol! 




 Doubly hot -- great forearms AND you were vacuuming! 




 I have multiple pairs for riding, and I also own their gardening and work gloves.  I love them!  They have a great feel, even when I'm using a double bridle, adjusting tack, etc.  And when they get gross you can just throw them in the wash with your barn clothes!  I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and they really help my hands, especially if the horse I'm riding is strong.  I can't recommend them enough! 




 Omg that last photo of him in his party hat with his tongue out is PRICELESS!  What a lucky horse he's been to have you for so long, and to have such a great life.  He looks great for 27!  Happy birthday to both of you, and tell him he doesn't look a day over 15! 




 I have a riding pair, and also a gardening pair and a work pair!  I swear by them and tell everyone I can about these gloves.  They have a great feel even when I'm riding in a double bridle, and when they get gross you can just throw them in the washing machine with your riding clothes!   














 So sorry about your loss.  She was a Morgan, right?  If so I know her breeder. 




 VERY true!  In this case you're right, I'm likely ok because it's obviously a brassica.  I normally wouldn't bother trying to eat something like this but there is such a large amount of it that it seems wasteful to not try! 









 Your dad sounds incredible!  I love that you still have coffee with him every Saturday morning.  I wish my dad was geographically closer to me so we could do that.   









 So jealous you got to meet him!  And is that Call Me Regal? 




 That's just the way the barn does it.  I don't own the barn, just ride there.  Most of the barns I have ridden at have shavings in the aisles unless the aisles are paved. 




 She's not thrilled about pastures.  Paces the fence, etc.  this is just how she's happy. :)

 




 Glowie is a 30 year old Morgan mare.  She sound of body except for some arthritis you would expect at her age, but is rather senile.  She has a stall but prefers not being in it, so the door is simply left open and she comes and goes as she pleases.  She wanders around the barn, the indoor arena, and around the farm grounds.  She is slow moving and never strays too far.  She is usually found napping, watching lessons, or raiding people's bags and purses for goodies. :)  It can be a shock to new visitors to just see her strolling around on a sunny day! 









 Tiny cute fuzzy environmentalist!  (the best kind) 




 Hah!  That's exactly why I don't like it! 




 Cushings is a tough thing.  It's great that Lenny has made it so long though!  I think Cushings is the one drawback about Morgans -- some of them just seem to be prone to it.  When we put Baby down she still looked pretty good, but was having problems moving around and walking comfortably.  Winter was on its way, so we made the decision to put her down before she got really bad.  Definitely do pictures with Lenny this summer, you'll treasure them forever!  We also had a bronze commissioned of Baby, and that is a very special thing to me. 




 I'm in MN too, so I seriously feel your pain!  And now this morning it's snowing again.  April fools?   




 Yep English.  I've done some Western at a very casual level, but I can't get used to the saddle!  There's just too much under my butt! 




 Saddleseat is fantastic and it's how I started out.  The two reins are just a double bridle, or full bridle.  They're used in lots of disciplines.  And lol about your horse running loose at shows.  My horses are all business about shows, but then are afraid of stupid stuff at home.  Rillo is deathly afraid of baby powder (even if it's on his butt), garden hoses, and COWS. 




 Actually none!  Baby's lines are here: http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/baby+ruth+mhf.  Rillo is her son, by Whispering Whamunition.  




 Baby started saddleseat but was then more comfortable as a hunter, so she became my first hunter pleasure horse.  Rillo was obviously built to be a hunter from the get-go so that is what he is too.  My 3-year old is now going to be my new saddleseat horse, probably English pleasure.  I go back and forth between seats all the time because I love them both! 




 Seriously!  Baby had abs, lol.  And Rillo is like riding a freight train even though he's not even 15 hands.   




 Nope, both Morgans :)   




 Thanks RonRonner!  We kept her happy and comfortable as long as we could.  She'd had IR problems since she was about 10, and I had to stop riding her about a year before we put her down at the age of only 16.  She had some problems keeping weight on, but never got too bad.  The farm and their staff is incredible, and I credit their expertise and diligent care when it comes to how long she stayed sound and happy.  She is buried on the farm, under the pasture where the new foals play. :) 




 Baby (the chestnut on the right) died a few months after this photo was taken from issues due to Cushings.  We did this photo shoot knowing she wouldn't be around for much longer.  I'm so glad I have this photo of the two of them!  Rillo (on the left) is her son and only offspring.  He is still my show horse. 









 Oh of course!  I know him.  Super cool horse! 




 He looks awesome!  What's his show name?   




 I deleted the first version of this because I messed up the link.  All fixed now!  Enjoy! 









 I didn't live in Melby, but had plenty of friends who did.  Yes, it's quiet, but you don't have to sneaking around.  Playing music in your room, talking with friends, watching a movie, etc. are all totally normal!  It's not freakishly quiet, don't worry.  Thorson is great too, and is a bit more boisterous, but not to the point where it's annoying.  

Just don't live in Rand.  Never, ever, live in Rand.  I lived there as a sophomore -- blech! 

Let me know if you have any more questions! 




 The barn I'm at now has 3 friesians, and I'm DYING to ride one!  




 He came to Minneapolis to speak and promote his book, so I went.  Got a free copy of his book, some great entrepreneurship advice, and an autograph! 




 I met him about a month ago and he was the NICEST guy.  Way taller than I realized (hotttttttttt), and genuinely interested in what I had to say.  I will marry him now please? 




 I just...I can't even function right now.  So good. 




 My horse hasn't had a lame day in his life, and my young colt has also had no issues at all thus far.  My mare, who we lost last year, did succumb to chronic laminitis.  This is probably the one "problem" Morgans have.  They are prone to laminitis, insulin resistance, and founder.  However, most Morgans I know were hale and hardy until their mid to late 20s.  They are indeed tough, while having beautiful refinement.  

As for ants in their pants -- I can really come down to breeding and training.  My horse can be rather fire-breathing, in the respect that he always wants to go as fast as possible!  I never really ask him to go forward, just to slow down.  When we do our extensions, I simply stop trying to slow his body and off we go!  So many Morgans I've ridden are like this -- go go GO!  But they do have great brains as well.  My gelding is often TOO smart for his own good.  He even has a full understanding of the music they play at our shows, and will try to transition into the next gait when he hears the key of the music change!

Well, when you rebuild your wallet, and if you want to look into a Morgan, you know where to find me on Reddit!  Depending on what part of the country you're in, there could be some really great opportunities.  Have you ever considered taking lessons at a Morgan barn just to try out their dressage abilities? 




 Morgans are great little dressage horses!  I have several friends who use their horses for dressage, and now Western dressage is becoming really popular as well.  If you want any Morgan dressage connections, PM me and I can get you in touch with the right folks.

Even though my horse competes in hunter pleasure, we do a lot of basic dressage exercises with him at home, especially now that we're trying to get him better with patterns.  He overthinks everything and jumps to conclusions!  The dressage work is slowing his brain down a bit. :)  Here's a pic of him doing his thing in the show ring because, well, who doesn't love more horse pictures? :)

 Thank you!  He's a Morgan. :) 




 Cool!  Also your horse is adorable and I want to squeeze his face and give him kisses. :) 




 Well, I'm not sure if this will clarify much (as reins just tend to look like a tangle), but here is my horse wearing the aforementioned rein configuration.  The bit he's wearing in this picture isn't the same one we're discussing here, but the reins are run in the same way.  Snaffle rein goes directly from hand to bit, and is clipped to the ring of the bit.  Curb rein goes from saddle, through bit ring, and doubles back.

Hope that clears things up a little!

EDIT: the curb rein also goes through the martingale.  Forgot to say that! 




 Well I would certainly love to know what she called it!  That's been the main obstacle in searching, simply not knowing what it's called.  The closest I've come is a Four Ring Bolt Bit.
