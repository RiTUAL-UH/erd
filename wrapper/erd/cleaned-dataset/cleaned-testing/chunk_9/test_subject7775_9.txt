 But not just anyone was allowed to enter. 









 That's a pretty major catfish. That's also really weird for a 13 or so year old to do. Sext with 50 year olds? Did she actually seek them out? 




 Dammit. I was hoping to never have to relive that. 




 *In enters the most useless type of person on the internet* 









 I defiantly would've felt better knowing that Serial Killers scope out my house. 




 My main goal right now is to model a weapon/firearm for the game Fallout: New Vegas. So hard surface modelling does not seem like the way I will achieve this.  




 I am very very new to 3DS Max, and I was wondering how do I learn how to model. Is there any good tutorial series? How do you self teach 3d modeling? 




 **INB4 FAKE** 




 Gosh, fix game plz. 




 The cops arrived and found him hiding in one of my neighbour's front yards. So the situation is resolved. 




 I was already in the closet when I was writing this. It is literally one of the first results I got that looked somewhat like the car. 




 I took all of the precautions such as phoning Police, calling parents and asking a friend to come check it out. Yes, I wrote it on Reddit because I thought people might be interested about this encounter. Also, yes I am writing it on my cell phone. 




 I live in a fairly small town so we don't have a lot of Police Officers around. Although I just called my dad and told him about this, He just came home. He found the car, but he didn't find the guy. 




 He isn't entering or anything. When he pulled in and I saw the model of car, I ran to my room into the closet.  




 I already have. My parents aren't home. I am sitting in my walk in closet behind multiple layers of clothing. 




 So back along time ago when I was young around the age of 8 or 7. I was a really intelligent child, but I was also athletic so I played alot of sports. So one day I decided to go down and meet some of my friends at the basketball court near my house. It was a short walk I went down the street, took a right, then a left and I was there.


Except, this day was different when I was on the way there. I was stopped by the sound of the Ice Cream Truck's music. I took a look over my shoulder and saw a car following up behind it looked similar to this: [This](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Volvo343DL1980.jpg)


I took a closer look but it was still far away, I was trying to get a glimpse of the driver. I saw his face and some of his details he had a huge nose, a fairly sized mouth but his eyes were terrifying to my 8 year old self for some reason.


He pulled up right next to me looked at me and said "Would you like some of my Ice Cream?" He was fairly tall to be driving that car so he looked quite squashed inside. I was warned of stranger danger constantly so I knew to walk faster and faster.


He followed me for a good 2 minutes, every 5 seconds his questions turned into shouts. He saw a car coming up the road then shouted at me. "I know where you live, and I'll be back!" I quickly turned around and ran back for my house and when I got back, I locked the door behind me and peaked through the blinds. Luckily he didn't follow me.


There was one small detail I didn't realise about this event because I was 8 years old, he was furiously masturbating in the front, and I no longer wish to know what he meant by "Ice Cream".


The reason I posted this is because I am now 17, and his car just pulled up in my driveway... **Please help me...** 




 No, everytime I go to the window I think that that guy will be there. 




 Teamspeak is the ultimate VOIP. Nothing can match it.
