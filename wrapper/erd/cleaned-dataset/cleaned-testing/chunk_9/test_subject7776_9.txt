 [By all means, here are some pictures of my car](http://imgur.com/a/xBliL) I think finding a Saleen is gonna be hard. ;P, You should deff blend the NewEdge colors for the banner. 




 Oh gosh, the Third Brake light got shitty on you too?
I just replaced it with raxiom's. I never really bothered to see how to fix it. But I've noticed it a lot of NewEdges. 




 I'd love to see a Saleen, Roush, Termi, and a Mach in that! And maybe my car too... ;) lmao.  




 [Me!](http://imgur.com/a/xs8SH) 




  No! 




 That god damn hood, man! Meanest looking car, and I would maybe possibly trade my car for one. 




 Fucking love the Tans Am. WS6, correct? 




 Anything is possible, my friend. 




 Correct, sir! 




 [Imagine this, but with your car](http://i.imgur.com/qTas1lJ.jpg) 




 I couldn't find it.. :( I made it all flarey and purple and blue and stuff.
God damn it. 




 I edited this picture a long time ago, I'm gonna see if I can dig it up! (I did a shit job tho) 




 I love MG!  




 I know. I'm saying I want an 01. 




 I'll just take the 10th Anni off your hands, real quick. 




 NewEdge 4 Lyfe. 




 I NEED one. There was one for sale near by, but 400$, and poor 18yr old = no new bumper. 




 Termi hood, 01 cobra bumper, paint and invisible bra. i'd be set for life. 




 How much did you get, god damn. 




 Stangmods has them, 200$ and MrBodyKit has them for like 160$ he has regular and smoked. 




 Hurry, someone back into my front so I can get an 01 Cobra bumper. 




 It won't be stock for long ;) gonna get an exhaust set up as soon as my tax refund gets here, then lower it, CAI, Gears. Just gotta save money here and there. Things surprisingly quick. I feel like the 0-60 time has to be off, it doesn't feel like 5.4 seconds at all. I definitely am more of a "look good" type of guy. At least at this point, since I went from 145HP to 260HP and it was quick the difference. DSG is easily one of the best colors for NewEdges, or really any mustang. It hides dirt and dust pretty good, it's just rock chips that it shows like no other.  Hopefully you get your GT sometime in the near future. So much fun. 




 I try really hard.  




 Ooo. Is it Torch Red? Cause that shits my fave. And I want a gen 2 lightning so bad...  I appreciate it man! 




 Shucks... Thanks man! 




 Believe me, I didn't either! I had to ask around on IG to see where people got them. 




 Stop, I'm blushing.  




 StangMods has them, and MrBodyKit has normal and smoked. If I found the smoked ones, I would have gotten those, they look really good. 




 And faster ;) 




 DSG 4 LYFE!!!!! 




 Good move. :) 




 Thanks man, I thankfully have a friend whose a great photographer and is easy going.

DSG is the best. That, and Torch Red.. and Mysti.... 




 Hopefully. Maybe he'll start small like the rest of us, I went from a 95 v6 to an 04 GT. 




 Pretty much, only changes are:
Clear corner headlights (Raxiom Elite bulbs)
Smoked taillights (LED bulbs and sequential)
Smoked third break light (LED)

I have smoked fog lights, just no one wants to help put them in, lmao.

I'm buying a Borla ATAK catback in the next ~week or so.
So, I'll post that when it comes! ;D 




 My friend was pretty smug, always saying he was the fastest of the group, and his girlfriend even bought him 2k$ in car parts (Exhaust and a CAI), but thats all gone now, and he has to sell the car.

I'm the fastest now. B) 









 If you wanna see my friends wrecked '15... I can make you feel better... 




 Listened to you for awhile, and now you're big enough that my work plays your music.
Which is so awesome. I'm happy you've grown, you've always been an incredible artist! 




 Ayyyyye DSG 




 Really jealous of you right now. 




 Hey boss, I wasn't leaning. I was uhhh... 




 I've worked at a Sonic. This isn't a common thing. Hell, I couldn't even lean on any table. I guess it really just depends on what state you're in. The East Valley in Arizona is safe, though. 




 How many miles and the such? I got my 04 GT with 24k miles for 9 something. But then it was 2014 Winter. But still..  




 This. 




 This is not my car, it is my friends and I was a passenger at the time of the accident.

Story:
Went to go around a [Con-Way Freight truck](https://media.glassdoor.com/o/40989/con-way-freight-office.jpg), we had just turned onto a new street and were in 2nd, max speed I feel was 50, and when he turned to go into the other lane to pass, he turned too sharp and it kicked out and we went into the curb, then bounced and hit the truck and went under it a bit (rear bumper has a huge hole in it, and the c pillar is smashed and rear glass is all gone). After hitting the truck we went back into the curb and bounced over it, down a ditch and hit a tree.

I think its going to get totaled. What do you guys think?

It only had a CAI and a Cat-back. 




 9 grand for an 03 v6 :O 




 HA. 




 Rest in Peace PJ. It was hard. 




 This car was a PAVS on saturday! Really nice car. 




 Awesome! :D 




 Edit your flair. It's on the right hang side if the page! :) 




 yeah, thats what bugs me the most about this. 




 right? 




 Just leave the outside completely wrecked and make it the ultimate slow sleeper stang. Sounds like a good plan. I'd love it. 




 Jeeeeez. Just do an entire coyote swap! Hahaha, are you going to paint it the original color, or something different? 




 At least you own it man, all money goes to car parts! All my money goes to paying the bank so that one day I could own him. :( And that would be sick as fuck. 




 probably, but it's still a drawing and I still love it.

See [this](http://i.imgur.com/lGepAOD.jpg) for the updated version I had him do. 




 I see! Your flair says ugly POS. But hey, my '95 v6 was a POS, but a Mustang is a Mustang! 




 camera trick, my friend pops light whilst the camera takes continuous photos. Do that multiple times and then put it all together and theres the result! 




 [Updated, final version](http://i.imgur.com/lGepAOD.jpg) 









 It didn't like my friends '15, lol. 




 @the_mustang_artist on IG or " The Mustang Artist " on Facebook. 




 I'm having him do mine too! Can't wait! 




 OH OKAY, COME OVER 




 BUT IS THAT A GOOD IDEA? 




 I KNOW. DO YOU WANT TO PURCHASE ME SPRINGS? FOR JUST 2$ A DAY, YOU COULD HELP A 4x4 MUSTANG BECOME THE MENACING LOWERED BEAST IT ALWAYS DREAM OF BEING. 




 That stock 4x4 status, eh? I do need to lower it. 




 The friendship, then the 'stangs. ;) 









 Yeah, DSG is the best color. My friend got a Magnetic, and I like it but I LOVE DSG. If DSG was an option, I think it'd sell like hot cakes. 




 If only I was in HS back then. :( 




 I try really hard. 









 199.99! :P 




 I'm mad now. 









 Right? I hate my plate. But I ordered a new one. "04DSGGT" 




 Hell yeah! I think DSG is a great color. And no prob man! 




 2004 DSG GT Coupe with the 40th anni Package. And yourself? (Car looks awesome BTW, can't wait to do a Grille Delete.) 




 Bought new Clear Corner headlights for my baby. Also bought new taillights, third brake light, some quarter marker tint, sequential harness, and a shit ton of LEDs and bulbs.

I did buy new foglights, but I haven't installed them yet, but I plan on doing it sometime this weekend, I bought the smoked ones from AM. 









 TKO! Fucking love his car man. 




 When your girlfriend says shes home alone. 




 Would need to see it in a better picture. 




 Thats basically the dip on it right now, it's not hulk green anymore. 




 Correct. 




 Both are dipped by the same people. 




 Its a Cali special, so its a v8.
Its on bags, so she can change her ride height.
It's not cambered. 




 I like her lime green more than her hulk green, tbh. 




 S550s and 4cyl are cool in my book man. 




 Oh my bad! They put nitrogen in the tires. [This](http://www.nitrofill.com/) 




 They added in nitrogen and tint and the stripe, so I don't know how much the stripe by its self costed, but they did charge for it all. 




 I think double stripes looks amazing as while. Definitely has to be black on white. Or some bright color. And the dealer put the stripe on before he bought it,  so it was included. 




 This is what made me love New Edges, such a phat ass. Shaved rear is the best IMO. 




 Check my submit history for a picture of Magnetic with stripe(s) on it. I personally think, the stripe brings the car together. 




 Hell yeah, if I see any mustang, I try and park next to it, or as close as I can. Even if they person doesn't car about the history and community of it. 




 Ill find some owners who love to park next to me, and then I find some who just don't care and park anywhere. Then there's the ones who don't care about the community behind the car, it's just another car to them. It really is just a luck of the draw. My friend gets all the mustangs parked next to him, but that's cause he's got a 15. 




 I love my '04 GT, its fast enough and fun enough for me. 




 driven the tricycle, most fun i've had. 




 And you killed him!? God, man.. 




 I can't remember a lot of things either, Idk if it was the depression, or the amount of pills I've taken all at once. 




 Love the fog, I wish it got like that around my place! Would be sick for some photo-shoots! 




 I didn't make them, my friend came over and took 25-30ish shots of each car with different parts of the car lit up, some with headlights on, some not, some interior light pops, mostly outside light pops. Garage door open, and closed. And he just mashed them together.   Put yeah, probably Lightroom and PS. Lol 




 Thanks man! I do too. ;) 




 I think 47 MSRP is pretty fair. 60+ isn't though. 




 It is 1 of 1964 though..

But the dealer near me has one for 47k, so it's still high as fuck. 









 Yeah.... That's true... Lol
