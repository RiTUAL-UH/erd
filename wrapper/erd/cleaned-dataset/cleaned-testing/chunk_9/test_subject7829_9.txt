 The poles shift. Bigfoot gets his own reality show. The Prime Minister of Canada turns in to a werewolf on live television. Cats and dogs living together. Miley Cyrus elected to Congress. Chaos. 




 I'm not as pessimistic. This is one issue where committed liberals and conservatives are pretty much in agreement. Yes, the "mushy middle" and "think of the children" people might support forfeiture, but politicians quite often cave under pressure that comes form *both* sides of the political spectrum. For every 10 soccer moms who vaguely support forfeiture, there's two left-wing and three right-wing activists who hate it with a passion. Passion often wins out over numbers in politics.  




 Before becoming an officer you must complete extensive firearms training in terms of safety, skills and tactics in most jurisdictions. No one is issued a badge after firing 50 rounds at a range. Even probation officers who rarely carry are required to do far more training than that. 




 I doubt that's true. However I have no problem with civilians owning firearms if they pass a rigorous background check and training program first. The point of this article was that even a pro-gun group found that just a "random dude" with a weapon can't stop a massacre. Someone with proper training, either police or civilian, might have had a chance. 




 There is nothing wrong with training police in military tactics. The problem comes when untrained officers are given military-grade equipment without knowing how to use it or when it is appropriate to deploy it. 




 No, *trained* people with guns did, not amateurs. 














 That subreddit sucks, actually. It's 90% "HEY GUYZ I JUS HAD MY FIRST LUCD DREAM XDDDDD"

Plus weird taboos. There was a whole discussion about chakras and and the third eye in which even some of the mods participated, but so much as mention shared dreams or dream characters having their own personalities outside of your subconscious, and it gets deleted immediately. I fail to see how one topic is any more or less New Agey than the other. 









 Negative numbers don't get equal treatment in mathematics. "-2" really doesn't get the respect as a unitary entity like "2." Instead, it's tradition to read it as "-1*2," so when you see -2^2, the tradition is to read it as -1( 2^2 ) = -1(4) = -4.

I personally consider writing -2^2 to be "bad grammar," since its meaning isn't clear as you've demonstrated by asking this question.

If we mean to say "the square of negative 2" we should write (-2)^2, and if we mean to say "the negative of the square of 2," we should write -( 2^2 ) 




 Using combinations, since there are 13 animals total, therefore P(no cats)=P(all dogs)=(7C4)/(13C4)

So P(at least one cat) = 1- P(all dogs) = 1 - (7C4)/(13C4) = 0.9510

If you haven't learned about combinations yet, you can find P(all dogs) by doing (7/13)(6/12)(5/11)(4/10) 














   Zaman is part of the Gulen movement, whose leading figure, Fethullah Gulen has been exiled from Turkey and accused of Deep State - or State within a state - operations.

Yep. Another major activity of the Gulen movement is running privatized "charter schools" in the US with your tax dollars. They operate over 100 schools in the US, often with minimally-trained teachers brought over on work visas from Turkey. 

Turkish politics overall is terrifying. There is not one "deep state" but several and they are currently at war. I remember one twitter quote from a few months back that said "unsubscribing from Turkish politics on mental health grounds." Anyone who looks into this subject will sympathize. It is one place in the world where pulp-fiction conspiracy theories actually stand a good chance of being not only true, but understatements of what's really going on. 




 His story feeds in to the "became great with no formal training or higher education" myth that people (especially Americans) love. Except that in his case it was actually partially true. Combined with the whole "paranormal" element to his story as I mentioned above, I think this is what makes him a popular favorite more than any "exoticization." 




 I am confused, what does this list have to do with Ramanujan? 




 I am surprised with all the awful "paranormal" TV shows around these days that there is not one that has devoted an episode to Ramanujan, as far as I know: *I'm not saying it was psychic communication with a Hindu goddess, but...* 









 This pasty white redditor who grew up in an all white suburb but then lived in iffy urban neighborhoods and then a suburban apartment complex with a lot of Section 8 housing for several years can tell you he's pretty much correct. 




 You make some good points, but as other readers have pointed out, Japan was prosperous when the Yen was less than half its current value versus the dollar. The CB has a lot of room to run before it encounters depreciation issues. 




 Japan was forced into the Plaza Accords, otherwise Reagan was going to give in to Protectionist pressure and limit auto and steel imports. The inflation and bursting of the real estate bubble did more damage to Japan than Plaza. 




 When that someone is the Central Bank of your own country, you don't really have any worries in that regard. Japan's economic problems come from epic mal-investment due to the all-powerful construction lobby and make-workism, not from a lack of demand for government debt. 
























 By the time the bubble burst in 2008, the banks had a gun to the whole world's head, and our only choice was to either bail out the fraudulent bastards or suffer global depression and war that might have killed a couple of billion.

Or, you know, a rational restructuring that would have given equity rights to bondholders. A lot less dramatic than a nuclear holocaust, I admit, but far more sensible. Sheer corruption prevented this remedy, not the risk of atomic warfare. 














 There is the issue of information transparency, in that the Mexican consumers did not know that they were getting US goods instead of Mexican ones. The farmers in general did not want to leave their land.

[Here is a good summary of the impact of NAFTA on Mexico] (http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/11/24/what-weve-learned-from-nafta/under-nafta-mexico-suffered-and-the-united-states-felt-its-pain) 




 More like they are under a lot of pressure to pass kids who have a minimal level of knowledge or effort. 




 If I am ever in charge of a school, I would immediately ban crosswords, word bubble searches, coloring-in maps and PowerPoint "presentations" that are 90% pictures as homework assignments in high school. It is astounding how meaningless these assignments are - and how long they take. I hated them in school and thought they were on their way out (well besides the PowerPoint stuff). 

Sadly, as a teacher 10 years later I see they are just as prevalent as ever, if not more so. 




 I guess it depends on whether or not you think 20% of a country having their way of life destroyed overnight and being forced into factory work is worth the other 80% having marginally cheaper food (in a country with a huge obesity problem already.) 




 Trying to limit trade will only decrease the tariff revenue. 

Tarriffs impose an inherent limit on trade by raising the price of foreign goods as opposed to domestic goods. There are more marginal domestic producers in the market with a higher tariff than a lower one.

ut if you're trying to put more limits and regulations on trade that will actually be a bad thing.

The only regulatory limits to trade I support would be ones outlawing child labor or slave labor conditions, and egregious environmental pollution by the importing country. Supposedly the new trade agreements being negotiated have these regulations, but I'll believe it when I see it (and see it enforced.) 




 In the bizarro world of the inner city, a lot people make this choice for real (not endorsing it, just pointing that out.) 




  Completely orthogonal issues. You can have trade and free education if you want.

I don't think that they are. A badly regulated free trade regime makes it much easier to avoid taxes, starving the state of revenue that might have otherwise gone towards education health. 









 A subsistence farmer relies on his own crop for food, that doesn't mean he (or she) doesn't sell any of it. Even subsistence farmers need to sell some crops to buy fertilizer, pay rent if they are tenants, and buy equipment. Often they "pay in kind" for these items which means they pay in crop, but if the price of the crop decreases they can buy less than they used to, and may be and in Mexico often were forced off the land. 




 products get cheaper, that means that the people who live in the US can buy more.

Not if more of their income is taken up with essentials such as food, energy, education and health care which is what has happened. 




 [I thought this was parody... I guess not for everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QDv4sYwjO0) 




 I still don't see how the examples you cite show how the median household in the US has benefited more from globalization in the form of lower consumer goods prices than it has been hurt by it in terms of lower wages, higher food and gas prices and much greater job insecurity. 

Rice and sunflowers? Those are niche products. Let's talk steel, textiles, tire and rubber manufacturing, electronics, all of which were once mass employers in the US but are now mostly gone.  




 Having had success with Monster, is there any way to distinguish the genuine job offers from the spam? That is the main complaint I hear about Monster, that 90% + of the postings are not legit. 

When I used it in my job searches I had zero success. I had one callback, from a company that claimed to be Citigroup but was not Citigroup (instead it was a franchisee that had the right to use the Citigroup name for its financial advisory business), offering a job with no salary, only commission, when the posting gave a salary. From what I hear my experience is fairly typical of Monster. 




 Good things tend to come with some uglies, but there is no reason to throw out the baby with the bathwater.

Agreed, but pour in too much water too quickly, and you don't wash the baby, you drown it. 




 Spengler was a pessimist like Schopenhauer who thought European civilization was ultimately doomed. He's part of the romantic Western tradition of the glorious loser who cannot prevail but fights on anyway because he is spiritually superior even if physically weaker. Once you're aware of this trope you see it everywhere in Western culture, from the religion of the Norse to Rorke's Drift to the Alamo. This attitude comes from the long history of Europe being less developed and less populous than the great Eastern Empires, and always in fear of being overwhelmed by them (especially the Mongols and the Ottomans.)

But like Schopenhauer who inspired a Nietzsche who was willing to "fight to win,"  Spengler has legions of fans in the fascist and far-right worlds who accept his diagnosis of history but not his prognosis. In my view Spengler has now become part of the "rhetoric of decline" that is used to justify right-wing views (our society is corrupt and decadent, it must become more disciplined because a big fight is combing with those other guys who don't look like us, etc.). 
 




  You are speaking as if free trade was literally sustained by violence 

The sad fact is that this is often the case, from political repression in China to assassination of union officials in South America, to cocoa plantation slavery in Africa.

 




 It's been around for a while, but one of the sides of the "dual" being conservative Christians is relatively new. The studios saw the pile of cash ol' Mel made with the Passion of the Christ and decided to get in on the game. 




 I would imagine a conversion, false or not, might stop such a person from torturing. Certainly this is what jihadists do. One of the reason ISIS is rejected even by other extreme groups like Al Qaeda is they have executed people even after forced conversions to Islam. 




 Also subsistence farmers are 1 draught away from famine, so it's not like it's all roses.

Somewhat of a myth, at least in Mexico. Africa that might be closer to the truth. There is (or was) enough community/state support in Mexico to counteract famines. 

the borders may be a sad necessity in terms of order but it doesn't follow that arbitrary trade restrictions need to be bundled with it. 

Not arbitrary. I do favor the gradual lowering of tariffs and immigration restrictions over time, but do it too fast and you risk a political backlash, economic panic, and collapse of the integration project.

If restricting speech and banning certain kinds of porn by people who claim control over pieces of land is considered bad, why is restricting/banning certain products good?

If you want to go with a porn analogy, right now we are allowing abusive porn where it is obvious that the women (workers) are being exploited/raped but we (investor class) get so much pleasure (profit) from it that we look the other way.

Full open borders would be like legalizing child porn and would be a moral and political disaster. 




 Almost all cars are made in high-wage countries (US, Germany, Japan). I fail to see the parallel. 




 Cheap gadgets is not real prosperity. A lot of families would trade in their computers and cell-phones in an instant if they could have affordable health care and college education again.

I agree that the billion people lifted out of poverty is a very good thing, but trade integration is happening way too fast. A neo-fascist actually has a good chance of getting elected President of France. Genuine Nazis sit in the Greek parliament and the Greek elections might lead to a radical left-wing government that has promised to cut Greece off from the global trade and finance system.

Yes these are extreme cases but they are also canaries in the coal mine. If there is another crash like 2008 we could see similar things in the US and that would make all the progress we've seen for naught. A Buchananite or far-left political party arising in the US if there is more economic chaos and inequality is not out of the question. 




 Cool, please share this with TracyMorganFreeman 




 why are you hating on poor people who would spend decades longer working in subsistence farming and in hardcore sweatshops? 

No hate towards the sweatshop workers, but the subsistence farmers who are often forced off their land into sweatshops by free-trade deals that dump subsidized US agriculture products in their country might not agree that free trade helped them all that much.

In fact from purely utilitarian perspective it's better to lift billions from true poverty than to spare millions of special snowflakes some hardship.

I agree, but free trade doesn't always do that (Mexico is the country I had in mind above), and even when it does (such as China) if the disruption is such that it imperils economic integration through the rise of nationalism and ideological as opposed to pragmatic (and phased-out) protectionism then in the long run it is counter-productive.

Without lines of the map and people enforcing bans on shit, free trade would be a default state of the affairs.

Without those lines on a map, total chaos would be the state of world affairs. If you really want to see a race war, declare open borders tomorrow. I want to abolish those lines too, but it has to be done slowly. The past thirty years has seen this process proceed too fast, and it risks a big crash that will set humanity back. 




 Depends on who you believe and how you interpret certain passages. However, hell as a place of eternal torment is what most conservative US Christians believe, so that is what matters pertaining to my question, the cultural assumption, not what's actually in the Bible. 




 I fear your "proportionate to interest and ability" is merely a charitable perception of Title IX you've been led to believe, and not its wording or what the HEW's interpretation of it is.

Perhaps so, though I think that's what the third prong says. Like I said, time for an expert opinion. Knowing lawyers, they will probably disagree on the interpretation just like we have but it's worth a shot.
 




 Well maybe we can get AskLawyers or something to weigh in on this because we're obviously not getting anywhere with this discussion because we don't agree on what "proportionate to interest and ability" means. I don't think the law operates the way you think it does but make a post on there and see what the experts say. 




 The recent torture scandal has me wondering how much of our acceptance of torture comes from having a mainly Christian religious background in the US. At first glance, torture would seem to be very un-Christian, love your enemies and all that, but what else is Hell but eternal torture for "bad guys"? 

And if torture is something that God does, can a Christian say that it is categorically bad? And if a Christian meets someone (say a terrorist), that he is sure is going to hell, what's wrong with giving that terrorist a little foretaste of what he has coming to him, especially if you might also get some useful information?

Obviously this critique applies to all religions that believe in a hell, not just Christians. 




 If all you're able to show is that the average female athlete gets 10% more scholarship money than the average male athlete, I hardly think that's an injustice worthy of such outrage. Yes it should be equal not 10% more for women but that's no reason to get rid of Title IX.

You should read your own link: Schools are in compliance with Title IX if they meet *any* of the three prongs, whereas you are arguing as if they have to meet *all* of them.

Also an interesting tidbit in the article: Title IX has been used, though rarely, to increase the number of male sports or to give more funding to male sports as in the Kentucky case. 

No they don't. Further the NFL does not do that at all; you're referring to a particular source of revenue that is shared among them; it's not the case for ALL revenue.

Nor is it for college athletics under Title IX. The salaries of the football coaches alone often equal the entire budget for female sports. 

I'm not as equally productive as you. Paying me like I am doesn't prove that.

No, but nor are women's sports "paid" equally to men's. Only the *opportunities for participation* (proportionate to interest) must be funded equally. Like I said at some schools the football team alone is more than half the budget. If Title IX really meant an equal division of revenue, that would be illegal. 




  I spent under 5 minutes searching a single job site (monster.com) for the man's chosen title. After culling unrelated jobs I came up with 10 jobs within 50 miles posted in the last few weeks.

How many are spam postings that a company is required to post either because of internal policy or federal regulations? In the case of the former, the job has already been "filled" by an insider but they have to go through the charade of a public posting, in the case of the latter, it is usually so they can qualify to bring in a foreign worker under H1B or another visa program.

I don't know anyone who got a job through Monster, do you? 




 Hollywood has been doing the "dual marketing" thing lately, where they market the same movie as an action-adventure to mainstream audiences and as an explicitly religious film to evangelical groups. It has led to a bunch of Bible-movie stinkers in recent years (Noah, anyone?) because they have to appeal to both groups, kind of like those bland romantic comedies with some gross-out humor thrown in to get single men into theaters.

The success of a rather mediocre band called "Creed" comes to mind as a similar example from the music world. 




 but why would the third world slow down its economic development so the feelings of the well off west are not upset?

They wouldn't have a choice. Growth in third-world economies could have been constrained by a tariff system geared to some level of continuing median wage growth in the rich world. Tariffs could have gradually been brought down to converge the wage lines so that both still sloped upwards instead of the current race to the bottom. 

Free trade agreements and open borders aren't a force of nature like electricity, they're a conscious policy decision. People are waking up to the reality that the impoverishment of middle America was not some kind of inevitable process. It was the direct (if perhaps unintended) result of government policies or lack thereof. 
 




 Equitably to them meaning either similar portions of either sex, or women guaranteed their interests met but men not provided that same guarantee, which means only thinking of one sex, which isn't equitable.

Women are not guaranteed anything under Title IX except that *if* they are interested and *if* male sports are also funded, then female sports must be funded equitably. 

Disallowing the same rate of expansion that females have by mandating women's interests be met first

There is nothing in Title IX that says women's needs must be met first, only that they must be met concomitantly. 

If you need special inducement-which by virtue of getting disproportionately more funding as I showed earlier-then you don't prove equal interest.

You did not show disproportionate funding, nor does Title IX require that. In fact quite the opposite.

Division I football is a huge revenue source

Right, and nothing in Title IX prevents head football coaches from being paid for a single game more than a lot of coaches of female sports will make in 10 years. Nothing in Title IX would prevent a school from taking all that money and using it to build a science lab either. All it says is that if that money is going to be put back into athletics, it must fund male and female sports equally if there is equal interest and ability.

I tell you what. Let's start a business, and as a rule no matter who works more or sells more, at the end of the day we'll split the profits 50/50. 

Sounds good to me. Lots of law firms operate like that - as does (gasp!) the NFL, the biggest and malest sports league of them all.

 




  I disagree that the law is a quota, because quotas mandate percents and Title IX does not, but that comes down to semantics. You don't have to fund *any* sports under Title IX, but if you do, you must fund them equitably. 

There has been a huge increase in female athletics at all levels since Title IX (with no concomitant decrease in male participation by the way) which makes me think that millions of girls enjoy and take athletics just as seriously as any boy.

Look at viewership, participation, and funding of athletics outside the education system. People by and large value male athletics more.

When athletics is part of the educational process, the number of *spectators* is irrelevant, just as the number of people who watch the Math Olympiad vs. a Shakespeare play says nothing about how math classes should or should not be funded compared to English classes. 




 If you read the article carefully, he is staying in the union so that he has a shot at a pension, not out of some "brotherhood" thing. 




 Actually yes it still can be. If your quota for hiring is "X% of employees must be female unless none apply", it's still a quota.

Not really. It would only be a quota if there were mixed teams, but with separate male and female leagues for everything but ping pong, you can't call that a quota. It just says you have to fund male and female teams equally.

Well if you cut a female team you're not longer in compliance

If you cut *just* a female team, you're no longer in compliance. But if you cut one of each you're still in compliance. Title IX just keeps athletic directors from *targeting* female teams for cuts because of the perception that women's sports aren't as "serious" as men's.  




 Looking at the numerous sports leagues that don't rely on funding enforced by Title IX suggests otherwise. Title IX's quota mechanisms masks male interest.

You have not shown a single quota in Title IX - because there aren't any. A school where girls just don't want to do sports could have zero female sports teams and still be in compliance with Title IX. That's not a quota system.

And when budget cuts happen in athletics departments, they can't cut female teams. 

I see nothing in the law that precludes cutting female teams for budgetary (as opposed to exclusionary) reasons. In the past female teams could be cut in tight budget times because "girls don't really need sports" or some such sexist rationale. Now there needs to be equitable treatment which I feel is a good thing. 




 "Responsive to interests and abilities" means that females at a school have to show an interest in athletics and ability to take part before Title IX kicks in, which is just what I have been saying. The huge increase in female participation in sports since Title IX shows that this interest is there. I would not say that males are vastly more interested in sports - watching sports, maybe, but not playing them. 

This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution is meeting the interests and abilities of its female students even where there are disproportionately fewer females than males participating in sports.

This means a school is in compliance with Title IX even if they have more men than women in sports as long as those women who are interested and able can participate. 




 Please show me where in Title IX these requirements exist, I have not heard of the law being implemented or interpreted in this way. From what I know funding is on a per participant basis, not a pre-set quota. 




 Like I said, I don't think Title IX works that way. It simply says that if girls *want* to play sports, their teams must be funded out of the same pot as boys' teams, not that at a school with 10 male teams and 1 female team, that the female team gets half the money. If that were true it would be illegal for all-male schools to have sports and they obviously do. 




 All of that might be true, but it doesn't explain why this would cause a stock market crash. Why should a fall in the oil price mean that companies overall are less valuable? Aren't cheaper resources good for the economy as a whole, leaving long-term environmental issues aside? 




 If that is true I agree, but to the best of my knowledge Title IX only requires equitable funding *per student*, not that if a school spends $x on athletics, that "x" must be split evenly between men's and women's sports.  









 They may not be allowed, but when has that stopped anyone from doing anything, ever?

I don't know, maybe the chief saying "where's car 6?" and the reply being "Barry took it to Vegas for the weekend" isn't a good way to keep your job. 




 Probably not DDT since it's still such a notorious chemical, but there are plenty of EPA and OSHA regs ignored by companies in states like Texas. Especially if they are small they figure the Feds don't have the resources to come after them and the state does not have specific laws against what they are doing. 




 It does mean that if there are female sports teams, mens teams get cut, and since not all sports require the same kind of equipment, it doesn't equal out like people expect.

Big equipment costs relative to other sports are really only an issue in football as far as I know, and most football teams have active booster clubs that take care of a lot of these costs. I have not heard of any school cutting football because of Title IX. 




 The manager is afraid that the high-skill person will leave after a couple of months for cleaner, better work. 

Or take his job. Or report him for a labor violation like overtime laws that his other employees are too ignorant to even realize exists. 




  Why are the people in the first world countries entitled to a better living standard?

We're not, and as far as trade improves the median well-being in the world, I am for it, but a decline in rich-country living standards imperils the political stability of those countries that are crucial to the political stability of the world as a whole (and imperils the whole free-trade project to boot.) 

It's stupid policy in the long run. Third-world wages could still have been increased in a more gradual way to converge with those of the first-world without causing an absolute decline in first-world living standards. 




  Title IX legislation that functions in reducing boys sports teams when not enough girls are interested to form a girls one

That's not how Title IX works, it simply guarantees equal funding per student for male and female sports. It doesn't mean that the football team gets no money because there's no girls' football team.

synthetic phonics yield better results for both boys and girls than analytic(suggesting that those pushing for it merely wish for girls to outperform boys than optimizing education for children in general).

That's the first phonics-based conspiracy theory I've ever heard. I hope it is also the last.
 




 GDP per capita in 2009 was $600, one of the lowest in the world. No accurate data available after 2009, as the country slid into utter chaos (aside from a few bits that managed to break away Kurdistan-style.) Funny definition of "healthy" from our buds at the CIA. 




 Nowhere in my post did I even mention government intervention to fix this problem

Or maybe we could talk about how we handle post secondary education in this country?

I hate to tell you, reforming that sector's giant debt drag on the economy will require massive government intervention, even though it was stupid government intervention (loan subsidies without price controls) that helped to create the mess in the first place. 









 Maybe, but cops on duty are rarely in a rush to get anywhere unless on a call. Remember, they're at work, on patrol. They get to the end of the patrol circuit all they do is turn around and start again. Unless it's a very small town, it's very unlikely that they're allowed to use a patrol car as a personal vehicle when not on duty. 




 And FOP licesnse plates/stickers = no tickets. I am one of the rare pro-cop liberals around these days, but that is one that has always bothered me. Some cops (especially state cops) don't like it either and may even go out of their way to pull over cars with FOP tags, especially if it looks like it's "just" a family member trying to use the plates to get away with reckless driving, 




  Of all crimes in the USA, armed bank robbery has the highest conviction rate... At 60%. Crime doesn't pay? For 40% of bank robbers, it does. 

Unless they take enough to set themselves up for life, they're going to have to keep robbing banks. Chances of pulling off just 5 robberies without getting caught at a 40% individual success rate is just 1%. Most bank robbers are desperate drug addicts or people with a debt to organized crime and are quickly caught. There are a few exceptions (like the North Hollywood shootings) where an organized gang still attempts a bank robbery Bonnie and Clyde style, but those days are mostly gone. In the era of swipe cards the amount of physical cash at banks isn't that high anymore. A lot of the more knowledgeable robbers go after the safe deposit boxes and try to break in after hours. 




 The smart ones are in Congress. 




  I see at least once a month- a cop with NO lights on and NO siren speeding 20+ over- a huge safety hazard for all other vehicles on the road. 

This means they're on a stealth call or pursuit and have been ordered to approach with lights and siren off so that whoever they're after doesn't get tipped off.

And don't say "could've been thru the light for a call" no he pulled in to Burger King.

Did he go to the drive-thru? Otherwise that could have been a call. Lots of drama goes down at BK, Wal-Mart, etc. 









 The comments on the NYT site give some very good reasons why people don't do this.

[I've summarized some of them in another comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/2p3d0q/the_vanishing_male_worker/cmtbb90) 




 We probably don't agree much on politics I'm guessing, but you make some very good points about the counter-productivity of *means-tested* benefits, ones the article and the comments on the NYT site also touch on, namely:

1.) Child care + cost of car + commuting would cost more than many of these low-wage jobs pay. 

2.) "Job lock" syndrome where taking a low-paying job makes employers in your former industry far less likely to hire you, and also severely cuts down on your time to search for a job (witness the one guy who was fired for asking for a single day off to care for his dying mother.), and, if you get fired again, the fact that you had a low-wage job even for one day can reduce or even eliminate your unemployment benefits (I know this is true in Michigan.)

3.) "Abuse" of the welfare system by people making phony disability claims. The fact that SDI is welfare for white people is an open secret in Washington. There are counties in West Virgina and Kentucky where almost half of households get the majority of their income from SDI. You never hear the GOP screaming about cutting SDI, and for good reason, it's their most loyal voters who are on it. I know a woman who gets physically disgusted whenever someone so much as mentions Obama, and yet has been on SDI since 9/11 for "psychological trauma" from the event (she did work in New York, but not in the immediate vicinity of the Twin Towers). She uses her income in a so-far futile attempt to launch a singing career.

My solution would be to have a *universal* Basic Income and a *universal* health program and child care, this removing the economic dis-incentive to work that many of these men face, rather than just slashing these programs which will probably only increase the social destruction.

Fat chance of that happening in the current political environment, but one can dream. 









 The Christianization of the Viking kingdoms coincided with the end of the raiding period, but more than that I do not know. The pagan Viking religion emphasized strength and cunning, so I doubt that there were many moral qualms about raiding prior to the coming of Christianity.  














 I've never heard that way of explaining it before - I like it! I know that "rifleman" implies function (rifles only fire one projectile at a time), but you might want to make that clear to the OP.

Come to think of it, we can extend this metaphor and say that in non-function mappings at least one shooter has a shotgun instead of a rifle.

 




 This is more like the Franklin Affair in the US then the Satanic Panic. Shady, shady shit that was never fully investigated. It might have been delusional people making up stories, or it might have been that some very powerful people were pedophiles and murderers. In the UK you also have the Libel Laws where journalists are guilty until proven innocent (opposite of US) which could explain the very careful and low-key nature of the reporting on this. 




  Putting downward pressure on mortgage rates helps regular folks. 

Only those that already own homes and can trade on that equity, assuming that any gains they get from that aren't outweighed by the negative effects of financial repression on other forms of investment.

Any decrease in the interest rate just drives up (or maintains artificially high) real estate prices. QE is welfare for both the rich and the property-owning upper-middle class and unfortunately it has become the primary welfare channel in recent years. It is far from an ideal way to to help the real economy and has a ton of negative side effects. 




 I will agree with you as far as the treasuries go, but for the MBS side I really do see QE as fundamentally different - in my mind it's the difference between purchasing healthy cows for more than their milk is worth and purchasing potentially sick cows that give toxic milk (thereby encouraging the issuance of more sick cows - bad mortgages.) Both are bad, but one is far worse. 




 I think we're at the semantic lower bound of this argument. 




 It is a giveaway to banks greater in scale and different in kind than previous giveaways. Whether you call that "special" or not is up to you. 




 It is not special in terms of the monopoly aspect. It is special in that for the first time the Fed is acting as a purchaser of non-government assets and has circumvented the zero-interest constraint on monetary policy, allowing for a far more massive intervention in the markets than ever before. 




  Interest is a policy variable and doesn't have a natural rate.

So there were no interest rates before the government started setting them? Please... 




  Sure smells Ron Paulish in here right now.

I think you are confusing Paul's perfume with that emanating from us who want *fiscal* stimulus that supports median income, not *monetary* stimulus that, while staving off another crash, really only improves things for those who already own a lot of financial assets. 




 Its always Fed policy. That's how the system works.

QE is not always Fed policy. I have my issues with "normal" Fed policy also, but QE is something we haven't seen since the 30's, and never on this scale. 




  But you can't then argue that the public is getting screwed when they can purchase for the same price.

Yes, the public still is screwed because the price is higher than it should be. My (saved) dollar that I earned through actual economic activity can't earn its natural rate of interest as a result. It's called [Financial Repression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_repression). 




  The Fed announced that they will spend $1,000 on cows every month. Every month, an auction is held, and the Fed buys $1,000 worth of cow from whoever highs the lowest price in the auction.

And if there are not $1,000 worth of cows out there, sick ones still get bought. The mere fact that the Fed is in these auctions means the natural demand is not there, implying the assets don't really have these values. 




 In any circumstance, it wasn't the bulk of the purchases

37.5% of a multi-trillion dollar program is big enough to be considered bulk in my book.

As long as the values track over the life of the bond, who cares?

Because if this happens it is only because of Fed policy, not because of actual demand for the asset.
 




 So when the Fed can put any value it wants on a financial asset, the meaning of an "equal-valued" swap is not the same as if these prices were solely determined by market forces. 

To dredge up an old analogy from the 2008 crash, if I owned some sick cows and the Fed announced that it would give me a healthy cow for every sick cow I handed over to them, that would be an equal-valued swap in your book, because I could also sell my sick cows to other institutions on the open market for a healthy cow, since those other institutions know they could turn their sick cows in to the Fed for a healthy one. 




  It means that other institutions purchased it at the same price.

Based on the expectations these institutions had about Fed policy... Surely you know that when the Fed announces that it will purchase Asset X at Price Y, the price quite often automatically adjusts to Y and the Fed ends up not actually making any purchases at all. 




 Only the first mortgage purchases can be argued to be this, but I've seen no evidence to back your position

That's why I said "who knows what" quality. I have my suspicions but due to lack of transparency in these financial instruments we will probably never know.

 They traded an interest bearing dollar for an interest bearing reserve.

They traded a bond with a fixed payment structure for a demand deposit. These are not the same thing even if they both bear interest. You can't argue they have "equal value" when the "value" on one side of the transaction can be arbitrarily determined by the Fed's authority. 




 So as you can see from your chart, QE was mostly treasuries.

Yes, but also almost 40% mortgage-backed stuff of who knows what quality...

It was a dollar of reserves for a dollar of bonds. Its a swap, like four quarters for a dollar.

What defines a "dollar" of bonds, their current market value or their face value? Only if it is the latter do you have an argument that it is a swap, and even then not really because the sellers in QE traded a future dollar for a present dollar. 




 QE did not just buy treasuries, it bought mortgage-backed securities as well. As for the treasuries, their value is determined by demand for them which while QE was underway was determined by the Fed. You can't say it was a swap for equal value when the Fed could put any value on the treasuries that it wanted.

[Here is a chart from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing#mediaviewer/File:U.S._Federal_Reserve_-_Treasury_and_Mortgage-Backed_Securities_Held.png) 




 I got an unexplained $700 check of "helicopter money" from the government in either late 2006 or early 2007 - labelled as an advance on future tax rebates or something like that to keep things legit. 

I think the majority of Americans got between $400-800 in that early stimulus from Bush, which was arguably more "socialist" than any of Obama's policies. 




  Its not free. QE was an asset swap of equal valued assets.

Equal-valued like all the supposedly safe AAA-rated CDO's that were bought with the bailout money? I doubt the swaps were really equal valued assets. I agree with Krugman on some points, but QE was a continuation of the bailout by other means. 

I think he knows that, but does not want to criticize the "only game left in town," even if it worsens inequality, since it is the only thing left propping up the economy. 









  I suddenly started getting lots of scary visual images of a woman with a monstrous face saying she is going to eat my soul :(. 

If you are a traditionalist, that would be a manifestation of Mara, the demonic power in Buddhism, trying to impede your progress. But yeah, I would just stay away from nosleep. 




 You seem to be right, it has dropped recently (though is still very high by European standards and is above the US native birthrate.) 




 And the reverse tragedy too: Too many are forced into higher education who don't really want or need it but see no other way to get beyond the McJobs level due to a lack of apprenticeship and training programs. 




  I'm not going to rush out to have a child, a life impacting decision, because the government's willing to write me a check. 

Maybe not, but it might convince people on the fence, especially if there are strong services as well. The only European country to have an above-replacement native birthrate is France, and no surprise France also has basically free childcare. (This is not an endorsement of French economic policy in general, just saying they have it right in this particular area.) 




  Fewer people equals more resources per person. ipso facto.

Not really. Fewer people decreases the supply of labor, which is definitely a resource, and, depending on the type of immigration, of technical skills and innovation as well. If you are bringing in more working-age people which increases the worker:dependent ratio, the supply of labor/skills/innovation per person will increase.

I am anti-H1B because it is exploitative to the immigrants themselves and unfair to American workers who paid for their higher education (as opposed to countries where it is state-funded), but your argument isn't very good. 




 The savings will go to the shareholders as increased profit.

To the company acting as the supposed agent of shareholders, to be more accurate. And considering that Apple is already sitting on a huge pile of cash, it will flow right into one of the biggest "dead zones" of wealth out there instead of continuing to circulate in the real economy. 




 Only half of STEM majors work in their field - they may not be unemployed, but they are underemployed. Granted, not all STEM grads are engineers.

Also, sometimes the unemployment rate for engineers is calculated using only *certified* engineers. This is a selection bias because most engineering grads don't bother to get certified until they get a job (certification is time-consuming and expensive.) It's not like teaching where you need to be certified *before* you start work. 




 He willingly conflates the quantum mechanical definition of the "void" with physical laws and probability distributions already baked in with the philosophical definition of pure nothingness (which implies a state with no physical laws), and when called on that conflation, he responds that philosophers are not qualified to talk about physics. That seems pretty arrogant to me. 

It's a shame because I used to admire him, but recently he's been adopting some really extreme positions - I think because his religious debate opponents have scored some points off him on the old "ex nihilo" debate.  




  I mean, when you combine super easy money with cheap oil it really ought to lead to increased economic activity.

Unless of course you massively raise consumer taxes at the same time... 




 He claims to have answered the Ultimate Question, but when you read the book he wrote about it... not so much. His theory is pretty much the same as the one in this article - it presupposes certain laws of physics that logically precede spacetime. 




 Assuming something cannot spring from nothing by definition, then 'something' always must have existed.

I would not assume that by definition. I actually think the eventual philosophical answer, if we ever find it, will be similar to the physical answer, that is, that nothingness is somehow unstable/impossible, and the logical fact of that is synonymous with what we mark as the first moment of time, whether that was the Big Bang or something further back. I don't find it tenable to hold that something has always existed. 




 I would disagree. Even if we accept the cosmos as eternal/infinite (which I don't, due to problems with Actual Infinities), there still remains the question as to why that state of affairs pertains instead of others.

If by "level IV" multiverse you mean ontological maximalism, the idea that all possible universes exist, that has numerous difficulties besides that of onotgeny.
 




 The theory tries to show how spacetime itself can arise from quantum mechanics, which is fascinating from the standpoint of advancing knowledge in physics, but doesn't explain how the laws were established to begin with (the philosophical issue.) 




 ontology = the nature of being

ontogony = the origin of being 




 So according to this chart a Lithium-6 fission reactor would be theoretically possible? (though obviously not practical.) 




 This "nothing" already has the laws of quantum mechanics baked in - it might explain why the physical universe came in to being, but not why it was preceded (logically if not temporally) by these laws.

The theory in this article has little or nothing to contribute to the philosophical debate on fundamental ontogeny, unfortunately. 














 Well, that's what the Mormons believe...  




  it makes a lot more sense for their to be consciousness first and a universe created from it

I agree, but...

instead of a universe spontaneously creating conscious beings through a series of evolutionary missteps.

Both of these propositions could be true, they don't necessarily conflict. The Universe could be the product of a primordial consciousness, and our own consciousnesses could indeed be simply the products of evolution.

The interesting question is - why would the primordial consciousness generate thought-forms in which material simulacrums of itself come into being? 














 Pretty thin comfort. 




 Good. The cyber schools in my state (main company owned by a brother of the state senator who pushed the bill legalizing them) have curriculum so bad that I couldn't have written it worse if I'd tried. 




 But the relative cost of a mortgage only goes down *for you* if you experience wage gains that exceed the inflation rate. 














  The people in this riot are not the forefathers of the people that live in Istanbul right now. 

Actually they most likely were. The Turks didn't just kill everyone in the Byzantine Empire when they conquered it. They interbred with the local population like most conquerors. More than one historian has pointed out that Constantinople/Istanbul has always been an unusually riotous city, right down to the present day.  




 And how do you know that Justinian didn't kill one trillion people? You weren't there, man. 




 Neat, I was unfamiliar with that notation - thanks for sharing! 




 I think you are right there is some ambiguity in what the sign means. It can mean "is not an identity," for example you could say a^b  b^a without raising any eyebrows, even though that statement is false when a = 2 and b = 4, for example.

On the other hand, a statement such as x  x + 2 is always true, and would seem to employ a stricter meaning of the  . I think you are on to something that the way to avoid this ambiguity is with logical quantifiers:

 a,b such that a^b  b^a is always true, but it is a much weaker statement. The original statement isn't just true for some values of a and b, it is true for almost all values of a and b.

x, xx+2, on the other hand, doesn't seem to lose any of the strength of the original statement.

I wonder if there is an extended logic system with a symbol for "almost all." Someone wandering by these parts will probably know. 




  Is below-target inflation good for the poor? 

Yes it is. When you don't have any assets that tend to move with inflation, and food and gas are major expenses, inflation is a killer. 














 There are a lot of conflicting interpretations of mahaparinirvana. It's curious that animuseternal identifies himself as Mahayana, as the interpretation he gives of "final extinction" is certainly not what is found in the Mahayana Parinirvana Sutra, which you should read if you are interested in this subject. The Wikipedia article isn't that bad of an introduction and there are some good sources to explore further from there.
 









 There is a sad background to this quote - everyone in his family had died very young, like barely into their 50's. Mickey assumed it would be the same for him and as a result didn't restrain his drinking and partying. 




 parameters? 




 Classism?
 




 Doesn't work that way for me, for some reason. 




 I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed this. In lucid dreams I've always been tempted to touch or smell things and I'm always amazed at how "real" they seem, but unfortunately engaging more senses seems to make the dream dissolve.

Last night I had a good (if boring) lucid dream going where I was walking through a forest. I resisted the temptation to touch or smell anything and I noticed no dissolution setting in. Then, to experiment, I touched a birch tree and almost immediately woke up.

Has anyone else experienced this, and if so, have you found a way around it? I'd love to be able to do more than just look at stuff. 









 Or Fulton Street - going back there now and seeing upscale suburban mall style stores mixed in with the old used clothing and sneaker shops that are still around is surreal. 




 I think Lonelobo was referring to his blanket dismissal of all philosophy and metaphysics as useless or nonsense after being criticized for his "universe from nothing" views and not really having a good response to the point that presupposing the laws of physics is not "nothing" in the philosophical sense. Rather than responding with a real rebuttal he basically said philosophers are not physicists and should not be able to comment on cosmology - which is what got him called anti-intellectual by a lot of people. 




 Dune 84 is one of my all-time favorite films, I cannot understand the hate for it either, or why Lynch had his name removed as director. No, it does not do the book justice, but even a ten-hour movie could not do that. It is a different vision of the story and it is spectacular. I think the sheer weirdness puts some people off, but to me it is original, bold and peerless. No movie even remotely like it has been made since. 




 I hear it more in the opposite context, when someone is describing something new. For example, I know a "nature guide" who uses it a lot to describe animals or animal behaviors that his audience is not familiar with. 




 I would agree. It is definitely more rare in the city, but it's not particularly southern. Rural men tend to use it the most. 




 I've never come across a good explanation of this, or even what the phenomenon is called, but I hear it all the time in casual speech, especially when an "expert" is addressing an audience. For example, on a nature show, the host might say "That's your yellow-bellied sap-sucker" instead of "that's a yellow-bellied sap-sucker," or a political radio host might say "That's your Republicans, always saying [whatever]"

Does anybody know a name for this and how it might have developed? 









 If they asked you to use binomial, and then said you are drawing without replacement, that is a mistake. The proper distribution to use would be hypergeometric. Do you have a copy of the test with the exact wording? 









 It's gotten some negative reviews (including on this sub), but I found [Eyes of the Mothman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fmkz_RrQxU) to be quite good (age restricted sign-in required.) 




 I figured it had something to do with "e," and this explains why wolfram couldn't find a max when clearly it never got bigger than 1.4 something - thanks! 




 A question I am curious about... 




 Yep. Same reason China sees Tiawan as a threat. They can't use the "Chinese culture and democracy are not compatible" argument nearly as easily when a counterexample is starting them in the face. 









 I think in this sort of situation exceptions would be made. We saw how fast the government invented "emergency" powers out of thin air during the financial crisis. It would be even more inventive in the case where the President was killed by his own VP. 
























 Weird... so he placed a paragraph by a fictional character he created in one of his other books, and didn't explain it? That would clear up why I can't find references to this person, but that's bizarre.

Edit: Actually, it says "a novelist" called a character "based on him" Emery Heywood, not as I first read your response to imply, that De Voto himself wrote the novel. Still this is intriguing and that result did not show up in my original search. Thanks!! 




 I saw that result in my previous search. I am sure it is a reference to the same person. I am not inclined to buy this book though just to see the footnote, because I am 99% certain it will just be a reference back to the Course of Empire. 









 Yep, nothing except links to the book itself (which tells me nothing about who he was.) 




 In the introduction to de Voto's "The Course of Empire," there is a very strange and poetic paragraph about the Age of Exploration attributed to an "Emery Heywood." I figured he was a writer or a historian and his writing style was so unique I decided to look him up to see what else he wrote. I can find no trace of any writer or historian by that name on the Internet.

Does anyone here know who this person was and what his (or her?) connection to de Voto was? I am quite curious now...
 














 save them hood 




 Nope, I'm sure it's still there. It's a series of videos and the girl who created them is obviously trying to make a name for herself as a "teen advice" specialist or something like that. She has a whole channel. The video had like 60,000 views or something like that when I watched it. 




 Blond hair, long and curly, more than that I don't remember. She talked like the stereotypical "valley girl" which made it all the more funny.
