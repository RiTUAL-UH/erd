 The full expression is "deus ex machina", and it is a character or thing that suddenly enters the story in a novel, play, movie, etc., and solves a problem that had previously seemed impossible to solve.
 




 Scarface. 




 Brits can't even spell "pedophile" properly. 




 We've done several city/state projects; I hate that lowest bidder rule. 




 Depends on the contractor, but yeah.  When doing above-ceiling inspections, I've seem some shady shit. 




 I'm caucasoid, yes. 




 Pretty much.  Lighting design is part of my job. 




 Man, just looking at that gives me [heartburn](http://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/photogallery_heartburn_and_foods_dos_and_donts_01_full.jpg). 




 I laugh every time I see video of someone thinking a pendant light's support system could possibly support the full weight of a human.

People have no common sense anymore. 




 This GIF made me want to watch that movie.

I'm 34, but I've never watched it before. 




 Nope. Haven't tried it. 




 No kidding!

I think [Batley](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/73/78/1b/73781b667c5f69dbc9f003ab5bc8de49.jpg) was modeled after [R.L. Stine](https://vice-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2012/07/26/hunting-rl-stine-at-the-years-biggest-thriller-conference-1413334875919.jpeg). 




 Amen to that. 




 Wow--that's sad.  Have a pity up-vote. 




 Hey, look--a lot of people I don't find particularly funny... 




 I work in AutoCAD 2015 every day... but never in 3D space.

That's badass.  Might've been easier in Revit. 




 The U.S. government having orchestrated the 9/11 attack.  Too much plausible evidence supporting it. 




 More songs:

["Bless Your Beautiful Hide"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5v76vifE8E)

["Goin' Courtin'"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0xxT0glNsQ) 




 When I first heard the plan that Maine was going, I cheered for them.  I wish every state would do it.  Force people to TRY before you give them free handouts on the taxpayer dollar.

No wonder Democrats hate it, they will lose their control over their voters. 




 There is no "right" way in math.

Math == getting_correct_answer 




 [This is part of it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TygmMPbwfjA) 




 The songs, but the barn-raising scene (s) are the best! 




 I thought it was gonna be the "...wow..." video. Boy, was I wrong. 




 ...as if they don't already... 




 30 years of gaming.... if you go back and re-purchase the games so you can olay them. 




 My Fair Lady

Seven Brides for Seven Brothers 









 Bwa-ha-ha-ha!

What a stupid teaser. 




 f(x) = [x^(2+4)]-8

Just move the entire graph down vertically by 8 units. 




 I laughed when I read that America doesn't have a work ethic problem.

They clearly haven't gone anywhere in the service industry where I live.  Most workers just don't give a crap. 




 I think they are completely separate from angels.  They co-exist with human spirits in Heaven.  While human spirits exist in Heaven only to worship the Holy Trinity, the angelic masses server purposes or roles based on their level in the angelic hierarchy:

1st Triad - Seraphim  Cherubim  Thrones

2nd Triad - Dominions  Virtures  Powers

3rd Triad - Principalities  Archangels  Angels 




 Funny enough--it was me that misspoke.

This post is my fault.  I'm so, so sorry. 




 Reminded me of [this scene](http://www.tboake.com/images/film_images/fifth_element/fifth5/fifth5_web/cap161_resize.jpg) from Fifth Element. 




 Technically, all the beings God created had free will.

Lucifer wanted to be like God and create life to worship him.  THIS is what he started the war in Heaven over.  He convinced masses of other angels to rebel with him. 




 Not true; no one prays for demons or evil spirits either. 




 Christians pray for human souls.  Lucifer never was, and never will be, a human soul.  He was created as an angel directly by God.  He desired free-will, and turned away from God.

Prayers by humans could never reverse what was done. 




 For the lazy -- It's a link to "Let It Go" from Frozen. 




 I'd say he was 2nd best. 




 Nothing that useful. 




 Best character in the series portrayed by the best actor in the series.

 Depends on quantity and type of troops available.

Personally, I'd use heavies and zookas.  I'd drop 2-3 artillery on the launcher; drop a barrage or two on the boom; then utilize shocks while my heavies/zookas attacked everything. 




 [Some people have too much to worry about.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GEkNhRyClgo/UO4zsvyjCaI/AAAAAAAAI6o/7ktjV5HQHb8/s640/peter-griffin-who-the-hell-cares.jpg) 




 I'd focus on +GBE, +TroopHealth, and +TroopDamage.  Everything else is lagniappe. 









 How sad!  It's an epidemic! 




 "Wish my heavy husband would spend more time at home than with that zooka partner of his..." 




 Seriously?  Good to know. 




 That is freaking insane.

Another reason to tell my 3yo and 4yo to stay away from the cable and telephone pedestals in our back yard. 









 Yet another reason why I like Microsoft over Macintosh/Apple.

Steve Jobs was a huge, asshole-ish thief. 




 Electrical designer.  I design the electrical systems (e.g., lighting, power, mechanical connections, special systems, etc.) of buildings. 









 It's just the track-record of his shows.  My original post was meant to be sort of tongue-in-cheek.

I like that article though. 




  I know it was renewed after episode 1, but that can be changed if ratings don't keep up.

See my original post:

 The not feeling empathy was a side-note.

As for Summer Glau, the only things I've liked her in were where she's playing robot-like characters (Firefly/Serenity and Terminator).  I wasn't a fan of her in The Arrow. 




 But he shows so little emotion that I don't feel no empathy towards him.  I care more about his psychiatrist than I do him. 




 Yeah--that's retarded as well.  That's why I don't watch pro sports.  Grown men/women getting paid millions to play a kids game... *smh* 




 Every television show that stars Christian Slater has never made it past Season 1... some didn't even complete a full season before it was pulled.

I know it was renewed after episode 1, but that can be changed if ratings don't keep up.

Don't get your hopes up for this show.  I've watched all the episodes so far, and I don't feel a connection to ANY of the characters--much less Elliot. 




 What the fuck is wrong with this country when a no-talent, screaming, asshole like PDP can make $7.5M a year when hard-working, bill-paying, child-raising people like me struggle paycheck to paycheck?! 




 Why change what worked.  I never equated spanking as hitting.  It was punishment given to me by my parents for what I did--it wasn't them hitting me. 




 56% of Catholics support gay marriage?!  What in the--?!

Having homosexual urges == not a sin.

Acting on homosexual urges == a sin (i.e., adultery).

If Catholics accept homosexual marriage, it would no longer be considered adultery, and therefore would no longer be a sin.  This, in essence, would be changing church dogma.  How are any Catholics for same-sex marriage? 




 Not a terrible parent. I've done the same thing to an older child.

Only step you left out that I would have done was spanking. I was spanked as a child, and it was effing effective. 









 Anakin Skywalker did not bring balance to the Force, because Luke and Leia were still alive--thus tipping the Force to the light side. 




 Yeah--okay. You're real and everything--sure... 




 Not a bad idea. 




 I agree. If they're going to legalize same-sex, might as well legalize them all. 




 That's what I get for trusting auto-fill on my phone. Snrk. 














 I was 2... 




 Note to self: Never go to Northern Georgia. 




 Former Papa John's driver here.

I knocked on an apartment door, and when it opened, the smell of weed wafted out.  Some skanky-looking blonde says, "Hey--come on in."  "Uhhhh....," I replied, "...okay...".

They had porn playing on the TV, and not only were the visuals distracting, but the incessant moaning of the woman on the screen.

They said to set the pizza down on the coffee table.  I went to do so, and realized that I had to miss the lines of cocaine they had ready to go.

She hands a wallet to a guy sitting there, and he hands me cash.  With a wink he said, "A little something extra for being such a nice guy."  I walked back to my car shaking my head, and expecting a nice tip.  After taking out the price of the pizza, it was a whopping $3.05 tip.

I should've called the cops on the cheap bastards.  HAHA! 




 It's SFW... there's nothing there except a woman in a shirt.

Did you try /r/GrossFingernails ? 




 I thought along the same lines.

[Reminded me of this old Disney cartoon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqEVYbPw9lI feature=youtu.be t=55s) 




 No, I can't stand that.  I have an older guy we work with on occasion (friend of the family) that calls me "Stevie".  I'm a grown man with three kids (one of which is a teenager), and he calls me Stevie.  SMH 




 Well, that was SO not worth the wait. 




 Psh--I wish I had been a hacker.  I had downloaded a few "viruses", but had no idea what to do with them.  HAHA!  I was not a l337 h4xx0r. 




 Pretty sure they had started killing it (hence the bloody-looking neck wound and knife-wielding, blue-shirted man), and it decided to fight back. 




 What's with the link in the "f"? 




 No.  I'm a 34yo man with nothing to hide.  I don't need my 90's "hacker" alias of "CorruptShadow" anymore. 




 Holy crap--how did you know my name?! 




 Exactly, I try not to be a dick, and to just be myself. 




 Um...yes...because I do. 




 Odds are, if it wasn't seen on the show, it's fake. 




 In Louisiana, where I live, it appears to be the "black culture".  I can only attribute the harsher viewpoints on the fact that the black culture in this area is gangbanger. I'd assume a gay gangbanger would be labeled as a punk and not "hard".

What are your experiences? 




 Clean neck (just shaved this morning).

I just don't like bad movies.  




 Well, if that is true, I greatly appreciate the comment! 




 Agreed. Lots of sex and violence in ASOIAF... 




 Defensive much? I thought it was boring. But I'm 34, and you're probably younger (and less picky) about your movies. 









 That GIF made me LOL.

 I hope he gets that... thing... on his chin removed first, or it'll distract the hell out of me. 




 I'm actually "re-reading" them via Audible.  I'm about 2/3 through book four with no glaring issues.  I don't remember very graphic scenes being described as in GoT or anything. 




 That has to friggin hurt like a mofo! 




 And it was a crappy movie.  What a waste of effort, Jeff. 




 HA! 




 God, please no... well... only if it's Abrams and not Lucas in charge. 




 Here you go, /u/Sommern ! 









 At home and in bed now. Maybe tomorrow. If I do, I'll tag ya. Hehe...
