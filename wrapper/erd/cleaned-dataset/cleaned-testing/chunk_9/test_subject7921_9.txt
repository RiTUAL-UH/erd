 Presumably your friends have similar interests to you.  And chances are their girlfriends will have those interests, and you're already introduced to them which is a lot of the work already done.

I don't think it's right while they are involved, once broken up.....I can see both sides of the argument.  If you REALLY like them and want to be more than sex..... I can see doing it without your friends permission/approval if you are prepared to lose the friend.  

The secret part for just sex.....some people just have a totally different outlook/value system.
 




 They are spectacular.
 




 More angles please. 




 Be my friend.  We have similar interests, I like seeing boobs, you have boobs.
 




 Look into Guild Wars, can get it for 10 dollars often and no monthly fees, etc.

 




 I've been trying to be more "open" to the possibility that people aren't all out to take advantage of me/you/whoever, etc.  But there are definitely people who will absolutely use that openness and trust to get what they want.

Your way of thinking will make you happier and you SHOULDNT have to worry about people hurting you, but it can happen.  So I just hope you keep that in mind and take some reasonable precautions.  

Otherwise a very nice post and I appreciate it.  




 Depends, if you know they need to sleep a lot, it'd be REALLLLY annoying for the phone to be ringing while you are recovering.

If you know they are active/awake then sure.  Or just leave a voicemail by going straight to voicemail to avoid bugging them with the phone ringing....or other form of communication that isn't immediate and ask em to call you when they are able.
 




 I want some.
 




 He's helped some, but yeah I think about it often and still feel it's pretty true.

Of course thinking like that also has the qualities of a self-fulfilling prophecy. 




 The depressed.  Because it feels like a lot of us are "adrift" or "unattached" in some way that other people have.....shrug.
 




 People are pretty self obsessed, and this is a prime example.  Not even malicious, but still hurts just the same.
 




 Therapist told me today that like 70% of people's "motivation" is revenge.  I GUESS you could get revenge on your friend, but then you'd be an asshole.  But maybe you'd be a happy asshole.  Said in a joking/not joking kind of way.
 




 Yeah when you're in the pit, it's very hard to see a way out.

Envision a circle of light surrounded by darkness, it could be the path up and out, or you could be looking up as you fall deeper in.  That little "click" in your head for thinking is ALL you have to do, and it seems pretty impossible.
 




 There's some truth to this where the negative aspects get over emphasized, or neutral encounters become negative when seen through the depression cloud.

And yeah, I have discussed this before.  Although I haven't titled it quite so eloquently as "disposable people" to him.  I have a feeling he would disagree. 




 It does seem like it.  Especially in the US, people ask "What do you do?" to define you.  It's not QUITE as bad as it was with the economy destroying lives, but yeah....job is a huge part of your "worth" for most.

Kinda terrifying. 




 This just kind of happens normally from what I've seen.  Marriages, kids, moving away for jobs.  If they are high school friends, I don't think I stayed in touch with a single one of them past college.

But yeah these subjects are not something most people can understand. 




 4 and 5, 4 probably if you have frequent Poop_Attacks, the straps will help hold it on.
 




 Yeah, I haven't had hope of alright for awhile now.   Just lately it's been way worse.  Everything seems very superficial and pointless.

 




 Yeah, not really seeing a point in un-fucking my life lately. 




 You have me beat.   I am just contemplating my worthlessness.   I'm sorry to hear about your situation.   I envy that you had someone even if it didn't last.  




 There now can't even sleep it off.   Tomorrow is going to be horrible.  




 I'm laying in bed unable to sleep and that question keeps popping in my head.   I feel like I could disappear tomorrow and my "friends" wouldn't notice for months potentially years.   Trying to meet new people seems like someone is playing a joke on me.   Respond to an ad on r4r,  LITERALLY contacting someone who claims that want to talk and it must just be anyone but me.   

Then you have the "professionals" who are there to help you.   It's really hard to take what they say to heart when you know it'd look pretty bad for them if you went out and offed yourself.   It's just REALLY hard to tell when someone cares even a little bit anymore. 

And it's amusing to me because the only thing I want to do in response to all of this "lack" of attention is just kill any and all means of communication with people.   Stop seeing the therapist, stop taking meds,  remove contacts from Facebook, remove any and all messaging apps,  delete this account,  etc. 

Stupid way to approach the lonely problem,  but seems completely logical when I'm thinking on it.   Like a punishment for "them" and they likely won't even notice.   And then you discover how disposable/replaceable you really are.   I am very disposable.  




 Never got into a lot of detail with him.  But the way it was described made me think he was day trading to some extent.  I don't have any personal experience with it, but figured the OP might look into it since I'm sure someone on Reddit could advise if he has disposable income and a will.
