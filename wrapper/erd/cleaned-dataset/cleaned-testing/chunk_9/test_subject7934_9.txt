 Krugman explains the standard Keynsian argument on this as "my spending is your income":
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/opinion/krugman-the-austerity-agenda.html

Reducing income during a recession (what "austerians" advocate) cuts everyone's income, cuts spending, and further hurts the economy.

 A bunch of articles by Niall Ferguson. LOL.  Could you possibly choose a more thoroughly discredited source?

The Columbia Journalism Review: [Newsweeks Niall Ferguson debacle.  A misleading cover story gets the wrong kind of buzz for Tina Brown's mag](http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/newsweeks_niall_ferguson_debac.php )

The Atlantic: [Harvard historian Niall Ferguson still thinks bluster can substitute for facts.](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/10/truth-in-the-age-of-niallism/280507/ )

[A full fact check of Niall Ferguson's Very Bad Argument Against Obama](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/08/a-full-fact-check-of-niall-fergusons-very-bad-argument-against-obama/261306/ )

Jonathan Chait's take down is particularly worthy of a read: [Niall Ferguson Fights Back Against Smear Campaign by Fact-checkers, Facts](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/06/niall-ferguson-fights-back-against-fact-checkers.html)

 Committing the odd factual error is an occupational hazard in journalism. For Niall Ferguson, the commission of error is more than a hazard. Its a cherished way of life. 

Well, at least Niall finally admitted Krugman was right: http://www.businessinsider.com/niall-ferguson-paul-krugman-was-right-2012-1

[Even GWB's Axis of Evil speechwriter admitted that](http://www.frumforum.com/were-our-enemies-right/ ): "Imagine, if you will, someone who read only the Wall Street Journal editorial page between 2000 and 2011, and someone in the same period who read only the collected columns of Paul Krugman. Which reader would have been better informed about the realities of the current economic crisis? The answer, I think, should give us pause. Can it be that our enemies were right?" 









 [Does that then apply to the Germans who are currently lecturing the rest of Europe?](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-07-06/piketty-germany-has-never-repaid-its-debts-it-has-no-standing-lecture-other-nations) 




 So in other words, we should ignore your comment.'

Just curious - do you examine every URL on Reddit before you click it to make sure you're not lining the pockets of Krugman? 




 Krugman discusses the solution in the article.  Did you read it? 




 I did a searches for "austerity worked in europe" and "austerity ireland",  "austerity spain", "austerity portugal", and came up with results like the following.  These stories don't exactly make austerity look like a success.

http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/analysis/irelands-austerity-success-is-no-model-for-greece-340662.html

 GREECE is being told to follow Irelands crisis solution of harsh austerity and acceptance of bank-and-bailout debt. This narrative conveniently ignores that the Irish recovery has been built on major human rights violations and the undermining of long-term social and economic development.

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/13/economic-austerity-ireland

But under the heartening symbolism of a free state restored, a host of troubling statistics remain, after five years of budgeting by bludgeon. Previously low public debt remains well in excess of national income, and although Dublin is currently proudly financing this through private means, any fresh bout of market jitters could send it back to the emergency room. The unemployment rate remains in double digits, and in a few short years, one young man in every 10 has left the country. The human toll has been devastating. 

http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/thousands-rally-spanish-anti-austerity-protest-150321200719255.html

 Spain is emerging from a seven-year economic slump as one of the eurozone's fastest growing countries, but the exit from recession has yet to ease the hardship for thousands of households, in a country where nearly one in four of the workforce is out of a job.

http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26703528

 Spain austerity: Huge Madrid protest turns violent

http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21653653-perhaps-surprisingly-anti-austerity-and-populist-parties-are-not-doing-well-austerity-without

 PORTUGAL is no country for young men. A third of the under-25s are out of work. Of graduates under 35 with a job, almost half earn less than 900 ($1,000) a month. This is the 500 generation, referring to the minimum monthly wage that many earn on short-term contracts in call-centres or supermarkets. Emigration is at levels unseen since the 1960s.

 ... Antnio Costa, the former mayor of Lisbon, who took over as PS leader last November, promises to turn the page on austerity, saying it has produced nothing but poverty. Despite the bail-out, he notes that the public debt has risen to 130% of GDP, a level many economists see as unsustainable. 



 




 Which ones are you thinking of?  I have family in Spain, and my impression is that it's been a disaster there. 




 Not my comment - it's a direct quote from the article.  Check the link from the word "arithmetic" in the actual article to understand the meaning of this. 





























 Lloyd Blankfein here. Where the hell is Hillary's Goldman patch? 




 You're not the only one thinking this:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/04/greece-isnt-the-first-country-to-have-a-debt-referendum-does-iceland-provide-useful-lessons/ 














 Ok, then.  From my own observation, everything that comes out of Steve Moore's mouth is a lie. 




 First of all, let's note that the author of this piece, Peter Rogof, is part of some far right wing public policy organizations "Let Freedom Ring" and "Frontiers of Freedom". He writes for National Review, Fox News' opinion section, and The Daily Caller,

So Politifact finds that conservatives are liars.  Two possibilities - Politifact has a leftist bias, or conservatives are liars.

Here's what Rogof says:

 The fact that, as the Lichter study shows, "A majority of Democratic statements (54 percent) were rated as mostly or entirely true, compared to only 18 percent of Republican statements," **probably** has more to do with how the statements were picked and the subjective bias of the fact checker involved than anything remotely empirical.

Emphasis mine.  I.e., Rogof doesn't like the conclusion, so assumes that Politifact is conspiring against the right.  

Here he is  quoting James Taranto in an attempt to refute Politifact:

 As the Wall Street Journal's James Taranto has consistently reported, the fact checking business often  too often for anyone's good  turns on matters of opinion rather than matters of "fact." 

Taranto is another right wing polemicist who is no doubt hurt that conservative statements are being shown in a negative light, so it's hard to take this opinion seriously.

Even the study, by another conservative (Rogof's professor) admits that Politifact pays equal attention to both Democratic and Republican statements.  

The worst the author can find is that "PolitiFact chose to highlight untrue statements made by those in the party out of power", but there's no evidence that this amounts to selection bias.  Around the same time the study came out, it was found that [Republicans get twice as much air time as Democrats](http://thinkprogress.org/media/2012/01/24/410742/sunday-morning-talk-shows-featured-twice-as-many-republicans-as-dems-last-year/ ).  By this metric, it could be argued that Politifact is biased *against* Democrats (possibly in an effort to show balance).  In fact, [some on the left allege just this](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2012_01/politifact_keeps_falling_short034982.php ).

**TL;DR - this critique of Politifact seems to be nothing more than butthurt conservatives being exposed as liars**

 




 The problem is that austerity can't work:
http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/austerity-arithmetic

There's evidence that Merkel knew this. http://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8883307/merkel-nsa-wikileaks-greek-crisis 

So why did they put the screws on Greece?  One hypothesis is that they want to get rid of the leftist government. 




 Interesting.  I just perused [his tax plan page](https://randpaul.com/issue/taxes ).

He sounds like a complete loon:

My tax plan would blow up the tax code and start over. In consultation with some of the top tax experts in the country, including the Heritage Foundations Stephen Moore, former presidential candidate Steve Forbes and Reagan economist Arthur Laffer, I devised a 21st-century tax code that would establish a 14.5% flat-rate tax applied equally to all personal income, including wages, salaries, dividends, capital gains, rents and interest.

Wow.  Same supply-side nonsense peddled by the same set of repeatedly discredited sources.  

Arthur Laffer's curve has been totally discredited, and has a couple of statements on politifact, one false and one half true.

Steve Moore on the other hand achieved a remarkable score: http://www.politifact.com/search/?q=steve+moore

* 3 pants on fire
* 3 false
* 4 mostly false
* 1 half truth
* 1 mostly true statement

I.e., 10/12 things this man says are falsehoods.


And then there's this.

 We now know that the IRS, through political hacks like former IRS official Lois Lerner, routinely abused its auditing power to build an enemies list and harass anyone who might be adversarial to President Obamas policies.

He needs to take his meds. 




 Thanks! 




 Who is that? 




 What  policy issues does your friend cares about that cause him to select Rand Paul? 




 Nicely done, sir. 









 This is different. Look at OP's submissions and comments.

And before you accuse me of being an Israel apologist, know that I've posted my share of Israel-critical commentary here on Reddit. 




 HA HA HA you are funny.

Please tell more jokes. 









 David Frum, GWB's 'Axis of Evil' speechwriter:

["Imagine, if you will, someone who read only the Wall Street Journal editorial page between 2000 and 2011, and someone in the same period who read only the collected columns of Paul Krugman. Which reader would have been better informed about the realities of the current economic crisis? The answer, I think, should give us pause. Can it be that our enemies were right?"]( http://www.frumforum.com/were-our-enemies-right/ ) 




 As GWB said, ["uniquely American, idn't it?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIjo-dWE1Jg ) 














 Donald Trump, like other white supremacists, is spreading hate speech.  The Charleston shooter didn't just invent his ideologies out of nothing.  Words have consequences. 




 It's a republished  Reuters article. 









 Hmmm... point taken.  I ought not to have repeated his name. 




  I think one of the biggest reasons to support her is the fact that the next president will likely nominate one, two or maybe even three judges to the supreme court (should they be a two term president). 

Yeh, I totally hear you on that.

 Forget all other issues for a moment. 

That is exactly what the DLC is hoping we all do.  It's a devil's bargain.

 Not voting or voting third party could easily hand the presidency to the GOP and we can't allow that to happen

You know, I'm genuinely torn on this.  On the one hand, you're absolutely right --- the Republicans will be a disaster zone.  On the other hand, so will Clinton --- just not as much.  And it's important we look at it from that perspective.  

The American system has been tweaked by wealthy elites so that we now have two parties which serve the same basic interests, with small variations between the two to give the appearance of choice, like Coke versus Pepsi.  The more similar the two are, the more hot and intemperate the debate becomes on the side issues.  

Gaming this out - if Clinton wins, it strengthens the hand of the DLC.  They'll argue that their economically right wing, hawkish policies are the only way that Democrats can win.  And the elites win again.

And from another perspective, pledging your vote to someone --- no matter what --- means that you've given up your bargaining power.  The reliable Democratic voter can be ignored.  That's why things keep drifting further and further right on the economic front.  

Rachel Maddow had a great think piece on this several years back: http://www.salon.com/2011/04/05/democrats_51/

 **The Republicans may not love their base, but they fear them and play to them.** The Democratic Party institutional structures of D.C., and the Beltway press in particular, not only hate the Democratic base  they think its good politics for Democratic politicians to kick that base publicly whenever possible.

 Only the base itself will ever change that.
 




 Yep, and no coverage of the Wisconsin speech, which was the biggest crowd by far for anyone in the 2016 race, but three articles on Clinton. 




 Donald Trump said almost the same thing as  the Charleston shooter before he gunned down 9 people.  It's now over two weeks since that speech. The reason no Republican came out and condemned him (notice Jeb had to be asked) is that the party is filled with racists, and they can't afford to piss them off. 




 Let me put it another way - women already deal with a lot of body issues.  A woman reading this thread (I'm a guy, in case you haven't already guessed) is going to see a bunch of men ganging up on a woman based on her looks.  And she is a CEO and was a partner at possibly the most prestigious VC firm in the world.

I mean - there are so many male CEOs who've done terrible things.  But the conversation never takes this turn for them.  For a woman looking at this thread, the message is loud and clear --- even a woman who has reached such a high level in her career will be subject to low blows. It's a culture of intimidation.

It feels like a bunch of animals in a feeding frenzy here.

**EDIT** Here's Sandra Bullock saying essentially the same thing:
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/01/sandra-bullock-women-attacked-in-media_n_7707290.html 




  What makes you think that the same couldn't have happened had it been about a man ? 

Because that *almost never* happens, whereas it constantly happens with women.  

 I get it the people are flinging way too much. On the other hand, people are rooting for /u/chooter . I suppose she is a female too.

Disagree.  That people in the community are rooting for one employee who happens to be female does not make misogynistic attacks elsewhere in the site ok.

 Do you think that all this shitstorm is just because she is female ?

Absolutely not.  Her lawsuit combined with her behavior towards other employees at KPBC, her husband's lawsuits and shady dealings all cast a shadow over her.  Her mismanagement as interim CEO then triggered the storm.  She should go.

There are lots of things to criticize her for.  Her sexual attractiveness is not one of them, and should not be.
 









 Dylan Storm Roof before he killed 9 people in Charleston, SC:

"You are raping our women and taking over the country."

 




 He's in sync with Republican voters. 




 No. [Backpfeifengesicht](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Backpfeifengesicht ). 




 Reducing a woman to her physical appearance is a form of misogyny.  It undercuts women's achievements and suggests that nothing is more important that their physical appeal.  Once we go there, it opens the door to all kinds of degrading commentary, for example:

 Maybe she takes it in the pooper like a champ. 

This whole thing on reddit is degenerating into a feeding frenzy.  Now, we're going after the basest kind of attack on  women.  I don't like what Ellen Pao did, but I'm so not on board with this shit.
 




 Not all Liberal issues are of equal weight.  To my mind, economic  and military issues are paramount, and Hillary is only slightly better than, say, a Mitt Romney on this front.  

Elites have managed to control the left by throwing them bones on social issues, while working doggedly to cement in place the neoliberal program.  Hillary Clinton is a part of this.  Her role will be to manage expectations of the left.  The money she takes from Goldman, Walmart and god knows who else, is to protect their interests.  Her behavior on TPP was absolutely disgusting -- giving the impression of opposition, while actually being one of the actors who was pushing it through.

We've had 40 years of this kind of behavior from Democrats.  In the long game, it leads to increased cynicism (look at voter turnout and ratings of our government).  I'm uninterested in another liar in the bully pulpit. 




 Some good supporting data here --- http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/04/no-puerto-rico-isnt-greece/ 




 Seriously 133 upvotes for this?  I don't like what Ellen Pao and her husband have done, but this thread is becoming pure misogyny.  Y'all should be ashamed of yourselves. 




 Painful how illiterate old media still is about the internet. 




 The paper has a pretty interesting take on this idea.  I couldn't do it justice in the title.   









  Show of hands: How many would prefer a replay of what Nader did to Gore?

Please explain your fear that the Democratic party will run two candidates for President.

 I feel so bad for them. 




 The only person telling the truth right now is Sanders. 














 I think he ought to get attention.  He represents the views of a significant faction of the Republican party --- he is second in the polls, after all. 

Let them own it.   




 I don't think it's possible to give this man too much attention.

Just ask him. 




 Ok, so are you saying that people of African descent are genetically predisposed to violence? 




 Just curious about the rest of your argument.  Do you believe that black people are genetically more predisposed to violence than people with other skin color, or do you believe that it is their culture?  I'm assuming you discount that poverty is an explanation.

== Sanders is still largely unknown (50-59% "haven't heard enough about him" to make up their minds).

Done with this thread.
 









  In the best-case scenario, this was mere oversight and some unintentionally poor editing. In the worst, it is an attempt to stifle opposition within the Democratic Party

I think it's something different, more subtle and more insidious.  The reporters and editors are part of the Washington insider culture.  They all tell each other that Sanders candidacy is something not to be taken seriously.  If someone suggests that his traction is an important story, they'll be greeted with a smirk.  That wouldn't be the case if it were Biden or O'Malley drawing these crowds, of course.  But that is how institutional bias works - weak minds are shamed into conforming. 














 Embarassed.  Busy day, on iPhone, etc.   




 Tweets are good too 




 In San Francisco, only personal experience.  Studies in other cities support my view though:

From a bike blog:

 Thirty-six percent of cars and 71 percent of bikes failed to stop, which averaged 60 percent non-compliance among all vehicle types. The difference between the behavior of people when they sat behind a steering wheel and when they sat atop a bicycle seat was significant: 34 percent more people disobeyed the law when they rode their bikes.

http://bikeportland.org/2014/06/05/lifestyle-column-observing-analyzing-portlands-stop-sign-culture-106867

Bikers are much worse for stop lights:

 The report [PDF](http://media.oregonlive.com/commuting/other/SCI%20201%20Project%202.pdf ) is available here, and shows that of the 497 cars observed only 36 ran red lights, while 58 of the 99 bicycles observed blew right through. That's about 7 percent of cars compared to 58 percent of bicycles.

http://www.citylab.com/commute/2011/12/uncomfortable-relationship-between-bikes-and-red-lights/623/

 




 Cyclists are *far* more likely to run through stop signs, though.  In San Francisco, there are definitely a contingent of self righteous assholes that flour traffic laws and act rudely toward drivers and pedestrians.  These people create a lot of bad will towards bikers.

**EDIT**: "flour"  "flout" 




  They were both incredibly popular niche candidates, loved by the fringe of both parties

*Ron Paul* was a niche candidate.  **Did you watch the videos of him being booed?** I notice that you haven't responded to that.  Ron Paul's main positions were *hated* by  huge swaths of  GOP primary voters.  
Sanders, on the other hand, takes positions that the Democratic base *loves*.  If you think I'm wrong --- **show me the evidence**.    And it's not just the Democratic base --- his policy positions line up with what the American public actually wants, but few in Washington speak about: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/

Ron Paul came in 5th in Iowa with 10% of the vote.  Sanders is already polling second there at 33% to Hillary's 56%.  Also, you point out how Ron Paul was popular here on Reddit.  Notice how /r/politics is liberal?  Being wildly popular with a liberal audience might just possibly explain why he had trouble in the GOP primaries.

A [Zogby poll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul_presidential_campaign,_2008#Polling
 ) seems to confirm this - " However, Paul was first when Democrats and Independents were included in the survey."

The place where the two are similar is in recognition by the media, so I agree with you, Sanders has an uphill battle on that front.  But on the issues and alignment with the base and the American public, the two couldn't be more different.  Hopefully, that still counts.
 




  Ron Paul supporters also claimed that his views were massively popular, both within the GOP and the country at large. It's incredible how similar the campaign dynamics are

That is a pretty weak claim of similarity.  It's like saying "they both have gray hair too.  Will Sanders supporters not acknowledge this?"

The point is: read my argument again, and show us the polls.  Ron Paul *was* out of step with the GOP base on several core issues.  He was even booed on stage during the debates:

* [In South Carolina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v8qtZ3I5AM)
* [In Tampa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWnFKB9yL08)

The opposite will be true of Sanders.



 




 There hasn't even been a debate yet.

The primaries are won one state at a time.

He's jumped to 33% (compared to Clinton's 52%) in Iowa.
 




  because reddit is an echo chamber and none of these people are actually going to vote
 
Reddit and Iowa. http://time.com/3943994/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-iowa/ 




 Ron Paul took positions that put him directly at odds with the GOP base - on the military, the drug war and mass surveillance.  Sanders is the opposite -- he is voicing positions that are hugely popular with the Democratic base ([and the majority of Americans](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/ )).

 




 He has a lot of supporters in the senior demo, according to the NYTimes: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign.html

 




 Sanders made it an issue in the primaries by releasing a statement that campaigns should be publicly financed.  Clinton then started releasing vague statements against Citizens United, but offered no plan. 









 There are reasons to view Clinton skeptically on this issue.

* No record to speak of until Sanders made it an issue
* Long and close relationships with wealthy political donors who are opposed to progressive values
* first Democratic candidate [to fully embrace super PACs](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-court-donors-for-super-pac.html).  
* stands to gain much so from current system that  Public Integrity named her ["The Citizen's United Candidate"](http://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/01/21/14140/hillary-clinton-citizens-united-candidate) last year.
* Her behavior on TPP shows she doesn't necessarily mean what she says (see below)

* *  *

Remember how she feigned opposition to the TPP and released a statement [urging Obama to "listen to Pelosi"](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/14/hillary-clinton-trade-deal_n_7580768.html )?  Just days later, [Pelosi capitulated and paved the way for fast track status](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/24/pelosi-backs-taa_n_7654954.html ).  In fact, [Clinton undoubtedly knew what many Washington insiders already observed](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/white-houses-secret-weapon-on-trade-nancy-pelosi-118565.html ): Pelosi was actively looking to corral votes for TPP in a way that would minimize political damage.  That is how politics gets done --- dishonest insiders like Clinton are experts at misleading the base.  She got the benefit of appearing to be against TPP, taking soft positions, being vague, and ultimately inoculating herself on this issue for those who weren't paying attention.  As it turns out, though she tried to pretend like she was against it, [she was actually instrumental in negotiating TPP](http://www.ibtimes.com/hillary-clinton-trans-pacific-partnership-obama-aide-calls-her-out-tpp-past-1975980 ).  
 





























 
http://www.wmur.com/politics/wmurcnn-poll-clinton-suddenly-in-a-tight-battle-with-sanders-in-nh/33776056

He's now within 8 points of Hillary in NH.  









 Agree with your take.  Many remakes of 90s action classics are terrible --- arguably, modern action films are often terrible. There's a great piece on the rise of Chaos Cinema that explains what happened:

http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/iowa/release-detail?ReleaseID=2224

Sanders is still largely unknown (50-59% "haven't heard enough about him").  Still Clinton has commanding leads, and as retch-inducing as it is, 75% find her "honest and trustworthy".  What idiots. 




  The greatest public speaker of our generation

Where did you pull that one from? 




 I never thought Ron Paul had a snowball's chance in hell.  I grant that Sander's chances don't look great, but the fundamentals are quite different.   Ron Paul took positions that were diametrically opposed to the GOP base (and thus attractive to people here on Reddit).  Sanders takes positions which are wildly popular with the Democratic base, and which have been ignored for years by third way Democrats like the Clintons and Obama.  There is pent up demand for Democratic leaders to get back to their roots instead of being just another corporatist party.

From this perspective, the primaries are "in play" for Sanders much more than they ever could have been for Ron Paul.  He looked like the crazy uncle in the debates because *everyone* in the audience thought his positions were nuts.  That dynamic will be reversed for Sanders.  Clinton will be seen to be prevaricating and evasive on issues the Dems care about most.  

When they happen, watch the debates then compare with what happened with Ron Paul and then see if you agree with me. 




 No contest.  Those 300 channels of high def TV, cell phones and the internet are far less important than the security of knowing you can own a home and send your kids to school. 




 Interesting -- do you have a link to those numbers? 




 Ron Paul was at odds with the GOP base on surveillance, military intervention, the drug war and other issues.  Not so with Sanders. 




 Nope!   




 % was missing.  Sorry. 




 His platform is what the majority of Americans actually want.  Look at the numbers:

 She was the guaranteed shoe-in last time too. 




 Yeh, it was horrible - the middle class expanded and he had one of the highest approval ratings of any President. 




 Lots of people said a dude named Hussein wouldn't stand a chance after 9/11. 




 Only people who weren't paying attention thought Obama was a progressive.  During the primaries, he praised Reagan, built his platform on the idea that bipartisanship was the solution, sided with the telecom giants on mass surveillance, supported conserva-Dem Joe Lieberman over the excellent progressive challenger Ned Lamont, and even jested about how progressives were fooled in thinking he was one of them.  And the list goes on.  People who were paying attention back them pointed that out (I was one).  

 




 A guy named Hussein for President after 9/11?  

Nah. 














   I am not sure about are his support of universal healthcare (we're 10x the population of Canada, I don't think it's as simple as he thinks it is) 

How does the size of the country change whether universal care will work or not?

  I don't think it's as simple as he thinks it is) and what I think will be a permanent barrier to joining the upper class (huge taxes on $250k+ households, I think that number should be higher)

What are the specific numbers you object to?  To my knowledge he hasn't said what taxes he believes should apply to $250K+.  I know he's talked about taxes on the top bracket and mentioned the rate under Eisenhower, but he only ever used that as an example of what Republicans not too long ago considered acceptable.  His point: we had widespread prosperity under those conditions and we've drifted far to the right on this issue 




 The difference between him and Ron Paul is that Ron Paul was badly out of step with the base (and GOP donors) on a number of issues: mass surveillance, militarism and drug laws.  Sanders, on the other hand, is in lock step on all the major issues and the long frustrated desires of the Democratic base -- and to an extend, the American public.  It's a completely different story.  It's the reason he's drawing the biggest crowds of anyone in the race. 




 Let's get Sanders elected, then we won't have to cajole Clinton to "get serious" about climate change.  Her passions on the subject will only last the duration of the primaries anyway. 














 I think you're still not getting what I'm saying.  Protection of private property is not natural or given.  It tilts the playing field towards people who own property.  The Walton family can pay slave wages to people who do real work while they do very little real work because the government provides free protection of their property.  At the same time, the Waltons don't want to pay for universal health care, social security or other benefits.   




 You're misunderstanding me.  I don't believe in private police *at all*.  Quite the opposite.  My point is that the police are a socialist service that mainly benefits the rich.  The wealthy then turn around and hypocritically complain about socialist services which benefit the vast majority of the people --- like healthcare, free schools, environmental protections, etc.  

TL;DR Government ought not to provide services which disproportionately benefit the rich unless it also balances this with equal benefits for the rest. 




 Hmmm - I might agree with you.

Hillary has already started shifting her position on campaign finance and lobbying to win the primaries.  Will voters be sophisticated enough to understand that she only started saying these things after Bernie made them an issue *and* started getting traction?  Will they realize she'll drop progressive priorities after she gets elected like Obama did?  

I think Sanders's hypothesis is that he can activate people who've dropped out of politics out of disgust who will see his principled campaign as the only hope of avoiding, as he puts it, a slide toward complete oligarchy.  It's an unusual hypothesis to be sure, but some of the numbers --- the approval rating of Congress, low voter turn out, and the swelling crowds for his underfunded campaign --- suggest he might be onto something.  I agree, though, it's an unusual strategy.   




 You might be right, but  how does slinging mud win that battle? 









 I stand with the NRA in blaming the children for not carrying guns. 




 The most consequential socialist program of all is the police and judiciary.  They provide free protection for "private wealth" and contracts.  It is this free service that allows the Waltons to negotiate and maintain lopsided contracts with their workers, while they themselves do little real work.  Of course, the wealthy are big fans of that particular socialist program because it benefits them most of all. 




 He's drawing huge crowds because people are sick of the same old bullshit. 




 Could you unpack that a bit --- not disagreeing with you, just want to understand.  What are some examples of him assuming things about what people know, and how could he do better? 




 That's a sensible analysis, and without a doubt having the media and money on your side are a big part of winning the primaries.  However, another not insignificant part is whether primary voters actually agree with you.  This is where the similarities between Sanders and Paul break down.

Ron Paul, while wildly popular with Libertarian independents, took positions that put him at odds with GOP primary voters.  Namely, his positions on mass surveillance, drug laws and military intervention.  Large parts of the GOP base, and certainly the GOP money, found these ideas absolutely unacceptable - in fact, crazy-Uncle unacceptable.  Add to this the near total domination of right wing politics by Fox News, and it's hard to see how people ever thought he'd have a chance.

Sanders, on the other hand, champions policies which are what Democratic primary voters want, and this at a time when there is rising frustration with the direction the DLC leaders have taken the party.  Clinton's support for NAFTA, surveillance, war, and lobbyists put her directly at odds with the actual policy preferences of Democratic voters.  The "liberal" media, while still actually biased against Sander's brand of populist anti-corporate policies, is more diverse, and Democrats get their news from a wider variety of sources, many of which are online.  The debate is controlled, but less easily so on the Democratic side.  

**TL;DR Many of Paul's policies were controversial with the base, but the opposite is true for Sanders.  Also, liberal media is more diverse than on the right, so Sanders has a chance of getting his message out.** 




 I guess you think the President is the one giving the orders?  Interesting. 




 Yeh, we should only do that to Muslims. 




 A waste for her to be in the VP role.  Much more she can do as a support in the Senate -- or in a role in the cabinet. 




 In general, I agree --- Hillary has huge "view negatively" numbers, which will be very difficult, likely impossible, to erase.  Sanders is low because he is unknown.  Still, the challenge remains for Sanders to get the word out to those groups - as it remains a huge opportunity for him to boost his numbers and carry his momentum to the next level. 




 Clinton has 72% minority support versus 5% for Sanders. http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/bernie-sanders-surging-among-white-democrats-others-love-hillary-n369251.


 




 http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/bernie-sanders-surging-among-white-democrats-others-love-hillary-n369251
  In a new Washington Post/ABC News survey, 56 percent of white Democrats backed Clinton, while 14 percent supported Sanders. 


 **But among non-white Democrats (the survey did not break them down by ethnicity), Clinton had 72 percent support, compared to 5 percent for the Vermont senator.** 




 Griping about the media isn't going to get Sanders elected.  If we want to see him as President we should confront this challenge. 









 I guess people needed a /snark tag for that one? 




 Capitalism polls at 39%, Socialism at 36%. 




 Totally ridiculous regulations, in retrospect.   




 You should also take a look at this: http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/06/like_it_or_not_sanders_socialism_is_mainstream_edi.html 




 You're arguing that Hillary is electable, so we should elect her.  But Clinton is a dyed in the wool neo-liberal, and many of her actual policy goals are directly opposed to core progressive values.  She believes in bailouts for bankers, mass surveillance,  deregulation and lobbying.  The electability argument is a canard that has lead to an ever rightward shift in our politics.  Clinton/Obama third-way Democrats have lead us to a point where the current Democratic Party is far to the right of Nixon, and Congress is viewed less favorably than cockroaches.

"Rape papers" and "socialism" seem like a joke compared to the litany of problems surrounding Clinton.  And let's remember that she has the highest net negative ratings of any politician currently running.  The inside-the-beltway media has poured it on thick to create an aura of inevitability around Clinton because she is one of them.  She is at her absolute peak now, and can only go down.  Negatives don't go away.  She's lost before (to a black guy named Hussein in the post 9/11 era, no less) and she will lose again.  On the other hand, the more people learn about Sanders the higher his numbers go.  Yes, he can and will win the black vote --- once they learn about what he stands for they will be his most loyal supporters.  It's just a matter of getting the word out.


 




 Quite right.  I welcome Hillary Clinton's lies! 




 He and Mika are perfect representatives of the Beltway nattering class.   









 Floridians voted for this shit. 




 LOL.  Thanks for proving my point.  
 




 So no police in your ideal world? 




 Being forced to buy something doesn't solve anything except affecting your right to self-determination. 









 When the government stops forcing me to pay for cops that help the Walton family protect their enormous wealth, I'll agree with you. 




 LOL.  Politico is desperate for an angle to throw cold water on Sanders.  




 Show them this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEM2iDT-VAk 




 Dammit - that was a good speech.  No one has talked like this man in my lifetime. 




 "Can't afford police and judges?  We'll force you to buy it then!"
-- the basis of our private property system.

 




 Don't forget that [she's a proud board member of Walmart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoCPRSrScG8 ).

And that she wants you to know [that she will continue to take money from lobbyists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaAkcXynqLA  ). Lobbyists "represent real Americans", and thinks that "the idea that somehow a contribution is going to influence you" doesn't apply to her.

 




 Don't be convinced by a terrible, short-sighted argument.  For example, consider [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/39aot7/bernie_sanderss_great_idea_free_public_college/cs2xyvx ). 




 The reason this is possible is the same reason that workers everywhere (blue and white collar) are having wages stolen from them: unequal bargaining power.  The rich have little need for money, so they can be all that more demanding in contract terms, which leads to workers giving up more of their labor for less, and the wealthy becoming wealthier *because* they are wealthy.

This is not a natural system --- it was created this way.  Wealthy right wingers argue that we should socialize costs for the protection of property but not for anything else.  Of course, this just happens to benefit them the most.  




 Who has articulated details of their policy positions at this stage? 




 Jail would be the preferred way to wreck Jamie Dimon's shit, IMO. 




 RTFA 




 The ability of Wall Street traders to "own" assets isn't free either.    It derives from the free protection given to property owners through our system of police and judges.  The state creates the ability for those trades to happen.  It ought to tax that non-productive economic activity. 




 If degrees aren't worth the time, people will stop going to college and start picking vocations.  But, currently, degrees *are* worth the time:

|        |         |        |       |
|------|-------|------|------|
| Type of Degree |	Annual Median Salary (2011) |	Gender |
|High school diploma |	$40,050|	Men|
|High school diploma |	$30,010|	Women|
|College with no degree|	$47,070	|Men|
|College with no degree |	$34,590	| Women |
|Associate degree |	$50,930	| Men|
|Associate degree |	$39,290	| Women |
|Bachelor's degree |	$66,200 |	Men |
|Bachelor's degree |	$49,110 |	Women |
| Master's degree |	$83,030 |	Men |
| Master's degree |	$60,300 |	Women |
| Professional degree |	$119,470 |	Men |
| Professional degree |	$80,720 |	Women |
| Doctorate degree |	$100,770 |	Men |
| Doctorate degree |	$77,460 |	Women |

What you're arguing for is maintaining the wages of high paying jobs by limiting the number of workers, and limiting those with access to those jobs to  the children of those who can afford to pay, which leads to an increasingly class-stratified society.  

In any case, both white collar and blue collar jobs will come under pressure as robots do more and more of work.  The deeper problem is that our economic system produces more than enough for everyone, but increasingly only a tiny few reap the rewards.  

Education is not just about creating workers for business owners to exploit.  That is only a relatively recent view that was put forward by conservatives in the 80s.  Personally, I think it is an extremely narrow and poisonous view.  It is worth remembering [what Thomas Jefferson said on the subject](http://politheo.com/thomasjefferson.html ):

 An enlightened citizenry is indispensable for the proper functioning of a republic. Self-government is not possible unless the citizens are educated sufficiently to enable them to exercise oversight. It is therefore imperative that the nation see to it that a suitable education be provided for all its citizens. It should be noted, that when Jefferson speaks of "science," he is often referring to knowledge or learning in general.
It is about creating a thoughtful and informed citizenry.  An educated citizenry capable of critical thinking is a precondition to a functioning democracy.  

That is what this bill is about.  The people of the United States should be smart, educated and rational regardless of their social station.  In an increasingly technological society, it is imperative that voters can understand and deliberate the issues of the day.  That may sound incredibly old fashioned, but just 30 years ago it wasn't.   




 Make a condition for public funding: a maximum student/teacher ratio. 




 The financial transaction tax is a good idea all by itself: http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120755/chris-van-hollen-financial-transaction-tax-would-curb-risky-trading 




 By this reasoning, we shouldn't pay for elementary and highschool so we can increase the value of these degrees too.   

The real answer is that we ought to have an educated workforce.  To the extent that the market isn't interested in those degrees, it will be a waste of time to pursue them, which will reduce demand for those degrees.  Free education is about creating a level playing field. 




 I'm liberal and think that Obama's record on surveillance is illegal, virulently anti-American and ought to be grounds for impeachment.  That said, WTF does it matter how /r/politics happens to have voted on that issue have to do with this thread?  Nothing. 

It's a separate issue - and you need to show stats.  How many posts have been submitted overall?  What is the likelihood that a post will hit the front page --- what if it hits the front page on a closely related reddit?  How many upvotes/user do Obama-bashing stories get on /r/politics versus r/news?  Bitching about some specific news item not getting traction is pretty meaningless. 




 RTFA. 









 I'm not a big fan of Dawkins, but this is little more than a hatchet piece.  No quantitation - just a lot of opinions of from the writer. 




 The guy who secured funding for the internet and identified global warming as a threat.  What a bore. 




 I'm sure he won't do it again. 




 Pay to play
   - Clinton logic 









 He was known for silly gaffes, in a way that sometimes made him seem loveable and sometimes the butt of jokes.
http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,1895156,00.html 




 Here are the examples he cites:

* a student(s) complained he debunked the idea that policies helping black people caused the housing crash
* a student(s) complaining that he "possessed communistical sympathies"
* an abortion debate being cancelled because it might imperil the "welfare and safety of our students"
* an Afropunk band's presence would not have been "safe and healthy"

Excuse me, but all of these sound explicitly like or hint at *conservative* oversensitivity, not a problem with "liberal students" as the title says. 









 I think he didn't attend the meeting where she told the rest of Wall Street she's just lying to win the nomination. 









 Snide idiots - they don't like that someone who's not part of the Washington insider crowd is attracting so much attention.  This is how they respond. 




 A famous economics news site:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Hedge 









 Idiotic yellow-journalism bullshit from the NYTimes.

Sanders is out-raising and outpolling  many members combined of the Republican clown car, who mainstream outlets like this treat as Very Serious and deserving of reverence and respect.  Yet, we get this kind of sneering bullshit from "the paper of record".

They continue their descent into irrelevance.
