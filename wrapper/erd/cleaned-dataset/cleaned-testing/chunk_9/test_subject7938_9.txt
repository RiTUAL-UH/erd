 Haha, alright then. Still, it was handy as a one time use. It cost pennies and some time. 




 Mine did not lift out. There was a good bit of friction on the spear. A tapper could probably do the job, but I only have one and it's busy. 




 I have a feeling that would be true with ABS, but PLA printed a little hot (200-205C) with 20% infill tends to bond well. You could print it on it's side with support without much trouble if you had splitting problems. 




 Yes on the bulldozers. The tires are rated 8-20PSI. At 8 there is significant resistance. Today I commuted 3 miles with 18PSI. It was not bad at all. Slower than my road bike, but easy to keep a good cruising speed and doesn't pull in turns. 




 Yes they are. They definately helped that day, and they attach and detach simply. I like them, but I haven't had them very long either. 




 Screwdriver works alright.

 Sure thing:

 That tree is already not happy.

Where is this? I known a place where I've seen something similar a few years ago. 




 A rainbow should shoot out when you open that. 




 This is the unit I have and it is fantastic. I'm not sure how I got on before hand. All the functionality of a high end Hakko at a third the cost. 









 East Woodman's also has a key kiosk. 




 Not the slickest website, but lots and lots of ideas and basic analog and digital curcuits.

 If drunk running is your thing (it's definitely mine):

 Their --- they're

Not worth it. 




 I'd stay away anyway if they have some kind of swedish Rancor in there. 









 UNIVERSAL serial bus. Screw you Apple. 




 Get drunk. But in costumes.  




 Get studded tires and keep riding. All the shitty bicyclists are off the road by then so it's not as bad as it sounds.

Yay for bikes stopping at stop signs!! 














 Ham isn't obsolete but it is undergoing a shift. It's always been way more targetted to hackers. Now that the hacker/maker community is growing some interesting developments have been happening. New protocols, space balloons, and software defined radio have not (yet) been made obsolete by the internets.

Then there's Echolink, which is a neat mashup.
