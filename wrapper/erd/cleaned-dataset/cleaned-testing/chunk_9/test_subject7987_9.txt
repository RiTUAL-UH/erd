 One of my favorite things to do on board was watch for flying fish.  I work in the engine room, so i would make a point to get out on deck every coffee break and walk up to the bow.  To my knowledge, flying fish only jump when they're threatened, so we'd be sailing through apparently lifeless water, and intermittently we'd hit a patch of them and they'd make these zig zag ripples on the surface as they shot out in every direction.  especially in the Arabian Sea, where the water was crystal clear and always calm, we would go for days where I could count hundreds jumping out of the way of our bow.  I think that Planet Earth does a great job of showing what our oceans are really like.  While it is mostly open and void of larger life, there are always small things like plankton, krill or sea grass, and the oasis where larger life can flourish are plentiful and very different from one another.  Just the color difference alone between the different oceans is really significant based on the makeup of the water and the microorganisms that live there.  After doing a few 4 month trips across the ocean, I realized that I'd rather stay around the Coast of the US.  There's more money to be made on smaller ships and rigs working in the gulf, and I'd rather see land and have time off in frequent bursts than sail a few months and have a few months off.
