 Yeah as others have said, it's a huge pain in the ass to reunite dog and handler like in this case. I think I watched a documentary a while back where a former EOD soldier had an IED go off near him which paralyzed him from the waist down. His dog survived and it took them about 5 years as well to get the dog back to him. He described the situation to be extremely frustrating and that it was unbelievable how many loops you have to jump through and paperwork you have to fill out to get a service dog once they 'retire'. Eventually it happened and the feels man...the feels. 









 You know who has an even better scouting/farm system...the BRAVES! CHOP CHOP CHOP  




 Why of all teams would they hack the Astros? They haven't been that successful in recent years but correct me if I'm wrong.. 




 I like how the one chick at the end is all like fok you m8 I want in on this action! 




 Go to a vagina orchard: count 1,2,3, spin that plant around you got a third world country. That's right consider yourself warned I'm offensive and creative like handicapped porn.

 Spiders love cardboard! 




 Idk...OP Why don't you crawl in and see?  




 He's a real G shawty that will really find your G-spot. 




 Optimus Prime has a flat. 




 My big, goofy German Shorthair did this for our cat. She was a great adoptive mommy! 




 Yeah glad she survived! Most kittens separated from mom that young have lower chances of survival unfortunately. Especially if you thought she was only 12 hours old. My wife rescued a little guy recently and the vet estimated he was three weeks old. Think his mother abandoned him. He only survived about a week longer. RIP Samson miss you little buddy  




 Sounds like how Brick died. "He swam out into the ocean to pet a bird" 




 Nothing. I've done nothing for a Klondike Bar. 




 The title of your post is extremely creative and original! Upvoted. 




 Skylar?!? 




 Looks like he has an eye in the top right. 




 Because they have layers? 




 Exactly. 




 Yeah but "Tats for titties" is so much more gratifying to say  




 Hmmm can't say I didn't see that one coming  




 I give him maybe 10 years. 




 Yeah good luck getting a chip in there and pulling it back out satisfied.. 




 This is a rather politically correct way of saying they have a problem with burglars in their hotel.

 It always cracks me up when I see girls profiles with things like, "not into hook ups" or saying shit like they're there to find the man of their dreams.  




 Imagine dropping acid and going through this. _

 Do you recommend loads of protein for healthy, glowing skin?

 Great save by your husband. He couldn't tell you the truth so he blamed his boss (again) 




 I'm trying to drop 2-3 lbs for a weigh in next week. Do any of you guys have something you recommend that you've had success with? I tried GNCs 2 day juice cleanse recently and wasn't too pleased with it. I'm about 186~ right now and want to get down to 183 or so. 




 Just like you babe  




 No just judy chop everyone  




 *reads will* 

And I leave my big box of por.."books" to my grandson.  




 Ok Paul Blart, I believe you  




 Now I see why OP has reinforced wood at the bottom...got a modern day Shawshank Redemption on our hands 









 Start your day off exercising. Running, weight lifting, whatever you do just fucking do it and stop making excuses. Best way to start your day. 




 Thanks for the clarification for a second I actually thought they had a real weapon at a comic convention  




 You shouldn't you know why?? Because YOU'RE ALL GOING TO DIE DOWN HERE!

 Yeah...first I thought the window was off-center but if you look at right side of room it looks like the dimensions of the room are weird. 




 I'd be reluctant to walk around with a semi automatic rifle, regardless of whether or not it's legal (or if the guns fake). Too risky given the current state of affairs in the US. 




 Yeah not sure what this dumbass was trying to accomplish. Those snakes did look scared as fuck though so maybe that's Satan and that snake pit is the entrance to hell? 




 One does not simply dabble in the Dragon occult  




 Like you babe  




 You've got a great...personality  




 Especially since the VA sucks so much ass. Fuck them. 




 Soooo was she even cute? 




 He's a Cubs fan what does he know anyway  




 Wasn't sure which part this post was referring to until the end. The beginning was almost equally as shitty. 




 Ron Burgundy figured it out in Anchorman 2. Just put it on cruise control and have some beers. 




 You wut m8 









 Ready to order some fucking stuffed French toast! Love ihop 




 I think the part where she mentioned stealing kitchen knives and playing it off like she didn't sent chills up my spine. Her mom said she questioned her and Beth just had a malicious smile on her face.  




 Damn, she's actually kind of sexy. 




 It would have been creepier if its eyes opened mid cut  




 And why the fuck do you need to cut off his tail? 









 What a cringy pre-teen account.

Fixed.
 




  The above-linked video has been circulating since 2009 and is variously reported as an audition for the television showArmenia's Got Talent,Poland's Got Talent, orRussia's Got Talentgone horribly wrong, a haplessly comedic "William Tell" act that ends with one participant taking an arrow straight through the head. No program by any of those names exists, however, and the set shown in the video curiously features only generic signs and props reading"Talent" in English  no fuller program name is displayed, no signage bearing anything written in the language of the country in which this program supposedly aired is evident, and no one in the clip speaks a word of dialogue.

The video can be pegged as fake for a number of reasons, chief among them that if such a horrible accident had truly occurred during the recording of a television show, it would not have been broadcast, and so we'd expect to be viewing the action "raw" as captured by a single camera. Yet the clip has obviously been cleanly edited (to include cuts to the judges' reactions) and has been subject to post-production (to add graphic overlays), simulating the appearance of something that was prepared or aired as part of a finished program. (Notto mention that the bowman fails to evince the least bit of horror or surprise at having "accidentally" shot his partner in the head.)

Some have speculated that this clip was a viral promotion for theCULT Colaenergy drink, a can of which the "victim" ostentatiously takes from one of the judges and places atop his head (with the label properly facing the camera) after failing at multiple efforts to balance an apple on his noggin. However, most likely it was merely intended as a spoof of the modern talent show genre.
