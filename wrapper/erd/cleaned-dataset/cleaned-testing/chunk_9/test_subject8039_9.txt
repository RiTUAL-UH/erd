 It makes too much sense that this world we inhabit is not meant for human souls. There is too much pain and suffering here. 

I feel for you OP. I'm sorry you had to endure that, and I hope Tamara either forgets her hatred, or forgives you with time. 




 Will second. Join in, and just have some fun ;) 




 .....and now my eyes are dry.... 




 Will second this statement...... What the actual fuck did I just read? 




 Salt the living hell out of that thing, then burn in with sage, then take the ashes, and mix them with salt. Then burn that shit too. Clowns are the creepiest things known to mankind. 




 But they can migrate from the couch.... Makes it sound as though they could be anywhere..... 




 If you can, try to get a look at it. Try and describe it for us so we may help you better. Other than that, though, if sleeping under the bed has worked so far, why fix what ain't broke? 




 You should find out what you can. If the police are there, then obviously the problem isn't gone. You need to know how to defend yourself against this thing.  




 .....How did the lady know that he had to sit down and close his eyes? How did she know he was standing? Who is she? What does she know? Who was the entity outside the window? And why are there more police patrolling the area now? 




 "But I love a good mystery too, my darling Lucy."

The sentence that chilled me to my core. Definitely a well written account of what is happening to you OP.

I will say, however, that if it is Lucy, she's a much better actress than you may have every thought possible. Just watch your step. Always remember, keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. See if you can get the sick bastard to bring up another box. The part that gets me is the fact that there were Lucy's hairs with the evidence.

Tread carefully, OP.
