 ah yes, was hoping for something like this :) 









 What if a consumer wants to own two watches?  You know, because fashion... 




 Glad somebody else sees this.  Putting the computer on the wrist is analogous to what happened with watches over a century ago when they moved from the pocket to the wrist.  I can only imagine there were similar Luddites back then who complained along the same lines..."why do I need a clock on my wrist when I have it in my pocket?" 




 Kinda reminds me of the "Other Music" skit starting Aziz Ansari from a few years back, except that skit was actually funny
