 Kick-Ass was Icon, which is owned by Marvel. 




 Fuck that noise. Football stadiums should be loud. 




 Iggy wasn't even mentioned until he did. 




 In fairness on the engagement ring, that was his idea. If you want to wear an engagement ring to show you're engaged, you should either wear it or no. Don't go half ass. 




 At least a few years ago there was free food after most home games in the lafun ballroom with games and stuff to try to keep people from drinking. 




 Indiana still has a shot!

 Tommy also managed to fumble without being hit.

 Both.

 Michigan playing catch up ball on the timeouts. 




 Get used to it. 




 That first scene, though. 




 I also feel like they're more likely to be blond. 




 People who don't understand the genius of Wayne, 2Chainz, and Juicy J.

 Who doesn't want a coach that can go to bowl games as an assistant? 




 Navy has to be the most consistently underrated team in college football. 




 Or the military. 




 Car crash cancer is a serious issue.

 That's not people misunderstanding the movie though. 




 That song gives me ptsd. 




 Do you even internal rhyme? 




 I mean there's easier majors but you're going to have to do a decent amount of work no matter what your major is.   




 Nothing compared to the Katies though. 




 Knott was definitely one of the more lax dorms though. Was with Brojo anyway, not sure what it would be like this year. 




 They don't like Kevin Hart but they like Carlos Mencia? 




 Someone's never listened to Jessie J. She pretty explicitly says it's not about the money. 




 Pants on the Ground is a pretty solid song though. 




 The fact that we were playing in the worst national TV matchup ever that wasn't Army-Navy was pretty bad that year, too. At least we beat Duke in that game. 




 Does he not know how old he is? 




 How do you not like the line "When it Waynes it pours"? 




 If you go opening weekend most people will stay. I saw Cap 2 the 2nd weekend and almost everyone left when the credits started. 




 You can do it in closer to 3 or 3 and a half now that you don't have to go through Kokomo anymore. 




 The O.C. had an awesome theme song. 




 The Topanga would be a decent name for a ship. 




 He landed on both feet! 




 He was upper middle class once he got on Degrassi. He lived in a pretty poor neighborhood for most of his childhood and was in a nicer one later because his mom was renting part of a house there and going in to debt doing it. 




 So we're talking about Miley when we say making a teen a pop star? Because they've been doing that for a while. 




 At what age did you still have to be at the bottom? Drake wasn't exactly rich growing up. He was 15 when he got on Degrassi. Is it only starting from the bottom if you were still poor when you were 18? 




 Nah, all Devin Hester all day. 




 The one and only Yeezus. 




 Probably Beer 30. 




 Love Actually's gotta be up there. 




 You say no to ratchet pussy, Juicy J can't! 




 Which is funny because the big knock on Oden coming out wasn't his injury history at all, it was people questioning whether he liked basketball enough. 




 I particularly enjoyed some of his other work, like "White People Who Attack Other Whites For Racism Are Hypocrites." 




 So any genre that has rock in the title is ok? So I can keep listening to my Limp Bizkit because it's rock-rap? 




 Probably George Gipp. The Four Horsemen weren't too much later though. 




 What's the point in calling yourself a 90s baby? If you want a title, call yourself a millennial and get over yourself. 




 How dare they try to be creative instead of just learning how to spout something back. 




 I do miss when swimming babies made music. 




 People make these jokes because no one seems to understand the concept of internal rhymes. 




 As great as the South Park episode was, it's nowhere near as funny as the real Trapped in the Closet. 




 White and Nerdy got a ton of play. 




 It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne. 




 The best part of this is that it's a cover song. 




 Including all of NWA but DJ Yella? What'd he do? 




 Charlie Sheen, fashion icon. The man who wore nothing but bowling shirts and cargo shorts for 10 years on tv. 




 I think a lot of that could be attributed to Mourdock. After all his debates Republican polling numbers started tanking in every race in the state. 




 They're Backup College for a reason. 




 We also didn't have a 1st or 2nd that year. 




 Couple of comments there. Fighting Irish being chosen was by the Irish at ND as a way of owning negative stereotypes the media had given them. Also, that's a leprechaun, which is a fictional creature, not an actual Irish person. 




 Snoop and PSY skipping with old Korean ladies is probably one of the greatest things I'll ever see on youtube. 




 How can you be born in le wrong generation for a band still coming out with music? 




 And 40s comics were fucking awful. As corny as they could be in the 60s and 70s, 40s comics were straight up propaganda. 




 I don't know what you're talking about, no one won the Heisman that year. 




 And even, for example, The Other Guys was a pretty smart movie. I mean, yes, it was a comedy, but it was also a pretty well done take on Madoff and other Ponzis. 




 Back when the NBA went 10 rounds, the Clippers took Tony Gwynn. Hell, until 1974, they just drafted until there was no one left to draft. 




 People saying he's nothing like Bieber for this clearly have never heard Foolish Pride. 




 Plus everyone grows up to be lifelong Indianapolis Indians fans if I'm to believe the radio commercials. 




 So he knows how to look up his ip in the CMD prompt? 




 A friend of mine's song with his girlfriend was Sexy Bitch. Always laughed at that one. 




 It's the same as how we had "Emma" in Origins who was Emma Frost until they decided to use her in First Class. 




 Rocky IV isn't even montages. It's the only movie I've ever seen be a clip show.

 Hey now, Michelle Branch had at least 2 hits. 




 On the bright side he's on pace to break the single season no decision record. 




 How often do straight couples smash cake on each other during the NFL draft? That was the only part he complained about. He was fine with the kiss. 




 In fairness at least that was back when ND was good. 




 It was right at the beginning, but Bogut? 




 All part of their plan to put players around Lebron. 




 You know, all those people starting psychology projects a week before graduation. 




 You mean they didn't want to draft someone who's having a reality show about his wedding already? 




 In fairness, he ends up accidentally looking at the men in her family more than her.

 Plus posting a question with a link for that karma grabbing. 




 Time for New England to trade up and draft Manziel to replace Brady. 




 As great as the movie was, I thought the Broadway show was even better. Definitely a much lighter show, too.

 Most of Whedon's shows have taken a little while to get going. 




 Well Cornell College is already a thing.
