 Thanks! 




 Turned out much better than I expected. Learned a lot from watching my mom sew when I grew up.  




 Thanks! It's a really cute fabric!!  




 Thank you! I'm thinking I took "high waisted skirt" a little too literally, but it doesn't look proportionate if I were to fold over the waistband.  




 Good advice! It is a Singer 6412. Will have to look online for the manual so I don't miss any moving parts. How often should I oil it?  




 Thanks! I got it from hobby lobby. Was just thinking I should have written down the brand. Good luck with yours! Mine was fun. PLENTY of inconsistencies because I'm a beginner, but with the help of the video, it was pretty easy.
