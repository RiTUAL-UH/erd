 Dankerino.  
First Marui? 




 I think it's horrible lol 




 ayy 




 Vorpie is king weab.  
He guides us all.  




 I'm a hardcore realist and hold few strong beliefs to myself.  
Indifference is my friend and my enemy. 




 I think it's horrible lol 




 Because it's meta and edgy and funny.  
Something like that. 




 I'm very indifferent and can play devils advocate to whether it's great or bad.

 G3 MASER RACE 




 Le meta reddit may mays 




 I wish that they'd keep Okabe's hair down in Zero, like the Epigraph series. I feel like it'd solidify the whole "dropping the Hououin Kyouma" thing 




 \Still just an SA58 and not an FN FAL 




 Oh yeah I forgot about how he kills her the first time and then he goes back and gets the message. Alright, thanks. This is exactly what I needed. 




 Awesome.

Thanks. 




 It was an interesting dynamic to see him suppressing the urge to put on the Kyouma act during the Epigraph series.

I hope they incorporate it in the new series. 




 Ha. When I had six guns I felt like that.  
Now my walls are covered. 




 Sounds cool. And so I'm right on the part about how all of the events of Steins;Gate Zero and Epigraph stuff happens when he denies Amane? 




 So it's mostly him coming to terms with what he has to do and braving psychological torment? 




 I **love** Cowboy Bebop. It's definitely in my top five. 




 So I just finished my ninth rewatch of Steins;Gate.  
Or, I should say I watched it to episode 22, before he saves Kurisu and it sort of "ends" so to speak.

So this is where the question comes in.  
I started reading/read all of the available Steins;Gate Epigraph stuff of whatever when he's got major PTSD and stops pretending to be Hououin Kyouma.

From my understanding, does the events of the Epigraph stuff/Steins;Gate Zero happen when he declines Amane's offer to save Kurisu in episode 23 of the first season?

Then I'm assuming does this follow a world line where he decides to kick his ass back into being Hououin Kyouma?  
Or does it revolve around his darker side and his traumatic experiences from the first season?  
I hope the latter is the case because delving deeper into his psyche and how he was affected (like in the Epigraph stuff) sounds really really interesting.

Any insight would be awesome. Thanks.

 




 Sure 




 Weab shit with a twist 




 Nice. Good luck 




 Question though, what about how the M249 feed tray is for 5.56 and HK21 is 7.62? 




 Cool. You have to post pictures when you're done, I'm excited to see this 




 Because it shoots straight like a ray lol  
Nah I forgot the original reason, it was something like that 




 *Nice.*  
How would you mount it? 




 It's actually all stripped down to just the outer barrel, buffer tube is gone, and it's painted up and ready for new externals 




 Looks like masking tape lol 




 Ha. This is worse than my [shit shooter.] (http://i.imgur.com/x3qABF3.jpg) 




 It'd be cool to modify it permanently. CA G3 parts aren't as hard to find as I thought. 









 Did you model on an SG1 style G3 and then add the furniture and modify the place the magazine goes to look liike an HK21? 




 HK21..?  
Airhard? 




 yee 




 Everybody should share/know the glory of the G3 master race. 




 If you want in then you can get in lol 




 Yeah they said they were switching to the shitty one, so I said I'd pay half so they didn't 




 Yeah, I pay half of the internet bill so they don't change to the shittier provider 




 I'm a teenager and I don't live by myself lol  
I have to pay phone, car insurance, and internet so airhard is hard to buy lol 




 Shock? 




 Request sent 









 Lol if you want in you can  




 If you want in you can just say lol 




 G3 MASTER RACE 




 G3 MASTER RACE 




 ^^^^^^Do ^^^^^^it. 




 I found a metal body, cocking tube, and everything for only about $250. Not too bad at all. 




 Get midcaps..? 




 How loud is your loudout 




 Do it. Do it. DO IT. **DO IT.** 




 Awwww shit son G3 master race.  
Building me a G3 myself. 




 Do it. G3 best raifu 




 Just clicked. It's the Wii shop music.  




 It's from something on the Wii. The music is bugging me because I remember it but not what it's from. 




 Just joined the average club.  
Also you need to comment a description. 




 There is no scientific basis for luck or karma if that's what you're implying. They probably won't suffer any repercussions, and will lead their careers with this guy pushed far back into their minds.

It's nice to think that people who do horrible things will always be punished, but that's not the case at all.  




 Alright, any term for the little thingy?  
Also nice gun, I almost considered an HK51 or short G3 variant, but then I decided long G3 is just too damn sexy lol 




 Alright, will do lol 




 Thanks for the info 




 Yeah I was thinking 200-250  




 Nice 




 I love bandit cichlids lol  
I had one in my old tank 




 I just need a bayonet... 




 I have a CQB gun, this is going to be a le dmr build 




 Whoa dude that's funny, I have a rule for myself and limit orders to be under 500.

Also you should post your tanks here. 




 One tank, eight guns, ordering parts and new gun in two weeks, and saving on the side for new tank. Too much lol 




 Ha 




 Oh yeah man lol.  
Before airsoft I had aquariums and then aquariums petered out with getting into airsoft. 




 I heard that the way clown knife's tails work they don't need as much room to turn as say, a gar or other large fish. 




 I cycled it and looked everything up after someone linked it.  
I also know everything about the clown knife now after watching a crap ton of videos and reading a crap ton of stuff. I compiled a word document with all of my plans.

I'm planning to get a 200 gallon tank, a canister filter, and an internal filter 




 So I could buy some sort of GP drop in gear box, put on the G3 selector, put in G3 trigger, and it'd be good? 




 Alright, so I've been getting ready to build a shiny new G3. I have a list of questions and other things to help me clear stuff up. The base build will be a JG G3 and I already have a cart of metal body parts ready.  
Now, the internals are a different story.

On BingoAirsoftWorks, he mentioned that the G3 used a standard M4 nozzle, and I noticed how the G3 uses a V2 gearbox. The only exception of course is the selector plate, I think.  
Is this true/will this work if I can just drop in a new V2 gearbox and a new selector plate ([like this](http://www.evike.com/products/25893/))?

Next, would be the hop up unit. I haven't the slightest clue what it uses. I have a JG G3 already, but I can't tell what it is. Google isn't too helpful when it comes to G3's.

I think that's the brunt of my questions, and any help would be awesome.

Quickish edit: I think I have everything I need with the exception of a motor.  
Here's a quick list,  
[Nozzle] (http://www.evike.com/products/25970)  
[Selector plate] (http://www.evike.com/products/25893)  
[Gearbox] (http://www.evike.com/products/24818)  
[Trigger] (http://www.evike.com/products/35885)

Only thing left I need is a motor, which I am clueless on 




 Nice. HK master race unite.

My picture quality was kind of shit because I used the picture setting on my video camera. I also have an MP5k, but he's in the SMG corner.
 




 It could be a gas block?  
On [my G36] (http://i.imgur.com/GvKEof6.jpg) there's a gas block a little ways from the flashhider.  




 Aw shit son I got me an [HK wall too!] (http://i.imgur.com/aQXgQG2.jpg) 




 Thank you for this comment.  
Actually if you want a little update, I returned the Oscar and the Pictus and got an oranda red cap gold fish for now.

As for my future plans I'm building an aquarium for a clown knife fish, and then the ten gallon I have now will become a feeder fish tank. 




 It's just observation though. It's a cool loadout and a nice kit, but not unique. 




 I'm not giving him shit. I was saying that it's not unique lol 




 I know that it's not a 551 or a 552. I know that it's Sig's take on an AR pattern rifle. I'm just saying that it's pretty much a 551 or 552 that takes M4 mags. It even resembles it.  
That's all I was saying lol 




 I was just saying it's essentially just a sig 551 or 552 with an M4 mag. 




 My username is mwdh27 if you want in 




 Probably.  
There's **a lot** of people who have cliche skull half masks and OD chest rigs. 




 [More reliable retailer than the one another dude linked.] (http://shop.ehobbyasia.com/tokyo-marui-mk23-socom-fixed-slide-full-set-pistol.html)  
I'm 97% sure that they ship to the UK. 




 Sig 516 is pretty much just a modified Sig 551 or 552 that takes STANAG magazines. It isn't even related to HK. 




 You could say good beginner kit.  
This looks like average beginner gear. 




 This isn't unique though 




 We thought it'd be funny, and nobody cared 




 Taco pizza baby.

Also everybody ignores that sign and I drink coffee lol 




 AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 




 I rarely skip the OP and ED of shows too.  
This show I just skipped it. Too boring. 




 I enjoyed it, but it was hard to look past the shitty development and harem stuff/fan service.  
If a second season comes out I'll watch it, but I don't really care if they don't make another season.

Also the OP and ED were shit. 




 *GoPros plural. Oopsy poopsy. 









 I wasn't trying to circle jerk by any means or be a jerk, I was just curious

 I figure my 8 guns make a decent pile, and a pile of 10 G3's would be a decent pile.  
Of course, I need to win :'^( 




 For me it's here (imma mud bois), /r/airsoft, /r/anime, and a few others I can't think of lol 




 yey 




 JG G3 SG1 is like 120 and discounted it's cheaper. Factoring in discount I'd say that's 10 or so. 




 rip in kill 




 Is there scientific proof that praying does anything besides making people feel better? 




 I unsubbed from pretty much all of the main ones.

 I've concluded that G3's are my favorite HK raifu 




 I'm glad to see we aren't following pointless trends.  




 I promised /u/DaCrate that if I win the $1000 then I'll buy a pile of G3's and post of picture of me swimming in them. 

Crossing my fingers boys. 




 I think it sucks the chick got fired, but I also think /r/iama sucks dick.  
There are no interesting ama's anymore, and it's all just advertising upcoming movies and celebrities. 




 There is nothing online about the KGB using it.  
In another comment, I linked another site that lists historical users. 




 It's somewhere in the sewer system lol
