 A ruthless maglomaniac who is in love with death.  




 now that was an episode!!!!!!!!!!  




 I was SOOO happy!!!!!!!  




 oh yeah  




 Oh yeah  




 Ledgers The Joker  




 Youve most likely seen it but Heath ledger as the Joker.  




 I wouldnt mind a sequel to see what else happens in that.  




 John c Reilly  




 Adam sandler in Reign Over Me 




 Yeah he was pretty good in that one.  




 it would be really cool.  




 HAHAHAHHAA this is so perfect!!!!!!!!!!!  




 Too late LOL  




 yeah I liked it, good performance by ryan reynolds and I laughed so much at some of the dark stuff.  




 So Friday after work I got on the bus it was an earlier one because I got out of work early, anyways I get on and see this nice brown haired girl talking to some old guy they chat for a few stops then santa claus leaves and I think "I should ask her for her number" literally as I am about to get up and talk to her some other older guy starts chatting with her!!!!! I am so pissed why is he talking to her he is like 60 and she is like 22. I hear her give him her number and he gets off the bus I am about to finally make my move but then the bus stops and she gets off too!!!! I was tempted to follow her but it didnt happen I was so cheesed off LOL. I will ride that same bus again soon and see if she is on there I think I overheard her say she was going to work. Just wanted to say that and stuff.  




 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH  




 I really want to see it cant wait!!!!!!  




 IDK a better villain maybe and Oliver finally back as the arrow.  




 Oh now I get it thank you.  




 it looks interesting I liked the movie and glad its becoming a show plus Cooper appearing is even better.  




 I didnt like it that much, it has some good scenes but Im not sure if it was trying to be scary or a very bad thriller.  




 It was really good im glad a few of my least favorite characters were finally killed.  




 When the guy from Armageddon tortures that kid in the 2004 Punisher movie I just cannot watch that part at all.  




 Yeah most likely.  




 That one too  




 Artificial Intelligence, I have only seen it like 4 times because every time I have cried at the very end.  




 He is still a good actor wish he was A list again.  




 I still wish Gibson had returned  




 BOOO Thats too long!!!!! 




 Yeah I'm reading the stand right now I have been for awhile once I'm done with that one I will read it.  




 Hes alright I liked him as Scott Pilgrim Im glad he is getting better bigger roles now too.  




 Yeah I figured god was she something though!!!! Wish I could have snapped a picture or something but they said no cell phones.  




 yeah I saw that I watched the miniseries when I was younger and it scared me ive been meaning to finally read the book too I just have a lot on my plate.  




 So last night I went to a strip club for the first time ever!!!!! I was bored and theres one I always see close to my house I go there and I am completely overwhelemned!!!! So many HOTTIES half naked!!!! Anyways after a few drinks and at least 25 dollar bills tipped I asked this really HOT dancer named Jordan for a private dance in the VIP room, it was 20 dollars to get in and then 20 per song. We go in the back and she immedietely grabbed me in the crotch (keep in mind too that I was very drunk by this time LOL). She danced all over me and I felt her EVERYWHERE!!!!! I am still trying to remember all of the positions she was in LOL, we talked about random stuff too like her job and my job a few other things. She had this awesome tattoo on her back too like angel wings a few others too. She danced for 3 songs so it was 60 dollars (I got a raise at work recently thats why I treated myself I was gonna buy a PS4 but did this instead LOL) I was so tempted to go back there today and get another one from that sexy goddess but I couldnt really afford it. I will return there again though and get 3 more songs from that beauty!!!!! I remember carrying her briefly with her legs wrapped around me that was nice. I just had to tell someone this since I dont want to tell my family and all of my friends seem to never answer my texts anymore LOL, oh man I can still feel her grip on my crotch.  




 How scary is he??? Honestly if he didnt scare the shit out of you when you were younger I dont know what did.  




 Yeah I watched it all in a month on netflix I LOVED IT, i dont understand why it never lasted, I wish they made a movie about it since the cast are all well known now.  




 Ender  




 The Dark Knight, it is still my fasvorite movie trailer ever!!!!  




 Yeah it sounds about right.  




 I read somewhere that since Ultron had Tony Starks personality traits then that means if left unchecked Tony can be as ruthless and eveil as Ultron was, and that will come into play in CA Civil war.  




 I think they will just focus on other heroes down the road and stuff I dont see a complete reboot of the MCu happening any time soon.  




 Sad news.  




 They should have just called it Marvels Civil War.  




 HAHAHA so funny!!!!!!!  




 Raimis 4, by Far. I would even sell my soul to the devil himself to have seen that get made.  




 WOW this guy is really not gonna stop talking about marvel LOL.  




 Probably the weirdest choice ever, I would see him as that bully maybe but not the deranged clown, its so weird too because I was watching were the millers the other day and I thought "I wonder if this kid will go anywhere???" .  




 AHHHH Man Ben Mendelson would have been great!!!!!  




 Just give her a role like she had in the avengers just be seen for one or two scenes.  




 That would be mine too.  




 I think it was all real, how else would she get out of that locked room and how did her mother suddenly get better.  




 Season 9 is one of the best seasons IMO. I like the new look for the show and yes Oneill is gone and I missed him but the new characters are good too, youll like season 10 even better.  




 I really wouldnt have minded to have seen 2 quicksilvers over the years, instead it was a one time thing.  




 Yeah I kinda wish it was him instead of Kickass I mean we just met him and he dies in the same film Hawkeye we have known for a few films.  




 The great gatsby.  




 I liked it a nice underrared comedy/horror film.  




 The Avengers when Iron Man arrives and knocks Loki to the ground I ALWAYS get goosebumps at that part, also the end battle when they are all stand together.  




 It most likely is, I am also watching it in IMAX and I cant wait to see that trailer in IMAX!!!!!  




 WOW I didnt know there was already a movie of this.  




 Girl  




 Jumanji style adventure sounds interesting.  




 I missed the Marvel Marathon I wont miss this one.  




 UGH I knew i should have went.  




 exactly.  




 I wish they would make one with a proper Mandarin but it will likely never happen.  




 That used to creep me out when ZI was younger, now it is just a good dose of nostalgia.  




 Cuz he has a new job as the doctor of a top secret prison that is in the middle of the ocean.  




 Yeah......................Yeah  




 Jackie Chan possibly in an Expendables movie.  




 I hate agreeing with you.  




 It was also stupid  




 Yeah I really liked it too a nice dark comedy like you said, I just wish it had a better ending.  




 UGH dont get me started on her.  




 Okay  




 Forgive me, forgive me for being human.  




 So a few years ago I was at a party at my friends house and one of his friends Rachel invited a whole bunch of her friends and we all got wasted or at least buzzed I remember this girl I met Justine she showed an interest in me and all of my buds were telling me I should make a move on her I did and we started making out on the couch I actually thought I was going to get laid but then her friend said she was leaving and she left but she gave me one last kiss on the cheek and said "I have a boyfriend". I was a little upset cause she just used me but I also wish I could see her again I never saw her again except one time on the train when I was going to work I waved at her but she pretended not to notice me. Anyways sometimes I look up her FB profile to see what she is up to, she never accepted my request either. I just wanted to make this known.  




 Yeah hes still a good actor and I have always liked him, I honestly dont think he can become an a lister again though he is too far gone.  




 Yeah palpatine always thought of him as a waste due to his injuries he wanted to replace him with luke as fast as he could. just like how he replaced Dooku with Anakin.  




 How awesome would it be if it was that.  




 So Mrs Fug is good in it huh??? I might see it then.  




 Okay thanks  




 Good for them they shouldnt have to subject themselves to this kind of crap.  




 Its not just Very close in front of my face it is usually everything within three feet.  




 Amen.  




 I want nat wolf he seems like a good fit for peter and spiderman but Asa is a good actor and I would love to see him too, oh god just annouce it already so we can stop this!!!!  




 I always get a large Soda and Large Popcorn along with Red Vines although it is not always Red Vines sometimes I will try something else but yeah I am like you if I am in a cinema and I dont have something to munch on throughout the movie then I feel weird, I have actually gone to great lengths to get a snack for a movie. Also at certain theaters that I go to I usually order some cheese sticks man those are freakin delicious!!!!  




 So as far as I can remember I see double whenever something is up close like my finger or a pencil I know a normal person would see something in front of their face that is just single but I see it as double all the time no matter how far away it is. For example is someone puts their hand in front of my face I would see two hands and a normal person would see only one. What is wrong with my eyes?? I am 22 years old and 6 foot and 2 inches.  




 I would give Hulk a sequel in phase two and have Ed Norton be Banner in all films. I would also switch Antman so it is released before Avengers Ultron so Antman can appear in the sequel also make Pym the creator of Ultron of course.  




 Is this guy best friends with whoever runs FX or something???  




 He was on like 2 episodes and they made it seem like he was the baddest motherfucker ever LOL.  




 Oh yeah LOL its on my birthday too I cant think of a better birthday present then that.  




 The best theater experience I have ever had was probably The Avengers. I remember rushing to the theater after work that day and waiting in line for an hour I get in the theater and choose probably the best seat in that stadium like theater. It was so packed and as the movie went on I loved it, I remember when Coulson died I jumped and some lady behind me shouted "Damit Joss". Also the Puny God moment I dont think I have heard a laugh like that in a theater in so long LOL!!!! I wish I could relive that day again.  




 UGH I wish I had seen it in IMAX I was jobless at the time though and by the time I got a job and money The Hobbit had already started playing, to make up for it I saw it in a regular theater in one of the first few rows.  




 M O N E Y  




 Remember reading those in grade school and the images would always scare me of course LOL, I dont remember most of the stories though just the pictures, I remember one that really got to me was called Harold about a scarecrow that came to life or something.  




 I assume because it is not too long for production and it only takes a few months, that way they can reach their mark of yearly and stuff. I kinda wonder what it would be like if they released them 20 episodes at a time.  




 Yeah true.  




 Leo Dicaprio in Django the scene where he slams his hand on the table is so awesome!!!!  




 Indeed he was I was so hoping he would pull an upset on Oscar night but it was Daniels year.  




 It makes sense it wouldnt have done that good in the summer.  




 Yes indeed. 




 I liked it a good adaptation of the novel I havent seen the swedish ones yet but I will soon. I wish they would make a sequel.  




 If Mel Brooks can get one going he would be awesome to see in a movie again!!!!!  




 Jessica Chastain  




 Look up how to make your own on Youtube I was gonna do that!!!!  




 MMMMM I loved those!!!!!  




 I would have said that instead of Killing Jury he just cuts ties with the indian hills charter due to his anger, and lets say Unser calls the cops before jax gets to the house so she is locked up and jax is deprived of his revenge but he does get to kill Marks and Barofsky just not publicly and so Gemma spends the rest of her life in prison on death row never sees jax or the boys again and Jax finally leads the club into a legit direction. 
  




 I know but still I just didnt want him to die LOL especially like that.  




 Just saw it and I LOVED IT!!!!! Granted I had my doubts but I am glad that I went.  




 all of them theres no question.
