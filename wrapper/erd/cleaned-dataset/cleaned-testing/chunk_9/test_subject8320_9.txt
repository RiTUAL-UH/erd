 liam why ;_; 




 I heard it in a mix angerfist did recently all I can remember was a guy laughing and saying "were going to kill so many people" sorry for the vagueness  




 /u/audiofrq estimated release date plz you are reverse bass king (do a reverse bass master class some time)  




 It's cool, the thing I like about Speedcore is how caotic it is. I'm talking Quarter, 8th and 16th note drum rolls at random, not knowing what to expect next, things like that. My advice is warm your self up to it. Start at a lower tempo like 155-200 then move up to 210-220 I did that for an entire day and it felt really weird but the next day I found a new appreciation for Speedcore and I could listen to anything, even Extratone. If and when you start to like Speedcore check out psycho filth records they are a lable based in Japan and they are my favorite Speedcore lable (they released this song). If you need help finding songs that fall under certan BPM ranges just let me know and I'll help you find some :) 
























 It's a pretty nice little app, kind of limited but I'm expecting that to change soon 




 That was fantastic! so many gay men I love it love it love it! 




 TODAY IS SUCH A GREAT DAY!!!! LOVE TO EVERYONE!! 




 TFW you haven't gotten to any of these guys on normal ;_; 




 was that actually him?! his arms look a lot like Danny's (that's pretty much the only thing you can identify him by) 




 lets see how far raving has come! [I'll start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM-r9sbCvJw) 




 I would expect nothing less from SP's little brother, this track is a lot of fun  









 the big OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! from the bug island LP 









 That's probably because you've never heard predator before ;)  














 deadmau5 - 16th hour (mmmmmmm.... Stepping out of the rain into a club drenched in blue light)

[Here's the artists Pixiv NSFW](http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?id=2991 type=all p=13) 









 because its about stapling tape worms to your penis and it sounds like someone shoving a sharp jagged piece of metal into their skull. (POS - I staple tapeworms to my penis)      














 Cuttteeeee!!! 




 If Gensokyo is anything like some of the pics people draw of it then sign me right the fuck up for the next gate to it! 









 ohhhh... that makes sense, thank you  









 man I love this kind of art style! flat colors and characters with very defined outlines, reminds me of [Brian lee o'mally's art style](http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/seconds.jpg) 









 "don't always have power" pfff.... 




 *sniff* gentlemen it has been an honor

 DYK? Srezcat = Kobaryo  














 can we just take a minuet to appreciate how cool the cover art for this album is?! 









 crossbreed is a combination of DnB and Hardcore its fucking radical and you can treat it as a gateway into industrial and mainstream hardcore 




 Fuck yes I can! Mindustries, The Outside Agency (AKA DJ Hidden and Eye-D the creators of crossbreed) AK Industry, Counterstrike, Lowroller, Sinister Souls, Deathmachine and N-Viral. TBH I dont know a lot of artists because I'm still kind of new to the genre, check out Genosha Recordings/Genosha One Seven Five (The Outside Agency's lables) and Tainted Audio (DJ Ruffneck's lable)       














 3 japan is the best country in the world, so much better then the land of baka gaijins called America /s (but not really /s because japan is super awesome!) 




 Me too! He's also really good at drawing characters who look like they are about to loose it/have lost it  












































 I seriously have a problem when it comes to J-Core, I have so much of it on my computer  


































 I've been posting a lot of Japanese hardcore lately, I'm going to balance it out with some Dutch and Italian stuff  









 37, my "wife" sucked 37 dicks  




 by mix I mean DJ mix, but I should look that up and see if that exists!

EDIT: Holy shit it dose!! [Its really good!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flSENzmRTAQ) 




 I'm not great with multi genre mixes so two genres at max! let me know what you would like to hear!
 









 [try this one](https://soundcloud.com/daataa/mitch-murder-guiles-theme) 









 nano when are you going release sugarplum fortress? Also ya it is, but it's cool, cntrl+c cntrl+v ;) 




 Do it! I need more Psytrance in my life 














 I just want to do a quick [victory screech](http://youtu.be/fC1nVcShPqo) because the three things I posted last night have a combined total of 28 karma! It hasn't been easy pushing the harder side of stuff and at points I thought "what's the point?" But I'm glad I stuck with it 




 TBH I would totally see a deadmau5 musical if it was in good hands 




 I hate his name so much but he is currently the cutest producer on the planet RN  




 I'm so pissed I can't go ;_; say hi to M-Project for me and be sure to take lots of pictures 




 Chiafriend gave you a good list but I'm going to give you mine (just so you have more!) 

[Darren Styles - Come running](http://youtu.be/YsN2VoZRUUQ)

[nanobii - Rainbow Road](http://youtu.be/a0Aauep0VWs)

[DJ Noriken - Elektrikshot](http://youtu.be/3besSki3pHQ)

[DJ Genki - Candy Star](http://youtu.be/YvH0egVfx_o) 




 Yep! 





























 When I realized I had listening to arangements more then my normal Dutch, Itaian and UK Hardstyle/Hardcore (moro if you browse this sub never stop making music you beautiful SOB) 




 I feel bad for Alice, that mustard must burn like hell  




 "*not sure if this is the best place to put*" bro this is /r/touhou we thrive on dank memes 




 Mario Kart 8, Bayonetta 2, Smash Bros, Wonderful 101 and now Fatal Frame are all reasons I need to get a Wii U (I love japanese horror) also holy shit this pic is what nightmares are made of, imagine being chased through a house by that and every time you look back you see those eyes ;_; someone please post a cute awoo I freaked myself out 









 I feel like a little gnome is down voting everthing I post :/ won't stop me though! DO YOU HERE ME GNOME!?!? YOU CANT STOP THE HARDCORE!!! 














 part of break out black (MNK's album) it was released along side break out white (USAO's album) check them both out they are really good!  









 round round wave wave crushhherrrr. His earlier releases focused more on speed more then anything else, the turning point was his album doujin or death! it was fucking fantastic and his releases have just gotten better and better  




 mmmmm...... Their are a lot of nostalgic things in this world, and a echoey gituar is one of them  














 Na, I'm just a highschooler who loves Jojo's bizzare adventure :) 




 From a app called yo shirt! It's expesive I'm not going to lie but it's really cool because you can turn ANY picture into a screen print shirt, theirs no desktop site and it's only on iPhone (so if you don't have an iPhone your out of luck sorry) [heres a shirt I made with some cool album art](http://m.imgur.com/nxBv0kA) 




 I've been posting a lot of songs by moro lately, but that's because I just love him so much! 









 Tnx b

 Mmmmm.... Those pancakes looked really good 




 ^^^ahhh ^^^noooo ^^^stop 









 this is a cover for a really good [orchestral album](http://mtcd0014.tumblr.com/) 














 Mark meer walks out on stage, says we'll bang ok, ME4 logo fades in behind him, crowd goes wild

EDIT: oh shit.... I just realized, another ME means more gamer poop vids!! 




 ATM no :( I can kind of help you though :) ok first set your DAW too 300 BPM (Speedcore starting tempo) double the beat grid if you want to go to 600! Ok now you need a kick, sample, make or find one in a sample pack (I'll post a sample pack if you want 3) play around with EQing and distortion to really give the kick that personal touch! I don't know a lot about song structure but I will say this. BE SURE TO BREAK IT UP listening to a 4x4 kick pattern for a long time at high tempos will give even the most resilient listener a massive head ache so be sure to break it up with 8th and 16th stutters. As for the rest of the things ask around and message some of your favorite artists you'll be surprised who wrights back :)          









 It takes a lot to fix a heart..... (Fuck can't think of any good parody lyrics) 














 Then she would say "bak- I mean idiot! Your just jelous of my devotion too a new culture!" 














 Bra I'll post more 3
