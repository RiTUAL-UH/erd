 I know I post here a lot, and I usually post here about stuff that isn't exactly psychotic but related to schizophrenia, so sorry if it annoys anyone. 

Lately I've been feeling disconnected with the world, and especially with other people, I sometimes go to the store with my mum and stuff and it feels like everything is amplified (as in sounds and stuff) but everyone just feels alien to me. It kinda just feels like the world is passing me by, a good way to explain it is it's kinda like when you see people in movies and they're just standing there and everyone around them is going super fast, if you have ever seen that in a movie.

Has anyone else felt like this? It's pretty strange and I think the only other times I felt it was years ago during pre psychosis, and it may have happened during psychosis but I can't fully remember. 
 




 Woah, you must be like 14 and been on the internet for sooooo long.  




 Just because the Jews don't believe in the new testament doesn't mean they don't believe in the same god. Like /u/Merari01 said -  Well. Yes. That's why Judaism, Christianity and Islam are all Abrahamic religions. They all worship the god of Abraham. 




 What about increasing taxes on the upper class instead? I'm pretty sure that's what he wants, I mean they do have more money that they hardly use after all. 




 Woah, stop I'm gonna die from all this laughing I'm doing. 




 But if they announced half life 3 the internet would explode. 




 Maybe it's magic??? 




 CARRY ON? STUPID? REDDIT? FUCK YOU!  




 Doesn't cortisol make you less stressed as opposed to making you more stressed? Or is that only when it's regulated normally and does the opposite when it's released too often/too much? 




 Oh good, fuck me right in the ass :D. 




 Vincent will you have my baby? 




 Weed is a brutal gateway drug confirmed? 




 I don't think anyone (other than people who go on the sub) actually like FPH. 




 I hate all you over at /r/fatpeoplehate, it's just a retarded sub. BANNED FOR SYMPATHY. 




 The funny thing is that the UK has  one the highest rates of alcohol abuse in the world. 




 Money - The most addictive drug on earth. 




 Just so people know, schizophrenia doesn't usually cause violence. Anyway, sorry for what happened, must be rough. 




 The war on drugs makes it much worse. Being an alcoholic isn't victimless either, people get damaged severely (mentally and physically) by alcoholics in the household.  




 Are you in fact a gangsta? 




 Actually it's their anti-market and anti-consumer practices. 




 Thanks. I've been having what I think is derealization but I can't say for sure since I'm not exactly a psychiatrist or anything but I'm pretty sure it is, along with insomnia and other stuff. Maybe I should check with my doc again. 




 Is it not illegal to not employ someone because of a mental illness, especially when recovering? 




 Perfect 




 Can you use depersonalization interchangeably with derealization? 




 Even though I'm banned from /r/fatpeoplehate because I said some offensive shit to them, I actually feel bad for them kinda like how MLK felt about racists.  




 You should check out [Sargon of Akkad](https://www.youtube.com/user/SargonofAkkad100) on youtube he usually talks about feminism and is opposed to them. He also talks like a rational human being and not like an extreme, extreme left wing political correctness douche. He's quite centre, instead of left or right. 




 So I've been off of my medication for months now and I just wanted to know what exactly you're warning signs are for a relapse? Or what they might be in general? I've looked at places with varying information so I thought it'd be good to ask here.  




 Is 1 - 100 all that rare though? I wouldn't say it's too rare. 




 Oh, right. Must of misinterpreted what you said. 




  and a more educated population

Are you saying europe is uneducated or what? 




 You go on fat people hate... That's all I have to say. 




 The word shitlord makes me cringe beyond belief. 




 This guy is a conspiracy theorist and friends with Alex Jones (I think). 




 But the only swear word you seem to say is shit. 




 Is your favourite word 'shit' or something? 




 Yep, that's true. Around 10%ish, even though it's not fully agreed upon (some say more). But that's not exactly what I was saying in my comment. 




 Only way he could download and play that fast is if he had google fiber. 




 nO you had bleach. 




 By this person's logic opiates must be completely harmless too. 




 Yeah because /r/opiates doesn't exist. 




 You're being more hostile. Like NO ONE on reddit has been through addiction either... /s 




 What do you mean by controlled? Do you mean control usage or control as in stopping? 




 I'm guessing you go with a different view of addiction? I go with the disease model because that has the most evidence backing it up. 




 EVERYONE START SNIFFING 1 DOLLAR NOTES. 




 I don't think you're an idiot at all. I get what you mean, though.  




 Nice hostility, I think your friends heroin would do you nicely. 




 Funnily enough I'm addicted to morphine. That's a different reason to be addicted but it's still the persons fault to continue using, but after addiction fully sets in then it's out of the person's control for the most part. 




 For most people, yes it is. I know first hand, second hand, third hand and fourth hand. 




 For starting to use a certain drug it's the person's fault yes, but once you're addicted it gets out of your control. 




 Addiction is much, much more than you realise. It's a long term battle, actually, it's pretty much a life long battle. So yes, you can relapse even if you've been clean for months or even years. 




 Can you seriously not take a mild stereotypical joke? Hypocrite. 




  Like when you will see these presence manifest themselves physically then you will have gone full on schizo.

You said this... This is what I'm talking about. It sounds like, to me anyway, that you're saying you need to have visuals in order to be full blown schizophrenic. Maybe I'm mistaking what you meant though. 




 Still, the most common hallucination during active psychosis (psychosis is usually the same, only difference would be the form of delusion) would be audio not visual. Most schizophrenics hear things rather than see things, is what I'm saying. I'm not saying this guy has schizophrenia, I'm just correcting you. 




 You don't need visual hallucinations to have schizophrenia/active psychosis, actually, you don't even need hallucinations to have schizophrenia but the most common are audio during psychosis. Also, schizophrenia is much more than just psychosis. 




 Visual hallucinations do you mean? That's not actually all that common in psychosis. 




 Just wondering, what do you mean by visualise your delusions? Delusions in my experience (looking back) have just been intense thoughts (and obviously using everything that's related to my delusion as confirmation) in a way accompanied by voices. 




 Schizophrenia isn't exactly and old term either I don't think, like mid 100 years old. It's just not my dad either, it's people that I've known before I was ill (I haven't made any new friends in person for around 2 years), I guess the stigma is still very, very much alive sadly. 




 Closer to 5am so they don't give a fuck even more. 




 I thought that he said he would want to kill himself mainly because his quality of life would suffer. Schizophrenia can reduce your quality of life quite a lot and is one of the most disabling conditions to have but he cleared everything up and he meant that he would want to die if he got a disease that makes him forget drastically.  




 I've been struggling with negative symptoms that I can fully recognize but not fully explain properly, life is pretty much difficult day to day. I pretty much just wake up, come on my computer and do that every day, all day unless I have an appointment. My words get mixed up quite a lot etc. you know, the normal stuff. I've been asking my parents to actually research or ask a doctor about schizophrenia to realize that it's pretty much not my fault, yet they don't, they think I'm just being lazy or stupid (they actually say that to me). I've been officially diagnosed btw, so they have no reason to doubt me yet they do. My memory sucks so when I forget things they just tut and say I'm acting stupid, key word, acting. I'm not acting shit, why would I act something for years that's done nothing but fuck with my life (mainly education). I feel like my parents are stigmatizing me in a way and it sucks, I have no one else to talk to and they're my main carers. It's really starting to get to me, it's like I have no real help with anything. At least they put me on disability, only time they recognized that I needed it.

I don't even know if this makes sense, hope it does.

Edit: When I talk about my parents I really mean my dad mainly. 




 Yeah, I get it. I thought you meant you'd want to die because your quality of life would suffer. 




 Most people with schizophrenia won't live normal lives with treatment, a lot do but majority don't. Schizophrenics also sometimes need carers as well. Active psychosis is ranked one of the most disabling conditions right after dementia. 




 Of course they're not the same but schizophrenia is a really, really bad illness when it comes to quality of life. Medications only fix the psychosis not the actually full illness, that's why they're called antipsychotics and not anti-schizophrenics. I've actually heard somewhere that a country(?) or a group of people want there to be some sort of assisted suicide for chronically schizophrenic people, not sure though.

Also, how long does it normally take to die from alzheimer's? 




 Psychosis in a way can take away what was originally you, but you most likely wouldn't chose to die if you had schizophrenia, or would you? Genuine question. 




 I agree, sir. Very shallow and pedannnnntic. 




  ephemerally

Yes, quite, yes. Indeedly. 




 Kurt wasn't in the rehab long enough for his tolerance to go down though. Also, I'm pretty sure his tolerance was higher than what was found in his blood stream. 




 God damn, sorry for your loss. It's even tough to read. Trying to put myself in your position and it's super unimaginable, I couldn't comprehend if I lost my best friend to an OD right next to me. 




 3 times the normal lethal dose, yeah but kurt had a hefty tolerance so of course he could survive that. Some addicts can go up to grams a day. 




 At least his penis looks like it's small as fuck since I can't see it.  




 Perfect. Thought my computer wouldn't load it. 




 Had is starting to sound like an alien word now. 




 Personality disorders are kinda in the grey area of mental illness, I believe. Also, I think I might have just got some words mixed up and that's why I came to that conclusion. 




 If they plea insanity and they do have a severe mental illness like schizophrenia then they usually do serve time in a mental hospital (and they usually serve a lot longer in a hospital than they would in a prison). 




 Isn't ASPD just psychopathy/sociopathy? ASPD is completely different from schizophrenia, ASPD isn't really considered a mental illness if I remember correctly.  




 That's SSRI's for depression. Antipsychotics are for schizophrenia and they block serotonin and dopamine. Depression and schizophrenia are different, when I think of insanity I usually think psychosis because psychosis is basically just the modern term for insanity. 




 I wouldn't say alcohol is better than heroin. Alcohol is pretty hard shit when it comes to long term effects. 




 If it's insanity in the sense of schizophrenia or whatever then the drugs block dopamine and serotonin. 




 I agree that hallucinations are usually false sensory experiences, but I've also heard that voices can be inside the head but they sound like completely different from the persons inner monologue.  




 Teeth grinding isn't a telltale sign of opiate use. It's a tell for stimulant use though (amphetamine, cocaine etc). 




 How would you like it if your mummy got rid of you because she had a new baby? 




  cheesburger* 




 It's kinda the same with me and my parents except once I started to not be as good as they thought they told me how shit I was. Parents who do this probably think they're doing something right, when in reality, they're not. They're in fact building either a narcissist or building them up just to fall, it's sad. 




 Fat shaming campaigns wont do anything. Real information and education is better (without shaming of course telling someone about the health problems would be enough), shaming people that might have problems with overeating is totally counterproductive.  




 So every overweight/obese person spreads lies to justify it? FPH is just a hate sub, nothing more, nothing less. 




 I won't live a miserable life because I don't spend most of it hating on others, you on the other hand... 




 [You seem like a nice human being by the way.](http://i.gyazo.com/fc068507a099f6d0ae61a58e1f999e30.png)

obvious /s. 




 Vincent you aren't neo. 




 Ice Road Truckers is full of ancient history. 




 Codeine is a real drug. It's potency is just weird because some people can't fully metabolize it into morphine (its morphine that gets you high on codeine as well btw, a lot of people don't have the enzymes to produce it in their bodies though). 




 And what's not real about hydro? 




 I had a seizure reading this. 




 It's more toxic to your stomach, cardiovascular system and kidneys than your liver I believe... If I was taking ibuprofen every day I would worry more about my stomach than anything else. 




 I'm pretty sure the liver can feel like it hurts if it gets enlarged and presses on other organs because the outer shell has pain receptors (not 1000% sure though). 




 Do you drink alcohol (or ever drank alcohol)? Simple question. 




 Yeah because liking a comment means you like them romantically.  




 Seroquel got rid of all my symptoms mainly because it's super, super sedating.  




 Indonesia seems like a joke when it comes to legal matters. They'll happily execute someone even if they know she didn't do it. 




 I've fapped on 200mg (snorted ritalin). Albeit it is a mission to get it up. 




 Negative and cognitive symptoms are the worst. Positive symptoms aren't nearly as chronic and debilitating IME. 




 When I'm in the midst of deep, deep apathy, exercise will do nothing for me. 




 Magnification. 




 Troll detected.
