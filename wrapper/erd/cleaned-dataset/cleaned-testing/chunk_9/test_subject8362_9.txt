 That's it. I am deleting my Reddit app. I don't need to come back anymore. It can't get any better than this...





Who am I kidding... Reddit owns me. I'll be back tomorrow. Or in an hour. Or maybe I will just keep browsing for a little bit longer(4-5 hours longer will suffice for tonight). 




 Uh-oh... Careful now. The wrath of Reddit may come down on you for posting a pic of your kid on Reddit. They no likely. I have learned from mistakes.  




 Woman here... This is an insane amount of shit to bring on a trip. Also, do I really see nail polish remover? Who... Who honestly thinks they are going to need nail polish remover while on vacation?

 Hahaha! That kid's face..."Uuugh .. Fuck!" 




 Oh man... I know that feeling all too well! 









 The first time I saw this on Reddit, about 4 different times ago, it took me WAAAY too long to find what was wrong with the picture. That day I hadz the dumbz.
