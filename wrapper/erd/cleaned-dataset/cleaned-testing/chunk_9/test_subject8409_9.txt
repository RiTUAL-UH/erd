 It's in the Statement by the Press Secretary on the Proposed Rescission of Cubas Designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism

In Cubas case, the applicable criteria require the President to submit a report to the Congress **at least 45 days before the
proposed rescission would take effect**, justifying the rescission and certifying that (1) the Government
of Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding 6-month period; 
and (2) the Government of Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international
terrorism in the future.

 **White House on Proposed Lifting of Cubas Terrorism Designation**

---
    14 April 2015

    THE WHITE HOUSE
    Office of the Press Secretary
    Washington, D.C.
    April 14, 2015



    Statement by the Press Secretary on the Proposed Rescission of Cubas Designation as a State Sponsor of
    Terrorism




    Today, the President submitted to Congress the statutorily required report and certifications indicating 
    the Administrations intent to rescind Cubas State Sponsor of Terrorism designation.


    Cuba was designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1982 due to its efforts to promote armed 
    revolution by organizations that used terrorism. Once designated, a country remains a State Sponsor of 
    Terrorism until its designation is rescinded in accordance with statutory criteria. In Cubas case, the
    applicable criteria require the President to submit a report to the Congress at least 45 days before the
    proposed rescission would take effect, justifying the rescission and certifying that (1) the Government
    of Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding 6-month period; 
    and (2) the Government of Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international
    terrorism in the future.


    As part of his December 17, 2014, announcement of policy changes related to Cuba, President Obama
    instructed the Department of State to undertake a review of Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of 
    Terrorism based on an assessment of the available facts. After a careful review of Cubas record,
    which was informed by the Intelligence Community, as well as assurances provided by the Cuban
    government, the Secretary of State concluded that Cuba met the conditions for rescinding its 
    designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. The Secretary of State therefore recommended that the
    President make and submit to Congress the statutorily-required report and certification.


    As the President has said, we will continue to have differences with the Cuban government, but our 
    concerns over a wide range of Cubas policies and actions fall outside the criteria that is relevant to
    whether to rescind Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. That determination is based on
    the statutory standard   and the facts  and those facts have led the President to declare his intention
    to rescind Cubas State Sponsor of Terrorism designation. More broadly, the United States will continue
    to support our interests and values through engagement with the Cuban government and people.

 **Kerry on Proposed Lifting of Cubas Terrorism Sponsor Designation**



    14 April 2015

    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
    Office of the Spokesperson
    Washington, D.C.
    April 14, 2015

    STATEMENT BY SECRETARY KERRY

              Recommendation to Rescind Cubas Designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism


    In December 2014, as a critical component of establishing a new direction for U.S.Cuba relations, the 
    President directed the State Department to launch a review of Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of 
    Terrorism and provide a report to him within six months. Last week, the State Department submitted a 
    report to the White House recommending, based on the facts and the statutory standard, that
    President Obama rescind Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.


    This recommendation reflects the Departments assessment that Cuba meets the criteria established by 
    Congress for rescission. While the United States has had, and continues to have, significant concerns
    and disagreements with a wide range of Cubas policies and actions, these concerns and disagreements 
    fall outside of the criteria for designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. This review focused on the
    narrow questions of whether Cuba provided any support for international terrorism during the previous 
    six months, and whether Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international
    terrorism in the future, consistent with the statutory standard for rescission.


    Circumstances have changed since 1982, when Cuba was originally designated as a State Sponsor of 
    Terrorism because of its efforts to promote armed revolution by forces in Latin America. Our 
    Hemisphere, and the world, look very different today than they did 33 years ago. Our determination,
    pursuant to the facts, including corroborative assurances received from the Government of Cuba and 
    the statutory standard, is that the time has come to rescind Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of
    Terrorism.

 Jeopardizing the lifting of sanctions indicated in the JCPOA  **can** harm the whole nuclear deal.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest indicated **the move could endanger plans to ultimately lift sanctions on Iran as part of a final nuclear deal** (emphasis mine). He says unity and coordination with nations like Russia is critical to the success of the negotiations.

 The Philadelphia Deringer was a small percussion handgun designed by Henry Deringer (17861868) and produced from 1852 through 1868. A popular concealed carry handgun of the era. Deringers sometimes had the dubious reputation of being a favored tool of assassins. 150 years ago on April 14, 1865 John Wilkes Booth used a single-shot Deringer pistol to kill Abraham Lincoln.

  Your pre-JPA link is from November 23, 2013. The JCPOA fact sheet from 2015 does not include  daily access.

 https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/04/02/parameters-joint-comprehensive-plan-action-regarding-islamic-republic-ir

The IAEA **will have regular access** to all of Irans nuclear facilities, including to Irans enrichment facility at Natanz and its former enrichment facility at Fordow, and including the use of the most up-to-date, modern monitoring technologies.

-
This makes it even more confusing.

Edit: The JCPOA fact sheet includes that Iran agrees to the Additional Protocol of the IAEA

Iran has agreed to implement the Additional Protocol of the IAEA, providing the IAEA much greater access and information regarding Irans nuclear program, including both declared and undeclared facilities.

-

This is from the text of the [Additional Protocol](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/infcirc540.pdf)  

(i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii) below, the Agency shall give .......... **advance notice of access of at least 24 hours**; 

-

(ii) For access to any place on a site that is sought in conjunction with design information verification visits or **ad hoc** or **routine inspections** on that site, **the period of advance notice shall, if the Agency so requests, be at least two hours but, in exceptional circumstances, it may be less than two hours**.

 Iran has agreed to reduce by approximately two-thirds its installed centrifuges. Iran will go from having about 19,000 installed today to 6,104 installed under the deal, with only 5,060 of these enriching uranium for 10 years. 

-

Iran will have 6,104 centrifuges installed, not 500 to 1,500 as Washington originally wanted as a ceiling or 4,000 as floated by U.S. officials as a possible compromise. 5,000-6,000 centrifuges is enough for a bomb but not sufficient enough to power a reactor.

Read [The odd reality of Iran's centrifuges: Enough for a bomb, not power](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/25/michael-morell/odd-reality-irans-centrifuges-enough-bomb-not-powe/)

"A ten-fold increase in Irans centrifuge capacity would be required to enrich enough uranium fuel for its Bushehr reactor alone. And no matter how many more centrifuges Iran installs, it can never become self-sufficient because it does not possess adequate uranium ore reserves for a large-scale nuclear energy program."



 All excess centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure will be placed in IAEA monitored storage and will be used only as replacements for operating centrifuges and equipment.

-

Iran can keep the remaining 12,896 centrifuges. There's no clear details how they will be not allowed to access to excess centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure (The French version is more clear). Also monitoring hasn't stopped North Korea from a bomb.

-

 Irans breakout timeline  the time that it would take for Iran to acquire enough fissile material for one weapon  is currently assessed to be 2 to 3 months. That timeline will be extended to at least one year, for a duration of at least ten years, under this framework.

-

They settled for the one year nuclear breakout. Such short periods of time are very hard to monitor.   

2013 Joint Plan of Action http://eeas.europa.eu/statements/docs/2013/131124_03_en.pdf disallowed construction and enrichment at the Arak reactor

 Iran announces that it will not make any further advances of its activities at the Natanz Fuel
Enrichment Plant[1], Fordow[2], or the Arak reactor[3], designated by the IAEA as IR-40. 

-

[3] Iran announces on concerns related to the construction of the reactor at Arak that for 6 months it will not commission the reactor or transfer fuel or heavy water to the reactor site and will not test additional fuel or produce more fuel for the reactor or install remaining components

-

2015 Joint Plan of Action allows construction and enrichment

 Iran has agreed to redesign and rebuild a heavy water research reactor in Arak, based on a design that is agreed to by the P5+1, which will not produce weapons grade plutonium, and which will support peaceful nuclear research and radioisotope production.




 Kerry said on ABC's "This Week." (November 2013) disallowed Iran entirely from enrichment.

 
"There is no inherent right to enrich," 

-

2015 Joint Plan of Action allows

 Iran has agreed to only enrich uranium using its first generation (IR-1 models) centrifuges at Natanz for ten years, removing its more advanced centrifuges.

What happens after 10 years?

Obama on NPR

"Essentially, we're purchasing for 13, 14, 15 years assurances that the breakout is at least a year," 

-

 "And then in years 13 and 14, it is possible that those breakout times would have been much shorter.

(Basically as if he said let the next Presidents deal with it) 



**French version of Joint Plan of Action** (Very similar to the Iranian version.) 

Allows advanced centrifuges in contrast to the US official parameters, to continue R D work on the advanced IR-4, IR-5, IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges, use of IR-2m and IR-4 centrifuges allowed after 12 years.


 As explained before, this enrichment does not meet Iran's needs except if they are interested in a bomb.

 Does anyone know in whos basement Hillary's campaign website's server is located?  




 I'm sorry you find the title misleading. I'm not sure how I could have written it differently. If I had used the word "involve" instead of "turn" one could still claim it implies that the land is not usable. Also the emphasis is on the whole 41% acting as one antenna while the word "involve" would not properly convey this. I don't know, maybe it's because I'm a [HAM](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio) that I find the language perfectly normal.

 These tests in the late 1960's led to the Sanguine Project, which, in its original form, would have involved 41 percent of Wisconsin. A ''farm'' of antennas totaling 6,000 miles in length were to be buried five feet deep and driven by about 100 buried transmitters. Various elements of the antenna array could be activated to control the direction of transmission.

Iranian Version
___
#Geneva, 24 November 2013

#Joint Plan of Action
___

##Preamble

####The goal for these negotiations is to reach a mutually-agreed long-term comprehensive solution that would ensure Iran's nuclear programme will be exclusively peaceful. Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek or develop any nuclear weapons. This comprehensive solution would build on these initial measures and result in a final step for a period to be agreed upon and the resolution of concerns. This comprehensive solution would enable Iran to fully enjoy its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under the relevant articles of the NPT in conformity with its obligations therein. This comprehensive solution would involve a mutually defined enrichment programme with practical limits and transparency measures to ensure the peaceful nature of the programme. This comprehensive solution would constitute an integrated whole where nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. This comprehensive solution would involve a reciprocal, step-bystep process, and would produce the comprehensive lifting of all UN Security Council sanctions, as well as multilateral and national sanctions related to Iran's nuclear programme
----
####There would be additional steps in between the initial measures and the final step, including, among other things, addressing the UN Security Council resolutions, with a view toward bringing to a satisfactory conclusion the UN Security Council's consideration of this matter. The E3+3 and Iran will be responsible for conclusion and implementation of mutual near-term measures and the comprehensive solution in good faith. A Joint Commission of E3/EU+3 and Iran will be established to monitor the implementation of the near-term measures and address issues that may arise, with the IAEA responsible for verification of nuclear-related measures. The Joint Commission will work with the IAEA to facilitate resolution of past and present issues of concern.
----
####Elements of a first step The first step would be time-bound, with a duration of 6 months, and renewable by mutual consent, during which all parties will work to maintain a constructive atmosphere for negotiations in good faith. Iran would undertake the following voluntary measures:

 From the existing uranium enriched to 20%, retain half as working stock of 20% oxide for fabrication of fuel for the TRR. Dilute the remaining 20% UF6 to no more than 5%. No reconversion line.

 Iran announces that it will not enrich uranium over 5% for the duration of the 6 months.

 Iran announces that it will not make any further advances of its activities at the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant1, Fordow2, or the Arak reactor3, designated by the IAEA as IR-40.

 Beginning when the line for conversion of UF6 enriched up to 5% to UO2 is ready, Iran has decided to convert to oxide UF6 newly enriched up to 5% during the 6 month period, as provided in the operational schedule of the conversion plant declared to the IAEA.

 No new locations for the enrichment.

 Iran will continue its safeguarded R D practices, including its current enrichment R D practices, which are not designed for accumulation of the enriched uranium.

 No reprocessing or construction of a facility capable of reprocessing.

 Enhanced monitoring:

o Provision of specified information to the IAEA, including information on Iran's plans for nuclear facilities, a description of each building on each nuclear site, a description of the scale of operations for each location engaged in specified nuclear activities, information on uranium mines and mills, and information on source material. This information would be provided within three months of the adoption of these measures.

o Submission of an updated DIQ for the reactor at Arak, designated by the IAEA as the IR-40, to the IAEA.

o Steps to agree with the IAEA on conclusion of the Safeguards Approach for the reactor at Arak, designated by the IAEA as the IR-40.

o Daily IAEA inspector access when inspectors are not present for the purpose of Design Information Verification, Interim Inventory Verification, Physical Inventory Verification, and unannounced inspections, for the purpose of access to offline surveillance records, at Fordow and Natanz.

o IAEA inspector managed access to:

  centrifuge assembly workshops4;

  centrifuge rotor production workshops and storage facilities; and,   uranium mines and mills.

 

___

Footnotes:

1 Namely, during the 6 months, Iran will not feed UF6 into the centrifuges installed but not enriching uranium. Not install additional centrifuges. Iran announces that during the first 6 months, it will replace existing centrifuges with centrifuges of the same type.

2 At Fordow, no further enrichment over 5% at 4 cascades now enriching uranium, and not increase enrichment capacity. Not

feed UF6 into the other 12 cascades, which would remain in a non-operative state. No interconnections between cascades.

Iran announces that during the first 6 months, it will replace existing centrifuges with centrifuges of the same type.

3 Iran announces on concerns related to the construction of the reactor at Arak that for 6 months it will not commission the reactor or transfer fuel or heavy water to the reactor site and will not test additional fuel or produce more fuel for the reactor or install remaining components.

4 Consistent with its plans, Iran's centrifuge production during the 6 months will be dedicated to replace damaged machines.

In return, the E3/EU+3 would undertake the following voluntary measures:

 Pause efforts to further reduce Iran's crude oil sales, enabling Iran's current customers to purchase their current average amounts of crude oil. Enable the repatriation of an agreed amount of revenue held abroad. For such oil sales, suspend the EU and U.S. sanctions on associated insurance and transportation services.

 Suspend U.S. and EU sanctions on:

o Iran's petrochemical exports, as well as sanctions on associated services.5 o Gold and precious metals, as well as sanctions on associated services.

 Suspend U.S. sanctions on Iran's auto industry, as well as sanctions on associated services.

 License the supply and installation in Iran of spare parts for safety of flight for Iranian civil aviation and associated services. License safety related inspections and repairs in Iran as well as associated services.6

 No new nuclear-related UN Security Council sanctions.

 No new EU nuclear-related sanctions.

 The U.S. Administration, acting consistent with the respective roles of the President and the

Congress, will refrain from imposing new nuclear-related sanctions.

 Establish a financial channel to facilitate humanitarian trade for Iran's domestic needs using Iranian oil revenues held abroad. Humanitarian trade would be defined as transactions involving food and agricultural products, medicine, medical devices, and medical expenses incurred abroad. This channel would involve specified foreign banks and non-designated Iranian banks to be defined when establishing the channel.

o This channel could also enable:

  transactions required to pay Iran's UN obligations; and,   direct tuition payments to universities and colleges for Iranian students studying abroad, up to an agreed amount for the six month period.

 Increase the EU authorisation thresholds for transactions for non-sanctioned trade to an agreed amount.

___

Footnotes

5 "Sanctions on associated services" means any service, such as insurance, transportation, or financial, subject to the underlying U.S. or EU sanctions applicable, insofar as each service is related to the underlying sanction and required to facilitate the desired transactions. These services could involve any non-designated Iranian entities.

6 Sanctions relief could involve any non-designated Iranian airlines as well as Iran Air.

Elements of the final step of a comprehensive solution*

The final step of a comprehensive solution, which the parties aim to conclude negotiating and commence implementing no more than one year after the adoption of this document, would:

 Have a specified long-term duration to be agreed upon.

 Reflect the rights and obligations of parties to the NPT and IAEA Safeguards Agreements.

 Comprehensively lift UN Security Council, multilateral and national nuclear-related sanctions, including steps on access in areas of trade, technology, finance, and energy, on a schedule to be agreed upon.

 Involve a mutually defined enrichment programme with mutually agreed parameters consistent with practical needs, with agreed limits on scope and level of enrichment activities, capacity, where it is carried out, and stocks of enriched uranium, for a period to be agreed upon.

 Fully resolve concerns related to the reactor at Arak, designated by the IAEA as the IR-40.

 No reprocessing or construction of a facility capable of reprocessing.

 Fully implement the agreed transparency measures and enhanced monitoring. Ratify and implement the Additional Protocol, consistent with the respective roles of the President and the Majlis (Iranian parliament).

 Include international civil nuclear cooperation, including among others, on acquiring modern light water power and research reactors and associated equipment, and the supply of modern nuclear fuel as well as agreed R D practices.

 Following successful implementation of the final step of the comprehensive solution for its full duration, the Iranian nuclear programme will be treated in the same manner as that of any non-nuclear weapon state party to the NPT.

 With respect to the final step and any steps in between, the standard principle that "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed" applies.
