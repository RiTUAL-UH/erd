 I bought a Canon T1i years ago when I was low on funds and was looking for something with better options than a basic point and shoot.  Now I'm looking to get some quality lenses, specifically the Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM http://goo.gl/9IWHkE, but I'm not sure if my entry level DSLR is going to make the most of it.

Has anyone experienced something similar?  If I need to upgrade my camera, how should I go about it? 




 For those of you looking for pictures, this is all I could find.

 It's important to remember that bees are territorial and will attack other hives, killing the bees and stealing their honey if they are too close together.  Not everyone should have a bee hive, and in some regions you can go to a website to determine where the closest hive is to you.  It may not make sense to have one yourself. But for those people that have space for a hive, this looks interesting.  




 It's because if you thought the topic was interesting enough to comment, then it only makes sense that you would want others to see it as well.

 I had the exact opposite thought. A hard cookie would crack rather than be cut in a nice clean line.  




 Thank you! I think that I might have actually unlocked webber by burying him in a grave or something like that.  I'm also at about 80 days in my current ROG game, so it shouldn't be long. 

I guess it's time to start adventure mode.   




 Typically you earn experience after you die that goes towards unlocking additional characters, but I seem to have stopped getting experience. 

I've played over 125 hours, some in ROG, but mostly in the originally game. At this point I have only unlocked the robot. I stopped getting XP a long time ago. 

Can someone tell me how I can started unlocking characters again? 




 In Canada that would be $30,000.  




 My dad loves classic cars, and a '73 240z was the first car he ever bought with his own money. He bought another one in 2001 and let me drive it as much as I wanted. 

It's like your ass is on the ground. I shit you not, you literally feel like you're sitting on the road. I used to take my girlfriend for a ride, and that car was like an aphrodisiac. 

I wasn't alive when it was first  produced, but I'll always love that car.
