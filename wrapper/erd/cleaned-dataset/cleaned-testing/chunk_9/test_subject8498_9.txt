 I said psychotic, not psychic 




 Apparently [he is a real reverend who's wife died](http://www.kwwl.com/story/29413353/2015/06/25/man-says-letter-telling-him-to-kill-himself-was-put-in-his-car), I find it hard he would write that, but who knows, it's entirely possible. I believe it's.l more likely some idiot troll kid or just some idiot troll left it there to mess with him and hurt the guy. 




 Don't feed the troll. 




 A fucking lot. 




 Am paranoid psychotic, can confirm  




 I don't think that's what's showing at all. I take LD very seriously, I practice it every night and I thought the post was funny. I also made a joke about it.  

There's nothing wrong about laughing of ourselves or joke about the subreddit once in a while. 




 It's just a joke, I don't see what's wrong with it. 




 No, he's a scientist

 I think it's coming off great! Try to do the full photo. Most of the times it won't feel 'right' until you colorize it fully.  

Maybe it's a busy photo as you say, but I think it's looking good so far. Try something simpler if you want though, like a portrait with no background. Do the face, eyes, lips, etc. 




 As a photographer, this is amazing. My contract also says very clearly that, if the work were to be cancelled by the client, the retainer is non-refundable. When you put a retainer you are compromising with that person to save that date specifically for you, and if other jobs come along you obviously reject them. If I were to cancel because I had a problem on my side, of course I'm returning 100% of those profits as well as giving you my best recomendations with other photographers. But you cancel me, fuck you.  

I applaud this person, giving the money to GLAD, that's just epic. 




 I work primarily with events photography, such as weddings, parties, etc, and this restoration service is something super new (less than 3 weeks) I'm doing and I started offering it yesterday, after uploading that video. I love taking photos but not so much in weddings and such, more like in personal artistic photos, so if this takes off I'm looking at working of something I love with all my heart, which is editing. Thanks for commenting! 




 Well, the client asked for colorization, so if I'd left it black and white that would've made a bad professional I think :p  

I gave her two digital copies though, one in color an another in black and white. 




 I answered this on another comment, the eyes and hair were my client's indication, and I used a blueish color for the dress to bring up her eyes :) 




 Yes, I had people say me this. Maybe I should've darkened them a little more, and I will keep an eye to that in next videos. Thanks for your input and comment! 




 Thanks a lot! 




 Thanks a lot. Indeed, the photo is from around the 50s. It was such an honor getting to restore this person's picture, I'm sure it brought them joy. She's 70 now.   




 Wow, that's incredible! Thanks so much for sharing your emotions, I'm super glad the video got to you. 




 Thanks a  lot! I'm in Argentina. Yes, I believe I should up the prices a bit, maybe for the next jobs I'll be charging a bit more :) 




 I WANT TO BELIEVE 




 A new novelty account! I love it already.  

PS: do /r/tifu, a lot of /r/tifu. 




 Seems like you were right! That's incredible. Here in Argentina we had a case about a very famous ex-model woman that was photoshoped so badly on a magazine cover that they literally erased her belly button. The woman itself (Susana Gimenez) is a national diva here and when that happened not a single soul didn't know. It was an amazing fuckup. 




 I noticed what you're pointing me, but trust me, no-one else but people who use Photoshop does, that why I didn't say anything. It's barely noticeable and there's like 0 chances someone who doesn't photoshops sees that.  

I didn't know that image from Reuters, that's... I have no words. I don't think that's the photographer's fault though, most of the time this guys or even the magazines have other editors that "improve" (obvious quotation marks here) their photos for them. 




 Sure thing! PM me or ask here if you want help with anything, I'll reply you as soon as I can. 




 Yeah, that's perfect. In the video I used the laso tool for cropping out the right eye, so I get your point. It's really handy for some situations! 




 Thanks so much! I'm definitely going to make more videos and share here. 




 Thanks for sharing your process. I reccomend you read a bit about the Pen tool for selecting, it's far more precise than the laso tool. I think you did a great job, 10/10.  

The reshaping tool I used for the squares from the dress is selecting a part of the image and warping it, I believe it's present in CS2! It's under Edit - Transform - **Warp**. Check it, I believe it's there. I just use a personal shortcut (CTRL+W, which in default mode closes Photoshop I believe) so that's why you you don't see me picking it. 




 You're very welcome! If you have any questions you'd like to ask me, feel free to PM me and I'll get to you as soon as I can. I'll be wanting to see your Photoshop progress! 




 Thanks! Allow me to quote myself on other comment where I responded this:

For this photo I charged the equivalent to $30 USD (maybe a little less, $26 USD). I believe I could've charged a little more, but I'm just starting with this service (repairing old photos) and I want to grab a few customers first. Without the colorization it would've been around $20 USD. 




 Thanks a lot! That's my intention with that new channel. This is definitely my best video so far, I'll try and make the next ones better so you guys enjoy them even more. Thanks for subscribing :D 




 Thanks a lot, I'm super glad you guys enjoyed it so much. 




 Definitely a good sign! I will, thanks for taking the time to comment :) 




 Thanks so much! Glad you enjoyed it! 




 Hi! It took me about two hours, maybe a little less. I really, really like the photo you posted, I think the end result is excellent! How old is that photo?  




 Thanks!  

Definitely the best way is to practice, a lot. There are some great free tutorials and videos out there for you to check. There's also tons of pages that offers great high quality JPGs and RAWs to practice different techniques. When you know your way around the tools, then you can watch speedup videos and learn about different tips and editing techniques, every editor has their own tips and bits that help around the editing process. I've learned so much watching timelapses, it's incredible.  

But anyways, that's my tip. Read tutorials, watch videos (do both, reading tutorials first so you get the grasp more easily and with time), and practice a lot. I'd say the learning curve is fairly fast at the begining. One thing about Photoshop is that you can always learn something new. Use as many layers as you need. Never use the eraser tool, always mask. **Don't be afraid of making mistakes.** We have CTRL ALT Z for that one. And post in forums to recieve critique, be open to the advice and... practice. Practice, practice, practice. :)

 




 I use frequency separation for very special skin retouches only, like some fashion productions or a photobook, and mostly with super close up portraits where the skin has lots of details and I can't afford to miss them. It's an incredible technique, super useful, but I find that the Healing Brush tool can acomplish similar results in faster ways, in photos that don't require much retouching as the ones I mentioned. For those I stick with freq separation, you mantain the level of detail and lose none of the color and luminosity, it's amazing. 




 I will, it sounds promising. Thanks for your suggestion :) 




 It actually is. One of the first I did was the great grandfather of my client, and when her father saw the final photo, she told me he cried and couldn't believe the result. He put the photo next to his mother's by the bed and told her he finally got to see him every day. That was incredibly moving and I felt amazing. 




  Thanks a lot! Practice, read tutorials and watch videos. You'll get way more badass than this in no time! 




 THIS particular photo was sent to me via email and unfortunately had a low resolution. That was a downer. But, in terms of me scanning, depending on the size of the photo I use 800-1400dpi. My scan goes up to 4800 I think but that's just unnecessarily big, unless the photo is too small. 




 Thanks so much! As I said in other comment, just practice, read tutorials, watch videos, and you are going to be able to do much more complex things than this :)  

I haven't tried that, no, but I will! One of the things that I absolutely love about Photoshop is that there are SO many ways to reach your goals, don't you agree? 




 I did both, but honestly the videos and tutorials out there help an awful lot. What I did in this video isn't even that hard technically, it's juts lots of cloning, meticulous selection and layers, layers, and layers. And patience, lots of that!   

Get started today on some basic tutorials, and you'll improve greatly in a few weeks! I promise. 




 I've been using Photoshop for about 12 or 14 years now, I can't recall exactly but pretty much since I owned my first computer. I got more seriously into it a few years back though, in my career (I did 3 years of Photography, in which I had a lot of digital edition learning).  

Edit: grammar, my English sucks 




 Thanks so much!  




 Thanks a lot! I will :) 




 Hi! No, just a Logitech G100s mouse.  




 It is! My idea is to incentivate people to send me bulks of photos, which they tend to have more than just 1 or 2 pictures siting around. I have discount prices for more than 10 pictures to accomplish this goal as well. I can clear 10 pics in a few hours from my computer and earn $150 USD without doing much, and people (especially old people) get **extremely** happy when they see the result, it's great.  




 I don't mind at all. For this photo I charged the equivalent to $30 USD (maybe a little less, $26 USD). I believe I could've charged a little more, but I'm just starting with this service (repairing old photos) and I want to grab a few customers first. Without the colorization it would've been around $20 USD. 




 Don't forget macro! You can reverse it and at 18mm it shoots incredible detailed closeups. 




 Thanks! The colors of the eyes and hair, I asked the client (who was the girl's daughter), and for the dress I selected a nice blueish color that would wring up her eyes :)  




 Is it me or you can actually see the Moon moving because of the large zoom? That's insane 




 Try it! Use layers, remember that, even for cloning, because if you make a mistake and miss it, you can fix it later in no-time instead of going back and dismissing a lot of changes you've made. 

If you got the time and patience you'll find it's much easier than you think :) 




 Ha, far from that! But thanks, it's great that you enjoyed it. 




 Thanks! About 2 hours, there's some minor retouch that I didn't record, some details that I missed and then included in the final photo comparison. 




 Thanks! I used Open Broadcaster Software for recording (it's totally free, which is great), and then I added the titles, music, and speedup in Adobe Premiere. I'm glad you enjoyed it. 




 Thanks so much! Super glad you liked it 




 Thanks! It's some hard work indeed. It doesn't require much Photoshop knowledge though, it's mostly patience! 




 Thanks so much! I'm glad you liked it. 









 Can someone confirm how they ended up?  




 That was really fucked up, I want to gift you a baby goat now :(

 Estoy de acuerdo. Es una cagada? Por supuesto, pero valoro ms mi vida que **cualquier** cosa material que puedan sacarme. Igualmente, no garantiza nada.  

Hace unas semanas en Moreno (Paso del Rey para ser exactos) a un paciente de mi vieja (psicloga) lo agarraron unos pendejos de 17/20 a la 1am. Iba caminado con la mochila atrs y de repente lo tiran al piso, agarrndolo de la mochila. El tipo les dijo "tranquilos chicos, llevense todo". Lo cagaron a trompadas, lo tajearon, y no le cortaron el cuello por casualidad (lleg a ponerse la mano y le regalaron 15 puntos en una palma). Brutal. Le sacaron celular y billetera y se fueron. No se resisti, no se puso nervioso, se fue con un tabique roto, la cara moretoneada y vivo de pedo.  

Evidentemente no resistirse no garantiza nada, pero s, reduce muchos las chances de que cobres.

 Since I saw that video where the airplane crashes in an air show and sends pieces of people flying everywhere I keep my airshows quota pretty boring as well. Specially since the guy filming zooms in an arm just sitting there on the grass. Brutal. 




 Man... That sucks. I have a bit of experience with psychedelics and let me tell you, they can fuck-you-up. The last time I consumed a powerful psych was Salvia about 5 or 6 months ago, which is one of my favorites. It wasn't a bad trip or anything like that, but the intensity and duration of it made me want to stop for a little while. I got an existential crisis with it that brought me a great deal of anxiety over the next months and that I'm still battling to get over. I started doubting reality a lot. Like, really doubting. I got severe HPPD that now has luckily toned down a lot and there were moments were I was almost sure I was hallucinating the whole reality. Really fucking irresponsible from my part to have reached this point, but well. Had to cut clean the weed also because it wasn't healping with my anxiety either.    

I'm glad I stopped because my biggest fear was to end up like your friend. I know a people or two who have done psychedelics an awful, awful lot and they giggle over the silliest things, have lapsus like you describe and just aren't the same. It's cool to experience what psychedelics have to offer but it should be done under extreme responsibility and control of yourself. I hope your friend gets better :)  




 Not mine, a friend's. Pretty normal for the deepweb actually, he bought DMT from India and it arrived here to Argentina a few months later, inside of an air pocket on a fake bank letter. The very wtf part was that the dude sent a tab of LSD free of charge as well, which is very fucking weird. Well, I never bought drugs on the dw so maybe that's some kind of a normal deal, but it doesn't sound normal to me. Everything was legit, the tabs were good LSD and the DMT was good purity also.
