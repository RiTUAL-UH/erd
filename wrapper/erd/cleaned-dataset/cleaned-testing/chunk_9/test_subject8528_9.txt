 I'm trying to complete the quest, "An Indispensable Ally" but all of the dialog boxes and the choice box is blank and as such I can't get past it. How can I try and fix this?

EDIT: Deleted and completely redownloaded the game and it worked. It took a few hours, but now I can progress through the story. 




 I think the issue with "Blank" is that people try to use it in a rotation rather than as a situational skill.

There is a time and place for it such as in Copperbell where you have to keep the squiggans away from the bomb so that you can break apart the slime. Another place would be in ST during the Amon fight to keep the slimes away while being killed. 




 Archer knocks themselves back rather than the enemy. 




 He is playing as a "dark" knight. 




 For MMOs, Guild Wars 2 might interest you as it is a buy to play MMO rather than a monthly subscription. 




 This is one where you either love it or hate it and you can tell depending on your reaction to it. There is also a trial/demo version available if you are on the fence.

 




 It doesn't but there is a lot of content to be experienced at level 50 and it seems as though you skipped it to go level another class. 




 Yes you can, just swap your main arm or create a gear outfit to make swapping instantaneous outside of combat and in a sanctuary.

Well, if you get burnt out trying to level a low class, you aren't forced to do it. 

Since you were talking about leveling WAR/PLD dungeons would be the best place to go as you get a lot of exp from the mobs. I was able to get my WAR from 15-21 by doing three dungeons.  




 Levequests aren't good for combat classes, you might want to try some of the fates or even the level 50 content as there is a LOT of story after reaching 50 to get through that was added for free. 




 Yeah, I had to entirely ignore the bass and listen to the new voice a number of times to come up with a guess as to what they were singing. 




 Sure, but I didn't feel like constantly calling upon those in my FC to run dungeons that they are well past and don't need to complete as they tend to take 25-45 minutes to do. I used the time by doing fates and stuff to level up. 




  [Can't make out this part]

It sounds like, "So we bode with rage". (Bode is not bodes as the upcoming w might have caused those who are singing to pollute the vowel creating an "s" sound.) 




 It could also be from the introductory scene. 




 Sadly dungeons are only awesome for tanks and healers as they have much faster queues. (2-5 minutes vs 20-35 minutes as DPS) 




 Thats the thing, I took my time and watched the cutscenes and I also completely leveled a crafting job/class. I also thought the start of Astral was the last story part until last week. 

FFXIV was my first real MMO so I had to learn the ropes and such. 




 Here is a better description, taken from the manga's page on MAL:

Struggling manga author Satoru Fujinuma is beset by his fear to express himself. However, he has a supernatural ability of being forced to prevent deaths and catastrophes by being sent back in time before the incident occurred, repeating time until the accident is prevented. One day, he gets involved in an accident that has him framed as a murderer. Desperate to save the victim, he sends himself back in time only to find himself as a grade-schooler one month before fellow classmate Kayo Hinadzuki went missing. Satoru now embarks on a new quest: to save Kayo and solve the mystery behind her disappearance. 




 Pretty long as there are 346 main story quests that have their own cutscenes, not to mention all of the sidequests.

I've been playing for ~90 total days, of being subbed, and I am just about to catch up with where Heavensward starts. 




 Thank you! All of them, except for the Abhorsen series, seemed interesting and I am looking forward to reading them. 




 I used to read a lot as a kid, but now that I am in college I've found it hard to find the time to read. With it being summer, I finally have the time to sit down a read.

Outside of the required classes for my literature class two years ago, I've read:

* Hunger Games Trilogy

* Ready Player One (Armada looks interesting)

* Homeland by Cory Doctrow (I didn't like the ending)

* Ender's Game

* Speaker for the Dead

I tried to get into Xenocide, but the shift from Portugese to Chinese is jarring.

I've looked into, finally, reading The Hobbit and then the Lord of the Rings series. Similarly with the Wheel of Time series due to its purported depth and the sheer magnitude of the work. (4.4 million+ words) 

So, I guess I am looking for something interesting to read. I've grown up surrounded by books as my mother is an elementary school media specialist. (ie. Librarian) 




 Well, there is now an official remake. It is using, what appears to be, the same engine as FFXV. 




 What about the announcement of Fallout 4 or the FFVII remake? 




 It doesn't support .ass files. (Yes, that is an [actual filetype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubStation_Alpha#Advanced_SubStation_Alpha) and it is used for subtitles with typesetting and it supports additional features like animation.) 




 I think the cutesy Final Fantasy will do well. The POP! figures are really popular int he US right now and Japan has the nendoroid figures that are selling well, so to have a Final Fantasy in that style would be an interesting but safe choice. 




 Putting on different files will not help. You'd have to format the drive and make sure the file system is exFat or FAT. 




 A certain character's backstory in Sket Dance. For a gag manga it was pretty hard hitting. 




 The city of the "old ones" looked like that of the city from Killzone: Shadow Fall, I think it is set in the same universe/planet. 




 It, probably, is that you are using NFTS rather than a version of Fat. (exFat or Fat32) 




 [Kickstarter link](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ysnet/shenmue-3) 




 They said it would never happen, yet here we are. 




 In the [youtube description of the European trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3piye62BYf4), which is in English, it says that it is coming to PS4, Xbox One and PC.

I am really looking forward to it.
 




 While it isn't on the front page, [Re;Birth2 is also on sale for 70% off](http://store.steampowered.com/app/351710/) and it just came out about two weeks ago.

EDIT: The above comment had asked about Hyperdimension Neptunia, hence my reply. Odds are they edited it within the thre minute timeframe where Reddit does not show edits. 




 Poor /u/banjothebear. 




 Simple, they are pandering to the fans. 




 What I need is a boxen of doughnuts. 




 I'm not surprised that "If My Heart Had Wings" is missing from the Japanese marketplace. The title was originally released in Japan as "Kono Oozora ni, Tsubasa wo Hirogete" back in 2012, according to [VNDB](https://vndb.org/v9093). 




 Wrong, the base price was always $12.99. They had it on sale for $10 before the sale as a introductory promotion. They kept it the same price for the Summer Sale as well. 




 I never mentioned Super Meat Boy at all... All I did was suggest that Duck Game needed a controller. 




 It just came out last week, I doubt it will go on a further sale. I got it on the 11^th and I've already put in ~7 hours while playing online. 

You **will** need a controller as the KB controls are a bit weird. (You can rebind them, but I couldn't figure out a good layout.) 




 Quack pitch doesn't work with a PS4 controller as the trigger also acts as a button.  




 Just to let you know, 2048 BTC doesn't payout what they say they do. 




 [Here is a demonstration of Kirby doing the Shakunetsu Hadouken](https://youtu.be/Dj5m7POKl_8?t=2)

While everyone is poring over how Roy and Ryu stand up to the competition, I was curious as to how Kirby reacted to Ryu's advanced techniques or he even had them.

Well, Kirby not only gets the Street Fighter inputs but can also pull off the Shakunestu Hadouken. This is the first time that Kirby had gotten more than one move from a character it sucked in! Like with Ryu, you have to do a bottom half circle from L-R to attack to the right and R-L to attack to the left. 

Kirby is also subject to the Hadouken cooldown, but it is quite short compared to Ryu.

I have *not* tested the difference in damage between the Kirby "B" Hadouken and the "D, DR, R + A" Hadouken.

**EDIT**: Made the YouTube link go right before the actual move. (I whiffed it the first time I tried) 




 Huh, I found that Kirby does the light jab and not the usual 3 direction punch if you just hold "a". As soon as it makes contact or if you move it goes to the regular 3 direction punch. 




 I've noticed that if you hold "A" without any other inputs, Kirby does Ryu's light punch/jab. Kirby can also do the regular Hadouken with the SF input. I haven't checked enough about light kicks but I would think that Kirby gets them as well. 




 While everyone is talking about Roy and Ryu, I decided to see how Kirby deals with Ryu's moves. Kirby not only gets the "B" hadouken but also some of the A attacks and he can use the Street Fighter inputs to get the Shakunetsu Hadouken.

Please excuse the poor quality, I had to balance my phone and put in the inputs which requires the use of both hands. 




 Gaijin is the company behind War Thunder. They jacked up the prices of their packs that people can buy on steam to make it seem like there is a higher discount than there really is. 




 Well, the script was written by Jun Madea. He is the same person who wrote and did the music for Air, Kanon, Clannad, Planetarian, Little Busters, Angel Beats, along with a piece for Rewrite. 




 MXWRK seems to have merged with Traffic Micro... 




 Well, it isn't straight but Amtrak has at least one cross country route. I was able to find a way to go from Maryland to California but it would take a total of 76 hours of travel time to get there one way. 









 I wish I could go, but they don't have a one day pass. I live within driving distance of Baltimore. 




 The Truck strikes again.
 




 The roller already does this. Just tap the fire button and it will throw paint in front of you. 




 For those of you wondering, this is from the movie *Good Will Hunting*. 

Source: Watched the movie earlier today. 




 To give people an English example of this, it would be similar to the Shia Lebouf video that everyone is using to create some funny scenes. 




 I don't think they'd ban if you autoclick. It is just a promotional tool for a sale, nothing really tangible is attached to the game other than some discounts. 




 I said that the game freezes, as in the HP doesn't update if you rapidfire. It doesn't freeze the browser. 




 You could also get rid of sleep altogether but I've noticed that even at 100 that it freezes the game, even in firefox. 




 Yep, if you are too lazy to google use this script:
    
    toggle = 0
    #MaxThreadsPerHotkey 2
    
    F8::
        Toggle := !Toggle
         While Toggle{
            Click
            sleep 100
        }
    return

100 might be too fast for the game (10 times a second) so try 150 or 200 in place of it if need be. 




 It was [interesting to see his reaction](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2014-05-11/kiss-singer-gene-simmons-reacts-to-love-live-kiss-parody) to his banding being parodied/referenced as well. 




 Sorry about that, I just remember seeing that people were asking about the 18+ content in the discussion board and I assumed they removed the 18+ content in the Steam release. 




 While I haven't played most of these, here are some notable ones to watch out for: (The only order is the top seller ranking on the Visual Novel tag as of June 10, 2015.)

 It is against the ToS of mTurk for a requester to require software installation to do a survey. If they are, return it immediately.

You might want to look on the [mturk forum](http://mturkforum.com/) (Not affiliated with Amazon, but a good community nonetheless) for good hits to do.

 




 From what I have heard about it, the story is really good. 




 Probably the most memorable would be the [KS Lily Spoilers](#s "Wheat field scene where it is just them and no one around and the emotions that said scene portrayed."). 




 I realize this is an old thread, but you could always deposit it into your bank account and then use paypal to buy it. (I came across this through a google search.) 














 I don't think anyone knows at this point. So far the refunds have only been available for weekdays so this is a learning/growing period. 




 Try clicking on your name and inventory again. I've found that doing this will fix the issue. 




 I've seen people saying 2-3 days from the time of approval for the funds to be returned. 




 Rather than reinstalling your OS, look into creating a bootable USB/DVD of a rescue disk such as the [Kaspersky Rescue Disc](http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/rescuedisk). It will boot your PC from the USB/DVD and scan without any Windows programs running. Unless your virus/malware is really advanced, it should be dormant when running from the USB/DVD device. 




  This is truly a sequel to Fate/Zero

Thing is, she isn't walking [widdershins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widdershins) but going clockwise around him. (Which is the opposite direction) 




 JoJo's Bizarre Adventure  




 Early access for Heavensward, which is the new expansion for Final Fantasy XIV, starts on June 19th. Most of the thread is of people, like myself, lamenting how Splatoon is addictive and it is taking away time from various games, namely FFXIV which has a monthly subscription fee. 




 Thing is, there are about 100 or so quests to do AFTER the main story. The amount of endgame content is crazy. 




 Thankfully WAR and other tank classes are easy to do once you can run dungeons as you, pretty much, have instant DF and it always gives a good chunk of experience. (If it is your first class, make sure you do the story as well!) 




 I got my refund approved around 8PM EST today. It took about three days. I have to wait for my funds now.  




 Yeah, I've seen a number of posts from people who are still waiting on an approval for a refund that was requested the first day it was available. I, myself, included. At this point, it is out of our hands and it is a matter of Valve getting around to approving/declining them.

EDIT - Some examples:

* [#1](http://redd.it/38obh1)

* [#2](http://redd.it/38kfow)

* [#3](http://redd.it/38h590)

* [#4](http://redd.it/38gfc1) 




 Considering it just started a few days ago, people do not have a time frame as to when the refunds would be processed. At this point, just wait. 




 Within Tokyo there is Ikebukuro with Otome Doori (Mainly BL stuff) and Nakano with Nakano Broadway. (An odd mix as the entrance way is all normal shops but as you enter the actual Nakano Broadway it turns into a mini Akihabara. Even then, the main floor is normal stuff and slightly otaku things, the upper is pretty much all otaku stuff and the lower level has a grocery store.) 

That is out of what I know, and can remember, odds are there are more within Tokyo itself that I didn't list. 




 It used to be like this in the US as well. On the back of my copy of The Fellowship of the Ring it has a box saying for people to search "lord of the Rings" on AOL. 




 The only real referral possibility that OP had was the Amazon Prime sign up and they used the normal link. OP gets nothing out of this. 




 Mainly the soundtracks for Clannad, Little Busters, Angel Beats and Girls und Panzer OST due to the fact that I own them and they are really good soundtracks. 




 My guess they only have the ability to do X number of refunds an hour. Odds are so many people requested a refund on the first day that they are playing catch up. I've been waiting for a few days for a refund as well. 




 Look, it is fine to not want to see certain games but to dismiss them as "shameful" is a bit much. Those games, just like any other, are a culmination of people's work and there are consumers interested in such things. I'm not here to change your opinion on such matters.


---
As for the curators, I would say to go through the types of games that they recommend and select "Not interested" as "Steam recommends curators to follow based on the games those curators recommend and how well we think those fit with the games you've been playing recently." 




 If you don't like the games they curate, you don't have to subscribe/follow them. It isn't like your eyes are going to melt out of their sockets if you run into one of those pages while perusing a game. 

Heck, those curators tend to stay towards the Japanese related games and such so there isn't an issue. 




 Even better is that it is coming out for the PS3 and Vita in the US later this year! [Here](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2015/01/29/dengeki-bunko-fighting-climax-coming-to-ps3-vita-this-year/) is a post about it on the Playstation Blog. 




 You have to submit a ticket to Steam telling them that your account was hijacked with proof of ownership. The good thing is that it seems as though your hacker didn't delete all of your email like they did for mine. (I was, thankfully able to restore my deleted emails) 




 What is this about? Why should we trust such a contest?

Based on the username you are obviously self-promoting, but who are you and why should we care? Are you even going to pay the winner? 




 You could try. In the news release, they said that even if you are outside of the 14 days that they might consider a refund on your purchase. 




 Yep, I tried Lego Worlds and got bored within twenty minutes as I realized there wasn't that much to do other than build and it is hard to build large things without a flat surface to really spread out on so I requested a refund. Hopefully we hear back soon. (I really want to pre-order Heavensward now but I'm ~$4 short...) 




 Based on what OP said, they haven't even gotten an approval from Valve. 

Sadly they didn't give a time frame on the approval process as I am waiting as well. (I requested mine around 8:50PM EST yesterday) 




 [Here.](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=private+internet+access) 




 I use PrivateInternetAccess as it is pretty cheap on the yearly renewal. ($3.33 a month rather than $5-6+)

It works well and I haven't had any issues while using it. 




 I've played on VAC enabled servers while on a VPN without any issues. You should be fine. A VPN only encrypts your traffic between you and the server. For all Valve knows you are playing where the server is not where you are. 




 If you have it, provide as much proof of ownership as possible. Back in the beginning of May, I was able to get my hijacked account back within 24 hours since I provided three different proof of purchases. 




  n XIV, an enemy aggro'ing me in the open world is just a mild annoyance.

Except for those dang toads near Mor Dhona.  




 The guy is calling after his dog who is herding a lot of deer and he can't catch up. I guess it is more so the voice and tone of the guy which makes it humorous. 




 If you look in the post from the IC dev team there is a process in which you can get a refund on the DLC packs that they had on Steam. 




 Rather than creating the data yourself, look into parsing through [aniDB](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=main) as they already have a bunch of tags that get more and more specific.

Heck, they even have a [full blown page about their API](http://wiki.anidb.net/w/API) and how to use it and such. 




 I figured as such. Invariably someone will take pictures and share them on here anyways so we might be able to see it. 




 Well, it isn't until October 31, so you have plenty of time to prepare. They even have a [page](http://kyoanido-event.com/en/) where people from other countries can register to attend the event. 




 Based upon the [English version of the site](http://kyoanido-event.com/en/), it seems to be a two day event in Miyakomesse, Japan from October 31-November 1st.

It doesn't seem to list anything about what would go on during the event. Considering the amount of time between now and then, odds are, they will release more information as it approaches. 




 The four characters are separate images from one another, so someone would have to piece it together in photoshop or something. 




 These are the books I had to get/use for my Japanese Media and Pop Culture class:

* Japanamerica: How Japanese Pop Culture Has Invaded the U.S. - ISBN-13: 978-1403984760

* A Geek in Japan: Discovering the Land of Manga, Anime, Zen, and the Tea Ceremony - ISBN-13: 978-4805311295

Here is another that might be good:

* The Otaku Encyclopedia: An Insider's Guide to the Subculture of Cool Japan - ISBN-13: 978-1568365497

 




 Every account on reddit is a bot except you. 




 Another way of taking care of the RMT spam is to use Guildworks, which hooks into the game when it launches, to remove messages that pertain the to patterns that the spammers use.

While GW is, technically, against the ToS, I've been using it for months without any issues. 




 Unless you really need to anonymize your VPN purchase, I would say to just buy it through Paypal or Amazon Payments. (I think they also take bitcoin so that would be an option)

I'm not too sure what the best deal is on exchanging gift cards. I only used the feature since I had a gift card that I would never use and figured it would be of some use. 

P.s. The exchange is instantaneous and they send the account details to the email you provide them. 




 You can even use gift cards to pay for it as well. 




 Thanks for replying, sorry about the interjection in my initial comment. I'll go back and remove it.

I do have a copy of planetarian, but I haven't changed the font since it is perfectly legible as is.

I am really looking forward to the release of Clannad when it becomes available on Steam and it will be a day one purchase from me as I love the story and music from the series. 




 At least in the us. Over in Japan a new volume of manga is 400-500 ($4-5 USD) rather than the $10 per here. (The difference in price is due to the manga in the US being printed on higher quality paper, licensing/translations costs and what not) 




 I'm not sure it gets standard updates since the credit page from the translation group says to go to his pixiv page. (pixiv is sort of like deviantart) 




 I briefly recall that the Steam release is on an updated engine compared to the 18+ version and that it would be impossible to bring the 18+ stuff into the newer engine.  




 Even better is that later this year, Clannad will be released on Steam. The most recent update was that the translation was at 75% with editing not too far behind it.

**EDIT:** Removed interjection on release date. 

I am not affiliated with Sekai Project and as such, any comment here within was simply guessing from someone eager about the game. 




 What ever you do, don't use Hola. They were found to be selling your bandwidth.

 You used the wrong flair:

You had: **Suggestion**

You needed: **Request**

You are *request*ing anime to watch, not giving a *suggest*ion.

I have changed it accordingly, but please remember to choose the right flair in the future. 




 No, you are reading it wrong. 

The only PC release that Frontwing has in Japan, of first Grisaia game, is 18+.

Sekai Project, the publishers and localizers of the Steam release, ported the entire game from the Vita to the PC to bring in the all-ages content.

EDIT: This is also what the original comment you replied to said.

 Frontwing never made an all ages PC version of the game. The Vita edition, since it couldn't have the 18+ content, had additional CGs and scenes in place of it.

Outside of the all ages version, a few other things were cut or toned down such as the lewd jokes and parts of Amane's route due to the contents there of.

EDIT: Vita, not "wita". 




 It is the version number. Odds are they did this in the case that either the physics in the game are changed or the map is updated in some form or another. 

This is so that people have a frame of reference as to what version of the game this was done on. 




 While it isn't "beermoney", you may want to look at getting a loan from the bank for the amount you need. You'd have to repay it of course, but it would get you on your feet until you started your job in a few months. 

I mean, you can supplement it through stuff like mTurk but you won't be able to do it all through beermoney. 




 Well, thanks for doing them! I was wondering if you had stopped or something as I suggested it back in the [episode 14 thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/328y3o/spoilers_fatestay_night_unlimited_blade_works/cq9ekyj?context=3)
