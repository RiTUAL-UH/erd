 Did you try to find out where the door lead too? 




 Even if this is fake, this still gave me the chills unlike a lot of content I see here on /r/creepy, so I give this props. I'm pretty disappointed in this sub for being filled with pictures that are more, for a lack of a better word, weird instead of creepy. This had a story that really does disturb you, and, despite being fake, gave me a little bit of the creeps. This is what I look for on this sub, but it's incredibly rare that I do indeed find this type of disturbing material. I think we should have a rule here that explains behind every creepy picture that there needs to be a story. No more artwork unless there is a creepy back story to it, no more "My cat is giving me a creepy stare" type pics, etc. I find that the "meat" in these posts just aren't there. In my point of view, when I see artwork uploaded to this site, or a pic in general, it's more of an "oh, that's cool" kind of vibe rather than a "damn, now that is scary." But this is just my opinion, and I just needed to get this off my chest without getting a bunch of "dude, chill man." comments. I think with an improvement to the rules here we can filter out the "oh, that's cool" type posts and get more "damn, now that is scary" posts. Once again, this is just my personal opinion and something I needed to get off my chest. Thank you for taking the time to read, cheers! :] 




 Thank you for this. I've always had a fear of sleep paralysis and after reading this I feel a bit better as to at least have an idea of handling it. (Hopefully I won't have to experience it in the first place.)   




 Thank you very much. 




 What do you think would push him over the edge like that? This is becoming a lot more of a curios case when more questions are asked. Hell, I think there is a whole lot more to this when you look at who exactly wants this information and why they do want it in the first place. This is really tugging at my strings here, and I think everybody, including myself, would love to be updated on as to what you find out. Keep up the good work, Meredith. I'll be looking forward to what secrets you uncover next. 




 Thank you. 




 Thank you. 




 May I have your autograph by chance?
