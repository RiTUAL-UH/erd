 K-On Genesis Evangelion.  




 That's Super *Tengen Toppa* Gurren Lagann, who is 3 Billion (?) light-years tall. 

Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann is the form that came from Arc-Gurren Lagann piloting the Cathedral Terra, the space battleship that was hidden inside the Moon. 




 The Rebuild of Evangelion movies are sequels to the original Neon Genesis Evangelion.  




 \implying Mr. Satan isn't the greatest martial artist alive or dead.  









 Yaoi hands? 




 Not just any boxer, that's Rocky Balboa.


WHY IS YHERE A MINION OF ROCKY FUCKING BALBOA

AND HOW IS IT IN ANY WAY RELEVANT

Time to go commit sudoku.  




 "Frankly, my dear, I respect your opinion as completely legitimate." 




 I can't find it on eBay, Amazon, or Rightstuf. The links on the Aniplex website are down. Is there anywhere it's still available?  




 The "fucking Power Armor gimmick" edition is sold out forever.  




 This post is the only Fallout-related result when I googled "Fallout Sailor Moon"

Which means no one has modded Usagi's hair into FO3 yet. I'm very disappointed by this.  









 Armor with a bare midriff would be impractical, but since she's in nothing but a tee shirt and the bottom half of a jumpsuit, it's fair to assume it would be for mobility/cooling purposes. 

Or maybe the Senshi just like showing off.  




 A man and a man? What's next, a man and Mothra?!?! The Bible says we shouldn't allow [Them!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047573/) to marry!!!!!

I watch too many giant insect movies.  




 She can't touch type? What is this, the 1800s? 




 Is nothing sacred?  




 Evil me is a Communist Atheist Nazi. While he would probably be better in combat (because I'm an out-of-shape weeb piece of shit), his undoing would be his monologues. I know for a *fact* that while I would have the better one-liners of the two of us, he would start monologuing the moment he got the upper hand. 




 Isn't a doppelganger just someone who looks like you? 




 There are dozens of us! 

Dozens! 




 But the T-800 would have to switch off of read-only mode in Middle-Earth. He only did so in T2 because John wanted him to stop being such a dork. Even then, he didn't really have his own emotions, he just comprehended John's.  




 To be fair, I thought it was Unit-13 for a second 




 Pigs are communists though, so it's all cool.  




 Stage 15 Jontron withdrawal.  




 Fishing for Gaghiel? 




 It *does* help that TTGL is a bit of a parody of NGE.  




 Noriko is like Shinji without a dick but with bigger balls.  




 Two words: Gurren Lagann.  




 It was. It was also Hideaki Anno's directorial debut.  




 Fuck. That actually makes a lot of sense.  




 It also helps that Ramiel's the only angel to be implied to be even close to female (Lilith notwithstanding) 




 Glad I'm not the only one who knows where their towel is.  




 So... Bayonetta confirmed? 




 I'm so happy I managed to snag one while they were still on Amazon.  




 The rebel alliance get some new recruits: Noriko Takaya and Amano Kazumi, along with their Buster Machines. Using the Gunbuster, can the rebels destroy the Death Star without needing Luke? Do they even have to use the one weak spot? 









 I'll trade you a NiB Mario for a Rosalina restock.  




 There's Sadamoto's manga, which tells the same story, but with several minor (and some major) differences (For one, Kaworu shows up way earlier and is actually a full-fludged character). There's a couple other mangas as well, like Campus Apocalypse, but none of them are really very good like the original. 

Once you've gotten to every Evangelion medium, you could try some other, similar shows. Gunbuster was the first work of Evangelion's director, Hideaki Anno. It's also a great work which greatly influenced mecha, especially Evangelion. They also share similar themes and characters, to the point where Shinji seems like Gunbuster's Noriko with a dick. There's also Gurren Lagann, which is an incredibly badass sort-of-parody of Evangelion. Finally, Madoka Magica. In the most basic sense, it's Evangelion with magical girls instead of mechs.  




 This is specifically in reference to the mobile game.  




 Games are just 1s and 0s but most of us still like 'em.  




 Was Hikari even *in* 2.22? 




 That's stupid. Just who in the hell do they think they are? 




 I called my local GS, and they said it's not happening, so chill yo.  




 Why not? 




 On DVD, preferably.  




 Kinky.  




 That would be great. I'm fucking tired of hearing Peter Parker's origin story, give me a new Spider-Man origin.  




 I think she actually looks really good. I might pick her up, even though I wasn't planning on getting any of wave 5A.  




 Where'd you get your hands on that? It looks awesome 




 That makes sense, since they were all animated by a different studio and not considered canon. 




 One of the best in the whole series. Better than Hedorah.  




 Marv Newland produced by Mr and Mrs Newland 




 In, like, a display case?  




 Why? 




 To be fair, the "Mario is a communist" one ended with him pointing out how batshit theories can get.  




 Bullshit. We all know Lucina's flatter than Mr Game and Watch.  




 Tabris got the booty.  




 Gonna make a Captain Falcon with realistic booty.  




 I didn't know you could become a cop in this game 




 Not the pilots, the robots. 

Unit-00, Unit-01, and Unit-02. Best anime MILFs.  




 January is usually a terrible month for movies. Like one or two good ones, max. 

I had not taken the competition from Star Wars into consideration.  




 can't lose those gains, brah 




 It's a shame, since that's the one thing that really brings down the movie. If it weren't for that, I'd say it's one of the best in the series.  




 Yeah, despite being the focus of most of the advertising, he was killed off in like the first half hour of the movie.  




 I think /u/GamingTatertot might have been referencing the new Godzilla. I hope, because if not he just accidentally described that movie pretty accurately.  




 Next January

That's not a good sign.  




 You gotta monologue before getting into the suit. That's badass 101. Arms folded, too. [Like a fuckin' pimp.](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/664/747/f5f.jpg) 




 Because once she gets developed as a character, she's one of the more complex and sympathetic characters to have ever been written in an anime. 

I was referring to the actual quality of the dub though. Because Tiffany Grant's Asuka is fucking perfect. Everyone else's performance smooths out by that point too.  




 Rob Bethesda at gunpoint.  




 What if Godzilla was one of us? 




 Every time I rewatch it, I find Evangelion's first couple episodes to be pretty tough to get through. Though that could be because the dub doesn't get good until Asuka shows up... 




 *unzips dick* 




 What about G14? 

Also, I think Gojira's a pretty bad place to start. The dark tone and general gloomy nature clash with the rest of the series, to the point where it's practically separate from the other movies (G85 notwithstanding) 




 And the Inklings 




 As an American, that's pretty much my understanding of Boston.  




 Ganondorf is high-tier in terms of porn site sponsorships.  




 I found out the preorders had started when I learned that they ran out of Pip-Boys. 




 Teen Sword Squad! 




 I wasn't gonna get this DLC, but now I think I might.  




 Reggie looking like he's playing Little Mac 




 when u nut but Todd Howard still suckin 




 Gonna keep these box boxes nib 




 Is Ryu going to S-tier? Because it looks like Ryu is going to S-tier.  




 \not keeping your box boxes in a box 




 "Jet fuel can't melt steel beams"

It's a phrase making fun of 9/11 conspiracy theorists.  




 I can do it.  




 I'm not entirely sure I can get with that. Oh well, worst case scenario is someone mods it out.  




 Someone's never played Melee.  




 Its only seriously redeeming feature is the Chao garden

City Escape.  




 But it wouldn't make sense *not* to use Bayonetta. Since she is being exclusive now.  




 "MATOI RYUKO!" 




 Shame they're limiting themselves just to Bayonetta then.  




 The good news is that Ryu's amiibo will be one o might be able to get, since it looks like the third-parties are relatively common (at least at my local TRUS) 




 Did they say they were only doing *one* smash ballot character? 




 Do you play Boswer Jr as "Lagann"?

That's what I'm planning on naming my Bowser Jr amiibo, anyway.  




 My favorite fun Super Robot show is Gunbuster (and to a lesser extent, its sequel, Diebuster). Another Gainax mecha which TTGL takes heavy inspiration from (some people even claim that the end result of TTGL was an attempt to one-up the size of the Diebuster). IT's a classic that every mecha/anime fan should watch at least once. Considering TTGL is less of a show and more of a "best-of" video of mecha influence, a lot of it is taken straight from the playbook of Gunbuster. 

There's also Getter Robo and Mazinger, which I can't personally attest to, but are some of the other classic Super Robots that really shaped the genre (apparently someone cuts a planet in half in Shin Getter Robo)

If you start feeling depressed, hit up Evangelion. Alongside TTGL and Gun/Diebuster, it stands at the top of the Super Robot genre. It's the deconstruction of the genre, being much more character-focused and less action-focused (don't let that turn you off, I actually consider it the greatest anime of all time). While not enjoyable for the same reasons as TTGL, you should certainly watch it. Gurren Lagann was actually somewhat of a parody of Evangelion (when you watch the show you'll see what I mean. There's a lot of connections).  




 Why won't Falcon-senpai notice me? 




 The only model of the 3DS that's compatible with amiibo is the New 3DS XL. The only amiibo compatible games for the N3DS are Smash Bros 3DS (Which works with every amiibo except Splatoon and Toad, so far), Code Name S.T.E.A.M. (which works with the Fire Emblem amiibos, so don't even trip cause you won't get your hands on one of those), Ace Combat Assault: Horizon Legacy (which works with most amiibos), and Xenoblade Chronicles 3D (Which only works with Shulk. In other words, no amiibo compatibility)

[here's](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/compatibility) the compatibility chart 




 Is that Dark Link a different figure? 




 For publicity. The utter ridiculousness (and yet appropriateness) of a porn site sponsoring a player brings in traffic.  




 "pretty good argument for legalizing murder"? 




 Is that one of those things that they're gonna patch in? Eventually? 









 Maybe I can go Ganon with a sponsorship from /r/spacedicks 




 What, that Sheik is actually not the epitome of manliness and testosterone with a pair of testicles big enough to make a Goron jealous? What else would he be, the Princess in disguise? That would be funny.  




 better nerf ^^/funnyandoriginal 




 Because he's the only furry that's cool. He has an AT field 10/10 




 That Sheik dude has a nice man-ass. For someone with a Y chromosome.  




 When are these coming to America?  




 You guys know you want me.  




 Same reason as Fakku 




 Looks like I need to learn Ganondorf and go after Pornhub.  




 I always hated how he beat Godzilla, though. 




 Did the kid die in a coal mine?  




 I want to give my friend a vinyl record of the Watergate tapes and I don't know where to go.  




 This should be on *my* desk 




 Cthulhuphant? 




 It's not (just) that you can't see where your feet are. It's that you have next to no spacial awareness that third person (or in the case of real life, your other senses) can provide.  




 Also because, you know, raisins in ice cream.  




 Why ban Afro Samurai?  




 I'll agree with you on the art style. Mirror's Edge makes for some *damn* nice screenshots. And the first person perspective does allow the player to appreciate it. But I just don't understand how people enjoy *playing* it. Platforming in a first person perspective just doesn't work as well as in third person.  




 [real question] Why do people like the gameplay so much? Platforming in first person is such a terrible idea, and it's not like Mirror's Edge executes it in a manner that redeems it.  




 Mechagamera? 




 *sigh* Ganon and ZSS are gonna be unicorns, aren't they?

At least I can still have Doc and Bowser Jr

...hopefully.  




 Someone's never seen /r/Slutoon

Though to be honest, I wish I hadn't either.  




 He doesn't tip on his shawarma.  









 I want to train Pac-Man. I'm good at Mewtwo and Rosalina.  




 Yeah, it seems like OP wouldn't have gotten Akame's number if it weren't for Sakura. So this is absolutely a positive outcome.  




 This is why I'm ashamed to tell people I like anime. These fuckers ruined an entire medium. I kinda wanna go burn my Evangelion DVDs now. 




 Mecha cosplay is the best cosplay.  




 Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann! Robots the size of the observable universe throwing down using *fucking galaxies* as weapons. 

Also, Evangelion. EoE (and to a lesser extent, the TV ending) is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen, even though the show started out kinda rocky. 

And Gunbuster. Episode 6 is just... fuck. EDIT: In a good way.  




 2077: Pokemon Mystery Dungeon 




 Agreed. Bayonetta 2 has to be the best single player game on the Wii U right now. 




 Please let it be Bayonetta, please let it be Bayonetta, please let it be Bayonetta, please let it be Bayonetta.. 




 Old blueman: 

New blueman: :(

What happened, America? 




 I thought I was an ear of butter! 




 Arceus, as one should always keep the Lord in their heart 




 It's like End of Evangelion with more mindfuck.  




 seeing internet strangers give each other precious metals.  




 [better picture](http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3i7pnnso41qjklx2o1_1280.jpg) 




 Yep. [You need this to use it](http://m4sv.com/page/wii-u-gcn-usb-driver) 




 his taunts would be the first to deal damage to the player 




  A government weaponizing Arceus, the literal God of creation, is downright terrifying.

Vatican too OP Game Freak pls nerf 




 Wow it's like no one wants a Charizard. I'd be glad to have it.  




 Earthbound is freakin' sweet. Whoever gets it is gonna have a field day.  




 MattyB, a white kid who thinks he can rap. his parents (and more importantly, their wallets) agree.  




 There are **REASONS** why it can't be a Mexican standoff!  




 Man finally getting my hands on Charizard would be sweet 




 Yours is the railgun that's gonna pierce the heavens! 




 Im totally stealing it.  




 The area is gray in a one two three way.  




 To be fair, that's on a window. Anyone who looks out that window is gonna see "niggaZ". The real question is why no one thought of that when they first did it.  




 Does Rami-chan even have boobs? 




 You're not a tycoon! 




 She's heavy because she's a god damn giant. Who has galaxies up her dress.  




 What happens when it goes over nine tho-


Fuck it. I'm above that joke.  




 Did you hack Linux, Java? 




 Wisconsin needs to go back to Canada where it belongs. 




 I want to watch the Granny Sexbang episode but I'm not sure my cold heart can handle it.  




 Maybe we can play some Project M with this 




 Kiryu's one of my favorite mecha, but I can't seem to find any model kits of him. Am I just not looking in the right places? 









 That's the reblogger. THEY probably did it as a joke.  




 Has Arin taught you nothing
