 An American black female who was in my command when I was in the Navy jumped all over her white, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, male shipmate when he casually mentioned he was an African-American.  She couldn't grasp the difference between country of origin/nationality vs race.  She also went so far as to prevent another shipmate from listening to a radio program that she found offensive when she happened to drop by his work station.  Seems she didn't like it hearing Louis Farrahkan referred to as "Calypso Louie" by the black radio host, Ken Hamblin and no, she was not Muslim.  So much for protecting the Constitution and the rights of free speech!      




 Why?
 




 Well that not exactly Southern is it?  Mashed taters or mac and cheese is were it's at!
 




 I know, beans right?  My bite he gave me however, convinced me otherwise!
  









 Poke holes before adding toppings.   




 Concur.
 




 Were are you from and why are you making a "Southern" dinner? 




 Sidewalk fries?
 




 Healthy fresh but then you add the ham or ham hocks and slow cook them until all the nutrients are leached out into the water.   




 Not funny, cute or witty.  Don't post here again.

 People think you're crazy when this sandwich comes up but it's delicious.  Elvis was definitely on to something!  Checkout my appetizer version I did for my culinary school graduation reception.  They were hit!  
 
 




 Thanks.  I think you're right.  Might have to change pharmacies though since my pain meds are pretty strong and they may give me hassles.    




 The prescription was for an opioid pain patch.  I used it for 1 week before I realized it was 7 months past its expiration date.  I don't think I suffered any ill affects and they, happily and apologetically replace the medication.  I'm not looking for a lawsuit/money but I'm concerned because this chain pharmacy has been caught and fined for selling expired OTC medication and food items in another state.  It may have been an honest mistake but because of their previous lawsuit and the fact it was a prescription drug that could have had serious consequences I feel I'm responsible to report it.    




 Back in the day when car bodies were made of metal my car battery died.  I didn't have any cables and nobody else did.  We were in a remote area.  I found an extension cord, split the two wires apart and stripped both ends of one wire.  Found a willing soul and we positioned the cars so that the bumpers touched to create a ground then, with both cars off, I clamped one bare end to the positive terminal from one battery then did the same with the other.  Started car one, let it run, then started mine.  Fired right up!  Can't do that anymore! 









 That's so sweet of you but it must be torture!  The same with me but it's popcorn.  I tell my husband to go ahead a make it for himself but he adamantly refuses to.    




 Nope, pan seared.  I like to get the entire surface of the patty browned.  Gives it more flavor! 









 I don't want to even know lol!
 




 Hot, juicy and tasty! 




 'cause I can! 




 LOl, as a cake decorator I've often felt the same way!

 We had a 19 year old E2 back in '94 who was getting married.  For his wedding he decided to get a bunch of random medals to wear since he only had one.  He promptly got busted especially since he had no clue what they were for (one was for service in Vietnam!)     




 Thank you for your critical response and suggestions.  My mother was an English major and I learned very early, due to her influence, that people that point out grammatical errors are trying to compensate for a lack of understanding or intelligent response.  




 Probably better! 




 Sorry, lots of comments to sift through.  What's your question? 




 Glad I could help! 




 I'm an atheist.  




 Yes, yes I can.  Why in the world would you want to see my shit? 




 Do you really want me to document the entire circle of life? 




 As a cook, my son and I have had in depth discussions concerning the logistical placement of condiments and ingredients on a Burger.  




 Glad to hear the good news.  Interestingly the South American word for an avocado means testies or low hanging fruit!   




 Totally surprised myself! 




 say.......what? 




 Did it on purpose. 




 I'm a woman so........ 




 American, yes.  Texan, yes and yes! lol 




 How do you know?  I'm the one that ate it.  
Sorry that no one will make or share a burger with you.  To be honest that's what makes burgers, hot dogs and steaks taste great is having someone to share it with.  If you want me to share my burger then let me know.

 No ketchup, pickle, tomato.  Plus pretzel bun, creole mustard, saute'd mushrooms.   




 Ya know! 




 Creole mustard 




 Creole mustard.  I like your description though. 




 Only four : ( 




 Creole mustard.  




 Wow!  First time to make the front of the front page!  Thanks everybody for all the likes.  I'll try to go through all the comments when I get some extra time.  




 Not only that but it was a homemade sausage recipe cranked out in my little 25 year old kitchenAid! 




 Heel from pretzel bun, smear of mayo, seasoned beef patty, American cheese, thick-cut Applewood smoked bacon, pork sausage patty, Swiss cheese, saute'd mushrooms in Balsamic glaze and minced garlic, creole mustard and the crown from the pretzel bun. 




 Oh Lord J^* s!  Season and boil your water.  Add thawed shrimp and stir until they turn pink, usually 2 to 5 minutes.  Remove and shock.     









 In your dreams.  Spent 9 years in New Orleans plus lived along the gulf coast.  When you cook shrimp to the point that they form an O then they're overcooked!   




 Shrimp is overcooked.
 




 Do you have anything to cook in?

 I used to take a box of Triscuits, shavings of cheddar cheese and drizzle Sriracha on top.  Before Sriracha was Triscuits, mustard, cheese and dill pickles.  Damn, now I'm hungry!      




 Try dribbling some Sriracha on it!   




 You're welcome.  The best advise I got from a cajun and chili-head is make sure every layer you add to a dish adds either flavor or texture.  For instance, instead of adding just water, even if you're just making Kraft Mac and Cheese, add chicken stock instead of water.  Add some of your spices at the beginning but leave some to throw in at the end.  For texture add some of your veggies from the beginning for aromatics but add additional toward the end for taste and texture.   




 Tried to waffle some KD to go with my burger.  What do you think?

 I don't like to give away all my secrets but here's my general spice packet plus aromatics to 1lbs dried beans or 60 oz canned red beans, Blue Runner of course.

Equal parts black, white and red(cayenne) pepper, 1 tsp ea.
Dried thyme and oregano, 2 Tbsp ea.
Bay leaves, 2
Hot sauce, 1 tsp
Worcestershire, 1 tsp
salt to taste

Onions, green and red bell pepper, minced fresh garlic.

Plus Andouillie sausage(diced), pickled pork(diced) and tasso(minced). 




 Oh my, what a big seed you have! 




 What's "wrong" about yours? 




 KD? 




 (Serious research) What are or were your favorite things to eat or most creative things you've made while stoned?  




 Look like the yolk is trying to give the bun a hug.  




 Potatoes are beautiful things plus you can make vodka from them.  Try to do that with a steak! 




 Thanks!  I like to put pickled pork in my beans but I have to drive pretty far to get it so I make a huge batch and freeze smaller portions.  Sure do miss a lot of things about New Orleans! 




 As an old cook in the Navy I say job well done mate!  I like just a little glaze on mine so I can admire the rings of filling and golden brown rolls but that just my preference.  

I think your portioning was okay but doing it your way makes it hard to get a nice clean slice without "sealing" the cut edges.  This is one reason rolls will bolt up in the middle.                         Before you cut the rolls, refrigerate it covered in plastic for 15 minutes.  This firms up the dough and butter so it won't squish down and the filling doesn't squeeze out.  Using your handy dandy ruler mat as a guide and a very sharp long knife cut your rolls while using your other hand to gently maintain the shape of the roll.  Try not to end up with a  shaped roll but if you do just lightly lay it down and round it out.
Use a bigger pan.  Your rolls are too close together!  They should almost double in size with the second rising.  Also, when you originally roll the dough up, do so as loosely as you can.  That will allow the rolls to expand.  Roll it too tight and they won't proof correctly and can also cause the middle to bolt up.
Just some words of advise from an old salty cook.  Can't wait to see the next batch!  




 Nice job!
 




 Hope you left some for her! 




 You can't "fry" using soy sauce since it contains no oil.  Simmer, boil or poach maybe but not fry.  Even butter has too much water to fry all though I heard of some that have used margarine however, since margarine is just one molecule away from being a plastic I wouldn't.  




 I'd like a cherry pie tree too!  I'd settle for a fruit cocktail tree though. 









 I think it's a work of art and so good!  I hope my friend, Rowdy Dugan is successful with his business!  I bake too but back pain keeps me out of the professional arena for now.  As far as the cherry clafoutis, it's the first thing I make when cherries are in season.

 Why?
 














 Eating the rice? Yes it does lol! 









 Even as a chef, when I eat out I pay to have that another chef treat me.  I can always come up with my own stuff and definitely won't pay higher prices just because they have the ingredients on hand! 




 True. Most homeowners/renters insurance covers loss of power usually up to $500.  Don't know if they would cover it because of a defective refrigerator though.  When I lost power for barely over 24 hours I called my insurance company.  They did not send an adjuster out, just began asking what I'd lost.  Rattled off a bunch of expensive cheeses, charcuterie, shellfish, all kinds of imported olives etc.  She asks if I'm a chef, "yes", I tell her and bingo, she awards me the full amount!  Pretty much just had the basics, less than $75.   I know, I'm bad. 




 This just indicates the owner/chef is to lazy or uneducated to create their own salad combinations.  Nothing but a salad bar. 









 Round har we call potatoes taters as in tater salad or tots.               ; )   https://youtu.be/neUaSTSKFZc  









 Looks as though all the chefs got a raging case of diarrhea and the dishwasher had to step in and cook/plate from memory!  Though I know some dishwashers that can plate better lol!
 




 Ohhh YES! 




 Strongly concur.  Never let chicken or turkey come to room temperature! 




 Beautiful bowls of gravy!  Good Job!

 7th generation Texan here.  We say pies and bucks.  One thing I've never seen is someone putting Ranch on pizza!  Seriously, why? Hope they're just dipping the pizza bones in it. The closest I've seen are Mississippians who put Catalina dressing on pizza.
