 Umm... If this isn't something you're comfortable talking about I totally get that, but if you would be, any change we could get the full story? 




 I moved in with my best friend and his girlfriend last June, my first apartment outside of my parents house. It has not been... great. just typed the following in facebook chat: 
[Tue Apr 24 2012 12:15:14 AM] Verbal27: I feel like I'm going to vomit because I just ate most of a box of penne pasta. Why did I do this? Because I wanted spaghetti but I was out and I noticed [McDouche] and [Lady McDouche] had like 9 different boxes of the same three kinds of pasta, that they clearly kept forgetting that they bought already and kept re buying. So i thought of the snide remark [McDouche] would make upon finding some of his pasta consumed "See you got into the pene there, we were uh... actually lookin at maybe using that for dinner tonight." And I thought of the glee I would feel upon pointing out the hypocrisy and falseness of that statement. So I cooked, and I ate, beyond my capacity. In short, I just hate fucked a box of my former best friends pasta with my mouth

Thinking it may be time to find a new living situation. What are some of your best "Weeelp, time to be hittin the ole dusty trail" stories? 




 My first time seeing it. Get over yourself. 




 I guess that's a matter of perspective. I'm by no means a prude about what i watch online, but the mindset of a person who would want to do that is one of the lower forms of filth we have to offer. 




 Is...is... is that a thing? 




 If I may ask, would you mind sharing your story? If not, I understand. 




 To be fair I was 9 pages deep in res and still on posts from today, that's gonna take a while to get through 




 It's not exactly the same concept. I obviously have no intention of ever having anything to do with him again, but I have deeply emotional and personal memories with him that are all tainted now. It's not just something I kind of enjoyed, this was someone who had a profound influence on my life. 




 In High School, my friend, we'll call him A (I don't give a fuck about his anonymity, you'll find out why in a second, but I do want to keep within guidelines) was the one person who was there for me by my side through everything. We met pretty soon after I transferred in my sophomore year, and were best of friends since then. He was like a brother to me and it's a stupid cliche but I would have taken a bullet for him. We had a bit of a falling out after I went to college and weren't as close but I still considered him one of my closest friends and we kept in touch until about midway through senior year. 

Late last year I found out why we fell out of touch, he was arrested on 16 counts of possessing and distributing child porn. He was sentenced last month to four years in jail, much to lenient in my opinion.

Reddit, I just can't reconcile this. He was a brother to me and all of a sudden he's this despicable piece of human filth. I can't stop hating him for this, when people around me are telling me he has a sickness and I should pity him. Have any of you had an experience like this where your image of someone was completely and irrevocably shattered. How did you reconcile the old experiences with the new person? Can you even?

TL;DR High school best friend turns out to be CP loving scumbad, can't figure out how to deal.  




 Makes sense. Thanks! 




 Don't most novelty accounts also have a primary account?  




 Anyone notice rediquette says don't complain about reposts? 




 I have no desire for his death, but kim jong un is a fascist with no leadership qualifications who will lead his country to oblivion. 




 Just playing Devils advocate a little and this probably won't even be read. 
Also full disclosure, I may be biased because I had already pre ordered the special edition.

This is obviously a marketing strategy by ea and its kind of shitty but ea didn't make the game, bioware did. People who have been crafting this story through three games are the one who built these, and I trust that they wouldn't have anything taken out that was story essential, ala exiled prince or kasumi and zaed.

Just my thoughts but I could be very wrong. We'll see in 2 weeks. 
 




 If you don't have any objections, I'm using that for [/r/MercWithAMouth](/r/MercWithAMouth) first one anyone's suggested that i really like 




 Done 




 We can coexist.  




 ...M...Margaret?  




 Went to downvote, double checked username to be safe, switched to upvote.  




 Have an upvote anyway. 




 Same here. See my Depression AMA. Sorry you had to go through that, if you ever need anyone to talk to... 




 But what happened to the noodles? 




 Dave? 




 Hot glue is the devil. Especially in a public school system where science teachers don't know their subject so all of your classes are building shit.  




 Commenting to save the link as I dont have RES at work 









 Witch! Burn Him! 




 How about Kevin Smith? One of the most influential writers of gen x. Grew as a director from film to film ending most recently with his crowning achievement visually, Red State. Created an entire podcasting network while making a movie and touring the country.

Also seems to be a legitimately nice guy who's very passionate about his work and his fans 









 Absolutely. Not arguing that at all.  




 Afghanistan. An organization from that Country did attack us.  




 Gonna work through it, Thanks! 




 Lol. I'm just contrite when contrition is called for.  




 Yes passed, but I'm talking about lack of a veto.  




 Ok this time I legitimately am apologizing, Just had an asshole customer so was pissed off. Didn't need to come at you like that.  




 I can see that definitely, but support of NDAA and probable support of SOPA, which is implied by signing into law, crosses a line in the values that I voted for .  




 Ok, but in that same school can you take some classes in sarcasm too? 




 My two big ones are gay marriage and his tax plan. Allegedly he's gonna be cutting major taxes to the top 1% of earners. Can you talk about that and where he stands in his tax policy? 




 Sorry I didn't meet your standards. Maybe another time. 

Edit: Was it the one where I talked about trying to commit suicide? Cause I'm sorry but that one kills at parties. 




 Romney is one of the one's I'm strongly looking at, I do have some questions about some of his more fundamentalist ideologies but I do like a lot of hist governmental stances.  




 Sorry, I'll be in the corner 




 No prob, just when you have time. Thanks! 




 What are you basing that on? Again, not challenging, what about these guys leads you to believe they are that fundamentally similar to the bushes etc of the past?
