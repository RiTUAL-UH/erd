 with the most recent changes i had a feeling that ap's were going to be weaker. but after the update i feel like they have only gotten stronger early which is what needed to be done in the game as thats what a mage is supposed to be. 




 alright missions your best bet is this page here. http://www.naruto-boards.com/953198/ its gotten me around 10 characters. now for climbing you need to look into all the old characters there have been some major changes. EX lee no longer has 2 different builds its now 2 different characters. kin no longer infinitely stacks damage on people she now has conditional skills on skill targeting. and ten ten no longer deals over time aoe she can now stack damage and reduce damage that target deals in an aoe fashion but once a turn. another thing is that chouji no longer deals 300% on his 3rd pill its now a flat damage for his skils ranging from 20+ on his hand one (cant remember name) and 10+ on his roll invuln the invulnerability on it doesnt block healing so you can take sakura S on chouji team and heal him when hes invuln while eating a pill. thats going to be all i can really tell you i really reccomend looking into all characters with this http://nahelp.webs.com/Nahelper.swf  




 i mean i can get 22 kills 2 deaths and only get an s- with it being a 20-30 minute game. it varies champion to champion based on how well others do with that champion. 




 your sorta supposed to die with a team around. that way your first death will only put you in a better position for a team fight.
