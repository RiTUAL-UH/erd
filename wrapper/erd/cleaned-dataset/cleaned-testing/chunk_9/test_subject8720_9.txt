 Oh it's okay I found it! I just typed it in wrong the last time :3 Thank you!! :) 




 Oh my gosh I LOVED Kimi ni Todoke!!!  




 I've been recommended Golden Time a few times so I'm definitely going to watch it now! I really loved My Little Monster as well!
Ano Natsu de Matteru looks good as well! Thank you for your suggestions! :) 




 I had a look around and can't find the anime you're talking about. Do you perhaps know the Japanese title of it or a link to where I can find it?
