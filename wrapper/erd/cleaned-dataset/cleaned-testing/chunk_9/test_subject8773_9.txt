 Very true, good point! 




 That is a really good point. I feel as though we do need to have this conversation, so I can really test and see if she knows how much damage she has done and whether she is really sorry.  




 So my mom doesnt exhibit all nbehaviors, but she was definitely a toxic parent, and I am dealing with a lot of issues because of it.

I had recently (since this past Christmas) gone NC with her after she flipped out and overreacted, which resulted in her kicking me out. You can read the post [here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2qd73m/hyperreligious_nmom_kicked_me_out_today_merry/) and the [update] (http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2qqznd/hyperreligious_nmom_kicked_me_out_today_merry/) I posted afterwards.

Anyway, this morning she called, and I had deleted her number, and didn't recognize it, so I answered. She called saying that she wanted to apologize for her actions and that what she did wasnt right, and that God wanted her to reflect and apologize to me. She told me that she would like my forgiveness, but she understands if I don't give it. 

Here's the thing, though. I was ready to ignore her completely, and to not call her on Mother's Day, her birthday, or on holidays. I wasn't going to invite her to my college graduation next spring because she's done nothing but make my college experience much harder with all of the emotional abuse and manipulation. She's treated me so badly that I cannot just let her have access into my life, or an opportunity to let me down. She's beat on me and has always been much harsher to me than the other kids in my family for no reason. Its just so confusing though, because she's given me a sincere apology, and unprovoked, as far as I know. 

I am starting to feel guilt already at the thought of maintaining NC/VLC after this. And I'm very suspicious. My brother just left to go to boot camp, and I keep thinking that this is a way to get one of her adult children back into her life, since she's got a 14 year old, 8 year old, and a 5 year old, along with a deadbeat husband who offers her barely any support emotionally or financially back home.

I'm just....really hesitant because I don't want to fall back into the guilting, and the manipulation, and the lack of boundaries. 

Can anyone offer some insight about this? 




 Wow, writing a book, especially a book of poetry is something to be proud of! I'm sorry that you couldn't be proud of it the way you wanted to be :/ 




 Yeah :/ I feel you. Thank you for the hugs 




 I scored an 8 and shit like this makes me wonder how I turned out so relatively normal. I should be dead or nearly dead by now 




 My mother is half black, and so I'm a quarter black. This matters to the story, trust me. 

She was talking about how she got the best parts about being both white and black: her lips are full but not too much, her skin is a nice mocha color, she has thick hair but it can grow long, etc. Puke, I know.

I, being 11 at the time, wanting my mother's approval and a link to her obviously superior genetics, asked, "What about my lips, mama, are they nice too? I think the'yre shaped just like yours." And then i smiled at her. 

She looks at me and says, "Hm, well your top lip is pretty thin." My face instantly fell. 

She was always annoyed by my low self-esteem growing up, too. It was obviously because there was something wrong with me that I was just refusing to fix, it didnt come about because of constant shit like this. No, never. Baffling. 




 Wow...this sounds almost exactly like my situation. I was kicked out on Christmas day because my mom told me and my impressionable younger sister that women needed to cook and clean and were not allowed to rest, and the men should sit around and relax all day. When I complained, she flew off the handle. I also have younger siblings, four younger, and it's hard not being there with them to protect them, but they know I love them. It gets better.  




 Yeah, i thought about that one, and I'm just going to keep saying to her that I am only here for my brother and that her hugging/fake praise/whatever other bullshit she pulls is making me uncomfortable. I'm also going to send her a text the day before establishing my purposes and that we don't have a relationship to speak of so she should not pretend as if there were one.   




 I have a family event coming up where my mother (who i am NC with) will be as well.

My therapist told me to treat her like a yapping dog: 

You don't walk into a room where a yappy dog is barking and think "oh no, the dog is barking a lot, what did I do to make it bark??" right? You realize the dog will bark because that's what it does, no matter what you do. You also don't refrain from socializing with the ones you love in a room with a little yappy dog just because it's barking. You're not afraid of it because it's just noise, and it has no power over you. 

This helps me immensely when preparing to go into possible situations where my mom is going to be. At worst, when she decides to hop on the crazy train, it comes off more as an annoyance than a traumatic, emotional event. Hope this helps someone else too :) 




 Good advice, will definitely be doing this. 




 That's a good idea. He lives about four hours away from me, so I have to get a ride into town and then stay with my boyfriend's parents for the weekend. I could try and get him out to dinner with me or something beforehand
 




 All I have to say is, I'm glad I'm not the only one. I'm generally very outgoing and love to talk to people, but I get this "vibe" from people that they don't want to hear what I have to say, or I am the "weird person" in the group after I start talking about something. I'm not sure if my social skills are off or if I have anxiety left over from when my mom would sigh and interrupt me in the middle of me talking about something and talk about something unrelated that she wanted to say, totally just ignoring every contribution I ever gave. Probably a combination of both.

It's actually converted me from being extremely willing to meet new people and have a conversation with someone I just met to me holing myself up in my room and feeling nauseous and scared to talk to people or look them in the eye while im at university. Super awesome, thank you nparentalunit 




 You did the right thing. But remember: he doesn't deserve *better*, he deserves something *different* that suits his needs and desires better. You also deserve that.

Just because you don't want kids does not make you lesser, it just means that there are better people suited to the lifestyle he wants, and the same goes for you.

I know that doesn't make it any easier, and it sucks that you had to give up a good relationship. Sorry that this happened to you :/ 




 You can get yourself emancipated, like everyone else is saying, OR if you don't want to go through the legal process, and you are just worried about the FAFSA, there is an option on it saying that you cannot provide your parents' information, because they are abusive. Usually schools will help you go through a dependency override process, as long as you are no longer living with that parent. If you can live with a friend during breaks or something, I would do that. 

I am going through the same situation right now. During breaks, I live with my boyfriend's parents and work, and for the school year I live off of loans and scholarships and grants. I filled out a dependency override form, and the process was fairly painless. All i had to do was write a statement, get someone not related to me (like a cop, a counselor, or such) to write a statement, and then I got my boyfriend's mom to write one. VOILA! No contact since then. 









 I can only imagine what that child sounds like, and it's making me cringe. That said, I think this is a pretty cute way to announce a pregnancy, unless they made her cry on purpose 




 Haha, I love your flair! 




 That's very true. I love RBN, it's how I found you guys! 




 It's nice to hear from someone who has a fairly "normal" life without tons of vacations. I dont think my bf and I will be able to travel as much as some either but it doesn't really matter. No kids! Thank you :) 




 Haha, I love this 




 So happy for you that you're making it! It must have been pretty hard losing all of that saved up money, but at least youre not in debt up to your eyeballs. Good for you! 




 Yeah, and even though there are posts that have a lot of hate in them and I don't agree with everything everyone says here (that happens when youre an adult in an adult world), I still think we should have a place where we can put those feelings. We aren't evil. Those here who hate kids don't hate them in a "KILL ALL THE CHILDREN!!" way, just in the sense that they're annoying and parents seem to encourage that behavior a lot nowadays. 




 I'm relatively new here, and I just found out that this subreddit actually has a really bad reputation.

I just have to say that surprises me! Even though we have a lot of people who absolutely hate kids period, we have people who are living the CF lifestyle and just wish people who are parents would stop being assholes. And it's kind of a nice little support group when we feel alone or out of touch with the childbearing population.

I have to say that I am so thankful that this sub exists. I was already not feeling the whole having children thing, but this sub helped me to realize that I was making the right choice and I wasn't alone in feeling this way. It's saved me $250,000 and maybe even more than that if I were to have more than one child because I felt as though I was "missing out" or if I would have let the bingo-ing get to me. You guys have saved my life as I know it, and I am so grateful. 

Not to mention, there have been maybe a few examples of parental regret that I've heard of before this subreddit, but I went through the top posts of this subreddit, and I've found so many examples of parents who regret having their kids. I've never heard of a CF person who regrets it. 

So you guys keep doing you! Thanks for being here! :) 




 Haha, well he's a game design major and it's sort of his mecca. I just want to be somewhere where the sun is shining, the people are diverse and weird, and I don't have to deal with these miserable winters. It'll be expensive but worth it. :) 




 Rock on! Aunties/Uncles who spoil their nieces/nephews unite! 




 This is hilarious. I would be a much better pet owner than kid owner. We plan to have furry babies of our own one day :) 




 Exactly! 




 ...between liking kids and wanting kids of your own. I'm not a child hater in any sense of the word. I see a baby at a restaurant and I freak out over how cute it is. I see toddlers running around at a park and it makes me smile. I love babysitting.

But I would never, EVER, have kids of my own. The thought of it makes me cringe so hard. If I were to get pregnant, I know that I would abort it, and not regret that decision. I've had a couple scares before where I was ready to make an appointment. All my girl friends say they couldnt fathom the idea of having a baby now, but they do want kids someday. For me, there is no someday. I don't get excited about the prospect of having kids. Rather, it makes me feel as though the day I give birth to a child is the day I give up my life and my freedom.

I may feel this way because I grew up being a mother-figure to my four younger siblings, and the fact that my own mother was a terrible parent, but it doesn't matter. The reason I feel this way does not change that I FEEL THIS WAY. 

I hate it when people say "I've seen the way you are with kids, it would be such a WASTE if you weren't a mom!" or "You love kids, how could you not want any of your own??" Especially when it's people who I have expressed my child-free feelings towards.

Also, I have a serious boyfriend, and people always say to me that it would be such a shame if we didnt have kids because we are such a good couple. I'm fairly sure we are a good couple because we do things for each other that ease each other's stress as much as we can, and one of those things is that we don't have or want kids. I am 100 percent sure that bringing kids into the equation would change our relationship entirely, and I am not going to give our amazing relationship up. That does not make me a selfish person, either.

Luckily, even though I am only 20, I've met someone who also doesn't want kids, and he wants to marry me and travel the world with me and wants to get the hell out of the midwest and end up in the fabulous city of LA. I cannot say how much of a relief it is to have him. As long as we are on the same page, all the rest of that shit we put up with doesn't matter, honestly.
