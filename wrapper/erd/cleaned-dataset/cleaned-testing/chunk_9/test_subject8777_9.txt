 Use the term musician very lightly.. Your music sucks and to say youre a musician makes me sick for myself and other true musicians that know how to play instruments and compose music in it's truest form and have spent most of our lives dedicated to an actual instrument.. Not behind a fucking computer screen pushing buttons and twisting knobs.. Learn some scales or some paradiddles.. In your own words, "glorified button pushing"... 









 This dog is a winner.. Bc he's a rescue

 I wouldn't mind seeing her naked from back then, before she grew a penis 




 You worked as a small time studio.. Impressive

 Why the fuck is this front page... I have a dog too... Big fucking whoop 




 Machoism is big in India.. I would not have guessed with it being as religious as a region as it is.. Can you explain a little more? 




 My buddy said you should watch the documentary called unhung hero.. It's about a guy with a small penis who gets dumped by his gf for having a small penis and then travels the country to see if his penis really is too small... I want to watch it now! 




 And don't trip man, I'm still single with a regular sizes penis haha.. You will find someone as cool as you soon enough! 




 I appreciate you answering my questions man. If I ever make it to India, first lap dance is on me brotha! 




 Tornados have always fascinated me, ever since I was a kid and I remember my parents getting this tornado home movies for me as a kid off of tv infomercials.. What I want to know is:

1. How did you curiosity for storms lead you to actually decide to start chasing them?

2. Any near death experiences, and if so, please explain.

3. Do you ever think about the fact that you are putting yourself in harms way and if so, do you chalk it up to doing it for science?

4. What's the gnarliest storm you have chased or witnessed?

5. What is it about storms that fascinate you the most?

6. After seeing all the destruction from storms, ever considering living in an area that doesn't have them as serve like say San Diego?

7. If I pay for my own way, can I come on a ride along for a week!?

Thanks so much! Looking forward to reading these!  




 Do you know if your father has a small penis.. Is it something that can run in a family? Are you mad at all about it? 




 Could u get a vape pen and be discrete? Do you have to give the costume back at the end of each day? If not, burn hard in that bitch and then take it to a dry cleaner.. Just so you can say you did it haha.. Bt that's just my old stoner tendencies talking haha 




 Are you a bigger guy? Do you have an outty belly button and if so is it bigger than your penis? 




 For a second I thought you said "some girls that actually saw it and BLACKED out" I was like, now that is some power right there 




 Bro, same shit happens to me because I had long hair and looked like a stoner.. It's not just you because you're black.. Having that attitude gives the cops the upper hand because you constantly feel like a victim.. Sack up and just deal, you're not being treated any different then the rest of us 




 Jay, How do you know they guys from trailer park boys? Your part on swearnet cracked me up 




 I want to know tips and itineraries from someone who has no money like myself.. Not someone who has lots of money and just travels around because they can.. You are pretty much like my parents.. Travel for a year with 5k and then do an AMA.. I'll wait. 




 Ever hot box that carrot suit? I feel I'd have to be soooo high to get thru the day? Or drunk.. 




 I was a sandwich artist when I was in high school bt my artistic expression was stifled, so I quit.. That and I was eating free sandos

 Hey, fuck your stupid cat..

 I'd get a big ass knife from my kitchen... You can make anything into a weapon if you are smart enough 




 Fuck cats 




 I am a subscriber to r/watchpeopledie and that was one of the harder things for me to watch.. 




 Couldn't have said it better myself  




 Yea... I don't know if you know what's going on in the Middle East.. Bt terrorist and "police" factions have been killing innocent people for years now that have no weapon and a lot of times are children...so it's not just America where people are getting killed who are unarmed..
