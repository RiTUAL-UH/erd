 You live near the U of M area or Bartlett by any chance? 




 Live between Memphis and Jackson,Tn. All I can say is stay away from East Jackson, Orange Mound and East St.Louis.
Anyone know about Paducah? 




 So what about McFarlane or Shadowhawk or Erik Larsen or Mark Bagley,etc.?
 




 Uh no. Pick up Suicide Squad 1 from 1987.
Nu-52 Suicide Squad is shit. 




 Someone has been watching UHF. 




 Faith No More remake? 




 I know it's weird as fuck to say, but when you live in the south and you hear it every single day you end up saying it yourself.
I had to ween myself from saying it. 




 This is the first generation model that came with a hard drive in 2009. 




 Taco Bell? 




 Nope. Can confirm. Friend works at a Coca-Cola bottling plant and he got wrote up for eating Taco Bell cause they are owned by Pepsico. 




 If you work for Coca-Cola you can also get fired for eating at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. 









 You just watched this on Netflix too? 




 37? 




 Savage Dragon is still good. P.S. I enjoyed Shadowhawk. 




 Fuck no. I'm talking about the comments in this thread. 
A potato ban is necessary with the shit attitudes and neckbeardisms. 




 Grandparents. Honestly, Microsoft still updates it and 8 people in the United States still use it. 




 Saying go get a job is easier to say than to find one. 




 For a cheeseburger? 




 Link? 




 Teethy blowjob makes my dick sore. I got a few and my cock was sore for days. 




 Potatoes offend me. Somebody ban them. 




 Guess my old neighborhood is the hood now (Frayser). 




 God dammit Frank take that rug off.

 [Wait til you see his Jello commercial....](https://youtu.be/MHpUMCrnUNE) 




 Caught my dad cheating on my mom once. 




 I want that poster but live so far away.... 




 Amazon Women On The Moon. 




 Is that the Egon from the Real Ghostbusters cartoon? 




 Just like your mother, Trebeck! 









 How far from Corinth or Tupelo was this store at? 




 The fedora is strong with this one. 




 I got banned from working at every Wal-Mart on the planet. 




 Seen some retarded kid jump out the water and stab someone. 




 Blade returns in Capt.America : Civil War. 




 http://www.neckbeard-news.com/2014/04/wisconsin-man-tips-waitress-with-fedora.html#.VZ6qq19Viko I'm dying. 




 I concur with this gentleman's statement. 




 Must have been me. I farted. 




 I may have said this long ago but I really think I ate breakfast with a serial killer once. 




 That's the thing about DC. They only care about the now instead of the when and what. 
You have tons of cosmic entities and artifacts that the DC Universe writers don't use. 
I mean DC has the Human Squirrel and Fireworks Man.  




 It also explains where these superheroes come from. No conscious  being appears out of nowhere unless there is an explanation for it. 
It's a really powerful device and not one writer has even delved into the backstory.
 




 Nah. Phantom Stranger isn't obscure. But I have a fan theory about one obscure DC hero. I really do think this makes sense.
Dial H For Hero : That dial is a cosmic multiversale construct on the same level as the Time Knife, the Book Of Crime, the Omni-Gauntlets,etc.
The Dial possessor switches places with a hero on Earth H. It's a very very powerful multiversal device on par with the Ultimate Nullifier. We just haven't seen the full potential of it yet. 




 You're god damn right. 




 I hope you burn! 




 Say My Name. 




 What is your favorite obscure DC character?
I have two that is obscure : Detective Karp and Kana the Shadow Warrior. 




 I'm old school. I prefer Karl Malone or Charles Barkley.
Shaq was a horrible 3 point shot though. 




 I really think you shit in a bag to throw the police K-9 unit away from your meth lab.
Trust me. It works. 




 Filthy bastard! 




 You sick fuck! 




 Eugene here knows what started the dead to rise. 




 You monster!

 Hitler was your real dad. Him and Ava never committed suicide. 









 I converted just for the jokes. 




 I'm never gonna give you up. 




 In each and every one of us lives a spooky skeleton. 




 They are minerals. 




 I was playing casual MTG few days ago and every guy (natural fedora wearing neckbeard) I play against always talked shit about my deck and bragged about how much they spend,etc. 
It turned me off really quick when you sit down at a casual game and the fedora wearing fuck is playing is competitive deck he uses on FNM.
It's pathetic and annoying. 




 Bolivar,Tn? Absolutely the shittest town in Tennessee. 




 Really damn good. 




 Someone got their fedora on too tight today. 




 Another reason why I don't play MTG. It's more about the money instead of the gameplay.  




 Was the company Subway? 




 Holy fuck. 




 I thought of Devo De-Evolution when I saw that tat. 




 Didn't know this store existed. 




 wonder if people that find them will give them back to him.

The fedora is strong with you. 




 New Lobo is the New Coke of DC Comics.

 Fucking the pillows again, Bobby Digital? 




 Squash Relish. It's good. 




 It's so bad that the art and writing is fucking hilarious. Because Liefeld. 




 [If only you seen the pornhub comments](http://pornhubcommentsonstockphotos.tumblr.com/image/78483299274) 




 Two words : Freedom Fries. 




 Was that guy a zombie or just a survivor? 




 1) Fuck the outside. I live in a cesspool of a small town where crackheads vagabond about. Wide-eyed from the hit of a crackrock and asking for Camels and a ride to "that fat bitches double-wide on the corner"

2) Fuck reading. My local Library is a hellhole of religious lit, 50 Shades Of Sticking Things Up Her Ass and Vampire erotica. No Phillip K. Dick. No more Stephen King. But tons of Needlepoint books.

3) Fuck visiting friends. It's tough at 36 keeping up with your friends when half of them are dead, married, in jail, out of state, wives won't let them talk to you or their god damn kids are keeping the poor bastards busy. Fuck visiting relatives. They are all in the same description as above.

4) Fuck volunteering. Half the nursing home is dead, nearest hospital is 20 miles away and all the retarded people got nurses to wipe their potato asses.

5) Fuck taking classes. Our shit tech center is overfilled with assholes and the teachers don't fucking teach. They chit chat and help you sound out words but NOOOOOO they cannot help you with muthafucking algebra.

6) Fuck learning a new language. Bitch, I know Pig Latin and a few Spanish words like Taco, Burrito, Aqua, etc. All them Mexican words with silent letters n shit.

7) Fuck writing a book. Bitch I got writers block,

8) Fuck new hobbies. I aint got no money to buy god damn RC Cars and hacky sacks and muthafucking bows n arrows and shit.

9) Fuck marathons. Bitch I got asthma.

10) Fuck cooking. Around these parts, you ask somebody to help you cook and you end up with a detective at your door asking you  questions about meth and shit. Muthafucka, do I look like some damn Walter White? Bitch, do I own a car wash?

11) Fuck driving the elderly. Those old fucks always forget what they want when you take them to Piggly Wiggly and shit. Always calling me at 3 am asking me to change their depends and shit. Bitch, they can change themselves.

Suggestions my ass!! 




 Fuck Tumblr. 




 I doubt that is going to happen  with the porn subreddits.

 You in Missouri by any chance? I'm near the Bootheel and the radar looks horrible.
They got rotation in Obion County Tn right now near me so I guess it might get rough. 




 Get ready to be seriously disturbed by that movie. I read about it and even reading about it is disturbing. 




 Cyclops looks like Racer X. 




 Someone on ebay is selling one for 150 http://www.ebay.com/itm/PlayStation-PS1-Developers-Demo-Disc-CD-Variant-MN-/220741189734 




 The name of that one album escapes me. Too similar to Metallica Black Album.
 




 You grew up to be a male stripper because of that song? 




 Google that disc. I'm serious. 




 I want that disc. EDIT : That's a developer disc. How the fuck you get your hands on that? 
You might have a rare disc worth bucks on your hands. 




 Actually Cannibal Corpse and Deicide is heavier. 




 Opeth is the shit. 




 You did not mention Slayer, Pantera,Anthrax, Megadeth, Testament, Iron Maiden or any good metal.
Slipknot is ok. First album is meh. Iowa is the shit. Vol. 3 is ok.
 




 Was the farm near Jackson,Tn? I heard about a German POW prison that was located around there. 




 Is that Chad Kroger from Nickelback? 









 HEY! BLACKASS! 




 They threat their employees more than Sams Club?
