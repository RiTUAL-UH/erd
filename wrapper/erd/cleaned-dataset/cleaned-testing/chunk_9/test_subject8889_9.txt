 it is actually in human nature to try to rationalize things.  But after a certain point, it becomes self-delusion really

 I just checked your profile /u/beastley325 (not being creepy or anything, I was just curious if this was a throwaway/ if you were new to reddit), and if you ever need someone to anonymously talk to about something when you feel like you have nowhere to turn, feel free to PM me.  I know what that feels like.

Given that background, I'm pretty sure your heart is in the right place.  You will get stronger and stronger, and you can be a great force for good in this world 3 




 You must take it seriously.  You must have an open mind.  You must, above all else, have control of your own mind before you try to mess with anything, so that you can tell if anything is trying to mess with you, and be able to fight back.

The first step to gaining control of your own mind, is to learn to be able to silence it.  To not think.  To think of nothing.  
Go ahead; try to clear your mind.  At first, it'll be difficult, because you'll think of either your breathing or the fact that you're not thinking of anything.  Practice a little each day until you get past that.  

Once you've got that down, you're ready to learn to defend yourself.    This is of utmost importance.  

If you're serious, I will be happy to continue this lesson or whatever you'd call it.  Once you're able to clear your mind. 

edit: and I agree with /u/CelticBull : EVP is at best not reliable, and at worst, may be bull.  Your own senses in your body and mind (the same with which you can sense when someone is behind you, or when something is wrong with a friend or family member) is a much more reliable indicator if you know what to look for 




 That's not a glitch, actually.  Sensing things, particularly with people close to us, is just a natural part of the human experience, the same way you can tell when something is wrong or when someone is upset, or sense that someone is behind you.  Some people are just more sensitive/receptive to these signals than others.

Something new I've noticed lately is that I've been sensing when people go offline on facebook.  I'll randomly click to the tab just in time to see them go offline.  All of the time.   









 I just saw this:  it was like this but not repeatedly : https://33.media.tumblr.com/a9b38183a1fd5d6aa82f0d88daac49c4/tumblr_mfocgyxEPY1rczhxyo1_500.gif 




 thanks; I will definitely bring it up next chance I get 




 no problem!  I just need the courage to say things like that to people in person whom I know need to hear it, without them breaking down in front of me first.  I have no problem saying those things when its clearly wanted, but I'm afraid to say them without the other person bringing it up first, which they don't always do... 




 how were you guys still friends?  that is evil! 




 that was beautiful 3 




 no please share details 




 the only fault you may have is a bad taste in girls, man.  easy come easy go.  easy fix: dont date anyone without being friends with them first. 




 "friend'd dad who" in that last sentence implies that you're the dad.  it should be "friend whose dad" 




 soy sauce 




 they call it "picking up the pieces" for a reason.  You gave them pieces of your heart and they threw you away.  The piece of your heart is not permanently gone.  You are not left heartless.  you have to pick the pieces back up from where they've been abandoned by these people who didn't see their value as a gift.  Those pieces you've left behind are emotional investments.  If you dont collect them back, you'll have nothing left to invest in a new relationship.   you've got to pick those pieces up from where they dropped them and put yourself back together.  Don't leave pieces of your heart dwelling on the past where they aren't appreciated or wanted.  Bring them back with you to the present so that you can heal and be whole.   




 In gym class one time in elementary school I was bouncing a basketball and I bounced it too hard so it came back up and hit me in the face; gave myself a bloody nose 




 my favorite part of this is "box of ducklings" 




 One time, while making the drive up to New York to visit relatives with my family, there was a traffic jam on the highway (as usual), so we were moving pretty slowly.  For whatever reason, there was a line of safety cones in between the lanes.  


The road curved a bit, so we could see ahead, and I saw, in the lane to our right, a rogue traffic cone bouncing around.  Someone must have knocked it down, and it was rolling, lengthwise, down the line, under each car (the rolling under the slowly moving cars must have maintained its motion).  So as we moved forward, it was coming closer to our position (but again, in the lane to our right).  


So directly to our right was a woman driving a minivan.  Due to the curve of the road, we could see the cone coming, but she could not.  So just as we were all inching forward again, the cone sprang up from beneath the car in front of her.  Having been oblivious to its approach, her reaction was priceless.  I wish I had been filming the whole thing but it happened so fast.


I will never forget the look of absolute shock on her face as, to her, the orange traffic one suddenly jumped up in front of her car.  (Thankfully, since we were barely moving, this was a funny incident rather than a tragic one. ) 




 I would have said  "well I don't think I want that" 




 yelling for your mom and her answering clearly broke, or fixed rather, the glitch.  Very interesting though .  It's weird that you did it twice, but was it dark?  I have walked into bedroom doors on a few occasions at night in my parents' house because I really thought I was seeing into the hallway but the door was actually closed and it was just so dark I couldn't tell until my nose hit it.


Granted, you're talking about the morning, but if its early enough, it can be dark too.


that is my best attempt at a logical explanation, but the fact that it happened twice in a row and your hand was behind you is intriguing. 


do you generally turn the light in a room off before or after you step through the doorway?

(In the above example, the light was off to begin with, but) I've been hitting the switch prior to leaving the doorway since many years ago, as I figured the few seconds each time I exit a room, over the course of my lifetime would add up to a substantial energy savings.   The point of that though, is, if you also flip the switch prior to or while passing through a doorway, was the light still on when you were "back" in the room, as if you'd never left, or was the light suddenly off, showing you indeed passed through the doorway? 




 true; I studied psychology in undergrad and I am aware of how that happens.  It could explain the letter changing from rejecting the time off to accepting it (particularly in the context of getting drunk), but it fails imo as an explanation for the medical history, as that is an aspect of her entire life up to that point.

It is easy to misremember details of how exactly something happened, but that generally occurs as more time passes between the event.

to misremember an entire aspect of your life (like, for example, being allergic to peanuts) would be absurd.  




 this is a good idea.  Getting drunk would make it easier to confuse such a thought with reality.  

however, no one remembers the party.  

Op, you may have just got drunk at home, dreamed/imagined all that party stuff, and then decided you don't want to live like like.

But, the letter and medical history changing seriously challenges that logical explanation. 




 Holy shit; I was just thinking you got a second chance up until this point.  I'm not really a believer in jumping dimensions, but damn if you didn't just make me reconsider.

To have all *history* of the problems erased is something else enitrely 




 Wait; I didn't realize there were more besides Berenstain/stein.
It's supposed to be Interview with **A** Vampire, right?! 




 yes, NC; I was about to ask how did you know, thinking maybe it was related to a southern stereotype I was unaware of, but then I realized you must be combining the image of polite antebellum society (ha ha) with the lifestyles of rural communities or something like that? 




 well, I really hope I can help you, because the parent of half of the big problems which lead to me leaving/moving out from my ex fiance, can be traced back to what you just described.  I was going to say it was one of the big problems, but actually, half of them can be connected to it.  You are absolutely right.  She won't be happy. 

you say it takes a long time for you to feel like dealing with it?  well that long time is likely longer than she can stand waiting for you to deal with it.  The result?  she will be the one always trudging through those messes, only to have them reappear far too quickly.  This contributes to (in conjunction with other things of course), feelings of hopelessness; that things are pointless.

you say she is "mess-phobic"; I assume this means her home is organized?  

Do you have a proper place for your clothes?  like a dresser or a closet?  If not, get one.

As far as your habits are concerned, just remember that it won't pile up into an unmanageable mess if you pick up each individual thing when you use it.  Putting a shirt in the hamper when you take it off literally takes two seconds.  Two seconds each day is so easy compared to dealing with the massive mess which ensues otherwise.

Washing one dish after dinner each night is so much quicker, easier, and cleaner than washing a sink full of dirty mess every two weeks.  The latter will get you bugs.

You create these problems for yourself.

You will also feel so much better about yourself, and your house will stay cleaner, if you just pick up after yourself as you go about your day.

your motivation is your girlfriend.  think of it however works for you: do it for her, do it for your relationship, and/or do it to take control of your life.

good luck!

edit: P.S: at least you say you know where your things are.  Pro tip: don't ever wake her up and refuse to let her go back to sleep until she helps you find this thing you need that is buried in your mess somewhere, especially if she has to go to work in the morning and you don't 




 because the word came up in conversation yesterday, as part of the horrifically humorous translation for a name, I was reminded of the likely uncommon circumstances in which I first heard it:

The first time I ever heard or read the C word, I was 19, and I saw it on tumblr.  I don't remember if I googled it, urban dictionaried it, or walked into the next room to ask my (then) fiance what it meant.

But yeah, just thought someone might find it interesting how and how late I first heard that word. 




 well, from my understanding, the million dollar challenge (which it's one of my goals to tackle) is about demonstrating abilities in a controlled environment, not about showing proof of the existence of ghosts. 




 something really wanted you to pay cash for lunch today 




 I like to say that "everyone is a little psychic".

Sensing things is a perfectly normal part of being human; some people are just more receptive to it than others.  What you described is an everyday thing for me and I think it's great.

I don't get bad vibes like that though; I get positive vibes (not necessarily positive as in YAY! GOOD, but as in YES DO THIS), like Go Now, or Go at X time, or Go to X place, or take X way to get there. 




 actually, I'm in graduate school, and that I know of, I've only met one other classmate who reddits.  Even among friends from high school, I haven't heard of any of them redditing.  I haven't asked everyone, mind you, I only asked one person, and someone else volunteered the information in a class discussion, so more of them probably do and I just don't know about it.  Though some definitely don't, as they assume the entire site is full of f'd up trolls...you just have to know which subs to avoid... 




 thank you!  yes that is it.   I googled shockmount and the third result was one specifically made to fit my mic! 




 hi, I have a USB studio condenser mic, and a mic stand which came with no attachment at the top to hold mics (and if it did, it would probably have been designed for a stage mic/ too thin for mine).  


(I have a tiny desk stand that came with the mic, but I would like to record standing up as well without having to hold it.)


I have seen in videos a type of mic holder for the top of a mic stand which I think is exactly what I need.  Here are some images.

I have tried googling it, but I can't seem to find what they are called.  I need to know so I can get one.


Also, would it work with a generic mic stand or does it have to be a specific kind of stand?  (The stand I got didn't even come with a boom, but it doesn't look like I need one for this.  It has a screw top). 

Thanks! 




 sounds like a good idea, since a lot of us music makers can certainly draw, but digital art is a whole other animal 




 thanks! I was about to say the same.  "things out human minds can't conceive" indeed 




 definitely don't actually physicall hear it in my ear, but I play instruments and stuff, so I am familiar with music, so when I listen to music, I don't just listen to it as a whole; I listen to the individual parts and how they fit together.

As a result, when I have a song in my head, I hear it all in my head, complete with each instrument/element coming in when it should and what not.

The purpose of the background info was to demonstrate my explanation for this, which is about encoding.  I think I encode more details of the music by having listened for an appreciated them in the first place, and that results in my being able to play music back in my head as vividly as if I had earbuds in.  So /u/Jelith , it is possible to have the music be "quite as good as the real thing" while it's in your head. 




 I'm glad someone said it, because I was thinking the same thing.  I wouldn't call the difference "childish," but there is a difference.  The voice in my head, while undeniably my voice, sounds different than the voice I hear when I speak.  

However, while I can't explain why we hear the voice in the first place, this difference is one I can explain:

You know how your voice sounds different on the phone and in recordings than it does to your ear when you speak?  (There have been studies about this phenomenon, and apparently, we all hear our own voices clearer and better than they actually are, and what we hear in recordings is what others really hear when we speak.)

Well, although you hear it different, it seems that the brain captures it in its true form.  The voice you hear of yourself in your head is the voice others hear when you speak.  

source: I've heard enough recordings of myself to realize that the voice in my head, although sounding different to me than my speaking voice, really is my voice.

So, per your description, I hate to break it to you, but you must sound "a fair bit more childish and feminine" than you thought. 




 God help me.

I just posted about a glitch which involved not being able to post something to my facebook timeline, and the post itself seems to only exist on my profile but does not show up here in the sub.  I knew it wouldn't be on "hot", but it is supposed to be on recent.  It's not here at all.  But it exists, because it is on my profile and I can click on it.

Here are screencaps showing the post on my profile but not here in the sub http://imgur.com/a/Qmxiq

Here is a link to the post, since you can't find it on the sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/33ykbo/the_universe_does_not_want_me_to_share_this_on_my/

Whatever force of the universe that doesn't want me to post the video doesn't want me to tell about the glitch either.  

Well I'm telling.  I hope you guys can actually see this post. 

If this doesn't work, I will just make more glitchception posts until it gives up.

If there is a logical explanation for any of this please, for the love of reddit, tell me, before I lose my mind.


update: as you can see, I just checked and this post did indeed appear in the sub, immediately: http://imgur.com/YXgchV9   but the original post is still not appearing.  It's clearly not some delay because this post is only 2 minutes old and already on the list, but my post from over half an hour ago is still not there.   




 This just happened and is technically still happening.  
It's not a matter of video sharing in general, just this one in particular.  Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcZFr3lHXh0 feature=youtu.be

It's a Louis CK comedy video.

I was going to post it on my fb timeline (for friends minus acquaintances and a couple specific people, so it shouldn't be like a guardian angel stopping me from making some reputation fuck up or something like that) 

I tried about a dozen times to post it to my timeline (I tried refreshing, typing different captions, closing and re-opening the tab) and each time got this error: http://imgur.com/a/lHQaa  (first image)

I tried sharing it directly from the youtube page (instead of pasting the link in my status, and I got this error: http://imgur.com/a/lHQaa (same link, second image)

Then, I tried sharing it to my like page, just by pasting the link in a status, and it worked!  So I was thinking the problem, whatever it was, was fixed.  Then, I tried to share it from my page to my timeline, and this happened: http://imgur.com/a/lHQaa (same link, third image)  .  Weird letters all over the screen.  You can even see I was telling my friend about this as it happened.

So what the actual fuck?!

As I said to my friend, either God, Facebook, or the universe really didn't want me to post that video to my timeline, but my like page is apparently ok.

The fact that I was able to post it to my like page with no problem means that it's not a technical issue with the video, youtube, or facebook.  

It's completely bizzare. 




 yeah, they're usually after at least a small sum, about three fifty
