 Well, it's out now. Might as well see if it has grown since the last time I measured. 




 There's a hidden bottle of syrup on $10 bills. 




 That's 15 gigbytes more than I thought they had. 




 The date today is Germany flag Brazil flag, 2015. Jeez, do I have to spell everything out for you? 




 How does one sign a prostate? 




 I fucking hate these things. The only thing worse are the Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer decorations. 




 I always thought of bluejays and screaming idiots. This changes everything. 




 M'16. 




 I was pretty excited to see them live, but I was underwhelmed when I arrived. There were so few people in attendance and the band themselves hardly even showed up. It just seemed like they were going through the motions. What was your take on the show? 




 My local liquor store has had one of these things for nearly 30 years, so I thought they were common. Guess not. 




 Thank you for that incredibly detailed answer! That's exactly what I was looking for. 




 Fucking asshole  
  
I agree. Who puts pineapple on pizza anyway? 




 Maybe I can join you in your mother's basement. We can play magic, watch Naruto, and complain about being friendzoned. 




 Nice bow-tie! 




 I remember when it was no big deal to take 30 seconds out of one's life to take a tourist's picture, but that was the 90s-- before all the 20-somethings grew up to be a bunch of self-centred assholes. 




 Gay men of America, I am here to save you. 




 I'm assuming there is a problem with speeders in your community.

So meta. 




 Thanks for the answer! I thought I was never going to get one! 




 That woman was so fucking useless. 




 Thanks, guy. I really appreciate that.

 What happens to all his GBP when he goes to jail? Do they have chicken tendies there? Can he use them to prevent his boyhole from becoming a manhole? 




 It really is impressive. Most people can't do anything with a knowledge of history.

 Someone recently told me about how an alkaline diet can help prevent cancer. I'm far from being a dietician or a scientist, so my understanding of the subject isn't that great; however, I did a cursory Google search and it provided a lot of information to quickly debunk the whole alkaline diet as a means of cancer prevention. Anyway, I guess what I'm looking for is an explanation as to how the body becomes too acidic or alkaline through diet in the first place, and how it corrects the problem. Also, what are the implications, if any, of having an overly acidic or alkaline body. Are there any cases of people having a disorder where the body is unable to correct an imbalance?  
  
Thanks in advance, guys and gals! 




 In case you didn't know, a major part of the gay agenda is to hijack science and... do something with it. I dunno what that is. Probably make it fabulous or something. 




 Yo, dawg, I heard you like tic tacs, so we put tic tacs on your tic tacs so you can enjoy tic tacs while you eat tic tacs. 




 Two words, bitch: Glass ceiling. BAM!

Thank you for pointing out my typo. I'm glad you all had fun deriding my peasant syntax while having a stereotypical reddit circlejerk about punctuation.

 I don't usually speak ill of the dead, but your friend's grandfather had an awful taste in beer. 




 I'm on the east coast (contrary to what you seem to believe, Canada doesn't end at the Ontario-Quebec border). They sell these every spring/summer here. 




 Jesus must have been on the Atkins diet when they took this from his body. 




 Is there a history of heart problems in your family? 




 Atlantic Canada and New England mostly. Please don't go to the bother of seeking one out. They're 15% lobster, 35% disappointment and 50% bun.

 He still acts like a little girl after getting hit. Hockey players play with broken limbs, soccer players cry if they're accidentally bumped into. 




 This kills the cripple. 




 $10 could buy them a new whatever they're living in now. 




 Best way to prep a fat chick for sex is to roll her in flour to find the wet spot. Doesn't work if she just showered and all her crevices are still moist. 




 Two for one! 




 They also use more air, water, food and space. 




 Which do women prefer: bloodpenis or meatpenis? 









 Dey gots it ohl unh cayyyyyymruh. 




 Oh, thank goodness. I'm glad you still have both legs to *prop* you up. 




 Did you lose your right leg, or is that some sort of optical illusion? 




 Came to this sub by accident because I hit the "random" button, saw this post, and was really saddened by your situation. I don't usually give advice, but here goes.
  
Be yourself, OP. Don't try to be someone else by mimicking what you think is "normal" behaviour. Do your best to fit in if that's what you feel will make you happy, but don't feel like you have to put on an act for others for them to like you; you'll never be happy as long as you're acting your way through life. I don't have Asperger's Syndrome, but I know others that do have it, and I never once expected them to "act normal." It's a disability that people should understand and respect. Your family should be giving you the support you need, not acting like there's something wrong with you.  
  
Have you met with a counsellor? If your family have been as unsupportive as your post suggests, perhaps you should find one have have your immediate family members meet with them too.  




 Bonus points for what appears to be a Florida license plate. 




 One time. Well, not actually one whole time. The vehicle crashed through the building before the gif finished, so I'd say it was closer to 0.8 times. 




 The real mystery is who stole OP's caps lock key. 









 How do bears masturbate? 




 I don't hear about it at all, because I don't have cable. 




 Where can you find a replacement flux capacitor? 




 Very nice, but is it bear-proof? 




 I got 11/12! I'm a true goat knower! 




 Put your dick in it and tell us what happens. 




 That poor bike. I would like to volunteer to adopt it if its owner doesn't make it. 




 I'm the guy who donated $20.

 This virus re-emerged in the 1970s, but was known as disco fever at this time. The only casualties were good taste in music. 




 The Charlie Chaplin mustache, then Charlie Chaplin portrayed a character analogous to Adolf Hitler in "The Great Dictator." The movie was not well-received by film critics at the time, so FDR banned the Charlie Chaplin mustache nation wide. The rest is mustache history. 




 The Simpsons is the funniest animated sitcom on TV. 




 No, but my girlfriend would. 




 Here, have an upgoat. 




 My girlfriend's cats are throw up constantly, and when they do they make a bee line for the nearest rug. Why can't they just throw up on the tile or hardwood floor? It's like they're saying, "Fuck you, human, we know how hard it is to get cat vomit out of your rugs."

 I was very much expecting that. You could see the pike stalking the ducklings from the very beginning of the gif.

 Well... is he? 




 Pretty sure that's how they punish adulterers in the Middle East too.

 BAD  
  
Yes, sir, that is definitely the only way to describe how your car looks. 




 Chill, maybe. [However...](http://freeassembly.net/rapporteurpressnews/statement-oman/) 




 Thank god someone is keeping those neckbeards under control. 




 You people are fucking weird. 




 I hope no one was arrested for trying to exercise their right to peaceful assembly. 




 Or you could put beer in it. 




 They usually do that for free when you get your alternator re-torqued.  




 Before I answer this, I have to ask why you want to know.

 My catalytic converter needs rotating, you say? Well, go right ahead and spare no expense. You're the car fixer man after all! 




 Nice painting, dad! 




 I'll think twice now before agreeing to take pictures of tourists. 




 You are the freakiest of all freaky chicks. That or you're great at making up stories. 




 It's only gone if we forget it. 




 Most redditors are, so don't feel bad. 




 That is VERY disgusting, actually. 




 Hashtag confirms it. Mr. OP, take down this post! 




 It's at 19 right now... should I mess with that? Yes. Yes, I should. Fuck your OCD. HAHAHAHAHAHA!!! 




 And Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. As per the usual, fuck the maritime provinces. It's okay, though, we don't matter. 




 Danktrocious indeed. Dank on, brother. Dank on. 




 Sick mods, bro. 




 Yeah, I doubt I'll ever leave. I never took part in any of the subreddits that have been banned, and the ones I would like to see banned are still alive and well. It's out of my power, so why bother caring... right? 




 Road trip! 




 Shit crop, bro. 




 Fat people are disgusting and I hate them. There, I said it. 









 So, there haven't been "ongoing issues with harassment" on /r/coontown. How does a hateful subreddit like that get to exist? Why doesn't reddit's anti-harrassment policy extend to hate speech? That is something that isn't explained in any of those links. 




 Reddit sucks now and everyone has left. Fuck this place. 









 Keep that neckbeard chilled. 




 Fucking horseshit you're not rich, asshole. 




 Only 3 million redditors fall under the 18-29, English speaking American demographic. I can assure you, that is probably the only group of people posting shit like that. 




 I think you're giving redditors way too much credit. And yes, I am "understanding how many people there actually are."  
  
You sound like someone whose comment might end up being posted on this subreddit. 




 It's scary to think that when I was a kid I trusted adults to know what was best for me. Now that I'm older, I don't trust them to know anything. 




 I did it, reddit! 




 Where are these neckbeards getting their IQ scores from? Seriously, though, there's no way so many people on reddit are scoring 150 and higher. Something like 0.1% of the population has an IQ higher than 145, so I'm disinclined to believe anyone that tells me they have a "higher than average IQ." It's usually the least intelligent or most narcissistic who believe they're smarter than everyone else. 




 Don't be a NIMBY. 




 Everyone knows self-memes are the dankest memes of all.
