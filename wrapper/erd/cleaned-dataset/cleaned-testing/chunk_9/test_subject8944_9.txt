 I agree that if he can achieve the name recognition she has that Sanders will win. I just do not agree that he will end up anywhere close to Clinton, even if he had a full year. 




 How is it not useful? If Bernie does not ever achieve close to what Clinton has in name recognition then he won't win. 




 For the life of me I could not understand why the police just told the guy they suspected him of a crime. That would have forced him to identify himself. Also they did meet the burden for arresting him. They had testimony that a woman reported him of stalking her, a crime. They just knew he didn't do it and didn't want to go through the paperwork. 




 I always wonder who the white kid is in that video. Is he getting picked on by the black kid? Is he just chillin? He plays it cool as a cucumber. 




 The link you refer to compares Obama to different Republican candidates. In your link, if you go down to the Democratic Candidates heading and click that link, and sort to a Broad Race, you will find that Obama was polling about 20-25% in June 2007.

The percentages you refer to Sanders polling in are open Democratic primary races. The above link I referenced is the closest comparison.

While I agree it is highly unlikely Sanders will win, your comparison was not referencing the same type of polling for Obama in June 2007 and Sanders in June 2015.

 Not yet ;) 




 After I posted my comment, I saw your comment below regarding the Cruz case where different is not necessarily worse. I guess that within the context of the article, the connotation was that you meant worse, even if that is not what you meant. 




 The potential client. 




 I don't see that as nitpicking at all. I love Slack's writing but that was sloppy. Don't make an absolute statement if you were not intending it to cover all instances. 




 JUST. LIKE. THAT. 




 If it would depend, please give me a scenario  where you would advise a client to sign a document that they would not treat as legally enforceable. 




 He went undefeated for 10 years. He fought for many different orgs and in many non-title fights so title defenses is not as impressive as it could be. But his strength of competition was still respectable. He fought many fights against fighters ranked in the top 10 at the time of the fight. 




 I'm in law school. I work in a law office and write enforceable contracts ever day. 




 Of course it is. Would you sign a contract that you may be able to use unconscionability as a defense for? What if your defense to the contract is denied? 




 Of course, but it's better to treat everything you sign as if it is legally enforceable.  




 Do not believe it if they say that! Whatever you sign is legally enforceable. Your best bet is to go over the contract with a labor attorney. 




 While you are correct, you never want to give the police information that could be used against you.

If it were me, I would give a short, one sentence statement on my 911 call or after police arrive, explaining that the person attacked me first, and then shut up until I had a lawyer. 




 If it were me, I would say on the 911 call that I shot/stabbed whomever in self defense because they were attacking me. When the police get there, say you to refer to your 911 call and shut up until you have a lawyer. 

I say this as a law student who has been working with and been around many lawyers. 




 Burden of proof is on the state. Yea they can take you to jail, but police can take anyone to jail for any reason.

Edit: If it were me, I would say on the 911 call that I shot/stabbed whomever in self defense because they were attacking me. When the police get there, say you to refer to your 911 call and shut up until you have a lawyer.

 This is not a legal issue. I am not familiar with Australian law, but there is almost no likelihood that they are required to rent out to someone under 18.

This leaves you with only the option of finding someone you know there to let you stay with them, or find a company that will let you rent from them at 17 (highly unlikely).

Another possibility is catching a flight there the day of the game, attending the game, and flying home immediately after. 




 "I'm taking my talents to the Rust Belt!" 




 Don't know about German but I took Danish. Teacher is super easy and chill. Only 2 semesters until your requirement is met. Super small class (mine was 12 students). I went in with no previous experience and it was easy. 




 The attacker would not be liable. 




 Oh I totally picture the people of Arkansas interpreting it as "Imagine how horrible the world would be without religion [Christianity]." 




 Where was Depp? 




 Well I'm saying that Kennedy is decidedly on the side of same-sex rights. Thus, he is not the swing vote. It's possible that even in a 5-4 decision there is no swing vote. 




 Then you're calling every justice in the majority the swing vote, in any 5-4 decision. 




 Kennedy literally wrote the Windsor opinion. He has been in several decisions that have upheld same-sex rights. It is highly doubtful he will be the swing vote in the current same-sex case.

As for the Obamacare subsidies, he was in the dissent in the last case, with CJ Roberts being the deciding vote. That one is a crap shoot on the final decision. 




 I live in San Diego!! 




 That seems... unlikely. It would be highly unethical of them. I'm not saying you're lying, but do you have a source? 




 Why? 




 This guy was trying to plant the idea in OP's head that homeless dude gave him the dog. 




  Older fans started whispering that this felt like 4th and 26.

As someone who watched that live, I remember felling like crap for 3 weeks afterwards and had a similar feeling after the Seahawks game. I'm 26. Am I old? 




 It's ok. I'm in law school making terrible financial decisions as my current self. :(( 




 I see. I went to a state school where tuition was only $4,000 per semester. I bet that makes a big difference. 




 My experience was the opposite. The vast majority of people I knew paid their own way with grants, loans, scholarships, and jobs. 




 Again, many parents refuse to cosign. Mine did not do that either. 




 The trick with fines is you have to control for how many times the person is caught. So if $50 would prevent me from throwing a cigarette on the ground, but I'm only caught 1/50 times, I might find it worth $1 to litter each time. But at $2500, it's worth $50 for each offense. 




 No, but most parents don't pay for their kid's college. My parents didn't pay a cent of tuition or living costs. 




 Stop paying fees for grandma.

Stop paying brother rent unless it's cheaper than a storage facility.

Stop giving uncle money unless it's cheaper than living elsewhere.

Get a job, anything- even minimum wage to keep her busy and give her income.

Invest all, but a 3-6 month emergency fund in an index fund. 




 He did say in one comment that he has a felony on his record. 




 I don't know if this is how other schools grade, but mine does points. I got exactly 255 points, equating to a B+, both semesters. Afterwards, I just thought about the odds of that happening.

Unfortunately, that went from my worst class first semester to my second best class second semester. :( 




 As someone who has filed several FAFSA's, that is definitely not true. You put down whatever income you want, and if they audit you, which is very rarely, then you have to provide verification via your latest tax return. However, it would be very dumb to write a higher number on FAFSA than you actually make, so it is very likely she makes AT LEAST that amount. 




 You're being downvoted, but as a law student currently working at a firm where a company is doing exactly that, you are likely right that this is at least part of the reason. Zuffa has very deep pockets and can bury the fighters in motion after motion until they run out of money.

As a result, these lawyers who were likely hired locally by the fighters, now have to travel to Nevada for every hearing. That can get expensive. 




 Law student who just finished Civil Procedure. This is correct. You cannot appeal unless it is a final judgment, with very few exceptions that it doesn't look like fit here. However, they would be able to appeal this after the entire case finishes, but it is highly unlikely it would be overturned. 




 I see it from that perspective. I guess it just depends on the dynamic of their relationship. For me, I know my SO would never say she would be going to the corner store and not answer her phone for so long. We also live in a bit of a rough neighborhood so that plays into effect for me. 




 I'd love to hear your breakdown after any high profile fights if you want to keep posting here! Glad to have you, Scott! 




 It might have something to do with being a new user. 




 For me, the corner store is about a 2 minute walk away. I would report my SO missing if they took an hour. 




 It will expire, but the extension will be able to pass 3 days after its expiration. We will be right back where we are now. But hey, I guess we'll get 3 days without the govt reading our stuff. 




 I hate when WEC titles aren't counted. For Aldo, this is his 10th defense including WEC. 




 A 5 year old is not equivalent age as a 14 year old. 




 He means the person who lost the bracelet, the police, or anyone besides the legal clinic. Who did you admit to that you took the bracelet? Did someone see you take it? 




 I'm only a law student but perhaps someone could weigh in on the possibility of suing your school in small claims court. You would not need an attorney for this and the fee is rather cheap. You could bring your friend whose door was also left unlocked and any other proof you had. I believe this would be your best option. 




 What is the context of this? Jonah just doesn't wanna be on camera? 




 Went to see it with my girlfriend last night. I cheered when Clay came on screen. A bunch of girls in the theater cheered as well. My girlfriend informed me it was because they tore his shirt sleeves off to show off his muscles. I just thought there were a lot of Packer fans :( 




 In addition to recording the screams and giving them to the police, you should attend your next city council meeting and bring the issue to light. See if you need to sign up to be a speaker and explain the situation. The more neighbors who will come with you, the better. If it were me, I would suggest to the city council that maybe a motion-activated flood light could be installed, facing away from the houses, but I'm not sure if that is practical. Further, making sure these two are prosecuted each time they break the law and suffer a higher punishment each time could be a suggestion, but that would only help if the possible punishment includes jail time. For the break ins, you could look into having a security camera point at your driveway. 




 You are literally crazy. 




 Even in civil courts, the general rule is to require unanimity. The difference is the burden of proof, from "beyond reasonable doubt" in the criminal system to a "preponderance of evidence" which basically means 50%+1. 




 I don't see a legal issue here. She can proceed however she wants to. 




 If they have a waiting list for your type of apartment (ex. 2 bed 1 bath), you will almost certainly not be responsible for the extra month if you tell them you are moving out on such and such date. You could find this out by having a friend call and describe your type of apartment and ask if there's any openings. Note: you may still be responsible for some incidental charges 









 I don't know how many MMA fans I'll find in here but this guy looks EXACTLY like an old-man Nick Diaz. 




 Sounds like the Scott Elder commercials I heard inAustin all the time. 




 They actually said in one of the reports that they found documents in the car that said JONATHAN JONES. Just... Lol.. 




 Dude probably has crazy high insurance limits to protect his massive net worth. I'm sure his insurance will settle for below his limits. 




 My god... I'm not sure I would have been able to leave the table. That's just insane. 




 Yes but not a ton. It won't get you into a school unless you were right on the edge and the others didn't have the work experience.

An admissions officer once told me that LSAT is 50% of an application, GPA is 49%, and everything else put together is 1%. I find that to be pretty accurate. 




 A good LSAT score is essential for you. You don't have a great GPA but you don't have a crap one. One point about the LSAT is to give yourself time to take it at least 2 times, if not 3. Since you're taking a year off that means your last one should be December 2016, 2nd to last October 2016, and first one June 2016. You have plenty of time to learn so you should begin reading some of the Bibles and maybe take an LSAT class.

Also for your gap year, try to find a job that is law related. It can only help your application and give you a perspective on if you want to be doing that for the next 40 years of your life. 




 As much cap space as he's eating up, I agree. I think anything up to 1/3 of our cap space would be a good value for him. I mean he's (arguably) the best player in the league at the most important position. 




 Rodgers is the highest paid player in the league at $22M per year? So much for TT's value contracts... 




 Exactly. People get picky here, sorry.

 As a 17 year old, who won't be at the same school his girlfriend until after the first year of college, I can say with 99.99% accuracy that it won't last the rest of your lives. And there's nothing wrong with that. Everyone has young relationships where they are head over heels for each other and think life is just the best ever. But people grow up and change. As much as you may not want to hear it, you will change a LOT over the next 2, 4, 10 years.

My advice would be to enjoy the time you have with her. Be happy, let her be happy and just go with life. This is one of the last times in your life where you have next to no responsibility, so just go with the flow.

Your college plans sound like one of you is a year older and have plans to join the other at college after the first year. Is that right? If so, I can almost guarantee the relationship won't last. I'm not trying to sound mean. It's just long distance is hard. And even if by some miracle you were in the same city, it would ruin the first year of college where you should be making all sorts of friends and getting into schenanigans and going to your first parties while living on your own.

Assuming you're the one leaving for college and she's a year behind, I would say you should enjoy the time you have, but when you're about to leave just let her down gently. Be nice and tell her there's a whole world out there and if she still wants to pursue a relationship in another year when you're both a little older and have more life experience, you'd be glad to try.

Best of luck, man. 




 Well how common is your name? Closer to Joe Smith or Fencile Whooperpuff? 




 Former Realtor here.

This is standard practice, at least in my area. He will get paid a finders fee by the apartment complex you rent from. 




 Just like OJ... 




 Pure conjecture, but maybe growing up with the Internet? I'm 26 and the Internet just started to get big around middle school for me. So I was all over it to learn and research during my developmental years. 35 year olds were mostly out of high school by the time the Internet started to get big. 




 You should start applying for other nanny jobs immediately. Look for jobs that include live-in if you need it. Otherwise they should pay enough, if they're full time, where you can afford your own place (even if with a roommate).

Your safety and mental well-being are most important. Be vigilant at all times when you are at the house, especially if the wife is out. 




 He certainly did. At 23, Holloway is starting to show some serious game. Punches were on point, subs were on point. I'd like to see him become a little more comfortable with wrestling and clinch but he's coming into his own.

I just worry about them throwing him to the top too fast. With Aldo/McG coming up, Holloway likely only has one more fight before a title shot. But he should take at least another year or so to continue improving. 




 Dillashaw-esque was his performance, Joe. 




 This whole thing about "family" is crap. Would you not report any child molester to the police?

If I were you, the absolute next thing I would do after reading this comment is to immediately call the police. You can call 24/7. You can call the non-emergency line.

These girls lives are likely to be severely impacted because of this. You were who they confided in so YOU have a responsibility. Your uncle doesn't want the cops called on his dad? Tough crap dude. Maybe he shouldn't have molested children. If someone in your family murdered someone, would you not call the cops?

Come on man, get your head in the game. 




 Fun Fact: Holloway fought four times last year and is already fighting for the second time this year and it's only mid-April. If he ends up with four fights in 2015, I believe he'd have the record for most fights in a 2 year period (8, tied with Cerrone (twice)). 




 He's starting to say "two of us" but gets cut off after the t so it looks like "t-" which looks the same as +- because the handwriting isn't perfect. 




 Gracias. 




 HOW DO YOU HAVE TIME TO BE HERE? 




 It still hurts... 




 Why would you wipe off with a towel??? 




 Why wouldn't you just go up to your room??? 




 I agree it helps, but it's still not bullet-proof. 




 Ok, so you get them charged with that. But if caught, they still may report it to their insurance and you could easily be found responsible for the damages. 




 I am just a 1L, but where did I go wrong?

More of a Civil Procedure issue than Evidence? Same end result and since he wasn't asking for nuances of law, I figured I answered it enough. 




 Yea, rules of evidence. But you could wait until they formally file the lawsuit and then give their lawyer the dashcam footage in discovery. 




 On the flip side, if anyone ever does this and you DON'T have a dashcam, just gesture towards your windshield and say you do. Maybe they'll freak out and leave. You'll still be stuck with your damage, but that's better than the other guy's as well, b/c 99/100 they would rule you responsible in this situation. 




 Even better: "You're welcome" 




 Jehovah Witness if I remember correctly. 




 Where do you see that? In the article they only mentioned getting rid of the personal exemption. 




 I'm not arguing that at all,only that anyone that now has a personal exemption can simply claim s religious exemption. 




 I left out the sub to punches. That's more of a tko. 




 Still allows religious exemption. Biiiiig loophole. 




 Under current election theory with our current electoral standards, that is exactly what you should do if you want to minimize the risk of a Republican winning. 




 But that's what I'm saying, it won't get better under your scenario.

Let me put it this way: you're saying "swim across the ocean, you'll hit land eventually" and I'm saying "you're not going into the ocean, you're heading for outer space so you'll never hit Earth again." 




 Well then 4(b) applies.

But my point is that by posting this or telling others you'll vote 3rd party, you are possibly convincing others, who are convincing others, etc. So by then, if you go "oh now it's a swing state so I'll vote Hillary" then it doesn't matter at that point.

You doubt New Jersey will EVER be a swing state? Texas was blue not that long ago. NJ was red 27 years ago.
