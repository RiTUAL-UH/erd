 All my fucking friends are getting fucking cars and I'm still riding the fucking city bus 




 I'm Haitian. 

It is absolutely true that Haitians will ruin your garage sale. I have seen multiple occasions of Haitian people coming to a garage sale with a box, collecting $50+ worth of stuff in it then setting it in front of you and saying "5 dollars?" And if you say no, they just leave everything there. I think it's fucking hilarious that people do that but yeah it's annoying if you're the one having the garage sale.  




 Now I'm looking at a whole 25% instead of 20% thank the lawd
