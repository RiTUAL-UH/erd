 I agree with this claim, from personal experience. I could not go to my top school I wanted to due to cost. The school I wanted to go to was higher ranked and had tougher admission standards than the school I am attending now. Yes I was still able to go a university, but the cost was why I chose a university with lower admission standards and a lower academic rating. 









 also, I think they are more put off by the term socialist.
