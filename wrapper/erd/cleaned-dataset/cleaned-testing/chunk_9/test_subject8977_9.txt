 He's not that much of a failure. I mean he defied the laws of nature when he united the hair on the left and right side of his head. Who's to say he couldn't do the same for the American political system? 




 This isn't really fair, especially with someone who has to deal with these guys 24/7.... 




 That's the face I made when o read the meme 




 These have been around for a while as a way to reduce the bottleneck caused by people waiting in line. Also, more orders in the kitchen = more cooks needed to pump them out.
 




 GUYS IS JERRY FROM FUCK JERRY 














 Thanks for doing this guys! 

I've been a huge fan ever since I MISSED your show at Coachella two years ago. I've already purchased my ticket for your show in La this June, do you guys have anything special planned for your show? 




 Are you kidding me? What makes you for a second think that you don't need an education? Going BACK to school is the first step in solving your problems.  




 Gimley, is that you? 




 Nothing like a fine piece of rock hitting your face at 100mph. It's the finer things in life... 




 We have a new earth, a blank slate, another chance to do things right with all of our current accumulated knowledge. 

What technology would you implement. What political structures would you encourage.

What religions would you allow/disallow?  

What would you change/continue doing on this new blank slate of a planet?
 









 I can never unhear this 




 What if you had the same dream????? 




 Those are my thoughts exactly. I think the context of the setting was enough to really empower the guy to speak up. 

No idiot would confront someone calling them a faggot in the middle of an empty street. That I understand.  




 I don't buy that. If you're inside of a restaurant you have a reasonable expectation to be safe. Granted, if someone on the street called me a faggot I'd just mind my own damn business and not start a fight.

I think proof of the pejorative is the only thing holding the police back from calling this a hate crime. Though, the video's pretty damning if you ask me. 




 Fuck this guy so hard. We need to find him and put his ass in Jail. 




 Now you're just spreading misinformation, that I"ll argue with.

[What is a hate crime?](http://geneq.berkeley.edu/what_is_a_hate_crime)

The following activities are examples of crimes that qualify as hate crimes if motivated by the victims actual or perceived group identity:

**Physically assaulting someone while using derogatory racial, sexual, etc. words**
 




 It's kind of easy to derive that sort of thinking when you respond to an objective and rational post with. "stop being so emotional."

But I'd rather not argue.
