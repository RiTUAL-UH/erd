 Yes. One of many great reasons not to hand out guns in fucking vending machines. Scan that brain. I bet a two minute convo with that POS would've let any mental health pro know that he was unfit to carry.  




 See, this is the type of thing that a full mental health screening could suss out before handing a little fuckstick like this a weapon.  




 Imagine if he'd had to do it with a knife. Never would've carried it out.  



















 Look, they're force-feeding him money anally while he says it.  









 It looks like it's just the top half of the baby. Half a baby.

State Senator Vincent Sheheen (D-Kershaw) gets emtional as he sits next to the draped desk of state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, Thursday, June 18, 2015, at the Statehouse in Columbia, S.C. Pinckney was one of those killed, Wednesday night in a shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston 









 Or how social security and revenue actually function in our country. Would love to see this discussion among mature Americans.  




 Exactly. Funny how they paste that Libertarian badge on and round up so many gullible folks who think it's better than your standard GOP corporate shill. Same Old Fucking Shit.  




 Precisely. It's the opposite of what countries with wonderful living standards have done.  




 Right? Except it has! The Pauls have no business in politics.  




 Exactly. This is why this is a completely asinine, billionaire-masturbating idea . 




 Rand Paul is a disaster. His small-minded ideas don't fit our country. His misogynist and racist attitudes are regressive. As a progressive female parent I am appalled he is respected by people in my generation. I get the naiive 18 year old paul worship, but not so much the 30- and 40-something; seems people are absolutely ignorant to world affairs, real economics and social issues. That little bubble must be nice. Where is it again, somewhere in Phoenix in your parents' basement?  









 Agreed. This is what killed Farrah Fawcett and it was an abysmal death. Horrific cancer, get well tommy.  









 Another photo shared on Facebook Thursday purports to show Roof, 21, sitting on the hood of his car with his legs straddling a license plate for the "Confederate States of America." 














 His klandaddy.  




 Would be nice to see that law changed. If someone has any charges, let's not arm them. It never ends well.  




 The only people questioning why it's a hate crime were on reddit last night. Probably his brothers in bleach.  




 How much does the FBI / NSA monitor the extremist white supremacy cancer in the US? For all the monitoring they do of muslim groups, funding of terrorists abroad, this type is statistically much more dangerous on a daily basis in the US. Would love to know that they're raiding a fuckload of klan groups today.  




 Interesting balcony / foliage. Where in the world is Carmen Sunbathingdiego?  




 Not at all. There is a massive racial tension in the US right now and a shitload of libertarian klansmen with huge arsenals. But that might be speculation, I'll wait to see who the guy actually turns out to be.  









 He was a democrat, advocated for strong social programs.  




 Nine. 




 For a minute I thought today was Juneteenth. 

[Juneteenth is the oldest known celebration commemorating the ending of slavery in the United States.  Dating back to 1865, it was on June 19th that the Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, landed at Galveston, Texas with news that the war had ended and that the enslaved were now free. Note that this was two and a half years after President Lincolns Emancipation Proclamation - which had become official January 1, 1863. The Emancipation Proclamation had little impact on the Texans due to the minimal number of Union troops to enforce the new Executive Order. However, with the surrender of General Lee in April of 1865, and the arrival of General Grangers regiment, the forces were finally strong enough to influence and overcome the resistance.](http://www.juneteenth.com/history.htm) 




 So apparently everyone is here because of the new live thread feature on Reddit's main page. Here is the link to the main reddit thread about it. http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3a8k4r/breaking_active_shooting_downtown_charleston/ 




 Several people were killed in a shooting at an historic African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. 

Police said the suspect in the shooting is a clean-shaven white man in his 20s, with a slender build. He was wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans and boots. 














 Yes. 

[He was active in the civil rights movement: Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent, says "the average person is working longer hours, lower wages, and they do not see any political party standing up and fighting for their rights."

Sen. Bernie Sanders On How Democrats Lost White Voters
Sanders was an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and participated in the historic March on Washington in 1963 as a 22-year-old student at the University of Chicago. "It was a question for me of just basic justice  the fact that it was not acceptable in America at that point that you had large numbers of African-Americans who couldn't vote, who couldn't eat in a restaurant, whose kids were going to segregated schools, who couldn't get hotel accommodations living in segregated housing," he told the Burlington Free Press. "That was clearly a major American injustice and something that had to be dealt with."](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/29/399818581/5-things-you-should-know-about-bernie-sanders).

 The suspected shooter is still at large, according to the Charleston Police Department's Twitter. Police described the suspect as a white male, approximately 21 years old, with a slender build. They also indicated he is believed to be wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans and Timberland boots. 









 Hmm.  














 Rumsfuck

 Skull n' Bones Corporate Edition 









 We can't even train all PEOPLE to do that.  




 IDK. Your theory makes sense, but on the other hand crows are very fucking smart. Would not be surprised either way.  



















 What a hero! Someone's daughter is clearly simple collateral in the land of the metal penis. Na 




 Absolutely absurd. Charge those in power with the murder of each victim that results from this arms lobby delusion.  



















 Wonder Woman pokes smot.  




 Next time someone asks if I wanna spoon, I will wonder - snuggling or crack? 




 Guess that quadriplegic just needs to roll on to the next gig waiting for him eh? The guy was using MMJ because he has no limbs. Not just smoking to get baked, which btw should also be none of the employer's business. This country, I fucking swear.  




 This is a quadriplegic using medicinal marijuana, not someone getting stoned and showing up for work.  




 Privatization is BAD FOR PEOPLE. This is true with utilities, healthcare, school...the things we need should be public. The things we WANT can be private or public.  




 I did the same thing. I remember riding my bike lazily around the neighborhoods around my home telling myself stories I'd make up. It was some of the best time of my childhood; no deadlines, no parents around, no younger siblings around...I am ready to leave America. Shootings and busybodies are killing childhood.  









 A HE HE HE HE HE HE 









 I read it that way too but thought he meant she had some incontinence. Wondered why 2015 mattered.  




 EeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO screeeeech!!!! 




 That's how the cannabis dispensaries are. But it's not their fault; it's our banking system / federal laws being fucking dinosaurs.  




 This is a great point.  




 Precisely. Prescott Bush funded them; Dubbya resurrected them.  




 "Most" of us do not have great healthcare. Most of the people you know probably do.  




 Fox news is a terrorist organization. Doing the harm they've done and spreading so much misinformation that their viewers are LESS INFORMED than those who don't even watch the news...they need to be shamed, fined, and shut down.  




 Yep. Nobody stepped up when Obama DID voice support for single payer, and now they hate the ACA. How can people be so. fucking. stupid.  




 This is a perfect depiction of the united states under the GOP threat. Class warfare, abysmal treatment of those who do the fucking work. I'm past the point for having pity for the stupid fucks who vote GOP. Now I consider them part of the threat.  




 Yep. It's my fucking empty bag you just told me to put there, slower cousin of Siri. :P 




 IDK if it's because I worked at a printshop so I know basic maintenance, but my two home printers are not at all a pain. VERY low maintenance. I have an epson 13" wide R2000 and an HP letter size scan/print combo.  




 Toothaches.

Menstrual Cramps.

Awful economy.  




 That was main***line***. Kurt always wanted to main***line***.  




 Would you be surprised if the other half was real? Curious how you're so certain.  




 But the pot thing hasn't been "fixed" by legalizing it. The states that did legalize are being sued by other states, and still dealing with MASSIVE issues because of the federal ban. It still needs to be fixed at the fed level to be legit.

And your PS makes me think you're high right now.  




 You know who infringes on the rights of citizens? Corporations. All the fucking time. They push the line so far and when they go over it? A fine that equals less than 1/20 of the CEO's bonus.  




 Exactly. We have a bunch of charter protection agencies and they are failing all students.  




 Colorado Berner here, sending a small amount every month for a year. It's what I can do.  




 No kidding. With all the slash and burn of their pensions, abysmal treatment of teachers, etc - would be a fine time to step up.  




 That's fucking huge. YAY 




 Aw, leave it. Almost feels psychedelic in reply to this video.

They never do. They downvote and ridicule just like their ammosexual cousin-brides.  




 An hour?? That is crazy shit.  




 Nebraska makes me nervous that they'll profile us, since they're suing us.  




 Or took an extra one. You know because he was seriously really explaining everything with a lot of words and it almost felt like it was typed really fucking fast on his computer while his fingers got warmer and warmer and his eyes began to buzz while typing out his incredibly precise if lengthy question.  




 I haven't been but I am way more paranoid about it post-legalization than I ever was for the 2 decades when pot was illegal. Definitely think that CO plates are profiled. I was actually told by the cashier at  Target (discussing going on a drive out of state) that I should be prepared, they pull over Colorado cars at the border. She was talking about going north out of CO. I thought it was a weird convo to have with an older woman cashier at Target, but hey.  




 You're downvoted but you are absolutely right. And how the fuck did these two halfwits get firearms? Oh yeah, from the NRA vending machine next to the condom machine.  




 Meanwhile there is no media about where the guy, previously arrested for domestic violence and threatening to go on a shooting spree and kill his whole family, got his guns. 




 Careful! Axl will hunt you down. 











Then he'll BBQ you.  




 Or more salad eating.
