 Does the Recobbled Edition of The Thief and the Cobbler count?  



















 Yeah, that's a better word. Thank you.  









 I need music for a short film and was curious about your opinions on this. While there are some excellent scores like the one for Psycho or Suspiria, they never really make me scared because the music is so good that it becomes thrilling instead of creepy. To me the most effective music I ever heard in a horror movie was the score for Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which is really ugly and uncomfortable: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3odOfyPz8L8

Would you recommend going more for music that's easier to listen to or going more the discordant and creepy route?  


 




 People laughed at this? 




 Had. It went downhill when he fell through the floor in that Halloween store.  




 No. Call it "This is Not a Spockumentary."  




 All the actors featured on the poster will be representing Everest as a human pyramid.  









 I can't tell if they're angsty or just bored.  









 The last thing I wanted on any JRE podcast I ever listened to was for Brian Redban to talk more.  




 *sniff* The miracle of life. So beautiful.  




 Asylum is going to make a knockoff series based on The Illiad.  




 Expect it to come out in August, 2021 then.  




 You could shift them out of the scene where they hang out at Hawkeye's.  




 Looks like he's going to hit Ellie instead.  




 /r/fearme 




 I'm amazed they're bothering with this movie since it was a bomb and certainly doesn't have much of a cult.  




 I would rather he just report these things like Walter Cronkite than force in a reference to whatever's trending on Twitter again.  









 119 minutes you'd use whining about some other experience.  




 I don't think that one got much critical praise. Critics I read all basically called it "okay."  




 Or just shot the whole thing in first person POV-style.  




 To specific movie that had a wonky stunt like that or to cheapjack movies in general?  




  "a lot of FA men do bring a lot to society"

Speak for yourself. 




 Four. All awkward and two led to the person I asked resenting my presence. Oh well.  




 Hooray, grounds for a new "shared universe theory!"  




 Was King admired by officials in the U.S.S.R. or were his non-violent protests considered a threat? Was he actually actively courted by their agents or representatives? I know King was suspected of being a communist (in part because he had socialists in his social circle) so did any foreign powers reinforce these beliefs intentionally or otherwise? 

Thank you for your time.  




 Who would think this is WTF? It's pretty clear what's going on and it's not too hard to imagine the appeal.  




 WE DO NOT HOLD THE BEACH! REPEAT, WE DO NOT HOLD THE BEACH! 




 Wouldn't it be boring if he were just one thing all the time?  




 Hi-de-li-ho, your majesto! 




 That happened at a screening I went to as well.  




 She looks a bit downtrodden.  




 Has anyone seen the Affleck one? What's it like?  




 I know it's purely cosmetic and that my real problems are confidence and finances, but damn if I'm not finally beginning to lose some weight and get a little definition. And of course exercise is usually good for depression.

Anyway, thanks to all the people who were pulling for me weeks ago on this. It's a bench press in the right direction at least.  









 Sorry, I meant buttes. Applejack wants to go back to the desert for awhile.  




 How did villainy manage to make her even cuter?  









 Cool effect, but the face seems a little goofy to me.  




 I meant is it literally true to life. Metaphors can communicate a point without reflecting what literally happens, such as the Grasshopper and the Ant. 
 









 Deadly Premonition's first murder victim being crucified up in a tree while kids giggled at the base had me hooked.   




 You know, an older Alex DeLarge deciding that he's bored with going around inflicting the old ultraviolence and that he's going to go live a normal life. 

I always thought that was kind of fucked up in how nihilistic it was. That it's supposed to be alright that even though DeLarge was a murderer/rapist, it's fine now because he's stopped and all his victims should just let it go/be ignored. But anyway...

Isn't that kind of inconsistent with how human beings really act? Don't psychopaths not just bored with what they're doing in real life? Isn't it much more likely that DeLarge is just going to keep raping people than that he'll just stop committing crimes?  




 And then you explode.  




 Oh man, imagine how many people must have asked Ali to pose for a photo like that and thought they were the first to think of it.  




 Is this that infection where bacteria that usually exist in one part of your body get into another and kill you really quickly?  









 Personally, when I get some cash for a bit of freelance/spec stuff I do online, I get the impression that I feel as good as I used to back when I socialized in High school. Money makes me feel so validated, even though loving it is supposed to be the root of all evil. At least I'm not acquiring it dishonestly or using it in ways that hurt anyone. 

You?  




 I think there's a documentary somewhere out there where Willis admits he thinks he went a little too dark on Godfather 2. The word "light" was in the title.  









 Too busy laughing to be creeped out.  




 Why restrict yourself to Youtube videos for masturbation?  




 Does it matter that your SO is apparently undead?  




 I have no idea why this is still around. It sounds so stupid. 

"I can't attract anyone who grew up in an environment similar to mine, so I'm going to pay for someone from an impoverished region to come over and hopefully feel obligated to tolerate me until they can save up enough money of their own to leave me." 

The power dynamic involved, the resentment I'd imagine she'd likely feel at least subconsciously, etc. Being forever alone sounds much more enjoyable than that.  




 Is that the notoriously racist one, or did Batman drop that at the end of WWII?  









 Brings to mind that 99 Problems video.  




 Good, half the stories in these books were so dumb that even in elementary school I rolled my eyes at them. Especially the one where the guy doesn't notice the woman who's basket he's carrying doesn't have a head or the toe/liver stories.  




 Looks exactly like something from that Closer NIN video.  




 "effort" 

Heh heh heh 




 Please don't.  




 Nothing about twice a week, but here's a source that says to limit the red meat: http://www.cancer.org/cancer/colonandrectumcancer/moreinformation/five-myths-about-colorectal-cancer 




 So, she was going recite a passage from The Vagina Monologues?  




 A Million Ways to Die in the West. Even most moviegoers don't like it because Seth McFarlane's character is such an arrogant putz and the script has two gorgeous women being attracted to him, but I still loved it.  




 Because attacking Shadman's drawing skills is supposed to sound smarter than "I don't like boobs drawn like that!"  














 Probably Rainbow Dash. Since she's got an ego, it's the most amusing when she gets embarrassed and has to do things like draw a watch on.  




 Why would they bother with a woman with an artificial eye? They very clearly cut away to a completely different face.  




 I never came close to laughing at any of the .mov videos.  




 Not like that airheaded wildman Spock we're all familiar with.  




 To be fair, they're using magic to fly, meaning you need to switch to mathemagics (which are base 666.)

 I watched a Crow in a movie theater on TV for years, so this isn't really a big deal for me.  




 He's in Tree of Life, which is so dense and pretty I could watch it over and over.  




 Wait, why are there different addresses at the top and bottom?  




 For future reference, this would probably do way better on Reddit if you took the write up and put the text in the descriptions of the relevant images, otherwise you have to go back and forth to get what's being referred to.  









 So, what STDs have you caught?  




 This is more like a public service announcement warning against it.  




 I was watching this cartoon about this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DpbVXof5Sk and I wondered why hasn't this become a real underground thing if nothing else. It's apparently becoming a thing that psychiatrists are recommending too: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychiatrists-embrace-deep-brain-stimulation/ 

It seems like it would be legal, probably cheaper for the rich and more reliable than cocaine, etc.  














 Poor woman became a furry in death.  




 Still looks like a Benny Hill scene.  




 Well, now those unicorns are out of work.  




 http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-female-cosplayers.php

I tried to keep it objectively about the quality of the costumes and the photos and keep any sex appeal out of it. I guess you could arge a lot of the appeal for the photos has more to do with post-production than with the model, but still I've also found there's only so much you can photoshop a dud performer.  




 Once they reach the temple it's all downhill except one scene with the skull.  




 Too weird to live: Too rare to die.  




 /r/motherearthporn 




 Holy shit, I am the 75%!  




 ... I'm not.  




 Fluttershy looks a little chubby from this angle.  




 Please help me locate the creepy thing in this gif. 

 




 Is that last one from Legion?  




 Not really, kind of plateaued at about two seconds in.  




 Example? I haven't read the book, so I wouldn't know.  




 I need a break from all the space operas, dystopias, thrillers, horror, etc. I am on the look out for something upbeat about the effect future tech will have on our relationships and the like.  









 Because people on Reddit are way less willing to click on links to non-Imgur posts.  









 Twily's too fussy to eat more than one kernel at a time.  




 I HAVE ALL THE CUTENESS! COMPARE YOUR FACE TO MINE AND THEN KILL YOURSELF!  









 Anus, anus.

 Va-va-voom! 



















 Oblivion fucked it by being dull and seeming like a similar movie that preceded it.  














 This is adorable! 




 Guy could be a psycho, though. There's a story in one of the documentaries about Citizen Kane where he threw a fit where he went around a hotel kicking down a bunch of doors.  









 Then I guess I'll just have to sit in this nice vibrating armchair instead... 




 Time to C D this suggestive content.  




 Mandatory: Taste the rainbow.  




 Stewart was in some ridiculous crap, such as North   South.  




 Pretty often because I never bought an iphone or anything so I never got in the habit of constantly checking.  




 No! You're treating the symptom, not the disease! 




 Can he swing, from a web? 
No he can't, he's a mouse. 

Look out!

He is a spider mouse! 




 But don't talk about it.  




 I hope this doesn't seem shallow, but I mean purely in terms of how good the animation quality is, not how funny they are or whatever. So far I've got: 

-Double Rainboom
-Snowdrop
-Cheer Up, Fluttershy
-Children of the Night

Or there any others that come to mind?   




 That's just straight up /r/oldschoolcool. 









 http://listverse.com/2015/03/24/10-inspiring-stories-of-lifesaving-civilian-heroes/

Admittedly many of these people were heroic in overwhelmingly horrible circumstances that some might feel eclipse their heroism, but personally I think that also makes their courage more inspiring.  




 You mean the video is one very long shot or they got it in one take?  




 Richard Linklater's Slacker. It's not super happy and inspiring, but it's a pleasant movie for the most part and oddly relaxing.  




 Way less trippy than some images from the movie: http://i2.listal.com/image/1223189/600full.jpg 




 It kinda looks like the wolf is Samurai Jack's enemy.  




 Jason Segel? Well, there goes the Lego Movie winning streak.  














 That's a recycled still from when he auditioned to be part of the House of the Undying.  




 Our little girl's tragedy is way sadder than yours! 




 I have a kind of risky project in mind that will either be creepy or a laugh riot, so I was curious how y'all would feel about that if it happened to you.  




 Huh, you'd think a performance popular enough to get both would have been able to get Best Actor.  




 Yes, I want to rip off Michael Evans's idea of making a short film based on a highly-rated short Reddit story.  




 To save anyone curious a Google search, it was for Best Supporting Actor in 1944 for *Going My Way*. 









 Watching Jupiter Ascending, I was thinking about how wonderful it all looked, but that the movie's insistence on a fairly generic adventure story kept getting in the way of fully enjoying it. I wondered what movies out there would best allow for just immersing yourself in it, and it seemed to me that it would probably be character pieces and/other eye candy comedies. Are there any like that which come to mind? 

I know there are options like Blade Runner and Dark City, but I was hoping for a break from the more dour stuff.  




 There I was, in a roll, gong to the gym every other day and starting to get in shape (kind of) and if nothing else, stave off my worries I'd get diabetes. Then I got severely sick (like "buckets of yellow phlegm coughed up" sick) which threw off my sleep cycle so I've been having trouble feeling well enough to hit the gym. It's like my health saw that I was making progress on self-improvement and decided I needed to be tripped up. Like the extremely shitty chickenskin, the terrible teeth, and greasy hair weren't enough ways for my body to keep me unattractive.  




 I don't know how I managed it, but when I went to see Gone Girl last year, I knew literally nothing about it except that David Fincher had directed it which I believe massively enhanced the experience for me. I still don't really know what some upcoming new movies are about, but I've heard excellent general things about them so I'm looking forward to being able to go into them blind as well. 

This goes completely against my old habits where I would get excited for movies and read several reviews of them, and in hindsight the process would diminish the movies a bit when I saw them in. 
 




 Bet you he goes Hangover 2 on this one and just redoes the exact same movie.  




 "Go tell Alexander I'm not giving him the orb!"  




 Is there a word for having a phobia of reflections being off in some way? /r/creepy seems to have a really bad case of it.  




 I like how he looks like Hitler as a kid.  




 Why would the building burning down bankrupt the company? I'd imagine they have insurance. 




 I forgot to swap the music in a student film out for the music from the Youtube library until after it got hit by the third party content match, and now it's saying monetization isn't currently available. How long should I expect to wait for that? Should I just delete the current posting and reupload a new copy with library music?  




 I tried to get into one of those Vietcong tunnels and could barely get down to my knees in.  




 I told you to kick yourself in the dick! *Draws gun 




 I still like Under the Skin, although everyone's criticisms of it seem completely fair too.  




 Robbed at the Oscars!
