 [Here is an article I wrote about good apps I use](http://thesga.org/2013/07/ten-essential-mobile-apps-for-the-archaeologist/) 




 They have it at Disneyworld too in Hollywood Studios. 




 I think anthropology is a wonderful discipline, but I got into the field knowing it was not a moneymaker and jobs were hard to come by. However, I do know a couple single moms who are badass archaeologists. 

Anthropology is very complimentary with many other fields, including business and sales, because of how it teaches people to better understand other people. Perhaps you could minor in Anthro and use it to complement something else that you would enjoy if you are worried about employability. 

If all else fails, many states and cities in the US have archaeology societies that welcome avocational (people without degrees) and professional archaeologists alike. These groups have regular meetings and presentations and often organize volunteer excavations. Perhaps finding a group like this in your area can even help you with your decision. If you're in the southeast, PM me for some leads on these groups. 

Best of luck! It's a hard road, but if you know what you are getting into it can be a rewarding journey. 




 I would probably "kill them with kindness," by being really nice about it but thinking vindictive things to myself about how much money they are spending and how much extra calories I don't have to worry about. :x 




 Hey you Pikachu? 




 How do you get flaired? I'm new here. 




 Yes they do! :) 




 We mainly get 4th graders here, and yes most of them are adorable. :) Also thank you! 




 People don't fit into neatly defined boxes on a census form, no matter how much sociologists wish they would. 




 People are people.

I am a museum educator at a Mississippian site in the US, and children ask me all the time things like "Why are they dressed like that?" I usually turn it around and ask them, "Well why did you choose that shirt today?" And then their little brains go "oooooh," and we get one step closer to cultural empathy.  




 I called 10 days prior and then asked again when we checked in. All we wanted was a King size bed and they made it happen. 




 We were at WDW celebrating our anniversary last week and I wore my anniversary pin everywhere. One of the castmembers at the Fiesta de Jardin booth at the Flower and Garden festival was commenting how the 1st anniversary should be extra special and gave us an extra flan. I think it helped that we were talking in spanish! :) I loved having everyone wish us a happy anniversary. :) 




 I came. o_o 




 Why thank you :) 




 I'm not sure what that means, but I can say they were goooooood! 




 The weekends haven't gotten started yet so Darth's Mall wasn't open for us. :( They start the character meals on May 4th. 




 Thanks and you're welcome! It's a great pin. :D 




 Haaaaaah that's awesome! 




 Definitely! 




 I was kinda sad they didn't have that going last week, but it looks really great! Have fun! 




 That's awesome! I'm super grateful to your cousin then! 




 It was a really intricate costume! His helmet scanner even flipped down. No voice, but somehow that made them even more menacing. 




 We had an awesome time!! The character interaction was wonderful (I have to say though I think it depends on how into it the guest is- you gotta give them something to work with people!), the food was AMAZING, and the atmosphere was spectacular (Sci Fi Dine-In).

We arrived for our 8:25 reservation with a few minutes to spare, checked in, and mingled with other guests while we waited to join the rebellion. Once your rebel cell is called, you join the line to meet [Darth Vader and Boba Fett](http://i.imgur.com/1mcxNdb.jpg). As you can guess from my outfit, I was not too popular with them! Fett liked my boyfriends' shirt though of course. Boba scanned me with his helmet eyepiece and tried to collect my bounty. He was also not impressed by my ears! Darth Vader went as far as taking my Chewbacca plushie, holding it up for the crowd to see, then turning back towards me and slowly and deliberate wringing his neck before dropping him on the floor while staring directly at me. Evil!

After you get your picture taken, the cast member hands each person a mini Lightsaber that can go either red or blue depending on which side you are on. At the table, (which are little cars from the 50's) you get your menu and the server goes to get your pastry starter. A pastry tray, fruit, beverage, and entree are all included in one price. The [pastry tray](http://i.imgur.com/wBRwqgi.jpg) had chocolate muffins, puff pastry Lightsaber sticks with red or blue sugar, Darth Vader Danish things and Princess Leia sticky buns. All delicious!
The fruit salad or parfait that you get next has a little melon Yoda on the top. The entrees all have cute Star Wars names, but the only one that looks special are the [Vader waffles](http://i.imgur.com/QG1TZyu.jpg) which were amazingly delicious! I washed everything down with a blue milk (kinda blue raspberry flavored). The cast member who checked us in at our hotel mentioned we could keep ordering as many entrees as we wanted, but we found that one entree was plenty of food.

The screen at Sci Fi was playing Star Wars clips the entire time and whenever the cantina band music came on, the jawas and Stormtroopers all danced. [I traded with the Jawas](http://i.imgur.com/3VKH1zS.jpg] (they swindled me!), convinced the [Storm Troopers](http://i.imgur.com/yAGUrPJ.jpg) we were not the diners they were looking for, and [apologized to Greedo](http://i.imgur.com/qBpxvVp.jpg) for the incident in Mos Eisley so he would take a picture with me. When we left, Boba Fett almost followed me out the door to make sure I left. All in all, it was an amazing experience that I am so glad we were able to do. 




 Lol thank you :) I had a lot of comments on my ears (which came from etsy) so lots of people liked them! 




 I traded a rubber Darth Vader keychain and got a pink usb cable in return. My boyfriend said mostly what he saw in the trade bag was candy. 




 It really was! Have a nice time. 




 That's right, it only goes partway through June.

 Thanks! That's too bad :( 




 Wow it really does O.O 




 Good luck bud. :( 




 Thank you :3 




 I know right? Great value! 




 A USB cable would, but not the AC adapter. 




 Haha yes I did! I've been looting for about a year now. :3 Thanks! 




 Glad to help!  




 I love having the shoulder strap. I think the case looks great too. I might have to get some patches or something to brighten it up some. I just like color! 




 I would think so. That case looks really similar to the one I have on mine in the photos attached to my review. 




 [Here's my review, thank you!](http://www.amazon.com/review/R1948J6WYDGGS0/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm) 




 Hey if you remember [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/3474zi/10_free_new_3ds_xl_cases_in_exchange_for_honest/) post from a few days ago about the case, you might be interested in my review of the product [here](http://www.amazon.com/review/R1948J6WYDGGS0/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm)

I really recommend the case! :D 




 Oh snap there will be OVER 9000 pokemon to finish the dex! 




 Yes that is the face tracker. 




 /u/Trollabot test_subject9096 




 I have a TN screen one. It doesn't bother me. Mine is black and I got it about five weeks ago. 




 I think so too. IDK why neckbeards insist on downvoting. XD 




 Gimmefreestuffers are everywhere on the internet. 




 [This case perhaps? Looks nice OP!](http://www.amazon.com/TakeCase-Carrying-Accessories-Protect-Nintendo-Guarantee/dp/B00UG63VDG/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8) 




 Pokemon black looks like crap blown up so I play it on the smaller resolution. 




 I always turn off my nn3dsxl before I insert or remove a game card. Do you not have to do this anymore? :O 




 It has a C-Stick, yes. 




 My New 3ds XL has a TN top screen. 




 As stated above I used metallic temporary tattoos I found on Amazon and sealed it with base coat nail polish. 




 I know right? I realize of course that it's fairly harmless but that doesn't mean I can't feel a lil creepy. 




 Yeah I should do that. 




 Yeah I never considered the possibility and my Mii is pretty recognizable.
