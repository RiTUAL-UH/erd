 There was also a passing play where the refs would call pass interference every single time if you passed to a certain reciever.  It would give you 25-30 yards every time. 




 Over the past 2 years I've lost just under 40 pounds with just exercising and not changing my diet.  I'd say I've been averaging about 25-30 miles per week running and 45 minutes of weights 3-4 days a week.  Of course changing up my diet would have sped up the weight loss process, but I didn't want to have to change up my eating and drinking habits in order to lose the weight.  So it is possible to lose weight without eating less, but it will take longer to get to your goals. 




 How does Jr advance instead of Logano?  Logano beat him 2 out of the 3 events. 




 Maybe you're at the wrong track. 




 Is he even sitting on a bench or just hovering in a squat position? 




 Maybe you're thinking of 2006?  He missed the Chase, but won 3 of the races out of the 10. 




 Dilbert, don't end your sentence with a preposition. 




 Whoa, the 21st century!  I wonder what other advances in technology there will be? 




 I don't think you need a tab open.  Most people will start one while they are there of course though. 




 I was at Darlington and the June Michigan race this year.  Darlington had maybe around 15 tents there and Michigan had several rows to go through.  The Saturday morning at Michigan I spent about 3 hours going through those things, and easily could have taken longer. 




 As I run past another person that looks similar to someone I know, I usually think of an imaginary conversation with that actual friend for the next few minutes. 




 Jayski posts the old non chase points each week. After last week he actually would have been up to 10th. So possibly even higher after his 6th place finish today. 




 Before DVR's were the normal thing I called my roomate who was upstairs to ask him to come downstairs and set the VCR to record a show on later that evening. 




 Other 2 should be Talladega in fall of 2000 and Pocono in June 2012. 




 And it looks like you have a window in your office.  Why shouldn't you.  You've been here 10 minutes. 




 I don't think Titanic was initially released in China.  Which is why it made so much money over there with the re release. 




 Especially with all the different flavors available now. 




 I prefer to buy all of my movies on blu ray or dvd.  Depending on how much I like/want to see the film is what I base If I want to get it right away or wait until the price drops a bit.  I just need to have a physical copy for some reason. 




 Carpet? 




 His?? 




 Hopefully this means one of two things.  Some kick ass games are on the way.  Or their next system will actually compete with Sony and Microsoft! 




 I would almost think quite a few people would still be standing just from the start of the race.  If so you wouldn't even notice any differnece for people sitting/standing for these 2 laps. 




 Clerks 2. Hands down! 




 Titanic.  Except the iceberg sinks instead of the boat. 




 I'd be fine with the next day or two.  So that could work. 




 I'm going to be moving to a new place in the next week and won't have FXX any longer.  Is there any good place online to be able to watch the current episodes of Wilfred? 




 Looks like the N64 even comes with a game. 




 Jimmie got second last today and last week. Has that ever happened before? 




 Why does he have to put so much emphasis on the H? 




 Ha, wow.  I guess I should use all the digits in a number next time I try to correct someone. 




 Or it's actually 147,198 cubic feet 




 Or you could try watching the first episode of King of the Hill to get my joke. 




 Ford stand for Fix It Again Tony 




 He should get one of his daughters racing in NASCAR.  That'd give Danica a run for her money! 




 But then Kyle Busch will have to miss the Chase on purpose just so he can keep winning in the lower series? 




 I believe Hamlin is signed through 2015. 




 But when you look at the fact of what their ages were when they each started, the comparisons aren't that different in wins.  Jeff Gordon took 8 years to get up to those 55 wins and Jimmie did it in 10 years.  Just think if Jimmie had been around when he was also in his early 20's! 




 Good question.  I would also like to know about this. 




 I wasn't aware of what they did until I read about it. 




 Regular Wii remote you can press B under the controller for the power slide.  So you would keep holding that instead of RZ when you let off the gas. 




 Got 149 for the month.  One of my better amounts over that amount of time. 




 I'm probably gonna hear it about this one, but I'd say Dale Jr. 




 For the interval running that I do, I usually use a treadmill so I know I'm staying at the higher speeds when doing them.  But as HDRgument says too, he/she prefers to do workouts outside to be in the environment they normally run in.  So I could see that being beneficial too if you are able to keep the pace you want. 




 Cast Away 




 Thanks for the explanations of the different types.  I'll have to test some of this out over the next few weeks and see how each of them go. 




 I've been running for several years and around last October I initially began increasing my speed for short periods during one run a week.  This turned into a sort of interval run for me where I alternate between 1/2 mile at slow pace and 1/4 mile at the sprinting pace and then the final sprint I push myself for .4 miles.  Over time I've been increasing the speeds, and I can definitely tell it's helping.  My natural pace went from about 7.1 mph to 8.0 over the past 6 months.  

Recently I started wondering if trying out a different system of interval running would be beneficial, or if it would essentially be as effective as what I'm currently doing.  I was thinking of possibly a pyramid interval in order to try to get longer distances in during my sprinting portions.  I don't really have a specific goal that I'm working to attain.  Aside from natural buildup for better speed and endurance.  Just wondering if there would be any benefit by changing things up a little bit. 




 Sounds like my co worker that I share an office with.  She plays music through Grooveshark on the computer and has a playlist with about 12 songs on it.  Been playing them over and over for the past 4 weeks now.  She must not realize there are other songs available on the site. 




 I believe you're right.  I thought the off from Bruton was only for one year. 




 Ahh, that would make sense.  For some reason mail in votes didn't even come to my mind. 




 I'm curious how the votes used to be accounted for before it was done electronically.  Or was it decided in a completely different way?  Also, how was Bill Elliott able to win so many of them?  I know most fans didn't mind him, but I wouldn't think he would be able to be considered the most popular for so long. 




 Redditors of Reddit:  What is the worst Askreddit question you can come up with? 




 I would say it's a good starting point to go from.  I started running more regularly about 1 1/2 years ago and started around 4 miles initially and increased about 10% per week.  Once you do enough weeks you'll be able to gauge if you are able to add more or if you should stick with what you are doing. 




 Not me, but my friends dad has been going at least a mile every day since Jan. 1, 2000.  I think that's damn impressive! 




 No idea.  His wikipedia page says he hasn't raced in a major competition since 2009. 




 Yup. Good job! I only know about it because my brother is a Hamlin fan and I use this stat to make fun of him 




 131 




 Nope 




 What driver made his only Sprint Cup start at Pocono and finished higher than Denny Hamlin in the race? 




 Last week I set out to run all 7 days and get 50 miles in and was able to accomplish it.  Usually I would run about 4 days a week and get between 25-30 miles in.  Made me feel good from accomplishing it! 




 Got third in a 5K just over a month ago.  Didn't think I would be anywhere near the front of the pack before the event.  Made me feel pretty good. 




 It's like a kick stand! 




 I was in Charlotte 2 years ago and it was a good time.  If you do plan on going to speed streets, I'd say do the other stuff first, then use that for your night time entertainment.  Also plenty of bars in the downtown area too. 




 I thought bananas were the standard unit of measure? 




 The reason why race wins in NASCAR aren't really comparable to wins in other sports is because in other sports you only have 2 teams competing heads up.  So you have 1 team getting a win and 1 team getting a loss.  In NASCAR you have all 43 teams competing in the same event at the same time.  So to use a win loss record in NASCAR you would actually have 42 teams getting a loss on their record each week regardless if they finished 2nd or 42nd.  To sort of relate it to your comment here about playing it safe, you could technically say if a driver finishes 7th they lost to 6 teams, but won against 36 others. 




 So doing it in Hawaii lets you get really close to the fish? 




 For that damn safe to be opened up! 




 Thanks,  
I never knw that either!
