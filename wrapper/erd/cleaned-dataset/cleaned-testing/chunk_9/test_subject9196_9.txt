 What is most easy and good argument for and against http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis  




 I think this is called pull requests. 




 I see there only Python, PHP, Node.js so no easy way to use on Android (unless this framework is only for backend solutions). 




 What for? This is a library, app that is "visible" and can be used is just a mock to show how it uses library. Also it won't be possible as Android M isn't still release as API (for example 23) thus also I cannot upload it to jitpack etc. 

Which is a good thing because there can be still some changes before it going public (and I hope so, this library removes only some of pains to use new Permission model). 




 Is this some clone of a http://jimulabs.com/ (Mirror tool) even gif looks like theirs. 



















 Go ahead and give a try to Import.io.

Created two production apps based on it. So far very good experience. 




 To be honest I would suggest traveling to Warsaw/Gdask/Krakw at any occasion that you would have - as Biaystok isn't that much to see. Unless you want to enjoy nature - then mazury is your best bet and it is not that far (great for kayaks/yachts). 









  Which App Store?

 I would suggest subscribing to AndroidWeekly, browsing /r/androiddev also G+ Android related people etc. and use Pocket to save articles to read at work (on a phone/tablet).

You will soon find out many interestings patterns, ways of solving problems, hacks and cool features. 




 I would guess Leopold FC660M but keys and case (probably) has custom color. 




 Every account on reddit is a bot except you. 




 Thanks, but that sounds good until you have a paid app. 




 I just read this post [Android is finally beating Apple in this one key metric- revenue from apps ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/341k7h/android_is_finally_beating_apple_in_this_one_key/) and as almost half app revenue is from "China market" though it would be good to read about it and maybe try to sell there some apps.


Did you use any Asia markets (competing with Google Play) to sell your apps ? If yes, which ones and what is your opinion? 









 Go and look for local developers meetups (my personal recommendation - GDG events), most of them have hackathons - events during which teams compete by making apps. In most cases you can join them as a idea person, and see if anybody is up to join your idea and help to create it.
Source: I'm local GDG organizer and I love hackathons. 




 Nice post, I would also add accelerometer data to check if user isn't looking down. 




 APK direct link:

 Best libraries are those that solves problems that you didn't know that you have. 




 I would like to see library effect on for example gif in readme instead of having to compile project or download APK. Much appreciated.  









 Oh, ok now I watched GIF few times more I got this. It is both drawer and wizard. Before that I thought it is wizard with drawer as a part of wizard process. Thanks! 




 I'm not sure if Drawer is correct UX pattern in "wizard", as (in most cases) we don't want user to jump from first to last item without setting middle ones.

Just a thought. 




 Anybody tried it, how are results?  




 His name is Robert Paulson 




 It always bothers me (like now during SpaceX Falcon 9 start) why they start to count last 10 minutes and show all those people doing a lot of important work in command center on dozens of screens.
Also is there some kind of manual that they go through - can somebody explain it what are some most important moments? 




 22 here: Computer Study Engineer, worked last 10 months in nice and (mostly locally) well known company but got the feeling that it is the last moment that I can achieve "better" things (risk a bit as I don't have a loan or something). Thus now I just want to push some idea with crowd funding support - so in year or two I can be proud of something that I created. 




 Thanks since posting I used my SO laptop (Lenovo flex 14) to see how does it look as it has even more dim screen - looks like it will be fine in 95% of cases which is good enough for me. 




 Thanks for suggestion but T450s is no match for me - need HDMI output as I'm doing quite a bit of presentation using projectors. 




 Hi,
I'm on the edge of going with X1C but only turn down is poor screen brightness mentioned in few reviews.

Can somebody confirm if all panels (HD/QHD/QHD with touch) have similar brightness?

I aiming in HD version but maybe it is worth to pay for better screen this 400$ more.
