 I used to order the medium boneless wings....and eat most of them....that's about 15 wings at 80-100 calories a piece depending on sauce.....I knew it wasn't great, but didn't realize how bad it was... 




 What exactly are naked tenders? 




 I haven't been to Bdubs since I started 1200 calorie lifestyle.  When I used to go there, the amount of food I ate was ridiculous.  Any suggestions for menu items that are tasty and won't completely throw off my day? 




 Thanks!  




 I'm currently working as a cashier and to calculate my TDEE use sedentary.  I'm starting a new job in a bakery pretty soon though,  should I switch to lightly active to account for the extra calories burned while working?   




 I like lambics! I'll keep an eye out for it. 




 It sounds good! Do you have any specific recommendations?  




 I am 24F 5'5" SW: 165 pounds CW: 148. 150 was my first goal, because that's what puts me at a normal weight.  It was only 15 pounds,  but being able to say I am no longer overweight is such an amazing feeling! 


I've been tracking everything on MFP and have been eating 1200-1300 calories a day. Took me 77 days to get to where I am now. And I'm hoping to continue to my next goal of 135 pounds. 


Reading everyone's posts on here has been a huge help and inspiration. 




 I'll plan it out either right before bed or first thing in the morning. I've been learning to leave about 200 spare calories just in case I need an extra snack at some point, or when dinner comes and I want to put extra cheese or sauce on my food. If I still have that 200 calories before bed, I'll have a beer :)  




 They make little 80 calorie packs of Nutella. They are meant to be used on the go, but I like them because when I measure out a tablespoon,  I can't accidentally put a big round tablespoon of Nutella on my plate.  




 I'm trying to eat about 1200 to 1300 calories as well,  and have found that /r/1200isplenty has helped.

 Just received an email, the 7 for 27 is now. You can buy online or in stores I believe :) 




 I'm 5'5 and currently 151. We got this! :)  




 You don't want them soaking forever,  but these were fresh and crisp and seemed to hold up well.  




 Romaine hearts :) 




 You're welcome! Good luck :) 




 I'll have to look for them next time I go to the next town over. My tiny town has one grocery store and they don't have them.  




 I'm glad you still enjoy it sometimes :) 




 Romaine lettuce, don't try iceberg lettuce. When you buy romaine a head of it isn't round, it's long and narrow and each "boat" is a leaf. I'd post a picture but I'm on mobile and don't know how to post a pic in comments. Google romaine lettuce and look at pics if my rambling doesn't make sense :) 




 Bison meat is so good! 

It's buffalo meat. 




 We used ground beef prime rib burger, cooked it, added onion, and mixed in some canned enchilada sauce. And seasoned it with whatever my SO threw in there, he is the spice man. 

I mixed corn, black beans, and canned tomato  green chilis together and heated them up.  This was meant to be just a side dish, but I threw some on top of my meat as well, and mixed a little bit of shredded Mexican cheese on top. 

Calories came to 509. We aim to keep dinner between 500 and 600. Without the shell it would have been 444. And the meat we used wasn't lean, so probably could have shaved a bit more calories off if we picked a different meat. But I was still under calories for the day so I was happy with the meal :) 

Edit: Numbers. ... 




 I'm a baker....I used to eat fresh baked bread for lunch, by itself. I've cut back, but I'll never be able to ditch bread completely.   




 I love shells and bread and all the calorie dense carbs. I do enjoy a good taco salad, but I can't abandon my shells completely.  I ate all the lettuce boats first and saved the shell for last.  




 Enjoy!
