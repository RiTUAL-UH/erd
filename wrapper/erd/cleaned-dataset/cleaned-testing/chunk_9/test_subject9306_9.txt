 I think you need more pictures, and they need to be bigger. Hard to see much from just that. 




 I thought pic 3 was BY FAR your best - IMHO ditch the beard and never bring it back, and keep your hair short. Other than that, you're doing well man. 




 I opened the second picture and literally said "oh fuck off, he's way too good looking for this sub." Keep up with the weight loss and maybe try a more mature haircut, and you'll be beating them off with a stick. 




 love_scene_girls is right - with different glasses and a different haircut, you'd be amazed at the difference and the improvement. best of luck bro.

P.S. do you get told you look like Martin Freeman? 




 Honestly dude... you've got skills. I wish I could flip a situation like that and create so much attraction. Once you get past this, you're going to be one hell of a PUA.

 




 Thanks man. 




 1) look for positives in everything that you do. The more you practice finding something good about something, the easier it will be. Get on a bus? Appreciate the air conditioning. Go into a shop? Compliment the service.

2) When you are with another person, be it friend, date or otherwise, think about things about them that you like. If something strikes you, just tell them. Straight up. All you have to do is smile and be honest.

3) Once this comes easily to you, you can start putting some more thought into what people *want* to be told. What are they like? What do they want from their life? If they're a driven career person, for example, tell them you admire their drive and dedication. In a similar vein, there's a great quote that goes "tell smart girls they are pretty, and pretty girls they are smart." 




 Thanks for the resources man, I'm really appreciating this other side of the PUA community that I hadn't seen before. The more I read about it, the more it helps with the rest of the stuff on /r/seduction, like filtering through TRP and 'alpha' stuff to only take in advice that I want to use. 




 Excellent point. If it works, it works. There can obviously be pleasure in the art of pickup for the sake of itself - developing newer, more subtle strategies for the fun of doing so - but if you're not into that and you have something that works, who cares? 




 I've tried getting into pickup several times, and I'm currently on my fourth attempt. What always killed it for me before is what seemed to be the cunning and manipulative aspect - get as many girls as possible to have sex with you, never tell them they're pretty because it's so beta, never listen when a girl tells you about a problem and needs emotional support because it's so AFC. I hated it, and I consciously decided every single time that I'd rather be lonely, single, and still a kind and loving person than a manipulative, selfish prick who has no time for people who won't give him sex or social proof to get sex from other people.

This post is an amazing breath of fresh air. It's exactly what I needed to hear, thank you. 




 sources or videos than can teach me this? I'm incredibly interested. 




 Dude, she's blowing up your phone. She clearly wants you. What are you worried about?

 I'm attractive

 I work out

She's probably texting her friends right now saying "this really attractive guy messaged me online and even asked me on a date, what am I going to do? He probably messaged five girls as attractive as I am, how can I show him I'm better?"

Stop thinking about whether you deserve her and think about whether she deserves you. 'Leagues' are only determined by the people who end up out of them. Enjoy your date, have fun, see what happens.

P.S. many of the most ridiculously attractive girls are actually quite lonely, because everyone is too intimidated to approach them. You may be one of the few who has even shown interest in her and that's why she's blowing up your phone. So to reiterate, she wants you just as much as you want her. Best case scenario. 




 Tell smart girls that they are pretty, and pretty girls that they are smart. 




 You're out on a date, it's going fine, you're getting IOIs etc, and you kiss her to show your interest (rather than tell her, as I've been informed). Then maybe you kiss her again. 

What do you then do in the immediate seconds after kissing her? Continue with whatever activity the date was? Go somewhere else? Say something? Assuming the time is not right to invite her back to your place.  




 You've got a point, and I respect that. But at the end of the day, the whole Pascal's Wager thing isn't even why I'm there. It's to be a better person and hang out with a great group of people.

There are people who say that atheist organisations are capable of following similar morals to the bible (etc, blah blah blah) and having the same effect, and as I've said, I don't know a single atheist who is as good a person as a GOOD christian. That, also, is besides the point - I think it's a bit like gym routines, where everyone has one that works well for them and doesn't necessarily work well for others. This one works for me. What more can I ask for? 




 It doesn't work like that.  




 Now it's a huge part in her.  




 If you don't like small talk, then don't do it. 

Steer the conversation towards something more meaningful and with more substance. This comment is hardly the place to explain that full process but there's plenty on /r/seduction about it - but basically, get them talking about something they are passionate about and that you can have an interesting dialogue about where you both learn something. Politics and religion are probably not the best topics for obvious reasons, but once you've gotten through the basics of a meeting (who are you, what do you do etc) you should be able to either find something you have in common which you can discuss, or if you have nothing in common, ask them to explain a topic for you. For example: "so you're a biochemist? I honestly know nothing about biochemistry, can you explain what makes it so interesting to you?" People love to talk about what they are interested in, and it's the best way to a) make them feel like they've had a great conversation and b) learn something new for yourself.  




 I find this dodgy. No field report, no conversation starters for pairs of people, no evidence at all other than "it's easier than one person." 




 Nope, ballet dancer. 




 Even the bandies have their jocks and their nerds. I was a nerd bandie for years, I felt like I was on the same social level as an amoeba. 




 Doing it with a big grin helps a lot. Also, be 100% confident right through the activity. If you falter or think "I'm being annoying," somehow, that's when it is annoying. But if you just keep going like it's a hilarious joke then it is for them as well. 




 Thinking of "pushing your belly button in" for vocal support is a terrible idea. I'm a professional singer, and I've personally suffered from using that mentality - it causes vastly too much airflow below the vocal folds and can cause you severe vocal damage in the long run. It also doesn't help you increase your volume because you are still basically shouting, and it reduces the amount of oxygen that is used by your lungs.

I can''t teach you how to breathe properly here, because that's a serious job for a face-to-face professional. But you *must* not focus on consciously contracting your abdominal muscles (or pulling in your belly button) - you are tensing the rectus abdominus muscles rather than the transverse abdominus groups, which is exactly the opposite of what needs to happen, as the rectus abdominus must stay as loose as possible in order for support to function at all. Your body will use the transverse groups to support speech automatically (this is how any air is moved over the vocal folds at all) and consciously thinking about it is the best way to interrupt this process.

There are plenty of exercises and resources on the internet that can aid you in this, but there is also a lot of bullshit. You want to look for Accent Method Breathing for singers, which is over the top for an everyday speaker, but exactly the right thing for everybody to be doing to some extent. 




 Have you seen a speech pathologist? I'm a professional singer and, believe me, it's so easy to think you're doing the right thing with your breathing and your vocal technique when you're really, really not.

Books and youtube videos can't help you, nor can online courses. Only getting real help from someone face to face who can listen to your sound and give you feedback will be of any benefit. It is of enormous benefit. Depending on what country you live in, this may also be covered by your health insurance.

edit: I've just read the above comment on "pulling your belly button in" - this is a horrible idea and will make your 'shouting' *much* worse rather than any better. Please don't do this. 




 Depending on who writes the love letter or how, it's really the same thing.  




 This definitely, overwhelmingly goes for men as well.  




 Squealing like a Japanese schoolgirl is not recommended.  




 Most of the ones I know still can't do it.  




 Side effects may include jail time 




 Sorry, /r/relationships needs that space 




 This may be just my own personal experience, but the only people I've ever encountered who believe that males cannot be raped have been female. 




 Oops. Well, it was one of the well respected accounts on this subreddit. But I agree with you completely.

I was about to say that the definition of whether a sexual act was rape should always be up to the victim, but that leaves the 'perpetrator' wide open to false accusations, which is a whole other problem. I really wish that people wouldn't make false accusations of rape, it really ruins the legal system for everybody else who is a genuine victim.  




 I thought it was 'female' that people were opposed to? Wtf?

Also, by their logic calling a man a guy, dude or bro is sexist.  




 There's a great statistic (well, horrible in real life, but great for the sake of the argument) that usually stops females who dismiss male rape as impossible - 50% of women orgasm when they are raped. I don't have a source for that but I read it somewhere on /r/sex and I remember there being a very reputable source, it may even have been /u/Maxxters that posted it. 

It's quite obvious when you think about these things that the body's physical reactions are different to what the mind is actually feeling.  




 Which uni are you at? If you're in Queensland I can probably recommend some student clubs to join or places to hang out.  




 You've got a circular process going on here. 

1) you've worked really hard and gotten a great body, haircut etc. However, you believe you have failed because girls still don't like you. 
2) girls don't like you because you're not self confident, despite the great body and so on. 
3) repeat step one, ad infinitum. 

I think you need to spend some time acknowledging the successes you have already made - which a lot of people never achieve - and not focus on the things you haven't quite gotten yet. Give yourself some credit for making a great transformation. And I bet that as soon as you do that you'll be beating the girls off with a stick.  




 I'm willing to bet that he's egotistical, has a very high opinion of his own intelligence, has 'high standards' that his partners must meet - and most importantly, is not really that bright himself.  




 Also, don't use seduction to fix those emotional issues.  




 That was actually the cheesiest porno I've ever watched. 




 I'm not criticising you, I'm judging the guy who criticised you.  




 That's fascinating, why do you think that is? 




 You're not even writing full sentences, what right do you have to judge? 




 finish in her 




 I used to think that I dressed reasonably well. I stumbled across this subreddit completely by accident, realised in about fifteen seconds that jorts and short sleeve button downs does not constitute 'dressing well,' and quickly fell in love with male fashion as a whole.  




 It sounds like she has the female version of death grip.  




 This joke is old, tired, untrue, and not in the least funny.  




 If the commenter was female talking about a male, the comment would not only be accepted but probably encouraged. 

And I bet you wouldn't criticise a girl for noticing an attractive member of the opposite sex.  




 Is a faggot by definition male? Surely there can be female faggotry? 




 I don't know, you said some useful things about a comment of mine yesterday.  




 It seems to me that you're absolutely right, so long as being 'yourself' means being a ripped, well-dressed, ruthlessly confident, socially outgoing alpha male with stacks of social proof. 




 *I'm 14 and have never played beer pong 




 I think it's less sexy if it's your only language.  




 Blunt honesty ahead: my penis, when unerect, is basically a carbon copy of what you described above - about three inches long, mostly squishy, and not terribly thick. That changes dramatically under certain circumstances, and I have no doubt that your guy is the same. I highly doubt that what you've seen was any kind of erection at all.  




 Really, shouldn't all relationships be best friends who have sex? That's how I view them.

Edit: I don't mean you have to be friends with them first, but that your SO should become your friend. I don't know how it would work otherwise.   




 Well, at least he's honest.  




 hard he sleeps

I see what you did there 




 You're absolutely right.  




 tyzorybyAGAIN is *technically* correct in that legally it's considered impossible to give your consent during sleep. But I highly doubt the male in question would be concerned.  




 Does anyone want the Hollywood Marshmallow? 




 I found this subreddit a week after I broke up with someone, nine months ago. Have been single since. Almost unsubscribed several times from sadness that I am missing out on fun things.  




 I last tested myself a few years ago, as a mid teens male with no muscle and enough fat to be solidly chubby. I was apparently so underweight that I should be hospitalised. Never trusted an online calculator since.  




 And while you're bending over backwards to make her happy, what is *she* doing to maintain your attraction to her? 




 This is the problem I have with the term 'natural' meaning 'not man made.' 




 I have depression and have recently started lifting. The gym I signed up for comes with three free sessions with a personal trainer. I met him for the first time an hour ago, and he's built like the fucking hulk. 

Turns out he's had depression for most of his life and has recently started on medication.  




 Especially when the average penis (meaning the majority of men) is 5 to 5.5 inches long when fully erect 




 Anyone who claims that their actions while intoxicated don't count is to me incapable of being responsible for their own actions.  




 But for this exact reason - if you like him and want something to happen, don't just ask him to hang out. *this is a subtle hint that will go way over his head.*
