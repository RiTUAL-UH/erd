 Thank you for that very interesting reply. This is helpful. I know it's weird that I am defending him at all but when I hear people talk like he is evil, I have to disagree. I just want more discussion and less blind followers who just agree with everyone else. People accuse me of being racist just for asking these things.

 I can see him reading about the crime from the Mexican border and getting all worked up and I think what he said and what he thinks he is saying are two different things. He just wants to emphasize the border problem. Yes he is stupid, but I want someone to really explain to him why what he said was wrong and not just say racism.
