 good luck and glad you are getting help  




 my cousin committed suicide on thursday morning. i am going through a tough time. i suffer from depression and have borderline personality disorder. i have been in and out of hospital and doctors about 50 times this year. i had a pain attack a few days ago and screamed down the house from all pain and anger. i screamed at the top of my voice for 5 minutes and someone down the road called the police so i had to explain everything to them. also my sister and mum are abusing each other and hit each other. i have two hospital appointments coming up. one is to get a ultrasound to check my ovaries because i have polycystic ovaries. the other one is to see a psychiatrist and to get accessed. i also collapse from stress and exhaustion. i sleep more than half the time. 

tell me its going to be okay and that its not the end of my world and i can get better
