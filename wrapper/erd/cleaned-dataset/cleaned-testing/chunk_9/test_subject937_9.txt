 Example? Is the stylized "N" for null (I think) a Hebrew character? 




 You are correct but not pedantic. A transgender person should be referred to as the gender they identify with. Refusing to do so is very insulting.

Of course, I don't fault anyone for not understanding this issue. The public is still learning. 




 Allowed but _not_ a good idea. Even with family, you will pay for what you get.

Ask your sister who she would hire if she wanted to file for divorce. That is her value as an attorney to you. 




 Guilty. 




 No it doesn't. You can be an [agnostic theist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic_theism) (you believe in a god but don't think that god's existence is knowable).

"Theism" refers to belief; "gnosticism" refers to knowledge claims.

If it's because he is _somehow_ popular, what is he advocating (albeit unsuccessfully) that appeals to his supporters. Do they think it is worth this much money?

 If he's as passionate as he seems, he may not sell out (at least for some time). 




 I think the broad principle works with the analogy. In our bodies, a certain stability and predictability is required to live (e.g., blood pumped must arrive where it needs to be).

On Earth, the same stability and predictability is required for life (e.g., winter must yield to spring).

The body and the Earth are both systems that require certain conditions to support life. If those conditions are removed, the systems will fail. 




 I am too. But we're talking about a pastor, not a CEO. 




 Because it's not possible. All it takes is a contradiction and there will be no resolution because neither will yield.

Racists made the argument in the 60's that integration violated their religious beliefs. But if segregation is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause and if both constitutional rights (i.e., the 1st Amendment rights of the racist and the 14th Amendment rights of the black students) allow for no restrictions, what is the result?

How can this be resolved without restricting one? 




  fire off into job land

Unfortunately for OP, Jobland has criminalized porn. 




 Man just fuck all of that. 




 I don't disagree, but a pastor should not be trying to make a $100,000 first impression. 




 Those words cannot be absolute. Reasonable restrictions on constitutional rights are necessary (immovable object vs. unstoppable force). I'm not making any judgment about the reasonableness of restrictions on either Amendment, though. 




 Both are excellent lessons in the dangers of pride. 




 Yes and yes.

 The companies will simply ask the legislature for immunity from lawsuits.

 You seem to be looking at this from an immature perspective. It's not about offending anyone or "staying classy".

First, if you ask someone you're casually dating if they're "fucking someone else", don't be surprised if you aren't soon dating them anymore.

Second, if you do ask in an appropriate manner, don't be surprised if the answer is something along the lines of "that's not your business".

Adults can have sex with whomever they want. If you're dating one (without exclusivity), it's really not your business. If you want to ask, go ahead - but accept the response and consequences of doing so.

Ultimately, if you want the right to be upset that someone else is "inside of" them too, then ask to be exclusive. This is not hard stuff. 




 It's not so much about being uninterested as it is about not being able to demand an answer to that question. Don't sleep with someone until you're exclusive if it's an issue for you. 




 An exclusivity talk is common. Once both of you agree to be exclusive, you are boyfriend/girlfriend. 




 Am I crazy or was Google Nearby supposed to be a thing? I can't find _anything_ about it other than the initial reports.

 Usually the counter-narrative makes a bit of sense but that's just ridiculous. 




 I'm cautiously optimistic about your candidacy. At the very least, you will force Hilary to take progressives more seriously.

Thank you for running!!! 




 Chick-fil-A proved that, even today, being bigoted is not necessarily bad for business.

History tells us that the market will not punish such behavior. Segregation only ended once the federal government required it to end.

That's... a lot of coke. 




  Opposition to marriage equality, though, does generally come from this religious corner.

Support of anti-miscegenation laws was based on religion as well.

Overall, however, I don't think opposition to interracial marriage and gay marriage was or is sincerely rooted in religion. It's rooted in bigotry.

 This doesn't strike me as a "reddit" question. 




 I think a footnote is warranted but I don't think it's unreasonable to leave it out.

The charges against him don't seem completely baseless. And if the investigation was not baseless, the withdrawal timeframe can reasonably be excluded from his delay time. (For instance, an acquittal in a criminal trial doesn't mean the trial itself was unjustified.) 




 His Wikipedia page states that he resigned in the face of an investigation and, while it cleared him, it criticized him for ethical lapses.

Do you have a source for your information? I'm still looking but your comments make it sound like he was left out for obviously partisan purposes.

Edit: The resignation was a separate incident from the nomination withdrawal. There's not much I can find on the nomination withdrawal but it seems like he was fairly controversial.

Edit 2: The New York Times had a pretty damning [editorial](http://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/29/opinion/mr-meese-should-withdraw.html) about why he should have withdrawn, and did Reagan's own then-Attorney General appoint the special prosecutor to investigate?

 It would be interesting to see the stats. Weddings cost a lot of money on top of what the bride and groom spend (guests rent hotel rooms, eat out, buy expensive clothes, rent tuxes, plan trips, etc.)

 If the facts are as reported, it is undeniably rape. Unconscious people cannot give consent. 




 Yep - there is nothing positive about what happened, or that the events are being reported.

What bothers me the most about the reporting and gossip is how her *rape* is being ignored or diminished. Having sex with an unconscious person is undeniably rape.

Shame all around. 




 I've seen the gif so many times but never the source. Incredible. 




 That completely changes the situation. We shouldn't publicly shame those with mental health issues. 









 To be fair to her, _she_ was the rape victim. 




 Is it click-bait if it delivers? 




 Roll with it. Not Augusta. Not Augusta!

  The fact that they're both called "marriage" is what's so hard about it.

Ostensibly, yes. But it's not _actually_ hard to understand. 




 As I read the intro, I kept waiting for the zinger. The Service was more tame than I expected. 




 What is so hard about recognizing there are two concepts of marriage: civil and religious?

The equality fight has always been about civil marriage. And civil marriage cannot be hamstrung by any particular religion's tenets. 




 But it's still in the book. If the Old Testament was followed "to the T", gays would be stoned. 









 Right to left, right? 




 But that's more of a legal quirk than a legitimate characteristic

The Vatican doesn't have much in common with other nation states. 




 That's sounds like false bravado.

  he can't know that unless he was told so in which case he would have a nice suit on his hands.

Without getting into a semantic fight over "know", I don't see why not. I'm sure past experience with racism creates patterns.

And surely you don't think that every legally actionable wrong is provable in court? 




 he's being pretty audacious to come on here and spout it as fact.

No, he's not. The rules of evidence weed out a lot of what can make something obvious but not legally provable. And that's when the non-excluded evidence is greater than 51%. Something that is 49% likely to have happened is still very likely to have happened. 




 Obvious to /u/ANegroNamedBreaker doesn't mean it is provable in court. 




 I counted 17 on the map. Who knows what will happen after this week but at least it's here.

 Dead for the year. Legislation can always come back, but the session is officially over for 2015. 




 Oh come on. Of course everyone's opinion of a city is going to be slightly different.

But you ranted and raved against the city as if your experience is a good indicator of daily life here.

I'll leave it be cause you obviously have a major chip on your shoulder. I'll just stand by my original response: don't listen to him, OP.

OP, if you want objective stats about crime, natural beauty, activities, quality of life, standard of living, job opportunities, future growth,  cost of living, etc., just use Google. Augusta is always ranked very highly.

Oh, and Savannah is much hotter than Augusta. But I do love Savannah. Great city. 




 Well, that's an eminently more reasonable position than "it's a shithole". 




 See, claiming there is no beauty here is proof that you are not evaluating the city objectively. Sure, you may have had a bad experience, but don't extrapolate and assume yours was universal.

I'd wager you haven't been here in quite a while. With the Cyber Command and the second highest growth rate in tech jobs in the country (yes, the country), you probably dislike something that you wouldn't even recognize.

But, hey, keep on hatin'. Good for the soul, right? 




 Ah yes, nothing impressive about the most prestigious golf tournament on the planet.

If you didn't enjoy it here, that's more than likely your fault, not Augusta's. Objectively, it's a great place to live.
