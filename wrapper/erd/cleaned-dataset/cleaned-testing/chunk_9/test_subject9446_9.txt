 This is Toby, our rescue, and he's 4-years-old. He looks like a tall border collie, but based on his personality and behavior, we think he's probably a black and white pointer mix. His life theme song is [Love is all you need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydfH7iuLR0I). 









 You bet! 




 Your cat has mastered the evil villain stare. I'd be afraid.

 I bet the TA didn't even give him partial credit. 




 Totally agree! Nothing like having this moment captured forever :)
Congrats! 









 Sadly, I was not. However, I'd be happy to apply if they're accepting applications :) 




 Crayons was my guess as well. Have any crayola products gone missing recently? 




 Huh, had never heard of that mix, but what a cute puppy!

(It is a cross between aLabrador Retriever and a Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog, for anyone else wondering) 









 This is why the rest of the universe hates Earthlings... 




 Gary was in charge of the parking squares. Damn it Gary, are you drunk again? 




 At least it didn't succeed failingly. 




 Even the gods use their phones to avoid social situations... 




 Can't...handle...the...cute... 




 Nothing like a little public shaming to encourage rule following... 




 Wishing you all the best!
Don't let the cynicism of some redditors get to you. My two years of marriage haven't been without challenges, but they've been the best of my life. 









 Ugh, dogs are so image conscious these days... 














 You bet! Glad you found it helpful :) 




 Huh, I didn't know that...fascinating stuff. 




 You rock. Keep on rocking.
