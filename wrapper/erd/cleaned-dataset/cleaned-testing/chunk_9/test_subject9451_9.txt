 My absolute favorite is Wendy's baconator with no bun and a side salad.
Taco bell soft tacos, and I just eat out of the shell with a spork. 
Again, Jimmy Johns unwich is the bees knees.

 Don't even bother driving to work, and start looking at job ads.  




 I saw a progress pic where OP lent credit to /r/keto so I clicked the link to check it out. At first I couldn't believe a word or a single photo that I saw. 

Many times ive fallen prey to weight loss gimmicks. Pay X amount of money and lose Y amount of weight in Z amount of time. I thought i learned my lesson, so I thought there was no way people were eating like this and losing so much weight so quickly. It had to be a scam. But I kept reading. I read /r/keto for half a day and i saw the emotional and physical changes everyone was enjoying. Then I realized this "program" doesn't cost anything. No books to buy, no membership fee, just a little effort. Within a matter of hours I decided I had nothing to lose, and very suddenly became  resolved to follow the diet. When I told my husband he was furious, saying it was unhealthy and it would be a greater risk to my health. After he saw my success and did his own research he started keto a week after I did.

I am so, so glad I took the chance. Keto is changing both my life and my husband's.  




 Oh man, my grandmother made me eat SO MUCH FOOD today! Including fried catfish, which was so so good but I felt so guilty about it.
But I turned down cake, pie and candy. I was so proud of myself!! Till I got to my mother in law's house and totally caved. Ate so much candy and chocolate.

I'm so disappointed in myself because I just got fully keto adapted last week and I'm pretty sure I ruined that today.

 Oh well, here's to another new day and a fresh start! 




 The same thing happened to me when I started Lexapro, I lost any desire I had for working out and I LOVED it before. 
It's something like the medicine making your brain produce the chemicals you'd normally get when you work out, so you're less inclined to do the work because you don't need the work to get the chemical reward. 
It's much more in depth than this and I'm probably not explaining it well. You may have to either push through it or talk to your doctor about switching meds..

Hope it gets better for you!

  It really comes down to exercising self-restraint and finding other methods of coping. And I mean literally exercising restraint - it takes work and time to get into it. Try planning ahead what you will eat. Don't confuse that with meal planning, but rather "I have a class at 3 pm that's close to this place, and I know I can get [healthy food] there."  There are apps that help you find fast food meals under 600 calories, my personal favorite is the KetoFinder app. From there you'll have to rely on your self control to make the right choice.

If you're having a lot of trouble, look up a recovery record app. It's really helpful both in the moment and in hindsight.

Hope this helps, best of luck  




 Congrats on your awesome progress and good luck on this new phase of keto!!

TIP: since you're so used to controlling your own intake very well, you'll probably forget to log MPF. In the settings there's an option for MPF to notify you on your phone when you fail to log a meal (breakfast,lunch and dinner). Also a lot of times I'll get lazy and input everything at the end of the day so I'm not always on my phone trying to find stuff all day. 




 I'm a female but I think I can weigh in here. I started boxing a little over a year ago and it's amazing for stress/anxiety relief. Going into a class environment made me feel very uncomfortable at first but you quickly realized everyone else has their head down and is just trying to keep going, same as you. It did amazing things for my confidence, strength and self  discipline. I just starting weight lifting a bit and it's making be feel better and better. If you can, I would recommend both! If you can't, I recommend starting off with boxing classes. Having a schedule to stick to builds a foundation for good habits, and once you have the self discipline to work out regularly  (a struggle for many here) you'll have an easier time picking up self paced bodybuilding.

Best of luck! 




 I started Keto 2 weeks and 1 day ago. My weight loss has stalled for about four days, but total I'm down 14lbs from my highest weight. My husband was *absolutely* against the Keto diet. He thought it was unhealthy and wrong. When he started to *see* how much better I looked and felt within a week, he did research and started the diet, too. That was a week ago and he's down 13 pounds. 

Yes, everyone is different, but they all have one thing in common: progress. It might be weight loss, increased energy, blood work improving, or just a general feeling of well-being, but Keto delivers.

It's surprisingly easy, so don't get analysis paralysis. Just stick to your macos and things will improve. Also,
[this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah8MbmZepQxWdGo4bnB2QmxxMUlmTzZUTXYzMURRLWc#gid=0) is extremely easy to understand and has saved my life over the last few weeks, especially while eating out. 

Good luck!! 




 I have noticed this too!! Sometimes I do miss carbs but only when I get really hangry and frustrated cause I can't eat right away. I'll think "it would be so easy to drive into that McDonald's and get a box of fries." But I have yet to seriously consider it.  




 I thought so, too! Very clever and resourceful! 









 Fantastic writing, *stunning* progress photos, and a truly inspiring story. Congratulations on your incredible success!! 




 I've gotten some truly amazing support on /r/keto. Everyone there is so nice and positive, I'm on it almost every day because of those awesome people.
