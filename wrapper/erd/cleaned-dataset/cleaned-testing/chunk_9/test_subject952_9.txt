 If you don't have a PlayStation system, I'm on xbone if you still haven't done it! GT: Moreos 




 Can someone explain what the Voice Identification Notification is? I clicked the link but the video is four hours :/ 




 Yes there is a setting to be able to hear yourself. 




 Awesome, thanks. 




 Thanks for the offer, I think I got it all figured out now lol. Currently buying it! 




 Thanks for the help! 




 Thanks I'm lazy lol  




 Yes I would like to type things with it. 




 I'm sorry for being retarted, but what is a USB dongle and how much are they? 




 I have turtle beaches xo one, and they are fantastic! Very comfortable on the ears and great audio quality. I'm on mobile right now but I will post a link to a pair as soon as I get home! 




 Mine took about a week, some people's probably took longer. Just be patient, it will come :) 




 Are you on XB1? That kid may have been me :) 




 When I turned my Xbox on right now I was already signed out. 




 Lana. Laaana. Laaaana. LAAAAAAAAANNNNNAAAAAAAA!!!! 




 Dude. Use soap. Wash your body. Eww. 









 Its there!  




 Yes 




 Typically 12-13 




 wut 




 I just ignore ratings, really. I've played so many games with 18+ ratings (CoD, GTA, literally every game except Destiny ever). Oh no, it showed a boob! Oh no, he said "fuck"! Who the hell cares, honestly? 




 Xbox 360, Xbox 1, Ps3

Not really 




 Really obsessed with Destiny right now, also been playing a bit of Borderlands 2 and Witcher 3  









 Still looking for a swordbearer?
 




 I do, actually. My dad is a cop since I was pretty little he would take me to the range every weekend. I now have a couple rifles to take with me.

My username was an old Xbox Gamertag. About a year ago when I made this account I couldn't think of anything else so I just stuck with it.

I'm having a "falling out" (I can't think of another word, sorry) with my parents, but I guess that's it.

Lol, that's all I have to say for that one. Yeah, it's *SUPER DUPER* being 13!!!!!!!!1!1!1111

Being able to shave(no, really) everyone else does it, and I grow hella hair.
 




 People, places, just anything really. I carry my camera with me almost every time I go anywhere. 




 I'm getting Witcher 3 soon, it looks really good from what I've seen  




 I really want to be either a video game designer or a photographer. 




 Sorry, it was late and I didn't get any replies until about an hour later, so I gave up and went to sleep. 









 It's a tie, neither teams get a point. 




 Strikes. 




 "For what lays ahead". At least you tried... 




 Adding you tomorrow as well, GT is Moreos so you know who I am. 




 Hey there! I know I'm a little late to this thread, but I will be adding you when I get on tomorrow, I could use more good PvP players, and I love hearing lame jokes! My GT is Moreos, just so you know who I am. 




 Looking for a group of very experienced players for trials. Going for a minimum of 6 wins, although going 9-0 is nice. Invite Moreos. 




 Yes, I'll be on from around 3:45 to 7:30 tomorrow. 




 I can take you through them! Just message Moreos, I'll be on tomorrow! 




 I'm on xb1 as well. Though I am not in a "clan" I have some regular people I play strikes and raids with. If you want to play with us, PM me your GT and I'll add you as soon as I can :) 




 Same. 




 Yep. Again.  




 Message Moreos on XB1 for an invite. 

(Normal Mode) 




 Alright, whenever you're on! 




 Will do! 




 * XB1

* PST (California)

* 32 Warlock and Hunter, 30 Titan

* Just play to help people out, can solo Crotas End and one sword the boss. Can two sword HM, solo nightfalls, etc. Just invite if you need help with anything.

* Mic: Yes (I'm a 13 y/o girl, although I don't scream or anything I can mute my Mic if you prefer)

* GT: Moreos 




 Ahh, tomorrow is the ONLY day out of the week I can't play! Does Wednesday, around 3:30 to 7:00 PST work for you? 




 I'm on XB1, I can teach you how to anytime. I can one sword Crota and solo him, more than qualified to teach. You do not need to be a 32 to down him. I can also show you in any of your other characters. Message Moreos next time your on :) 




 You're Divergent. 




 Yeah It did that for a sec now it says 0 friends online again  




 Cool , I'm on almost every day. 




 Send me a message whenever you need help! 




 I'm on xb1, I can raid with you whenever (even solo the whole thing if you want) my GT is Moreos, you can send a message whenever.

 Why would you duct tape your boobs? 









 Lol no 




 That's great, I'm Pacific time, so that works out with my home schedule. 

I understand, it would be great to give someone that first experience, I still remember my first VoG sherpa! 




 * Xbox one 
* PST/ California
* 32 Hunter (main), 32 warlock, 30 Titan 
* I basically just help people in this game, now. I Sherpa, solo raids, even help people farm strikes or materials. Just add me if you ever need help on anything, I will be there.
* Mic: yes 
* GT: Moreos

The most badass 13 y/o girl you have ever met. 




 Public events, do at least one a day. That and VoG. Daily Heroic gives 2 ascendant mats, make sure you do that every day. What do you mean by"real late"? I'm a child, so Fridays and Saturdays I can be on till about 1 or 2 am. 




 So The Vault of Glass raid. All of the chests give shards and energies. If you have never done VoG and are on Xbox one pm me and I can take you through! 




 LF5M or LFG. 30 titan, plenty of experience with maxed fatebringer /black hammer/ gjallarhorn. Invite 




 Same, I just found a group for Crota hard mode :( 




 Who said he works? Where does it say that? 




 32 Hunter, bored, helping groups run sword. Message Moreos if you need a swordbearer. 




 Message Jade Sueta for an invite. Please have experience and tracking rockets. We have Swordbearer. 




 31 Hunter, on my alt, plenty of exp, max gally. Inv me. GT: Jade Sueta. Looking for fresh run. 




 NM or HM, I'm good at both. Shoot me a message my GT is Jade Sueta. Can guarantee a kill.
