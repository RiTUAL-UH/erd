 I'm in the same boat as you. My gynecologist stopped delivering babies a long, long time ago, so I'm searching for an OB. I've decided on the hospital where I want to deliver, and I've been searching for OBs that deliver there and accept my insurance. I've Googled some of the OBs and found reviews on other pregnancy message boards, which has been extremely useful. It seems highly recommended to not wait until you're pregnant to meet your new OB or midwife, so it's good you're starting your search early. Babycenter.com has a nice [list of questions to ask when searching for a midwife](http://assets.babycenter.com/ims/Content/Midwife_interview_sheet.pdf). 

Anyway... I believe you choose one or the other; you don't need both. There are practices out there that have both OBs and midwives though. You could also have a hospital birth with a midwife (there are so many damn options, aren't there?!). I found this information which is good to know:

Be aware that if you start out with a midwife and develop a problem down the road  such as premature labor or preeclampsia  or find out that you're having twins, your care will be transferred to an obstetrician or perinatologist. (Depending on your condition and the practitioners' arrangements, you may be able to have a midwife and a physician handle your care together, if you like.) 




 Best of luck. I found this little pre-interview pep talk that you might enjoy reading: [Link](http://i1123.photobucket.com/albums/l543/hercampusphoto/Lauren%20articles/career/peptalk.jpg). Confidence is key to a successful interview. I'm sure you'll rock it!

 




 Yep. The thought of him being an amazing dad is what originally gave me baby rabies. When I was first dating my husband, I was stalking his Facebook page and came across a post where he said his biggest dream is to be a dad. I think my ovaries exploded that day.  




 Except Monopoly almost always ends in rage quit...  




 So every B amp;N is participating?! Sounds so cool. I need to talk to people. My husband is getting pissed that I keep spoiling the books (currently on Voyager).  




 Are you and I the same person? I started a wish list about a week ago, spent 2 hours one night making it because I was so bored. I only ever talk about baby related stuff; I'm starting to worry if my husband things I'm insane. I'm always reading about how to raise kids and constant worry about being a good mom, which my husband claims is adorable and sweet. I have baby names picked out and often use these names when referring to our future kids (all names are husband approved). So far, I've crocheted 3 baby blankets and one dress in the last month or so and I'm itching to make more baby stuff. I have researched OBGYNs and already know where I want to deliver. I think I need an intervention. Please send help.  




 Fun fact: his costar on Masters of Sex played Janis Ian on Mean Girls.  




 Congrats on the marriage :) good luck! 




 I've had a pharmacist catch a potentially fatal drug interaction that my primary care physician completely missed when prescribing me medicine. Needless to say, I am thankful that pharmacists are so knowledgeable about drugs.  




 How are kids supposed to summon Satan if they don't know how to play Hot Cross Buns?! 




 I've spent the last two hours looking at stuff on Amazon and adding things to a wish list. This is all your fault haha.
 




 Aw, I'm glad I could help! Best of luck to the two of you.  




 I'm not early in a relationship, but I'm 23 and I was once in your shoes. I started dating my husband when I was 19 and he was 20. At first, I didn't have any urge to have a baby. However, after a month of dating we were already talking about our future; marriage and family and whatnot. I don't know what the hell happened, but one day I started thinking about babies and couldn't stop. I was so madly in love with him (still am, of course) and just could not wait to start a family with him. It hurt so bad knowing we weren't ready to have children, but it was true: we absolutely were not ready. For us, the timing was not right. We were only sophomores in college at the time, unwed, and barely had any money. Plus, my family could barely swallow the fact that we had gotten engaged after only dating for 3 months, they probably would've been disappointed if I had gotten pregnant. The thought of trying to juggle school and a kid on so little income without my family's full support terrified me. So, although we hated doing so, we were very careful to prevent pregnancy.

It's been almost 4 years since I first started dating my husband. I've obviously never stopped desiring to have a baby with him. Am I sad that we don't have a baby? Yes. Am I happy we didn't end up having one? Also yes. In the last 4 years, we got married, took advantages of opportunities while in college, graduated college with highest honors, and DH has gotten an amazing job and a promotion. We've been able to get out of credit card debt and now we are able to save money for a house. I know that everything we've done would've been so much more difficult and stressful with a baby, so even though I would love to have had a baby by now, I feel waiting was the best choice for us. Honestly, we kept ourselves busy, and these last 4 years have flown by. I can't believe we are so close to TTC. 

I've tried to not think about it so much by taking advantage of the time I have with my husband. One day it won't be just you and your SO anymore, so enjoy that time while you still got it. Also keep in mind that there probably won't be a time when you and SO will feel 100% ready for a baby; there isn't ever a perfect time to have one. When you accept that fact, you're "ready" for baby. 

Maybe you'll feel better if you and your SO have a nice talk about the future and set a time frame. If I didn't have a time frame for buying a house and TTC, I'd lose my mind. 

TL;DR: You're not alone. The waiting sucks, but at the same time, sometimes it's for the best, at least until you're more certain it's what you and SO want. Maybe set a time frame to give yourself something to look forward to, and keep your mind occupied so the baby rabies won't consume you. 




 "Take her to the moon for me, okay?"

God damn you, Bing Bong.  




 That's what I thought. Thank you! 









 My mother and sister both deal with endometriosis (not sure about fibroids, but it sounds familiar. I know Mom would always get cysts that had to be surgically removed though). Anyway, neither one had issues with getting pregnant. I hope this doesn't add any barriers for you.  




 And yet here we are, indefinitely, waiting on my husband's general feelings of not being ready.

If everyone waited until they feel 100% ready to have a baby, hardly anyone would have babies...
