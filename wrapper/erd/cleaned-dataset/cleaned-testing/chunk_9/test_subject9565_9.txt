 LOL i barely did but thats so weird.  




 Big age difference, she probably sees you as her younger brother 

sorry bro  




 Sorry, cheating is wrong and dump his ass. And your mother needs to find guys her own age.  




 Fresh start of a new year! You surround yourself with good friends and it will help you out through the difficult situation.  




 Your ex girlfriend grandmother is  generous, $300 for a birthday present. You don't owe your girlfriend anything. It's a gift, not a library book. There is no returns on gift. Once you give a gift, don't expect it back. That's the whole point of gift giving!  




 I'm sorry but it is not your parents responsibility to pay for your fiance's brothers schooling. It's inappropriate and if you give the money to the brother, i have a feeling they'll ask for more money since they are ''family''   




 AGREED 




 TBH i wouldn't call this relationship because you haven't even seen pictures of her or even video called her.

"He told me he catfished isn't because he's gay, but because he likes to roleplay as a girl. Because he said he wondered what it would be like to be born as a girl and stuff like that'' he's gay and theres nothing wrong with that.  




 50/50
way way back 




 Reese Witherspoon 
She won an Oscar than did really shit movies until this year. 




 I hope you had a good new years up in heaven. I know you must be celebrating with beer and relaxing somewhere wherever you are. It only has been almost a month since you have passed away, but you are always here in my heart. 

Miss you dad  




 I bake because it's a great distraction  




 My father just died. I know it's hard but you need closure and say your goodbyes  




 I'm currently in the washroom on the floor while writing this so im sorry if nothimg makez sense. After my dad battling cancer for four years and since September it has been downhill it's hard to know how you are going to feel when you are actually in that position.  It sucks big time being in a room surrounded with people crying. I hate it and I feel so overwhelmed because it happened in a snap of fingers. It sucks and I have exams starting tomorrow. I'm going to stay strong because my dad would want that for me. 

I believe in this saying with every curse there is a blessing. 

Because of the decline of my dad's health I matured and now I can cook and be more independent.  

I needed to vent 

Thanks 




 I might of misread the post but didn't the gf and the friend talk about having sex together  




 I'm a girl and I do not spoon with my other friends that are girls. If they are talked about sex obviously there's something your gf isn't telling you- they may be attracted to  each other  




 It's unfornate but you need to surround yourself with people who will be there for you and support you. Your mom is in denial and your step dad is a smuck.  You don't deserve it I mean no one does. Your daughter sounds lovely! 




 The title makes it seem like your the victim when it's really your boyfriend or shall I saw should be your ex. You are young 17 years old. But, you made the choice to cheat and you should have to pay with the consequences.   




 Frozen  




 It took me a while to feel confident enough to go on the road. It worked out that I had the car every day and it boosted my confidence.  Drive a little each day 




 If your dad can't respect your sexuality then that his loss.  




 I'm hearing impaired and I get so many complaints that I talk too loud. I wish there was a device to hear how loud I am. I also hate it that people do not know the difference between hearing impairment and deaf.  




 I found baking to be very therapeutic. It's great to find a way to something like focusing on your loved ones. Depression isn't easy, but its great you found a way to not let it get to you 




 Thank you! 




 Hi, I'm new at this subreddit. I just started cooking recently and I'm making a meal for my mom tomorrow. I was wondering if anyone could give me a easy recipe to follow! THANKS :) 




 My dad has a rare form of pancreatic cancer (Steve Jobs had it) since Sept 2010. My dad still worked and was able to live his life besides the one set back.  Before my dad went to the hospital, I couldn't bake and cook for my life. I relied a lot on my mothers cooking. Things went for a turn for the worst when he went to the hospital Canadian Thanksgiving weekend and has been ever since. We found out the cancer is terminal since there is no cure. The radiation is just to slow it down so its a matter of when.   Since my mom is rarely home for dinner I found a new passion for baking/cooking. It is so therapeutic for me. Now I can bake from cookies to apple cakes as well as cook chicken  fish. I don't know how I cope with everything but I'm so thankful I found baking. I love seeing the smiles of peoples faces when I give to to them. I don't eat a lot of my baked goods because I want to give it to others and make their day because I know it would make mine. I'm writing this because these past few months have been difficult and not easy with keeping up with school but if you or anyone is in a similar situtation. Finding something to distract you for a bit and make you happy even for a minute can make a difference and make things a tad bit easier! Plus Taylor Swift since her album came at a perfect time. Going in the car and blasting her music (been a fan since 06) is one of my favourite things about my day.

FYI: do have depression and last year was VERY difficult for me because I started to have suicidal thoughts. But baking/movies help me! I do have friends I don't have many but I got a good group of people.  




 I don't know about you, but him saying this sort of shit would make me want to dump him. I mean hey, why keep them there if they aren't going to be there for you if this happens.  




 It's great to have an online community where you can express how you feel  




 He is clearly has eyes on another girl and using ''poly'' as an excuse.  




 No No no, I noticed that something was off. My sister told me she was engaged and I didn't feel anything. I told my social worker and she said I should go to the doctor to talk about my feelings. Social workers cannot diagnose.  




 It takes time to be comfortable to open up. I'm with a social worker for a year now. It took me 8 months to finally tell her what I'm feeling which led to me being diagonsed with depresison.  




 Your not alone and sadly its more common than you think. I know two people that had their fathers die suddenly. It's really hard for them to cope. I may not know what its like, but I'm facing a similar situation. My father has cancer- the one Steve Jobs has. He's at the hospital and theres no cure. Find something to  help you through this difficult time- I bake, watch movies and I cook. I also like to humour people so all those help me through it. You are not alone. I'm so sorry.  




 I know what you are going through currently. I am going through the same thing. My sister spent her birthday at the hospital as well while my father is in the hostipal. You should treat yourself to something, maybe there is something that you want like maybe a massage or something. Keep your head up high! PM if you need to vent! 




 I did it, it was the right thing to do thank you 




 I did it, it was the right thing to do thank you 




 This is me and his first relationship! Me and Bob (fake name) were dating for 4 months. My father is in the hospital and my dad cancer is not treatable. He has a rare form of pancreatic cancer the one that Steve Jobs had. I went to a hospital 2 hours away from home because my dad has a good relationship with them for the past four years and they specialize in his type of cancer.  My friends have been texting more than my then boyfriend and for 3 days he did not text me. He did say if I need to talk to him, he's there but i was pissed because for 3 days I didn't get a single message from him so after thinking about it because I know it must be hard but I warned him on the first date about my dad. I know its hard, but how long does it take to send a text? 2 seconds! So I dumped him because he wasn't being there for me. I wanted closure so a few days after I texted him, he got confused on the texting part if it was after the breakup or when he was in the hospital. So I told him 3 days i was in the hospital, he just send a text how he wants to meet in person to try and work this out. I'm conflicted and I really do not need anymore stress than I do now.

**tl;dr**: Should I hear my then boyfriends ''reasons''?  




 My dad has a rare form of pancreatic cancer for four years (since Sept 2010). Recently a tumour in the liver exploded about a month ago and that's when things got downhill. I found out yesterday the radation is to slow things down and to keep the few healthy liver cells alive. We do not know if it's going to work. He hasn't had a appiette in a week and today he had one as well as very alert. He told me that he is going to die but he wants to die with dignity. It just sucks knowing that your father won't be here. I just want the waiting game to be over. 




 It's not a healthy relationship if you both see eachother all the time and whenever you don't see her she guilts you by saying something stupid. You should go on the trip. You want to go, you should go.   




 When my dad cancer got worse I felt like my whole world turned grey. I didn't enjoy past hobbies like I used to and when my sister told me she was engaged I felt empty. Luckily I realized being open about depression helps me a lot.
