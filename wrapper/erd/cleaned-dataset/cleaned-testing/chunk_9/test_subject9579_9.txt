 I started at 20, they increased to 30 about 6 weeks ago and now I'm at 40.  




 I forgot to mention, yes, I am taking medication: Citalopram. I've been taking it since the end of January, my doctor just upped my dosage last week. 

It seemed to be helping by the time that I left the hospital (at that point I had been on it about 5 weeks) but I've sorta crashed since then.  




 It won't make a difference. Whether I want it or not, she can divorce me for whatever reason (or no reason at all) in this state. 

Furthermore, I no longer have any interest in being with her. She totally abandoned me while I was in the hospital and started her relationship with her boyfriend behind my back after telling me that she wanted to be separated for awhile to 'get some space' and that we could work on things between us after some time had passed. Oh, and also repeatedly saying that she had no intention or interest in seeing other people; that was definitely NOT the reason she wanted a divorce.

Honestly I was done when she told me while I was in the hospital that she 'couldn't support me'.  And while I don't think I ever would have been happy with her seeing someone else she could have at least been an adult and upfront about it but that was apparently too much to ask.

The best part was when I confronted her about it, she continued to deny she was seeing someone (and tried to convince that I was being paranoid/crazy) until I presented her with proof. And then she told me that as far as she was concerned we were separated as of the day I checked myself into the hospital so she didn't owe me anything after that point.  




 Yeah. Her actions since about January have been really selfish. When she declared she wanted a divorce I wanted to try counseling but she refused. 

Basically she had made a decision and I was just supposed to accept it.  




 I don't really know what happened between me and my wife either which is the part my problem. 

We had our issues, both together and separate but I'm general I thought we were pretty happy. Or at least OK. So, I was pretty blindsided by her announcement that she wanted a divorce. 

There wasn't anything drastic that happened before her decision either. No big fights, no infidelity (at least on my part) and she refuses to discuss with me what made her decide. 

So, yeah. I don't know. It might be easier to focus on something obvious that went wrong (or maybe not, I don't know) but I don't have that so I keep ending up at 'I'm the something wrong'

Right now my kids are about the only reason I haven't killed myself. But I have to wonder how good of a parent I am and can continue to be feeling the way I do. 

I used to have good times and bad times but since about December it's been all bad. Even when I was feeling a little better after my discharge I still wasn't happy. Wouldn't they be better off without growing up with a super depressed father?

I just can't find any hope that things will improve and that sucks.  




 I would say you're not doing anything wrong, you just haven't found the right guy yet. 

Everyone has different sex drives and preferences, these two guys sound like they just don't fit with yours and that is OK. 

Dating sucks, I know.  I'm recently single in my 30s as well. I think the only thing you can do is keep meeting people and you can find someone who clicks with you both in and out of the bedroom. 

Don't think there is something wrong with you and don't change. You'll be happier as yourself.  




 No. You should still be able to open the chest as long as it's your quest (obviously if you're tagging along you can't)

I've made 4 artifact chests and still get the chests at the end of the daily lairs. 

I would suggest putting in a support ticket, you're losing out on your sigils and pages by not having access to the chests.  




 They should figure it out because this is an out of character response for him. According to OP anyway, her info is all we have to go on here. 

And also because people need to be as self aware as possible. Figuring out why he feels the way he feels will benefit him as a person and both of them as a couple. 

If he were a more jealous person then maybe I'd feel better writing it off to just that by according to her this is an odd response. 

Like I said, it is reasonable for him to be upset but that's not the reaction everyone would have. It's not an automatic assumed response to the situation.  Some people would react this way all the time but the fact that she feels it's odd means it should be explored. At least in my opinion, which is all I'm giving here.  




 I didn't say it was unreasonable for him to get upset. I said it was a silly thing to get upset over. There is a difference. Obviously, in his mind, it is perfectly reasonable. 

I also said that his feelings need to be acknowledged because, silly or not, he IS upset. 

His feelings are acceptable just as OP's are. He is upset, she feels it's a silly thing to be upset over; I happen to agree on that part. BUT, that doesn't invalidate how he is feeling. 

I think the important thing here is to figure out why he got upset. Because it is a silly little thing I believe there is something else going on.  




 You had just seen a movie with this guy in it, so of course he was on your mind when you had to come up with a name. 

Is it a silly thing for your BF to get upset about? Yes!

But, I guarantee you that hearing you say that it is silly is the last thing he needs. 

He is upset about it (for whatever reason) and he needs you to acknowledge that he is upset, not dismiss it.  He (or the both of you) need to figure out why he's so upset. Is he jealous of this guy for some reason? Is he feeling distant in your relationship and a little insecure?

Tell him you'll discuss things with him calmly (if he wants). Let him know that you love him and that you're happy with him (provided that you actually are, don't lie to him) and that its unlike him to act like this.   If he starts getting angry at you again, at any point, try not to get defensive; just tell him that you would like to help him figure this out but you're not going to accept anger towards yourself and end the conversation. Go to another room, give him time to cool down. 

Hopefully you guys can figure this out. 

Good luck.  




 Sorry that your boy's father is such a jerk. 

The good news is you have your parents support, that's more than a lot of people get. 

Focus on your pregnancy, have a happy, healthy baby. Take whatever steps you need to get his father to pay child support (he owes you that). Go back to school when you can. Your dating prospects may be a little bleak for the near future but that's ok, your son needs your focus now anyway. 

You'll be ok.  




 You've been with him for years, you know him, he knows you, you guys are relatively happy. 

Sure, he has flaws, everybody does. The good news is that you know a lot of his already. So use what you know and ask yourself some questions. 

Do you want a future with him? Are his flaws something you can live with over time? The ones you think you can't live with (if any), do you have a realistic hope of him changing them?

The children thing is a non-issue I think, and here is why.  It's not your problem. You have made it clear that you don't want children.  He is aware. Don't take it on yourself to decide not to be with him because of this. Let him be an adult and decide for himself. 

If you decide you want a future with him, let him know. 'Hey, BF, I love you and I think we are good together. I want a future for us and I think these things need to change for us to be happy long term (insert appropriate action items). Do you feel the same? Are there things that you feel should change to ensure our happiness?'

Go from there. If he doesn't want a future or the things he wants to change are unacceptable (ie having children) then you both should move on. 

It's ok to be unsure in a relationship, it doesn't mean you're destined to fail. The one sure way to fail is to not communicate. Talk things out with him, either on your own or with a therapist. Just don't jump to conclusions and assume anything. 

You've been with him for a long time but you can't read his mind, nor can he read yours. Remember that.  




 First, spending time alone together outside of the house is a great idea. Call it date night or whatever you want but you need to do it. You and your husband need to be able to stay connected as a couple, not just get stuck into your roles as parents. If you guys feel silly calling it 'dating' because you're 'too old' then don't call it that. Call it 'quality time' or 'adult night' or 'We still love our daughter but need time to build our relationship or we're going to end up disconnected and hate each when she goes to college'

As for finding a babysitter you have a few options. There's a few websites out there that offer services either directly or through referral to get a babysitter. Sittercity.com is one I have used. They do background checks on all the babysitters/nannies on their site so you don't have to and you can conduct your own interview process before having a trial run. Also, I would suggest having a trial run, invite the sitter over to spend time with your daughter while you or your husband (or both) are around so you can see their interaction and decide if you're comfortable with that person. Maybe an afternoon where they can do homework together and then an activity or something. 

Another option is to get to know the parents of your daughter's friends. Have play dates and work your way up to having overnights with one or two friends. I'm sure you can find some parents willing to trade off sleepovers so each of you can have a date night (or whatever you end up calling it). 

Tell your husband that you feel stuck in a rut and something needs to change. You guys need alone time to renew your relationship. It may sound all stupid and new-agey but it is important.  




 This is a tricky subject because, of course he gets to have a private life and you don't have the right to dictate who he sees and doesn't see. 

On the other hand, as you stated, this part of his life is spilling over and affecting your relationship and that's a problem. 

If this was an ex that he had split with and remained friends or become friends with after it would be an easy answer: you back off.

But that's not what has happened here. They had a nasty breakup and she doesn't respect the relationship he has now (or you, as his gf). Add on the fact that his leftover issues from that relationship were causing problems before she even resurfaced. 

I agree that he should cut contact with her. Don't answer any calls or texts, block her on every option available (email, Facebook, etc). But you should also find out why he wants to talk to her in the first place. What need or fantasy is being met by having her constantly around and trying to get back together?  If he really had gotten closure when they met up I feel like he wouldn't still need anything from her.  




 Correct. The unlock cost is one time. After it is unlocked you can find it in the Queues menu and run it as many times as you like.
