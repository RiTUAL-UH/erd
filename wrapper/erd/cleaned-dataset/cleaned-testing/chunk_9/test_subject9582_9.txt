 He sure is [purty.](http://imgur.com/a/GY8z5) 




 Charlie Mans..no he cool. Ted Bund.. he's cool too. Bill Cos.. nah he's cool. Justin Beiber is my answer. 




 Edison electrocuting the elephant to prove he could do more than Tesla.

Trent Reznor even used it in his Downward Spiral videos. 




 So did you just shave it, or try to grasp at some dignity? 




 I just watched a clip on youtube, and it looks good. 




 Why have I not seen this?
 




 I saw that on HBO, and I hated the earwig scene as a kid. It scared the shit outta me. 




 Yep, saw that one. 




 I was six or seven for Empire. Rode in the back of a station wagon with three-four of my cousins. 




 Oh, my bad. 




 Great movie. 




 I saw Empire at a drive in, but I was only 1 when Star Wars came out. 




 Was that Jim Carrey's first? 




 Mine was E.T. 









 Put down the liquor Lahey! 




 I didn't even know why I liked her at six years old. She just made me feel funny in my wiener. 




 Mama always said she used to be hot or something. I never understood why she didn't use a fan or go swimming. 




 Two people can't fall in love over the course of a year? I don't find it rushed at all, I just think it happened at the most inopportune time. 




 "If you build it, they will come."?  Field of Dreams 




 Yea, it got leaked from comic con. Google it. 




 Once they come they would be there for the kick, that's all. Maybe they would stay, and help out with a proper commune. You never know man, if you build it, they will come. 




 Me too, but my daughters are singing it again now that I played it.
 




 What if when the kids are grown and out of the house, we buy a large area with hills, rocks, fishing, hiking, and camping. Then we'll turn it into a rehab. No drugs there except cannabis. Too many of our friends are fucked up on that junk. 

Fuck boys, I think we have our twelve year plan. Large house with pole barns and what not. We would farm, of course. You could stay, and we would help you with your sickness. Counseling, games, community, structure, something to do other than shoot up. 




 He went to Tonk's parents house first before taking the brush/portkey to the burrow. The ministry did not know about the protections set up at the other six houses IIRC. 




 I just have original Colossus at a 13, I need to buy that uni. 




 My setup is very strong, but everything I did would only take off a couple hundred at a time. Even Deadpool's giant weapon. 




 Awesome! 




 We need to find him! 




 I will agree with all but your tl;dr.

Harry and Ron showed incredible bravery that night in the chamber, but I think Neville was the *TRUE* Gryffindor in Harry's year. 




 RAWR! Is /u/chaosattractor all hopped up on Mountain Dew? 




 I killed you and the other pretty quick, but even with 3 on 1, it took like 20 minutes to beat Colossus. Did you see him in the Deadpool tralier? 




 1: Is incorrect. Dobby defied the Malfoys and had to punish himself accordingly. I think he was just a very odd elf.

2: James was a bit of a toerag, but as he got older, he learned the error of his ways. 




 I would assume he stayed at Hogwarts because Harry was never the type to assume ownership of anyone. Kreacher was a very old elf after all. 




 It's sometimes called hogwort or hogweed. A Goolgle search should help you. 




 It's my headcanon that Albus sent protectors to all of Harry's known relatives in case of an attack by the remaining DEs, but there is no proof for that. 




 I know! It was completely fucked! 




 Are you serious? John and Yoko? 




 Was Wendy a metamorphmagus? 




 Watch the other ninety minutes. I'm at the end now. 









 Yea, I have read everything John wrote. He/she is awesome. 




 His skull. 




 
True, in HBP. OotP Harry doesn't want to use it because he thinks it will get Sirius in trouble by way of sabotage or him doing something irrational. 




 That is awesome. Thanks for cluing me in on that. 




 Sirius gave Harry that mirror as he was heading back to Hogwarts with Tonks and them on the Knight Bus after Christmas in OotP.

I just read that again a couple of days ago. But I agree, use the damn mirror before you go rushing into an ambush. 




 If it was just piss, shit, and water- that's cool. That shit has chemicals in it. 




 Wow. 









 That's just Sirius lashing out because Azkaban made him a bit loopy. 




 Mine too! 




 Shows what I know. 




 ..it is definitely 4:14, My Lucky Charm. 

It was not their (JD and Turk) business to call the cops on someone who was trying to care for someone. It's their business to heal the sick. 




 HA! 









 tl;dr buddy. I'm not spending my night arguing with you, I have better things to do. 




 You're not telling me nothing new buddy. I know that's what he used at Hagrid's hut, Hermione used it at 12GP, Selwyn or Travers used it, and that's about all we know. Wiki is not all canon, some is fanon. 




 What the...

...not *all* of them. 




 **Home**num Revelio, therefore it only works in a **home.** 

Hogwarts is a home to some, but it's main purpose is a school. Just my headcanon, but I don't think it works like that. 




 No, the school was not empty. There were students and staff there, therefore *homenum revelio* would not have worked because the spell shows people in a dwelling, not necessarily a school where there is always someone there. 

I do not appreciate your tone. 




 You're correct, it's a bearded dragon.
 




 Aha! I was waiting for that. HR wouldn't be possible at Hogwarts because there are simply too many people there. 




 Brassballs because my mother used to call me that and it stuck. 




 I tripped Eddie Vedder once. 




 Yes! but I have to go with Pisces Iscariot. 




 That was my bible in high school.  




 Tupac could. 




 King *of* Pop 




 August and Everything After 




 What in the text supports yours? I think that if it had been planned that way all year, it would have been where it was at the end of the year. 




 That's interesting, never heard that before.
 




 I still don't think so. I don't think he used that as the final task until he realized that he and Harry were spending way too much time in front of it. 




 It wasn't placed under the trapdoor until it was needed, when the other professors set up the other tasks to get to it. That was one of Dumbledore's more genius ideas if he did say so himself.

It's my idea that he knew it was bad for both himself and Harry. 




 No. It didn't have that purpose at the time. It was just the mirror of Erised. 









 Not at the time though. It was moved under the trapdoor after that, remember? 




 That's what I mean, do you think he was using it first? 




 Don't forget the summer between 5 and 6 when he was fool enough to put the ring on to see his family again. I believe he was very weak when it came to the mirror. 




 When Albus found Harry staring into the mirror, and the whole 'it does not do to dwell' speech.

There is no way he (Albus) could have known Harry was there unless he was already in the room staring into the mirror of desire himself.

It's my theory that Dumbledore was looking into the mirror and heard the door open, so he backed into the shadows and disillusioned himself. When he didn't see anyone open and close the door, he assumed it was Harry because he had just given him the cloak on Christmas.

Albus probably stood there and let Harry enjoy one more bit of time looking at his family before he finally moves it.

[6.5]
 




 I have to disagree. If Harry was under the cloak, there was no way Albus could have seen him. He had to have used some other form of detection, or perhaps... WOW. 

TBC in a new thread in the great hall.
 




 Where is the one from CoS when Harry passes the note to Ron in class, Ron reads it *"We should do it tonight."* and gulps, then agrees? 




  He shows us in the first book that he can even follow Harry under his invisibility cloak

I don't remember this, could you please elaborate? 




 An old hillbilly farmer had a wife who nagged him unmercifully. From morning till night (and sometimes later), she was always complaining about something. The only time he got any relief was when he was out plowing with his old mule. He tried to plow a lot.
One day, when he was out plowing, his wife brought him lunch in the field. He drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat his lunch. Immediately, his wife began haranguing him again. Complain, nag, nag; it just went on and on.
All of a sudden, the old mule lashed out with both hind feet; caught her smack in the back of the head. Killed her dead on the spot.
At the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather odd. When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen for a minute, then nod his head in agreement; but when a man mourner approached him, he would listen for a minute, then shake his head in disagreement. This was so consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it.
So after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him why he nodded his head and agreed with the women, but always shook his head and disagreed with all the men. The old farmer said: "Well, the women would come up and say something about how nice my wife looked, or how pretty her dress was, so I'd nod my head in agreement."
"And what about the men?" the minister asked. "They wanted to know if the mule was for sale." 




 The Greater Good, it's when Albus, Aberforth, and Gellart duel. Very well done short film. 




 I would imagine Ron did get a look at it in HBP. 




 Correct. The ministry was conducting raids looking for dark objects, and Lucy thought he could get two birds stoned at once by planting the diary on Arthur Weasley's (who was overseeing the raids) daughter to incriminate them both. 




 Well, since you have to murder someone to make a horcrux, I would say that they are very, very bad. 




 Shit man, since no one else is saying it, *levicorpus* was not a commonly known spell to children of Potter's age. It was created by Snape, and went in and out of fashion, but not a commonly known spell that parents would teach their children... *colloportus* is a spell to lock doors, the reverse of *alohamora.* 




 Say person x takes the vow and promises something to person y. Person y dies, I believe that person x is free of the commitment. 




 Does it have to be Harry's timeline? If not I would go with Lupin. 




 Yea, it's probably my favorite fic. 




 By the time I made it to jr high, they had the stirrups that were sewn into the sock, and were just lines up your leg.
 




 Take the file to a copy place.
 




 I watched that fiasco from the couch, but what a great time. Now all the Minor league managers are doing it.
 




 Nah, they don't employ Burns security anymore. 




 Yea man, the movie is flowing along so nicely, and then it's Saturday morning all over again. I think they would have done better with just the actors and the same dialog in the book. 




 That's an interesting theory. Perhaps why he was proud of his Prince side because Eileen drove him to be what he was. Or was he proud of his Prince side as an adult? 




 You are spot on with that timeline. 




 No shit. I probably saw over 400 games there, and I completely hated that stadium. I saw from Johnny Bench night in 81 through 4,192 through the 90 wire to wire. Probably saw 40 games that year, I got in free as a teen because my buddies dad was the head of security. All the way to the beginning of the remodel.
 




 I wore stirrups when I played in the early 80s. Nothing like the classic unis. 




 I don't remember reading that. 




 How long between the relaying of the prophecy until he went to Dumbledore is the question.
 









 I don't think so. Remember he only switched sides after he heard the prophecy which was a month or so before Riddle's first downfall. 




 He's shown to be an 'expert'  fourteen years later in OotP when Harry was 15. To me that's plenty of time to hone his craft. 




 A well thought out response. Have an upvote.

I completely forgot about Slughorn.
 




 I was thinking that after Snape came to Dumbledore asking him to hide the Potters, and giving anything in return Albus set plans in motion knowing that Sev would be the perfect spy, and taught him himself. 




 How do you suppose he became such a great occlumens? Did Albus teach him knowing that there would eventually be a need for it because he knew so much of Tom Riddle, and that he was a skilled legillimens? 




 Maybe by themselves in a separate animated film. I personally thought that bit included in DH was bad. 




 Yes, Sirius said that he and James used to communicate with the mirrors. 




 "The map never lies!" 




 Voldemort 




 I masturbate. 









 The museum of meeting everyone I've ever loved, and or admired as a real person. 









 I agree.
 




 I will be there the first week of August.
