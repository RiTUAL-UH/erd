 Worth mentioning (because I messed this up once):  Glengarry Glenross is also a '90s movie.

 I've been playing Magic, off and on, for almost 20 years now - in Colorado, Florida, and a few times since moving to Madison.  PM if you're still looking for more folks to have a discussion. 




 Yeah, there's a sweet article on the site that Brandon Perna writes for, suggesting that we will let Moore walk and try Kayvon at the FS position in training camp to see if it fits.  Obviously, there is some risk that it won't,  but Kayvon is squarely buried at 4th CB on the depth chart, and he has some serious talent (he's just playing behind two of the best in the NFL, plus a rookie who made an impact - not easy to do at the CB position).  This way, he gets to compete for playing time elsewhere, and if it doesn't work out, he goes back to CB depth.

Seems like a great move to me. 




 A duck walks into a liquor store and asks the teller, "Hey, man - you got any corn?"

The clerks says, "No, sorry Duck, we don't sell corn here."  So the duck thanks the clerk and leaves.

The next day, the same duck comes into the same liquor store and once again asks for some corn.  Again, the teller politely informs him that they do not sell corn at the liquor store.  He is a little agitated, though.

The day after that, the duck returns.  And once again, he asks the clerk, "You got any corn?".  This time, the clerk loses it:  "No, you stupid duck - I already told you twice that we don't sell corn here.  This is a liquor store!  If you come in here and ask for corn again, I am going to nail your goddamn feet to the floor!"

So the duck leaves.

Then, the next day, the duck returns, walks up to the clerk, and asks, "You got any nails?".  The clerk says, "No." So the duck says, "Well, then you got any corn?"

 It is a coaching musical chairs!

(Shanny lost) 




 They were more mediocre than "bad" - Phillips was 16-16 as our head coach (16-17 if you count the playoff loss to the LA Raiders).  Really, the best thing you can say about that period was that Phillips was a clear caretaker until Shanny was wiling to take the HC job. 




 Exactly!  We're probably less than 25 years away from the ability to do basically anything shown in that movie.

You get your baby checked for genetic abnormalities, give the envelope to a friend, and then he/she goes about planning the party!  Everyone gathers around, you open up a box, and out flies five balloons with the following words written on them:

 Wow, the uphill battle for the playoffs gets . . . uphillier?

Isn't this the actual worst player on the team to lose to injury right now?   




 This is a very solid hire for a number of reasons, many of which are mentioned in other comments (Von and Ware being great OLB in the 3-4, Pot Roast being a prototypical NT, etc), but one that I think is going overlooked is the benefit that this will have on the running game.

The zone-blocking running game is very strong, but it can have some issues with the 3-4, due to the difficulty in communicating assignments and just the spacing of the players.  If the Broncos get to practice against the 3-4 themselves, all the time, we may see better performance against these defenses. 




 Copy-Pasting my response from a previous, similar question.  

I'm going to give my try at this, too.  I love Nate Silver and read his piece when it came out, so I will stay with London, Toronto, Mexico City, and Los Angeles as the expansion cities.

I think that the best way to actually add new teams isn't to stir up everything as much as possible to make "geographic sense", but to make small tweaks while preserving age-old rivalries.  Hence, I will be working with two Conferences (AFC and NFC; if you want to change the "National Football Conference" to the "International Football Conference" that would be fine, too, but I'll keep them the Same.

**American Football Conference**

 East |  Central |  West
------------|--------------|-------------
New England | Pittsburgh | Denver
Miami | Cleveland | Kansas City
New York Jets | Cincinnati | Oakland
Buffalo | Indianapolis | San Diego
Jacksonville | Tennessee | Houston
Toronto | Baltimore | Mexico City

and

**National Football Conference**

East | Central | West 
----------|-----------------|-----------------
Dallas | Green Bay | San Francisco
Philadelphia | Chicago | Seattle
Washington | Minnesota | Arizona
New York Giants | Detroit | St. Louis
Carolina | Tampa Bay | New Orleans
London | Atlanta | Los Angeles


For the most part, I like this re-alignment.  I am a little pissed that New Orleans has to be in the NFC West, and that Atlanta and Tampa moved to the Central, but there are just SO MANY east coast teams that some of them had to go somewhere.  I was basically able to keep every East, West, and North division together, then got to sprinkle in members of the South with new teams where they made (at least some) sense. This is *kind of* disrespectful to the AFC and NFC South, but frankly if you were to choose a division in each conference to break up, these are the most recently created, and harm historical rivalries the least.  Indy/Tennessee and Tampa Bay/Atlanta get to bring a buddy with them, but the Saints, Panthers, Texans, and Jaguars are not so lucky.  But, except for the Saints, these are all relatively recent expansion teams, so it seams like the way to do the least harm.

So, there's my two cents:  we preserve the most storied rivalries, add two new teams to each conference in geographically sound divisions, and are even fairly immune to moves by the Rams, Raiders, or Chargers (i.e., the geography still makes sense if they go to LA, San Antonio, etc).

As for the schedule - we bump it up to 20 weeks with two bye weeks and two preseason games (so, 22 game-weeks, vs. the 21 we have now).  The byes can either be strategically placed to allow teams to travel internationally / play on Thursday, *or* can be set up so that each team gets a bye in the first half and second half of the year.  

The scheduling would be very similar to what we do now, but there is a tweak which I think is very cool:  10 games against your division (home   home, obv), 6 games against a complete division (on yearly rotation, as now), and 2 games against those in your conference who finish at a similar ranking as you (so, 1st plays 1st, 2nd plays 2nd, etc - just like now).  This guarantees that you will play every team on a 5-year rotation, but offers up this little tweak:  on the years where you play a division in your own conference, you play *twice* against one team (the team that finished at the same place), which would be a home-and-home type of series between non-divisional opponents, which I think is awesome.

Camps can start a little earlier to allow for joint practice sessions and/or additional talent evaluation.  Because 12/36 playoff teams is equal to the percentage of teams that currently make the playoffs in baseball (with the WC play-in game it is now 10/30, the same ratio), you could choose to keep it to 12 teams, or you could bump it up to 14, where the top seed in each conference gets a bye.  I am also a fan of moving towards a seeded bracket with no regard for conference, but that is a different discussion.  

No Thursday night games unless both teams are coming off of a bye!  Late in the season (after College Football's regular season is done), you can schedule two games on Saturday to highlight additional playoff-potential games.  These could be scheduled in advance with the opportunity to flex, as the Sunday night games are now.

Thoughts?

tl;dr - Keep West/East/North largely intact, sprinkle members of the South and new teams throughout those.  Go to 20 weeks (18 games), and possibly add two more playoff teams.

 Didn't know too much about this cat, so I did some of my own research in to his career over the past decade or so.  I have organized my analysis in to a table of Special Teams DVOA ranking for each of the past 8 years, both for DeCamillis' team (Chicago, Dallas, or Jacksonville;  I have decided not to go back to his 12-year stint with the Falcons), and the Broncos team (at the time).



Year | Joe DeC.'s Team | Joe De.C's Rank | Broncos Rank
---|---|----|----
2014 | CHI |25th | 27th
2012 | DAL | 15th | 13th
2011 | DAL | 25th| 18th
2010 | DAL | 15th | 27th
2009 | DAL | 14th | 18th
2008 | JAX | 21st | 31st
2007 | JAX | 14th | 28th


As I said before, this is football outsiders DVOA for special teams, which attempts to measure how many points the five areas of special teams add to (or take away from), to a team's point total, on average.  The five areas are kickoffs, punts, kick returns, punt returns, and FG/ Extra points.  In general, it is about a 50/50 split of teams with positive ratings and negative ratings, due to this being based on league average (although a huge outlier can throw this off by a bit).

Anyway, what should jump out to you first is that the Broncos have been absolutely awful at special teams for the better part of a decade.  Only once were we even above the league average! (2012).  Most of the time we are squarely mired in the bottom quarter of the league, which is just embarassing.

Comparatively, I would say that DeCamillis' teams have performed *slightly* better - most years he is right aroudn average, if not slightly above average (so, 14th or 15th), but there are years where his squad performs below league average, with the 25th ranked squards in 2014 and 2011.  It is troubling that his two worst-performing jobs have occurred in the last three campaigns.

Overall, it is hard to sugar-coat this one.  This is an average Special Teams coordinator, who appears to have a few off seasons every now and then, the last of which likely led to his firing from the Bears.  However, that being said, it would be hard to argue that this is not an improvement (albeit a slight improvement) over what the Broncos have achieved in the recent past.

This is a textbook C+ type of move, and it will likely result in a middling special teams next year (and beyond, perhaps).  The thing is, with the talent across the rest of the roster, this may be all that John Elway and Kubiak want - a special teams that doesn't cost the team points.  DeCamillis may be a good coach to deliver just that, all while we allow above-average offense and defense to do the real work.

In addition, it worth noting that this was one of the guys that had the roof of Dallas' practice facility fall on him, which resulted in a severe injury to his neck (he had to have vertebrae fused, I believe).  Regardless, he was back on the field less than two weeks after the surgery in a neck brace with his usual rowdy behavior.  I mention this because he could definitely be the kind of guy that will provide that "kicking and screaming" mentality that has been missing.

tl;dr - Average guy - but maybe that's all the Broncos want.

edit: in the interest of fairness, if you go all the way back to his 10-year stint with the Atlanta Falcons (1997-2006), those teams averaged out at ranking 7th in the league (so, top quarter).  That was a while ago, though, so take that information as you see fit.  

 




 He was 100% a caretaker head coach, when Bowlen had to decide on an Elway vs. Reeves ultimatum.  He was actually fine as a head coach (.500 winning percentage over 2 seasons, plus one playoff loss), but he was always hired with the idea of holding the position until Shanahan was ready to leave San Francisco.

And yes, he was a worse HC than DC - this was also true at Buffalo and Dallas.  But, wherever he gets to focus on just the defense, he always fields a strong unit. 




 And if he does preside over the ascension of Bortles (Raise them!), I think that should put to bed the whole, "Only had success with Peyton Manning" style of criticism.  I wish him the best of luck, though. 




 Gibbs' zone-blocking scheme (ZBS) can be run with either 1 or 2 backs, with some slight adjustments for when both backs are in there (it adjusts the strongside/weakside designation, and especially alters blocking on the weakside, usually).  But, I think it is important to understand that a FB in the ZBS is not built to go put a hat on a Mike linebacker in the hole every play.  He is more in the Howard Griffith-style of back - can pass protect, can catch balls out of the backfield if needed, and can lead block (sometimes), and even can take those 1-yard plunges from an upback position.  I am not sure if that kind of player is currently on the roster, but I think the closest fit is probably Thompson, as you suggested, although I have not seen very much from him regarding pass protection and catching the ball (at least in the regular season).

edit:  If you want to learn so much about the ZBS that you'll consider quitting your job to go coach it at a local highschool or community college, check [this] (http://vimeo.com/cripes/videos/search:Alex/sort:date/format:thumbnail) out.

 Not a doctor (well, not that kind, anyway), but I think that the nature of Manning's injury was that it really only would heal via rest, and the rest required would have been longer than just the end of the regular season (sort of like Aaron Rodger's calf).  It's possible the options were :  1.  Sit Manning the rest of the year or 2. Play Manning the rest of the year.  No real in between. If 2 or 3 weeks of rest wouldn't actually accomplish anything - then why sit him at all?

Recall, also, that until the Cincinnati Bengals loss, the Broncos were still playing for the #1 seed in the AFC.

 I watched Brian Griese beat out Bubby Brister when Elway left.  People were all, "Wonderlic this" and "Michigan that" and the hype was huge.  And you know what?  He was fine.  He played well sometimes, but generally didn't perform well in the big games (which were almost always against you assholes back then).

I watched Plummer being instilled as the new answer, and I loved Plummer.  "No Mistake Jake" was the mantra around here - as long as he didn't force anything, we would be *fine*!  Even though Shanahan fucked it up, Plummer had a clear ceiling.

And Cutler.  That was probably the biggest hype I have ever seen for a new Broncos quarterback - even Shanahan fell into it, replacing Jake mid-season and easily costing us a playoff spot and Shanahan a job, eventually.  Don't get me started on Orton and Tebow.

These players all looked like they had potential, and I'd argue that only Plummer really put it all together for a strong season.  One strong season.  It is easy to get swept up in the hype, but there are not very many NFL-quality starting quarterbacks in this world.  Hopefully, the Lobster turns into that for us, but you never know.  I think the organization has done everything they can to stack the deck in their favor (having him study under Manning, but still compete for the backup role with various other QBs), and I have seen improvement in preseason play, but who knows? 




 It's wishful thinking.  We all hope that will be the case, but it is obviously completely up in the air.  If I were being honest, I'd say there is a 50% chance that Brock is a completely mediocre, replacement-level type player, a 40% chance that his is an above-average starting quarterback, a 8% chance that is the long-term solution at quarterback, and about a 2% chance that he ascends to the mysterious level of "elite".

You think I am being too optimistic? (honest question) 




 This logic is faultless.

**Faultless, I say!!!**

 I would straight-up trade Peyton Manning for the #1 overall pick this year.  It is simply a question of value.  Manning adds a great deal of value to his team, but it will likely only be for another year (if that!).

By contrast, a number 1 pick will add much greater value *over the course of that player/player's career*.  Imagine the Broncos do this, and simply trade back for something reasonable (i.e., not what the Redskins did):  Swap 1sts this year with a team in the high single digits, plus next year's 1st rounder.

So, to recap:  Under this situation, I give up Peyton Manning, and I am left with:  The number 28 pick (Broncos), the 7-9th pick (traded for the #1 overall I received for Manning) this year, plus two more 1sts next year - at least one of which is probably top 15?

I love Manning, but no team would take that trade.  It just bleeds value. 




 Very possible.  Peyton and Gase seem to have a great relationship, and I like the idea of giving a Wunderkind-type coordinator his first shot at HC.

Thing is, that also describes Austin and Quinn (though they are on the other side of the ball, and have not built up the relationship with the Broncos organization).

Then there's Kubiak, who I think gets too much flak for his stint in Houston.  When Schaub was a respectable QB, that Houston team was very good.  It is not easy taking over a franchise which has literally zero history of success and establishing that new culture.

Personally, I think I would be quite pleased with Gase, Quinn, Austin, ot Kubiak, but would prefer Gase (if we go offensive) or Austin (if we go defensive). 




 That movie had such potential.  A very interesting world with a nice sci-fi concept to tie it together.

But, nope.  Bank Robberies for everyone! 




 Broncos have an interview set up for tomorrow with him, and I think that the Falcons have a 2nd interview today.

I hope he makes it to Denver to talk with Elway, at the very least. 




 By Grabthar's Hammer . . . What a savings. 




 You certainly do; there's a reasons that he is one of the only coaches left over from the McDaniels Era - he is very good at coaching running backs.  Studesville truly is a . . . hmm, what word am I looking for here?  I guess, "Pro". 




 I like Redmond because sometimes he plays alongside Barrie and I get to shout, "The Kubrick Pair is D-ing it up!!!" 




 Nah, $41.43 - because real cool dudes use two Twin Primes to make a price! 




 There's always money in the banana stand . . . 




 Maybe if I make a bottom 5 list . . . 




 Stream open; over-reactions to minor statements ready! 




 I got to thinking about this when everyone and their dog seemed to have an opinion on how good Fox really is, both here and in /r/nfl.  So, where, in your estimation, does John Fox rank among the other great coaches that have been at the helm of the Broncos?  Is he top 5, or somewhere below that?

I think Shanahan is heads-and-shoulders above the rest.  I know he looked iffy without Elway at QB, and that his teams would fade at the end of the season and always have trouble fielding a reasonable defense, but he coached at an elite level for a brief period, and was very good for most of the rest.  Easy #1.

I think the second spot has to go to Dan Reeves.  I know we lost three Superbowls and an AFC Championship game during his tenure.  I know he was far too conservative with Elway in his prime (a direct contrast to Shula with Marino), but the man won so many games, and had the Broncos competing for championships many times.  I don't think that can be overlooked.  Easy #2.

Now here's where it gets hard:  who is number 3:  John Fox or Red Miller?  I think they are the most comparable of the remaining coaches, and have had very similar success (Fox is .719, Miller .645; both have a single AFC Championship, both righted the ship when they arrived).  For my money, though, I am going to put Red Miller here.  He very deservedly won Coach of the Year in '77, and was really the first coach to establish the Broncos as a legitimate franchise.  It was amazing what he accomplished in that first year with Craig Morton at the helm, although the importance of the Orange Crush defense cannot be overstated.  By contrast, I think Fox benefited greatly from a miracle run by Tim Tebow , that Broncos defense, and amazing kicking from Prater (all of which was completely unsustainable), and then working with Peyton Manning.  I don't think Fox would have been successful taking over the '77 team, but I do think that Miller would have been fine taking over after McDaniels.

And, finally, to round out the top 5, I present the only other coach to have a winning record while coaching the Denver Broncos:  John Ralston (who went 34-33-3 over five years).  These Broncos teams were not good, but somehow Ralston was able to remain competitive regardless (Floyd Little helped, I'd imagine). He barely ekes out Wade Phillips due to longevity, a slightly better overall record, and the quality of talent available to him.

So, That leaves my list as:

1. Mike Shanahan
2. Dan Reeves
3. Red Miller
4. John Fox
5. Jon Ralston

Hon. Mention:  Wade Phillips (a much better DC than head coach, he still went exactly .500 in his career with Denver, and led us to a playoff appearance - which Ralston never did).

 




 I said this in jest to my wife last night (we're both UF alums who were there for both of his Gator Championships).  It really isn't *that* crazy of an idea, but I am pretty sure that he wants to build an entire program and have full control with recruiting and what not.  The college game is just so different, and now with the playoff system it is easier for an always-solid team to have a shot at the championship game most years (without a playoff system, the Buckeyes wouldn't have had a chance this year).  I also think he likes shifting the power away from the SEC, and he's doing very well in that regard. 




 Good call.  Fucked up all the way through, but eye stuff gets me especially.

 This is exactly it; he is average.  There was a piece (I think on Grantland) at the beginning of the year ranking coaches based on a survey sent to football people.  Fox was squarely in the second group - above average, not elite.

So, what is he good at?  I think the players like playing for him.  I think he handles the media well.  I think he has reasonable game plans (or at least trusts his coordinators to make decisions) - but nothing special.  He's not great at adjustments.  Awful at motivating players.  Absolutely awful at situational decisions (4th downs, being aggressive at end of halves, using time outs. **challenges!!!**)

He is an average coach, maybe slightly above average.  His ceiling is not very far from his floor, and he is certainly a stabilizing force.  This was precisely what the 4-12 Broncos needed after the McDaniels fiasco.  Now, with a strong core of players built over the last few years through strong drafts and key free agents (not just the big names, but folk like Chris Harris Jr. and CJ Anderson - both UFA), the ceiling on this team is high, and I think Fox's style conflicts with what this team can accomplish. 




 It is definitely a thing on all the Broncos blogs.  And we didn't even make it up - the Panthers did.  Ask the Panthers fans. 




 I think this is *a little* over-stated.  In my estimation, if you don't *play for* the Superbowl each season, it is a failure (meaning, reach the AFC Championship game, so you have a chance).  I mean, come on, anything can happen in a big playoff game like that - you just want your shot at the Superbowl.  The Broncos didn't even get that 3 of his 4 years (lost in divisional round @ NE, vs. BAL, vs. IND., which I think was a big part of this. 




 Correct.  And you don't exactly say to the Ravens, "Oh, I am waiting to see if the Broncos fire their coach which just won the division championship for his first four year before I decide if I want to OC for you guys!"   




 And yet, both coaches that you are referring to have developed a style so reviled that it inspires the creation of "insert name-ball".

Coincidence?  I think not.  There's no Carrolball or Belliball or even a Tomlinball. 




 This is really great!  As an assist for people to see what is going on under the hood (or, in essence, why you did each calculation), they can "follow along" with [this pdf] (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-4/fips-180-4.pdf). 




 Thank you for the stats!

You are certainly correct - but I think the Colts were still just daring Manning to make the throws.  As your stats show, this year he has been above-average in making those throws.  I think it is fair to say that yesterday he was below average making those throws (and they *were* there, in that sequence where multiple throws went to Sanders, he had beat his man by at least a step).  Results?  Overthrow by 2 yards and overthrow by 0.5 yards. 




 Usually the head coach is made available to the media as well (recall last year when Fox and Elway had a presser after the Superbowl).  This tweet is suggesting that that omission means the Fox will be fired. 




 It was mentioned in his SI piece last week. 




 I do agree with you in principle, but there were opportunities to win the game.  You don't deserve the down votes! 




 This was an absolute choke job.  Only CJ Anderson showed up today.  Poor showings from the wide receivers, Peyton Manning, and much of the defense, especially on critical third downs.  Talib may have had his worst game as a Bronco.  Demaryius looked spooked most of the time.  The Colts decided to be physical 1-on-1 with receivers and we had zero answers.  This looked eerily similar to the Superbowl at times, and the Colts D is not the Seahawks D.  Disappointing.

This is now twice in three years that Fox and company have squandered a first round bye by losing to an underdog.  And the other year they were out-coached in the Superbowl and embarrassed.  I'd guess that people will be clamoring for Fox's job - but there aren't really reasonable alternatives in mind.  Staying pat for at least another year would be the best move; 4 division titles in 4 years is still an achievement to be proud of.

Good season, Broncos.  Always looking forward to next year, but this one leaves a nasty taste . . . 




 How close were we to kicking Tom Brady out of this game?  Holy shit  




 Interesting design - but I must say that I am a a little surprised that it is an open-air stadium.  It seems to me that all the owners who are a building new digs want to be able to host a Superbowl there in the near future, and I think the league would hesitate to have one in St. Louis in February.

Now, I know that New Jersey just had one, and I am actually supportive of the idea of having cold-weather Superbowls (Denver would be great - you could easily have a 50 degree, sunny day or -10 and a blizzard!), but I think it is folly to assume that because NJ had one, that this issue doesn't stick in the craws of some. 




 Amazon Prime has it.  Just in case you already have that thing. 




 Not only that - but did you read the article?  Very, very poor writing.  If I see another one-sentence paragraph which is completely related to the previous and next one-sentence paragraphs, then I will not be held accountable for my actions. 




 My day-to-day sanity has greatly improved since unsubbing from /r/politics and /r/atheism.

 




 Very, very sad.  Apparently he can't remember the Superbowl victories anymore. 




 It is amazing to me to think that Chris Harris Jr. was almost not given a chance in the NFL.  You can be aggressive and call him the best cornerback in football, or at least have him in the top 5, but I think everyone who follows football would put him in the top 10.

So, think of this:  how many players who are one of the top 10 at their position *almost didn't get any college free agent offers*?  That's amazing.

And then, to suffer one of these non-contact ligament injuries and recover so quickly?  The Broncos underpaid for Mr. Harris Jr. - He is something really special. 




 Lotsa people arguing about looks and pretty and girl next door and what not.

But when she sings, "Two bottle of whiskey for the way.  And I sure would like some sweet company, and I'm leaving tomorrow, what'd'ya say?" I have only one question:

What.  Fucking. Train? 




 I'll look for it in earnest tomorrow.

Also, obviously Tebow was a rollercoaster for everyone involved.  You know we lost 7-3 against the Chiefs **at home** the week before various miracles won us that WC game?  That's just not a healthy way to live . . . 




 You ever see the article/gif explaining how something like 4 defensive players completely shit the bed on that play, simultaneously?  Was hilarious.

Go Tebow.

Edit:  Oh, and Bubby Brister can't field a shotgun snap in the playoffs, bit he's good enough to backup Elway.

Edit 2:  But not good enough to beat out Brian Griese for a job. 




 So hard. 




 AFC West plays AFC North next year.  So he's at least good for a 90-yard run against the Steelers. 




 Good luck, buddy. I would seriously consider switching fandom if my team picked him #1. 




 If I walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, would you call it a duck?

Similar thing going on here.  Some people are very willing to call "duck", and some think there isn't enough information available. 




 Here's a game:  I'll set the Over/Under on Career Playoff wins for Manziel at 0.5.

Whatcha want? 




 Elway is so good. 




 I'm sure they'll have plenty more opportunities to look the other way. 




 Exactly!  You have to make sure you mispronounce it in some way which vaguely suggests that you are subconsciously harboring some deep-seeded racism.

We also would accept, "Scrong", "Stronk", and "Scarong".  




 Good work, this is how one answers a direct question.

Now go fuck yourself you dirty Patriot fan.

 Here's something that I am looking at for this game:  Red Zone efficiency.

The Seattle defense is at the top of many statistical categories, but one in which they are deficient is opponent touchdown percentage in red zone.  [Here] (http://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/opponent-red-zone-scoring-pct) you can see that the Seahawks are 26th in the league here (granted, the Panthers are worse, but that isn't the point).  IF the Panthers can convert red zone opportunities into touchdowns, instead of field goals, they have a very good chance.  I mean, this is kind of one of those obvious coach-speak cliches, but I bring it up because it seems to me that the greatest weakness of the Seattle Defense is in this portion of the field - so you need to take advantage of that to beat them. 




 I think I would put a lot of money on this game being closer than at least one game this weekend.  This is just someone looking at the point spread / records, glorifying the Seahawks (particularly their offense, which is situationally good, at best), and moving on to the other, more "interesting" games.

 




 We're going to need some more of this come Saturday.

Here's an interesting question:  who has more rushing yards at the end of the game:  Stewart or Lynch? 




 I remember jumping out of my seat from that hit, scaring the shit out of the cat.

 




 I've got the Carolina Panthers covered.

Since my wife is from Charlotte, and still has family there, we went to the game two years ago when the Broncos were in town (we planned on being there for the long Veteran's day weekend anyway, and completely lucked into the game being the same weekend).  So, it was me, in my Von Miller orange jersey, my wife in some normal Broncos shirt covered by her coat, and her father in normal, non-affiliated clothes.  We started off in a Broncos tailgate where the guys in charge were home-brewers and offered us tastes of all of their beers, which was awesome.  We got a little light razzing a couple of times outside of the stadium, but nothing too serious (this was the year before the Panthers won the division, and Cam was struggling). 

Even once we sat down and the game started, everyone was really, really nice.  I was slightly obnoxious as Von sacked Cam 1-on-1 from a "spy" position, stuffed him for losses on QB-keepers, but no one really cared.  In fact, as Cam continued to struggle, there were many cries of, "Scam Newton!" and the like.  Overall, we ran away with the game, but nothing was ever heated at all.  I even high-fived a dude when De'angelo Williams scored a touchdown because we both had him in fantasy!  Very cool people.  My experience at this game, coupled with my recurring visits to Charlotte have led to my adoption of the Panthers as my NFC team.  Needless to say, I am a huge Panthers fan this weekend.  Obviously, should the Panthers meet the Broncos in the Superbowl, my allegiances will lie with our shade of blue.  But, there is no team I'd rather lose to more than the Panthers this year.

 




 Ice Bowl will be on after that! 




 It  is on again next (right now is Cowboys vs Packers NFC Championship game before superbowl XXX)!

 




 No need to buy it - just mine a bunch at the very beginning when you could mine on CPU/GPUs.
