 was responding from my phone while interacting with 'snooty people'... but, also, just how i interpreted your reply.

moving on, biochar isn't biocharcoal....   check out the Rice U study linked to at the bottom of the sidebar.  Biochar is, or should be at least, just 'char'... carbon.   the VOC's cooked out.  

They're just two different things.  (bio)char is the structure... 'coal' is/are the VOC's intermixed within the structure of the 'char'.

you don't want these in there anyway.   higher temperatures 'cook' these out, increase the porosity of the char, activate the char to a greater extent, make the char stronger (weaker C-C bonds are broken and the carbon leaves with the rest of the gases) ... etc.

in the end, you end up with either a very porous material... that is virtually 'empty' and that needs to be 'charged' before application to the soil... ....or, some 'charcoal-like', much-less-porous, gob of lower quality char that .... is still very unlikely to catch on fire... ...but, contains enough VOCs to 'repel' nutrients, microbes, fungi, and plant roots away from it until it eventually breaks down.

Still don't think it'd catch on fire.  That thought relative to it just implies to me that you should maybe to a little more reading up on it before trying to use it.  

That said, to answer your question... 'to not *burn*'? ... probably as much as you want.   but, for proper growth? ... you don't really want to exceed 33%.  Some were going as high as 50% biochar... or, mixing biochar with compost 50% per volume ... but, they'd (presumably) let it age for a while... giving the nutrients and microbes and such in the compost a change to 'load the char' before applying it to the soil or trying to grow in it.

but, from most of my reading ... and in my experience... 33% is really the most you'd really want to apply... and, positive results can be seen at below 5%.   i.m.o.   10-25% is the sweet spot.  the longer you have to let it 'age' mixed in with compost, the higher you can go.

but, I'd imagine you'd have to work pretty hard to get it to *burn* ... after the initial cool-down period during the char production anyway. 




 ...and I might've heard a rumor that biochar isn't charcoal... hence the lack of the word 'coal' in its name.

You may want to read the Wikipedia on it...link in the sidebar 




 if you're going for that size, [biochar kilns](http://bestbiocharkiln.com/) are probably your best route ... over 55 gallon drums. 

I'd imagine you could try making one yourself... be it an above-ground one, or lining a hole with one... ...I believe the critical variable to it is the angle of the sides.  just scale it properly... ....and, though I've never tried it, I'd imagine you could build a pretty large-scale one to speed things up.

the barrel designs are a hassle, imo. I've made probably 15 different barrel things over the years and... they're just a hassle when it's said   done.  but that's just my opinion.  




 For starters, ash and biochar are two totally different things. 

separately, you can definitely use too much ash.. it'll throw off the pH of your soil.   but, I've been able to add pretty liberal amounts to compost piles that I'm in no rush to use any time soon and... i tall work out alright.   but, honestly, there are 'better' ways to get minerals into your compost/soil than ash.   




 why would it catch fire??

 it changes things a little more than just those .... water flow-rates, disruption of natural habitats, temperature, mating seasons/cycles, the way the river flows (not just the rate).. the change in silt alters landscapes, etc

there's definitely an ecological impact.  I'm not entirely arguing *against* them because of this, just saying that there is definitely a footprint due to them.

Dams also release CO2 due to the changes in the ecosystems, as well alter the way the ecosystems are capable of removing co2 due to the changes in habitat 

but, we need somewhere to bottle up that water, and getting juice from it in the process is a benefit ... so, fuck it.  




  They ecologically devastating to the river and basin they occupy, but that's about it.

applying the logic of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q) ... adapting it to hydro from wolves....   could create some pretty not-too-far-fetched theories about how more than just the immediate environment is altered due to hydro.


i mean, think about a dam 200 miles upstream blocking/holding-back water such as to create a lake.    but also allowing less water downstream in the process.... ...in such that the river literally gets smaller/narrower/shallower because of it...

would not the ecosystem downstream be altered?   and, the surrounding ecosystems that tie into it as well?


I'm not arguing for or against [hydroelectric](/r/hydroelectric) ... nor am i saying that it can't be done in more sustainable ways ... but, to say that its impacts are purely local seems a bit .... ~~naive~~ narrow in scope


edit 1: the ~~strikethrough~~ above

edit 2: to [add a link](https://strangebehaviors.wordpress.com/2014/03/10/maybe-wolves-dont-change-rivers-after-all/) that contradicts the video I'm providing as an example  ... but, only with intentions of taking a less polarized position on it and to try to look of it more objectively
