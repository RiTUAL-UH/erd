 Some questions you need to ask yourself:

* Is there anything your employer could do for you to convince you to stay? More money? More time off? A promotion?
* Can you survive on your husband's salary for an extended period of time?
* If you quit, what kind of job would you look to get?

Either way, you probably need a break. I've had jobs that made me physically sick to come to work in the morning. That's not good for anyone. 









 Why would you be sad? IO had the second highest opening weekend of any Pixar movie and, when all is said and done, will likely be the second highest domestic gross after Toy Story 3. 

It's a fine movie. A lot of people went to see it and it made a lot of money. 

It just ran into the JW buzzsaw. No way you could plan for that. 




 If there's anything we NY Mets fans know about, it's suffering and sadness. 




 97% of the K-3 teaching staff in the United States are women. If there was an important job that was gender skewed the other way, people would be out in the streets with torches and pitchforks.  




 I'm not a fan of the TPP, but realize that all he's done is get authority to negotiate an agreement and get an up or down vote from Congress. We don't know what's in the agreement because there is no agreement. It's still being negotiated. 

 All we've got so far is a bunch of leaked bits and pieces of various proposed parts of it from people who, quite frankly, have their own agendas. 




 For me, there's no discussion technology that can beat mid to late 90's Usenet. 

I paid for a Usenet account because my company's feed was occasionally unreliable and it allowed me to comment without putting my institution in the header. Plus I could read at home and at work and mostly stay current by remembering where I left off.

I was working the overnights in those days, so I had plenty of time to waste. 




 Yeah, my account is only mid six digits. I read /. for some time before signing up for an account. 

I still have it in my RSS feed because there are decent links posted and I can scroll through them quickly enough in Feedly, but I haven't commented there or even been interested in the comments in some time. 




 Just note, as an exempt employee, they still have to pay you if you run out of leave time.  




 Yes, something like this. 

You like working where you are, but you felt it was time to move on because you wanted to advance in your career and take on new challenges, but you were blocked by your boss, so you had to seek an opportunity outside the company.

Tell them you have an offer on the table with a raise and a promotion, but now that you found your boss will be leaving, you're interested in his job. 

I wouldn't pussyfoot around. Walk right into your boss's boss's office and lay it on the table. You're under time pressure and you need an answer ASAP.

Some things to consider:

1) You're going to have to replace yourself if you take your boss's job. If it's hard to find good workers where you are, this may end up being an issue going forward.

2) You may burn bridges with the company whose offer you're turning down. 

3) There may be resentment from your current company. This is not unusual when people get counter-offers to stay in their current job. Since you're hoping to be promoted to be able to stay, it may be less of an issue.

Good luck. 




 In the US, a company can make whatever rules they like for sick/vacation time. 




 How big is the company. They may not be able to move fast enough to give you the job before your new job starts.

Also, this kind of ultimatum often ends badly. 




 Short answer, yes.

Get your resume together and start sending it out.

 You're The Worst. It's almost an anti-romcom. 

And if you like that, try Catastrophe, currently on Amazon Prime Video. 




 Well, maybe that's how you see it, but that's certainly not clear from the rule's origin. Here's the comic from whence the Bechdel test springs

http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Rule-cleaned-up.jpg

The woman who explains the rule in this comic says it's rule that she won't go see a movie unless it passes this test. That has nothing to do with statistical analysis. It seems like a pretty hard and fast definition of the bar a movie has to pass to be acceptable to her to watch it.

 














 A lot of people who shouldn't be exempt will be moved to hourly positions, perhaps with a pay cut to cover some of the OT. 

Federal minimum wage is $7.25/hr. That's $15K/year. It's ridiculous that there are people making $24K as an exempt employee. 




 If retailers are relying on exempt employees to do that much of their work, stocking shelves or ringing up customers, then they're already in violation of the FLSA. 

Exempt employees are supposed to spend the lion's share of their work day performing managerial duties. If they're mostly doing the same work as clerks or cashiers or cleaners or other associates, with only a few managerial duties,  then they're not eligible to be exempt from from overtime rules. 




 By the way, here's the fact sheet with the proposed rule changes.

http://www.dol.gov/whd/overtime/NPRM2015/factsheet.htm

The proposal is to set the new exempt minimum at the 40th percentile of weekly wages and index it yearly. Right now that would be $921 per week, or $47,892 annually.

I expect a lot of lower-level exempt employees will be converted to hourly. A lot of these employees are probably not really qualified to be exempt anyway, based on the duties test. They're just given sham manager titles, even though most of their work is the same work done by hourly workers.  




 Right. 

Assuming this rule goes into effect, if you make $40,000 a year now and are exempt, next year your company will either have to convert you to hourly (OT eligible) or raise your pay. 









 No, that's not how it works.

Your employer has to decide whether to classify you as hourly or exempt. If they want to classify you as exempt, they they have to meet a bunch of criteria based on your job duties and also pay you at least the minimum salary for an exempt worker. 

If you're an hourly worker, you must get paid for every hour you work at your hourly rate up to 40 hours per week and 1.5 times your hourly rate for all time worked over 40 hours. This is true no matter how much you work and how much you earn. I'm an hourly worker and I make much more than the current or proposed exempt minimum.

Your employer can't cap your pay by switching you to exempt if you make more than the exempt minimum by working OT. If you're hourly, you must be paid hourly. If they want to switch you to exempt status, they have to reclassify your job and treat you as exempt from that point on, no matter how much you work. They can't switch you back and forth willy nilly.

Edit:
My first gilding! Thank you, kind sir. 




 The short answer is yes. 

You can make a lot more money as an hourly worker working a lot of OT than an exempt worker who makes a higher base wage but works a lot of unpaid OT. A lot of employers classify their workers as exempt for this very reason. 




 Are there people who don't like this movie?

A lot of Bay's and Cage's work over the years has been...not good, but this film is pretty much a perfect exemplar of their particular strengths. Just a fun action flick with snappy dialogue, good humor and some very nice action set pieces before the availability of CGI ruined everything.  




 To be eligible to be exempt from overtime rules, your job must fit into one of the categories of jobs that are exempt from overtime. Moreover, most of your work time must be spent doing those duties. You can't just call someone a manager, for example, and have them spend most of their day stocking shelves, ringing up customers and doing inventory and then classify them as exempt. 

As a journalist, you might fit into the creative professional exemption. There's actually some case law directly on point here. Here's a DOL paper about journalists.

http://www.dol.gov/whd/overtime/fs17q_journalists.pdf

Relying upon federal case law, the final regulations clarify that employees of newspapers, magazines, television and other media are not exempt creative professionals if they only collect, organize and record information that is routine or already public, or if they do not contribute a unique interpretation or analysis to a news product.  

On top of this, you must be paid a minimum salary to qualify as and exempt employee. The current minimum is $455 a week, which has not gone up since 2004. The proposal sets the new exempt minimum at $970 per week. You must still have a job that qualifies for the exemption.  




 They're probably doing the old fake cashier's check scam. Craigslist is a haven for that sort of thing.

They will ask you to buy something on your credit card and send you a certified check for the amount plus your salary. Then a couple weeks later, your bank will find out the check is fake and demand the money back. Your employer has the items and you're left huge debt and possible criminal charges. 




 No, it's still a federal holiday.  As a private company, they can choose to observe it or not, but don't pretend like they're not screwing their employees out of a day off. 




 You managed to squeeze seven for Jonathan Strange. 




 It's a really fun show. Great romantic chemistry between the two leads combined with some seriously vulgar comedy.

Some caveats:

*  Amazon Prime Video's interface is shit. 
*  Six episodes seems way too short for the amount of story they want to get through. It all seems very rushed and there's no time for the story to slow down so the characters can breathe a bit.
*  The tone is very inconsistent. For a lot of scenes, I'm never quite sure whether it's supposed to be funny or serious or disturbing or what.

Still, it's a great show and well worth watching. Plus, it's only six episodes. You can fit that into a boring, rainy afternoon.
 




 If she was making less than 16,200, she'd qualify.  That's a bit more than minimum wage/full time.

 My Mom died in 2006. My brother transferred her cell phone service to his account and it preserved her outgoing voicemail message.

For a few years afterward I'd hear my Mom's voice when I called him and he didn't pick up. It was weird and creepy, but it was also nice to still hear her voice every once in a while.

The message got cleared a while ago and I miss being able to hear it.

Fuck. 




 I saw this movie in the theater. I liked it a lot back then. Don't know if it would hold up for a re-watch. 

You sure you know how to handle that thing? Yeah, I was on the machine gun club in High School. 









 Got my purple guy today. Wasn't sure about the purple, but it's really rather attractive. It's installing the Android update now.

Thanks to Ting for the great deal and a big Eff U to FedEx  who kept my new toy in their local shipping center for a couple extra days because I didn't pay for next day shipping.  




 I wouldn't worry too much about it. Your boss came to you and asked if you were going to apply and smiled when you said yes. Sounds like you're the one he wants to hire. 

You can certainly ask him about it. He'll tell you if he's not allowed to say. Something along the lines of,"Can you tell me a little about how the interview process works? What kinds of questions do you usually ask?". 

A lot of times, these temp-to-hire interviews are mostly for formality. 

Good luck! 




 English doesn't just borrow from other languages. English follows other languages down dark alleys, knocks them over, and rummages through their pockets for loose grammar. 




  **AVC:** You must have some Oliver Reed stories.

 They often cut stuff out of the versions they show in the US, either for time/commercials or S P reasons. 




 Second half of the first season was much better than the first.  




 Most people who do hiring aren't stupid. If they see an abrupt resignation in you job history, they're going to ask why. And when they call to check on your references, they'll simply ask if you're eligible for re-hire, which you aren't.

Resigning instead of being fired doesn't do much for you in this instance, unfortunately. If you're fires, you still may be able to collect unemployment. 









 I'm interested in this subject, so I've read up on it, but I'm a layman. If you're really interested in pursuing this you should speak with an employment lawyer and a tax professional to see what the upside/downside might be for you.

Good luck. 




 Just to be clear, there's no law that says a 1099 workers should be paid more than a w2 worker for the same work. It's just a general business guideline. An employer is free to pay an independent contractor whatever rate is agreed upon.

On the other hand, if you have been improperly classified as a 1099 worker, the IRS can reach back quite a ways to sanction your employer. The only real benefits for you would be a possible rebate of self-employment tax that you paid to the IRS in those years as well as eligibility for unemployment insurance.

http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses- -Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-Self-Employed-or-Employee 




 First of all, are you really an independent contractor? When you get your paycheck, are income and social security taxes taken out? If so, then you are an employee. If not, then you are an independent contractor.

If it's the latter and you really are a 1099 independent contractor, then you are responsible for paying your own income and FICA/Medicare taxes. You are also responsible for paying the employer's portion of FICA/Medicare. Hopefully you are saving money to pay those taxes.

If you actually are a 1099 contractor, your boss should be paying you extra to make of for the extra tax you have to cover, not to mention not having unemployment or other worker benefits.

The IRS has rules as to who can be classified as an independent contractor. Based on your description of your job duties, you probably should be a w2 employee. You can file a complaint with the IRS and they can make your employer classify you as a w2 worker retroactively. 

Either way, your boss has to pay you for all the time you work,  whether it's at home or at the office or wherever.  She has to pay you time and a half for hours over 40 in a week. The only way she can get out of this is to designate you as Exempt. The IRS has some very strict rules for who can be designated as exempt. At the very minimum you must be paid at least $455 a week to qualify.

Realistically, you're probably better off looking for a new job at this point instead of trying top whip your boss into shape. 




 It's interesting to think about the counterfactuals, but I doubt Al Smith could or would have much of a difference had he been elected president.

In fact, if Smith were elected in '28, we'd almost certainly have had a Republican elected to the Whitehouse in '32, which probably would have been a huge disaster. 




 Yes, Hoover was far from the worst president. There are easily a dozen worse you could name without too much effort. 




 Just create an LLC and transfer domain ownership to it. Put the LLC information in the Whois info.

 There was a biographical movie made about Von Braun called "I Aim At The Stars" that came out in 1960.

 No, this is horseshit that Southern Pride people tell themselves.

Go read the articles of secession.

http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/declarationofcauses.html

Here's Georgia's

For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property, and by the use of their power in the Federal Government have striven to deprive us of an equal enjoyment of the common Territories of the Republic. 

The Confederate States clearly lay out why they are seceding and, in the main, that reason is slavery. Read the actual, historical documents, not the crap southern apologists spout.

  




 We work similar shifts here. 8AM-8PM/8PM-8AM, two on and two off. Luckily, management doesn't care how we rotate, as long as there are the proper number of asses in the seats.

I currently swap back and forth every two months with my opposite number. Some people work all days or all nights and some prefer switching on and off every eight days.

I've worked some version of this shift schedule for the last 26 years and it just seems normal to me now. I like the freedom of being off on weekdays so I can run errands and generally if I need a day for something specific I can swap with someone on the opposite shift.

I am pretty overweight, but I do sit in a chair all day/night.

When we switched to our new facility last year, there some discussion of moving to an 8 hour rotation, but none of us liked that idea very much and we would have had to hire more people. 




 Yeah, I was wondering if it was a mistake or if a lot of people just don't like purple.

 That's why we need a space laser to shoot them down. 














 If this is not the first time they've done this, then it's probably time to get your resume together and start looking.

In you review, you can talk about your desire to move on from your current role and what the time table looks like for that from her perspective. See if you can get some firm commitment with respect to the time interval.

If your manager is someone you can be brutally honest with, then you might talk to her about the fact that if you're going to be blocked from an internal promotion for the foreseeable future, you might have to think about pursuing an external one.  Then the company would lose your services completely. 

But a manager who blocks internal promotions is not likely to be the sort of person you can have that conversation with.

Sometimes you just have to move on if you want to move up, hard as that may be to do. 









 Which one is the real one? Seriously?

Reminds me of a story, which may be apocryphal. In 1985/86 DC Comics had their first, big crossover event, "Crisis On Infinite Earths". The objective of this event, besides selling a shit-ton of comics, was to get rid of all of the various "alternate universe" versions of heroes and villains and simplify some very complex continuity. 

Near the end of the event, one of DC's editors got upset because a book was still being published, or planned to be published, in pre-Crisis continuity, with characters that had been eliminated in the Crisis event. 

"He's writing about characters that don't exist!", said the editor.

Whereupon someone else turned to him and said, "Dude, none of these characters exist." 




 I finally got around to watching the show on Netflix a couple months back. I'll admit, the title put me off it for a while. Punny titles make me think "stupid sitcom". 









 Barristan was killed because his role, running Mereen after Dany flies off on Drogon, was taken by Tyrion/Varys. 

Sansa is with the Boltons because her story in the books, hanging out in the Reach playing politics, is another pointless diversion and certainly not worth wasting screen time on. Putting her in Winterfell moves an interesting character to the heart of the action. 

Jaime is in Dorne because someone had to go there and he needed a reason not to be in King's Landing. His Riverlands story was so compelling that I barely remember any of it.

Its seems to me that a lot of the complainers just don't seem to get the very specific limitations of a TV show versus a book. On TV you can't just keep adding more characters and more plot lines as Martin loves to do. There's only so much screen time and actors cost money. Similarly, you can't just sideline characters for an entire season because you have nothing interesting for them to do, Bran and Rickon not withstanding.

The problem is that books 4 and 5 are a narrative mess and punching them into shape so they could made into coherent television was a difficult task. I could see people being unhappy with the specific decisions of how to do this or that, but it's unarguable and difficult decisions had to be made. 




 Interesting. You know, I thought there would be more. 

It seems like there aren't very many TV shows where the Star Of Morning was actually a regular character. 




 Any day now I'll be able to buy myself a real Tricorder.

 Yes, they do.

After being hired, employers often require their employees to take certain tests as they begin employment or on a periodic basis during their employment, such as physical examinations, fingerprinting and drug testing. Whenever you impose special tests, requirements or conditions that your employee must meet, time he or she spends traveling to and from the tests, waiting for and undergoing these tests, or meeting the requirements is probably hours worked.
