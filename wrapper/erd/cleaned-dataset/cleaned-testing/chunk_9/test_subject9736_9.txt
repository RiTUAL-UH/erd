 One strategy is to not waste attacks and get VP you don't need - pick and choose high loot bases to attack, and avoid NPC bases if possible (might not be possible at the start though). Another one is to attack everything all the time - you'll lose half of your loot to your bases being attacked, but this might be the more fun way to play the game.
