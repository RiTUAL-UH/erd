 Powerhouse on 5th St. in downtown Santa Rosa - I guess it depends what you're looking for, but I think it's the best all-around gym in town...I pay like 49 a month I think.

 how much can you bench?! 




 damn, you beat me to it.

 The aromatics steam in pork fat for 5 hours.  It all turned out amazing! 




 The cheese and bell pepper were the only 'cheap' ingredients.  The ground pork and bacon is from a pasteur-raised, heirloom hog from a local farm.  The onion, garlic, and chiles are from my back yard...even my chipotle rub is made from garden chiles that I smoked and dried myself.  Thanks for looking! 









 I discover new stuff on bandcamp every day...I do find that on Spotify I tend to listen to the same shit over   over. 




 Deep Rising. 




 it's the Kirkland brand marinated artichoke hearts - I sautee them in a little oil from the jar. 




 I was stoked on it actually...the photo montage is mine.  I whip this up all the time now.  The trick is to get the pan super-hot so you get a nice sear on the chokes.  It's a 2 min recipe that's perfect for guests to snack on while you finish cooking the main dish!

 I like the idea! 




 totally, and sounds like it was recorded deep in some dank cavern.

I love the demo as well..

 I've bought a few 20buckspin releases on a whim and have never been disappointed - Dead in the Manger, Samothrace, Cauldron Black Ram, Vastum, are just a few of the bands I've discovered through 20bs.

 Hypertrichosis?

 it's a really great place to visit w/ the kids throughout the year - it's a short hike and seeing how the ecosystem changes is really cool.

 take the path up the hill behind the Environmental Discovery Center and you'll reach a frog pond - this time of year should be perfect.

 Jackson's is just down the street from Jack   Tony's - go grab a whiskey after you eat.  I don't know about any pop-ups right now in Rosa.  Spinster Sisters is up   coming and worth a try.
