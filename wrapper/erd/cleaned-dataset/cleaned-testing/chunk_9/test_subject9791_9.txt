 It was when the car arrived on the flatbed behind the pits, the Merc's pit crew immediatly covered most of the wings before taking the car down 




 The Hollywood Blondes 




 *face. Oh god I fail at the title

 They earn more from USA though, so we won't be seeing RAW online anytime soon.

 ZZ and Bull Dempsey doing cardio together 




 At least 20 bucks 




 Paint them like TNA does with their belt? 









 Local distribution and info. As well as tech journalist can talk to AMD directly 




 Yes, as well as a dual GPU Fury X

 Read the article. It's a smaller configuration so that it fits thr formula e 3km length limit. 




 If you are going to an F1 weekend, visit their shops. They will be selling out of season items there as well. IIRC Lotus's Kimi Raikkonen's cap were selling at around $10 or $8 when I was at Sepang 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haxuZardUiI
use this version 




 yep. they are not cheap, when in season. but once the season is out, you can get them as low as $10

If the team is doing clearance (Like McLaren clearing all of their Mercedes branded stuffs) it can go as low as $5 




 maybe a temporary one? I can't imagine they would want to add a permanent one when they already took out the old one 









 I forgot that the manufacturers can use their own next season. Hmm, that would be interesting. if Piquet can get a car that is really efficient in energy he will be streaking away at the front 




 Not that I am complaining, but at 2.8km and very little heavy braking zones, the cars would be running well below the 150kw power permitted for teh race to last the whole race. 




 Still an awesome hotlapping sim, but for physics wise I do still gravitate towards rFactor/rFactor2. Mak from Mak Modding Group summed it up http://www.virtualr.net/meet-simfunding-sim-racing-crowd-funding-platform#comment-1871850631 









 No. Thing is Vince TRIED to keep the WCW brand. WWE planned a WCW PPV a month after WM17, and they even wanted to take off Smackdown and put WCW in it's place, but nobody wanted to touch WCW with a 10 foot pole at the time. It does not matter who bought WCW at the end, it would have died 




 I disagree. Behind that "marketing" racing team, most likely lies a real racing team that works hard to win and have a passion for racing. For example Red Bull Racing is nothing more than Horner's own Arden Racing Team. Similar to Marussia, who is just the sponsor, the real team that runs the racing outfit is Manor. Sponsors comes and goes, but these people and team will remain, albeit in another name when the time comes. 




 "Forehead" view more like it. I wish they could put the camera lower but that's unlikely 




 IIRC didn't they let the drivers adjust the front wing once every lap in 2010? 




 Giving a meaningless belt to Jeff is better than WCW giving it's world title to an actor or ECW having Tazz win their belt while under contract with WWE and then having him buried by Triple H the next week 




 Cesaro looks like he unintentionally cosplayed as Lupin

 I am impressed at how many peoples are there. usually there are smaller crowds for house shows 




 Candy cotton 




 For Joe i think it's due to him having agreements to appear in indies and such up till August. Being in NXT means he can fulfil those dates without havimg to travel with thr maim roster 









 Push the Lucha Dragons and The Los Matadores. They would be awesome to watch just for pure wrestling 




 "HAHAHAHA!! YOKOZUNA NAMBA WAN!" 




 Apparently this is due to Hernandez has already left Lucha Underground

http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2015/0625/596626/lucha-underground-news-status-of-hernandez-after-tna-appearance/ 




 Basically as his body slows down, so does his theme? 




 I hope we can get back backstage brael where you can fight everywhere evrn in the kitchen  




 Sorry, I've been reading that as High Memory Bandwidth and just now I realised it was supposed to be the other way around  




 powered DP to Dual DVI adapter then? 




 I think it's due to the limited availability of the HMB and a rather tight schedule, meaning that AMD has a limited card to give out to reviewers this time.  




 Depends. The 980Ti has better overclocking potential (for now). I am waiting for AMD to let the users overclock the HMB, but I think it won't be allowed in the Fury X as of yet. 




 No matter what the number, any advertisement is good for GFW.  




 The search function is fucked up. there is no option to list according to date, instead it will list according to popularity and you're stuck at that 




 375w when overclocked, hence the extra 125w comes from I guess. For all intent and purposes if we are talking about a vanilla R9 Fury X then 275w is the tdp 




 wut 




 indeed. but it WILL make the episode more entertaining, which is a reason to watch 




 THe time they tried the gay storyline with Billy and Chuck  




 The rear view. OH MY GOD! NAOMI IS GOING TO GFW/TNA! 




 "What? What? What?" 




 "Balor spends a lot of years in Japan. Big deal. I spent a lot of years here, doesn't make me an American okay"

Oh god, this is gold 




 Are you using Wifi or LAN? sometimes Wifi can be iffy for streaming 




 Bullet Club/NJPW confirmed for next week 




 As bad as Dana Brook is, she's a whole lot better than most of the Tough Enough contestant 




 I wish that when Enzo and Cass goes to the main roster, someone print out the whole intro sign and make it longer than the NAO one 




 Even in that trainer hoodie Alexa still looks hot 




 Yes 




 If Dr Death had won, it would end at that. Butterbean was introduced specifically because Bart Gunn won that tournament.  




 Started with Trips Wrestlemania entrance correct? I think they are doing this in return for Arnold's appearance there 




 If he joins the Bullet Club it's more likely he's joining NJPW and then have a working relationship with ROH, than him joining ROH directly 




 Weird, still no patch on brake bias not really working during racing with cars that should be able to adjust them (Formula A, Endurance, etc) 




 It was. As did Shumacher's Ferrari. but when Ferrari/Red Bull focused on developing one car to maximise their potential, Mercedes split it down the middle, giving both drivers equal car throughout. 




 The "50p" line is NOT about old tyres, but flatspots.

Also "a dollar short and a day's late", and car handling like "a supermarket trolly" 









 ZZ = Bull Dempsey? 




 Is it just me or does Paige's ring gear hides her rather large assets? 




 Stay Tuned for me 




 Is it just me or does TNA not care that they are using the WWE HOF as part of THEIR storyline. I remember  Hogan giving his ring to Abyss in one episode as well 




 Yeah. his contract won't allow that 




 BRAD MADDOX?! 




 Trying not to be that guy, but mold and mould are two different things 




 With the interest in Lethal by WWE and Ric is under contract with WWE, the future should be fun

 As of right now there is nothing much that linux could offer me. My pc is stable as it is and i am comfortable. I also have an old laptop running crunchbang (ubuntu before this) and a few pi with raspbian that I use as an easy information board system. 

I think the moment i just rather stay with windows was a few years back when I have am optimus based laptop and there was a problem with linux using the nvidia gpu and it always will use the Intel gpu instead no matter what I did

 




 Maybe because I am old (nearing 32) that i am just too lazy to use Linux. Like people that uses OSX instead of Windows because it just works I use Windows instead of Linux because for me that's the easiest to use, especially after a long day of work. 

Ironically i work im IT handling servers and network so i work with Unix almost daily.  




 There are times that it's just better to stick to Windows 




 Too much performance hit, and my Thrustmaster steering and Fanatec pedal won't work, and I am using triple monitor 




 Well, that leads us back to the first problem, all the racing games that utilised the SRW-S1 LED, or can utilise it are Windows based

Hence it's easier for me to just use Windows 




 Go naked and piss on top of our tallest mountain 




 SRW-S1. It has a DLL hook depending on the racing games I play that would light the LED up accordingly.  




 It works as a controller, but as I said, I modded it because I want to use the shift light indicator built into the steering and hence it still will only works for windows :/

thanks anyways.  




 I did say custom or special. The steering wheel will not work, especially for the thrustmaster steering base that the steering wheel can be swapped around as different steering have different buttons and functions 

Fanatec's support say they have no reason to support Linux since most racing games are on Windows

and SteelSeries SRW-S1 works without any driver on Windows 8.1 but certainly not debian 




 I don't care about the lack of directX on linux. What bothers me (and stoppign me from using it) is the lack of drivers for custom or special controllers/peripherals

I have a steering wheel (thrustmaster), a seperate pedal system (Fanatec), and a modded shift light indicator (SteelSeries) and all of them would only work on Windows

 2004 and 2005 was such a breath of fresh air during those years 




 rain makes painted line slipper and there were a lot of cases of cars spinning out on painted lines 




 I am planning to since most are looking like they would be falling apart. Will take time tho. There are hundreds of mags here. 









 I'm actually more impressed with Earl Bamber. He and Tandy was given most of the task to make sure the Porsche pulled out that lead during the night stint. 




 That turn 1 "extend" would definitely be frowned upon this season. But that awesome save into turn 2 




 There are some tracks (like Interlagos) which due to the flowing nature would mean the car would use up more energy that what it's harvesting. You could see this where in qualy they can't do two quick laps, instead a fast lap, a harvesting lap, and then another quick lap.
 




 He was in the first ever RAW, and was in the match where 1-2-3 kid beats Razor Ramon 




 THe first thing that comes to mind was "Oh god, get a tripod son" 




 Whoa, and just last week there were people asking "Why can't F1 show more feeds?" or "Why can't F1 coverage be like MotoGP or WEC?" and today it's like "We're  cool, we know where to find this" 




 He's a glorified seller, not a flippy shit guy so I don't think going to LU would do anything. But he's a good midcard guy to keep and his merchandise is still a good seller so I don't see WWE releasing him anytime soon

 Harry Potter and The Spy That Came In From The Cold

Cold war espionage, with magic 




 Depends. The Chinese Market Lever for example could be done in various ways. Get the poison from the fish seller and poison the food that the guys loves to taste. Or go up to his shelter and wait patiently as he come and kill him. Or take the sniper rifle there and head shot him.

But my best kill is just to slam his car, and when he comes to investigate his alarm, blow it up.  




 Yep. I did that the first time 




 Following other cars and destroying tyres have been prevalent for years. It's only today with a lot more messages being aired that we think it's getting worse. 

They should find something that negates the dirty air effect. Ground effect has been thrown around, but teams are not keen to go back on them. 

One solution is to ditch wings altogether. Surely would make Raikkonen and Lauda happier 




 I think the worked shoot was well hidden at the time. Most if not all thought it was a legit storyline, where Punk actually did took the belt as his contract was up

Will take a long time till WWE can top that 




 Yep. I was surprised as well 




 I said the right "idea". The execution meanwhile... 









 With lyrics the song is actually good 




 They usually have quite a lot of working relationship with promotions that are not on national TV. 




 Russo had the right idea when he joined WCW to elevate the young talents and replace the old guards.

I just hate his crash style booking tho :/ 




 All wrestlers have that "opening identity" that makes it easy for people to recognise who the wrestler is from just a few bars.

Most of Jim Johnston's music has this style. They range from a signature sound; Austin's glass shatter, Mick Foley's car crash, Undertaker's gong; or a signature line that is sung; The Rock, BA Billy Gunn, The Big Show; those songs were easy to identify and would always instantly make you recognise who is coming out 




 Owens vs Paige Wrestlemania confirmed 




 Also i think the reason why not just Wwe but most wrestling shows in general do not submit to be considered for an emmy because they feel like the EMMY is for a normal drama and not suited for a kayfaybe industry like theirs

 




 Nice spot. I was busy wondering if I could disguise as the model on the catwalk when I watched the trailer 




 Petronas Green you mean 




 Luger? 




 I was expecting Doritos with that actually 




 MOD for L4D I think 




 Fucking mountain dew  




 Made me chuckle

 12 hours difference (starts at 9am 17/06 here) and watching in the office. Twitch is a bit laggy tho 




 Depends as well. The curved screen gives quite the immersive experience I've read. And Depth of Field is not really something of a priority, since they are usually running a single car in simulation. If it was a race simulation with multiple cars, that would be something else 



















 it's my cake day when I posted that to imgur :/

 For a PPV, they hang out if there is a last minute change or something. 

For RAW/Smackdown, they also have dark matches, WWE Main Event and WWE Superstars 




 Erick Rowan also starred in a Norwegian reality TV show IIRC. It was posted by another redditor here  




 In Sepang, there is a built in Petronas station at the back of the pit complex. Usually support races where they are running cars that have been minimally altered but FIA approved uses this facility.  




 Not feasible I should think. It would be much more logical to use the full motion rig with the real steering wheel in front of them than using VR

Also VR won't give them any advantage. It's slightly more laggier, as well as drivers don't even have much range of head movement in the cockpit in real life means there is no reason for them to use it 




 I think it was not even WWE that noticed it, but fans who were coming to Wrestlemania and bringing the "Streak" signs
