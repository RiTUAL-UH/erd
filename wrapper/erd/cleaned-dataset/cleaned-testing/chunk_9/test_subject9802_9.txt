 Thanks! :) 




 Thanks! Keep practicing! It's frustrating at first but it really allows you to be way more forgiving of your art's natural flaws... Actually, just about all of my favorite work in the past few years was done with a right handed sketch and cleaned up with my left :) 




 Very cute! I'm sad there's no walrus and the carpenter, though :) 




 Great colors and angle!

I can't sleep so I've been doodling and waiting to post these, haha. This is my first sketchdaily!  
I haven't really been drawing much lately, so it feels great to take it up again! Rodent like creatures are fun :3 




 Great pic! Your tumblr is stunning 




 These are amazing 




 This is amazing! Arya's my homework and Song of the Sea is such a beautiful movie, too.  




 RIP Beau Biden!  
Well, I agree with you there. Honesty is important and I agree you 100% deserved the truth... Sadly, people do stupid things when they feel guilty about their stupid choices. I'm glad things are better post divorce, though! I think the best you can do is focus on your own happiness now :) 




 I would wait a couple more days and rather than text/call her saying you want to go on another date, text/call her and give more concrete plans and let her take the reins... For example "Hey, X, how does a road trip to the beach and having a picnic by the water sound? Friday at 8 work for you?"  or something to that tune depending on where you live and what y'all find to be fun and appropriate. 




 You wrote this like a beat poet. 

I'm sorry for the salt in the wound, but all in all it sounds like it was all for the best. Not everyone is the same; not everyone is capable of monogamy and it seems like you and your ex were fundamentally different. Was it wrong for her to not tell you her true intent? Yes. Can you blame her, though? That's a tough pill to swallow and it sounds like you and she will live a happier life doing your own thing. I honestly just hope for the best for your daughter and that she doesn't get introduced to a rotating door of weird partners via your wife and her new man.  

Also, get checked for STD's like everyone else has said. 




 Wow holy shit are you living my exact life? I have fought tooth and nail with my bf about his psycho ex contacting him with inappropriate stuff and he can't understand why I want her gone. He also doesn't understand how him talking to her is just encouraging her negative behavior. Hugs, OP. I hope things go well! 




 Oh also I now have the imagine of the police blacking up a body after shooting it.

 The Wind in the Willows 




 Ahahaha, I am a part of the room mate dynamic and when they *asked me what I preferred*, I answered them honestly. That also included me stating that I was willing to move out myself. 




 Also, the girl JUST got out of a relationship where they were saying they loved each other. It's just... It feels odd. 




 Grackles are some tough motherfuckers. I've seen some really fucked up looking grackles just going about their day unfazed. 




 Reason A is directly linked to reason B...So, yes. If I didn't live with both of them, I'd be fine with visits and hearing the resulting porkfest. I just don't want to live with a couple; even if they're my friends. 




 True. Very good point. I thought I was okay with it but hearing them occupy the one bathroom for 45 minutes to fuck is kind of annoying... And then loudly fucking twice more, once while I'm trying to work from home is a little more than I bargained for, so I kind of just made the change of heart today. 




 Additionally, I don't find him relatable because we have very little shared interests and holding a conversation just feels forced. He is a great man and I love him as a room mate, but I could live without him without losing any sleep over it, that's all. 




 I've heard my room mates have plenty of sex. Just not with each other. I just don't like living with couples. Is there something wrong with having that preference even if the couple happens to be my friends? 




 Never issues. I've just never really felt compelled to converse with him. I don't find him relatable.  




 I live in a city with lots of options, so I'm sure it would be doable in short notice. I can always stay at my current apartment if they choose to move out. 




 Yeah. I'm going to take a day or so to think about a tactful and understandable way to approach it. I feel like I'm going to lose my friendship over this. I guess if that's the case, it was never really meant to be, though, eh?  




 That's the thing. I have lived with boyfriends before and have even had the "ideal" living situation where we kept separate rooms "just in case" and it has still gone up in flames. Though, I'm a very solitary person and enjoy my alone time and independence, so I may differ from them there. It's just hard to see myself in their shoes because I've been there (but always lived alone with a partner) and it was not fun. 




 Already on it. I'm honestly looking at places with them and on my own simultaneously, just in case. I'm leaning more and more towards an independent move at this point, though. 




 We've discussed it. It's a really weird conversation to have because they don't even know what to label their relationship yet. It's overall just kind of messy in my eyes and I've expressed my anxiety. I then felt incredibly guilty because a few of my coworkers at the bar (I work at a bar in addition to a full time desk job) seemed to think I was being unreasonable for feeling nervous/hesitant and told them I would live with them and get over it.... I am not over it. 




 It's hard to put my finger on it. I think mostly it feels like I'm hearing my brother and sister fucking each other if that makes sense. Beyond that, I just have never really liked the idea of living with a couple. Especially new couples. No matter how well we get along and how well we know each other,  it's still a new relationship and things could change for the worse.  
 nbsp;  
Also, to be completely honest, I've never felt as comfortable hanging out with the guy alone without her there to facilitate the conversation so, meh.   




 The three of us all met when we moved into this apartment and have fortunately gotten along really well. The two of them have always seemed close but aside from my friends joking to me that they seem to have chemistry, nothing has really happened.  

 nbsp;  

Somewhere over the last few weeks, they've started hooking up. Honestly, I'm not surprised at all by this and I think they would make a great couple, but what bothers me is the fact that we had intended to look for new apartments together as our lease ends in August. When they found out I knew, we had a chat and discussed options and both of them seemed surprised that I was hesitant to move into a new place with them.  

 nbsp;  

Ive never found myself in a situation like this and I dont know if all three of us living together is the best idea. I could honestly live with it, but its not my preferred option. I mentioned to them that I would rather one of them live elsewhere but now, honestly, I think that the girl would just end up resenting me for breaking up "the group" or think I'm a tightass or something.  

 nbsp;  

After a long talk with them and consulting some friends, I decided that maybe I was just being sensitive and that I should just suck it up and give it a shot. We all get along so well and we all know we like living together so it's possible it could work... But this is all uncharted waters for me and I'm having second thoughts. We looked at a new apartment today and we would have signed for it if the landlord hadn't found a more long term candidate and I'm honestly relieved. I can't help it, but hearing them fucking makes me incredibly uncomfortable and almost like a "prisoner" in my own home and a thirdwheel amongst my room mates. I feel incredible guilt that I'm reacting this way. I feel unreasonable and childish that I can't just nut up about it but I keep going back and forth between acceptance, anger, sadness and anxiety about my living situation.  

 nbsp;  

**tl;dr**: I love my room mates of two years, but ever since they started hooking up (past few weeks) I no longer feel comfortable living in my apartment with them. Am I being unreasonable?

 nbsp;

**UPDATE:** Thanks for all your help and advice, all! It means a lot to hear so many different opinions. I sent a text to my room mates that said:
"Hey guys, I've been thinking about this and I think I need to give up the search. It's been great living with you both and I love you both but I just dont think I am ready to take on a new apartment. I probably am going to stay at the current place until I get my finances more in order. I think you two should continue to look for a place together, though."  
 nbsp;

Hopefully they'll be understanding and the next few months won't be super awkward... 




 Good luck! I'm not good at math but I think one person has good odds :) 




 Much respect to you for trying to take a literal route without being too overwhelming!  




 How did you answer his questions? 




 True, but I feel like so often if parents or support systems don't broach the subject appropriately when a child inquires, it can cause some  issues, complexes  or phobias. 




 He's a big guy I guess? Not huge or fat or anything. He works as the door guy at saloon. 




 Thanks! 




 Haha, hey Tom. The person stole the mask from Nick. I'm sure you'll hear about it tonight :) 




 Really? Around what time? 




 Thank you. I know it isn't much, but this mask means a lot to my friend. He was really upset about it. 




 I've played tug of war over a kiddie pool filled with baked beans... This kind of reminds me of that. It was pretty gross, but it was entertaining! 




 My friend is an artist who also works at saloon as the bouncer. He puts a lot of time, care and effort into making his costumes for Halloween as he works during that season as an extra. He was closing up saloon and foundry tonight around 12:45-12:55pm when someone stole his mask from the host stand at saloon. We are trying to locate the theif or at the very least, his mask he has worked hard on. If anyone sees any goons bragging about their find or sees anything on social media, please let me know. Thank you!!! 









 wow, wow, wow. 




 Jaguars... They already are. They like to eat hallucinogenic plants and trip balls. 




 Haha yes! I love how he asked for BREAD but you read BEARD. I thought I was crazy at first 




 Oh! I used this exact photo [as a reference for a painting of mine](http://faunus-crypticus.tumblr.com/post/102707799430/work-in-progress) 




 Poor barn owl. Too bad collecting it's bones is illegal. 




 My cat's name is Hercules, too! Goooooo Hercules!!! 




 I look forward to seeing you again! Keep kicking ass! 




 OMG I totally talked to you at saloon like, two Sunday's ago! I was your waitress. GO YOU! I remember that you are such a beam of sunshine and now I understand why!!! Keep that kickass spirit. People pay attention to a positive attitude :) 




 I'm gonna guess [life](/sp) ? Considering [a cheating man leads a double+ life to maintain his many relationships](/sp)
