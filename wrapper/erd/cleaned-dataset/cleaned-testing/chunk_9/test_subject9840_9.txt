 I don't know why but when I saw this happen I distinctly remember not caring either way. I think I am now apathetic to people's transport woes. 

But now I've had a chance to think about it, I suppose I think they're stupid trying to take on a bus - I mean what if the driver doesn't see them? Why is their time frame more important than people on the bus? 

On the other hand, why are bus drivers assholes sometimes and why do they go out of their way not to pick up passengers? Why are buses so damn unreliable and instead of just working to a schedule, why do 3 buses come at once? Why is it when I submitted complaint forms about the buses all coming at once they tell me that it's because of traffic, but how could they all arrive at once in traffic? Wouldn't they have to have still left the same time to be at the same point in the traffic to arrive at the exact same time? 

I don't even know where to direct my frustration anymore, I'm so frustrated with the whole bus system and all the passengers have gone crazy including me!!!  




 I thought this was from /r/gaming because it was too perfect! 




 I'm glad to hear you had a good time! :) 

I'm not too sure about weekdays as I don't often go out mid-week. I suppose if we were going out we'd go somewhere that was convenient (for a few after-work drinks), has food, or somewhere that was scenic/special (for a special occasion). 

For you I'd check out the scenic/special stuff. If it's nice weather try out Opera Bar. Palmer   Co is busy most days it's open, so you could definitely try that out - it's down a little alley in a basement near the Establishment Hotel so you'll need to search it out. There is also [Tank Stream Bar](http://merivale.com.au/tankstreambar) nearby that which has a small bar feel in a back alley, which I like. Tank Stream Bar is probably nothing too special but I like it. 

There is another place which is pretty popular for food (southern American feel) but damn it's hard to find unless you have a guide taking you there. It sits on the top of an office building, so when you enter it's like you're going into some offices. It's called [The Rook](http://therook.com.au/).

The bankers I have worked with are often pretty good drinkers, so anywhere around Martin Place. We sometimes go to [Eden Bar](http://edenbarandrestaurant.com.au/) but I imagine that'll get empty pretty quickly as people wind up their after works drinks.

Also Newtown will have some students there mid-week because they don't have to wake up in the morning ;) So check out some of the places I've mentioned there.

I have to head out now but I'll have a think about some more locations.

For the football if you're going to the game then the only places where those fans will be is near Parramatta. There are a few food places in Church Street in Parramatta (depending on which team you're going for), but to be honest I never go out there so I may not be the best person to ask. I also think you'll find most football fans will head home straight after the game, and only a small handful will stay out.  




 I am the same... I think it's good to have a diverse set of skills. My hope is that it means you can adapt quicker to changes in your industry and you get to be continually learning and improving. My problem early on was getting a job in some of the roles which needed dedicated experience in one thing. But I've personally found more job satisfaction in learning new and different things all the time, and if anything I am more in demand now than I would have been otherwise, due to my wide range of experience.

Good luck with your decision! Go with your gut. I've found mine to be leading me in the right direction most of the time. :) 




 I actually asked for a pay increase in the interview once before I'd even gotten the job. I'm not sure if I'd ever do it again but sometimes I wonder if it helped being confident enough to ask.

I said "I wanted to ask if you have room to move on the salary?" 

I got the job and a higher salary. It helps that it actually was very low... but it was risky! I didn't have another option if I didn't get that job... but I had a pretty good vibe from the interviewer.  




 I've noticed some companies I've applied for can have a lot of job openings. It makes me wonder if there is a high turnover or if they are rapidly expanding for a particular piece of work. 

The former bothers me because it might not be a good place to work if turnover is high. 

The latter concerns me but only if they are hiring for a short term role and the position is a permanent full time role... because I'll wonder if they can keep me on once the project finishes. It's not a deal breaker as I might be OK with another job after the project is over but I'd prefer to go in with eyes open than not to know. Also if a new project has just started and they're rushing to hire and/or trouble getting enough qualified staff, that tells me I might be in for some long hours. Again I might be OK with that, but I have never met an interviewer who has been up front about working until 11pm every night and on weekends, so I try to suss it out. Better to go in with eyes open!

Also I find questions about how I'd fit into the organization useful. It gets them to visualize me there for starters. Second it gives me an idea of the career development opportunities and advancement options.

I also try to get them to describe their culture. This tells me about the type of people who work there. And who my colleagues are is one of the most important factors as to whether I will enjoy my job.  




 Just to clarify I'm not saying it's not possible to get opportunities and build skills in stable jobs... it was that way with mine though. It was difficult to be "given a chance" as the culture was a very risk averse old school government culture. I went as far as I could through sheer determination and then realized I'd reached their limit of what they could offer me for my career development.  




 Not sure if this will make you feel better but I left a very stable reasonably well paid job for something less stable. I did it to get more opportunities and experience. I don't regret it at all. Having the ability and the skills has provided me with more "stability" by being in demand by the market than any "safe" job would have. 

I have friends that are in those safe jobs with few options to move to another company as their skills and experiences are fewer than peers who took the chance and built their skills faster. For me it meant working harder but I think in the long run it has paid off. 




 This is pretty accurate.

There is more variation in Sydney than in say for example Cairns where they just have wet and dry. I prefer it though because in Sydney in summer when you get a really hot day usually it's rare to have a lot in a row. They will often be followed by thunderstorms or sometimes continue but rarely for more than say 5 days.

The other thing is that in Sydney 'rainy' is affected heavily by the ENSO cycle. So if it's an El Nino then little rain and of there's a La Nina then lots of rain. When it's not clearly one of either... you can get anything.  




 The basics of how their own body works. I know lots of people know this but lots don't. 

A basic understanding of the immune system. For example knowing how antibiotics and vaccines work. 

Also, knowing about personal hygiene and how simple hand washing, not spitting, etc. can prevent the spread of diseases and germs.

Edit: elaborated. 




 Oh wow. I was told if they sting you around the neck it's possible to suffocate... is that true? Lucky you made it! 




 I drive past [King's Costumes](http://www.kingscostumes.com.au/) sometimes - looks alright. 




 Ferry to Manly   walk around the beach there. There is a [market there on the weekend](http://www.manlymarketplace.com.au/).

If it's raining, the [Powerhouse museum](http://maas.museum/powerhouse-museum/). It's being relocated at some point out of the city so see it while you can.

Also some others have mentioned the art galleries if it's raining, but I also like the [Australian Museum](http://australianmuseum.net.au/).

If you want to see Australian animals and don't want to leave the city try [Wildlife Sydney](http://www.wildlifesydney.com.au/) next to the [Sydney Aquarium](http://www.sydneyaquarium.com.au/) in Darling Harbour.
 




 Rhodes Phoenix gets packed. Make sure you get there by 11am otherwise there is usually quite a long wait :( 




 Aw yeah, I'd be flattered if someone thought I was their best friend! 




 I think she'd just appreciate the effort. :) I'm not much of a cook either but my mum likes it anyway... at least she says she does.  




 What about organizing something at your house with your family? Everyone make a special dish and bring it along. Dress up in some nice clothes, and get her to as well so she feels special and treat her to a massage or hairdo while you set it all up with a pretty table cloth and a bunch of flowers on the table. Be sure to make some nice desserts.  




 Sorry to hear about your cat :( My cat died years ago but I still miss her sooo much. There will never be another cat like her, but I am glad I got to have her in my life.  




 Didnt she swim away from the nearest land mass? The pic shows it. Maybe the currents carried her... Some of the currents out there are really strong. Either way I think she was incredibly lucky. 




 If you are going to take a pomeranian on a boat, you can get it a life jacket to counter the weight of the hair! It probably saved the life of [this fuzzball](http://www.globalanimal.org/2012/06/08/dog-overboard-canine-safety-on-boats/) 




 I would say this is part of the reason why maths is hard but not the full answer.

It's true, I wasn't that interested in maths in high school or uni because it wasn't applied. For the most part it was pretty dry. I only really liked Matrix Applications because I already understood why it was useful for me, but other subjects like Differential Calculus I had a really hard time relating to. It wasn't until I was trying to solve a few different problems a few years later that I gained an interest. 

One reason I say that I don't think lack of an interesting problem is the whole answer, is that I think the foundations are important (like someone said in another post). For example, I was trying to figure out how far galaxies are from the Earth. This is a terribly complex problem because things in space move around, and if you also imagine the things we are seeing are light years away, they are also an image from the past. Anyway it involves some complex mathematics and physics, which was quite interesting. However it was still hard for me because I don't have a physics background to understand some of the concepts that the math for this problem was built on, and so the learning curve was huge for me.

I also think there is a level of patience required. If you don't get past that initial learning curve (which may be unpleasant), then you never get to feel the sense of achievement having conquered it, and the next time you face a difficult problem, you might not be so keen to persevere, and especially if this has happened a few times, you probably have lost confidence in your ability to do it. Hence the 'hard' comes from lack of motivation... the task is more arduous now that you don't want to do it. 




 My celebrant would non-legally marry you. She told me it just wouldn't be "official" without the paperwork - so the date would be different - no big deal really. You can have the ceremony but the paperwork would come later. It shouldn't be a problem. Try talking to a celebrant about it. They should know.  




 I like the Royal Botanical Gardens [eg1](https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0013/102316/Image-2-EL-600.jpg), [eg2](https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0010/102304/Photo-Gallery-4-RG-600.jpg), [eg3](https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0007/112768/Herb_Gdn_Pavilion_05.jpg), [eg4](https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0019/112771/Herb_Gdn_Pavilion_21.jpg), tho there are permits specifically for weddings and professional photography. If you don't have a permit you may get kicked out. 

If you look at the wedding pack guides on this page you will see the pricing down on about the 3rd page.
https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/welcome/royal_botanic_garden/venues_and_weddings/weddings/Wedding_Ceremony_and_Photography_Locations

For under 10 people you can book a lawn for $275 on weekdays and $330 on weekends (before June 2014, so prices have probably changed - but will be around that price). 

You also need to apply to take photographs in the QVB. You need to make a donation. I can't remember the fee exactly. I don't think it was much - maybe $50 or something like that. Anyway you can apply [here](https://www.qvb.com.au/about-qvb/wedding-photography) and there is a number on that page too you can call to discuss with them.


Another place which is nice is the [Chinese Gardens](http://www.easyweddings.com.au/locations/chinese-garden-of-friendship/) in Darling Harbour, but there is a lot of construction happening over that way at the moment :(

You could also do a wedding over near Manly way (north side of the harbour). There are council fees for beach weddings. There's a list of places [here](http://www.manly.nsw.gov.au/community-services/weddings/) and the fees are listed at the bottom of the page.  




 Celebrants aren't too hard to find if you're not picky. Easiest way to meet some is to go to a [Wedding Expo](http://www.easyweddings.com.au/expos/#/new-south-wales), but if you don't have time to do that you can just search online or try going through the ones on [EasyWeddings](http://www.easyweddings.com.au/MarriageCelebrant/Sydney/) or on the [Marriage Celebrants of Australia Website](http://www.marriagecelebrants.org.au/). 

Photographers vary in price and quality. Be careful of their offerings - there are a lot of dodgy photographers out there. We used [Xtraordinary](http://www.xtraordinarysydney.com.au/) and they were great - honest and up-front with their pricing - no dodgy stuff. Not top of the line artsy style photos but good wedding photos that I love and will be able to keep forever. 




 We got married in 2013 and our celebrant cost $598. 




 This is either some weird kind of problem solving, or he has a strange fetish.  




 The price guide was $1m. The RP data report valued the house at mid $900s.

I should really expect this by now, but sometimes we look at similar houses in the same suburb or street even and the price guide is actually quite close (within 10%), but this time we just got outbid. 




 That sounds great! Maybe you could PM me some contact info - I would love to see how much it's valued at. We have some interesting things in there! I never get to show them to anyone because I don't think many people are that interested, so it would be fun to show someone else. :) 

I am kind of interested in finding coins in the 'Southern Sky' series at the moment - they're colourful domed coins. I think the only coin available through the RA Mint now is the 2014 Orion coin, but there were two previous coins I would love to get my hands on - one is Pavo (2013) which I have found for $200 and the other one is the Southern Cross. Got any ideas where I could source it for a decent price? I've seen it online for $800, but I question whether I am that avid a collector... :/
 




 Oh! I'm going to check that out! Thanks! 




 Ohhh, I have a big coin collection, but I don't know if it's worth that much. What coins do you think are worth collecting? I know a lot of them are produced in 10,000 batches, but you can get some gold ones that are only 1,500 batch size. Do they increase in value more? Are there are lot of people who collect and trade coins? I only really collect them, I don't trade them. I just like looking at them. My parents started the collection so we have a lot of old pre-decimal coins, and I think we even have some paper value documents - though I only heard about those from my mum the other day and have yet to check them out.  




 Sure! That's a great idea! I would call my frog "coffee" and confuse everyone by explaining how I found coffee in the creek. 

Cups are very versatile vessels though! You can use them for all sorts of things... storing your spare water, as a coin holder, for collecting hail in a hailstorm, in case of motion sickness, for holding a candle, for protecting your hands from sparklers, to listen to conversations on the other side of walls, for keeping spare cup sized cupcakes, for entertaining children by using it as a nose, etc. etc.  




 They own their debt.  




 Yeah! He was honest!  




 Yeah this real estate agent saved me some money. The property has been taken down now and the auction cancelled. So I'm actually pretty thankful. He could have led me on to hedge his bets and I would have wasted my time and money getting it checked out only to find out very soon after that I never had a chance.

The people I really dislike are auctioneers. I saw one son trying to buy a place for his mum in Annandale and he'd hit his limit and she was trying to convince him to keep going. He said he couldn't to his mum several times, but the auctioneer wouldn't leave him   his mum alone, trying to convince them to up their bid. The auctioneer was saying things like "You'll have to face your mum later!" and trying to convince the mum to convince her son, saying it's a "once in a lifetime opportunity" etc. etc.  The poor guy had to yell out "No mum! I don't have that much money!" in front of a huge audience of about 100 people. It was a small townhouse/unit that went for over $1.2m. 

I know it's their job and all but their tactics suck. 




 In the inner city, we have generally found it to be between 30% over the price guide. I'm talking about a year ago when $1m houses were going for $1.3m - a bit more than $50-100K, we were budgeting for at least $200K over the price guide.

However, in the Sydney suburbs it can vary greatly. Sometimes they go for right near the price guide, so it's a bit hit and miss, and depends on who is interested. I've found them generally go for 0-20% over the price guide.  




 There are some agents who arrange the building   pest inspection and you only pay the $40 or whatever it was if you end up being a registered bidder at the auction. I like that approach, though it is subject to abuse. 




 You know how some shirts have that handkerchief pocket at the front? Well if you get a little plastic cup then you can put it in your pocket and carry it around wherever you go! It's the best invention ever, amiright? :D 




 How about this one which has "Australian Citizenship" written on it
http://www.perthmint.com.au/catalogue/2014-australian-citizenship-1-dollar-coin-in-card.aspx
It's more affordable too :) 




 Actually one birthday I did something like this for my husband. I bought a range of between 12 and 24 craft beers (can't remember the exact number) from NSW. Maybe OP could do a selection of one or two from each state?  




 XXXX isn't that bad! It may not be a 1664 but it's on tap and it goes down nicely in the hot rainy weather.  




 Haha I love this. I am right there... almost at "reject your belief in property as a concept". 

We were looking to bid on a property at auction this coming weekend - not that close to the CBD but that's what we can afford. The price guide was within our budget. So I rang the agent. Apparently someone has put in a pre-auction offer for $200,000 more than the guide, when the price guide was already 10% higher than similar properties in the area sold this month. A very similar property **just sold** for below the guided price.

He told me not to waste my money on the pest inspection unless I could put in a bid higher than that. At least I didn't waste my money, but dammit! It's soul crushing. 




 There are a list of fees for NSW Ambulances [here](http://www.ambulance.nsw.gov.au/Accounts--Fees/Frequently-Asked-Questions.html).

 Is that available for NSW?  




 I don't know but while I was looking it up I learnt that otters can hold their breath for 8 minutes and hippos can't actually swim or float due to their density. 




 A cup!

I know this question wasn't for me but I had to. Sorry. I'll go back to sleep now.  




 Haha. 

I was working on a big data project... or trying... and I was generating a base file that was 3GB and it took 12 hours from home to upload. If I went to the office it took 20 mins. Downloading it on the other end in SF took 8 minutes. I had to generate this file and upload it a couple of times during development. I feel like I am living in Internet poverty having had to drive to the office in the early hours of the morning to upload a file.  




 Yeah that makes sense. Plus parkland to make it a nice place to live. I don't think Green Square has much parkland at all. 




 Leichhardt used to be renowned for their slow development approvals. Then the NSW government stepped in and took approval rights away from them and [approved this]( http://m.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/inner-west/controversial-leichhardt-development-given-green-light-despite-community-outcry/story-fngr8h4f-1226847080770). 

I agree with keeping some heritage buildings though. Would you really want to just rip it all up? There are cases when they've done this in the UK and it has culturally ruined areas that were vibrant and turned them into places where people don't want to live.  




 Flatulence is pretty important! If you couldn't let it out you'd get an almighty belly ache, and could possibly explode! (I don't really know this but it sounds plausible right? ) 




 Well they redevelop what they can. What about the old children's hospital in Camperdown where [Trio](http://www.triosydney.com.au/trio/default.asp?cID=2) is and the current developments at [Harold Park]( http://haroldparkbymirvac.com/)? Sydney Uni did a big [student accommodation development]( http://www.sydneyuv.com.au/) near Newtown about 10 years ago too. And around a lot of the inner west there have been factories redeveloped into units, tho not high rises. [Central Park]( http://www.centralparksydney.com/) across from UTS is a new one too and I think there are still buildings going up. I don't know if you remember but Broadway used to be mostly squatters living in falling down terrace shops and that's all been redone to high rises - don't know the building names. I know it's not really inner west but Pyrmont has the highest density population in Sydney.

I don't think the city areas aren't taking whatever they can hold. The one place I do think is taking more than its fair share of high rise buildings is probably Mascot and Green Square. I mean... have you seen it lately? It's jam packed with residential high rises now. If you went there ten years ago and back now you wouldn't recognize it. 




 The fried tofu there is really yummy, and I'm not even a vegetarian and would never think of tofu as something yummy. 




 I like this place too. Yum :) 




 Thanks! I didn't know about the phasing out and eligibility.  




 That makes sense. I have found public hospitals to be quite good also, so not bagging them at all. 

My experience was slightly different because my scans were considered to be 'probably' not urgent, so I rolled the dice. I had short term vision loss, so I was told I should get an MRI of my brain. I had a choice to go private and have the appointment in approx. 3 weeks or go to the public system and have the appointment in approx. 2 months. The doctor said it's unlikely it's serious, but we needed to do the scan in case it was a tumour, so I decided to wait. Total cost for me was $0 too. Turned out pretty good - and my brain is fine (for now!). Had it been some kind of brain tumour though, I may have regretted my decision. 

I was also told by the GP who referred me to the Neurologist, that the medicare cover for the brain MRI would have been lower from the GP compared to if the neurologist referred me, even after paying the neurologist appointment fee. 

[Reading this](http://www.nps.org.au/medical-tests/medical-imaging/for-individuals/types-of-imaging/mri-magnetic-resonance-imaging/for-individuals/costs-and-reimbursements) - it sounds like if I went to the private hospital I would have had to pay the full amount myself. And there is some other option I didn't know about - going to a public hospital as a private patient - which I've never done.  




 Ah I checked and you're right. It doesn't cover all specialists. I was thinking of the time I went to the podiatrist, and some of it was paid for with my extras cover. 

I remember that I later went to the foot surgeon though, and had to fork out the whole $180 with no rebate. 

I'll fix it! Thanks. 




 My personal experience is that this has been the case when going to specialists under my health insurer. 

Edit: Yep, made a mistake. Fixed in original post. 




 Ah I didn't know that! I should get my dental work done then! 




 Good luck! Don't worry - tech interviews suck for everyone! 




 I love doing this. I don't mind a pre-packed box of roast beef and potatoes for $4 or whatever it is! 




 Aw thanks! :) So much reddit love. 




 Apparently some of the City Supermarket stores have Canadian   American sweets - [this review](http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/city-supermarket-sydney?hrid=1jHrKkjPztckhlR5rTzFrg) mentions Canada Dry.


You can also get it online from USAFoods (in Melbourne).
 




 There's a few aspects to this. But let me break it down into a few parts. I'll talk about hospital cover first.


**Tax - Medicare Levy Surcharge** (relates to hospital cover)

If you earn over a certain income ($88K in FY2013-2014) and you don't have private health insurance (hospital cover), you need to pay the Medicare Levy Surcharge - this can be between 1-1.5% of your income. For me this would actually work out to be more than paying for private health insurance (hospital cover only). See the [ATO Website](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/Medicare-levy-surcharge/). Or see [this](http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/incentivessurcharges/mls.htm) - also a good page on the medicare levy.


**Lifetime Health Cover Loading** (relates to hospital cover)

If you don't get private health insurance before you turn 30, and you want to get it at a later stage, then you'll pay a surcharge for your insurance (it starts at 2% and is added to each year you don't get it). This can be up to 70% more than what other people pay depending on how long you leave it for. There's some good information [here](http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/incentivessurcharges/lifetimehealthcover.htm) about it. 


**Value** (in regards to hospital cover)

In terms of hospital cover, what's included depends on the insurer - you should look at each of the offerings. They each offer different brackets - you can get basic, medium, pregnancy, etc. cover depending on the insurance company.

The main benefit is the reduced waiting periods and some of the extra benefits that you can get while being in hospital such as a private room and being able to choose your own doctor.

If I had a baby for example, I might want a private room (in public hospitals they usually put you in a room with other women   their babies who've just given birth - my sister was in a room with 4 women and it was noisy so hard to sleep). I'm a light sleeper so this would be important to me. I might also want a particular doctor to be present during the birth. In public hospitals they often make heavy use of midwives. That is okay for a non complicated birth but if you run into trouble, you might want your own gynecologist there who has been treating you for the duration of your pregnancy. 

Generally I treat hospital insurance as useful for a "just in case" scenario. For example let's say you injure your knee, and you need a replacement knee. In a public hospital you might have to serve a waiting period and you may not get a choice of which doctor performs the surgery. Another example is if you accidentally got pregnant. There is a waiting period for pregnancies meaning that you can't take out private health insurance *after* you get pregnant - well I mean you can, but you have to serve a waiting period until you can claim on it. It's like having a car crash and trying to get insurance after the car crash to cover it - generally not possible. So if you don't have it prior you would probably have to go through the public hospital system.


**Extras**

Edit: I made some mistakes here. I've corrected it. Sorry for the confusion!

~~Extras cover includes things like regular visits to specialists. The operation the specialist performs might be covered under private *hospital* health insurance but generally I've found visits to the specialist are not unless you have extras cover - and then there is a gap. So if you pay $100 for a service, maybe $60 is paid to you from the private health insurer, so you have to foot the remaining $40 yourself.~~

Extras cover includes things like regular visits to the dentist, optometrist, physio, chiro, etc. One example of something you might use in your 25-30 year range might be [wisdom teeth removal](http://www.phio.org.au/facts-and-advice/dental-and-oral-surgery.aspx). I had mine removed in the chair so I just paid at the counter and got a percentage of that back from my health insurer using my extras cover. There are limits as to what you can claim, so for example on a service that is $100 you would maybe get $60 back from your extras cover, and then pay the $40 yourself. This is the 'gap' payment. You can often do this up to another limit, say $500 in a single year for dental. However if you get your wisdom teeth removed under a general anaesthetic then you may be covered under your private hospital cover (e.g. see under 'Major Dental' on the [nib page](http://www.nib.com.au/health-insurance/compare-hospital)). 

If you are likely to use physiotherapists, remedial massage, general dental, optical etc. then it might be worth it for you. You have to do the sums for your situation. 

However I had extras cover for quite a few years and I didn't find extras cover to be worth it. It has ended up costing me more for the premium than what I claim on it. There is a gap with most ~~specialists~~ covered services - so I'd rather just pay the full cost myself. Maybe later in life when I need to go to ~~specialists~~ these service providers more I will get it again, but right now I don't benefit from it. 

Another example why I think it's not worth it right now is I recently got some dental work done. A small percentage of the cost of fillings was covered. But I had to get in-lays which are similar to crowns. They are very expensive. In some way they are cosmetic but my filling was falling out due to the lack of original tooth structure so it was the best option for me. This was not covered by my extras cover from my health insurer and I paid thousands of dollars for it out of my own pocket. This is really what convinced me that extras cover wasn't worth it.


**Medical Expenses Tax Rebates**

This is not an reason for/against private health insurance. Just a tax-time tip if you have a few large health bills.

If you do end up spending a significant amount on medical expenses then you might be able to claim tax offsets - i.e. pay less tax (provided you keep the receipts). 
See [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Income-and-deductions/Offsets-you-can-claim/Medical-expenses/).
If you earn under $88K then you can claim 20% of expenses where they are over $2,162.
If you earn over $88K then you can claim 10% of expenses where they are over $5,100.

The types of medical expenses covered are listed out [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Tax-Return/2013/Supplementary-tax-return/Tax-offset-questions-T4-T11/T6---Total-net-medical-expenses/). 

Medical expenses include payments: 

* to dentists, orthodontists or registered dental mechanics

* to opticians or optometrists, including for the cost of prescription spectacles or contact lenses

* to a carer who looks after a person who is blind or permanently confined to a bed or wheelchair

* for therapeutic treatment under the direction of a doctor

* for medical aids prescribed by a doctor

* for artificial limbs or eyes and hearing aids

* for maintaining a properly trained dog for guiding or assisting people with a disability (but not for social therapy)

* for laser eye surgery, and

* for treatment under an in-vitro fertilisation program.

*See comments below - this is being phased out.*



Edit: I also know it is possible to get a Chronic Disease Management Plan if you are seriously unwell, and there are also Mental Health Care plans for psychiatric care. This enables related services to be covered (to a limit) under medicare.  




 No probs! I hope you have a great time here. :) 




 I've heard this same thing too. To me they smell like talcum powder.  




 I know people that do this and aren't even a little embarassed about it. Like when people bring their babies into the office and the girl I'm talking about runs over and wants to sniff it. 

She says the baby smell makes you feel happy. I held the baby, the smell does nothing for me. Maybe I don't have the baby smell receptors.  




 Who the hell tricks someone into having kids?!?!?! Do they even care about their partner and what their life goals are? Clearly if the husband wanted kids, then a conversation would have happened and an agreement occurred, but if she had to go about it this way then it sounds like he didn't want them at all. :/ 




 I love blue heelers :) She's a lucky dog to have a caring owner like you. 




 I used to practice my conversational (small talk) skills with taxi drivers. I only live a short distance from my work so I'd try to work out what would be most likely to make them happy by the end of the trip. Taxi driving can be such a lonely job. 

For different people different topics worked. I usually tried to talk to them about what they do outside of taxi driving. Asking lots of questions, and asking how they got into it. etc. I couldn't relate well with everyone but it was great practice at small talk. 

I got to a point where I've gotten free taxi rides (they just chose not to charge me even after I insisted paying!) and a couple of times when I got out of the cab they thanked me for talking. 

At first I wasn't good at it but I got better over time. You can do this with anyone you talk to each day. Think of people who wouldn't mind having a conversation. Even newsagents don't mind if it's not a busy time of day. It's easy with taxis because they are trapped in the car with me ... muahahaha.  :)


As for being a good friend, well a friendship is a mutually beneficial thing. You give a little, they give a little and it's a mutual care for each other that makes it work. It doesn't always have to be balanced, but the knowledge that it's not a one sided affair matters. And being able to make time for them is important too. There's no point in having 100 friends who you can see each of one week in the year (which is the way it is when you are working). Having a couple of friends who you can invest time into being around and caring about is more fulfilling. You need to remember things about them that matter to them. For example, remember their birthday if that's important to them, or remember they told you about a vacation they were taking. You can ask about it, and be interested in their answer. An open and caring ear is often more valuable to people than many people realise. 




 Good on you for taking the time to improve yourself! There are so many things outside of work/study that can make your life better, and it's great that you have been able to spend the time working on it. 

I also need to learn to cook more food. I'm renovating the kitchen at the moment so when I get a new stove (my current stove is really crap - from the 60's), I am going to get a pressure cooker and try to prepare a few meals in advance so I'm not cooking every night like I am now.  




 Thanks. I really appreciate the encouragement. It means a lot to me. It was a huge decision to take the time off - one I wasn't sure about at first - but now nearing the end, I don't regret it one iota. :)  




 Thanks. I really appreciate your comment. It took me a while to give myself permission to take leave. At first I felt so guilty about taking unpaid leave, but I knew I needed the break. Quite a lot of people were supportive but a few others were quite critical of my decision.  

I think it's all too easy to focus a lot on getting good results from our activities at work, but a lot of the personal improvements in our skills and in our own lives come from investments into other activities outside of work. If your work takes over that other part of your life then it's only fair the other part of your life should get to take over for a while too. :) 




 I use it only as an online resume really.  




 Sure, send it through.  




 I never understood bagels until I recently had some really nice ones over in the states. They are so dense and much more moist than bread rolls. I have a craving for them now thinking about it.

If you're not interested in going and buying them I was reading about how to make them yourself. It is apparently not that difficult... if you like cooking and have the time and patience that is. I would probably try to buy them first too. :)  




 Well it was rude - the cousin probably should have written "of course you don't have to give a gift, and none is expected, but if you do want to there is a list available... blah". They clearly have a lack of manners, and at 16 they are probably still learning what is socially acceptable. But you're right, the response was a bit of an over the top reaction as well.

That said, I understand the response in a way because I know how often it can be hard as an outsider where you are able to have very little influence on the person compared to their immediate relatives who provide them with all the wrong role models and allow or even encourage bad habits and choices. You can grow frustrated with them and maybe even reduce your emotional investment. It would be frustrating if you'd tried to help and provide non-financial assistance and that fell on deaf ears and led to the situation, but now since they are pregnant at 16 they suddenly want your help (via your wallet). 

 




 I've heard colleagues at work say similar things - "Having a daughter/son changed my priorities in life". Basically they're telling me they don't give as much of a crap about work anymore because there's more important things (i.e. their child) in their life now. I mean that's great, and I agree that you should care about your kid, but like do you really want to be telling everyone at work that now work doesn't matter to you as much? To me it is still a pretty big part of my life, seeing as I work a minimum of 40 hours a week. So I feel almost like that statement is unintentionally diminishing my values.  




 I am actually doing exactly that right now. 

The first 2 weeks I spent recovering from the stress of my job   four major life events. At my job I was working in a high-stress role and the hours were generally 7 days a week, 12-18 hour days for about 4 months. So I was constantly stressed. Four people close to me in life passed away within the space of a couple of months. I got high blood pressure and I also ended up very very sick with a high fever for about 5 days. But... after two weeks into my leave my blood pressure dropped to high but within normal blood pressure range (still too high for my age though).

The next 6 weeks I spent travelling with my husband. It had always been my dream to go snowboarding in Canada - for about 16 years. One of the people who passed away was a close friend of mine at work - he was very young and healthy - so it was very unexpected. I decided I needed to do the things I had always wanted to do, and refused to put it off anymore. So we did it. It's something my husband wanted to do too so that was perfect. After I got back my blood pressure was within normal range (and healthy again yay!).

I've been back 2 months, and I have spent a lot of that time planning out the next steps. When I was working the long hours I never had a moment to myself to really think about what I wanted and to plan it out, I was just in survival mode only. I put everything else but work on hold, which meant everything else suffered. So now having spent some time processing everything, I have a plan. It took a lot of self reflection and investigation into opportunities but I have finally arrived. Before I was taking one day at a time and was following whatever path I was on, rather than deciding my own goals. Now I have a few goals in mind that I want to achieve. Some of those include technical certifications, looking at other job opportunities, buying a house, possibly considering moving overseas to work if the house thing falls through, prioritising my relationship and my health, learning about different investment options, deciding on our future. A lot of those I have started, but this is just the beggining, and it's something I plan to continue doing when I return to work.

I have one more month before going back to work. It's been an expensive exercise in taking the leave and travelling, but to me it has definitely been worthwhile and I consider it a personal investment. Now that I have goals I can take actions to help achieve them. I'm not too fussed if things don't turn out as planned, but without goals I feel as though it is too easy to stagnate and not improve your situation.   




 I have had problems with my nerves before presentations. I just build up a crazy amount of nervous energy. The same thing used to happen to me right before interviews for jobs I cared a lot about.

So things have improved drastically over the years.

A few years ago I used to get so nervous I would physically shake. So it took me a while but I worked out something to help me overcome it. One day before an interview I was so nervous that I felt like I needed to run, so I did about 5-10 minutes of intervals (sprinting). I know it's a bit unconventional but it worked for me. I think nerves are an outward expression of a fight or flight response, so if you can exert some of the nervous energy out of your body, then it could help. I felt like sprinting increased my heart rate, so then my heart could calm down and it had flow on effects over my body and mind. When I went to the interview, I didn't shake and I could control my body which made me feel more confident. I haven't heard of anyone else doing this but for me it works absolutely brilliantly. 

When doing presentations these days I only get nervous if I have to stand up at a podium. I'm fine sitting down and presenting to a boardroom, but standing at a podium sets me off. I think it's because if I'm sitting then I see people as my peers, but if I'm standing at a podium it's like I'm trying to be better than people and I'm really not comfortable with that. I find in this situation the best thing I can do is spend a lot of time preparing, and not the night before, in advance. If I can go to the venue before hand and stand up the front this helps too - because then it's not such a huge shock to my system when I am first stand up there. Recording and playing back my voice can help sometimes, but actually sometimes it just puts me off. If I can present my presentation there then that's even better - I've got less new things to focus on. So basically I try to eliminate as many new variables as possible so it's not as big a surprise to my senses. 

I also don't use slides with a lot of words. I use enough words to jog my memory but I try to present in a conversational tone. I try to talk to people as if they are my equals, even when I'm talking to students. I gave a lecture at university recently and the only difference between me and the students is different experiences, so if I think about them as my peers I find it a lot easier.

I hope that helps. I know people deal with things differently but the biggest change for me was the sprinting. If you can find some way to rid yourself of some of your nervous energy I think it helps. 




 For me the key has been to to actively forgive myself. 

For me I find it useful to talk to myself in my head as if I'm talking to a stranger. 

For example, let's say I had an awkward conversation today and I didn't respond to the other person properly and I got a weird look and also stunted the conversation. I might go home and think about how stupid I am not to be able to converse properly and make a fool out of myself. 

Then I say as if talking to myself "Ok yeah that wasn't the best response. But it's okay. In the grand scheme of their day it is probably really minor and they probably aren't even thinking about it anymore. I forgive you (talking to yourself) for making that mistake. It's okay, you're human and everyone has silly moments."

Even just saying to yourself "I forgive you" encompasses a lot. It's first about acknowledging the error, but accepting that it's happened and can't be undone. And second it's about absolving you of the guilt of the error, and removing the burden of self punishment.  

Of course if it's something major this probably isn't relevant. But I'm talking about those every day things that I beat myself up about. 




 I'm in IT and I'd be happy to look at your CV. Shoot it over.  




 Have you thought about getting a casual job? Maybe it would be good to get out of the house a bit. 




 I guess I should spend time making myself more presentable. I don't know exactly when I stopped caring as much, but I only do what needs to be done and don't take pride in my appearance anymore. 

I also need to do things other people said - eat healthier, exercise more, go to bed at reasonable hours (oh yeah it's 1am... go me!), learn things outside of work, have motivation to do these things... 




 I dunno... I mean it's Parramatta Park - it gets pretty dark in there. And Parramatta.

 The thing I'm looking forward to is walking down George Street and it actually being a pleasant place to be, rather than having to get off the main street as quickly as possible and yelling to talk to your friends, because you have to compete with the bus noise. 

I get the bus most days and would be okay to get light rail (I used to get the light rail sometimes), except I hope they don't put those shitty old carriages on the new light rail. They really suck, and give me motion sickness. The old carriages are so much better.
 




 We have a lot of expats at my work and they all send most of their stuff by shipping. I guess they have a lot of stuff. Usually they do it in advance before leaving here. I think you can get insurance too. 

There is some good advice on this Whirlpool thread:

 I can read stuff for you and record it. I reckon you should also get an Australian to listen to a recording of yourself doing an Australian accent, and give you feedback on any particular words that sound odd. 




 Try looking for screen printing shops. They should be able to print on t-shirts and hoodies.

 It might have! I have pretty good eyesight. Better than most people, so that old wives tale might very well be true! :) 




 I think it's not often that really big storms hit the city center. It's the first time since I've been living in the city since 2007 that I've had a really bad storm here. We had hail once but this time trees and powerlines fell down around here. 




 My parents own a house on the riverfront down there in Picnic Point. The last one we really remember was 1986. But our house is built to flood standards so it doesn't affect us that much plus we're further downstream than Milperra.

 Cooked fish eyeballs. When I was a kid I'd swallow them whole to annoy/freak out my sisters and cause a stir. They don't actually taste like anything, so it's ok. Been a long time since I've eaten one though. Not that keen nowadays.  




 Ohhh, yes, that's just cruel and unusual punishment otherwise. My tummy is rumbling thinking about all those things.  




 Why is that evil? Maybe they are really old and not as fresh now so require toasting, I mean Easter was a while ago. Or are you more just jealous of not having some for yourself? 




 And the air is cleaner!
