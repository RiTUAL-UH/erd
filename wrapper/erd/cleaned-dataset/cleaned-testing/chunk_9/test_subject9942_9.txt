 examples of these are:

-that feminist will brand men as rapists and that includes asexual males
-makes assumptions that male asexuals are white knights or doing nice things for 'rewards'
-a lot of women have attacked me for both of these things
-asexuals are misogynists for not necessarily liking a woman (extended from men who don't date women are misogynists, as if gay doesn't exist)
- and many more examples

 she doesn't have to ult to get a kill 




 Both marry, be respectful to one another, basic things?, know the basic life skills like cook or fix things 









 I thought you mean trophies (like heads of animals over a fireplace)

but yea, it is somewhat bothering. But I guess as long as they ethically treat the animal right, then I wouldn't have so much as a problem.

 because men and women are different biologically: physiologically and psychologically
and some of these gender roles were vital to survival

we also do have androgynous guidelines, do we not? 




 I believe gender roles are guidelines, not rigid structures

I wouldn't know what to do without gender roles giving me some guidance
