 Glad I viewed that on public transport! 




 Not quite, but Sports Direct are interested in buying out this particular store. 




 I don't think we do, but there's a store called Next that is infamous for its "sales". They actually put out entirely different stock than normal and say it's on offer, for some reason people go mental for this particular sale and queue up for hours before they open. It's like a mini Black Friday. 




 I think I heard somewhere that the products have to have been sold at the "was" price within the last 6 months. There are so many damn loopholes though I'm sure they'll get away with it, just like that DFS one.  




 I know of a store that has had a "sale" on for over 6 months now. People think they're making huge savings and it pisses me off so much cos the price has never actually been reduced. 

In fact, does anyone know if this legal in the UK? I'd love for Trading Standards to stumble across this one.

 




 Urge to nap beats this every time. Regret follows every time.  




 Hi everyone,

My name is Josh and am the current Vice President of Membership at Reading Speakers Club. The club is part of an international speaking organisation called Toastmasters International (NOT the guys in the red coats, don't worry) and we're always on the look out for new members who want to improve their public speaking/leadership skills in a safe, supportive environment.

I personally joined the club last year and I can't believe the progress that I've made in such a short time - 9 months ago I was on the verge of being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but thanks to the confidence I gained at this club I'm now happier than ever. Its a very rare thing for a person to make permanent and genuine change in themselves, but every month I witness more and more people growing in confidence and becoming truly talented speakers at this club.

I just wanted to put the word out there that this club exists, as it is not always well publicised. Our next meeting is at 7:30pm, Monday 6th July at Salisbury Conservative Club (near Cemetery Junction).

Please feel free to come along as a guest and see if this club is for you. It's a great group of people who are all really fun, supportive and willing to go the extra mile to help you. 

PM me for more details or visit the website https://www.toastmasters.org/
 




 Fellow plane viewer here! Unfortunately I watched it on the way back from Australia and it made me want to book more travelling straight away, wish I'd seen it on the way out! 




 Got a one line email from head office saying "Good job" though. Worth it!  




 Two main reasons in this case. 1. This guy steals as a business and is a regular around my town, he'll head out with a list of requests and then sell them on to his buyers. 2. I was really fucking bored on that shift and I couldn't resist the adrenaline rush! 




 I stopped a shoplifter the other week and haven't stopped telling everyone about it, if I'd saved hundreds of kids you'd never heard the end of it. 




 I tend to get that with international students a lot who couldn't afford to do one at home. Always a bit of an awkward situation as somebody was convinced they'd spotted a tumour in their scan once and we got an angry phone call from their GP asking why we gave pictures out. 

It was nothing more than a spot of hypochondria though! 




 Mission accepted, I will report back to you!
RemindMe! One year "Are you big yet?" 




 Can confirm that we do this at Universities. However it's unlikely you'll be given much information about your brain, also there's no way we can tell how many neurons you'd have. Still, it's cool to have a picture :)

If by some crazy coincidence you're near Reading University in the UK, pm me and I'll set you up! 




 173lbs? Damn I wish so wasn't so lanky, I'd look great if my weight wasn't stretched over  4 miles of gangly limbs! 




 Read this as "human torch". I'm glad you're not a psychopath.
