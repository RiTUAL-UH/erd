 Many of these animals that PETA picks up don't get to the shelter. Around 1% of the animals are adopted ... most shelters have much better rates than this

 SR has a couple of goals. Standing up against illegal extremism (which represents only a very tiny minority of the AR movement - but one with a disproportional voice) and standing up against misinformation. The second action IS needed, as there is much distortion of the science. 

The slow down in medicine is happening. Only a few airlines will continue to transport primates - used for vital medical research (and only where other animals would not be suitable). This prevents some research going on, and raises the cost of research - reducing the amount of it.
Activists broke into Marshall breeding facility and took the animals. Raising the cost of research, reducing it.
Activists are protesting the movement of the AZ dogs - if they managed, AZ would simply end up breeding more, and having to put them through the same processes - this does not make "better" research, or "better" animal welfare.

Now, we need to be sure not to underestimate the importance of animal welfare. There are many working towards this. Some push is from the AR movement, some from the animal welfare movements (e.g. RSPCA), most is from the animal welfare officers within the labs. I had the job of looking round a lab the other day, and you should see the pride from the NACWO (Named animal care and welfare officer) of the primate lab discuss all the systems he has in place. The importance of diet, group housing, horizontal bars and viewing platforms in the enclosures, and mostly good training of the animals to reduce their environmental and handling stresses. 




 Brandon, thank you for your reply.

We are indeed all on the same side in both wishing for further medical advances and wishing for the continued development of alternative methods. The 3Rs, developed by two scientists in the 50s, have been the cornerstone of animal welfare - aiming for the refinement, replacement and reduction of animal research (something we should all agree on).
There are some promising technologies in the pipeline that should replace some bits of animal research (lung-on-a-chip is a more recent one), however there is no sign of technologies that can replace all of animal use for medical research, nor is there a sign that new areas won't continue to be developed with a need for animal use.

This link was aimed at informing people on both sides (it was also posted elsewhere) as to how projects are taken from being an idea to a study.

You are right when you say scientifically minded people should go with the best results, and then add a healthy dose of leaning against animal use. However, you cannot get a project approved if there are alternative methods available. In the UK that is checked by the Home Office, in the US it is checked by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 




 There is a lot of work in labs aimed at ensuring animal welfare remains high.

 You don't need to convince me off UKIP - I would never vote for them. Nonetheless, I agree with the workfare program - we have a terrible prison system with ridiculously high reoffending rates - something has to change. Japan probably moves too far away from human rights in its prison system (e.g. no conjugal visits destroys families), but there must be lessons we can learn from them.

Scrapping CPS, human rights etc - that's terrifying and one of the many reasons I would not vote UKIP. 




 I hasten to add that I am not a fan of UKIP, but I feel what was written above on prisons wasn't telling the whole story 




 With regards to inmates doing physical work, I don't think they have prison labour for military efforts in mind.
I'm not sure whether I agree with it, but Japan has very strict prisons, all inmates must work long days, and more importantly they have very, very low reoffending rates.

 Good point 














 I confess under normal circumstances I loathe to link to the Mail. It's not high quality science writing, but the article was interesting and reasonably well explained and I've provided the original paper below for people's perusal. 




 For those who are asking for it - here is the original paper:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22654062 




 What the hell?!

1. Lib Dems are not a minority party (smallest of the 3 major parties)
2. The major vote wasn't split between Tories and Labour, Labour got almost no vote
3. If there was a straight run off between Tories and Lib Dems, the Lib Dems would have won it- they have much more support in the area 




 Good question - I guess the next stage of trials will work that out. 




 The veterinarian has rehomed the breeding dogs. The rest would not be suitable for rehoming on the decision of the vet.

It would also mean the same beagles would just have to be bred again in the UK - which is against the idea of reduction of animal research. 














 Would you rather own bank or charing cross branch? 
























 hopefully 









 Government's still borrow when in surplus if cheap credit is available. Also, money comes at certain points in the year (when taxes are due) so they often borrow at one point in the year and repay later on. 




 There are two potential risks (I won't say they will or won't happen because economics is unpredictably complex much of the time).

- Firstly, a fast rise in government spending involves the government borrowing from abroad and from markets. Essentially this can absorb all the available cheap credit which really need to go to firms - so firms have little money to invest. This is called "crowding out" of investment.

- Secondly, deficit's must have a credible repayment plan. If you don't then the markets lose  faith and your borrowing rates skyrocket - this results in huge chunks of money going into repayment each year. This is what happened to Greece and Italy last year (and almost France). Compared with the UK, which in its tight-fisted austerity, maintained market trust for repayment, so credit remained cheap. This credibility not only affects governments, but can have a knock on effect to bank and company borrowing. 




 You should absolutely take account of the authors interest, but unless you can criticise what he says, that's not enough to dismiss it. 

The author accepts the findings of the original paper, but suggests that the NYT article overstates what is contained in the sources. 




 BUAV argue the government promised to reduce animal research - what was meant was within the principle of the 3Rs.

There has been huge increases in expenditure on alternatives - most obviously seen by the fact that money into biomedicine has gone much much faster than the use of animals (thus most money is going into non-animal methods). 




 Yup! 




 Also worth noting that arbitrary reduction of animal research across the board (rather than individual experiments) is that it just pushes it overseas 









 Little bit sweeping. Some vegans (at best - most seem to just prefer to say companion animal and then treat them like a pet). 

Anyhow, you're dodging the question. Let me go another way - Do you get rid of a threadworm infection?

 I understand that, but sometimes it seems a little "tacked on". The "it's unethical, and even if it was ethical it doesn't work".

However, the scientific arguments against animal research just don't seem to add up - as many of the debunked articles in the link above 




 Hmmm, seems like the counter to the "33 facts of vivisection" ... still a few more to debunk 




 Then this discussion should hold no interest for you. Prof. Lovell-Badge's article was meant to dispute those activists who were misusing that statistic for their own argument. You were not.  




 It's a scary world when activists can hold medicine to ransom. 




 In Full: bacon, sausages, bakes beans (with mini sausages in), mushrooms, cheese and scrambled eggs 









 all drugs must be tested on animals - so difficult to find 




 They use the first argument a lot - the statistic is often quoted as "92%". The latter stat could never be tested, it would be unethical to give a treatment which killed animals to humans. 




 The UK has had a ban for years, Europe has just fallen suit. Hopefully the US will settle on a set of alternative tests that will satisfy regulators (they are getting there). It does make it difficult to use novel chemicals in new cosmetics, but honestly, we don't need new lipsticks at the cost of animals. 

I support animal research for medicine, but I'm all for dumping both cosmetic testing and the LD50 tests (who cares about the dosage that kills 50% of mice - The LD10 would show a dosage that's too high). 




 no data - it would unethical to move forward a drug shown to be dangerous in animals 




 read the post - the 9/10 refers to a specific "fact" 




 To my mind negative rights always entail a duty. My right to life entails a duty not to kill, and so does yours - the result is that neither of us kills one another. When it comes to those who can't think for themselves, such as babies, society deems it right to extend that right as they have the potential to fulfill their duty later on. Similarly, those in a vegatative state have a potential to get better. 

An animal will never be able to understand the duties entailed by their rights. 




 cosmetic testing is banned in the UK - which is a good thing 




 Of which 17% turn out to be precisely true upon review 




 The TGN1412 disaster has been the only situation where anyone has even nearly died in Stage I clinical trials that I can name. 




 dfgb - go and google "Drug Monkey" and "anti-vaccination" and you will have all the science debunking your claims written clearly and scientifically. 









 Ah, in the situation of rights-duties, the word "duty" has a rather grander meaning than in casual conversations. 




 A human cannot appeal to its rights when dealing with another animals - the other animal doesn't understand. Rights exist to mediate human-to-human interaction - it is meaningless across species.

Rights are an expansion of the golden rule - if you don't do this to me, I won't do it to you.  




 It's amazing seeing the improvements in mouse models in the field of neuroscience 




 Children DO have a right to education, thus the state has a DUTY to provide it.

Responsibility is an alternative to rights. So a painting of the Mona Lisa has, itself, no rights - nonetheless society deems we have responsibility to look after it. 









 I disagree, it is there to mock this idea that animal research is some terrible cruelty when the reality is that it is tightly regulated and far more humane than anything that goes on in nature.

If it is about how we expect humans to act towards animals then it is a responsibility not a right - rights entail duties which an animal cannot carry out. 




 Is there a shorthand for saying that? Do I use [OC]? Still new to Reddit 









 I suppose that's a small advantage to this mass bird-kill 









 Thanks for the support - it's great to see scientists, veterinarians and technicians start to speak up on this complex issue. 




 You'll note that deaths in Stage I clinical trials are almost unheard of. Certainly no deaths in the UK for the past 30 years and only one major incident (TGN1412). So animal research remains a crucial step to protecting people.

Secondly, most animal research is not for testing drugs, it is for developing drugs and in that stage it is crucial. You can't cut up a human to see how a disease is spreading or how it works. How would you get a breakthrough medicine like the HPV vaccine (against cervical cancer) which is originally a mouse protein - without the use of animals? 



















 Why? It's a fun way of looking at the scientific debunking of many animal rights claims

 Nice story 




 Activists have been breaking into anial labs and stealing animals. Politicians seem reluctant to step in, instead moving science policy away from animal research. Researchers had a rally to try and explain to the public the importance of such research. 

Pro-Test Italia ran the rally on a shoestring rally, and from what I've spoken to them, received no money from any pharmaceutical or university 









 This one?

 Didn't Lord Prof Winston suggest labelling all medicine (in the UK) with "has been tested on animals".

 It's derived from Crowley's paper stating only 0.004% of research has clinical use. 




 So parents who are more skeptical of modern medicine are also more skeptical of all proper medicine? No surprise. 




 True. Here's an online version of Crick and Watson: http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf 




 Is there a similar paper that's more recent? 




 Prof Lovell Badge has done other great debunkings of these sort of statistical myths:

 So people like Andrew Wakefield should be able to make up stats to put in the discussion about the benefits of vaccination? Those falsehoods killed people. 














 It's another myth that's done its rounds - so definitely right to be skeptical 














 That is a ridiculous video. It takes footage from what looks to be 30-40 years ago. The video says clinical investigation is "the ONLY valid kind" - how exactly are you going to discover the patterns of disease, or which treatment works without clear large number of very similar patients and control groups (so as to have scientific rigour).

"Any disease which is provoked is unlike any disease which arrives spontaneously". WHAT?! We have treated many diseases successfully by creating models - that is the principle of biological science.

There are so many factual errors throughout that video 




 Their claim personalised medicine will replace animal experiments
Their claim that animal research is non-predictive
Their claim that human and veterinary medicine are unconnected

All pseudoscientific nonsense, and the post deals with most of those points. 




 The mouse study is interesting. It does show significant failings of mouse models for three conditions. It's a good peer reviewed paper. 
Note the paper doesn't suggest to stop using animals, it says we need to improve the models. Read this specific reply to the paper in question:
http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/02/15/why-mice-may-succeed-in-research-when-a-single-mouse-falls-short/ 




 teklord - you should visit a lab. They are not like the 70s videos you watch online. They are not tortured, research is always done under anaesthetic unless there is a VERY clear reason why this shouldn't be the case (usually because the procedure itself is milder than the anaesthetic injection, such as a blood draw or a breeding experiment).

And what is a failed experiment? If something doesn't work, you learn something, modify your actions, and try again.

In terms of enslaving humans you should read this: http://speakingofresearch.com/2011/12/06/the-gorgons-visit-earth/ 









 The article you sight shows limitations of some animal models - it also suggests these models are improved not binned. See this article: http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/02/15/why-mice-may-succeed-in-research-when-a-single-mouse-falls-short/ 




 The computer models generally come from the animals. When computer models improve it is because of animal research - so they are unlikely to replace animal models but rather to complement it.

No model is perfect (I am not a perfect biological model for you), but we use a variety of techniques in tandem (including in vitro, computer models, DNA chips, human skin cells, (etc) AND animal models) to get the best results. 




 Also note that Vioxx passed human clinical trials to show it was safe. Yes it passed animal trials (which were much smaller than the subsequent human trials which is why they were less likely to show the side effect which affected around 1 in 400 patients), but it also passed human trials. It is the exception to the rule where a dangerous drug makes it through all tests (incidentally these would have included in vitro and computer models). 




 What on earth makes you think most are killed instantly. A mouse might be hit by a stone knocked by a thresher, or might get just its leg hit by the blade. It crawls underground and waits to die - no anaesthetic (mandatory unless special reasons not to in most western labs), no food, no water, no safety 




 The original papers dealing with aspirin and birth defects rabbits involved huge overdoses of aspirin to rabbits (1). The same is likely to be the same with humans (humans can certainly overdose on aspirin), with some anecdotal evidence (2), but large scale studies would not be ethical.

 The article isn't an argument for animal research - it was never intentioned as such - this is why it doesn't have any arguments for research in it. It's about the relationship between animal-use movements.

In regards to your argument:
- No billions of animals are not bought yearly. It is likely to number about 100 million (that's the estimate from animal rights groups). 
- I can't talk for research in lesser developed countries, but in the US and EU research can only take place when the researcher can show there was no other method that would work and that the benefit outweighs the cost - so not "pointless experimentation". 
- Our genetic differences are far overwhelmed by our genetic similarities. This can be even closer when you look at genetically modified mice which have humanised genes. You should also note that humans are not genetically identical (far from it) yet you would not argue that human tests work. 
- Human skin cultures are a brilliant development and are widely used - but cannot tell you about how organs react, or how drugs move through the body, or their mechanisms of action - they are limited and are used alongside animal experiments.

 The difference being that continuing to use the product of knowledge from the holocaust doesn't perpetuate such research. Continuing to use the benefits of animal research does.

 Apparently the method they used to improve the vaccine might be relevant to the polio vaccine 





























  or better dexterit

Might try that. I de-set the kit a few weeks back, it's cased up and waiting to be set up in my new house (will be re-skinning as well). The Zil-Bel I might return to putting it on top of the china (felt, china, felt, zil-bel, felt, wingnut). 

I have a pearl icon rack in the picture, but too many things to rack everything (it already carried the four high toms and most of the cymbals). 

You're correct on the china - I only use the tip on the right hand one. I could invert the left one, not sure if there is much advantage though.

 




 The bass drum of my Roland TD-8 has become quite unresponsive sometimes - any tips for making it work properly again? 




 Remember flams are ultimately used for accent. Little things like "bass-bass-flam" work well inside longer fills. Or starting fills around the tom's on a flam (or ending on one).  




 Total agreement here. I haven't gigged in a few years - so the kit has grown. If I got a band back together (which I intend to do now I'm building myself a music room in my basement) then I'll probably go down to 3 toms, 2-3 crashes, ride, hi-hats, snare and bass drum. 




 Would like to get a picollo snare for the left of the hi-hat 




 A bit of it is perspective. The four crashes are almost touching each other. Their height is eye level, which suits me well. Perhaps this picture will make it a bit easier to see:
http://i.imgur.com/mll48ib.jpg
The smallest roto-tom is awfully positioned, but it was either keep it there and balance the other two, or just remove it - it doesn't get in the way even if it is almost untouchable. Agree with your point though.

12" drum is perspective again, you could almost put a ruler along the top three toms and it would lie on all the skins. 

China's are actually the normal way round - but many people prefer them upside down. I don't - since I often play them with the stick tip in the middle. 
Floor tom's are touching, but there is a cramping issue which is why the 16" tom is a little too far to the right for comfort. 

Appreciate the thoughts though. 




 Hehe, I bought some Quick beats a few years back and sold them within a week. I do like my New Beats - had them for about 10 years. 




 Perhaps buy better sticks. Otherwise watch the technique. Swipe the cymbals rather than "slapping" them. Let your fingers and wrists bounce your strikes off your skins (and don't angle the drums to sharply). Go for accuracy on rimshots not power (i.e. to hit rim and skin perfectly together) 




 It's probably the cymbals I'm most careful with. I used to invert the 14" China, but changed back a while ago.  




 When I've played small venues I've been loud enough to hear over the band un miced
If I've played a bigger venue they've tended to mic the drumkit out of course. 
You can play loud without breaking sticks. Hitting cymbals in a swiping motion, keeping hands and wrists supple on skins, and going for accuracy rather than power in your rim shots. 
If you hit the kit too loud you'll just dull the sound of the drums/cymbals. 




 Good technique, particularly on cymbals, and you can get a big noise without damaging your sticks. Saves money too. 




 Yeah I like to have it so I can use the tip or shaft of my sticks. I've only broken one stick in 15 years of playing.  




 The 16" Tom is in an awkward position. If I'm running round the tom's or playing I tend to turn towards it, but I use the 14" floor tom much more.

The small roto-tom is the only thing there almost impossible to hit due to the hi-hat rod. I keep it on the kit to help balance the bigger roto-tom on the bar that holds all 3. I need to find a solution to that.

 Moreover. Teachers are underpaid. Overworked. And the government in the UK is constantly berating them accusing them of not working hard enough. They are regarded as mid-level jobs. Why should top students be teachers as we set the system up now?

 Here is the ridiculous EDM: http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2013-14/263 


































 According to The Times article, the drug Cisplatin (who anti-tumour properties were discovered in mice) 
























 Good question 




 It comes from Taiwan's animated news network NMA. 














 The stats are not remotely related. It's like saying that First year TFA turnover is close to 0%.

Find the stats for retention of teachers after their first two years in a single school and you'll probably find it remarkably similar to the TFA. Lots of teachers want to move on after 2-3 years to find another school with new challenges.  




 Certainly graduating from an Ivy league doesn't automatically make you a better/worse teacher - but these are top graduates who have got into top schools and these kids can benefit from that. 

First year TFA teachers are ill equipped to go into the classroom, nonetheless studies in Louisana showed TFA'ers were "statistically significantly more effective":
http://www.nctq.org/docs/TFA_Louisiana_study.PDF
There are various other state studies as well. 

Now you point out cost, which is an issue - especially when long standing teachers experience is sorely needed (and as noted, TFA'ers often have lower retention). I do think some schools do pick TFA'ers as a cheap option. 














 Can you evidence the idea that 86% (100-14) of new traditional teachers stay at their initial placement for more than 2 years. That stat wasn't in the link you provided. 

Also, there is higher turnover at high poverty schools where TFA'ers go. 




 Why wouldn't we want the most able students to go into teaching? They weren't going so much by traditional routes. 




 When I started, around 60-90 hours

Before I quit it was more like 40-60 




 The evidence that the Swedish model is not all it was cracked up to be is making Michael Gove (Education Sec) follow the Singaporean system. This is a bad move. If there was a model to follow it is the Finnish, who don't test their students until 18

 The options are in the link but:

1 First chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease

Scientists at the University of Leicester developed a compound that stopped brain cell death occurring in neurodegenerative diseases in mice. Resulting medicines could be used to treat Alzheimers, Parkinsons, Huntingdons and other diseases, although researchers were keen to stress that more work would be needed to develop a drug that could be taken by patients.

2 An experimental gene therapy treatment cured haemophilia in dogs

Two out of three dogs given an experimental gene therapy treatment for haemophilia remained free of the disease more than two years following treatment. A condition that naturally affects both dogs and around one in every 10,000 men, haemophilia is caused by a genetic defect that researchers targeted using a virus to carry the normal gene. Researchers have applied for permission to carry out a clinical trial in the next two years.

3 Ovarian stimulation developed in mice leads to successful human pregnancy

An ovary stimulation technique originally pioneered in mice has allowed a previously infertile woman to give birth. The ovaries are removed and stimulated to produce eggs in vitro by reducing the activity of the Hippo pathway, which normally prevents overgrowth of the ovarian tissue.

4 Mice can lose their innate fear of cats through parasitic infection

Mice can permanently lose their fear of cats following exposure to the Toxoplasma gondii parasite. Infected mice show no physical symptoms, but did not show an aversion to cat urine, unlike their uninfected counterparts. Toxoplasma can be transferred to humans, and this study raises concerns about the long-term neurological damage that toxoplasma and other bacterial infections might have.

5 Simple molecule prevents mole rats from getting cancer

The naked mole rat appears to be completely immune to cancer, thanks to the excessive quantities of hyaluronic acid produced by their fibroblasts. Hyaluronic acid is a long chain sugar molecule that they suspect may form a tight cage around early-stage tumour cells, preventing pre-cancers from proliferating.

6 Nerve grafts let paralysed rats pee again

A nerve graft applied to a severed spinal cord has restored up to two thirds of bladder function in rats. After six months the rats were still unable to walk, but could urinate unaided. Both the bacterial enzyme and nerve grafts have been successfully used in humans before, meaning that nerve graft treatments for spinal cord injuries might not be a far off possibility.

7 Scientists grow tiny liver in a mouse

Scientists successfully grew tiny liver buds using human stem cells, and transplanted into mice delayed death in individuals with liver failure. They even began to take on a range of liver functions such as protein secretion. After transplantation the liver buds attached themselves to nearby blood vessels and continued to grow.

8 False memory planted in mouses brain

Scientists implanted a false memory in the brains of mice in an experiment that they hope will shed light on the well-documented phenomenon whereby people "remember" events or experiences that have never happened.

9 Dual-action drug shows promise against diabetes

An experimental type II diabetes drug reduced blood sugar levels in humans, monkeys and rodents. The unnamed molecule seems likely to cause fewer side-effects in humans than current medications for the disease. In mouse studies researchers found that long-term treatment at a higher dose lead to significant weight loss; obese mice receiving the highest doses lost 19% of their body weight in just one week.

10 UK firm seeks to market world's first malaria vaccine

GlaxoSmithKline are seeking regulatory approval for the worlds first Malaria vaccine after a successful African trial involving over 15,000 children in seven countries. In children aged 5-17 months the vaccine caused a 46% reduction in the risk of clinical malaria compared to unvaccinated children.

 I'm not disagreeing with evolution - but there is a difference between philosophical and scientific proof. 

Philosophical proof is fundamentally different. The problem is that very little obeys its strict rules for proof - a few examples are: 
- Mathematics - all obeys philosophical rigour to be proof. So 2+2=4 is proven.
- *Cogito Ergo Sum* - I think therefore I am, it is proof for the existence of a thinking thing (most people agree a thinking self)
- Logic - If all swans are black then the next swan I see must be black. If you accept the premise you must accept the conclusion.

The problem with scientific proof is it is open to questions. Near all scientific proof relies on induction:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning 




 http://www.darwinconspiracy.com/

DISCLAIMER: Everything in the above link is bull**** I'm just showing that some crazy people think evolution is a conspiracy. 




 I was half joking, but like most scientific theories, it has a huge body of evidence rather than proof. Of course the theory is true - but by burden of evidence rather than a philosophical proof.

That's the nature of empirical based evidence, rather than, say, mathematical proof.

 As a teacher I would be very concerned about my child not going to university. It doesn't prevent them being a success, but it does close doors that would remain open if they did a degree (many jobs are for graduates only). 

I suppose if they had a very clear alternative plan then I would accept it, and I might urge them to take a gap year beforehand, but I do think that I would push them to applying to university (they don't have to accept the place). 




 Imagine you have an 18 year old child. They said they didn't really want to apply to university. Would you accept their decision, or would you badger them into applying?

 Considering drums tend to support a band, the time signature bottom end does matter.

 I didn't offer any objection - its the original title.  














 So put the praise chart near the door and give people ticks as they start to do the starter - others should catch on quickly 




 Positive praise charts - they work for all ages but you have to persist for a few weeks.

Everyone's name down one side, a tick for everything good (might be sitting down and starting the starting activity quietly - might be good homework etc.) Give lots of ticks and praise loudly. 
5 ticks = positive postcard home to parents
10 ticks = positive phonecall home to parents

Be warned - they will pretend not to care at first. This does not mean they don't care.

Other aspects to look at is how you start your class - are you standing by the door greeting them. Is there a starting activity they can get on with before everyone has arrived? If they are roudy as they come in, don't let them enter - they need to wait until they are calm and quiet before coming in. 














 Try a positive praise chart. Those who remain quiet, or make big improvements in their quietness are publicly praised and get a tick. When they get 5 ticks they get a postcard home. When they get 10 ticks they get a phonecall home. etc.

 Not a particularly light hitter. For the last coupole of years it's not been used much, but if you went back 4-5 years it was in use every day.  
























 TFA don't reject the idea that poverty (etc) are crucial to student outcomes, but they believe that good teachers can mitigate this issue - which studies back up.

e.g.
http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/w19424.pdf
"Using school district and tax records for more than one million children, we nd that students assigned to high-[Value Added] teachers in primary school are more likely to attend college, earn higher salaries, live in higher SES neighborhoods, and have higher savings rates"

There are many other studies and they do control for factors such as parental education, location, poverty etc.

Parents wages are the biggest determinant of a child's outcomes, but this can be mitigated by good teaching.  




 I'd be curious to see the evidence that most TFA teachers are ineffective. The latest study I've found, from 2013, says:
TFA teachers were more effective than the teachers with whom they were compared. On average, students assigned to TFA teachers scored 0.07 standard deviations higher on end-of-year math assessments than students assigned to comparison teachers, a statistically significant difference. This impact is equivalent to an additional 2.6 months of school for the average student nationwide. 
http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20134015/pdf/20134015.pdf 









 I can't speak on many of the points you raise, but as someone who taught for 3 years under the British equivalent - Teach First - I can offer some opinions.

I do worry about very TF heavy schools - I think that TF'ers get better by taking advantage of the experience of more established teachers. 

I do think students can lose - to an extent. For the first 4-6 months I was an appalling teacher - I let down my students and I felt awful about it. My solution was to work longer and longer hours planning, only to arrive exhausted to teach my overprepared lesson. However, the same is true (in the UK) of many going into teaching through other routes. Most teachers in the UK do a standard PGCE where they spend a few months at uni and a school helping another teacher, then slowly taking over classes - many of them are not good teachers. In my experience, when you compared a TF'er and a PGCSE'er after one year, the TF'er was a hands down better teacher. They were in a much better situation in year two when the PGCSE teacher had entirely his own classes, and the TF'er had done so for a year.

The training isn't enough to make anyone a good teacher at the start, and if TFA is anything like TF training, then it isn't meant to be. It's about giving you the evaluating tools, and the legal knowledge to go into a school. TF'ers are expected to teach themselves to teach - by watching, reflecting and evaluating. 

It is true many leave to go into other careers, I left after 3 years (2 years being the TF mandatory course). The drop out rates in the UK are similar to that of other training routes for teachers. I actually think teachers doing other things is a good thing - I want people who have been in a classroom leading businesses and political institutions - with the will and understanding to make a change in education.

TF/TFA isn't all good, but it certainly isn't all bad - and I think it has a place in modern education.

 Very misleading title. Perrin was clear that mouse models could be improved and that the errors were fundamentally not applying basic scientific principles to certain animal studies, resulting in errors. See what Perrin actually wrote in Nature:

 Well both signalling (Spence) and human capital (Becker) are relevant. Your Harvard degree certificate signals you are a high achieving, high skill employer - it no doubt gets you the interview. 

If you are entirely fraudulent in your degree, there is a good chance you lack the human capital needed for the job, and you would not get it. If you do have the skills necessary, it will still come down to part-luck on whether YOU get it rather than someone else similar (because Signalling theory relies on the idea that you cannot accurately gauge human capital in an easy manner - it is very costly to do so). 




 Worth noting the Speaking of Research website (second link) is probably more accurate than the one before it since they FOI'ed the USDA for the 2012 stats, whereas the first website is using those from 2010.

 Please can I get some help buying some speakers for both music and TV. Budget - up to 300 including speaker stands.

I already have: Technics SU-C800U pre-amp Technics SE-A800S amp (these can be upgraded in the future) 

Inputs are 1) CD player, 2) Boxee Box phono jacks (into pre-amp)

Someone suggested I go a slightly "different" way and use Rokit RP5 Active Monitors (thus bypassing the amp completely). Thoughts? or other suggestions?

 My parents got a new TV and gave them their old one. It's a big upgrade from 37" to 50"  




 It's the only way I can get it to work. 









 The reality is they do. They have had success in preventing Google and Microsoft abusing their dominant position. They are forcing mobile phone companies to drop roaming charges. 

There will always be abuses by multinationals you can point to, but the EU has a better chance of managing it than the UK alone. 




 Except that the EU regulations are the same throughout - so when 50% of the trade must meet one set of regulations it's better to have influence on those standards than not. 

The WTO has almost nothing to do with the nature of the regulations and important criteria unless someone is actually putting up protectionist tariffs. The 8% vote isn't the only issue here - it's the seat at the table to discuss it. The vote simply gives you some clout so people will listen.

TTIP would make the world $600 billion better off - you would be a fool to reject it. The faster we abolish most if not all the special protection cases the better. It's stalled because of the political deadlock in the US. 

Finally, don't make up stuff about what the EU can and cannot do. The reality is that it HAS suspended talks on Swiss participation in Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020 (worth 80 billion) because of Switzerland blocking the free flow of labour.

Study economics, rather than a UKIP leaflet, you will be more qualified to have this debate. 









 I think you misunderstand - the EU has no interest in trade sanctions against the UK for leaving. The problem is that many goods imported into the EU must meet certain regulations - the UK currently has influence over what those criteria are - if we left we would lose that. We would lose any benefits accrued from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the US (estimated benefit of $600 billion to trade). 

Switzerland abides by EU regulations but cannot shape them. Look at what happened recently with the Swiss trying to prevent the free flow of people into Switzerland from other EU countries - this is likely to result in both EU sanctions and Switzerland's expulsion from the fairly lucrative Erasmus programme.  




 Because we would have just left the one organisation big and powerful enough to take on the multinationals - the EU. 




 Which would be great, except that China accounts for 3.38% of Switzerland's exports and the EU accounts for 50% 




 I agree with 1. I think the second point is that he is giving the Lib Dems a unique selling point in being the only clearly pro-EU party (since Labour are pandering to both sides, and Tories are stuck in internal politicking)

Cameron doesn't stand a chance in creating a "new deal" - why would the EU let him. Half of UK trade is with the EU, we rely on them.  




 Switzerland has to abide by most of the EU trade rules (in order to conduct its trade) and can do nothing to influence them. Not a great deal. 




 As has been mentioned with cold reading, expect to hear opposites which cover all bases. e.g.

 yes ... yes it is 



















 This made me chuckle. While I agree about less bias in the UK, I wouldn't have picked the Daily Mail as my example (they are a terribly biased paper) - though I do agree with the article in this case. 














 Another perspective with a few more graphs:
http://speakingofresearch.com/2014/01/20/public-opinion-on-animal-research-in-italy-2014/ 









 Animal research is far, far more expensive that the alternatives (bar human trials). 

Those alternatives, where they exist, are used - particularly in cosmetics (the EU has banned animal use because those alternatives exist), but those alternatives don't answer all questions. If you want to understand the impact of a single gene, there is little else you can use other than genetically altered animals (for instance) - no computer program or cell culture will answer this question. 




 Might want to do more reading on Roselli's research:
http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2007/02/wool_and_graze.html
The research aimed to understand the biological roots of homosexuality, not cure it. Particularly read to the end:

"Differences among motives matter, even when they're subtle. PETA has made hay of a 2000 paper in which Stormshak posited that gay rams "may not be exposed to the same levels" of estrogen as straight rams. "If this is true," he wrote, then estrogen therapy "might alter their sexual behavior to the point of being more like" the behavior of straight rams. PETA thinks this study threatens to advance the eradication of homosexuality.

But look more closely. The paper's title is "Influence of castration and estrogen replacement on sexual behavior of female-oriented, male-oriented, and asexual rams." And that's what the study examines: All the rams, not just the gay ones, are castrated and given estrogen. The point isn't to make the gay rams straight; it's to "restore sexual behavior" in general. And the experiment fails. Stormshak concludes:

    Because there are no readily apparent phenotypic traits that characterize the male-oriented or asexual ram, these animals are frequently selected as flock sires and hence contribute to decreased fertility of ewes and economic loss to the sheep industry. Treatment of these types of rams with estrogens to enhance their sexual behavior or performance may not be practical." 




 The researchers can get paid to do new or old research, but think about those funding it. They have a limited pot of cash which they use to give out grants. It is not financially sensible to get researchers to keep doing the same experiment (remember all of this will be published, and researchers cannot get ahead in life doing repetitive research). No one wins by repeating work, everyone wins by doing new and innovative research. Your claims simply do not fit common sense logic.

Cosmetic testing is becoming a smaller and smaller area - it's already banned across the EU, and has wound down in many countries (China as a possible exception). You don't need to test a cosmetic on an animal to get it passed regulators in the US. So most companies avoid it. 

Why on earth are you using sources which are OVER 30 YEARS OLD. The funding environment, as well as the animal welfare act has changed in that time. 

However, many incidents of people claiming repetitive research is going on comes down to others not understanding the difference between two similar-looking, but fundamentally different, bits of research
 




 Why would people fund repetition - it won't generate anyone money in the future. Animal research is hugely expensive and only used where they cannot find another method.

[shelves are 2cm (~0.8") deep]

[Floor to ceiling = 244cm (~96")

[Last shelf is 30cm (11.8") below ceiling, but will probably not have anything on (28cm for second option)]

Thoughts? 









 An interesting survey. A few thoughts. 

My big issue is the first question's first answer is such a rabble rouser - it's written in such a manner as to make your average polled-person in Palestine want to answer to "reclaim all historic palestine from the river to the sea" (words like "reclaim" seem aimed at trying to make this a high figure - and the Washington Institute has certainly been accused of bias before).

That aside:

* 70% of Gazans believe Hamas should maintain a ceasfire with Israel (28% disagreed).
* 57% of Gazans believed Hamas should renounce violence (38% disagreed)
* 64% believed levels of delay and restrictions at checkpoints were a "significant problem"

Those are your moderates. They are the majority.  




 The current situation shows the blockade **doesn't work**. It's not prevented missiles getting into Gaza. All it has done is increase the number of people prepared to fire them. 

The Israeli Iron Dome is a fantastic solution, and I hope they continue to strengthen and improve it. I have no issue with border checks, but the blockade has banned too many non-military items: http://www.economist.com/node/16264970

* cement
* iron
* wood

While these items can no doubt be put to nefarious purposes, they are necessary for a country to rebuild. 
 




 What a weird thing to say.

Dresden was a crime by the British which did little to advance the war effort. Even so, Goebbels further massaged the casualty figures to encourage the German war effort. You couldn't radicalise the Germans because all the men were already conscripted to fight the war. 

You might care to look at the impact of the US-British-led invasion of Iraq, or the US in vietnam to see how ordinary people become radicalised very quickly by conflict.  




 Just as Israel's citizens tend to vote for more hawkish parties during conflict, so did the people of Gaza - they voted for the people they *perceived* would bring them security. It's not a case of people abandoning terrorism (people become indoctrinated), it's about stopping (or reducing the number of ) new people from joining. 




 There is a short term and long term problem here - and the solutions to them are clashing badly: 

The short term problem is that Hamas has the capability and intention to strike out at Israel (though let us note that there have been thankfully few Israeli civilian casualties). This is the problem that Israel is trying to solve through a ground invasion of the Gaza.

Israel's long term problem is much the same, except that invading Gaza radicalises more moderate Palestinians, drives more support (and weaponry) from other Middle Eastern countries, and damages any hope of a proper peace settlement which is the **only** long term solution. 

Now opening up the Gaza comes with huge risks, but it does help to allow Palestinians to live normal lives - provides them with jobs, allows them to make money, and increases the opportunity cost of war for the normal Palestinian - pushing them away from groups like Hamas.  




 Hamas does have capabilities to shoot rockets. It's a terrible thing. International pressure needs to continue to push them to disarm. 
BUT
The blockade disproportionately hurts Palestinian civilians, it prevents basic provisions reaching the people who need it. It prevents people working and making a peaceful living. Ultimately it helps radicalise ordinary people to join militants within Hamas' ranks.

I also assure you that MANY people give a fuck about MH17, the Malaysian airlines plane shot down over rebel held areas of Ukraine. I also give a fuck about the current Israeli-palestine situation as I do not see either sides tactics making life safer in the long run for either side.

 My Error. My board is actually:

If I replace the board I need one with 8 internal Sata ports

 When the problem comes about it will happen every day until I switch the SSD to a new Sata port.

I need a Socket 1155 board, they hopefully should be too expensive. 




 My Mobo has 4 Sata2 ports and 4 Sata3 ports. In them is plugged:
- 2 x DVD Drives
- 4 x Storage HDD
- 1 x SSD with Operating System

Every few months I'll start having problems loading windows, which is fixed by changing the SSD from one Sata3 port to another one. Leading me to believe the Sata Ports are screwed. 

- Could this be a BIOS issue?
- Is there a fix without replacing the board
- If I replace the board, which Socket 1155 board [no onboard Gfx plz] would be a good option? (the CPU and Memory are fine for me).

 I need to buy some speakers for my living room - used for TV (films) and music. Do I go active or passive for around 250. 

I do have an amp, but my friend reckoned that active speakers were better value for money. Thoughts? 














 A few things to address. The first is that we use the many methods you mention **alongside** animal research. You use the most appropriate method for the question you want to ask. All these methods have advantages and disadvantages - so cells cultures are great for understanding a basic drug interaction, but falls short if you want to understand how a drug will move around an entire living organism. 

94% of drugs are not found safe and effective in animals, they are found safe **enough** to move to Phase I clinical trials. This happens having already passed tests in cell cultures and computer models.
Around 88% of the drugs found safe **enough** in Phase I clinical trials, still fail in later human trials - so it is not a case of the failure of our models, just the difficulties of drug development. 

I recommend reading this:

 There has been some pretty impressive non-animal techniques aimed at helping countries like China remove their need for cosmetic testing
http://www.ibtimes.com/first-human-skin-sample-grown-lab-could-artificial-epidermis-end-animal-testing-1576882  



















 1. Theft, by any normal definition, is depriving someone else of their property without their consent - it has nothing to do with the threat of violence (which would be closer to "mugging").
2. Your taxation=theft argument relies on a newly created, non-standard definition of theft
3. I think many people don't object to paying their tax (I don't - I get great services for it). I don't pay more than I owe - I pay what I owe - for the services rendered.
4. People don't pay more than they owe in tax because they don't get any additional benefit from doing so. It would simply lead to free-riding by others. 




 Some of the terminology below is specific to the UK

Many large firms avoid paying tax by clever methods such as inter-firm lending and settling headquarters in tax havens. So my idea was:
Firms with a turnover of 20 million or less are unaffected, continuing to pay corporation tax on profits
Firms with a turnover of over 20 million pay whichever is greater out of X% of profits (based on corporation tax) or 1% of turnover (could be less than 1% if necessary). 

This means there is no way of avoiding tax altogether. Providing your turnover was based on sales in the UK (or whichever country we are discussing) you would be liable to tax. You could not fake low profits through inter-firm lending, or such like, to avoid tax.

Thoughts?

 This is ridiculous. Sabin, a very famous researcher, was hugely in support of animal research and PETA are trying to make it sound like he wasn't. Read Sabin's own words:
"In a recent letter to the Journal (Misrepresenting Research, Feb. 20), Dr. Stephen R. Kaufman, the chairman of the Medical Research Modernization Committee, correctly quoted my 1984 testimony before Congress but he drew wrong conclusions from it.  Dr. Kaufman was also wrong when the said the polio vaccine was based on a tissue culture preparation  not animal experimentation.

On the contrary, my own experience of more than 60 years in biomedical research amply demonstrated that without the use of animals and of human beings, it would have been impossible to acquire the important knowledge needed to prevent much suffering and premature death not only among humans but also among animals."

 The scientist believes animal research is important, and writes something which criticises some particular aspect or shortcoming of testing

The reddit article picks up on those misrepresentations.

Not quite sure how this supports PETA's side of things.

 A good view on both sides. The only thing I take issue with is the 70 million - I'm not sure where that figure comes from but looks to be higher than the reality. 




 Interesting article, but flawed:

1. USDA covered animals account for under 1 million animals per year. If you add mice and rats you are unlikely to reach more than 20 million:
http://speakingofresearch.com/facts/statistics/

2. The reality is that this statistic has been taken out of context. A good explanation is written by Prof Robin Lovell-Badge here, explaining it:
http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/01/23/nine-out-of-ten-statistics-are-taken-out-of-context/

3. Is correct - and something I personally disagree with, but do not think that being AWA exempt, exempts them from all regulations:
http://speakingofresearch.com/facts/research-regulation/

4. This is true, and something I think needs to change BUT it contradicts Fact 1. 1 million animals ARE counted, so if 90% are not, then the total would be 10 million not 100 million (in truth around 95% are probably not counted).

5. I agree that cosmetic testing should be banned worldwide. 

6. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee exists, in part, to ensure animal research does not go ahead where there are viable alternatives. In the EU this is written into the laws governing animal research.

7. Possibly true, but such environmental research is often done on fish larvae, where thousands may be killed at once, although they are not properly formed and are unlikely able to feel pain at this point.

8. Draize tests (eye irritation) are rarely performed, and are done WITH pain relief. At least in the US and EU.

9. If you don't test pregnant animals you end up with disasters like Thalidomide.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide

10. Cosmetic testing does need to end. Many countries are phasing out household products as well.

11. Yup - though they don't exist for most research
 




 Be careful not to anthropomorphise animals - they are not human. An animal is not in a testing lab thinking of all the other places it can be. And outside a lab is no utopia. 
Inside a lab they have warmth, food, shelter, veterinary care etc. However, they also will suffer (if only from being confined). Nonetheless, they do not have to worry about predation, starvation, thirst, freezing to death etc.

 The Islamic State has been gaining thousands of followers just through its own successes - doing nothing is not much of an alternative. 

I agree that bombing Iraq, and civilian casualties that result, will create some extremists, but I think doing nothing could be worse. If the Iraqi government can regain control of the country it is the best chance to reduce the number of extremists. 




 Interesting perspective, but makes sense.  




 No ground troops - only air strikes in Iraq 




 Very unlikely, though no doubt a handful do. 

The parties have been urging MPs to vote with them and support intervention in Iraq. 




 We hope that through airstrikes we can support the Iraqi ground forces enough that they can regain the territory lost to the Islamic State in the past few months. 
Given that the Islamic State is encouraging terrorists in countries around the world, we feel the world would be better without a strong Islamic State (IS) movement.

You are right we could do it in human (not always faster - we simply couldn't not study the role of genetics in slow growing humans as effectively as some of the work that is done in genetically modified mice), but most would consider this unethical. 




 It's also the only we will develop new medicines which save millions of lives. The moment you start equating human and other animal lives you start to create all sorts of moral issues - do you have a moral obligation to prevent a lion killing an antelope (you would stop a lion killing a human).  









 Well in the situations of hyperinflation the government tends to print money and use it to pay its debt. 

In quantitative easing the government buys debt or government bonds from banks. 




 Money is just a medium of wealth used to assist bartering. If one person has all the money it ceases to play that role. Alternative currencies would set up (e.g. gold standard, where there is some intrinsic value). 




 Inflation is defined two ways (both mean the same thing):
- The rise in the general price of goods
- The fall in the value of money

If you print money, there is more money in the economy yet the same amount of goods. So the nominal prices of those limited goods rises.  




 When you print a large amount of money the value of currency decreases (inflation), and people's wealth decreases...

 Both work individually, but if both are plugged in, one will not function properly. Surely that can't be a formatting issue? 




 I have two unpowered 2TB HDDs. I plug them into a powered USB hub, so that boxee need not power them. One has Films, one has TV shows.

Boxee can read both drives fine if only one is plugged in. 
Boxee cannot read both, if they are both plugged in - it just reads one and assumes the second drive has identical information. If I try and play a file from the "unrecognised" drive, then it merely says it cannot access the file or directory.

 A rather cynical view. By the same is the motivation of a Doctor seeing a patient to get paid and hopefully get a promotion? No, it's to try and help people. 

Yes, there are profits involved, just as there is in healthcare, education and most other positive endeavours, but that doesn't make it the primary motivation of the people involved. Most researchers I know working on diseases in animals, really want to find a treatment - not for the profit, but for the patient. 

Very little animal research is done by the military, but the bit that is is almost all for treating war injuries e.g. the best treatment on site for someone who has been shot to ensure they survive, or studies into PTSD.

 Except they haven't. Students might be paying a bit longer (hello graduate tax) but they aren't paying any more.

The fact they said they'd do one thing, and did another, is a fair frustration - they should have abstained - they're paying the price for that.

 Ex-research dogs really shouldn't be aggressive, or something is going wrong with their socialisation programmes. 
Usually ex-research dogs are not adopted because:
- concerns of any medical side effects that are yet to show
- the dogs are used to a lot of routine, and they are used to a lot of human contact time (vets, technicians and researchers are around a lot of the time), as well as tending to be group housed - so a family looking for one dog, who will leave alone it for hours on end (when at work) would result in a more stressed dog

 Washing up 









 When 9/11 happened, some people chose to burn to death, but around 200 people chose to jump - knowing they would die. 

People who choose euthanasia make a similar choice - a quick death vs a long slow painful death from disease.

I understand why people chose to jump in 9/11, I understand why people choose to die with dignity in a hospital - I think euthanasia should be legalised.

 Read the article - we're not there yet.

Dr Rob Buckle, head of regenerative medicine at the MRC, said: 

"This research is an exciting *early* step towards that goal, and a convincing demonstration of the potential power of direct reprogramming technology, by which once cell type is converted to another. However, much more work will be needed before this process can be reproduced in the lab environment, and in a safe and tightly controlled way suitable for use in humans." 




 Yes, we have the first stage of growing organs - there will be a lot of animal research before that gets anywhere near a person. They still need to get over transplant rejection, getting organs to proper size (among other issues). Your suggestion that we were already at a stage where this was a usable technology was nonsense. 




 What planet are you on?!

"We can now grow new organs with stem cells"
No, no we can't!! 




 Why doesn't the future require liver or kidney damage studies? Are people who suffer organ failure worth less in your opinion? 




 It depend which minorities. If you look at those who arrived recently - such as Romanians, Bulgarians etc, then yes, they are doing worse - there is a lot of prejudice in our system.

 Well the LD50 is rarely used - it's not a particularly useful test - I mean any dosage that kills half a group of mice is clearly too high (when weight adjusted) for humans. 

There is a lot more to animal research than toxicology - most of it is about understanding the processes going on. So, for the macular degenration I expect there were a lot of studies working out which stem cells were key to the formation of the eye, and what effect they have when implanted into an adult eye etc. 




 Stem cell treatments are developed using animal studies. So the recent stem cell treatment for age related macular degeneration was only possible because of knowledge derived from mouse and primate tests.

 I graduated from Oxford Uni seven years ago. A few thoughts.

First off. There are great minds everywhere, from the top uni to the bottom, and many great minds that never went at all. That said, you are likely to find that Harvard/Oxford(etc) have a high proportion of very clever people than at lower ranked universities. 

You will find great tutors at all universities. I will go one step further and say that Harvard/Oxford does not necessarily have the best tutors/lecturers. Whereas as a small American liberal arts college may hire a professor for their teaching abilities, top universities tend to hire great academics (those who excel in their field), and top academics do not necessarily make great tutors and lecturers. In my time at Oxford I had great and terrible lecturers. Of my two best tutors, one was a DPhil student (the other was Prof Mayhew). 

Comparing my experience with friends, the major differences between my university and some "lower ranked" universities was:

- Workload: I was expected to read up for, and write, two x 2000 word essays per week. The reading list would be 8-20 books/papers for each. In fact, learning to read quickly and effectively is the single biggest skill I took away from Oxford. One consequence is people cover a lot of ground very fast. One third of my first year was economics, yet I covered more economic theory in my first year than some friends at other universities did in their first year.

- Connections: I met a lot of very driven people, many of whom are on the path to becoming very successful. The contacts I made at Oxford will last a lifetime. The "Oxford" name obviously helps - many employers, rightly or wrongly, would prefer to hire an Oxbridge graduate over (probably equally able) other people.

- Great minds: The tutorial system at Oxford - whereby two people are grilled by each other and a professor each week for an hour - sharpens your mind. It makes you able to vocalise your thoughts concisely and confidently. You are constantly challenged by people who are as smart or smarter.

 Russia and America are very different places. 

Russia is much more autocratic (see democracy index), has lower standards of living (about half the GDP/Person (PPP), is more corrupt (US ranked 19th best, Russia ranked 127th).

Much less media freedom, more repressive laws (consider that in Russia promoting a gay agenda is a crime) .... there are many differences.

 Great to see the background studies that made this possible 









 It's not a better or worse training programme, it's a different approach. What it does do, is get people who may not have considered teaching, into the profession, a proportion of whom stay on for years. 

Remember that "traditional" routes into teaching have similar high drop out rates over the first 3 years of teaching. 




 Most first year teachers don't know how to manage behaviour - TFA or otherwise. My experience in the UK suggests to me that after the first year (where PGCE students have done some teaching and learning, and Teach First (UK version of TFA) have done a year teaching on their own) the Teach First'ers were a lot better equipped to deal with behaviour. 




 While some of the UK academies have failed, they have generally outperformed non-academies, and certainly turned round many under performing schools. There are issues with academies, but I wouldn't call the whole programme a failure.

 And then Steam isn't recognising all the files in the new folder and is downloading them all over again 




 Can't add a folder which is not empty 




 All my games ARE on a separate hard drive. But they all get installed initially to the SSD and then moved off to a second drive using steamtool. 

FFXIII was different because the installation appears to require about 80GB (even though the game is only 60GB), which is more than I have spare on the SSD.  




 I have FFXIII on the G:\ with a SteamTool link pointing at it from my C:\ steamapps\common game directory (as with all my games).

Normally If I then "installed" a game that was there it would find the game and not feel the need to reinstall, but instead it's trying to redownload the entire 50GB game. 

I know the game is working as I can play it by using the launcher in its current location, but Steam library thinks it is uninstalled. 




 I have enough disk space to download FFXIII (with about 10GB to spare - it's a small SSD).

When I finish, I plan to use SteamTool to move it to another drive where all my other games are:

BUT

Steam is creating a 20GB "downloading" folder in addition to the 43GB it's downloaded so far (of 49.4GB of the game). Which is taking me over my available space.

Start collating all the previous emails you have had over the year about how you are doing. Any emails where you've asked for observation or advice on improving. Essentially you need to have ready a case on why the school has failed you rather than you have failed the school.

As many people have said, do not talk to anyone face to face without a union rep, and ensure you take notes at any meetings (or ensure your rep does - don't rely on the administration to do so effectively). At the end of any face-to-face meeting write up what you felt was said and agreed at the meeting and email it to both the administration and union rep to sign off - so there can be no confusion later.

A moral imperative to reduce suffering in animals does not mean that animals must have rights. Just as a moral imperative to keep your city clean, or not to tread on the garden flowers doesn't suggest rights for the city or flowers. 

Rights are more than a duty of protection - they require reciprocal duties on both parties. My right not to be robbed is linked to my duty not to steal

 I don't think the article justifies unnecessary suffering to other animals - while it argues different species have different capacities for suffering, it certainly thinks (at minimum) all mammals can suffer.

 Interesting. I've asked Dr Marvizon about the seeming contradiction. Will report back if I hear anything. 




 This is meant to be a scientific forum. Dr Mavizon is discussing the capacity for different types of suffering. He needs to define it because IT'S SCIENCE. You don't argue "it doesn't matter which way the blood flows, as long as we all agree its moving". He is explaining the different ways in which humans and animals can suffer and the different capacities different species have for it.

 Arguably there is stronger separation in the US. You have an executive and legislative branch, whereas our executive is made up of the legislature - so essentially a powerful Prime Minister has ability to change anything (the UK system is sometimes described as a elected dictatorship).  




 What?!

Liberal Democrats = 2.4 million votes = 8 seats

Greens = 1.2 million votes = 1 seat

Liberal = 4,000 votes = 0 seats
 




 She has Corgis to do that for her 




 The Conservatives have a majority. 

In 2010, the UK had its first and only post-war coalition, when the Liberal Democrats (57 seats) went into coalition with the Conservatives (306 seats). Labour and Conservatives together still accounted for 564 of the total seats.  









 Firstly, since 1945 there are only two parties with any chance of winning - Labour and Conservatives (for many years prior to 1945 it was similar, except the Liberal party instead of Labour). So in that way, it would be a two-party system.

Because of First-past-the-post (FPTP) and the Spoiler Effect (a bit) the two main parties stitched up over 550 of the 650 seats in every election since1945. 

2005 marked the early rise of the Liberal Democrats, gaining around 60 seats in both 2005 and 2010. They avoided the spoiler effect by chasing local issue votes, anti-war votes, and Liberal votes (e.g. against internet snooping, holding suspects without trial etc). 

What, I believe, 2010 did, was galvanise 3rd parties - they all thought they could do what the Lib Dems did. 

In Scotland, the Spoiler Effect essentially destroyed the Lib Dem. Conservative, Labour vote - who were all seen as very similar compared with the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) resulting in an almost complete wipeout for the traditional parties in Scotland. 

Plaid Cymru fight issue politics for seats in Wales. Northern Ireland has always had its own parties. We still have a two party-dominated system - perhaps more so now that the SNP (who have a maximum possibility of the 59 Scottish seats) are the third party, and perhaps even more now that the Liberal Democrat vote has collapsed (from 56 to 8 seats) and spread the protest vote 3 ways (I hope the Liberal-side of their vote returns, but it won't be fast).

 So my friend, Antonio, was found short of money after his big trading deal seemed to go south. Problem was he and I had made a deal with a loan-shark called Shylock who was demanding a pound of his flesh as the insurance cost for a loan. 

I was there at the trial, we had the money, but the loan-shark demanded his pound of flesh. Anyway, the day was saved by a lawyer's assistant called Balthazar, except that I didn't realise that it was in fact my wife in disguise! She managed to save Antonio but at the end, while in disguise, she demanded my wedding ring as a tribute for her service in saving my friend.

Anyway, it was a bit of a trick as when I arrived home she castigated me for giving away my wedding ring. I tried to explain but she was furious. Eventually she admitted the truth, that she was Balthazar.

 We definitely do have strict guidelines - in fact it was the guidelines which protect animal welfare (EU Directive 2010/63) that the ECI petition wanted to remove 




 Good decisions come from experience; experience comes from bad decisions

 I always liked Orac's stuff on vaccines. Well thought out.  




 Science communication - working with the public and media explaining why animals are used in medical research 




 Would you beat yourself up if you quit after a year? Do you enjoy the principle of what you're doing. 

I quit after 3 years and never regretted it.

 This party takes place on inflatable boats, so something which won't immediately become unwearable if I get wet would be helpful.  



















 Stand up and publicly explain why animal research is important. 

In 2006, when I was a student at Oxford, UK, extremists were putting bombs in college buildings and declaring students "legitimate targets". A small group of us organised a counter-rally to a national animal rights demonstration despite many people saying it was madness. 

In the end almost 1,000 students and scientists marched through the streets in support of biomedical research while only around 400 animal rights activists turned up for their demo (at the same time). More info on it: http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/25/animalwelfare.highereducation

I have helped organise similar demonstrations in Milan, Italy and Los Angeles, USA.  














 I thought this would be a story about a man who owned a spoon company 









 I only wish my students were as eloquent when I was teaching 




 Looking at the Directive: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010L0063 from=EN

The following is NOT a licensed procedure (therefore not in the stats): 
"practices not likely to cause pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm equivalent to, or higher than, that caused by the introduction of a needle in accordance with good veterinary practice"
or
"practices undertaken for the purposes of recognised animal husbandry"

So measuring and weighing wouldn't. Chipping might. 




 I *think* Celphalapods are included (octopuses and cuttlefish; though I'mn not sure any are actually used), but you are right that nearly all invertebrates are not included. I do not know of a country where they count them (the main ones being fruit flies and nematode worms)  





























 Thanks

 Every drug which is approved for market is done so on the basis of HUMAN clinical trials. Animal trials ensure that very dangerous drugs don't get to Stage I clinical trials. Something they have a great track record for. 

Then there is the development of the drugs, which relies on understanding of both disease and physiology, gained in large parts from animal studies.  




 This claim is very misleading, since scientists were mislead not by the fact that they were using animals, monkeys develop polio infection the same way humans do, but by their own belief that polio was spread through the nasal passages, whereas the main route of infection is through the gut.  Scientists working on polio in monkeys up to the late 1940s had found out a lot about the polio virus but theyre were seriously hampered by the fact that it was thought that polio could not be grown outside a living organism due to the failure of repeated attempts to grow it in cell culture. This failure also made it extremely difficult to obtain the quantities of virus necessary for vaccine research. John Enders breakthrough discovery that polio could be grown in tissue culture enabled scientists to grow large amounts of many different strains of polio in tissue culture which could then be assessed for their potential as vaccines. What anti-vivisectionists dont point out is that Enders relied on testing in monkeys to verify that the virus was indeed growing and to examine the pathogenicity of different strains (1,2). Enders studies also indicated that polio could grow in a variety of tissues, not just nerve tissue as had previously been assumed, and this led Albert Sabine to study in monkeys whether infection could occur via the gut.

Jonas Salk quickly used Enders technique to develop the killed polio virus vaccine Salk vaccine, which he tested successfully in monkeys before deciding to take it to human trials (3).

In the end research with monkeys was vital to gaining a correct understanding of the biology of the polio virus. Using monkeys David Bodian demonstrated that the polio virus entered the body through the digestive system, and not through the lungs as had previously been thought, a finding that was key to the development of an oral vaccine. Albert Sabin tested many different strains of attenuated polio virus in hundreds of monkeys and scores of chimps before identifying attenuated strains that were capable of efficiently entering the body through the digestive system and provoking an adequate immune response to protect against the different pathogenic strains of polio while not causing the disease themselves. These were the strains that subsequently proved successfully in human trials. Sabin could not have made this advance without the use of monkeys and in a scientific paper  discussing his research (4) wrote:

"approximately 9,000 monkeys, 150 chimpanzees and 133 human volunteers have been used thus far in the quantitative studies of various characteristics of different strains of polio virus. [These studies] were necessary to solve many problems before an oral polio vaccine could become a reality."

The true story is that before the discovery of John Enders, scientists using monkeys to study polio were making slow progress, after his discovery scientists using monkeys (and a few chimps) were able to make very rapid progress.

From the initial 1908 discovery through research on monkeys by Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper that polio was caused by a virus (5) to the development of the oral polio vaccine it is clear that animal research played a vital role in every major advance.

 I agree with you. My original question wasn't an imperial vs metric question, it was whether another base would be any more difficult. 




 Good point. Makes a good case for a hexadecimal system 




 What's your point? Mixing calculations is always hard, but if you had 12 inches to a foot and 12 feet to a "sandal" - it'd be easier in base 12.

It would be:

- 10 [12] inches = 1 [12] feet
- 10 [12] feet = 1 [12] "sandal"
- so: 100 [12] inches  = 1 [12] "sandal"
