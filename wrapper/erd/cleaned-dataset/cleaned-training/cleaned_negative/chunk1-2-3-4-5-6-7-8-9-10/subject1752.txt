 Small victory, but these insights also make it much more interesting in my opinion to watch other highly intelligent animals like whales and elephants. Here's a cool article[1] expanding on the point about matters of degree into areas where other animals might actually have cognitive capacities beyond ours.


Let's just say, our globe's legal systems have a hard enough time admitting all people have universal rights. It's going to take a lot more to change this pervasive mindset of human dominion over all species. Hell, we slaughter and imprison billions of animals for food every year; if we, as a society, can't even bring ourselves to stop eating them in every meal, what chance is there for anything even resembling rights?

 Northern Quebec is mostly populated from Haitian descent immigrants according to this map. But then again it's only 30 people who account for 7.5% of the population....So that makes sense.
I am quite surprised at how many Filipino people there are. I would have said Chinese or Vietnamese would be higher.

 china doesnt need carriers, they just need to sink the US carriers.. apparently some subs can get right under them easily 




 http://www.quora.com/How-vulnerable-are-the-US-aircraft-carriers-and-battle-groups-to-enemy-attack 




 
Their are numerous links, pics and articles demonstrating a submarines ability to get in position, sink below a thermal layer and in complete silence launch a salvo of devastating weapons. The response from the carrier group would be immediate, total and savage but the sub is still invisible and depending on its next steps, stands a very real chance of surviving. Diesel Electrics and Subs using Air Propulsion drive shafts have long been discussed and studied to learn tactics to defend against. The Swedish navy 'rented' an entire Sub and crew to the U.S. Navy to work against, the six month tour ended up extending to two years such was the realisation that these subs were very dangerous to carriers and large capital ships

A carrier battlegroup is difficult but not impossible to attack. There is some vulnerability to submarines as well as cruise missiles that fly very low. The important thing to take into account, however, is that these weapons have fairly short ranges and are sophisticated enough that few adversaries posses them. The only "mid-ocean" risk would be from Russia (or a former Soviet country) that has a nuclear attack submarine. Non-nuclear submarines and cruise missiles will both operate within several  hundred miles of an enemy coast. The weapons of a carrier battlegroup are of sufficient range that they can stay outside of the range of these weapons and still attack the enemy.

Several countries have developed very quiet non-nuclear submarines. In a conflict, however, the ASW forces associated with a carrier battle group will be actively looking for these subs. The sub hunters are using combinations of active and passive sonar buoys, helicopters with dipped arrays, as well as other tools. While not every target can be defended like this, it is likely that a carrier battle group will be well defended.

Another commenter pointed out the risk of anti-ship missiles like the DF-21. There are several problems with those systems, not the least of which is that they would need to be targeted accurately against a moving target from a long distance away. Second, the ballistic variants look an awful lot like nuclear missiles, and so could lead to an inadvertent nuclear escalation.


**Aircraft carriers are a remnant of WWII and would not last long in a full-fledged conflict where modern technology is used**, but that is not their purpose today.

the US fight against the Filipino "insurrectionists" at the turn of the century remains a blank spot to most Americans. There are some very good reasons for this. Most people don't like to be reminded that the US was an openly racist major power more interested in trade than in freeing the natives of the Philippines. It is disturbing to read about American heros like Teddy Roosevelt denigrating the "niggers" who inhabited the island, and soft-pedalling widespread torture by the US military (most notably the rather nasty 'water cure'). It is also interesting to read how many people did not value the islands that much themselves, but felt that they were needed to be our springboard to the China trade -- which was going to make everyone rich, of course! It took the Japanese empire at its worst to make the US look like a friend to many Filipinos, and this book tells why.

 An excellent telling of a period that most Americans and Filipinos know little or nothing about. With America's new ownership of the Philippines, we were drawn into a second conflict once the Spanish were routed. The insurrectionist movement against America brought about a bloody and savage war that cost tens of thousands of lives. The third phase was the attempt to subdue the Moros, some of the toughest and most fearless warriors on the planet. The troops involved thought they would only be fighting Spanish regulars and then sent home. Rather, many spent years fighting in jungles and swamps against a clever and determined foe, and many were then shipped off to fight the Boxer's in China in 1900, only to be returned to battle the often fiendish inhabitants of places like Sibago Island, Jolo and Samar. A classic account and ranks with "Muddy Glory" and "Little Brown Brother" to name but a couple. There isn't much written about this conflict, but the information is out there. These lessons should have taught America about getting involved in smaller nations affairs.

  This is also a study in racism; how allegedly "superior" Anglo-Saxons needed to "civilize" and "Christianize" the Filipinos, many of whom were Catholic. Overall, this book is a good primer about a shocking and somewhat vile episode in American history. High School history teachers in particular should read this book and include it in their lessons about the outcome of our "splendid little war" with Spain. It is a sad truth that as a result of this conflict, America did not seem to learn anything about the nature of guerilla warfare with a people fighting to be free of foreign control. Our failure to profit from this episode helped propel us into another such quagmire in Vietnam, a nation not too far from the site of our earlier fiasco in the Philippines.

  They slowly began to realize that their major foe was not really the formally constituted, but in many ways ineffectual, Philippine Army; rather, it was the Filipino people, who, having finally gotten rid of the Spanish, were unrelentingly and implacably hostile to American imperialist designs. The implications of this understanding were fully realized only later and in the bloodiest manner imaginable. But as early as April 1899, General Shafter gave grisly portent to the future conduct of the war: "It may be necessary to kill half the Filipinos in order that the remaining half of the population may be advanced to a higher plane of life than their present semi-barbarous state affords."7

The American command had presumably been taken in by its own press releases. Gen. Arthur MacArthur 8, Otis's subordinate (and later replacement), commented, "... I believed that Aguinaldo's troops represented only a faction. I did not like to believe that the whole population of Luzon-the native population, that is-was opposed to us..."9 But this he was "reluctantly compelled" to believe because the "unique system of warfare" employed by the Filipino Army" ... depended upon almost complete unity of action of the entire native population." 10

The Fil-Am war started when the Americans had promised, in writing, to free Filipinos from the Spanish to form a new Philippine nation under Filipino rule, and then reneged on the promise.
The phrase "our little brown bothers" comes from this era as the excuse to break the agreement. The attitudes are summed up in political cartoons of the time: 1[1]  , 2[2]   and 3[3]  . This really no different from attitudes prevalent today about arabs and muslims. We simply call the all "terrorists" as a direct substitute for "nxxxxx" as used in 1899. Nothing has changed.


Today the US does the equivalent when it drone attacks wedding parties and funerals or puts innocents in concentration camps like Abu Ghraib or Camp X Ray to be killed and to attempt indoctrination which often failed. In the latter case, stronger guerrilla nationalists were created as a result (i.e. ISIS which is largely led by former Saddam-era Baathist-ex-military-officers).


Even today, there is still a smoldering nationalist, anti-American thread in Philippine society; it's what got the US bases (over 2,000 under Marcos) kicked out by Cory Aquino. That the US had to have 2,000 bases simply to maintain control tells you a lot. The same will occur in Iraq and Afghanistan.


The US also managed to coopt various guerrilla movements with only marginal success in the Philippines. The communist NPA guerrilla was CIA-owned by the 1980s and actively used against the Philippine government and society broadly to "achieve US policy" but the Muslim MILF/Huks never were. 




 In fact, the US-Philippine War (the Spanish-Amercan War was over in 2 weeks - akin to the Blitzkrieg of the Iraq invasion), is the closest similar war in US history to the Iraq war. Exactly like Iraq, the Philippines went 3rd-order guerrilla instantly and bogged down US forces causing more blowback than any good achieved.
Similarly the US resorted to what are now called "War Crimes, "Crimes Against Humanity" and "Genocide" in putting Filipino women and children into the Boer War invented "concentration camps" when the men from a village had gone to the Bundok ("mountain(s)" in Tagalog - source of our word "boondocks") to fight the guerrilla war against the Americas. This was done again in Vietnam as "protective hamlets" which were always involuntary and unviable for the detainees inside them. In Iraq, it was "every able-bodied man" who was put into a concentration camp or targeted by a drone.

 its stupid to assume irans state media is lies while our media is truth 




 too bad most peoples bubble contains american sniper, zero dark thirty, nfa football saluting soldiers to the USA USA drumbeat 




 i wonder if he ever thinks about it heh 




 they knew it wasnt gonna pass 




 I'd vote Democrat too if they ended the Mexican apartheid  




 Ya especially if you post them a bunch  




 I definitely agree he sometimes went after too low hanging fruit! And also implying questioning the government makes you crazy makes me crazy  




 So do 9/11 hijackers  




 Jolie is trolling her  




 Imgur clicks are different than YouTube clicks  




 And /r/politics already got hijacked by establishment dems 

(also why won't Sanders talk about immigration?) 




 That's really curious, maybe because one of your links? The US supported Muslim rebels across the globe, and they're supporting them in Syria and Libya. Syria used to be a counterpart to Israel, now it's been destroyed.  




 Ya he's such a dick about the whole thing   




 In One of the videos he is right handed!  




 Ya this seems like a reasonable argument  




 got to be honest, the guy knows his stuff.. i mean, he knows a ton of the common points that ive seen and has pretty reasonable answers as well

i found this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiYplRaHBDQ 




 how did u know~ 




 the biggest english language internet forum videos section doesnt allow you to question police authority. 




 nottheonion is part of the cancer, they banned me for nothing as well 




 the most unconvincing video i ever saw was NISTs simulation of what happened in the towers

it falls apart completely different than it did in reality 




 hey at least thats a different flavor than the american style we get here 99% of the time 




 dont tell me we are defending the vietnam war now too.., 




 https://www.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/39ezan/what_are_the_officialmainstream_explanations_for/ 




 im wondering what peoples explanations are for the 3 collapsed buildings! and why they fell in on themselves in such a clean fashion.. 




 hey that sounds kind of reasonable, fuck if i know 




 yea i thought it was a good discussion and havent seen any official explanations 




 What are the official/mainstream explanations for the persisting heat at ground zero, and the inability to put out the fires for so long? Truthers, why is that explanation wrong?

According to the government's own website[1] , the hottest spots on the surface of Ground Zero were over 700 C (1292 F), and even after 5 days of efforts by the firefighters, the hot spots were still above the melting point of aluminum (1221 F / 660.3 C). Some conspiracy theory sources reason that this was because thermite makes it's own oxygen and can be used under water. 




 so where did the thermite residue come from and what caused the fires so hot and long lasting they melted steel?

 nah i just stole the comments from elsewhere 




 yea i acutally support them personally 




 Lets assume you are right, someone just lied about thermite in that peer reviewed study, this still does not detract from the point that all the evidence suggests that some form on thermitic material was used and thus the official government conspiracy theory is a complete made up fantasy story

____

NIST claims that WTC 1 amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called irrelevant, given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.

**Physical Evidence**

-----

* [Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMAs 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study](http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf)
* [Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled The Deep Mystery of Melted Steel, which said:](http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html)

 gt; Steel  which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit  may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon  called a eutectic reaction  occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.

* [Stating that the New York Times called these findings perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation, the article added:](http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html)

 gt;A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges  which are curled like a paper scroll  have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes  some larger than a silver dollar  let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending  but not holes.

* [In May 2004, the RJ Lee Group issued a report, entitled WTC Dust Signature, at the request of the Deutsche Bank, in order to prove \(to its insurance company\) that the building was pervasively contaminated with WTC Dust](http://web.archive.org/web/20131204202627/http://www.ae911truth.org/documents/WTCDustSignature_ExpertReport.051304.1646.mp_.pdf) The report listed five elements in this signature, one of which was: Spherical iron and spherical or vesicular silicate particles that result from exposure to high temperature

* [In 2005, the United States Geological Survey \(USGS\) published a report entitled Particle Atlas of World Trade Center Dust, which was intended to aid the identification of WTC dust components. Among the components, it reported, were metal or metal oxides (which could not be distinguished by the USGSs methods). The primary metal and metal-oxide phases in WTC dust, the report said, are Fe-rich \[iron-rich\] and Zn-rich [zinc-rich] particles](http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1165/508OF05-1165.html)
* [Extremely high temperatures during the World Trade Center destruction](http://journalof911studies.com/articles/WTCHighTemp2.pdf) 
* [Journal of the American Society of Safety Engineers](http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/wtc/analysis/asse_groundzero1.htm)
 gt;The debris pile at Ground Zero was always tremendously hot. Thermal measurements taken by helicopter each day showed underground temperatures ranging from 400F to more than 2,800F
* [Sources related to exceptionally high temperatures, and/or to persistent heat at Ground Zero](http://911research.wtc7.net/papers/dreger/GroundZeroHeat2008_07_10.pdf) 
* FEMA documents in their [Appendix C of its May 2002 WTC Building Performance Assessment Team study](http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1512-20490-8452/403_apc.pdf), for sample 1, evidence of a severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel, including oxidation and sulfidation with subsequent intergranular melting. A sulfur-rich liquid containing primarily iron, oxygen, and sulfur penetrated into the steel.

* [New York Fire Department Captain Philip Ruvolo said: Youd get down below and youd see molten steel, molten steel, running down the channel rails, like youre in a foundry, like lava.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQyIN6OTMyY)
* [Joe OToole, a Bronx firefighter who worked on the rescue and cleanup efforts, reported that one beam lifted from deep below the surface months later, in February 2002, was dripping from the molten steel.](http://fallenbrothers.com/community/showthread.php?2062-Recovery-worker-reflects-on-months-spent-at-Ground-Zero amp;p=2948)

**Testimony from Other Professionals:**

-----

* [Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the World Trade Center, said 21 days after the attack: When we were down at the B1 level, one of the firefighters said, I think youd be interested in this, and they pulled up a big block of concrete and there was a, like a little river of steel, flowing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmHqES_lto amp;t=40s)
* [Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health who arrived at Ground Zero September 12, 2001, said: Feeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helens and the thousands who fled that disaster.](http://web.archive.org/web/20060909104247/http://www.seau.org/SEAUNews-2001-10.pdf)
* [In late fall 2001, Dr. Alison Geyh of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported: Fires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.](http://www.jhsph.edu/Publications/Special/Welch.htm)
* [Joe Allbaugh, the Director of FEMA, said in an October 2001 interview on CBS: Its just too hot for rescuers to get into \[some\] areas. So we do not know yet whats in those areas, other than very hot, molten material.](http://web.archive.org/web/20130730103131/http://911encyclopedia.com/wiki/index.php/Publication:20121014014812)
* Dr. Keith Eaton reported in Structural Engineer: They showed us many fascinating slides . . . ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event, to 4-inch thick steel plates sheared and bent in the disaster.
* [Don Carson, a hazardous materials expert from the National Operating Engineers Union, said six weeks after 9/11: There are pieces of steel being pulled out from as far as six stories underground that are still cherry red.](http://web.archive.org/web/20060818074723/http:/pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nydailynews/87451160.html?did=87451160 amp;FMT=ABS amp;FMTS=FT amp;date=Nov+1,+2001 amp;author=GREG+GITTRICH+DAILY+NEWS+STAFF+WRITER amp;pub=New+York+Daily+News amp;desc=FIRE+MAY+SMOLDER+FOR+MONTHS)
* [OSHA respond to the underground fires and potential steam explosions](http://imgur.com/CCqRzAo)   

 gt; Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. As the
huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the
effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the
hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause
a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special
expertise was needed. **OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural
engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a
special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments.**

**Testimony from Other Credible Witnesses:**

-----

* [Greg Fuchek, vice president of a company that supplied computer equipment used to identify human remains, reported that sometimes when a worker would pull a steel beam from the wreckage, the end of the beam would be dripping molten steel.](http://gcn.com/articles/2002/09/09/handheld-app-eased-recovery-tasks.aspx)
* [Sarah Atlas, of New Jerseys Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue, arrived at Ground Zero on September 11 and reported that fires burned and molten steel flowed in the pile of ruins still settling beneath her feet.](http://www.sas.upenn.edu/sasalum/newsltr/summer2002/k911.html)
* Tom Arterburn, writing in Waste Age, reported that the New York Department of Sanitation removed everything from molten steel beams to human remains

--------

The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact.

When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of professionals, the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and resulting fires is simply not credible 




  gt; What are the official/mainstream explanations for the persisting heat at ground zero

There isn't one.

 gt;Some conspiracy theory sources reason that this was because thermite makes it's own oxygen and can be used under water

It is not a theory that thermite might have been involved, there is peer reviewed documentation that nano-thermite most defiantly was involved

 Just don't smoke. Do something else instead. Do something good for yourself when you feel the urge to smoke. This is a technique that can be applied to many challenging areas of life. When you have a bad feeling creeping in, use it as a direct stimulation to do something good in place of it. It starts a new kind of habit and a new kind of addiction: getting addicted to becoming the kind of person you really want to be. Don't give up. 




 This went on for many months, and eventually led to me just buying regular cigarettes again, rolling tobacco, and becoming a heavier smoker than I ever had been before. When I decided to quit again after seven years of steady smoking, it was extremely challenging, probably one of the hardest things I had faced up till then. I did it cold-turkey and didn't use any method other than distraction. I don't think willpower would've worked for me. I had to distract myself with life.

 There is a large body of evidence indicating that cross-country differences in income levels are
associated with differences in productivity. If workers are much more productive in one country
than in another, restrictions on immigration lead to large efficiency losses. The paper quantifies
these losses, using a model in which efficiency differences are labor-augmenting, and free trade
in product markets leads to factor price equalization, so that wages are equal across countries
when measured in efficiency units of labor. The estimated gains from removing immigration
restrictions are huge. Using a simple static model of migration costs, the estimated net gains
from open borders are about the same as the gains from a growth miracle that more than doubles
the income level in less-developed countries.

 The biggest reason is his attacks on inequality  




 While all developing countries  from the least developed to middle-income  can celebrate accomplishments in their progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), critical gaps remain. Despite vast diversities, African, Least Developed, Landlocked, Small Island and Middle-Income Countries share, to varying degrees, many common challenges on their path to equitable sustainable development. These include: poverty, growing inequality, hunger, food insecurity, improving public health and education, providing social protection, youth unemployment, migration, urbanization, changing age structures, growing pressures on resources, and climate change. Some countries also face conflict situations or post-conflict fragilities. In many, the globalization of inequality and social exclusion is leading to increased social unrest and dissatisfaction with current models and trends of development. In various cases, these challenges are aggravated and perpetuated by weaknesses in democratic governance and institutional capacity, weak infrastructure, debt burdens, economic crisis, corruption, funding shortfalls, and declines in development cooperation.

This brief focuses on three key pillars for achieving social, economic and environmentally sustainable development:

Advancing the human rights of women and girls and gender equality;
The rights and empowerment of adolescents and youth;
Sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.
These are essential, cross-cutting foundations for a post-2015 people-centred and planet-sensitive development agenda. They are mutually-reinforcing prerequisites for progress, relevant for all countries regardless of their stage of development. They are also smart, effective and cost-saving investments with multiple payoffs across a range of development objectives.

A human rights-based and holistic approach to sustainable development must address multiple dimensions of discrimination and exclusion, including for women and young people as the two largest demographic groups in the world facing inequality and insecurity. Sexual and reproductive health problems  which are preventable  take a huge toll on lives, families, productivity, economies and public budgets. They entrench poverty and erode development prospects, and represent costs and burdens that can and must be lifted. The limited investments in these key areas is a major reason why many of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have not been achievedan important lesson for crafting the post-2015 agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. 




 yea just look at Norway.. richest fucking country on earth.. huge as fuck, land for everyone... most restrictive immigration policies on earth 




 heh i didnt gain from minox imo, felt like it contributed to the shedding.. but obviously studies show it works or whatever.. i dropped it after 6 months or so. didnt notice any extra shedding but the studies show u lose what u gained obviously

 




 dropped it for straight fin ages ago, minox smells terrible, is expensive, u have to apply 2x or 3x / day etc etc 




 Xiao Hai is better than Mark Teddy that's for sure  




 same as being born gay, or watever.. nobody asked for it.. i dunno tho im not a doctor but.. 




 i mean, nobody asked to be born a pedo.. its a curse heh 




 wasnt there an issue with the bot not properly doing something? i forget

 BECAUSE FANBOIS  




 Well obviously hate it because otherwise people will downvote you.  




 Well I did get banned from srsdiscussion yesterday because of my post highlighting racism against Asians. Oh sorry, because the mod didn't like my post history. Just more censorship from the left wing.. Is it any wonder I ended up in "free" speech supporting subs? 

Even complete ideological enemies like /r/European don't ban me..  




 And even today Americans defend Iraq and Afghanistan  




 How does insisting on hiring Americans over Mexicans have nothing to do with nationalism?  




 /r/governmentoppression  




 Cmon in every other thread /r/technology is crying for more battery life  




 And street fighter 4 




 But they can't leave it at that, they have to hate on literally every other fighting game too.. 




 But also all the 9/11 truth  vids I've seen have echoed this point. Freefall was only for 2.25 seconds etc.  




 Hey I'm not defending the NIST report that thing was a mess  




 ive been harassed by cops my entire life. never met an isis member. 




 yea, that was the government. which the TPP will restrict the powers of.. 




 The observed descent time of the upper 18 stories of the north face of WTC 7 (the floors clearly visible in the video evidence) was 40 percent greater than the computed free fall time. A more detailed analysis of the descent of the north face found three stages: (1) a slow descent with acceleration less than that of gravity that corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns at the lower floors, (2) a freefall descent over approximately eight stories at gravitational acceleration for approximately 2.25 s, and (3) a decreasing acceleration as the north face encountered resistance from the structure below.
 




 Even though the lower undamaged structure was designed to be able to handle the upper damaged 18 stories, this is only true in a static sense. Once the loads became dynamic (due to gravity), the dynamic loads had already far exceeded the structural design limit and the failure had to propagate until all the energy is dissipated.

This is true for nearly every structure in existence, and certainly true for every skyscraper: once progressive collapse begins, it can't be stopped because the supporting structure below cannot handle the many multiplications of the load it was designed to support.
 




 they were nationalist socialists.. its pretty damn obvious. modern socialists just hate it when you reference them..

just ask Bernie sanders.. AMERICAN JOBS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT. WE MUST PROTECT THE WORKERS IN THE HOMELAND. 




 you forgot street fighter 4, street fighter 4 unlimited edition ,street fighter 4 alpha, street fighter 4 beta.. 




 a Canadian admits theyre basically Americans  




 because it tastes awful? 




 yea the stock market is rising high on printed new money 




 wish they had wrote TRADES instead of tades lol

also this 2.5 million figure is about 147,500 million off the 15 billion op CITES..

 Hilarious. So many fools think the world's second biggest economy collapsing wouldn't affect them  




 Ya he was innocent the day of his murder  




 Well I posted it in blackfellas because they are the biggest victim of police brutality.. But I admit I tend to be racebaity  




 I'll stop  




 Because nationalism  




 Fuck German Internet Regulation  




 I left ages ago to a place with less police harassment - China  




 China? Whose immense growth has driven a global economic boom and have seen steady wage increases for 30 years.. 

Thank god for trade.  




 I've been disappointed by so many blogs on 9/11, especially watching gage on cspan keep talking about freefall when freefall was clear only for 2 seconds in wtc 7. Please keep posts on 9/11 truth to we'll researched factual information, or we cannot be taken seriously.  




 Ya i dunno much about the thermite in the samples, that seems pretty legit, and I doubt the samples are tampered with, I'm just saying that the process was not very scientific and I'm tired of getting excited for 9/11 truth only to find out the blog I'm reading doesn't bother checking their stuff  




 http://np.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/33tl74/how_did_the_wtc_north_tower_top_section_fall_and/ 




 Seriously? Your argument is that I'm mossad? Don't make me dig up that /r/askengineers thread where they debunk every point /u/lookingfortruths makes.. 

We both want to find the truth behind 9/11, I'm just a bit sticker on research apparently..

 I had my posts about racism on Asians removed today from srsdiscussion (and banned) because I had previously submitted a highly upvotes profreespeech post.. Sigh

Safe spaces are just an excusev 




 Reddit srs cancer spreading across the net  




 Ya Germany is damn fascist about the Internet  




 America is very puritan  




 Ah finally he took a stand on it  




 You mean American companies.. And they already do.  




 Tesla is a huge beneficiary of government funds and subsidies and they are a fucking luxury auto brand goddamnit  




 The TPP let's companies sue the government for harmful regulations. In fact I saw the Guardian arguing it will let companies sue it the state seizes them.. 

Seems fair  




 Also. Why come up with a tax like this.. Political suicide.. 




 Same shit, different fascists  




 When did you realize it was just a dream though? Did you regret it? 




 If she's not fucking you she's not your gf

 They literally measure survival rates in 5 year spans. So even if you survive the cancer 70% with chemo.. That's only for 5 years. Meanwhile your brain is fried  




 You had me until "tastes better" hah  




 At least Jeb supports immigration reform! And fuck this article for attacking NAFTA by saying "day terk mah jobs"  




 Yep. The  basic income folks rarely support basic income for people in Africa or Asia.  




 It's /r/conspiracy you have to sort the wheat from the chaff somehow!  




 And /r/movies didn't even hate on American sniper.. Sad  




 /r/titlegore  




 The government won't prosecute itself seriously we must do it.  




 Everything is a false flag here, including the FPH drama lol. the TPP will bring our world closer together. 




 Even /u/mylespower couldn't explain this except as some jet fuel / elevators dropping.  




 How can you call it a peer reviewed study when it was published in an online journal using years old dust people stored in their homes etc? 

I just wish they had better samples etc. Too bad the government didn't bother running a proper investigation..  




 Dunno it seems to me like this forum has "shut our ears" a bit on the 9/11 issue. I see a ton of convincing evidence that a) only partial freefall and b) the towers collapsed from the fires 

/r/askengineers had a ton of responses to all the 9/12 physics questions.. Too bad I am not qualified to judge who is right. 

That said.. It was just too perfect. inside job!   




 /r/yellowperil  




 yep. its not really going to be in your favor as a man, especially if you are a bit rusty from being married/dating for so long~

but in the end men and women end up having sex with each other , so , be handsome, dont be not handsome~ 




 isnt sexual attraction // fetishes etc based on our experiences? like we can almost decide it ourselves by experimenting etc?

i guess gay people disprove this but..  




 Ya Chinese bans on Google products make more sense now.. (although still mostly protectionism) 




 YOU HATE MEXICANS NOW?? TIME FOR BEN 




 SRS themed game:

CENSOR THE EVIL REDDITOR BEFORE HE CORRUPTS THE CHILDREN 




 yea. i got driven here by SRS censorship when I tried posting in SRSdiscussion about racism against asians.. 

never bothered to check out this sub before, but hey, since im an official enemy why not? 




 i never checked out this sub before, but SRS censorship drove me here. i was literally posting about racism against asians and they still censored me. not a surprise given theyre all white liberals but still..

anyway it would be easy to ban links to voat, just call it a hate-site or whatever the fuck 




 /r/yellowperil for an SRS themed asian issues sub 




 the good posts I make about asian POC issues get deleted.. is it any wonder why i tend to err on the side of free speech?

i literally waited all night to post that because of the submitting limits. sigh.

 ok fair enough. i am mad about getting banned. but i thought this was a great issue and a great place to discuss it. and then, banhammer. 




 well after they removed my last post addressing issues POC face, i messaged them. they warned me to be careful et al, so i was super careful, submitted again. removed and banned.

sigh. making this post probably wont help me get unbanned, but, im a huge defender of POC on reddit ..  wish they would see that and stop getting in the way.. 




 nope, no explanation. and id talked to the mods in PM  a month back so it really came out of the blue when I get banned after submitting a good discussion about hollywood whitewashing..

 28 pages more! 




 the TPP is a free trade agreement that reduces American government power, so for some reason /r/conspiracy is against it 0_o 




 you know when they claim deals are JOB KILLERS waht they really mean is "WAAH WE WANT MORE LABOR PROTECTIONISM" 




 interesting, should add that to the NIST report~ 




 well thats awfully nice of all the engineers to participate!

frankly im afraid that 911 truth is going to have to accept that jet fuel can indeed melt wtc towers and stick to the saudi/cia/mossad part of the conspiracy

dunno tho im just another random on the internet 




 /u/mylespower 




 yea and i hate to detract from any mixed race kids who look identical to white barbies and their struggle but.. 

I think it's Hollywood being business as usual.

 I think NRS is learning from capcom here, they've already started funding a proleague  




 haha i mean what else can u do, shes white as an irish ghost in canada 




 western people dont really do mantra meditation i think, but it sounds interesting.. the breath is so abstract and easy to lose focus

 as if /r/china cares about chinese muslims thats a fucking joke 




 As I'm a visible minority

 But at least we protected the status quo!  




 I thought you fools didn't watch mkx? 




 this sub refused to let me link to their stream ... Pure self fulfilling prophecy.. 




 OK mom  
























 One can show that every developed country was aware of the risk of harm from continued emissions, as early as 1992 and in a number of cases even earlier. And therefore have a moral obligation to help those who have least contributed to the problem, and are most vulnerable to the risks, to adapt to climate change.

Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

What I'm saying is that we are all going to need help. /r/postnationalist Were in this together. 




 Looks like it  




 /r/postnationalist supports muslim rights 




 /r/modelusgov , welcome all participants 




 and since i got banned for mentioning postnationalism in a private blog post, i can see just how well this is gonna work..

 Once Again /r/politics Peddles "DERE TAKING OUR JOBS" http://www.reddit.com/r/postnationalist/comments/3b6h55/once_again_rpolitics_peddles_dere_taking_our_jobs/ 




 White Americans are the biggest terror threat in the United States, according to a study by the New America Foundation. The Washington-based research organization did a review of terror attacks on US soil since Sept. 11, 2001 and found that most of them were carried out by radical anti-government groups or white supremacists.
Almost twice as many people have died in attacks by right-wing groups in America than have died in attacks by Muslim extremists. Of the 26 attacks since 9/11 that the group defined as terror, 19 were carried out by non-Muslims. Yet there are no white Americans languishing inside the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay. And there are no drones dropping bombs on gatherings of military-age males in the country's lawless border regions.
Attacks by right-wing groups get comparatively little coverage in the news media. Most people will struggle to remember the shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin that killed six people in 2012. A man who associated with neo-Nazi groups carried out that shooting. There was also the married couple in Las Vegas who walked into a pizza shop and murdered two police officers. They left a swastika on one of the bodies before killing a third person in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Such attacks are not limited to one part of the country. In 2011, two white supremacists went on a shooting spree in the Pacific Northwest, killing four people.

 Appeal to authority fallacy  




 Anyone talking about "jobs" is just arguing for national socialism  




 Why do Canadians oppose a trade treaty that includes so many of our good friends and allies? 




 Looking at this list of countries why does reddit oppose the TPP so bad.. It's all allies

 And that's different from American culture how?? 

A United globe is the future. /r/postnationalist  




 Because America is too stupid to vote for it  




 How is the TPP fascism? 




 The real conspiracy is how many anti-Tpp articles this sub gets without a single pro TPP article  




 It'd simultaneously a secret but being attacked on specifics? 




 Trade leads to peace.. Nationalist protectionism leads to war  




 Why does removing government power make something fascism? 




 Ya it's like people think the corporations don't run it already.. At least the TPP will be good for trade  




 why is /r/conspiracy so distrusting of governments except when it comes to the TPP removing their sovereignty.. 




 AnythingGoes 




 thats because your chinese accents are so bad.. 




 westerners always deny refugees because it costs too much money.. 




 whats the greens stance?

 bit different than usual posts but hope u guys like it 




 Given the kind of low bandwidth conversation we often have about immigrants ('assimilation' vs. 'multiculturalism'); the title could be a touch misleading to today's audience. The author is arguing that there is not an indigenous American culture (Indians aside) and that immigrant cultures have helped to create a fertile, pioneering spirit that is the genius of the US. What is believed to be indigenous is a shallow Anglophilia and a coarse transient popular culture. Forcing immigrants to adopt these "rudimentary" characteristics would lead to stagnation in the US.
"It is not the Jew who sticks proudly to the faith of his fathers and boasts of that venerable culture of his who is dangerous to America, but the Jew who has lost the Jewish fire and become a mere elementary, grasping animal. It is not the Bohemian who supports the Bohemian schools in Chicago whose influence is sinister, but the Bohemian who has made money and has got into ward politics. Just so surely as we tend to disintegrate these nuclei of nationalistic culture do we tend to create hordes of men and women without a spiritual country, cultural outlaws, without taste, without standards but those of the mob." 




 They are in there, often unnoticed. The words that have become part of everyday English. Loot, nirvana, pyjamas, shampoo and shawl; bungalow, jungle, pundit and thug.

What are the roots, and routes, of these Indian words? How and when did they travel and what do their journeys into British vernacular  and then the Oxford English Dictionary  tell us about the relationship between Britain and India?

Long before the British Raj  before the East India Company acquired its first territory in the Indian subcontinent in 1615  South Asian words from languages such as Hindi, Urdu, Malayalam and Tamil had crept onto foreign tongues. One landmark book records the etymology of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases. Compiled by two India enthusiasts, Henry Yule and Arthur C Burnell, Hobson-Jobson: The Definitive Glossary of British India was published in 1886. The poet Daljit Nagra described it as not so much an orderly dictionary as a passionate memoir of colonial India. Rather like an eccentric Englishman in glossary form. 




 do you have any sources/figures on this effect? im interested in it

id say foreign investment is a good thing overall but i can see this creating resentment surely

 One participant commented that he was not even aware that he had reduced his smoking so much while going about his daily activities.

The researchers also conducted brain scans of participants before and after the training regiments, finding that at resting state, participants in the meditation group had increased activity in the anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex brain areas. These regions are part of the brain network related to self-control capacity.

 Why is it radical to shoot back at American drones?

 pass a scientific peer review? are you kidding? look /r/conspiracy , you have to stop playing fast and loose with the facts.. i love you all but..  




 please point out the inaccuracy of my statement 




 don't bother asking that, (I do believe there was some form of conspiracy on 9/11, just saying), they never answer you.. 




 no see, there were red flakes in some dust samples that a lady stored in her house for 5 years before mailing off to a 9/11 guy to "publish" a "paper" in an online journal".. therefore nano-thermite! 




 america would do this too.. need a license for everything in the land of the free 




 k will remember keep britishpolitics posts discussion/effort 




 yea not a big fan of alex jones but hey.. fuck the border police~ 




 finally the casino loses. also funny to read in that article that bryan micon only got fined 25,000$ for running an unlicensed gaming operation.. guess he wasn't very profitable? 




 /r/postnationalist , fuck border police 




 meanwhile the UK is deporting nurses.. 




 this is actually a good use case for bitcoin, though. anywhere the government/banks don't let us operate, bitcoin becomes useful. 




 fuck UKIP /r/britishpolitics 




 and the TPP removes their sovereignty. but somehow that's a bad thing? 




 /r/postnationalist 




 because we don't let in any immigrant doctors or nurses

/r/postnationalist  




 /r/postnationalist 




 awesome please do! be happy to help fix it up too.. hope it can be a bit of a community document. 




 ladies of the night arent gonna hodl.. they want $
 




 this is actually one of the few good use cases for bitcoin -- when governments/banks start fucking with you 




 yea but who is gonna pay for Ellen Pao if we don't let them monetize us harder? 




 Basically any system can be tampered with though.. At least evoting gets more people involved  




 /r/postnationalist  




 If a "terrorist" wanted to cross from Canada to the USA it must be the easiest thing ever to avoid border patrols.. Just swim.. Or walk.. Etc 




 I can try.. Anyone have suggestions for stuff to add?  




 Samsung just can't compete anymore - all the Chinese manufacturers also copy apple and sell for half the price.. 




 oh please. OP is ranting about outsourcing and jobs going overseas. that has nothing to do with confession of an economic hitman. all it is is code-words for American nationalism. 




 same with most of the west.. its called "hitting your peak" [and rich people getting richer] 




 r u fucking serious? reddit is all anti-TPP, all the time.. every sub-reddit.. if anything id say reddit is shilling against foreign labor ~ 




 can we stop saying "ITS NOT ABOUT X, ITS ABOUT Y"
 
tomorrows post:

ITS NOT ABOUT JAMES HOLMES, ITS ABOUT THE TPP 




 not like they ever answer them..

Victoria gets my respect if she fought the commercialization, but she was already part of the problem.. her teaching the celebs how to shill their products more effectively at us.. 




 censored? 




 most AMA questions are shill/handpicked 




 I thought the problem was the fertilizers? 




 what kind of treatments did they do? 




 hah your stateless brothers 









 Plus all that bitch did was use her dank memes skills to shill celebrity products at us, fuck her  




 Join the OGs  




 /r/postnationalist if you're not already  




 The one that bitches about American government losing sovereignty to the TPP  




 /r/postnationalist supports inter-racial marriage  




 Don't we all? 




 So poor people are fucked? 




 You don't believe the Iraq war was about)$$? 




 YA the TPP is basically creating Oceania lol 




 Hi,? 




 China is cheap and safe and civilized  




 Wow  




 Humanity is just a step on the evolutionary ladder  




 /r/postnationalist 
 




 I've read all that too.. But.. Not conclusive. Is the fbi still hiding their results of the investigation or did they just not try hard enough? 




 Ask China how being "cheap labor" works.. Pretty well, actually (although income inequality is still a problem) 




 The interesting thing is how much this sub defends American sovereignty and "democracy" only when comes to the TPP and otherwise never  




 I'd rather be a waiter... Manufacturing sucks  




 Weird, she was such a good shill too.. 




 I'm safe! 




 What a waste of $ 




 Someone should........ 




 Vatican jesuits? What  




 And also pushing for unity between twelve nations, all allies.  




 The nwo is coming... If it doesn't ww3 will come instead  




 

So people overseas don't matter? Outsourcing makes tons of economic sense. Specialization. A global world is our future. Stop screwing poor foreign  people and focus on the rich fuckers.. 




 Sounds hilarious  




 This should be all over the real news soon if true!! 




 This sub is honestly not as big on research as you'd think.. Sometimes I get disappointed  




 The producers of it. Same as natural news benefits from fear mongering and I benefit by pointing out the obvious  




 Cheaper labor is people too  




 Heh if you proved it you'd have the story of the century..  




 yep 




 why do u require a source for this but not for what op says

because you are biased

but any expat community of dutch people is the obvious source 




 im not the one who thinks this is the key to unmasking anything

if you really believed that, make it so yourself! figure out his name, and call him.. hell a simple google search might turn his name up..
 




 break up with her 




 oh nothing to do with all the spying on everyone google does and their NSA connections?? please.. 




 don't do it man, just find a new gf 




 if she cant quit drinking so much it doesn't matter what you do.. 




 gamut 




 bankers would let them cancel their debts? 




 I think it was a genius way, to make it democratic 




 yea if people ask a scot out in public he can only say yes, right?  




 Could easily track down the dude.. 




 Fuck borders /r/postnationalist  




 When Dutch move abroad they also create a "parallel society" 




 Sounds like the UK  




 Britain already gave police broad dispersal powers  




 The government investigated those men heavily.. What did they find?  




 I mean just because they couldn't model it on computer doesn't mean it didn't happen.. I haven't seen any 911truth computer models either..  




 In China here, any moron can get a 20$/hour teaching job  




 YA it's amazing how stupid that statement is  




 The farm lobby is a government subsidized mess that punishes overseas workers.. I hope chomsky didn't defend the American farmer.. They have enough advocates  




 If the argument is the US pharmaceutical lobby will gain control in the USA.. I'm very lost  




 If anything state government is more corrupt.. 




 so fucking what? are we arguing regulations work now? do we believe in our government now?

if you ran a company and suddenly it got outlawed (THINK: UBER), wouldn't you like to have some rights too? 




 When I ask for a nickel-free earring because I noticed that nickel causes a rash and inflammation on my ear, no one hysterically accuses me of being "anti-earring". When you are evaluating the messages here, which you must do for the sake of your child's health, think about this:


--98% of people who want to get thimerasol out of vaccines are NOT "Anti-Vaccine" they want vaccines to be safer


--And yet, you will notice that there are hysterical straw men arguments made accusing people who want safer vaccines to be 'anti-vaccine'.
Start there. Why would ANYONE slam the parent of an autistic or brain-injured child and misrepresent their story and their wish unless they had an either religious fervor about vaccines or a financial interest or a desparate wish to hide the truth? If they are really concerned that people will stop vaccinating if they learn that vaccines have dangerous ingredients, then why not join us in making vaccines safer? There is no explanation for their rabid denial that poisons in vaccines are not a good idea, and their continual misrepresenation of this. Excpet a desparate wish to avoid blame or financial loss. Or simply a desparate wish to be correct.

 But what motivates parents of vaccine injured children and environmentalists like RFK Jr? Common sense and dozens of studies you can find in his book. And a wish to never see another babbling child anywhere in the world, become silent, as so many parents of mercury -poisoned have. It's a poison. Its in vaccines. Get it out! Enough said!!!! 




 at the bare minimum its about pharma contracts 




 I could never find any actual studies showing much disease from vaccinations except the thimerol stuff.. 




 that's a weird negotiating strategy.. 




 sometimes I admit I get a bit too conspiracy minded, hell I even did holocaust research (6 million jews did not die!) , but im not going to touch flat earth lol.. ive flown so many small airplanes.. 




 if someone could prove this, and it would be fucking easy, every scientist on earth would suddenly shit a brick

its not a conspiracy.. 




 for the flat earth conspiracy to be true, like 50% of humanity and anyone who has ever rode an airplane has to be in on it 




 Indeed, despite the often-decried undercurrent of Social Darwinism in Heinlein's science fiction, there also exists a significant dallying with transnational political organizations. Heinlein's idealism and pragmatism concerning international relations constantly temper each other, often producing entities that, if not necessarily ideals of charity and brotherhood, at least are not mindless predatory organisms but instead are commonsensical and neighborly. Heinlein seems to suggest - correctly, I believe - that without collective security we could find ourselves at the mercy of the real Social Darwinists.

 Heinlein's work with transnational organizations can be grouped into four main categories: the earlier, more idealistic novels such as Space Cadet (1948), which incorporate fairly successful transnational organizations that often attempt not only to keep the peace but to do other good as well, saving lives and protecting individual rights, all the while supported by generally democratic political infrastructures; the later, more cautiously internationalist novels exemplified by Have Space Suit - Will Travel (1958) and Glory Road (1963), wherein organizations consciously limit themselves to an often more pragmatic peacekeeping; the infrequent warnings against governmental intrusion, like Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (1966); and, of course, the occasional pieces like Farmer in the Sky (1950) and Time for the Stars (1956), which merely employ some basically unexamined form of world government as a conventionalized science fictional backdrop. Though in 1958 Heinlein wrote to his agent decrying the naivete of the "starry-eyed internationalists" who urged disarmament and who longed for a "world state" (Grumbles 210), in his own work Heinlein himself apparently cannot help longing for some sort of transnational peacekeeping entity, albeit often a more practical one.

 globalism is the future. why do we divide our tiny group of humans into nations? 




 so you think the government is doing a good job or what? 




 apparently a no-carb diet starves the cancers..  




 do u have any studies on vaccines causing harm? recent stuff?  




 is what we have in America any better? lets bring the world together, so we fight less wars.. 




 because the common clay of America fucking hates foreign nations  




 I know not everyone here is an anarchist of course, I dunno what I am personally 




 We hate American government  until the TPP removes American sovereignty then we are all "democracy" "corporate takeover"  




 Yep!  




 Welcome to the list

 "The fundamental error Chandler makes in this video is that the "unloading" of the upper floors' weight on the lower half only occurs until the the upper floors impact it. The impact, if you want to use the "block" analogy , is much greater that the original static load and it impacts on only one floor in this simple model. If this implact is greater than the floors ability to withstand it (it's dynamic load rating) then the floor will come apart. (I'm not arguing the model, as it's kind of silly, just that even if you try to use it, his conclusions ignore this point.)

Try this simple math - let the upper 13 floors weigh one pound each, so the weight pressing down on the "lower block" is 13 pounds on 9/10/2001. The detached upper block accelerates on 9/11/2991 for 12 (distance between floors) feet at 18 feet per second (Chandler's video) so the terminal velocity of the block is roughly10 feet per second. F=1/2 MV^2, so the thirteen blocks exert an impact of (13*10*10)/2=650 lbs on the top floor of the block. If this is greater than the design load of the floor - or its weakest links, then it will come apart at those points. Note the huge difference between 13 and 650 in terms of load. The next floor impact is even worse as the constant acceleration means that the velocity is greater (from Chandler) and so the force is even greate by the SQUARE of the velocity (and the mass might be up by a bit too).

 I was kind of shocked at the number of kids we had that believed this shit when I was studying civil engineering. That probably explains why they got C's or D's in dynamics though!

I'll elaborate slightly. I don't build or design buildings. I build roads; they're what I know and am good at. However, I have taken two structural analysis and design courses, as well as a steel design course, so I imagine that puts me at or above 98% of the general public when it comes to understanding how the towers fell. 

Here goes; when you build a building there's basically two types of loadings you'll design for: static and dynamic. Static loadings are the loads on a structure that don't change; desks, computers, filing cabinets, the actual weight of the building itself, stuff like that. Dynamic loadings are a bit trickier as they can move; people, water from rain/snow on the roof, wind, seismic, etc. You get the idea. 

I'm not certain on the Factor of Safety (FOS) used for the Towers' design, but let's assume it was 2. What that means is in a static situation, all other things being equal and there being no dynamic forces acting on the building (a perfect classroom scenario, obviously not real world), you'd basically be able to stack one tower on top of the other and it would be able to support it. 

It gets trickier with dynamic loading because in theory you could have all of the weight focused on a minute point, which you obviously couldn't design for as it would require truly massive structural members to support so dynamic FOS is, let's say, 1.1. 

Once the first floor started to accelerate downwards, the was nothing that could stop the floor below it from failing immediately after the dynamic load hit it. Now you've got two floors falling, then three, and so on. For the buildings to be sturdy enough to handle a moving weight like that falling even 10 feet would require gargantuan beams. I'm taking beams that are 4 feet tall (looking at it where it makes an "I") and weigh several hundred pounds per foot. Something that heavy could not support itself. 

Another thing to mention is the whole steel beams thing. Everyone needs to shut the hell up about "jet fuel can't melt steel beams" bullshit. It didn't have to melt the beams. All it had to do was weaken them. Steel loses 70% of its tensile strength at only 25-30% of it's melting point, which was definitely reached during the fires. For those of you playing along at home, that would mean the building would have had to have been built with an FOS of 4 or more, which is not feasible financially, and quite possibly structurally. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention that our quality control standards in the 70's weren't nearly as good as they are today. Is venture as well that the quality of the materials used aren't as good as they are now. 

I know only a few will see this, but I hope it might help you explain it to the layman that believes all of this bullshit.

 OPERATION STREAMLINE: There is one lawyer for all 23 men. Federal public defender Matthew Johnson says he's handled up to 50 defendants by himself in one day. Compare this with defenders in Tucson, where each lawyer may represent four to six clients at a time. 




 id be happy too if i was born in a country that controlled 1% of all wealth on earth despite being .00083% of the population! 




 Acts of civil disobedience are in line with the principles of equality that governed my life  I felt I had an obligation to use my skills for justice and bring the truth to light, he said.

But Judge Preska disagreed with Hammond that his hacktivism was a form of civil disobedience.

"These were not the actions of Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, John Adams or even Daniel Ellsberg [who handed over the Pentagon Papers], said Preska in closing. In his own words, Mr. Hammond had a stated goal of creating maximum mayhem.

Among other items, Hammond was found guilty of the Dec. 2011 hack into the computer systems of global intelligence firm Strategic Forecasting Inc., or Stratfor. Speaking about that hack, Preska had equally strong words.

His goal was, citing Hammond's own words at the time, to destroy the target, hoping for bankruptcy, collapse."

 sorry im not gonna bother using archive whatever cuz ur dumbass cant handle a link to eventhubs 




  -labor is divided. the illegal immigrants/furriners are used as a bargaining chip to push down the wages for the local people, and the answer is NOT to join forces with your employer against the foreign labor

 




 **super alpha postnationalism FAQ**

-founded as a counter-jerk to the prevailing western attitude- against foreigners, against outsourcing, against immigrants, which i believe is mostly founded on a "fuck you got ours" 

ie: "socialist" norway, 1 trillion $ oil fund, huge landmass, still no room for immigrants. australias white immigration policy, americas 10 year waiting lists etc.

-veganism says species:discrimination, we declare some species lower and then eat them. the same thing happens with our global caste system.

-labor is divided. the illegal immigrants are used as a bargaining chip to push down the wages for the local people, and the answer is NOT to join forces with your employer against the foreign labor

-US vs THEM mentality, ww3, hitler. nationalism leads to war over scarce resources. dehumanizing other nations peoples and demanding your nation is #1 etc. 

**WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF POSTNATIONALISM?**

united globe, be it under global government or what. people can move freely around. indians and americans and africans are equal. 

Dont just Take my word for it, look at the top 5 all time posts:

 mantra meditation actually works, and is way easier to focus on than 'the breath' 




 Cmon wouldn't u block the dude who spammed Facebook on a single topic? I would.. 




 Sounds like a match made in heaven( for the bankers) 




 Considering juice costs them pennies to make.. 




 I came to this sub to find an ecig what I found instead was a bunch of salesmen slandering each other.. 




 not to mention income tax was specifically deemed unconstitutional by the supreme court.. and never passed thru congress 




 NEW ZEALAND NOW HAS WARRANTS OUT FOR THE ARREST OF 50% OF AMERICAN 14 YEAR OLD BOYS 




 yea thats kind of what were getting at  




 especially since you made it private.. 




 im not saying u cant pay the people..  




 We believe foremost that if someone but simply wishes to learn, they have every right to access the highest forms and modes of education available on this planet; since this is not a reality we must begin somewhere.
This is why we also believe that if someone but simply wishes to read any book, they should have access to that book for free no matter what. 




 why not?  




 mean comments are definitely the average online

 pretty funny how they never actually passed congress saying we should pay income tax and instead just let the IRS decide 




 An argument made in the film is that there is no reason why the Federal Reserve System should have a monopoly on the U.S. money supply. The film asserts that "America got along just fine before the Federal Reserve came into existence." This leads the film to the question of why the Federal Reserve System was created. The film contends that the U.S. Congress has no control or oversight over the Fed, and hence has no control over the value of U.S. money. The film argues that Congressional control over the value of money is required by Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution. The phrase in question (clause 5) states that the United States Congress shall have the power "To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin..." The film includes a call to action to abolish the Federal Reserve. In 2007, the Boston Globe stated that Congressman Ron Paul, "says he doesn't agree with all the film's arguments, but he says the film had 'a huge impact' on the support his campaign is drawing",[2] a reference to Paul's presidential bid in 2007 and 2008.

 MAGIC MISSILE  




 Chinese manufacturers got the same product for half price anyway, absolutely no reason to buy Samsung anymore.

 too bad the bot drivers are completely useless and cant keep pointed at their enemy  




 im in china near Shenzhen , lets go together 




 got to say, so fucking disappointed in this show. reddit hyped it up mad hard, then I watch these shitty robots doing no damage to each other and occasionally getting hit by a plastic hammer..

 In the past couples didnt have a choice about whether or not to stay together; they were forced to by circumstance and the need for survival. We glamorize marriages from the past by pretending that people voluntarily stayed together, instead of acknowledging that the majority of people didnt have alternatives. In fact, many marriages in the past were not only highly dysfunctional, but highly abusive. So feeling nostalgic for the perfect marriages of the past is like feeling nostalgic for the time when money grew on trees. 




 its kind of a conspiracy of society in a way. the media, the church, government.. all pushing us to stay in these marriages and get married etc... 




 yea it might not be an actual conspiracy per se 




 yea its all societal construct 




 the media created the myth of marriage and we each buy into it by playing our gender roles 




 fuck you flytape covered in flies!

she basically describes how she gave up her own desires in order to make her husband happy. She also says that if she were to do things over again, she would guard the things that she enjoys and the things that make her feel like herself.19


Women do give up much of who they are, but the reason is to accomplish their dream. Yet after they get what they want, women forget this fact and mistakenly think that they have given up and sacrificed in order to make their husbands happy.

I agree with Armstrong that marriage is the greatest conspiracy in modern history. However, in truth men dont fare any better than women, and to believe anything else is merely to buy into the conspiracy. 














 its basically just a woman writing about how women want sex too

 France is barely holding on, Germany is benefitting from a weak euro.. they are all super over-regulated 




 europe is saddled with regulations across the entire continent, killing jobs, protecting interest groups and getting in the way

 I'm getting more and more into Canadian politics and some popularly held views I come across are very strange for me, one of which being the whole niqab-while-taking-citizenship-oaths thing. I don't mean to be offensive but I just can't seem to understand the line of thinking behind the view. 

Feedom of expression exists for the things we don't like, the ones we like don't need protection. I'm personally against any type of hijab but I realize that it's just not my call to make. It's their body and they should be able to decide what to wear. I just simply don't understand how people who say they stand for freedom want to ban certain types of clothing from some events. 

Thanks!

The Over-policing of Dominican Hair
Just recently, Morgan Miller published an article for American Quarterly, decrying her experience as an African-American woman with natural hair in the Dominican Republic. Morgan traveled to the Dominican Republic expecting a respite from the racism she experienced in her native United States. She arrived in a poor tropical island fully unaware of her own country's imposition of a political pigmentocracy vis--vis their training and backing of dictator Rafael Trujillo. 

Robert Crassweller in Trujillo: The Life and Times of a Caribbean Dictator writes of racial relations before Trujillo's rise to power. Crassweller stresses that in the Dominican Republic, the color line barely existed (149). A preference for good hair was the limit of racial awareness and indeed it was not unusual for a very dark man to be successful and receive full public acceptance in the highest circles of public life. Crassweller further adds that the ancient hostilities between the Dominican Republic and Haiti were national and public, not private and personal. Trujillo, whose own grandmother was Haitian, found it more convenient to antagonize the two peoples in order to pose as the savior of one.

 Seeking Refuge

"Now that Bitcoin exists, we hope that Greek workers and merchants can use it to protect their income through this crisis."
- BitPay business development manager Pablo Magro.
To fight inflation, Latin Americans have historically stored their wealth in American dollars. The increasing restrictions some countries have placed on buying dollars have left these citizens financially vulnerable.

In Argentina, even though government restrictions were somewhat relaxed after the peso experienced a sudden drop in value in 2014, those who are approved to buy dollars are limited to purchasing just 20% of their income, capping their monthly savings at $2,000.

Getting this approval is a cumbersome process, leaving most Argentines with a higher restriction barrier to exchange their local currency. However, the numbers are rising from $39.2m p/day bought in June to $60m p/day bought in July, forcing the government to tighten the restrictions.

Extreme restrictions on currency exchange have led to the emergence of a black market specifically for trading pesos for dlar blue, American dollars with an exchange rate that runs about 50% higher than the official exchange rate.

Acquiring dollars this way is illegal and risky, so Argentines seeking to protect their savings often buy ADRs (American Depository Receipts), local bonds denominated in dollars, gold, silver, and other commodities that are traded on local and international stock exchanges.

No Bank Account? No Problem.

News of bank closures in Greece in the past month have sparked panic, then bank runs, leaving many Greek citizens without regular access to their bank accounts.

For Latin Americans, this situation is already too familiar. Among Latin America's 600 million inhabitants, more than 60% are unbanked, meaning they have no access to bank accounts.

Despite the obvious economic need, most financial institutions are unable to serve this unbanked population.

Fortunately, purchasing and using bitcoin does not require a bank account. All it takes is just a mobile phone, which 70% of Latin Americans happen to have. In contrast to the banking system, the Bitcoin network operates 24 hours a day, every day of the year, and can be accessed by anyone on the internet. It presents an immediate, accessible solution to receive wages and securely store savings at very low cost, with no additional resources or hardware required.

Entrepreneurs and companies have already begun to make bitcoin solutions available to consumers in the region. Belize's Advanced Cash is particularly significant example, accepting bitcoin payments for top-ups to its popular digital wallets and prepaid cards which are used throughout Latin America. This mainstream integration of bitcoin payments is allowing both banked and unbanked customers to secure their savings in the cloud.
