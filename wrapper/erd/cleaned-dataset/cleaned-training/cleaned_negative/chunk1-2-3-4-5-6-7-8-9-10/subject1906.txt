 are the Muslim extremists? sorry, too soon Ik.

Seriously though, these 'sound' as though acts of true desperation. It is not as though NK has a lot of allied countries.

Worrisome as the economic situations of the poor keep plummeting in so many places globally. 




 ' "This action is an unjustified provocation against the feelings of 1.5 billion Muslims," the authority, Dar al-Ifta, said." '.

Get over it already! If you don't like what you see either stop looking at it or out your own eyeballs. Stop attempting to dictate what other people choose to think/draw/write/imagine/love/teach/wear/believe/and so on   on   on etc.

The Heart Of The World-The Elder Brothers Warning (documentary The Kogi Elder)    http://vimeo.com/103812927   
  About: ""The Heart of The World: Elder Brother's Warning was filmed by Alan Ereira for the BBC in 1991
"In a desperate attempt to prevent further ecological catastrophe and destruction, the Kogi Mamas broke their silence and allowed a small BBC film crew into their isolated mountaintop civilization to hear their message and warning to Younger Brother (those (un)conscious people who mashing up our environment). The subsequent messages and warnings were voiced in this documentary. After the documentary was filmed, the Kogi Mamas returned to their work in isolation and asked outsiders to not come to their land.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Kogi soon realized that their message and warning had not been heeded by Younger Brother, and instead, as they had predicted, many catastrophes occurred and the natural world continued to be devastated at an even more rapid pace.[7] In turn they contacted the same filmmaker twenty years later to give one final message. This became Aluna, a documentary made by the Kogi Mamas themselves in which they give a second warning and say that they have chosen to share their secret sciences with Younger Brother so that Younger Brother can help change the world for the better."

  The Pass was actually confirmed as results of an avalanche

 That is what you said initially.   
  Then you tossed in a Wiki page, the first sentence of which refers to 'avalanche' as "plausible":"but avalanche damage is considered one of the more plausible explanations for this incident.[4]"

 It goes on: "Possibly negating the avalanche scenario is that investigators saw footprints leading from the campsite, with no obvious avalanche damage noted."

 /u/Iamnotyours makes a very good point regarding these 2 incidents.

 oh my, have to agree.
 "PETA euthanizes nearly 90 percent of the animals it takes in, a rate often criticized by other animal groups. PETA defends its practices, referring to itself as a shelter of last resort - a place that provides a merciful death for animals too sick, old or otherwise unfit for adoption.

But state regulations call for a minimum holding period of five days, said Debra Griggs, president of the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies. Pickups are also required to be reported to a locality's animal control.

"In Maya's case, PETA did neither of those things," Griggs said. "It's a serious violation."

Aside from that, she said, the video shows "a happy, healthy, sweet dog on its own property, and that flies in the face of everything we believe in - not only about our pets but our property rights in general."

 Opinions are influenced by one's gender though, IMHO.  

Forced wearing of the hijab, or of any other enforced clothing, will often have gender-specific reactions as to 'how important is it?', as an example.

Let me see what people are saying..ah ok, here ya go: http://www.ted.com/conversations/23808/how_does_gender_affect_formula.html

oh and 'gender bias' is a thing. Google. 




 The hijab is a VERY obvious sign of the oppression of the female populace, it those countries where it's wearing is not a choice.  




 Google always thinks I am a male.

 Here is the problem.  Young Michael Brown was a tall, large teenager, he looked like a grow man, ' he was 6' 4" (1.93 m) tall and weighed 292 lb (132 kg).

Mr. Brown was 18 years of age. An adult.

I can understand how intimidating a young man of that size might be.

Michael may or may not have been a bully; reports say he was much better than that, but the video!!

I give my warmest heart felt condolences to his parents, family, friends.

I know of no one with a perfect child; we are each   every one, simply human.

Now why burn down you town?  Honest it is a very bad reflection on the black/white relationships here in the USA.

Please calm down out there, peaceful protest will garner far more support than the videos of a liqueur store being broken into,the toy store, the etc. shops.

sorry  am rambling, it sucked to have to call my son (working in a Newark hospital, just to review the 'if you get stopped by an officer keep your hands in plain site on your steering wheel. If you are asked for ID tell the officer that you will need to reach into you back pocket, ask is that ok?  Always speak respectfully." 

If you should get arrested, call your parents! You are entitled to a call.
Keep your mouth shut until you have  a lawyer, say nothing.

But for goodness sake , the images of looting in the community liqueur store, toy r us, etc you all are setting back race relations like 50 years!! 

Just stop the stupidity, fires do not help.
 




 ty, my son is working ER rotation in Newark Nj tonight.  I appreciate all news. 




 thanks.
 




 can you share those please? 




 oh. That makes sense somehow, thanks:) 









 I paid my rent, gave my son a 125 check   took him out for an inexpensive dinner for his birthday,  ( he is in school). I spent 25$ to renew antiviral, bought some little food, am basically ok atm.

But I am literally down to pennies, and was wondering if I could borrow 35$ from someone until my next pay day, 11/21.

I know many are in much more need, I am happy to have a roof, a wonderful child, lights   internet access, but naturally all my grand planning has left out a few odd things like a prescription renewal, and that cup of coffee I usually buy before my 12 hour work days a couple of times a week. 

I have no idea how this works, how money gets moved about, but scouts honor I will pay back the 35 next Friday the 21st (will probably be after work, like 8pm ish est)

I have had backpackwayne added as a friend for ages, unbeknownst to him, as at one point I was having terrible trouble finding a job that could pay my rent in nyc, and he was so wonderful in offering advice and listening to my laments!  (so now I rent a room in jersey city btw).

Not a druggie, not a drunk, work at low $ job atm, planted daffodils (free from the city), love life, love my family, love tghis sub, and always wish I could help more. 

Anyway I thank you for your consideration. Would be greatly appreciated! (lol though I warn you again, I will need to have it explained how this actually works:)

Thank you all amazing people!

 Teen Driver Charged In Hit-And-Run Death Of Ariel Russo, 4, Accused Of Dragging Police Officer
September 3, 2014 5:05 PM 














 I'm an American with deep respect for the members of our military. Today I have heard countless people wishing others a "Happy" Veteran's Day. When I think about my great uncle's mustard gas poisoning; what my father saw liberating concentration camps   afterwards, returning with yellow fever from Panama; my brother's stories of being dropped behind enemy lines in Vietnam..well I just weep, and say a very quiet 'thank you'.  I can't seem to bring myself to think of Veteran's Day as 'happy' knowing the hell so many have gone through. While it was still armistice day, I can see people using 'happy', but now? My question is this: What sentiment would you folk like to hear on Veteran's Day, today   in the future?   thank you all. 




 I just came online, and my multi bar is gone. Anyone else getting this? Any clues why this has occurred? 




 My Italian aunt (mom's sister) has always told me that my father's father was 'black Irish'. Now I have gone on the assumption that this meant he had dark hair/brown eyes, possibly a remnant (in my eyes) of that dang Roman invasion of ages ago.   However! I have searched 'black Irish' here   in r/history   r/Irish history   /r/ Irish....only to find that Montserrat video:(   So! Please historians, more in depth info pretty please??? 
























 Someone please explain why I need to wait 8 minutes between saying "that's old" and saying "you all seriously need to stop making me laugh, my computer is getting nervous.  
And yes, you do totally win!"

umm seriously, tell me what is it that I am doing too much?  '

(after my original wait time expired said"no nipples?" to the naked woman/man poster. Still was required to wait another 8 min.)  WHY???

also what is the FC named? May take me until tomorrow to ask that here. And yes I saw the side post link, put it did not work on this differently advantaged comp of mine. 



























































 I haven't received any notice to go to court, just a letter from landlord's lawyer telling me to pay or they will begin court proceedings. I know I will have to go, but am so afraid of an immediate lock-out.  

Will I get any time to finish packing?  

Please help, I need info!!! 









 Seem's to me I read BBC, CNN, Huff.post and just see redigested news I read here first. (BBC is actually much better, please forgive me). MSNBC also seems so slow.

http://history1900s.about.com/od/famouscrimesscandals/a/rasputin.htm 




 yea that really surprised me seeing those two little sections. 




 I suppose IF in fact the statements are false he could. That is a big IF though. 
Also IDK if there is a warrant for the arrest of an adult is that considered open to public knowledge? I would think so; I'm not a lawyer though.

Edit many hours later, fyi:  ( yea from wiki:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_defamation_law)
"Defamation law in modern practice:
Defamation law in the United States is much less plaintiff-friendly than its counterparts in European and the Commonwealth countries, due to the enforcement of the First Amendment"....etc bla bla...
  "One defense is reporting or passing through information as a general information or warning of dangerous or emergent conditions, and intent to defame must be proven. Also, the truth of the allegedly defamatory statement will always negate the claim (whether because the plaintiff fails to meet his/her burden of proving falsity or because the defendant proves the statement to be true).[11]"

so you see? the burden of proof of innocence often appears to fall upon the plaintiff in these cases.  

"Libel is a method of defamation expressed by print, writing, pictures, signs, effigies, or any communication embodied in physical form that is injurious to a person's reputation, exposes a person to public hatred, contempt or ridicule, or injures a person in his/her business or profession." fromhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/libel

I want to be real clear here that I am in no way standing up for a pedos nor anyone else's right to harm children. Nor am I presuming the perhaps defamed, originally accused (Joe if u lost track) man to be guilty.   

 




 yea they have a kind of old school sound. lol def not electro-pop.

 They claim to have found after taking the computer from the Joe guys brother, and taking this brother's word that Joe was the one that down loaded it?

Then waiting 6 years before looking at the evidence on the computer??

I think there is room for doubt, due to the inept handling of this case from start to the current state of affairs which I hope is not the end. 




 yes stunning isn't it? It's just morally incomprehensible. And not just the policing side, the DA side of things smells so bad I rather think a higher level of investigation on this entire fiasco should be conducted. 




 Idk if we need boots really as much as robos to build things like weapons systems and mining ops. 




 The entire story seems a fiasco! They seized Joe's computer based on his brother's say so? then...
 "For nearly six years, nothing happened. Its not clear why, but perhaps because the original detective retired in 2007.

The computer sat at the state police Computer Crimes Unit in Lansing without being forensically examined. A note in the file in 2007 shows state police couldnt find the search warrant or consent form to search it. By 2008, records show, state police were considering destroying the evidence after a review of the complaint showed issues over burden of proof" "

So for 6 years this accused pedo was allowed free reign!!! (on his upgraded computer no doubt). Outrageous.

The arresting the wrong guy part is the least of it almost, though I have to ask, if they thought  Dean was the man, they (thankfully as it turned out) allowed him to remain in a home with 4 children?  

ok brain is broken now, too much lack of logic for me in this story. 




 Billy Dean Rowe being the one falsely accused.

Though who the hell knows, maybe they both are innocent. Seems everything else was majorly botched, so I can't put a lot of stock in the supposed confession that the Billy Joe guy is purported to have made. This is one messed up story.

There was a poppy nailed to the wall?

Surely an about-when can be determined as to when this was built. Maybe it was built as a rudimentary shelter from either bombs or weather?

Also btw, it is illegal to sell off personal papers/photos generally.  I have personal knowledge as well of at least 2 people contacting the buyer and making an arrangement for the return of their stuff. 




 Wow, thank you:) 




 this one would even work with mixed races. We could have 'nigllas' and 'chinllas' (lol also apparently a picturesque place in Peru),; even chingers (hmm another one that is already a word, so idk), etc.

 Well you know the whole Russian attitude toward homosexuality   all that:) 




 When certain substances such as corticosteroids   opioids are introduced exogenously I believe the body decreases endogenous production in response over the course of time. 

Were we able to develop formulas for individualized optimum levels of various neurotransmitters, and introduce some sort of bio-sensor coupled with IDK, nanotechnology I suppose,  able to block/release the assorted neurotransmitters in response to the bio-sensors readings.. then we could potentially all be an emotionally stable, happy happy army I suppose.

 As I understood it when I got nosy during the Steve Jobs Brazilian wheelchair pic moment, the technology to do a head transplant theoretically exists, but the real problems surround the connection of the spinal cord to the brain.   Quadriplegia is the likely outcome.

It is frightening to think of the extended lifespans of the 1% once the little issues regarding spinal cord connection are worked out.

 someone needs to contact the person in the photo, she may have some sort of 'intellectual' (ahrmm) property suit.  




 I have a dreadful fear that this look will become a trend for spring or something. 




 see that was where my brain was heading, increased entropy   all that ,but all this surface tension talk has me ..idk, interested. 




 oh thank you for starting my morning off with a good laugh!  Sorry about the girl, hope the next one hugs you in the religion's non-approved fashion :) 




 Yea I've seen similar situations where one among a group of irl friends  suddenly dies. It seems to sometimes spur others on to make improvements in their own world (I am thinking specifically of one young man that died of an overdose; not long after at least one of his good friends went sober, so yay to that). 
The online friends thing is slightly more difficult I thing in terms of mourning, although things like this happen: http://puu.sh/btytv.jpg  They are planting flowers in memory of a friend.

 arg ok I am replying to a bot.. I did say the original dates from 1938 but this was released in '42.

I added the 'short description' as a commement as it isn't all that short.

Help please, oh bot of wonder?? pretty please? 




 Hi sorry if I have submitted wrong (hope not!)  

The original film dates from 1938, this version was released in 1942.

Film plot courtesy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Br...
Miss Carol (Diana Durrell) is an idealistic teacher in a remote one-room schoolhouse. A native of the Ozarks herself, she is determined to stop the practice of child marriage, in which older men marry teen or preteen girls. Her campaign raises the ire of some local men, led by Jake Bolby, who drag her into the woods one night with the intention of tarring and feathering her. Before they can do this, however, Angelo the dwarf and Mr. Colton arrive with a shotgun to save the day.

Following this, Jake Bolby comes across young Jennie Colton swimming naked. When her father dies, Bolby decides to take advantage of the opportunity to blackmail her mother into letting him marry the girl, threatening that otherwise he will see her hanged for murder. After he "courts" Jennie by giving her a doll, the two are married. It later turns out that this ceremony was illegal, as child marriage had been banned several days prior, but this point quickly becomes moot. Before Bolby can consummate the union, he is gunned down by Angelo. Jennie leaves his house with Freddie, and the movie ends. 









 we may need a new sub, something like trashy home decor maybe.

I really had doubts on the posting, and I thank you for your help in modding this wonderful sub.

cheers! 




 I have lost a couple of friends that I played with on a mmorpg.  It felt similar to losing rl friends:( 

I met the mother of a player ( I did not know that young man, but recognized his name when she used it as her email), and I felt such an immediate connection to her   to her loss, I think more so than had I not realized he was a player on that game. 

Internet mourning is a real thing.

Thank you for the reply, I was rather curious as to the question myself:)
 




 curious as to why you are asking. 




 I think that the sort of 'magical thinking' of childhood extends a bit longer than most seem to believe.  
 
 That there is some sort of argument within the minds of semi-grown children as to whether "I wished my friend would die because I was mad, and she did, so it must be my fault' vs. " No that can't be correct, I didn't really want her to die   didn't hit her with that car". 

Just seems the magical thinking continuing must have some sort of contributing factors, be those drugs, isolation, wacko parents, idk.

ok just speculating here, pardon me. 




 Was there a note or something that indicated why he choose this route? He really seems like an amazing kid. 




 I don't even know where else to put this, yes it is a bit long(60min) but includes every manner of morbid crazyness including tarring   feathering, alcoholic man beating wife, child marraige , etc. 

It is billed as an educational documentary, but more like a social guidance film perhaps. 









 Why would  Gd even need to have an assigned sex?

 'Glad They Cleared Up That Mistake
February 15, 2015 by Hemant Mehta 

Boyd W. Thomas wrote a letter to the editor of the Lexington Dispatch (North Carolina) thats just gloriously weird. It begins like this:
God states that seven kings must come before the rise of the Antichrist. Revelations 17:10 says the seventh king will reign for a short amount of time. Is Barack Obama the seventh king?
I guess when the article ran, though, the headline said something like Is Obama the Antichrist? Which caused the editors to have to correct their mistake in an even more memorable way:
 *[here they duplicate the Correction as printed in the Dispatch, it made me chuckle]
So the headline is now accurate on the website. Even though the letter itself, which is the real problem, will never see a correction.
Because Murica.'

 arg ok I am adding this from wiki: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Bell#Life_after_prison
Conviction[edit]
On 17 December 1968, at Newcastle Assizes, Norma Bell was acquitted but Mary Bell was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, the jury taking their lead from her diagnosis by court-appointed psychiatrists who described her as displaying "classic symptoms of psychopathy". The judge, Mr. Justice Cusack, described her as dangerous and said she posed a "very grave risk to other children". She was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure, effectively an indefinite sentence of imprisonment. She was initially sent to Red Bank secure unit in St. Helens, Lancashire  the same facility that would house Jon Venables, one of James Bulger's child killers, 25 years later.[1]

After her conviction, Bell was the focus of a great deal of attention from the British press and also from the German Stern magazine. Her mother repeatedly sold stories about her to the press and often gave reporters writings she claimed to be by her daughter. Bell herself made headlines when, in September 1977, she briefly absconded from Moor Court open prison, where she had been held since her transfer from a young offenders institution to an adult prison a year earlier. Her penalty for this was a loss of prison privileges for 28 days.[6]

For a time, Bell also lived in a girls' remand home at Cumberlow Lodge in South Norwood (in a house built by Victorian inventor William Stanley).[7][8]

Life after prison[edit]
In 1980, Bell, aged 23, was released from Askham Grange open prison, having served 12 years, and was granted anonymity (including a new name) allowing her to start a new life. Four years later she had a daughter, born on 25 May 1984; Bell's daughter did not know of her mother's past until Bell's location was discovered by reporters in 1998 and she and her mother had to leave their house with bed sheets over their heads.

Bell's daughter's anonymity was originally protected only until she reached the age of 18. However, on 21 May 2003, Bell won a High Court battle to have her own anonymity and that of her daughter extended for life. Any court order permanently protecting the identity of a convict in Britain is consequently sometimes known as a "Mary Bell order."

In 2009, it was reported that Bell had become a grandmother 




 hmm. I tend to want to err on the side of the child.  I know there seem to be some that are born lacking the capacity to be empathetic.

I still hope that as a society we will take measures to ascertain the possible source of such horrifying behavior, and to remedy whatever may have been behind the fury   lack of control.

re the Mary Bell  case: http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1968/dec/18/ukcrime.childprotection
  "Dr Westbury's inquiries indicated that the matter was the responsibility of the health department of the Ministry of Social Security said the judge. But the department "require time to consider what they are to do and no specific time is indicated."

He continued: "It is an appalling thing that with a child as young as this one, one has to take into consideration such matters. I am not entirely unsympathetic but anxious as I am to do everything for her benefit, my primary duty is to protect other people.

"There is a very grave risk to other children if she is not closely watched and every conceivable step taken to see that she doesn't do again what she has been found guilty of. In the case of a child of this age, no question of imprisonment arises. I have power to order a sentence of detention and it seems to me that no other method of dealing with her in the circumstances is suitable."

Life detention, he said, did not mean that the person concerned was kept in custody indefinitely or for the rest of their natural lives. The position could be considered form time to time."


Adding this, just started watching but it seems ok: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFhGzE_xRI  The Mary Bell Case 




 I once worked in a children's home/hospital. We had a young girl that was HIV positive (this was back in the mid '80's).

Everyone was very happy for her when she made her first communion (yes it was a Catholic place.). Someone bought her a pin to commemorate the occasion, and while pinning it on the girl inadvertently poked her skin.

This resulted in an infection which overcame her,   she died soon thereafter.  =(   true story.

Also the use of intoxicants, even just alcohol, may lead one to the belief that the long, soulful eyes thing is communication.

I once had a long and interesting ..conversation ..with some guy I met in Paris waiting for a train to Spain. I spoke no Spanish that week, he spoke no English. We managed to converse so well we actually argued as he thought that my asking where he was from was a racist question. Lol I know this sounds bizarre, but somehow we communicated.

  (Reuters) - Russia is ready to hold talks on a new agreement to control conventional arms in Europe, a Russian Foreign Ministry official said on Wednesday, after Russia announced the end of its participation in the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.

"We are ready to look at the possibility and carry out corresponding talks on a new agreement which would adequately address new realities... and take into account the interests of the Russian Federation," Mikhail Ulyanov, director of the ministry's department on arms control, told the Interfax news agency.

While I tend to believe most reading this particular thread have the sense to not simply run to the doctor   demand a prescription based on what an anonymous voice on the internet has told them, I thought it warranted mention that not every drug is compatible with every person's situation.

 What /u/jewelsteel said makes sense. 

I want to add though that I withdraw from people when things in my life get tough. It's just what I do. This could be loss of job, financial difficulties, almost anything particularly worrisome. 

I'm fairly pedestrian, so I'm betting there are plenty of others that do the same.

 "According to the WHO classification of 1995 [10] used in this study designed in November 2008, FGM/C can be divided into four types:

Type I: Excision of the prepuce and part or all of the clitoris.

Type II: Excision of the prepuce and clitoris together with partial or total excision of the labia minora.

Type III: Infibulation. Excision of part or all of the external genitalia and stitching together of the two cut sides, to varying degrees.

Type IV: Pricking, piercing, incision, stretching, scraping, or other procedures harming the clitoris or labia, or both.

Types I, II and III of FGM/C present severe health consequences that have been well documented by several authors. The immediate health complications include shock, haemorrhage, infections and psychological consequences [11-13]. The long term health risks consist of chronic pain, infections, cheloids formation, primary infertility, birth complications, danger to the new born and psychological consequences [13-18]. Even FGM/C types I and II, sometimes considered as more innocuous, may involve severe health complications. For example, they have been reported to provoke unequivocal complications like shock, haemorrhage, urogenital complications [12], obstetric complications [18] and sexual dysfunction [15].

Despite the documented adverse effects of FGM/C, a recent review article states that its overall prevalence has declined very little [19]."

 This paper seem to place the possible origin outside of china (http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Black-Death.pdf)

"Infection and migration
Spread of the black death in Europe. 
 The plague disease, generally thought to be caused by Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda.[15] 
 
Nestorian graves dating to 1338-9 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgizstan have inscriptions
referring to plague and recent investigations by the Russian archeologist Chwolson show a high incidence rate and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which they could easily have spread to China and India.[16] 

In October 2010, medical geneticists confirmed that the plague came from China.[4] In China, the 13th century Mongol conquest disrupted farming and trading, and led to widespread famine starting in 1331 with plague arriving soon after. The population dropped from approximately 120 to 60 million.[17] The 14th-century plague killed an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians during the 15 years before it entered Constantinople in 1347.[18]

The disease may have traveled along the Silk Road with Mongol armies and traders or it could have come via ship.[19] By the end of 1346 reports of plague had reached the seaports of Europe: "India was depopulated, Tartary, Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia were covered with dead bodies".[20]

Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe at the trading city of Caffa in the Crimea in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under Jani Beg was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants. 

The Genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe, whence it spread north.[21] Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death."

 While I agree that this does seem a hoax post, I think your presumption that a 70 yo will be unable to understand what trees is after 1 day on reddit is mistaken.

I am not quite 70 (yet) but got off the defaults on ..think it was the 2nd day on site. I stumbled on trees (which I am not subbed to) in some roundabout way ( I do sub to /r/marijuanaenthusiasts though so maybe I was looking up an actual tree? lol idk).

70 years olds   those near/aapprox that age are often active on many sites, so the lingo thing is moot. I know a few personally.

Ageism is so unattractive. 




 "One girl said: "I turned up at the police station at 2/3am, blood all over me, soaked through my trousers to the crotch. They dismissed it as me being naughty, a nuisance."

Another told the authorities: "The Asian men felt they ran Oxford. That was exciting. People were afraid of them. I felt protected. People respected them."

Fear is not respect. Subjugating young girls may be the theory that these geniuses have developed to aid the acceptance of certain facets of a culture; these facets have no place in western societies.

 Remember when you were a child, and were told   thus believed that 'you can be anything you want to be, if you are willing to do the work' ?

Well lots of folk are 1. Not told that.  2.Not getting the education required to move on to a position of hope; neither at home nor through public education. 3. Do not innately possess, nor have it nurtured in them, the inner fire required to succeed against all odds. 

I can go on   on.  Truth is we can (almost) all survive in the wild were we not to cave in to despair, and were we to think.  Would help if one's parent(s) took one out for a walk in nature now   then, or had the sanity to think of their child(ren) as just that and not a buddy nor an albatross, and spent a lil time actually teaching them the silly things their parents taught them, and the ones before as well.  Oh gee I seem to be going on   on despite myself.

-- A resilience master plan that provides a framework to address and expand on the institutional, adaptation, preparedness, and recovery strategies;

--An adaptation master plan that describes specific projects and initiatives for the city to undertake that increase the city's resilience with particular attention paid to shoreline protective measures, new buildings and flood proofing for facilities;

-- Design standards that ensure building designs allow for floodplain management compliance and also maintain the desired streetscape environment;

-- A capital improvement plan that describes projects, budget, and funding sources for capital investments that improve resiliency.

-- An urban environmental design plan that describes strategies that mitigate storm impacts, including stormwater management techniques;

-- Amendments to the zoning and building code that require approaches to rehabilitation and new construction that are more resilient, but still maintain the character of existing neighborhoods.

 Conclusions

Based on the available data, and using internationally accepted methods to assess the
evidence with the most appropriate analytical techniques, WHO concludes:

1. Caesarean sections are effective in saving maternal and infant lives, but only when
they are required for medically indicated reasons.

2. At population level, caesarean section rates higher than 10% are not associated with
reductions in maternal and newborn mortality rates.

3. Caesarean sections can cause significant and sometimes permanent complications,
disability or death particularly in settings that lack the facilities and/or capacity to
properly conduct safe surgery and treat surgical complications. Caesarean sections
should ideally only be undertaken when medically necessary.

4. Every effort should be made to provide caesarean sections to women in need, rather
than striving to achieve a specific rate.

5. The effects of caesarean section rates on other outcomes, such as maternal and
perinatal morbidity, paediatric outcomes, and psychological or social well-being
are still unclear. More research is needed to understand the health effects of
caesarean section on immediate and future outcomes. "

WHO proposes the Robson classification system as a global standard for assessing,
monitoring and comparing caesarean section rates within healthcare facilities over time, and
between facilities. In order to assist healthcare facilities in adopting the Robson classification,
WHO will develop guidelines for its use, implementation and interpretation, including
standardization of terms and definitions.

Very weird. Does this island attract future serial killers?

oh jeez worse. "From August 1838 ten Aboriginal prisoners were sent to Rottnest Island (known as Wadjemup to the Noongar, possibly meaning "place across the water"[8]). After a short period when both settlers and prisoners occupied the island, the Colonial Secretary announced in June 1839 that the island would become a penal establishment for Aboriginal people and, between 1838 and 1931, Rottnest Island was used as a prison to transfer Aboriginal prisoners "overseas".
"It has been estimated that there may be as many as 369 Aboriginal graves on the island, of which five were for prisoners who were hanged."

 Wow,  I am so thrilled that I just read "The father was not charged with any crime.

Chitwood said the man was just "acting like a dad", and he didnt see anything to charge him with.

Asked whether he had any issues with the fathers actions, Chitwood said: "Not as a police chief and not as a father."

Police Chief Chitwood is the type of person I would happily elect to higher office.  

..and Go Dad!! for acting like a father and still having the sense to not carry it so far as to endanger himself with a jail term.

 Climate Change, Water, and Risk Current Water Demands Are Not Sustainable

Climate change will have a significant impact on the sustainability of water supplies in the coming decades. A new analysis, performed by consulting firm Tetra Tech for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), examined the effects of global warming on water supply and demand in the contiguous United States. The study found that more than 1,100 counties -- one-third of all counties in the lower 48 -- will face higher risks of water shortages by mid-century as the result of global warming. More than 400 of these counties will face extremely high risks of water shortages

He shot his brother Trevor Pimentel, 16, in the leg before killing himself

Kevin and Trevor had been cooking about 6pm when an argument erupted

Their mother, Helen Campochiaro, 38, was working one of her two jobs 

Relatives say she was a single mom who kept a gun for protection and that the boys had been brought up with gun safety

On a Go Fund Me page set up one day before the shooting, Campochiaro asked for help in raising a deposit for a new home"

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3014264/Sheriff-describes-horrific-scene-brothers-shot.html



 




 why do you say that "(16 year old probably lied)" ?? 




 why do they have enough bullets for this to have occurred, yet apparently not enough food for the 3 boys?  Or were they arguing about what type of rice is the best?

Idk, this is very sad. 

The mother and another brother (age 18) were not at home. I hope the 16yo will recover well, and go on to lead a wonderful life; the mom   elder brother as well.   http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/food-argument-leaves-2-brothers-dead-1-wounded/70467588/

Edit to add that I really! hope that the gun did not belong to any of the children. IDC, if this was the parent(s) loaded gun that did this, let them suffer. I just really hope it was neither the 18 nor 16 year old's. 




 crap, you mean I need to look again and not back out after the annoying captions? crap. taking a deep breath...cul

 "Thank's for uploading the amateur film, filmed by the American tourist Benjamin Gasul during his visit to Europe in spring 1939. Benjamin Gasul visited Warsaw in early May 1939, and filmed in one of the streets in the old Jewish quarter in Warsaw, about four  months before the German attack on Poland on September 1, 1939.
Benjamin Gasul was born into a Jewish family in Riga in 1898, and emmigrated to USA. in 1910's."

 "Dear Madame Lori Bernstein it`s very said and highly unjust what You say,
that movie was obviously produced before German Nazis conquered Poland.
Date of movie: May of 1939
Date of German nazi invasion on Poland: September of 1939
In the moment which is presented in movie there were NO ghetto in Warsaw.
I would appreciate if You look on Warsaw Ghetto history at YadVashem Institute website: http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/03/warsaw.asp

In that time (presented at movie) Polish Jews were living in all sites of our tolerant community. Jewish and Polish people where living, studying and making businesses together.
And Polish people are the biggest worldwide group helping Jews in World War II, look again at website of YadVashem...:
http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/statistics.asp

In our country (only in Poland and Yugoslavia in occupied Europe) helping Jews was endangered by inmediate death penalty to all members of family helping Jews (by giving shelter food or whatever). That execution was realised by German Nazi soldiers in home where they found such a family.

 If it was a benefit of her employment, she likely wasn't paying for it, or was doing so at a discounted rate.  Perhaps they capped the coverage. 




 She was working in the field. Supposedly it was part of her employees benefit package. 




 I can't come to a conclusion one way or the other. 

She was born in Germany, but attended high school in USA   was working in job in which I think she would have needed good language skills.

 low sodium concentration in blood = hyponatremia.  It is relative. 




 the condition is not about fluids, but about sodium concentration.

so either too little sodium or too much water in the blood, basically.

 No. It just takes effort here. 

I have a bad habit of ...say eating a tomato, and being all like 'gee that was yummy!', and thus saving some seeds.

I have become more conscious of where the fruits   vegetables I eat come from of late. 

Also just research your seed sources. Do a simple  search of say 'non gmo seeds' or 'organic seeds', and read! the results. They twist language a lot on the advert sites,in case u hadn't noticed:)

I need to link this simply on the grounds that I searched as I recommended above, and I have some sort of combined ' No! this is bs! attitude combined with  a 'gee, that sounds so sweet:)' attitude.

 "State attorney general
  
The state attorney general in each of the 50 U.S. states and territories is the chief legal advisor to the state government and the state's chief law enforcement officer. In some states, the attorney general serves as the head of a state department of justice, with responsibilities similar to those of the United States Department of Justice."  

from wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general

So yes, the state attorney general is a power office. 




 I think maybe she is a young woman allowed little freedom. 

Perhaps she has been schooled at home, not often going outside, and perhaps had the sun moon/day night explained to her as "the sun circles the earth, then the moon comes out. Like when I spin this coin, the sides facing us change."

Or so I would like to believe:)

 It did send me off of a wiki journey where I have learned something about steatopygia, elongated labia, Saartjie Baartman, and the Khoikhoi people.  

All morbidly interesting, though I may need a drink now.
 




 Holy smokes.  A 5 year old found the baby. To me this the worst part, as horrible as it all is. 
 
"the baby's body was found on the kitchen counter by a 5-year-old relative who was dropped off to wait for his bus to school. 

The knife used on the baby was found placed in the dead baby's hand, Deters said." 




 I like 'OK'.  No one really knows... this is an interesting obituary, of the etymologist who, "FOR much of his long career studying language Allen Read sought the origin of OK"
    "Mr Read showed how, stage by stage, OK was spread throughout North America and the world to the moon, and then took on its new form AOK, first used by space people and frowned on by purists. This being an exercise in the academic world, there remain some doubters. Some believe that the Boston newspaper's reference to OK may not be the earliest. Some are attracted to the claim that it is of American-Indian origin. There is an Indian word, okeh, used as an affirmative reply to a question. Mr Read treated such doubting calmly. Nothing is absolute, he once wrote,nothing is forever.

 My high history teacher told us it was a password for the underground railroad. 




 I guess people that do these sort of bizarre things are geniuses? 
No idea. 




  If it was a white or Asian teacher referring to a black student with the 'n' word every time she called on him in class,  would you be satisfied with a 5 day suspension???

Editing to add I am happy that the kid was unfamiliar with these slurs. Thankfully he had not experienced that particular reference (raghead taliban) prior to encountering this genius of a 'teacher'. 

First encounters with blatant racism can be pretty traumatic. I will be surprised if the parents don't file a suit in civil court for damages. 




 I find the story sad actually. her husband dies before the baby is born,  then So as to protect myself from men and the harshness of their looks and being targeted by them due to traditions, I decided to be a man  and dressed in their clothes and worked alongside them in other villages where no one knows me.  The daughter marries, husband  has something happen which leaves him unable to work, so grandma is continuing to work to support them all   the grand kids.  




 look at the actual article. It isn't this simple. 




 no that's some quality 5 head..maybe a 6. 




 souls for sale?? 




 I must have missed that in my outrage, it's too soon for me to look again though. Hope whatever your dad is doing helps and does no harm. 




 yes! and shore up Alaska.

 "The quake occurred at a depth of less than two miles, which is considered shallow, and potentially more damaging than quakes emanating from deeper down.

The USGS previously rated the temblor at 7.5 magnitude but later upgraded the strength. The USGS reported aftershocks at strengths of 6.6 and 5.1." 














 "Comcast and Time Warner Cables decision to end Comcasts proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable is in the best interests of consumers," Wheeler said. "The proposed transaction would have created a company with the most broadband and the video subscribers in the nation alongside the ownership of significant programming interests."

He added: "Today, an online video market is emerging that offers new business models and greater consumer choice. The proposed merger would have posed an unacceptable risk to competition and innovation, including to the ability of online video providers to reach and serve consumers."

And he said: "I am especially proud of our close working relationship throughout the review process with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Our collaboration provided both agencies with a deeper understanding of the important issues of innovation and competition that the proposed transaction raised.

 "A farm east of Hawley, Minnesota is preparing for the worst after initial tests come back presumably positive for avian flu.

As Valley News Live first reported Tuesday, more than 300,000 may have to be destroyed if the test is confirmed positive. Amon Baer says the birds are all contained and there are no eggs on store shelves."

Different source:
"It may be too late for the Red River Valley to contain the avian flu. Valley News Live has learned a farm just southeast of Hawley, Minnesota may have to destroy hundreds of thousands of chickens after initial test results come back positive for avian flu. We first met Amon Baer nearly two years ago when summer's heat took a toll on his chickens. Now, he'd rather take the heat over what he's looking at, a presumed positive test for avian flu. "We've been very vigilant in trying to monitor the birds and watch them for any signs of disease," Baer said. Baer said he works with around 300,000 chickens on his farm every day. He noticed Monday something wasn't right with about 30 of them. "I know what a healthy bird looks like and these looked a little sick, under the weather, breathing difficulty, a little foaming from the mouth," Baer said. What Baer doesn't know is how some of his birds came down with the virus, though wild waterfowl are known for carrying it. "We don't have wild geese or ducks in the barn. I don't know how it would have transferred from the waterfowl into the building," Baer said. Now the building will have to be emptied. All 300,000 chickens will likely be wiped out completely once the final test comes back. A livelihood put on hold. "It's very deflating. I've been in the business for 50 years and we've never had a disease outbreak on the farm to speak of that amounted to anything," Baer said. A hit to the Baer Brothers Farm that was luckily caught early. "They have a 48 hour period. None of the eggs that would have been quarantined here have gotten into any customers hands," Baer said. The USDA and APHIS will be out on the farm Wednesday to work out a plan to compost all of the birds. Baer said a final test result is expected then as well.

 "...Oklahomas government on Tuesday embraced a scientific consensus that earthquakes rocking the state are largely caused by the underground disposal of billions of barrels of wastewater from oil and gas wells."

"In past decades, Oklahomans experienced only about one and a half earthquakes exceeding magnitude 3.0 in an average year. But since a boom in oil and gas exploration began in the mid-2000s, that number has mushroomed. The state recorded 585 quakes of 3.0 or greater last year, more than any state except Alaska, and is on course to register more than 900 such tremors this year."

"Larger quakes have also occurred. A series of shocks in 2011 exceeding magnitude 5.0 caused millions of dollars in damage. Some seismologists have warned that the state is risking larger and more damaging quakes unless it acts to reduce the number of tremors."

 Theres also the question of private property on both sides of the equation  private mineral rights and private homes, says the mayor. And its a public safety issue. It does raise questions about long-term infrastructure cost. It is something weve got to consider. I am a big proponent of natural gas and what it could do for energy independence in this country. The question of how and where we should be doing it is what we need science to help us figure out. Its good city policy if we know what the safest way to extract it is."

  Before the occurrence of probable injection-induced earthquakes in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in 2008, the historic seismicity record includes only one felt earthquake within the 140,000km2 Fort Worth Basin.  The recent increase in US seismicity is not a natural phenomenon but is instead caused by human practices, primarily wastewater injection.

 Yes, I agree it is not normal.  ( and yes I can understand and picture 
the possibility of a "stalled low pressure system that creates a 'loop' in the Jet Stream.").

My real question of course is 'Why?'.

The physical causes are very nicely explained in your link, tyvm! I suppose that means my real question is 'How' did this happen?  No!, I do not please! wish to hear a long winded explanation of climate warming from the start of time, tyvm:)

I am rather more curious as to how any of the stagnant factors came to exist.  Exactly:)

Stuff flows from a higher concentration to a lower usually, so if the methane is retaining heat why would the blob move?

 If the methane is the result of underground shifts, well then they may all be tied up in one scary package, no?

 




 no the part about 11 years x months is the minimum time he has left to serve, "Kurti was given a minimum tariff of 12 years, but will have to serve another 11 years and four months before he can be considered for parole due to time spent in custody awaiting trial."

u/marmz1 said something about the frequencies used by the RC folk requiring line-of-sight.

So that has me wondering if using these lower frequencies coupled with digital spectrum modulation wouldn't overcome that objection.

I'm thinking it's a cost thing, but honestly I don't know enough to know.

If you get a moment, would you please ELI5 why this wouldn't resolve the issue of tripping over the astronomers wavelengths? 

Thanks! 




 I'm trying to overcome the objections to using a different frequency, such as those made above by u/marmz1

 A way this robot can run without interference with the astronomers wavelengths.  I get a little tenacious sometimes. 




 would using DSM (Digital Spectrum Modulation) technology make any sense or is it too expensive ?
 




 thanks! 




 thank you. one more :)
  
 The article says "The NRAO isn't happy. The iRobot lawnmowers would be using a frequency range they say is reserved for their telescopes -- 6240 to 6740 MHz." 

The common walkie talkies people use, use 462 and 467 MHz in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band. according to the Family Radio Service wiki. These wouldn't require a sight line, no?   




 why would it be problematic for these robots to run using the walkie-talkie frequencies?

Shouldn't be that difficult to set up individual, buyer-set programs using these, no?  I'm just guessing here.

'An earlier version of the plan had been opposed by Mr. Creaghs senior staff. The staff endorsed an amended plan earlier this month after royalty rates to the state nearly doubled.

 Man, I was trying to find the milk question..can't link it but The Telegraph reads like this:

British-born farmer quizzes Vladimir Putin on price of milk in live phone-in
John Kopiski engages Russian president in conversation about milk production during Mr Putin's annual marathon phone-in


A farmer born in Britain called John was one of the first Russian citizens to quiz Vladimir Putin during his annual marathon phone-in.

Sporting a Tolstoyan white beard and speaking in heavily accented Russian, John Kopiski engaged the president in a conversation about milk production.
Mr Kopiski, a father of five with a Russian wife who has been a Russian citizen since 1997, told Mr Putin that he had 1,700 head of cattle producing 10,000 litres of milk each a year, but that he couldn't make enough money because of low prices for his product.

The farmer, who lives in the Vladimir region near Moscow, suggested to Mr Putin that his aides might be fearful of telling him about the real state of the economy.
"You have the statistics and according to them everything is good," said Mr Kopiski, after Mr Putin had reeled off figures suggesting an economic upturn. "Do you believe in the statistics that you are shown? Or do are you lied to, because they're afraid to tell you the truth, or is something else not right with these statistics?"

Mr Putin appeared amused and inquired how Mr Kapiski had come to be in Russia, asking if was "Cherchez la femme? Looking for a wife?"
The president then said that he trusted the statistics provided to him and he was aware of farmers' problems.
"And of course we will raise state support," he said. "I think the government will have to do that."

With his distinctive looks and unusual background, John Kopiski admits he has become something of a celebrity in the small world of Russian milk producers.

So when a member of the countrys dairy producers' union asked him to speak up on the troubled industrys behalf, he agreed - provided, he said, that he was allowed to tell Putin the truth.
I got an invitation out of the blue, and at first I wasnt sure about it. Then I was told I could ask whatever I wanted so I said yes. I wrote the question myself and I didnt have to show it to them in advance, he told the Telegraph after the event.

Mr Kopiski, a former London coal and steel trader, moved to Russia in 1992 after falling in love with the country on a business trip. He subsequently married, converted to Russian Orthodoxy, and took citizenship in 1997.
Since 2004 he and his Russian wife, Nina, have invested millions in developing the Rozhdestvo dairy farm in the Vladimir region.

The farm has been hailed as a showpiece success in a sector still dominated by out-dated, Soviet-era practices. But despite massive success, Mr Kopiski has yet to recoup a single kopeck of his investment.
The father of five said it would take at least four more years to pay off $3 million in loans, and his son has told him it would be mad for him to take on the family business when Mr Kopiski retires.

Dairy farmers across Russia are blighted, he says, by a lack of long-term credit, a dysfunctional subsidies system, and the reluctance of officials to admit that the official statistics they have been relying on for years are grossly over-optimistic.

The main point is, how long are we expected to carry on working for nothing? Thats what I feel I have been doing for 11 years now. If you found me a buyer who would take if off me for the money Ive put into it, Id sell like a shot. Its sad, but there it is, he said.

But Mr Kopiski says the experience has not dented his affection for his adopted country or his respect for Mr Putin, who he says is the only option for Russia at the current time.
If his accountants are putting dodgy figures in front of him, how is he meant to know what is going on? People have been congratulating me for asking a tough question. Well, if I was encouraged to ask a question like that, I hope it means it will provoke him to have a good look at the issue.

In the meantime, he says, he tries to remain upbeat.
As an Orthodox guy, one of the biggest sins is impatience, he said. Im 66 this year. You have some perspective at that age."

In an interview with Radio Free Europe last month, Mr Kopiski said: "I'm Russian, I'm at home here. If tomorrow we need to go to the front, to face Nato, I'll be the first to go."

 Final Summary, from different source,(Radio Free Europe, http://www.rferl.org/contentlive/putin-live-russians-q-and-a-liveblog/26959840.html)

"-- In his annual question-and-answer session with the public, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Western sanctions are aimed at restraining Russia, asserting that Moscow's role in the crisis and conflict in Ukraine are only a pretext for the punitive measures imposed by the European Union, United States, and other nations.

-- He said that "the Russian army is not in Ukraine," repeating Moscow's denial that it has sent troops to aid pro-Russian rebels.

-- Putin highlighted the recent rise of Russia's ruble currency, which has gained more than 20 percent in 2015 after a steep decline last year. He also touted high oil production figures and a good harvest. He said Russians are living longer and death rates decreasing.

-- Putin linked his decision to lift a ban on supplying Iran with surface-to-air S-300 missiles with what he said was Tehran's demonstrated desire to resolve a yearslong dispute over its nuclear program, which Western nations fear is aimed at developing nuclear weapons.

-- Putin took on comparisons that suggest parallels between the reigns of Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin, saying that "Nazism and Stalinism cannot be put on the same desk...because the Nazis directly, openly, and publicly announced as one of their goals the annihilation of concrete ethnic groups -- Jews, Gypsies, Slavs."

-- He described the killing of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov as "tragic and shameful" and praised investigators for identifying and arresting five suspects days after Nemstov was gunned down steps from the Kremlin on February 27.

-- Putin said his country will never be a "vassal" of the United States. He said there are "superpowers" that "consider themselves the only center of power in the world."

 "...Four days later, the dog's owner entered the hospital with a fever and a bloody cough that became worse over the next few hours, but an initial blood culture was misidentified, according to the CDC report.

As the patient's symptoms grew worse, the test was redone and he was found to have been infected with pnumonic plague, according to the CDC report. The remains of the dog were also tested and were found to be positive for the plague bacteria.

"Frankly one of the biggest surprises of this outbreak is the source," said John Douglas, of Tri-County Health Department in Colorado and one of the study authors. "Primarily ... dogs dont get sick at all or they get a minor illness," after being infected with the plague.

Janine Runfola, of the Tri-County Health Department in Colorado and lead author of the report, explained that cats are more likely to infect humans with the disease than dogs because they exhibit more symptoms.

"For pneumonic plague a more likely scenario would be you have a cat [play] with prairie dogs and infected fleas get on the cat," Runfola said. "The cat gets sick and sneezes and coughs on its owner."

"The plague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, and can infect the body in different ways. For example a flea bite can lead to infection of the glands, which is called bubonic plague -- notorious for the epidemics it spawned during the Middle Ages in Europe. Because this plague was spread from dog to owner through coughing, it developed into pneumonic plague, according to Douglas.

The plague is known to be endemic to prairie dogs in the American Southwest, which can then lead to isolated outbreaks of the disease in domestic animals or humans. 









 WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - U.S. telecom industry groups, alongside AT T Inc and smaller companies, on Friday called for regulators to immediately block parts of new stricter rules for Internet service providers, citing steep costs and threats to investment.

In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, USTelecom Association, CTIA-The Wireless Association and CenturyLink Inc sought to block the agency's move to reclassify broadband Internet as a more heavily regulated telecommunications service and a new broad general conduct standard.

The groups and companies, which are challenging the rules in court, did not ask to pause implementation of the brightline rules that ban companies from blocking or slowing down web traffic or striking deals with content companies for smoother downloads.

The filing cites several testimonials of executives at regional and local Internet providers that the rules, slated to go into effect in June, will create costly compliance burdens and limit resources for improvements to broadband networks or new products.

 yea I'm not entirely certain what exactly I think of his theory; but I certainly find it somewhat plausible, and rather interesting, so I thought I would put it out here:) 




 I also saw so many positive moments; I simply will never agree that destruction of one's home city/town/village/etc by those that reside there can ever do anything that will positively make for change.

This case, the horrible damage done to Freddie Gray, while in police custody which resulted in his far too early demise..this is a case that no one can possibly argue was justifiable.

My sympathy and love goes out to those family and friends of this young man; my anger   fury goes out to those that think destruction and violence will in any way help get the now so obvious   undeniable point across that unjustified violence against black youth exists   needs to be taken seriously into account by law enforcement agencies.

Peaceful protest, particularly in this instance, is IMHO the means to a more positive end result.

 




 (A megalith is a large stone that has been used to construct a structure or monument, either alone or together with other stones. The word "megalithic" describes structures made of such large stones, utilizing an interlocking system without the use of mortar or concrete, as well as representing periods of prehistory characterised by such constructions. For later periods the term monolith, with an overlapping meaning, is more likely to be used.)

 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY Meaning of the Monolith Revealed PART 2 (2014 update) 
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpWMnlMIWAU 









 Cleopatra's Needle is the popular name for each of three Ancient Egyptian obelisks re-erected in London, Paris, and New York City during the nineteenth century. The obelisks in London and New York are a pair, and the one in Paris is also part of a pair originally from a different site in Luxor, where its twin remains. Although all three needles are genuine Ancient Egyptian obelisks, their shared nickname is a misnomer, as they have no connection with Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt, and were already over a thousand years old in her lifetime. The London and New York "needles" were originally made during the reign of the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Thutmose III. The Paris "needle" dates to the reign of 19th Dynasty Ramesses II and was the first to be moved and re-erected as well as the first to acquire the nickname, "L'aiguille de Cloptre" in French.

 US military 'monitoring' Iran ship seizure
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32503660
 




 (Reuters) - Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television said an Iranian "force" seized a U.S. cargo ship after opening fire on it in the Gulf on Tuesday and directed it to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas.

A Pentagon spokesman said Iranian forces had boarded a Marshall Island-flagged vessel, the MV Maersk Tigris, in the Gulf. He said the boarding occurred after Iranian patrol boats fired shots across the vessel's bow and ordered it deeper into Iranian waters.

The ship had no U.S. citizens aboard, the spokesman said, contradicting Al-Arabiya's report which said there were 34 U.S. sailors on board. He said it was traveling through the Strait of Hormuz when the incident occurred.

There was no immediate word from Iranian officials.

Iran has in the past sometimes threatened to block the strait to advance its opposition to sanctions imposed over its nuclear program.

The channel is a narrow strip of water separating Oman and Iran. It connects the biggest Gulf oil producers, such as Saudi Arabia, with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.

At its narrowest point, the strait is 33 km (21 miles) across and consists of 2-mile wide navigable channels for inbound and outbound shipping and a 2-mile-wide buffer zone.

 Earthquake Devastates Nepal, Killing More Than 1,900

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/world/asia/nepal-earthquake-katmandu.html?_r=0 




 Q:How long do you have to work without a bathroom break? Do you have a special bottle in your cab for toilet emergencies? Do you eat while working? Do you bring your own water or thermos of coffee/tea? Do you/can you use your cellphone while driving? Do train operators have to pass eye exams, as for an automobile drivers license? Are you allowed to listen to music while working? How long do you sit and drive the train before you get a break or chance to stretch your legs? In which city aside from New York would you like to operate a train and why? What is the usual relationship between train operator and train conductor  friends or competitors? What are the special or funny ways or phrases that train operators and conductors describe passengers? Do you have special emergency equipment since 9/11? Who has the better career: train operators or bus drivers and why?

Thank you to you and your colleagues for your service and helping make New York City great!

 Posted by Darryl Mitteldorf, LCSW

Answer:
We have what is known as recovery time at the end of the lines. In the terminals, we can use the bathroom or have our lunch break, which is built into our schedule. As long as the railroad is running on time, we have time to eat, but if the we are running behind, we may not have time to eat. Eating while operating the train is against the rules, as is the use of cellphones or audio devices such as iPods. The rules in the cab are just like the laws that prohibit you from doing certain things while driving a car.

All train operators and conductors have to pass full medical exams to operate a train.

Operating a train on the Amtrak system would be appealing to me.

We work as a team for six months at a time and have the chance to build relationships, which are usually good among operators and conductors.

There are no special or funny phrases that we say about our passengers, except take care and travel safely.

Since 9/11, we are now issued a mask, just like the ones you see police officers wearing in emergency situations.

Bus operators have the same responsibilities of moving passengers safely from one point to another, but they have the added responsibility of also performing as a conductor and a station agent on their buses. Both jobs can make good careers!

All transit workers appreciate you, too. Thank you.

 http://www.greatwar.co.uk/

by John McCrae, May 1915

'In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
That mark our place; and in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.

We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders fields.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high.
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields.'

This poem has always touched me deeply. All those men, so many so very young.I'm sorry if the poppy part doesn't work for Anzac, but the sentiment..surely there is that in common?

Edit to add that going forward I shall wear a sprig of rosemary on Anzac day; thank you for the education:)

 These are listed by NBC (US based) as places to help, in case any were missed above.

World Vision

The humanitarian aid group had staff on the ground in Nepal when the quake hit. As the organization tries to locate all of its workers, the ones who are safe are reporting that the immediate needs are food, water and shelter, spokeswoman Laura Blank told NBC News.

"It's freezing outside especially at night. I can't imagine how children and families are gonna sleep tonight," said child protection specialist Rosalyn Lorin, who witnessed the quake. "They need blankets and shelter. They're now afraid to go back (to) their houses."

Those who wish to donate to World Vision can visit their Nepal page or text NEPAL to 777444 to donate $10.

Red Cross

Emergency responders from the Red Cross have been mobilized to affected areas and are especially concerned about more remote towns that have been blocked off by landslides and lost communication.

"We are extremely concerned about the fate of communities in towns and villages in rural areas closer to the epicenter," said Jagan Chapagain, the IFRC's Director for Asia Pacific. The International Federation of Red Cross is using funds to try to get aid to those cut-off areas. The organization's blood bank in the capital of Kathmandu is also operating to provide blood supplies to medical facilities in the city.

For more information, visit the International Federation of Red Cross' website.

UNICEF

The United Nations Children's Fund already has staff in Nepal. For more information, visit UNICEF's website. People can also text "Nepal" to 864233 to donate $10.


International Medical Corps

The organization focuses on delivering medical supplies and sending teams to assist and train health care workers in crisis regions. Their team is heading to the epicenter of the quake, where they say hospitals are overflowing, and medicine and supplies are expected to be quickly depleted. To donate to their Nepal response, click here.

Save the Children

The non-governmental organization has launched disaster response on the ground in Nepal, and works specifically with children and families. Ten percent of donations also go toward preparing for the next emergency response, according to its website. To donate, visit their Nepal page.

CARE

The group has previous experience responding to landslides in Nepal, and humanitarian workers are currently in the country providing food, water, shelter and health care, according to its website. To donate, visit their NEPAL page.


GlobalGiving

The charity crowd funding site has set up a Nepal-specific page. Any donations made will support various relief and recovery efforts in Nepal. The money will first go toward immediate needs like food, fuel, clean water, hygiene products and shelter. Later, the money raised will transition to supporting vetted local organizations that are working on recovery efforts. To donate, click here.
@GlobalGiving
You can provide emergency supplies to victims in Nepal by donating to the Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund http://www.globalgiving.org/projects/nepal-earthquake-relief-fund/?rf=twtr 

FINDING THE MISSING

Here are websites to check on loved ones in the quake region:

Google Person Finder

In the search function, enter information to locate someone who is missing or found, or enter the name of someone who is missing in order to search other entries.

Restoring Family Links

The website has a list of people who have registered as alive and a list of people who have been reported missing. Affected residents can register or report here.


Facebook Safety Check

Those in the area affected by the quake will get a notification from Facebook when they log on asking them if they're safe. People can check the page to see who has checked in and let their friends know they're OK.

 I am happy you just made me giggle out loud , I needed that ! :) ty 




 My whole point was that children (as in 9,12,14,15,17 year olds even) are easily fooled into believing the invisible real person they are actually communicating with is the love of their young life. 

I really am all in favor of parental monitoring of communications made by youngsters on the assorted devices and apps, and even more strongly so of the need for parents to guide   educate their children as concerns the use of real names, real school names, real town names etc etc,

I have played mmorpg games where I hear kids telling so much rl info to absolute strangers , I get all mama bear and lecture them.  On the other hand I have spent several years speaking to people online I have met in these places, have met some irl, love them   feel closer to some then to rl friends. But I am an adult, my shit-detector works fairly well. Not so much when I was 13.

SAN JOS: Costa Rican authorities declared an emergency on Sunday after a ship carrying 180 tons of ammonium nitrate sunk off the country's Pacific coast.

The National Emergency Commission (CNE) urged people to avoid swimming at beaches and suspend fishing in the region off the port of Puntarenas, 90km west of the capital.

The CNE said the accident occurred on Saturday when the boat sank in heavy seas. Two crew members were rescued without incident, the CNE said.

Ammonium nitrate is often used in the manufacture of fertilizers and explosives, and can be dangerous to health in cases of direct contact with the chemical.  AFP 









 I just posted a sort of guide (on this sub) , mostly taken from a friend's site, entitled 
'CHECK YOUR KIDS FACEBOOKS FOR SEX OFFENDERS AMONG THEIR FRIENDS LIST'. Lol really bad title I guess. Anyway it's already being down voted but while it is still up u may want to have a gander if you have some concern re safe use of apps etc by kids/teens/etc.  




 posting this in response to questions re the father that used kik to lure kiddie pore using his own children's pics.

CHECK YOUR KIDS FACEBOOKS FOR SEX OFFENDERS AMONG THEIR FRIENDS LIST (ty Trench)

Thanks to this article from KYW Radio in Philadelphia (Come on South Jersey and Philly peeps sing along with TrenchKYWNews Radio1060) I was introduced to a Facebook app called Friend Verifier. Its an app that allows you to check your kids Facebook friends list for sex offenders.

The first thing youll need is a Friend Verifier account which is free. The second thing youll need is the login and password of the Facebook account youll be checking. Remember, youre the parent. You should already have all of your kids logins.

Log in to your childs Facebook account then go to the Friend Verifier website log in to your FV account then click on the button that says Scan all friends for sex offenders. It doesnt hurt to check your own Facebook friends list either. Thankfully mine came up empty but I can say that at least in that way it works.

However even Friend Verifier will tell you that not every search is perfect and may miss a sex offender in their scan due to whatever information is already out there.

Wile FV is a great tool no tool is perfect and once again I remind you that as a parent youre the only true defense between online predators and your kids."


and "Again I say to parents its up to you on whether or not you want to allow your kids to have Snapchat on their phones or tablets. However I urge you that if you do make frequent checks on their friends list to make sure that no adult is contacting them for sexual reasons."

From the story he wrote re the dad using kik: "Now Im not saying that Kik should be driven out of business or anything like that. Kik is just a tool but its the way that others use that too that you should be aware of in order to better protect your kids."

I'm not even going to mention the Craig's List   Backpage horrors.

http://trenchreynolds.com/ 




 way I read it is he pretty well forced his kids to pose, then used those pics to lure others.  

Anyone with kids that have cells really need to be on top on their use of sites such as kik/snapchat/etc.  




   /\_     I broke mine :(   In fact someone snuck up and grabbed the cherry wood piece dang it! 




 I think I read ..somewhere..that he has a daughter and a son, and that he used their pictures to pose as a teen, attracting other young people to respond as if they were dealing with someone of their own age.  




 wow, this is seriously awful.  I'm so sorry for the difficulties you are going through. It doesn't sound as if those that have the power to make change happen care at all.  The world really needs to wake up and see what these seemingly small and localized water lack situations are adding up to.

Start saving any rain water you might get, cover it tightly so as to help prevent mosquito borne illness. 

Reuse the water you wash with to water any garden you may have. 

Please people, stand up for those being affected by the lack of water in Puerto Rico now; we very well may be next if action isn't taken rapidly.

 




 yes. http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/watersustainability/ 




 "SPRINGFIELD TOWNSHIP, OH (WOIO) - A 35-year-old Springfield Township man was arrested after he confessed to using nude photos of his own children online. 

The man originally turned himself in to officers stating that he had only traded photos of himself with others on the social media app, Kik. Kik is an instant messaging app where you can send pics and video to any other user in seconds on any smart phone. Last year it had 120 million users, many being teenagers.

Detectives were able to later determine that the suspect also traded nude photos of his two teens. The material was traded with both juveniles and adults. 

Detectives have been in contact with the FBI to assist further in the investigation. 
The father is now charged with two felonies. He's sitting in the Summit County Jail on a $100,000 bond. He's due back in court next month.

19 Action News has decided not to identify the man to protect the identity of his kids. "

Please be on top of what your children are doing on line with these types of apps. It's the way that others use that too that you should be aware of in order to better protect your kids. 









 It's mighty scary stuff once you start reading up on it. Let's hope it will be several hundred more years before it gets the urge to move again, and that by then people will have found a way to mitigate any potential harm.

 ASTANA -- Kazakhstan has suspended poultry imports from neighboring Russian region of Astrakhan, citing an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu there.

The Kazakh Ministry of Agriculture announced on April 30 that the poultry imports had been suspended as of April 28.

Last week, Kazakh authorities temporarily banned Russia-made butter, chocolate, candies, and mayonnaise, while Russian agricultural watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor barred the import of 20 tons of wheat flour from Kazakhstan.

Earlier in April, Russian authorities suspended Kazakh dairy products imports to Russia.

Some media reports in Russia and Kazakhstan have called the situation a "trade war" between the two countries, which are close trade partners and founding members of a four-nation Eurasian Economic Union created this year on the basis of an existing customs union.

In separate statements last week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov and Kazakh Deputy Economy Minister Qaiyrbek Oskenbaev said that there is no trade war and that the bans were motivated purely by health concerns.  









 of course. I just hated hearing him mention the madrid. I generally don't follow his assorted stuff, pure serendipity that I caught it today.

 Agreed. This was the reason I snuck that little history piece in, the New Madrid is terrifying were it to reoccur. These odd quakes in Idaho/Mississippi/Michigan are getting me nervous.

"The Seattle Times reports:

"A day of peaceful May Day rallies for immigrant rights in Seattle turned chaotic Friday night as a separate anti-capitalist march descended into clashes between police and protesters on Capitol Hill.
"Three officers were injured and admitted to Harborview Medical Center. Several protesters reported injuries from pepper spray and projectiles fired by police. Sixteen people were arrested."
Member station KUOW reports: "The day began with a small Black Lives Matter gathering at Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park. Those people then joined the annual May Day March for Workers and Immigrant Rights. It began at Judkins Park in the Central District then headed downtown for a rally at the Federal Courthouse."

"According to The Associated Press: "Earlier demonstrations in Seattle and Portland, Oregon, to decry racism and income inequality were largely peaceful, but protesters who gathered later in the day confronted police, who attempted to keep them from damaging property and disrupting traffic."

at least they made note that the black lives matter portion was peacefully conducted.

baby steps I suppose. But your point is well made. I didn't see any reports of looting/fire starting either, both of which make matters so much more news-able (yep I invented that word).

 I'm assuming the dog was infected by fleas.  However:  

"...Four days later, the dog's owner entered the hospital with a fever and a bloody cough that became worse over the next few hours, but an initial blood culture was misidentified, according to the CDC report.

As the patient's symptoms grew worse, the test was redone and he was found to have been infected with pnumonic plague, according to the CDC report. The remains of the dog were also tested and were found to be positive for the plague bacteria.

"Frankly one of the biggest surprises of this outbreak is the source," said John Douglas, of Tri-County Health Department in Colorado and one of the study authors. "Primarily ... dogs dont get sick at all or they get a minor illness," after being infected with the plague.

Janine Runfola, of the Tri-County Health Department in Colorado and lead author of the report, explained that cats are more likely to infect humans with the disease than dogs because they exhibit more symptoms.
"For pneumonic plague a more likely scenario would be you have a cat [play] with prairie dogs and infected fleas get on the cat," Runfola said. "The cat gets sick and sneezes and coughs on its owner."

"The plague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, and can infect the body in different ways. For example a flea bite can lead to infection of the glands, which is called bubonic plague -- notorious for the epidemics it spawned during the Middle Ages in Europe. Because this plague was spread from dog to owner through coughing, it developed into pneumonic plague, according to Douglas.

The plague is known to be endemic to prairie dogs in the American Southwest, which can then lead to isolated outbreaks of the disease in domestic animals or humans.

From original posted article:
"The scarcity of water is not the trees only enemy amid the drought.

Weakened and dehydrated, many of the trees are being finished off by bark beetles  tiny brown insects that thrive in dry conditions, chewing away at pines and making them brittle.

Officials say they are seeing an uptick in bark beetles amid the drought. In the San Bernardino forest, bark beetle infestations were considered a factor in deadly fires that devoured swaths of mountainside in 2003.

The trees natural defense against the beetles lies in their sticky resin, said Timothy Paine, an entomologist at UC Riverside who has studied the beetles and their environment.

The water in properly hydrated trees creates pressure internally that pushes the resin out to the trees surface, deflecting beetles that dont want to get caught in it, Paine said. When a tree is dried up, it cant produce additional resin that protects it from the beetles, making a perfect opportunity for them to colonize, Paine said.

If you have a drought, you get large numbers of trees that are susceptible, Paine said. The beetles build up their populations.

Description
According to reports, underwater volcano Axial Seamount has erupted again, as a geologist in Oregon State had predicted earlier. The volcano is present 300 miles off the Oregon Coast. Before this, the volcano erupted four years ago and in 1998. The reports stated that the underwater volcano does not pose any threat to humans. But a research on the volcano could help in predicting volcanic eruptions elsewhere. Dr. Bill Chadwick, an Oregon State geologist, said the volcano eruption is a common occurrence on earth, but scientists and geologists know very little about the eruptions because oceans make it very difficult to understand what has been happening beneath the surface. In 2006, Chadwick and one of his colleagues predicted that the Axial Seamount would erupt again before 2014. Before the latest eruption, the volcano erupted in 2011. In September, 2014, they predicted that another eruption would occur in 2015 and the latest eruption has proved them right. According to the reports, researchers have planned to start an expedition this summer where they will visit the site and use submersible vehicles to observe the location where they think the eruption has taken place. Chadwick said earthquakes of low magnitude are caused by magma forcing its way up to the surface to erupt. It is the location where researchers can learn several things about these processes that are still mystery, Chadwick added. Eruption in 2011 pressure from the magma had pushed the sea floor up. While providing information about the volcano, Chadwick said, "The volcano inflates like a balloon. So there's magma being fed from below and as that balloon inflates, the seafloor rises up. It's been rising up at a rate that hasn't been seen before". Then the sea floor dropped over the course of the eruption.

 "For example, according to the Americas Water analysis, much of the West and Midwest are in a pattern of long-term, chronic deficit with regard to water useeven as some of those areas are net-exporters of high water-consuming crops. This suggests that by shifting water-intensive crop production to less water-stressed regions, overall national water stress could be substantially reduced. But in order to do so, policy makers will need a much more robust set of models that address the complex interplay of factors affecting water supply and use." 




 U.S. Provides $225 Million for Conservation in Puerto Rico

SAN JUAN  The U.S. government has appropriated move than $225 million for conservation of natural resources in Puerto Rico, the head of the islands Federal Affairs Administration said Tuesday.

 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)  California water regulators adopted sweeping, unprecedented restrictions Tuesday on how people, governments and businesses can use water amid the state's ongoing drought, hoping to push reluctant residents to deeper conservation.

The State Water Resources Control Board approved rules that force cities to limit watering on public property, encourage homeowners to let their lawns die and impose mandatory water-savings targets for the hundreds of local agencies and cities that supply water to California customers.

Gov. Jerry Brown had pushed for the more stringent regulations, arguing that voluntary conservation efforts have so far not yielded the water savings needed amid a four-year drought. He ordered water agencies to cut urban water use by 25 percent compared with 2013, the year before he declared a drought emergency.

"It is better to prepare now than face much more painful cuts should it not rain in the fall," board Chairwoman Felicia Marcus said Tuesday as the board voted 5-0 to approve the new rules.

Although the rules are called mandatory, it's still not clear what punishment the state water board and local agencies can or will impose for those that don't meet the targets. Board officials said they expect dramatic water savings as soon as June and are willing to add restrictions and penalties for agencies that lag.

But the board lacks staff to oversee each of the hundreds of water agencies, which range dramatically in size and scope. Some local agencies that are tasked with achieving savings do not have the resources to issue tickets to those who waste water, and many others have chosen not to do so.

Despite the dire warnings, it's also still not clear that Californians have grasped the seriousness of the drought or the need for conservation. Data released by the board Tuesday showed that Californians conserved little water in March, and local officials were not aggressive in cracking down on waste.

A survey of local water departments showed water use fell less than 4 percent in March compared with the same month in 2013. Overall savings have been only about 9 percent since last summer.

Under the new rules, each city is ordered to cut water use by as much as 36 percent compared with 2013. Some local water departments have called the proposal unrealistic and unfair, arguing that achieving steep cuts could cause higher water bills, declining property values and dissuade projects to develop drought-proof water technology such as desalination and sewage recycling.

The board again Tuesday rejected calls to create easier targets for communities in drier areas or for cities that have been conserving since before the drought.

An economic analysis of the water board's proposal commissioned by the board estimated that private water utilities and local water departments would lose a total of about $1 billion in revenue through lost water sales if they meet the board's targets, meaning they are likely to raise prices to make up the difference.

Brown said last week he would push for legislation authorizing fines of up to $10,000 for extreme wasters of water, but he needs legislative approval to do so and no bill has been introduced. Another tool  tiered pricing, in which the price rises as water use goes up  is in question after a court struck down water rates designed to encourage conservation in San Juan Capistrano in Orange County.

 Volcano Activity in Japan on Tuesday, 05 May, 2015 at 09:03 (09:03 AM) UTC.
Description
The number of volcanic earthquakes recorded in Hakone, Kanagawa Prefecture, surged Tuesday, with 85 quakes recorded before 8 a.m., compared with 34 for all of Monday, the Meteorological Agency said. Of the quakes Tuesday, two that shook the area between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. were strong enough to be felt. They registered level 1, or the lowest, on the Japanese intensity scale of 7, the agency said. The focus of both was about 10 km underground. The agency said it still believes the possibility that the Hokone volcano will erupt is low, and it is maintaining the alert level at 1 on the scale of 5. However, hot steam could suddenly be expelled from the ground in or near the Owakudani Valley, the agency warned, urging tourists not to enter areas designated as off-limits. Local officials have barred visitors from entering recreational trails and hiking courses in the valley. The number of volcanic quakes began to surge April 26, though only two were recorded last Friday. However, 37 earthquakes were recorded Saturday, followed by 36 on Sunday and 34 on Monday.

 "The outer lanes of the turnpike were shut down near the crash scene, causing traffic delays in the area. The crash occurred on the exit that heads towards the Garden State Parkway and Route 9 in Woodbridge."

"The exit ramp from the southbound truck lanes to the toll plaza remains closed for road repairs.

Crews will repave a 200-foot section of the truck lanes exit ramp, and replace some of the guardrail.

They will be working overnight and plan to have it reopened by 5 a.m.

The exit ramp from the car lanes reopened earlier Tuesday afternoon."

 Mike Huckabee's Craziest Comments http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/mike-huckabee-still-talking-crazy-20110505

 Playing-it-coy presidential candidate Mike Huckabee is taking heat for comparing failure to act on the federal debt to  what else?  letting the Nazis get away with the Holocaust. "Let there never be a time in this country when some father has to look over his daughter's shoulder and see her ask the haunting question, 'why didn't somebody do something?'" he told a crowd of NRA members last weekend. (Steve Kornacki at Salon points out that Huckabee has used the exact same anology before, in relation to abortion.) 

It's an open question whether Huckabee is crazy like a fox or crazy like a ... lunatic. What's not in dispute is that he's some kind of crazy. If you have any doubts on that score, consider these collected Huck-isms.

Obamas worldview was shaped by a world filled with madrassas: "I do think he has a different worldview and I think it's in part molded out of a very different experience. Most of us grew up going to Boy Scout meetings, you know, our communities were filled with Rotary Clubs, not madrassas."

Hillary skipped the 2010 campaign trail to have an "alibi" when she challenged Obama in 2012: "She saw this train wreck coming and took off for Cambodia."

Obama never uses the word "terrorism": "[W]ith a liberal President - you're going to get universal healthcare, you're going to get higher taxes, you're going to get weak foreign policy, you're going to get a flat refusal to acknowledge the use of the term 'terrorist' or 'terrorism.'"

Homsexuality is like pedophilia, bestiality: "Well, I dont think thats a radical view to say were going to affirm marriage. I think the radical view is to say that were going to change the definition of marriage so that it can mean two men, two women, a man and three women, a man and a child, a man and animal."

Obama grew up in Kenya: "[I]f you think about it, his perspective as growing up in Kenya with a Kenyan father and grandfather, their view of the Mau Mau Revolution in Kenya is very different than ours because he probably grew up hearing that the British were a bunch of imperialists who persecuted his grandfather."

The U.S. financial crisis was caused by economic terrorists: "There may, in fact, be evidence of economic terrorism that is fueling a lot of what's going on. Now it's a fascinating idea, that if somebody could break down the world economy, it would have a greater impact that any bomb ever set off. It seems to be there is plausible argument for it."

We need a U.S.-Mexico border fence to keep out ... Pakistanis: The fact is that the immigration  issue is not so much about people coming to pick lettuce or make beds, its about someone coming with a shoulder-fired missile."

Mormons believe that "Jesus and the devil are brothers"
Or so he asked, wonderingly, at a 2007 debate with Republican presidential contenders, including (noted Mormon) Mitt Romney.

Related: In this 2007 Rolling Stone profile, Matt Taibbi concluded after much sober consideration that Huckabee, for all his personal warmth and charm, is "full-blown nuts, a Christian goofball of the highest order."



 









 (Reuters) - The federal Office of Management and Budget has granted U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack the authority to transfer an additional $330 million in emergency funds for the agency's handling of the quickly spreading avian influenza outbreak, USDA agency sources told Reuters on Tuesday.

The funds will be used to cover indemnity claims filed by poultry farmers whose flocks have been infected by the highly pathogenic H5 virus and other issues related to the outbreak, the sources told Reuters. The additional funds, added to the $84.5 million previously set aside by USDA for the outbreak, bring the federal costs so far to at least $414.5 million.

 lol. I like the summit house building! (called sanai's now). I say we trade the kennedy chicken place and those 2-3 buildings there to safe guard summit house:)

It's built of cool stuff! 

"The Newkirk House, also known as the Summit House, located at 510 Summit Avenue is the oldest surviving structure in Jersey City, New Jersey. The two-story Dutch Colonial building, composed of sandstone, brick, and clapboard dates to 1690.[1][2]

Originally one story, the outer walls are two feet of stone fitted in lime and mortar. Beams of timber in the basement are six-by-twelve inches and those on the second floor are four-by-six inches spaced four-feet apart. Eight-inch wood pegs, rather than nails, were employed during the time of construction."  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newkirk_House

I also like hawks   owls  hanging out and eating up any rats that might try to sneak in.

see this parking lot , and the 3 buildings adjacent to it?  the one along Summit date back to 1690. Think it will survive the blasting?

The Hilltop really is a family neighborhood, let them build across summit, where  that chicken place is. See all that green space that runs from Summit to Baldwin?  There has been talk of using that space as an access route for the construction project.  That area is full of wildlife, owls, skunks, hawks, etc, etc. Leave them in peace.

Never mind the dated infrastructure in our area that I don't see any mention being made to upgrade so as to accommodate all these new residents.

I realize the square is building up. How about we get those empty spaces (the one where kennedy meets sip) built up, and do something about those somewhat derelict buildings boarding the chicken place on the sip/summit corner before adding one of these monsters to a an space where we citizenry are up in arms against the development at this particular location.
 









 "SEDONA - Did you feel anything?

A magnitude-3.2 earthquake shook the Sedona area around 2 a.m. Tuesday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

The epicenter was six miles north of Sedona.

The Associated Press says no damage or injuries have been reported.

Meteorologist Iris Hermosillo says there are some fault lines in the state, so earthquakes here aren't uncommon. The earthquakes we feel, though, generally aren't very strong.

The largest earthquake in Arizona was recorded on July 21, 1959 at a magnitude of 5.6, the USGS says."

 "The United Nations and conservation groups have sounded the alarm about the ecosystem's failure and its ripple effects, which include the mass extinction of thousands of species of animals.

"Coral degradation is a global problem," said Luis Solorzano, executive director at The Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit organization working in more than 35 countries and operating more than 100 marine conservation projects."

"A world without corals would not only have economic and social costs, added Solorzano, but "our planet would be a very sad place."

 Chlorine leak stopped at Youngstown wastewater plant
By Gerry Ricciutti
Published: May 4, 2015, 10:21 am  Updated: May 4, 2015, 7:11 pm

 YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (WKBN)  It was quiet Monday evening at the Youngstown wastewater treatment plant on Poland Avenue, but it was a very different scene around 9:15 a.m., shortly after liquid chlorine started leaking from a pipe.

The Himrod Avenue Expressway between U.S. Route 62 and Interstate 680 and the section of Poland Avenue in front of the plant, between Gibson Street and Powers Way, will be closed until 8 a.m. Tuesday.

Shortly after 9 a.m. Monday, workers evacuated the facility after potentially hazardous liquid chlorine began leaking from a valve as workers were trying to switch one-ton tanks of the chemical, which is used in the water treatment process. Firefighters and HazMat crews responded quickly, put on protective gear and got inside and shut off the leak, but that was not the end.

Unfortunately, they lost about 500 pounds of liquid chlorine that remained in the building, that did not get mixed off, so we are going to have to slowly allow the air exchangers within that building to mix it with air and release it back into the environment, Youngstown Fire Department Battalion Chief Sil Caggiano said.

What complicated the problem is that liquid chlorine freezes when it is exposed to the air and firefighters found a lot of what had leaked had frozen in large puddles on the floor of the building rather than evaporating into the atmosphere. They now have to wait for the chemical to warm up and then dissipate. 

And until that happens, firefighters opted to close both Poland Avenue and the nearby Expressway, as well as the businesses inside the nearby Performance Place Industrial Park, as precautions.

Officials have said that, barring drastic change, there is no public health risk from the chlorine leak at the Youngstown wastewater treatment plant. It was contained around 11:45 a.m.

Crews on the scene were initially worried about wind blowing the gas towards the east and northeast and sent a truck with a measuring device to the east side of the Mahoning River to check for the presence of chlorine.

Fire officials are warning citizens to avoid the area around the plant and shelter in place, with doors and windows closed, unless notified otherwise.

Chlorine can cause irritation of the lungs and eyes, as well as difficulty breathing. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has put together a fact sheet on chlorine."

 "John Oliver Perfectly Describes the "Woman-Battering Human Landfill" That Is Floyd Mayweather

While issuing a takedown of Bud Light's awful new #UpForWhatever tagline last night, which included a clip of a woman calling the campaign a tad "rapey," John Oliver snuck in quite the perfect description of another awful subject, Floyd Mayweather.

"That's true, but it would be great if you could use a slightly more serious word than 'rapey'," Oliver said. "It's somewhat diminishingIt's like saying Floyd Mayweather is a smidge assaulty. It's technically correct but it'd be more appropriate to say he's a woman-battering, human landfill. That'd be more on the money."

 The Kliuchevskoi, the most powerful existing chain giants in the Russian peninsula of Kamchatka volcano, today launched clouds of gas-steam and ash to a height of seven thousand five hundred meters above the level the sea. Emissions were captured by the observatory of geophysics and volcanology, a subsidiary of the Academy of Science of Russia in the Far East. The wind spread the ash cloud at a distance of 40 kilometers to the northeast, toward the Gulf of Ozernovskiy, and does not represent a danger for the populations, the regional Emergency Situations Ministry, in a report televised on federal channels said. However, civil defense declared code yellow -alert averagely for aviation security and recommended to travelers refrain from organizing tourist expeditions in the area of the volcano, active since 1 January. Kliuchevskoi ranks as the largest and most powerful active basaltic volcano in Eurasia, with four thousand 850 meters. Actually it gives its name to a group of giants (Kliuchevskaya) located near the east coast of the peninsula as Ploski Tolbachik, Shiveluch and Kizimen responsible for the intense seismic activity in the region since late 2012. The Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East, is part of the zone of high seismic activity on the planet, the Ring of Fire    (from RSOE)

 No paywall here. This is the rest of the article, aside from the actual decision which op linked above.

"Federal agents do not have unlimited power to search laptops and other electronic devices without a warrant at the border, including airports, a federal judge in Washington said.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejected prosecutors arguments that a laptop was like any other container that could be searched at the border without a warrant. The border search doctrine had limits when it came to electronic devices, Jackson wrote.

Given the vast storage capacity of even the most basic laptops, and the capacity of computers to retain metadata and even deleted material, one cannot treat an electronic storage device like a handbag simply because you can put things in it and then carry it onto a plane, Jackson said.

Jackson is the latest judge to confront warrantless searches of electronic devices since the U.S. Supreme Courts ruling last year in Riley v. California. In Riley, the justices said police generally must get a warrant before searching a cellphone, acknowledging the vast amount of personal information those devices hold.

Citing Riley, Jackson said she would apply the same approach as the high court and weigh the degree to which defendant Jae Shik Kims privacy was invaded when his computer was searched against the governments national security interests. Kim, a Korean businessman, was traveling home from the United States in December 2012 when a U.S. Department of Homeland Security special agent seized his laptop and sent it away for a forensic examination.

She wrote:
The imaging and search of the entire contents of Kims laptop, aided by specialized forensic software, for a period of unlimited duration and an examination of unlimited scope, for the purpose of gathering evidence in a pre-existing investigation, was supported by so little suspicion of ongoing or imminent criminal activity, and was so invasive of Kims privacy and so disconnected from not only the considerations underlying the breadth of the governments authority to search at the border, but also the border itself, that it was unreasonable.

Jackson tossed out incriminating evidence investigators discovered stored in the laptop, which prosecutors used to charge Kim with violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.  

Kims lawyer, David Deitch of Ifrah Law in Washington, said Jacksons ruling made clear that the government will still have all its rights to protect the border if it is doing searches that are designed to thwart crimes that are afoot at the border crossing.

This is a really interesting and unresolved area of the law right now because, as often happens, were taking 17th century concepts of privacy rights and trying to apply them to 21st century technology, Deitch said.

A spokesman for the U.S. attorneys office in Washington said they were reviewing the ruling.

Jacksons decision was the second in the past year in the D.C. federal trial court to address warrantless searches of laptops at airports.
In December, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras rejected a motion to suppress evidence filed by another defendant charged with sanctions violations, Shantia Hassanshahi. Hassanshahi claimed the government lacked reasonable suspicion to seize and search his computer. He also argued the search was unlawful because investigators discovered his phone number using a secret law enforcement database.

Contreras found there was reasonable suspicion to search Hassanshahis computer. Law enforcement had reason to believe Hassanshahi was doing business in Iran, the judge said, including an earlier federal investigation into his activities involving Iran, his past travels there and the fact that he was carrying multiple electronic devices that appeared to be inconsistent with just personal use while traveling.

Jackson said that Kims case was different from Hassanshahis because there was nothing about Kims particular travel plans that would arouse suspicion; he was returning to his home in Korea and he was known to have business operations within the United States.

The next hearing in Kims case is scheduled for May 18."

 "REUTERS - Israel has reported an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu virus in the north of the country, two months after declaring a series of similar outbreaks earlier this year had been resolved, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) said on Tuesday.

High pathogenic H5N1 bird flu first infected humans in 1997 in Hong Kong. It has since spread from Asia to Europe and Africa and has become entrenched in poultry in some countries, causing millions of poultry infections and several hundred human deaths.

The strain is different to the H5N2 strain that has been spreading in the United States, leading to the death or culling of nearly 30 million birds so far."

 re South Dakota 

"South Dakota was the center of weather extremes Sunday, with a tornado damaging a small town and injuring at least nine people on the eastern side of the state and more than a foot of snow blanketing the Black Hills to the west."

"Farther north, a late-season snow fell in parts of the Rockies, western Nebraska and western South Dakota.

National Weather Service meteorologist Kyle Carstens said between 10 to 18 inches of snow was on the ground Sunday morning in the Black Hills of South Dakota and totals could reach 20-24 inches by the time the system moves out. Rapid City, South Dakota, had 8-11 inches, accompanied by 20-30 mph winds."

 "Tyler Moore and his father said they have been coming to the north end of Carolina Beach for the past 15 years and were shocked to see how much was gone.

"We looked down and were not expecting to see the drop off, because normally the sand over here is just about even with the rocks, Moore said, pointing to the sand along the coastline. Now it's probably dropped off 8-10 feet especially up under the pier so it was really a shock. Then we walked down the beach (towards the north end) and to see how much of the beach was gone was really surprising."

"However, Town Manager Michael Cramer said in the grand scheme of things those damages are minimal. 

"Really our storm damage reduction program is having the benefit that we want it to have and that is stopping any of the wave action from damaging business, damaging personal property, or our infrastructure, Cramer explained. So the fact that we have the dunes, that's working, and this is just a normal process of maintaining and keeping those dunes up so we don't have major damage when we have storms like this."

Kramer said the damage that was done is easily fixable. Officials are looking to add a few steps to some accesses that were hit the hardest by the erosion to make it easier for people to get down to the beach. 

Also, the town has contacted a contractor to re-stack the rocks along the 1500 block of Carolina Beach Road North, past the Carolina Beach Pier. Some of those rocks have been disheveled due to Ana's impact."

Any help would be appreciated, thank you! 




 I actually don't recall if I posted this here, I had on worldnews, but what with it's being Russia   all..so pardon me if it is a repost.

 mostly lovely racist sentiments   apparently taco marketing. No thanks! 




 can we erect a fence around them ? 









 why are you yelling at me?  




 what does that even mean? 









 I love you! thank you! 




 ok I'm going to try again heading it as "Junior the dog, unknown  breed, laying down on a bed of grass"

hope that will be ok. Thank you very much 




 Thank you so much. Junior meant a lot to us, so I do seem to get rather emotionally verbose:)  Ok would 'Junior, our rescue dog,laying down on a bed of grass' work? no idea what breed he was; just a darling animal.

( he really was hunting (unsucessfully) for chameleons :) 




 arg ok I suck at these submissions, I actually did read the page. 

ok I am sad now:(

Thanks for modding well, I thought I was doing it right. pardon meas I crawl into some corner   weep for a while, then make one more attempt.

 'The volcanic eruption warning on Mount Hakoneyama was raised to Level 2 on May 6, meaning that people should stay clear of the crater on the mountain that straddles Kanagawa and Shizuoka prefectures.

The Japan Meteorological Agency had maintained a Level 1 alert although earthquakes around the mountain intensified in frequency and strength over the past 10 days. This is the first Level 2 alert for the mountain since the system was introduced in March 2009....'

From RSOE "An eruption warning has been declared for the volcano, as increased seismic activity under the wakudani hydrothermal field were registered during the past days and could herald sudden phreatic explosions. The Owakudani valley lies north of the central lava domes inside the Hakone caldera. Seismicity started to increase in late April, consisting mostly of swarms of shallow quakes at 2 and 5 km depth. More intense swarms have occurred during the past days, triggering the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to raise the alert level of the volcano to 2. Simultaneously, slight deformation of the ground was detected and it appears that fumarolic activity has increased in the past days. Japanese authorities have closed access to the area, which is a popular tourist destination. After the deadly, sudden phreatic eruption of Ontake-san volcano last year, the risk of such eruptions has been taken very seriously. Whether or not an eruption will occur at Hakone in the near future is impossible to say. Similar seismic crises have occurred in the past with no eruption following. The last known eruption at Hakone occurred in 950 AD."

 MANILA, Philippines (AP)  A Philippine volcano has spewed ash for the second time in less than a week but there were no signs of any imminent violent eruption, the country's chief volcano expert said Thursday.

Mount Bulusan in Sorsogon province southeast of Manila ejected ash 250 meters (825 feet) above the 1,565-meter (5,165-foot) volcano late Wednesday, said Renato Solidum, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.

The agency asked local officials to keep people away from a 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) hazardous zone around the crater, he said. He said aircraft should not fly close to the mountain to avoid any sudden explosions and ash clouds.

Solidum said the explosion was due to ground water coming into contact with hot rocks and not rising magma. He says such "phreatic" explosions are typical of Bulusan. The ash explosion lasted about 3-1/2 minutes, shorter than the 5-minute explosion recorded May 1.

A large explosion in February 2011 that shot an ash plume about 2 kilometers (more than a mile) into the sky prompted about 1,200 villagers to flee to shelters.

Bulusan is one 23 volcanoes considered active by the volcanology agency, but it has not had a violent eruption since in 1918.

The country is in the Pacific "Ring of Fire," where volcanic activity and earthquakes are common. In June 1991, Mount Pinatubo in the northern Philippines exploded in one of the biggest eruptions in the 20th century. 









 GLENDALE, Ore. -- Fire crews worked through the night after a large fire broke out north of Glendale Tuesday night at Peavine Creek.

Firefighters are currently trying to contain the fire, working since 5 p.m. Tuesday after fire detection cameras spotted the blaze.

Douglas Forest Protective Association says its estimated that 123 acres have already been burned.

According to DFPA there is a fire trail around half of the blaze.

"As we're going along with the fire trail, we're pummeling it with water too so we can work on those hotspots, said DFPAs Kyle Reed. There's going to be a lot of work to go before this fire's contained but there's a lot of good work that's being done out here too."
     
Reed says there will be a 100 percent mop-up before they are done with this fire.

"With it being so early in the fire season, we have to make sure this fire's going to be good not only for a couple days from now or a couple weeks from now, but 2-to-3 months from now when we're in the peak of fire season."

Douglas County is in its third year of drought conditions. Reed says it's important to be careful when burning your debris or even mowing your lawn.

"Stuff that doesn't typically cause fires this time of the year -- we're going to see an increase in stuff like that, so people just need to be cautious when theyre working or recreating in wildlife areas."

The cause of the Peavine Creek fire is still under investigation.

 GAITHERSBURG, Md. (WJLA) -- A 28-year-old Missouri woman has been charged with sexually abusing a 15-year-old Gaithersburg boy.

Police say Garen Smith met the alleged victim while playing Xbox online. Investigators say she drove all the way from Missouri to connect with the boy.

According to charging documents, the boys mother invited the woman to move into the family's Gaithersburg home.

Smith and the boy shared a room and would push their mattresses together at night, according to records.

On her Facebook page, Smith says she is working on an R.N. degree, but she loves her video games.

Investigators say the alleged victim told them he and Smith had numerous sexual encounters. He said that she frequently said she was afraid of going to jail if anyone found out about what they were doing.

Apparently the mother became suspicious and communicated with police.


(you did see the part that said "the boys mother invited the woman to move into the family's Gaithersburg home.", right?)

 well they may be hunting down /u/MaltedFootball (don't even ask:)

or maybe they should have been given crayons or pastel sticks...idk, I know one of my friends used to tell me about the cougar that was living on her property  (texas). she had her protection ready if ever they were to cause any trouble. I miss that woman! 

Well I somehow have no worries of tigers   lions getting loose out there..oh but thank goodness you didn't mention bears!  
 Hope all will be well   safe , goodnight.

People living near the Three Mile Island nuclear plant may have heard a loud release of steam at 1 a.m. Wednesday as the plant was shut down after an electrical issue developed in the reactor.
The plant was taken out of service after a problem developed with an electrical component that operates one of the control rods in the reactor.

The control rods control the nuclear reaction in the reactor.
The issue with the control rod presented no danger or issue with controlling the reactor, said Exelon spokesman Ralph DeSantis.
He said the release of steam when the plant was being taken off-line was audible to nearby residents. Any radioactivity in the steam was too low to detect so there was no threat to the public or the environment, DeSantis said.

I suppose it's good they did this in November 2014, just in case   all:

 I'm jumping in here to remind you all of the pre-inca system of water management you may have read here at some point. 

Basically the system allowed for catching of rainwater during rain season, but kept it flowing   flowing until the dry season.

 oh go drown or something.. 




 I can not agree with you on that. We all need water. Let those with little funds die of thirst?  

So many people struggle just to make ends meet, to maintain a roof   a bit of food on the table. Would you have us collect rainwater in every available bucket, resulting in the alarming rise of mosquito borne illness which we are currently seeing running amok in places like Columbia?   http://outbreaknewstoday.com/dengue-cases-top-40000-in-malaysia-colombia-sees-10000-additional-chikungunya-cases-14946/

No. This is not the future I wish for my or anyone else's children.

Privatization of water must not be allowed to happen. Water belongs as a public sector element, and we need those government agencies that manage our current environmental troubles to step up and start doing the jobs they were elected to   for which they are paid.

Selling off water rights to private industry will result in nothing less than a disaster; the type that will make our citizenry rise up in a manner no one wants to ever have to see on a large scale.

 Read the news, a lot. 

Figure out which issues are important to you personally. Business   economy? Civil   human rights? Health   welfare? Environment? Military   defense? Science   technology?

Once you have a sense of where you lean on some of the various issues, start looking into where those running for elected office stand.

Educate yourself as best able on things that are important to you, make sure you register to vote, and use that privilege to get those that most agree with your viewpoints elected.

I also want to add that reading one article from one source on one politician is not enough. Read a lot of opinions/article from a variety of sources, and always consider the source when reading what they are saying.

 Just for the record:)    FAQs: H5N1 influenza
 
 Q1: What is H5N1?

H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza (or "bird flu"). Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60%.

Q2: How does H5N1 influenza spread to people?

Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual. There is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly prepared and thoroughly cooked food.

 from the article:

 " But the likelihood of success is about to shoot up exponentially, because right now we're barely trying." and

 "...the largest group looking for life, the SETI Institute, doesn't receive any government funding, and this particular aspect of space exploration has seen dwindling support.".

    

















































 Please prove me wrong??

As I read the original article I saw this quote: 
 
  "Pearl Jones, 81, said Friday she received a handwritten letter from Tonia Sonju, manager of Carlyn Estates Mobile Home Park in Palmetto, ordering her to stop taking deliveries of food from the nearby Hope Church, which was bringing boxes to about a dozen homes in the park, or she would face eviction." 

So apparently Ms Sonju is representing herself as 'manager' to the tenants.

   "This is about more than the food bank. It is people controlling others lives. 
    
    Its about the porches flooding every time it rains. 
    
    It is about residents being locked out of the club house for 3 months. 
    
    It is about bullies getting drunk and harassing residents, it is about people being evicted with out just cause. or then numerous trailers that have been sold with out tittles. it is about the owner telling people who they may associate with and if seen you are harassed. 
   
    It is about following people and embarrassing them for reaching out for help.
   
    It is about them telling people no one needs food in this park. 
   
    It is about a Disabled vet being threatened by her employee and her standing by and doing nothing about it. There is a video that clearly shows it. 
  
    No one is starving, that is news embellishment. But people are being denied the right to receive needed help"

 MADRID (AP)  Spain and Portugal  known for their sunny skies  are seeing record high temperatures for May, with thermometers hitting levels normally only seen in midsummer.

Spain's meteorological agency says the eastern town of Xativa recorded 42.9 degrees Celsius (109.2 Fahrenheit) on Thursday, breaking a 2006 record of 40.1 degrees Celsius (104.2 Fahrenheit) at Cordoba Airport.

Portugal also set a May record, with the southern city of Beja sizzling Wednesday in 40 degrees Celsius heat. Portugal's previous May high was 39.5 degrees Celsius (103.1 Fahrenheit) in 2011.

The stifling heat stretched across to Spain's Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, where temperatures of 42.4 degrees Celsius (108.3 Fahrenheit) were recorded Wednesday at Lanzarote Airport.

The town of Pego in Spain's eastern Alicante region was also fighting a wildfire Friday. 














 An outbreak of lead poisoning in Nigeria has killed 28 young children in Niger state, health officials told local media Wednesday. At least 65 cases were identified in Niger state, where the poisoning was linked to illegal mining. Although lead poisoning is not contagious, officials expressed concern that the affects had already spread into neighboring Kaduna state.

As of Tuesday, 17 girls and 11 boys all under the age of five have died from lead poisoning and more sick children are being treated. Farm animals were also affected by the lead poisoning outbreak, junior health minister Fidelis Nwankwo said Wednesday.

The devastating impact of this outbreak is associated with new mining sites, which were found to contain more leaded ores, which are often brought home for crushing and processing, Nwankwo told reporters during a press conference in Abuja. Additionally, the finding revealed a serious impact on our livestock with cows, goats and chicken most affected.

Illegal gold mining is a lucrative business for impoverished locals, who have concealed or denied fatalities and sickness from lead poisoning in fear of consequences. Local who bring rocks inside their homes and use unsafe mining techniques to process gold ore are at risk for lead exposure. Lead poisoning cannot be spread from person-to-person, but lead-containing particles can be transported and thus inhaled or ingested by more people.

[The outbreak] is currently spreading to neighboring localities in the state and Kaduna state, Nwankwo added.

Lead poisoning has killed hundreds of Nigerian children in recent years. In 2010, at least 400 children died and some 2,000 others affected from lead poisoning in Zamfara. The outbreak was caused by the processing of lead-containing gold ore in the northwestern state and lead contamination was identified in about 50 villages. The dangerous mining practice produced fine particles that contaminated water and food crops and were easily consumed by young children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

When inhaled or ingested, lead can cause damage to the brain, kidneys, bone marrow and other body systems in young children, the CDC said in a report last year.

 yea IK:)   Still not being sarcastic btw!

I am irl, but I suck at it on the net, so I have mostly given up :) 




 Whoa. Hold up.

The meningitis outbreak is in Niger I thought...Yes Niger has meningitis, Nigeria to Niger's south, has the H5N1 outbreak.

Also ..No more Ebola in Nigeria:)  So that is good. 
http://digg.com/2015/how-nigeria-beat-the-ebola-virus-in-three-months

Now if we were able to keep the diseases in their assorted corners..meningitis is a b.

EDIT: Nigeria does have a Niger state however. That's where the new lead poisoning outbreak is. 




  I like mountains. 

I once found myself up on one in Vermont in August, only to have the snow start spitting! 

Socks do not always make the best mittens:)

Stay warm. 




 no I wasn't being sarcastic.  




 yea, lot of appreciation for the attacked officer's partner, I'm sure.


 




 Good habit:) 

I agree, its a lot more fun!  (you should see me staring at the soil, or at the baby plants:)

I tend to save my seeds from year to year, which I also find oddly satisfying:) 




 Lol, IK:)

I do not generally editorialize, though I have taken the link title from a breaking news type of source and applied it to the article itself occasionally, if it explains the gist of the article better.

 TESTIMONIALS

We Have Found You Wanting

By Rose Schneiderman

Addressing the same audience [a memorial meeting held in the Metropolitan Opera House on April 2, 1911], Schneiderman (1866-1972), organizer for the ILGWU and the Women's Trade Union League read the handwriting on the wall. First published in The Survey, April 8, 1911.

I would be a traitor to these poor burned bodies if I came here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you good people of the public and we have found you wanting.

The old Inquisition had its rack and its thumbscrews and its instruments of torture with iron teeth. We know what these things are today; the iron teeth are our necessities, the thumbscrews are the high-powered and swift machinery close to which we must work, and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us the minute they catch on fire.

This is not the first time girls have been burned alive in the city. Every week I must learn of the untimely death of one of my sister workers. Every year thousands of us are maimed. The life of men and women is so cheap and property is so sacred. There are so many of us for one job it matters little if 146 of us are burned to death.

We have tried you citizens; we are trying you now, and you have a couple of dollars for the sorrowing mothers, brothers and sisters by way of a charity gift. But every time the workers come out in the only way they know to protest against conditions which are unbearable the strong hand of the law is allowed to press down heavily upon us.

Public officials have only words of warning to us--warning that we must be intensely peaceable, and they have the workhouse just back of all their warnings. The strong hand of the law beats us back, when we rise, into the conditions that make life unbearable.

I can't talk fellowship to you who are gathered here. Too much blood has been spilled. I know from my experience it is up to the working people to save themselves. The only way they can save themselves is by a strong working-class movement.

 Key facts

Avian influenza (AI), commonly called bird flu, is an infectious viral disease of birds.

Most avian influenza viruses do not infect humans; however some, such as A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), have caused serious infections in people.

Outbreaks of AI in poultry may raise global public health concerns due to their effect on poultry populations, their potential to cause serious disease in people, and their pandemic potential.

Reports of highly pathogenic AI epidemics in poultry, such as A(H5N1), can seriously impact local and global economies and international trade.

The majority of human cases of A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) infection have been associated with direct or indirect contact with infected live or dead poultry. There is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly cooked food.

Controlling the disease in animals is the first step in decreasing risks to humans.

(IMHO you may also be seeing a good price increase in food such as eggs, chicken, turkey, duck, etc. Not an expert!)  









 I seem to have misread your's as well:) 




 Actually..I'm more responding to your original statement:)

 




 In my experience, when people and their children are hungry they will work under the most horrid conditions, even at the risk of their life.

Also how often do we hear people that are the victims of awful events say, "You hear about this on the news. I never expected it would happen to me."

I'm pretty sure the workers there recognized a danger.  




 we haven't seen pissed off yet! (sorry it reads as 'distant')

  President Obama said the prospect of peace between Israel and the Palestinians is now "distant," but "A two-state solution is absolutely vital ... for the long-term security of Israel as a Democratic and Jewish state."

He said he was aware that some members of the newly formed Israeli government "don't necessarily believe in that premise ... but that continues to be my premise."

 U.S.- Gulf Cooperation Council Camp David Joint Statement (White House press release)

(White House needs a TL/DR person) 









 "CAMP DAVID, Md.  President Obama on Thursday offered Saudi Arabia and smaller states in the Arab world new defenses against potential missile attacks and maritime and cyberthreats from Iran, an effort to allay their fears that a nuclear accord with Tehran will empower their main rival in the Middle East.

But in a daylong meeting here, Mr. Obama stopped short of offering a formal defense pact that would obligate the United States to come to the nations aid if they were attacked."

 Completely unrelated Cyprus fun-fact from wiki:

" The Government has invested heavily in the creation of water desalination plants which have supplied almost 50 per cent of domestic water since 2001. Efforts have also been made to raise public awareness of the situation and to encourage domestic water users to take more responsibility for the conservation of this increasingly scarce commodity.

Turkey is building a water pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea from Anamur on its southern coast to the northern coast of Cyprus, to supply Northern Cyprus with potable and irrigation water (see Northern Cyprus Water Supply Project)."

 




 The hailstorm that lasted about half an hour, destroyed vineyards and half-grown tree crops and grain in Paphos, and cherry crops in Kampos tis Tsakkistras and Amiandos in Nicosia.

According to reports, vine growers said the damage was so extensive that their vineyards will not be able to produce grapes next year either.

 Exactly, this is worrisome. 




 The carefully negotiated bill, which President Obama is expected to sign, gives Congress the power to approve or disapprove of a nuclear agreement with Iran during a 30-day period when economic sanctions could not be lifted.

Should the House and Senate vote to disapprove of the deal, and then override a likely Obama veto, the administration would be barred from waiving some economic sanctions on Iran as part of international accord. 














 A woman who is believed to have sold around 30,000 poppies during decades of fundraising for the Royal British Legion was found dead just two days before the 70th anniversary of VE Day. 









 "An unseasonably cold storm will bring a blanket of snow to Southern Californias mountains Thursday while foothill residents in Los Angeles and Ventura counties could be in for potential mud and debris flows, the National Weather Service said."

There is a potential for isolated thunderstorms with dangerous lightning, small hail, gusty erratic winds, and isolated water spouts, a statement from the weather service said.

 'Melissa Klassen, a spokeswoman for the Prince George Fire Centre, says the amount of wood in the region left dry and damaged by beetle kill is also fuelling the fire. 

She does not expect the conditions to improve over the next few days. 

"What's challenging fire suppression efforts is this is the second year in a row that we've had higher than normal drought conditions in this region which is making this fire gain momentum as it burns through these very dense forest fuel," she says.'

 MACDILL AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. - We are aware of media reports that the second-in-command of ISIL has been killed in a Coalition air strike in Tal Afar and have no information to corroborate these claims. However, we can confirm that Coalition aircraft did not strike a mosque as some of the press reporting has alleged.

We have significant mitigation measures in place within the targeting process and during the conduct of operations to reduce the potential risks of collateral damage and civilian casualties.

 "VATICAN CITY (AP)  The Vatican has officially recognized the state of Palestine in a new treaty.

The treaty, which was finalized Wednesday but still has to be signed, makes clear that the Holy See has switched its diplomatic relations from the Palestinian Liberation Organization to the state of Palestine.

The Vatican had welcomed the decision by the U.N. General Assembly in 2012 to recognize a Palestinian state. But the treaty is the first legal document negotiated between the Holy See and the Palestinian state and constitutes an official recognition.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is due to see Pope Francis on Saturday before the canonization of two new saints from the Holy Land a day later."
