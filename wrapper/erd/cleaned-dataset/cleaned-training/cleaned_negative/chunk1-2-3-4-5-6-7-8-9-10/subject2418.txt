 Louis XIV described it as his "favourite nightcap" and a copy was found in Napoleon's coach at Waterloo. Bismarck and Napoleon III swore by it and, more recently, Hitler kept a copy by his bedside, where it was reportedly a constant inspiration.

 I had a followup interview for an in-store bank teller position. In-store meaning grocery store. The wonderfully flamboyant regional manager who was interviewing me said, "you'll need to leave the bank and entice shoppers to open accounts..." I told him that was fine. 
He continued, "you'll need to talk to them while they're shopping..." he stopped walking when we reached the salad dressing isle.
 
"What kind of salad dressing are you?" 
I realized this was not only a really goofy interview question, it was role-playing a big portion of the job I was after.

I grabbed Raspberry Vinaigrette and improv'd a bit about having a tangy and fun personality. He grabbed Cesar and said, "I'm more of a Cesar!" and he stabbed me in the back with the bottle. 

In retrospect, I think his joke would have been funnier if the salad dressing we called 'Brutus' 

I got the job.

 Looking up to him on the ground and in the air 





























 I woke up a bit earlier this morning so that I could get to the post office when it opened at 9am. I arrived at 8:55am and there was already a bit of a line underneath the awning that read: UNITED STATES POST OFFICE. The sun was shining on NYC and the people waiting were negotiating who was last in line; preparing for the doors to open.

I was being my cheery self, offering quips like, "I wonder what I'll get!" and "the anticipation is like waiting in line for concert tickets!" and "the waiting almost makes it better, you know?" 

The lady waiting next to me told me that they would open at 10am. We waited. I read a bit from my book and listened to music. Finally, a guy came out with a clipboard. People were showing their IDs and he was taking down their first and last names. People were allowed to enter six at a time. 

I entered the building and it was a large elevator. One floor up and to my surprise it was a food pantry. I asked about the Post Office and was informed of its whereabouts half a block down the avenue. 

So, in conclusion, I stood in line with people waiting to collect food for over an hour, saying things like, "I wonder what I'll get!" and "the anticipation is like waiting in line for concert tickets!" and "the waiting almost makes it better, you know?"

Horrible only begins to describe how I feel. 









 Exactly. The pro tip here is just TRY. Also, if the jacket isn't worth the time... don't bother.

 I just started working for a multi-billion dollar company in beauty and cosmetics. The company is 85% women, I am 100% man.

Today, in a monthly update the VP meeting, I joked, "it's strange to me that a multi-billion dollar beauty and cosmetics company provides employees with single-ply toilet paper."

I think it's fair to say my days are numbered.
