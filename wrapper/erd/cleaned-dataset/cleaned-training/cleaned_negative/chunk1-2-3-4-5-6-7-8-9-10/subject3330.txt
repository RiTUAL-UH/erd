 Other than the cutscenes stuttering the game is ace. 




 Yeah Queens Wrath was a joke, same content just re-skined pink. Same story missions re-purposed... The Queen requests kills, so go do this completely unrelated story mission. Makes no sense Bungie.

Haven't even tried Iron Banner, not even going to bother... The only thing that made me even remotely interested in the event was that gear and lvl actually matter... Seeing as thats not the case, I really dont care enough to try it. 




 I was watching your movements to see if they match on screen and it's surprisingly accurate. 

Going to try this out tonight. 




 The Hulk was French? 




 Except when you try to use the sprint so you can slide... and it doesnt work... you just walk forwards and crouch like a dumb arse.

Thats why this cooldown annoys me. 




 Tell me about it, the amount of times I've gone to sprint and slide in for a melee kill only to wind up walking forward and crouching...

 Obligatory:

[EVERYONE!](http://i.imgur.com/bot0NQ9.gif) 




 Id do it Sunday so it's ready for everyone going to work Monday. 

But that's because I'm a prick. 




 Looks to be the same size, full version should be an unlock.  




 Should now be working, if anything like Australia that is. 

Just started downloading here. 




 Why can't I pre load? I pre-ordered as soon as it became available on PSN specifically so I could pre load and play it a bit the night it comes out...

Guess I won't be doing that seeing as we're now down to 4 hours till release and still no pre load available.

I'm going to take a wild guess here... it's because im in Australia right?

*edit* 

Great, after complaining it now starts to download. 




 Op pls, I'll be waiting. 




 Reminds me of the short film [The Awareness](http://vimeo.com/82527075) 




 [The End?](http://i.imgur.com/JCpgIyT.jpg) 




 Reminds me of Tales From The Crypt: [Only skin deep.](http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNjgxNTM1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ4MTU2MjE@._V1_SY317_CR104,0,214,317_AL_.jpg) (Se6Ep02) 




 The box around their level will be / flash yellow when they have a super ready.

This can save your life in PVP, remember this. 




 This. I cant believe other people havent noticed this.... Or the fact their LVL will glow / flash yellow when their super is ready. 




 [Nothing special](http://www.bungie.net/en/Legend/2/4611686018428942993/2305843009214944103#gear) 




 Yeah I got [Skull Of Dire Ahamkara](http://destiny.wiki.fextralife.com/Skull+of+Dire+Ahamkara) from him a week or so ago. 




 Get Vanguard / Crucible to Rank 2+ and spend your hard earned marks on the gear you and need.

Work for the gear you want and you will have it. 




 Spawns at regular intervals at set locations on the map sure, but which one of those locations is random? 

I'm happy to be wrong though.  




 Special ammo sould be like heavy, limited / random spawns and you lose it if you die.

It won't stop the abuse but it'll cut it down a bit.  




 I doubt the tradition let alone knowledge of Halloween would have survived hundreds of years after the collapse of human civilization...

But hey, I could be wrong. 




 All the time, same with the PS Store just loading a blue screen with O in the bottom corner. 




 1.5 Million non-biodegradable balloons released.

Because fuck nature for a short spectacle right? 




 Destiny, your character, the events in the game... It's all a Vex simulation...

The Grimoire cards for the Vex detail how the VEX are running simulations of reality to better understand and predict human behavior in order to preempt our actions. 

One of the cards calls them the Architects.

While playing the game and you die, if you look in the top right you can sometimes see your cause of death as "The Architects"

Meaning you are indeed inside the Vex simulation and your life was part of the simulation where you failed.

You come back to life because they reload the simulation /  it cuts to another simulation to see what the outcome could have been.

Seeing as the Vex operate out of space and time for all we know everything including your initial resurrection has not happened yet or may never happen... It's just a simulation of one possible outcome.

TL;DR, You're in the matrix.
 




 The Ghostless Guardians, they know whats really happening in the grand scheme of things. They're following you, waiting for the right time to bring you into the fold... to bring the Traveler down.

*dun dun dun*

Nah, I have no idea haha. 




 Because Sharknado had an estimated budge of: $1,000,000.

Meanwhile Dredd has the estimated budget of: $50,000,000.

So why not make a second Sharknado, or 50 for the same price as a "big budget" flick that people want to see? Even if it is only to say they've seen it or like it ironically... 














 Think about it, he looks the same, acts the same and he disappears then reappears like magic always with something new to sell...same as Merchant.

Also thanks to Las Plagas he's able to live for centuries, unfortunately for  Xur though Las Plagas has left him all Cthulhu faced.

Thoughts? Complaints? Agreements? 




 So as expected there's a few already a few up on ebay at the low low price between $400 to $500+

So if there's anyone out there that desperate for one... I say wait haha. 














 So I got around to watching [The dark backward](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101660/) last night and am now looking for similar movies that have a grimy, bleak feeling too it.

The only other movies I can think of that compare are 

[Bad Boy Bubby](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106341/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

and

[Gummo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119237/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)


They're intriguing in a weird sort of way, so pass me any other movies you may know in the same vein as above! 

















































 After re-watching the Pokemon series Se01-Ep09 I have come to the conclusion that all the Pokemon games are not real events and are Games/simulations created by the Pokmon Technical Institute in the Pokemon Universe itself.

In the episode: Se01-Ep09 - The School of Hard Knocks. The Students refer to Pokemons Lvls, experience, and when/how they will evolve based on this information, same as the game. As far as I remember they never mention Pokemon in this manner ever again except in the games themselves.

Then they show the Pokemon battle simulator, which is an almost exact replica of the actual Pokemon games battle system.

So my theory is that in the Pokemon universe the Pokemon Technical Institute created the games as a Pokemon trainer simulator based on their research and their battle simulator. They released it as a training simulator to help up and coming trainers learn about pokemon etc. 

This is also supported by the 4th wall comments in some of the games from the Dev team.
such as:

* "I'm the game designer!"

* "I wrote the story!"

* "I'm the graphic artist! I drew you!" or "I'm the graphic designer! I'm a skilled dot artist!"

* "Me? I'm the programmer!".

None of it is real, it's all a game within the Pokemon universe itself.

Or something...

*EDIT*: 

The games have some semblance to the real Pokemon world with the characters and locations etc.
It also makes sense to add Team Rocket and other real world events to show the dangers and characters you'd meet in each region. 
All the while telling a game story thats unrelated to the real world.

 Howdy all,  

Recently back in Melbourne after backpacking around Murica for a couple of months, I've scored a job doing outbound cold calling for funeral insurance and needless to say it bites the big one haha.

I have 6 of years experience with Telcos, customer service, tech support, provisioning and more. 

Sooooo anyone here work in any call centers that know of any positions available, possibly pass on my cv?

I've been on seek and Gumtree religiously the last couple of weeks and had no luck so I figured why not see if anyone here can help me get a foot in the door. 

Thanks in advance if anyone can help. 




 Howdy all, I was recently over in NZ and a friend gave me a PSN card as a going away gift... But seeing as my account is an AUS account I have no use for it..

So I pretty much have a free $30 NZ PSN credit voucher available to give away.

If you have a NZ account and want this credit all you have to do is simply guess the  digit/letter where the "*"is in the code and it's yours!

"*"MQD - D6N9 - GB4A

Best of luck and enjoy


UPDATE: Code has been redeemed buy u/adelope, congratulations! 




 My vita has been stuck on NAT3 since I got the thing and can't play anything online.

I've already tried every option regarding port forwarding for the specific games and PSN itself, I've also set a static ip for the vita. 

I was looking through the firewall settings on the Thomson tg782t router and noticed some options for dmz but everything I've tried doesn't seem to work and I lost all Internet connectivity on all devices... which was resolved once I deleted the settings. 

So is there anyone out there that has the same router and knows enough to set up dmz for a specific ip without breaking the entire network itself? 

Or should I just give up and buy an actual good router instead? 














 Howdy all, I've been playing on and off for a year or so, but never put in any real time or effort... I want to change that haha.

I'll be moving back to Melbourne within the next week odd and was wondering if anyone on here either plays the ol' blues harp and is willing to teach a beginner a few things. Or if anyone knows of any decent priced places that provide harmonica lessons? 

I did have a quick look online but I'm not sure where to start or who/where would be good. 

Any advice is appreciated. 

Cheers 




 Morning all! Just arrived in your fine city 30 odd minutes ago, have nothing planned for the day so thought I'd try to annoy fellow redditors.

If anyone isn't doing anything later today feel free to hit me up, we can go grab a beer or something. I'll be chilling around central park mostly.

Oh and this city is massive by the way, beyond my expectations haha. 




 We get it, Microsoft has changed their drm and online policies. 

Stop posting it as new news when it's been posted every damn 5 seconds for the last hour. 




 Hey all, what's there to do and see over here while visiting for a few weeks? 

I also saw a thread a while back for the global meet up but the was no follow up/confirmation on the location, any updates on that? 




 So who wants to help arrange the (first?) Palmy global meet -up? If no one, I can do it myself haha. 

It's as easy as confirming how many people are going to show then booking a venue!

So who's interested? Suggestions and ideas? 




 I know palmy is small an all, but surely there must be redditers out there to keep this sub active? 














 It arrived at my local store today so I caved in and bought it... I know I could have imported it bla bla bla 

All i'll say is, it better be good since all I've heard the last couple of months is constant praise and adoration from everyone and their dogs... 

Though I have a feeling I'm going to be severely underwhelmed.

Either way I will be back to give my impression of the game... positive or negative. 




 Afternoon all, 

Sorry for the slow update regarding this... but ya'll know how it is.
The event will be held at [Dash Paintball](http://www.dashpaintball.com.au/front1.html)

Right now Im looking to collect the names and numbers of all that will be attending so I can book in the preferred date and arrange the transport.

So if you are interested throw me a message with your name, number and preferred date for the event.
(I will be going through the old thread and messaging those who said they were interested for confirmation as well.)

I look forward to seeing how many are still interested, hopefully enough to make two teams for a days worth of paintballing awesomeness!

[In case you missed it, here is the original thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/13cj78/rperth_paintball_meet_up/) 




 Sooo... I hear the world is going to end this coming friday? Something about a Mayan calendar prediction?  *shrugs*
Either way, its a good excuse as any to have a pool party!

So in saying that, If no one has plans for the coming apocalypse why not spend it drinking MaiTais, listening to some music while relaxing in or beside a pool? There may even be a BBQ!

I live central east perth, most know that already but for those that do not, throw me a PM for more details / address etc.

Oh and limited drinks will be supplied but I recommended BYO just incase. 














 Anyone else notice this? She is completely irrational and unpredictable, her actions towards the Governor have little to no justification or motivation other than she gets a bad vibe from him... And I mean Rick has treated her worse than the Gov ever did... with her personality she wouldn't let that slide, but this fact will be completely ignored for the sake of the story progressing. 

Hell I wouldn't have her around my group incase someone accidentally gave her a wrong look, shed prob off them then disappear into the woods.

At least in the comic she had a damn good reason for doing what she did.
In the show... she's a paranoid mute clusterfuck with a sword...
So far tv Michonne has been a disappointment, other than being fan service for sword zombie kills she's near useless. 




 Sooo it's me again haha.


I was wondering if there are enough people interested in a Paintball meet up... hopefully there are enough people interested to make up two teams. (you can even make your own team names or logo!)
I think minimum team size should be 4 so we can have a few matches 4 vs 4 but would prefer teams of 6 -8


It will of course be held on a weekend, the date is open and likely not to be till after christmas / new years as most people will have their calendar full at this time of the year. 
I'm just getting in early to see what number of people I can expect before making bookings and everything.


If I can guarantee enough people I will arrange transport to and from the paintball grounds. (I'll rent out a Van or two for the day)


The only expense you will have to cover is the standard fees for the Paintballing itself, usually between $30 to $70+ depending on the amount of paintballs you require.


I was thinking of this location / company for the event:http://www.wasppaintball.com.au/

Unless anyone knows of any others they prefer?


And for the alcoholics among us, I will try to arrange post drinks back in the city somewhere (most likely at Moon   Sixpence) where we can get drunk and regale on the events of the day. 

I would really like to make this into a proper event, make a day out of it, the winning team will even get a Trophy!

Thoughts?
Good idea, bad idea? 




 Howdy all!

Hope everyone is taking advantage of this amazing weather and is getting out and about, not locking themselves indoors on Reddit like myself.

I'm bored and have nothing to do, so it's either loiter around the in city, head to a beach, stay at home or Go Carting!

Anyone interested in coming along? I guess 3-4 people would make it more interesting. 

The only place I know of is in Belmont:
http://www.kartworldbelmont.com.au/
(8 Cowcher Place Belmont WA 6104)

If interested let me know.

*EDIT*
For those interested we'll get this started in about an hour. 1:30pm
So anyone who wants to tag along simply show up at Kartworld around that time.

We of course wont be able to race straight away and will be waiting in the queue so there will be plenty of time for any late comers to slip in.

*Double Edit*
Those who are responsable adults can get there easily with cars, those like me using public transport it will take roughly 40 mins from the city centre and a bit of a walk... just an FYI
 




 Sooo I caved and decided to buy the retail version rather than digital and I tell you what, I am happy I did.. at least now I can return it...

First of all it doesnt require an online pass so this is a major plus for those who may want to share/trade the game with friends.

Now onto my first experience with the online side of the game... I'm yet to be able join a game past the loading screen.
In essence the exact same issues that plagued Resistance: Burning Skies online multiplayer are still present.

The game goes to join, shows matched players and then begins to load... aaaaand then booted back to the main menu, I have repeated this time and time again only to have the same thing, this is present regardless of the game type I choose.(I have rebooted the Vita, double checked my network/router setting and everything is perfect)

So either the servers are at capacity at the moment or the game really is a simple reskin of R:BS, multiplayer issues and all.

In saying that, I'm willing to wait a week incase a patch is released or it is simply the servers being overloaded.

Am I the only one experiencing this issue?


(Side note: My connection is more than adequate for playing online, especially for handheld gaming, I am also on NAT2 on my Vita yet I am unable to join a single game... those familiar with trying to join a game in Burning skies both pre and post patch will know what I mean.) 




 Yeah you, in the tank....

Just finished watching Se1Ep1: Days gone by again, so damn good.
Its amazing to see how the show has changed, in pace, characters and their development, hell even the walkers have changed from being hinted as retaining some of their former self (the walker girl at the start picking up her stuffed toy, the wife trying to open the door) to being shown as mindelss drones.

that's it, just stopping by to see if we can get some discussion going on for probably the best pilot episode for any show ive ever seen. XD 




 Ladies and gentlemen, (and gingers)

The night has arrived, we'll kick things off from 6ish onwards.
I've decided not to decorate the place, too much effort haha.

There will be drinks and snacks / food, but feel free to bring your own if you wish.
Also movies, bring any you wish to share, or a hard driveif you just want to show up to pillage other peoples haha.

Seeing as it is still a halloween / horror themed night, dressing up will be encouraged,  but I have a feeling many people will not. 




 So im watching it for the first time as I type this and my god, Christian Bale, the man commits to every role he takes on doesn't he.
He was near unrecognizable at first, how on earth did he lose so much weight, just skin and bones...

Oh and the movies good so far, not sure why I waited this long to watch it. 




 The night of Friday the 2nd of November has been decided upon as the night for the movie night.
The night will start from say... 6-7pm and go for as long as people are willing to stay.

Bring movies, bring food, bring drinks, or simply just bri g yourself.

To those still interested either post here or PM me and I will reply with the address etc.

Also, will people be making an effort to dress up?
No pressure, not expecting anyone to. 




 Ladies and Gentlemen, 

I present to you a proposition of sorts.

I have been over in Melbourne the last few weeks and will be back in mid next week, as such I would like to arrange a Reddit movie night!

On the 26th of October or the 2nd Of November I would like to host a Horror movie marathon in honour of the night that is all Hallows Eve.
(or the 31st if enough Halloween purists are out there)

- Location: East Perth, Central City at my place.
Enough for 6 people on couches, plus more on various seats.
- Dress code: Casual but dressing up is encouraged.
- Drinks: Will be supplied, beer that is, possibly a ghoulish punch of whatever I find to mix at the time. (Or you can hit one of the three bottle store nearby)

Movie selection will be strictly horror, or any film that induces fear... (Yes Deaditor that includes Spice Girls.)

This will only go ahead if I know for certain enough people will show up.
So I know how much effort or if any effort to put into making this  happen. (decorations etc)

So what say you?
If interested let me know and I'll pass on more details. 














 Deaditor and I are out and about at Fibber McGees in Leederville, if anyone out there is bored and feel like a few cold drinks on this fantastic afternoon.
The more the merrier as they say.

If you show up, we're out back, just look for the odd ones out from the footy fans. 














 So I'm on my way to work and theyre setting up some thing for qutting smoking, seems to be a good 10 - 15 race cars.
Does anyone else find it amusing that they would try to help people quit by using cars to pump out noxious fumes?

Its like *here, quit smoking and breath this in instead*

Thats all, if anyone is in the city during the day have a look. 




 Howdy again all,

Since my last attempt at a movie night failed miserably, thought I'd try again this weekend.

Aaaaaand it also turns out this Friday is Friday the 13th, if no one has any plans(curse you folks who know of the dress up parties) I propose a horror movie marathon!
Same details as before, location is central east perth, 2 couchs that should seat about 6, bottle store across the road, bring your own snacks (though pizza being delivered is a very likely possibility)

Basically looking to have a few people over, drink and watch bad movies till he early hours.
Bonus points for keeping the neighbours awake as well.

If interested send me a message, oh and if not enough people show interest I'll call it off and also stop asking haha.
(hoping for at least 3 to 4 people to make it entertaining) 




 Howdy all, 

I know this may be late notice but anyone up or a movie night tonight? 
I have no plans and don't feel like going anywhere... so I thought I'd try to drag you guys here XD

the movie night will be at my place over in east perth, central city so its easy to get to.

I have 2 couchs so could seat 6 or so people.(they fold out to beds if required)
Bottle store across the road for any alcoholics that need their medicine XD

I have quite a selection of movies ranging from classics to downright abominations....

If interested shoot me a message, I only ask that you bring snacks and any movies you might want to watch, oh and that your not a troublemaker of course.
(also, I heard there was a snes at notsosillynorwegians movie night? Well I don't have one, only a ps3... but if anyone wants bring one, by all means)

On that note, I look forward to hearing how many/if any are interested, can reschedule for next week if need be.


*Edit*
so this has be rescheduled for next weekend.
If still interested send me a message and ill get back to you with the address etc.
 



















 So a new cheat has been found for Unit 13,  while in a mission press:

up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, X, O.

It's a variation of the Konami code and it changes the screen filter i.e: lowers the resolution so it looks like doom, inverts the colours, makes it look like ink drawn on white paper etc.... basically keep putting it in to change the look of the game, there's a good 5 or 6 variations.

Also, anyone know how to get the dancing and other hidden trophy? 




 Sooo, has anyone else noticed there's pretty much nothing coming out until mid/late may?
Guess I'll have to replay my current games. 




 Hi Perth Redditers!

Im not sure if you can help, and im sure you get quite a few of these posts on here... but I am in dire straights at the moment and desperately looking for work. So I thought I'd try all avenues, cant hurt right?
I've already done the usual, seek, Gumtree, Hays etc to no avail...


So a bit about myself, im 26, from NZ although I have been in Melbourne for about 5 years or so.
All my previous work experience has been call centre based, fully trained, cert 3 in telecomunications,  cert in QA, training in conflict / dispute management. 
Each position was either Customer Service or Technical support / helpdesk roles.
I have a very professional phone manner, excellent time management skills and high attention to details, proficient in many systems.


Sooooo, if anyone knows of anything along those lines that may not be found in the usual channels to job seekers, as ya know, its often who you know, not what you know.

Or if anyone knows of any positions available doing absolutely anything ill take it...
washing Cars? ill take it.
laying bricks, ill take it.
handing out flyers, ill take it.


As long as its not illegal im willing to do it.

Again not expecting much, but its worth a try right?
Thanks for the time anyone out there may have put in just reading this... even bigger thanks and even a beer for anyone who can help out.

 Its your plans for the day using your preferred calendar.

If you have nothing on your calendar today then it will show no events. 

Create something for tomorrow at say 6pm and it will give you a notification / reminder close to that time. 

Or if you check your agenda manually with that option it will show up. 

TLDR; you have nothing planned in your calender today.

 Nothing... Nothing at all... that what gave her the time to come up with this. 




 Oh cool, yeah noticed the 4 horsemen show up after the first completion.

Wasnt aware there was more than that... The game doesn't really explain itself very well. 




 Yeah I got bored of it after a couple of hours.
Beat it a few times with different characters, tried out a bit of the items and combinations, did a few of the challenges... But it got old rather fast.

I'll go back to it every now and then I guess as it's still a fun time killer. 




 I liked the episode about steroids where Robbie eats these small spiky creatures to get buff and winds up covered in spikes and being super aggressive...

 Cook in bulk and freeze portions to take to work over three days, after that you should have enough to alternate between for the next week or two.  Saving you both time and money if you don't like to cook. 

If freezing doesn't work for you just make enough for the following day and keep in the fridge. Stirfrys, pastas etc are quick, cheap and offer plenty of variety. 

Or get up earlier than you usually would  to prepare a lunch. Sandwiches and the like. 

Not only will you save money and eat better, you'll also learn new skills in cooking which is always a good thing later in life. 

Limit yourself to buying lunch to once a week.

Don't like any of the above advice? Then continue with what you're doing. You'll either get another job making more money or you'll change your lifestyle.  




 This and limit yourself to one "big purchase" per month. No impulse buys.

 For some reason it annoys me when people use the word peruse, as most of the time it's not used correctly...

 Peruse: 
examine carefully or at length. / read (something), typically in a thorough or careful way

So you read everything in the "on this day" or did you actually mean you skimmed through till you found something of interest?

 Now that you mention it... 




 A movie about a squad of  3 or  4 soldiers during a mission. The story you  can make whatever you want really. 

The default film is made from spliced footage captured from their helmet cams during the mission making one coherent story.

You could even make it in a way so you can watch each characters / soldiers feed independently showing a seperate individual story per character.

Effectively you can make it 3 or 4 movies in one go without any extra work or filming.

Games like Uncharted, Wipeout, Gravity Rush. As well as the announcement of titles like Bioshock, Warriors Lair etc. And showing the tech demo of MGS4 touting how easy they could scale back games to port across... which was pure hype to garner sales and line their pockets. 

These are hardly anime/jprg titles that plague the handheld market... But they are what we now have because Sony fucken bailed shortly after release and did nothing to push western developers to continue working on the Vita and burning bridges with the ones that wanted to.

I play my PS4 when I'm at home and I can wait 5-10 minutes to go take a shit 
without the need to pick up a Vita to continue my gaming session on the throne.

Myself and allot of other people bought the Vita because it was sold to us as a "portable console". Ya know, to play games on the go, not at home.

But where are those portable console quality games now? Far and few between. 

Where are the shovelware / indie titles?  Fucken everywhere... Not too mention they have already been on every device. I dont want to spend $15 on a game I played 2 years ago on my toaster. I'd rather spend $40 for a portable Resident Evil, Infamous or a new damn IP... 

My Vita has been gathering dust for some time and thats even after risking purchases on the slew of Anime/JPRG schlock thats prevalent on the Vita just for something new to play.

But hey I guess I should be grateful that Sony allows me to play PS4 games remotely all the while passing them off as Vita exclusives right?

But was not the Grounded mode DLC. 




 Different DLC, that was the Left Behind DLC. Which was well worth it.

But was not the Grounded mode DLC. 




 Yeah it came part of a bundle, but not the Left Behind DLC. 

It was The Grounded Bundle and it was for multiplayer maps, perks and weapons, not single player related at all. 

They also sold it stand alone at $4.99 USD. (Seems like the price went up, it's now $7.55)

I mean cool, It's nice they sorta threw it in along with multiplayer DLC and gave other people the option if they want it or not... 

But again they are charging for a level of difficulty, something they could just patch in.  

Let the circle jerk continue I guess?

Edit: clarified a bit. 




 Didnt Naughty Dog do this with The last of us?

They released paid DLC on PS3 that was a harder difficulty...They charged you for a level of difficulty... The worst part is people still fucken bought it.

 Serious question, what the hell is up with the current trend of releasing "teasers" for a trailer of an upcoming movie? 

"Oh hey, you know that movie you know is coming out? Well here's a teaser trailer that the actual trailer will be out soon..."

What's next? They're going to do a press conference to announce an upcoming teaser of a teaser of the trailer for their movie... Why not just skip the bullshit and just release the trailer...?

It seems people care more about the hype and publicity surrounding movies / entertainment than the final product these days.

 It can play Vita games, PSX games, PSP games and remote play PS4 games. So it has a decent library.

It's not actually a bad little device,  it's just that the memory for it is way too expensive, the native Vita games library is very JRPG heavy with little else available. 

It's not something you'd buy without research... otherwise you'd be somewhat disappointed.

He also makes an arch nemesis: BUSH MEAT.

 Dont you give them to her in the hallway outside after the mission?

The one I gave her was when she was in the hospital ward. 




 Yeah I had already done that side quest.

This is after that, I was walking around taking to people and you hand her the one vial of Antizen and she says that it should be enough to get through the week. 




 Client side prediction, after the slow motion the game will speed up / slow down certain elements until everything is back in sync for all players.

Thats why there are sometimes jumps or skips afterwards, looks like lag but it isnt. 




 Heh, seems like I'm the only one that enjoys to dance around them...

Get in close and shank a few times then dash backwards or to the side, rinse and repeat.

late game it becomes harder as the range of their slam increases and a single dash will not evade it.

Still more fun than ranged combat, but to each their own.

 Theres a mission in Old Town where you have to get into an office building through the roof and it is controlled by Rais's men all with guns.

I didnt have any guns on me (had them in my stash) so I kept getting close, throwing fireworks onto the roof and running away.

Eventually a hoard of Volatiles came and bought their fury down upon the yellow wearing bastards. 




 You give that vial to the Doctor in the tower, well I did at least...

 




 Also has plenty of Dudes in distress as well.

 Just make it a collection of intersecting stories from all the characters he met / had a history with and having John wick as a background / cameo character that ties it all together. 

Basically make it Sin City in the John wick style/universe.

 A lot of the subtitles dont match the actual speech, it's pretty common / standard in games for them to simplify the subtitles in order to fit more information in the small time frame they have it being displayed.

But this one in particular would be a translation issue, since the Devs are Polish. 




 Well I'm sure the 7 year old you would appreciate being Bart Simpson?  




 Why?... [Because](http://i.imgur.com/3swLquz.jpg) 




 Yeah EU/AU usually have a delay in games, be it physical or digital, but when the pre-load timer is counting down for 27/01/2015 and that is what was advertised on PSN... You sort of expect what is advertised dont ya think?

No one has the actual reason for the PSN screw up, some people claim Techland uploaded the wrong version of the game (Some people got an Orange launch icon that did not work / linked to nothing, while others got a Black one  that worked) or supplied Sony with invalid / wrong licenses... Or Sony themselves just plain screwed up the release.

I'd go with the wrong licenses being issued to unlock the game as a few days after release I got a PSN notification from Sony saying to go into settings and restore licenses to fix the issue. 

That and when I check my media through the SEN website there are two version of Dying light there.

(There was a manual fix some user found out to fix it before Sony even took action. If you had the wrong version / license, (Orange Icon) you had to purchase / download a free theme, this would for some reason cause PSN to reissue you with the correct license (Black Icon) allowing you to push the download to your primary PS4)

And on topic of the quality of the game, yeah it's pretty good, repetitive but still fun.
Almost quit playing at the start though, 3 times I lost all my gear after sleeping in game and turning my PS4 off. 

Why?

Because the game has a glitch that resets gear and levels after sleeping but not progress... The only way around this is to do another activity to force another quick save. There is no way to manually save to avoid this issue either. 

It still has not been patched... The game and launch is hardly perfect as OP is claiming.

 The game had a terrible release outside of the US...

Physical release delayed for Europe / Australia and many more locations for an entire month, those who pre ordered the physical version and dont have money to waste to get the PSN digital release need to wait another month.

PSN Store screwed up for those who pre ordered / pre loaded, stopping people from being able to play the game 3 or more days after release... All with little to no acknowledgment from Sony or Techland.

Whether it was Sonys fault or Techlands it doesnt matter, it left a lot of people unhappy and unable to play the game they paid good money for.

For the ones that still need to wait another month will be bored of the game when it comes out after being inundated by all the information, pics, videos, playthroughs over the next month.  




 I've notice most American comedians yell the punchline if not their entire routine. 




 Yeah theres a particular species I read about where the female protects the eggs for about 53 months, starving herself the entire time till they finally hatch... Then the hatchlings proceed to eat her dead or alive.

 I played this a few times, we called it Wisest Wizard.

We also had the rule that after every 2 cans you either have a shot of something or a bong hit / toke from a joint.
 




 I get invaded 2 - 3 times a night, but can never join a game, everyone disconnects straight away.

Why dont people set their games to private if they dont want to get invaded... It's annoying to all involved setting it to public and quitting / getting kicked every single time. 




 I left and did another side mission, came back and killed the virals that had spawned and it triggered the next part. 




  You have 48 Hours.

A few missions later.

 You've been out for three days.

Uhhh... ok.jpg

 I'd say it's like I Am Legend, as they started off as mindless grunts killing and eating everyone.. But given enough time they evolved/changed to become the dominant life form and created their own social structure etc.

So yeah, you could be right. Some of the long time turned carry and use weapons, they also have ability to "change" back into Virals. 

That and when they "evolve" into other forms they seem to retain some form of self preservation and higher cognitive function. 




 Yeah I checked with the Quatermaster, all shops / survivor shops.

I've continued playing through most of Old Town without it, but yeah... It'd be nice to have back for online invasions.

Guess I'll have to wait til I finish the game and start a NG+ to get it back haha. 




 I completed the Rais mission where your gear gets taken and once I got my gear back I had everything sans my UV torch...

I've checked my bag at a safe house, quartermaster and all shops... No one sells them or anything. 

I've continued playing as its not really needed for single player,  volitiles are easy to avoid / escape from without it. But I'd like to continue playing online against invading Hunters... and no UV torch = no chance. 

Anyone know if there's a fix or a way to get a new one? 




 I first noticed this with the machete on the desk for the ultimate weapon challenge. 

It's a nice touch.  




 They're only still "there" when freshly turned. After a while they cease to be. 




 All missions show on the map, even passing comment missions show as an icon on the map.

Check it out when you play next. 




 Agreed, you already have the scavenger sense dealio that shows where they are... through walls... And is unlimited with no cool down... You don't need them on the map at all times. 




 Eh, I'm only surival lvl 7, agility 8 and power 6 odd.... And can survive the night easily.

Heck most of the nights I dont even get seen and the times I do I can outrun them easily.

Those who claim its hard or really scary must be as soft as raw cookiedough.

The game is fun but hardly the scariest thing ever.  




 !: Complete the prologue first

2: ???

3: Profit

Edit: Sorry man, not sure... I only got the Urban outfit DLC and that was unlocked after completing the prologue...
Heard there was something about "tickets" that you can redeem for weapons etc, try looking that up. 




 Complete the prologue first? 




 It's part of the planned DLC:

- The Bozak Horde: The final Season Pass drop will deliver a new map and gameplay, playable in either single-player or co-op. Go inside the Harran Stadium, the most famous landmark in the city, and test your combat know-how against relentless hordes of the Infected. Fight increasingly stronger and larger enemy waves as you oppose a mysterious psychopath called Bozak. 




 Damn son, did you only do the main story / no side quests?
Did you do no exploring and just ran from point A to point B?

I mean, it's cool if you did... but that sort of defeats the purpose of these sort of games. 




 Eh, the story/campaign is only part of the game and it does drag on... 

The survival mode is where the game shines the most, I stopped playing the story about halfway through and stuck with doing short stints in survival. Was a lot more fun. 




 Best use was in [Last Action Hero]( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=60NVfBSdOG0)

 Sorry, I should have specified, this is applicable to those who pre-ordered or were able to purchase it before Sony took it off the store.

If you haven't purchased it yet... You're out of luck till they fix the issue. 




 They screwed up the licenses, some people are claiming they uploaded the wrong version on the game onto the PSN.

For those that pre-ordered some could download/pre-load it fine, others it would only download the DLC and others couldnt download anything at all and got a message "no content found, search the playstation store?"

There are two fixes available to get around this though, the first it set the PS4 as your primary then go to the PSN store website on your computer.

First remove Dying light from your pending download list then re-add it. It should then push it to your PS4 to download.

If this doesnt work it's because you've got the "wrong version". 
You can see which version you have based on the icon you have in your games list, if Orange... you have the wrong version/license. You need to have the Black hands one.

On your PS4 download / purchase something free, like a theme. After you have done this you will notice the icon for dying light will have changed from the orange one to the black one.

After that repeat step one from the PSN store website.

Basically someone somewhere screwed up and Sony refuse to acknowledge it.

 I love how some people are so creative they have time, vision and ability to do stuff like this. 

And here I am on reddit all day while at work, only occasionally participating in psbattles... poorly. 




 Good luck?

Who needs luck? 




 Main issue for me is the controls, using the rear touchpad for reload / grenade was a poor choice... 

When its hectic they're unresponsive, you pretty much need to swipe the entire back pad instead of a quick flick. 

I find myself having to swipe quite a few times to even reload and also throwing grenades at my feet because of this.

They should patch in the ability to remap controls. 

Other than that is not too bad.  




 No comment. 




 I took this photo 3 years ago at a random art gallery when I visited Perth.

Not that I didnt try to find the artists details, I did credit the art gallery in various posts. 

The artist himself has since messaged me and I have amended my posts to credit them directly.

But thank you for your input. 




 Which means there was always a chicken nearby,  watching... waiting... 




 If anyone wants to try to find the decks or the artist, hit up Ihart productions.

Edit:

Turns out the update has locked me out of all digital content. Everything has the padlock symbol  and has the error "cannot use the content. Cannot connect to the server to validate the license."

Cant browse the internet on the ps4 either, another error: "Cannot connect to the Internet" CE-33991-5

Either psn is down or the update is fucked

 It's all about progress not perfection, you're getting close to the later though, keep it up. 




 Snap, guess I was way off. Thanks. 




 It has plenty of good console quality games, along with PS2 and PS3 ports. 

Granted Sony has all but dropped support for the western market and relegated it to an indie and remote play device... On the Eastern side though, there are more JPRGs and the like than you can shake a stick at if that's your shtick.

But again, point being it has console quality games on it.
 




 PS Vita? 




 Yeah you can wait in game and screw around in the tower till it's fully downloaded. Or you can go play something else etc.

If you go back to the home menu and press the option button on the Dying Light menu item then go to information / details you will see the file size downloaded / remaining. 




 Pre install is like 5 or 6GB, the full game is 16GB

You need the full game to be downloaded before you can progress past the intro / elevator. 




 I havent played it myself, but Lords Of The Fallen seems to be what you are looking for? 




 Not sure how that would intimidate... I see that and think "Well theres a guy with extra weight and limited mobility, easy target"

 I'm level 59 and lost 75k odd last night, didnt even care. I can beat the enemies in the area easily and more than likely the upcoming bosses at my current level.

You get to a point where collecting echos becomes secondary, it's all about advancing. 

When you hit a wall and feel you cant advance then yeah, you start to farm again. 




 Thats my strategy as well, works perfectly. 




 Nope, this is how I've handled him every time I fought him, even when helping other players. 

Keep your distance but not too far away or he'll do his frenzy attacks, just close enough and he'll do that one swipe which you can avoid easily.

At the end he goes crazy and I get tagged a few times before I get back into the rhythm of the attacks.

 I'm not saying that all, what I'm saying is this a gameplay mechanic in almost every single rpg ever made.

Run out of an item? 

YOU NEED TO EITHER FARM FOR IT OR USE YOUR CURRENCY TO PURCHASE IT.

If you dont like that then tough shit. 




 And a group of woman is called a "Gossip" 




 When you get more than 20 of the health items or bullets they go into storage.

So If you run out and die, rather than farming go back to the hunters dream and restock.

If you run out of both... Then yeah, you have to farm or purchase them. That's a simple gameplay mechanic present in most if not all games. Or do you expect games to just hand you what you need so you dont need to actually play the game?

Heres my [trophies](http://psnprofiles.com/trophies/3431-Bloodborne/DukeDuG) for the game, I'm still at the start and only just beat the Cleric Beast. After that I was farming and found I could get easy gems from [This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sxCinAZrqU) 




 I've been getting them from that big guy with the cleaver at the very start of the game. Every other kill he'll give me a variant of them.

Not sure if I'm lucky or if people killed him once then ignored him after that.  




 If you have unlocked the slide kick... use that as it breaks their leg and kills them in one hit.

It's stupid but I guess in a zombie apocalypse a broken leg is a death sentence.

 I'm aware and fine with that, when the game is released. 

Not in alpha, especially after already paying an access fee to test their game.

 




 I have brought great shame upon my family... 




 Wait.. isnt the final game going to be free?


Why are people paying to play an alpha / to be a tester... as well as pay a monthly sub fee to do so.

Remember the days when companies paid people to test their games, when games came out as final products and DLC / expansions where an after thought and not part of the games build / business strategy...

You can pick them, up for about $99 these days, if not cheaper.

They're confortable, the sound quality is decent, battery lasts a few days on one charge, they support different sound profiles / uses the PS4 app to change equalizer settings, and well... they're wireless which is always a plus.

 No they are not, I have lost two accounts so far.

The first one I had since PSN first launched, I spent months fighting with Sony to recover it after it was hacked... I had over $2000 worth of digital content on that account, games for PS3, PSP, Vita, and PS4... Sony said they could not verify any of my information. I guess as it had been changed, the name, address and email had been changed more than 3 times... Apparently their system doesnt keep record of the original information if it is changed enough times. So too them I never owned the account, all the receipts of purchases were useless, all the information I could provide was moot, there was no way I could prove it was my account.

The second time it happened, within the same year I might add... I didnt even bother trying to recover it.

I have since cut back majorly on using PSN to purchase digital content, and if it werent for all my firends being Sony/PS4 users I would have switched over to XBOX or PC.

 Yeah I know how and why the US/AU price difference works, and I'm generally ok with it.

But this... this is obscene, collector editions etc are usually around the $129AU mark, which is still high but whatever.
I really hope no one purchased this edition off PSN... 




 What the fuck, who in their right mind would pay close to $200 for a game, a digital copy at that... Not sure what the price is anywhere else but I'm sure it's still going to be way too high.

 He probably thought Nutella was a health food and joined a class action lawsuit after he found out it's not really all that good for you.

Meaning he is either retarded or he jumped on the bandwagon to be part of the lawsuit in hopes of getting some money.

Just a guess. 




 Heh, I stand corrected. I just did a search and yeah, it is [rather big...](http://attackofthefanboy.com/news/final-fantasy-type-0-hd-ps4-larger-file-size-xbox-one/)

As others have mentioned, some PS4 games will download a part of the game, the intro, sometimes a prologue section that you can watch or play while the rest of the game downloads. 

That seems to be the case here. 




 Well yeah, it's an up-scaled PSP game... Dont see how it would exceed 4GB regardless of the changes.

 "Hey guy, buy our incomplete game at full price. We'll patch in the missing content at a later date, you know, the stuff that we promised would be available at launch. The stuff we even delayed the release for... But dont worry, the game looks good, shiny like.

Feel like the base game content is a bit barebone, a bit sparse? Dont worry, we've got all this other content coming out for you... Which you can pay for, as single dlc packs or as a (*snickers quietly*) season pass.

Whats that, is this an early access title? No, it's a AAA game (*chortles audibly this time*) so dont worry, we'll have all the content and bugs fixed by the end of the games life cycle... But thanks for your $56.95 + $27.95, we may choose to provide this content for free to other users who purchase this game once it's complete.

So yeah the campaign line up sucks... I'll reserve judgment till they release a track list of whats available on GH-TV and what they have planned down the line.

The two actually began as a single game with a common code base.[22] During the testing phase, the player would be able to fly the Warhawk ship around the first arena of Twisted Metal and fire weapons at the cars below

 A quick search reveals it to be:

Brand: Hohner 

Type: Tremelo Harmonica 

Model: Echo 32 (Or Echo M) 

Year: 1940s...

Without spending more time on it that's the best I could come up with.

Edit: /u/deadheadphonist beat me too it, with more information to boot as well. 




 I'd actually love to see this as one of those time lapse videos, it goes through all the same photos, same poses but you see everything change as it goes along as you described. 




 I find this fact both fun and informative, thank you. 




 When you're right you're right, I dont know anything about their finances, but that's not what was being discussed. 

Being a games developer, as you are, do you any input on my above comment past "You dont know about how they handle their finances"

Do you think I am wrong or have a misguided view on how easy it would be to apply a language patch the original PSP game?

In your experience how long would something like that take? how many staff? Would there be any licencing hurdles they'd have to jump over to get the game out on another platform? HOw long would the certification process take before distribution was feasible? Would the cost of these things outweigh the potential profit?

Or you could just give another witty retort. 




 Hi. I specifically said Type 0 PSP, nothing about the HD version.

They do not need to port anything, the PSP version is there, complete, ready to go, albeit in Japanese. The fan base did their own translation and patched in themselves. 

Square Enix can release it to the west as is, if they wanted Or they could apply an official english patch (Which would be easier now since they have the entire game translated thanks to the HD release) With little work. I'm not saying no work, I'm saying negligible work for a company that size.

Once more for reading comprehension sake, I said Type 0 PSP. Not Type 0 HD. 




 Type 0 is a psp game. The vita has psp emulation. All they need to do is apply a translation patch and release it on PSN.

Dont say its not that easy either because that is exactly what the fan base has done. 




 They can and did.

Unreal Tournament III on PS3 had mod support that you could import via usb. 




 Guess I'm in the minority here but I got bored of it really fast, played it for a week and havent touched it since. None of my friends are playing it either... Different strokes for different folks I guess.

 Try lowing the saturation / set the layer type to overlay and the opacity to around 40% to make it look more natural.

For example I lowered the saturation of your pic and [this is the result](http://i.imgur.com/cu6BNUZ.jpg)

Theres also a few spots where colours have bleed outside of their respective areas, the girls hat in the bottom left, the red bag onto the mans arm, the boys face middle right etc.

Other than that you're off to a great start, keep it up. 




 Sure can, the handle is on the left.  




 Look all I'll say is you are not the target demographic for those films and thats fine.

The number of quality movies made on lower budgets with little to no special effects far surpass the Hollywood dribble you obviously take issue with. 

As with everything in life if you rely purely on face value / advertising you will get the most superficial crap around. That's where you're at now.

So, go do some research yourself, take a risk and watch some international films, they are plentiful and you'll find quality thought invoking films from the world over.

Or you can sit on the internet and complain how you only see "geek culture" permeating theaters... Either way I dont care, I know there are thousands of films made each year catering to all audiences. You too can take advantage of that or just take whats thrown in your face by Hollywood advertising. 




 Burnout Dominator is better, though I think you need a PS3 to transfer it across. 




 No it really doesnt, this screams publicity. 

His agent probably heard the news of the guy and his Gosling cereal shtick and how he'd just died. Then he would have noticed an overwhelming demand for Gosling to respond..  Ask8ng him to jump on the bandwagon to keep socially relevant by pandering to the Internet crowd. People love a celebrity who "cares".

Character would have been if he had recognized the dude existed  and done this before the he kicked the bucket . 




 I got this [Pacman tat](http://i.imgur.com/S6dSF.jpg) years ago. 

[It's faded allot since I got it](http://i.imgur.com/bF2Ia.jpg) 




 Bullshit, pure and simple.

You may see superhero movies advertised more this is a given with their larger advertising budgets, this does not mean there has been a decline in the quality or number of serious / drama movies in theaters at all.

Hell, jump onto IMBD and looking at the number of Drama movies released in 2014 / 2015 and then compare that list to superhero / action movies.


In fact, here are a couple of highly rated drama movies I've pulled from my ass on a whim:


*  The Water Diviner  
*  The Longest Ride  
*  Child 44 
*  The Imitation Game  
*  Unbroken 
*  Gone Girl  
*  Whiplash  
*  Woman in Gold  
*  Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) 
*  Inherent Vice 
*  The Theory of Everything 
*  Fury 
*  Wild  
*  The Wolf of Wall Street 
*  Cake 
*  The Grand Budapest Hotel 
*  Still Alice  
*  Boyhood 
*  Foxcatcher 

And here are the super hero movies from 2014 / 2015:

* Captain America: The Winter Soldier
* The Amazing Spider-Man 2
* X-Men: Days of Future Past
* Guardians of the Galaxy
* Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
* Avengers: Age of Ultron
* Ant-Man - NOT RELEASED
* Fantastic Four - NOT RELEASED.

Thats it, now that hardly seems like a flooded market no does it.


So again, advertising makes the difference here. And seeing as you are not the target demographic for superhero movies of course it seems like all there is available at the theater is those movies. 

but yeah again, you are wrong.

 Hey Melbourne people! 

I doubt anyone will see this but it's worth a try.

I've been toying with the idea of organizing a "pop up cinema" around Melbourne. I'd like to organize a monthly or bi monthly event at different locations around Melbourne doing screenings of classic, new, cult, indie, B grade/bad films and of course Aussie/local films. 

I'd love to do themed nights (Bad movie night etc.) and have people get involved by voting for what movies they'd want to see, the next theme, preferred location. 

I already have most of the equipment required, other than venues and licencing...

I've briefly looked into the licencing, permits etc that would be required but haven't given it too much thought as I'm not sure if I could garner enough interest / enough of a following to make it worthwhile.

TL;DR

I'd like to see if there would be any interest in a pop up cinema around Melbourne with themed events that caters to movie lovers? 

Ideas? Thoughts? 




 1982: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Game.

Atari obtained the rights to make a game based on the ET movie, they paid one person to design and make the game, not only that, they only gave him about 5-6 weeks to do it in.

Their motivations were not to please the fans, or to create art, it was an opportunity to cash in on a popular franchise / brand recongition, it was an investment and they were looking for a quick turn around on that investment.

Nothing has changed since then, gaming has and always will be a business and as with all businesses the objective is profit, if you can make a good product, even better bu profit is the bottom line. Like it or not. 




 As a fellow Doug you are putting our name to shame... 




 Wrong!

Bananas are slightly radioactive because they contain potassium and potassium decays. Potassium is a necessary substance for healthy operation of your body. You would have to eat a LOT of bananas just to compete with the natural potassium dose of your body. But we're talking about genetically engineered Bananas here...

 So they'll all get cancer from eating too many genetically engineered Bananas... Or they themselves will mutate and turn into a giant banana like cocoon that when ripe peels back to reveal a delicious human/banana hybrid... because life, uh, finds a way.

 Honestly, I think I may have been a bit over leveled by the time I reached her so her attacks didnt bother me as much.
 




 Thats nothing compared to BF: Hardline on the PS4 PSN...

$99 Standard edition - This is expensive for a glorified mod but ok, whatever.

$109 Deluxe Edition - Same as above, only they give you a few battlepacks, basically you are paying to to unlock in game content with real money... Which is stupid, but whatever, some people are ok with that I guess.

$179 Ultimate Edition - Thats right, they took a glorified mod of BF:4 by removing most of the weapons and vehicles, tacked on a shoddy story... Threw it into a "bundle" by "giving" you access to locked in game content through battlepacks or whatever they fuck they are called and then sell it at the low low price of $179... 

Think about that for a moment, that's almost $200 for a single game, that is verging on half the price of the hardware to play the game on. Not to mention it's a throwaway game that will be forgotten in a couple more months... 

Now we wait to see what they'll do with Starwars Battlefront and how many editions they'll throw down our throats with their DLCS and battlepacks and other cash grabs.

If this is the future of gaming then I'm out... Seriously... I'll stick to buying games one year or more after release when the "complete" edition comes out and is cheap. But again if they're multiplayer games then the community will be dead by that point as  they'll all have jumped ship onto the next big cash grab.

 The obvious answer is that the three shells are touch / pressure sensitive buttons that perform specific functions:

 [I took down the flaming trio in under 2 mins](https://youtu.be/GC_-DhNkpcI) 




 What is this from? 




 And now I know why they were saying the new GH was going to be a platform rather than a series of new games.

Removing graphics in the traditional sense, like the old games had and using live footage / music videos the game itself will never age.  Distributing the content/songs online... it will never run out of content.

Basically they've taken SingStar and thrown GH into the mix... Which is what GH should have been from the start.

If the starting price and content / songs are at a reasonable price point then I'm all in. 




 I alternated between learning [Hey Jude](https://www.harptabs.com/song.php?ID=55) and [Blowing in the wind](https://www.harptabs.com/song.php?ID=164)... practicing one song over and over got maddening so I had to mix it up.

 The answer to this is also in the article:
Occupational Segregation

What causes the discrepancy in workplace deaths? The main cause is occupational segregation  the tendency for some jobs to be mostly held by men, and others to be mostly held by women. The most hazardous jobs  whether due to exposure to dangerous substances, or to risk of falling or being in a highway accident  are disproportionately held by men. (Contrary to popular belief, people in risky jobs are not usually paid extra to compensate them for danger).

Occupation segregation, in turn, is caused in part by workplace discrimination, both in the form of employers preferring a particular sex, and in the form of on-the-job harassment and discrimination making blue-collar women, or a pink collar men, know that theyre unwelcome.

Occupational segregation is also caused by self-segregation, as many male workers feel uncomfortable applying for female-dominated jobs, and vice versa. There is, in my opinion, a vicious cycle functioning; the lack of pink-collar male, and blue-collar female, role models and mentors makes it less likely that future workers will cross the occupational gender line.

 You'll need to add your friends again on the new PSN ID, the trophies will be separate... but thats the price you pay I guess.

The other option is to set your "Real Name" as the ID you want to use and then show your "Real Name" instead of your PSN ID.

Edit: For instance, my PSN is DukeDuG... but I have my "Real Name" set as train_subject3330... For the same reason as you, I chose the PSN ID years ago and we cant change it... Being able to display and change your "Real Name" whenever you want helps. 




 Set your current PSN ID with PS+ as the primary on your PS4.

Create a new PSN ID you wish to use, forget about your old one.

You now have a new PSN ID and you will retain access to online functions and all your old PSN IDs games.

Simple.

 Reminds me of Primal Rage for some reason. 
























 Moon landing? Please, at this point in technology we can clearly see that the moon is a hologram and that is obviously an overlay to cover an ancient satellite set in place by the Reptoids before they went into slumber. If you were to call it anything it was a docking mission to explore and attempt to reactive the satellites defensive / offensive capabilities...

As for that explosion... Yes it was an explosion, but it was not directed at the members of Parliament. He knows this, he's part of the very Reptoid collaborating society that set the plan in motion, you can tell by his general demeanor that he and the rest are in no danger and that it's all going as planned. 

The truth is that the explosive was planted in a large underground chamber located underneath Parliament in an obvious attempt to disturb / awaken the Reptoids from their slumber. 

The end game is to find the Reptoids with the knowledge to reactivate the satellite, so far no nation has been able to do so and the Reptoids they have awoken are starting to acclimate themselves into the world which we created... They have since worked their way into all positions of power and have been the ones behind all the conflicts in recent times... 

Now, my theory is that soon they will have no need for their worshipers like the politician in this video, soon they will be able to reactivate the satellite not for it's offensive or defensive capabilities like us mere humans want... They want it in order to send out a sub space transmission to recall their lost fleets in deep space.  




 According to OP you are a 432 month year old. 




 In the 3rd one you can change the control scheme to strafe. Makes the game way more enjoyable / easier to run and gun.

 If you're actually interested in a discussion it really is a matter of you get what you pay for when it comes to projectors and depends on how much your willing to spend, If you spend $3500 or more you'll be fine really.

Anything less... $500 - $1500 Well, it'll work sure, but you'll encounter issues as you've mentioned, washed out colours, blurred or distorted image if the projector isn't perfectly aligned, Issues focusing the lens etc.

Keep in mind anything around the $3500 mark is still considered an entry level home theater projector. Not without their faults sure, but you'd be hard pressed to find any real issues other than black levels, which are always an issue with projectors but can be mitigated with the correct screen type and colour to suit your projector and room lighting conditions.

If you just want a big screen and dont care about quality, get a cheap $500 - $1500 projector, use a sheet for a screen and set it up where ever you can.

Or spend a bit more money, buy a better projector along with a proper screen and set up a dedicated room for a home theater. 

But if you were just making a negative comment... Then eh, leave it at that.

 After re-watching the Pokemon series I have come to the conclusion that all the Pokemon games are not real events and are Games/simulations created by the Pokmon Technical Institute in the Pokemon Animated Universe itself.

In the episode: Se01-Ep09 - The School of Hard Knocks. The Students refer to Pokemons Lvls, experience, and when/how they will evolve based on this information, same as the game. 
As far as I remember they never mention Pokemon in this manner ever again except in the games themselves.

The episode then shows the Pokemon Battle Simulator, which is an almost exact replica of the actual Pokemon games battle system.

So my theory is that in the Pokemon Animated Universe the Pokemon Technical Institute created the games based on their research to help up and coming trainers and teach them about pokemon as well as threats in their world. (Team Rocket etc)

This is also supported by the 4th wall comments in some of the games from the Dev team. such as:
"I'm the game designer!"
"I wrote the story!"
"I'm the graphic artist! I drew you!" or "I'm the graphic designer! I'm a skilled dot artist!"
"Me? I'm the programmer!".

Also of note is that in some versions of the Pokemon Games there are NPCs playing Pokemon on a handheld device, meaning in the Pokemon Game Universe the Pokemon Games exist and is aware that it is indeed a game.

None of it is real, it's all a game within the Pokemon Animated Universe itself.

Or something...

 Nah back then people complained all the same, only difference is they had to write an actual letter and send it via post to the networks etc... Have you ever been so upset or offended you'd take time out of your day to do that? Hand write a letter then leave your house to go post it? That's commitment to your cause son.

These days any moron can jump online and complain via email, or facebook, twitter, forums etc.

TL;DR

People bitched then as much as now, it just took more effort to be heard. 




 Dont get me wrong, it's a good cause and I'm all for it, it's just that there might be better subs to post this, or not I dont know.

 Once a year in Melbourne Australia there is whats known as Hard Rubbish Collection / Verge side collection, where everyone takes what they dont want and throws it out the front of their house to be collected by the local council...

And I tell ya what man, you can get some really good stuff if you pick the right suburbs.

People throw out stuff like large flat screen TV's because they have a damaged power cable or a scratch in the corner of the screen.. Computers, Consoles, CD collections, Bicycles, Washers, Dryers, Desks, Tables, Couches...

People are known to take vans / pickups around to go scouting for good loot.. So you have to get in early. Theres also people who go around cutting all the cables off electronics for the scrap copper... bastards really.

You can damn near re-furnish you house if you're lucky enough.

So he's either asking for them for the sake of doing it or he's building a portfolio of other peoples work in hopes of starting a restoration / colourization business and using reddit as his workforce.

I hope it's the former and he simply wants AUS/NZ to live on in colour.

Light green is the Savanna

Yellow is pride rock / gorge

Purple is the Elephant graveyard

Blue are the nighttime scenes

Variations of Green is jungle

And of course the Orange and Red at the end there is the climatic ending with Pride Rock on fire...

The others.. never really watched them as much as the Lion King so I found them harder to follow like this.

 Yeah people frame Vinyls all the time so I figured why not do the same with Laserdiscs. They are about the same size and you get some awesome cover art. 

Only problem is they are getting harder to find at reasonable prices, especially well known / sought after movies.

 So... Nothing? 




 The person who "made" this did nothing other than generate a world in Minecraft and throw it on a USB. 

After that he sold the idea of the particular world created by the seed could only be played by one person as it's on a USB stick. If you want to play that particular world yourself... you need that USB stick. A good idea in itself but hardly worthy of a game design award.

Again, he did nothing, he did not create a game, he did not code anything, he merely generated a world in Minecraft using "Chain World" as the seed.

I like the idea though, if passed around each new player would shape that particular world. But in the end thats the same as playing online and limiting the server to one player at a time. 




 Is it an Asylum production? Sounds like an Asylum production... 




 Even if you go by the Movie Man of Steel version of Superman he can still move faster than any human could ever react. He can still fire lasers from his freaken eyes powerful enough to cut through buildings etc as well as damaging Kryptonian Amour.

Hell, in the trailer for BvS he's shown ripping the Batmobile apart with little effort. He could do the very same to Bats new armour if he wanted to without much effort.

If Sups wanted Batman dead he would be dead before Bats even reached for the Kryptonite. 




 Game: Haunting - Starring Polterguy

Platform: Mega Drive (Genesis for you 'Muricans)

Reason for rage quit: It was an awesome game, original and quirky, scaring rich folk out of their homes with humorous haunting tricks. Then you reach the last boss which is unlike the rest of the game and damn hard too. I could never beat him. It's just a stupid blob thing that later splits into multiple blob things... But if they touch you it drains 3/4 of your health... I tried so many times till I just placed the cartridge in it's case and forgot about it.

I'm almost tempted to download the ROM just to prove I can beat it as an adult...  




 No. You really don't. 




 Some say he's still in the 5th grade this very day... 




 No he won because Sups held back, like majorly, out of respect he didnt want to hurt or kill him. Where as Bats went all out giving everything he had.

Superman can move faster than Bats can even perceive let alone react against, he can rip through solid metal like butter for fucks sake.

Without plot armour Bats is a joke, just a rich fuck in a suit that would get destroyed by one hit from any metahuman.

If Sups wanted Batman dead he would be dead. No questions.
 




 Best role he's ever done was Les Grossman in Tropic Thunder.

Seeing him in that movie made me wish he'd take more risks... He's a good actor when he's not phoning it in. 




 I think EB near me has a bargin bin with like 3 Vita games in it... That counts as a display right?

 The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness

 Hey all, 

Thought I'd post here and see if anyone is interested, there a few part time/casual customer service positions available with Publicis Loyalty - Domestic and General call center.

It's a basic customer service role, all inbound, you'd be taking extended warranty claims for faulty products as well as follow up calls on existing claims. 

It's pretty much an immediate start with 2 weeks paid training.

If you're interested PM me and I'll send you the contact email address / phone number for HR.

Only available for the next hour or so, after that they're going to start taking applications through seek etc.

Edit: Whoa, an overwhelming number of interest, I think I cant take any more CVs from this point.
For those who have email their CV already I have passed them on and I hope HR will contact you shortly, if they do not I apologize in advance, there are limited positions available. 




 Nope, near the end he states very clearly what his intentions were from the start:

Hans: As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I knew I'd have to marry into the throne somewhere.

Hans: As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course, but no one was getting anywhere with her. But you...

Hans: You were so desperate for love, you were willing to marry me, just like that. I figured, after we married, I'd have to stage a little accident for Elsa.

He played nice, did what was required, only because he was not sure if his position was secured yet.

At the end when Anna is near death, Elsa is seen as a monster and sentenced to death there is no need for the charade any more.

That's pretty cut and dry, there is no need to try to explain it any further, no magic or meddling required. Hans was a dick. Simple.

 [Even Dwarfs started small.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065436/)
The inhabitants of an institution in a remote country rebel against their keepers. Their acts of rebellion are by turns humorous, boring and alarming. An allegory on the problematic nature of fully liberating the human spirit, as both commendable and disturbing elements of our nature come forward. The film shows how justifiable revolt may be empowering, but may also turn to chaos and depravity. The allegory is developed in part by the fact that the film is cast entirely with dwarfs.
