But note, rhesus monkeys have never passed the mirror test before. The study is interesting because these monkeys, which do not intrinsically understand mirrors, could *learn* to use them.

If mirror recognition can be taught, perhaps therapy can help these people in the future.

 Robert Seyfarth, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and pioneer in the fields of animal behavior and learning, wrote in an e-mail. This is the first time that a professional linguist has tackled the data on call combinations in wild monkeys.

So at least from a research standpoint, it means that we may want to start examining animal calls through the lens of linguistics. That's a sort of revolutionary idea, since we tend to think of animals noises as "calls", rather than a language or a dialect with logic-based rules. It's an interesting new avenue for research.

 WELL...the DoE lightbulb thing and the EXIM ban were honestly a bit draconian. It's one thing to charge companies extra for choosing the less environmentally friendly option, or to add taxes or incentives. But these were outright bans on investing in incandescent lightbulbs and coal-fired power plants. And the DoT light rail thing just shuts down current projects (the same senators who pushed for that rider are also working on new light rail projects as we speak).

 Even small farmers are notoriously bad for the environment. They all need to make money, especially the small ones, and so they often let their cash crops mess up normal crop cycles.

 It made the farmers pretty happy. It's strange, you usually think of farmers as being lovers of the land and pro-Earth etc...and then you take a look at the politics of it all, and notice that farmers are usually the ones pushing hardest against climate and land protection. Strange times.

 Here's the abstract from the [original paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103515002079)
"Relatively recent cometary impacts at the Moon could leave unique traces of their origins: high impact velocities and volatile abundances, combined with the presence of a dust- and ice-laden coma, may thermally and mechanically process the lunar surface in ways distinct from the impact of an asteroid. Here we analytically and numerically assess the consequences of a cometary impact at the Moon by considering the combined effects of a collision by the nucleus and inner coma. Our results show that cometary impacts entrain the finest fraction of lunar soil grains (10 m) over regional scales (1001000 km), produce large masses of vaporized material, and likely generate transient magnetic fields that could exceed the Earths surface field strength by a factor of 104. This combination of processes is consistent with a mechanism to generate lunar swirls: the diffuse, meandering disturbances in brightness and regolith texture that curl across much of the lunar far-side and are also commonly (but not exclusively) associated with magnetic anomalies. Previous observations of swirl features indicate that bright regions also possess a peculiar, altered regolith structure, which can be produced by the removal of fine soil grains. Regional scouring by an impacting comet explains both the structure and albedo variations: large dynamic pressures entrain the smallest grains within a near-surface flow of dusty plasma, disrupting the backscattering, fairy-castle structure of lunar soils in equilibrium with the airless environment. The resulting surface is brightened by compaction of the previously open, porous macrostructure. Darker lanes observed within swirl regions are interpreted as possible melt and/or vapor deposits. Finally, the intense magnetic fields generated during high-speed cometary impacts provide an explanation for correlations between swirl locations and magnetic anomalies."

 ...and they've believed no studies since then. I'm not optimistic either. 




 Here's the [original study](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2275444) published today in JAMA. Excerpt:
"A retrospective cohort study using an administrative claims database associated with a large commercial health plan. Participants included children continuously enrolled in the health plan from birth to at least 5 years of age during 2001-2012 who also had an older sibling continuously enrolled for at least 6 months between 1997 and 2012...In this large sample of privately insured children with older siblings, receipt of the MMR vaccine was not associated with increased risk of ASD, regardless of whether older siblings had ASD. These findings indicate no harmful association between MMR vaccine receipt and ASD even among children already at higher risk for ASD."

"Case 1: An Amputation Cover-Up. The Treatment: A new stem cell therapy that promises to restore blood flow in damaged legs. The Claim: All 26 patients in the study reported no significant clinical changes in either of their legs, beyond those caused by the stem cell treatment. The Fraud: FDA documents show that one of the patients had an entire foot amputated two weeks into the study. Thats a pretty serious omission, and it definitely constitutes a significant clinical change in the leg. No one bothered to correct or retract the faulty study, and the trial was considered a success.

 Sort of. But not entirely.  
Our results demonstrate that the GNSS and INS navigational sensors built into consumer devices such as smartphones are capable of detecting surface displacements from moderate and larger earthquakes.

...what we generally call "cell phone GPS" is really a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS...one type GNSS is GPS) plus Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). So the thing that most people think of as "GPS" include INS. In your cell phone, INS gets its position and velocity from the GPS satellite receiver and then calculates its own position based on motion sensors.


TL;DR: "Smartphone GPS"= GPS + INS.  




 Here's the abstract from the [original study](http://www.vocativ.com/culture/science/early-earthquake-warnings-smartphones-gps/):
Earthquake early warning (EEW) can reduce harm to people and infrastructure from earthquakes and tsunamis, but it has not been implemented in most high earthquake-risk regions because of prohibitive cost. Common consumer devices such as smartphones contain low-cost versions of the sensors used in EEW. Although less accurate than scientific-grade instruments, these sensors are globally ubiquitous. Through controlled tests of consumer devices, simulation of an Mw (moment magnitude) 7 earthquake on Californias Hayward fault, and real data from the Mw 9 Tohoku-oki earthquake, we demonstrate that EEW could be achieved via crowdsourcing.

 Ha! That explains my altruism...but does it explain my autonomic nervous system?  




 Here's the abstract from the [original study](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nn.4035.html):
"Independent evidence associates -amyloid pathology with both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep disruption and memory impairment in older adults. However, whether the influence of -amyloid pathology on hippocampus-dependent memory is, in part, driven by impairments of NREM slow wave activity (SWA) and associated overnight memory consolidation is unknown. Here we show that -amyloid burden in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) correlates significantly with the severity of impairment in NREM SWA generation. Moreover, reduced NREM SWA generation was further associated with impaired overnight memory consolidation and impoverished hippocampal-neocortical memory transformation. Furthermore, structural equation models revealed that the association between mPFC -amyloid pathology and impaired hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation was not direct, but instead statistically depended on the intermediary factor of diminished NREM SWA. By linking -amyloid pathology with impaired NREM SWA, these data implicate sleep disruption as a mechanistic pathway through which -amyloid pathology may contribute to hippocampus-dependent cognitive decline in the elderly."

 Well, I don't think US should *support* them. I just don't think US should be trying so hard to stop them. Seems likely ISIS will lose anyway. Worst case scenario, ISIS wins and wipes out the Syrian government, the Iranian government and a few terrorist groups. As for the civilians, they're utterly screwed under both the status quo and ISIS, so we're not doing them any favors either. 




 right, so those are bad things. But, like, everyone they're at war with is equally bad, and a bunch are actually kind of worse.  




 I think the USA should join Team ISIS.

Think about it. ISIS is trying to overthrow the Syrian government (that would be Bashar al-Assad's government, the one that used chemical weapons on its civilians). Meanwhile, ISIS is also at war with: Iran (the ones with the rogue nukes), Hezbollah (the ones with the rogue rocket strikes) and basically every failed state and terrorist organization in the region. Why are we trying to stop them?

 Here's an abstract from [the full study:](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150609/ncomms8352/full/ncomms8352.html)
Exceptionally preserved organic remains are known throughout the vertebrate fossil record, and recently, evidence has emerged that such soft tissue might contain original components. We examined samples from eight Cretaceous dinosaur bones using nano-analytical techniques; the bones are not exceptionally preserved and show no external indication of soft tissue. In one sample, we observe structures consistent with endogenous collagen fibre remains displaying ~67nm banding, indicating the possible preservation of the original quaternary structure. Using ToF-SIMS, we identify amino-acid fragments typical of collagen fibrils. Furthermore, we observe structures consistent with putative erythrocyte remains that exhibit mass spectra similar to emu whole blood. Using advanced material characterization approaches, we find that these putative biological structures can be well preserved over geological timescales, and their preservation is more common than previously thought. The preservation of protein over geological timescales offers the opportunity to investigate relationships, physiology and behaviour of long extinct animals.

 Obligatory: this happened just now and I'm still wallowing in shame, but not badly enough to wait until it wears off to write a post

I keep a bunch of dinosaur toys on my desk at work. There's a triceratops and a stegosaurus. I expect every intelligent person to know the difference between the two but, just in case you don't [here's a handy explanation](http://dinosaurs.findthedata.com/compare/255-278/Stegosaurus-vs-Triceratops). Right. So my desk-mate pointed to the triceratops this morning and asked if it was a stegosaurus. Rather than smacking him for not being a paleontologist, I gave a super dank explanation: 

"No," said I. "It's a tricerotops. Cuz it's got tri, three, ceras on its tops!". So witty. So cool. That's why I'm the king of the workplace.

Meanwhile, another coworker walked by. He said, hey, thats what my Dad used to say when he was describing tricerotops. Now, a social adept person would have heard the phrase what my Dad used to say and figured there might be more to the story. Not me. 

Hey!" said I. "Thats awesome. Your Dad is awesome. Lets invite him to the office! Why has he never been here before? Cant wait to meet your dad!! He rocks. 

My coworker just stared at me sadly and walked away. Turns out his Dad is dead, and the triceratops thing was a fond childhood memory, not an invitation to remind him of his loss. Oops.

TL;DR Invited coworkers dead father to the office. Ruined a happy childhood memory involving dinosaurs. Clarified stegosaurus vs triceratops once and for all.

 Here's the original study: http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms8346

Abstract:
"Evaporation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the natural environment and a dominant form of energy transfer in the Earths climate. Engineered systems rarely, if ever, use evaporation as a source of energy, despite myriad examples of such adaptations in the biological world. Here, we report evaporation-driven engines that can power common tasks like locomotion and electricity generation. These engines start and run autonomously when placed at airwater interfaces. They generate rotary and piston-like linear motion using specially designed, biologically based artificial muscles responsive to moisture fluctuations. Using these engines, we demonstrate an electricity generator that rests on water while harvesting its evaporation to power a light source, and a miniature car (weighing 0.1kg) that moves forward as the water in the car evaporates. Evaporation-driven engines may find applications in powering robotic systems, sensors, devices and machinery that function in the natural environment."

"Microscale soft-robots hold great promise as safe handlers of delicate micro-objects but their wider adoption requires micro-actuators with greater efficiency and ease-of-fabrication. Here we present an elastomeric microtube-based pneumatic actuator that can be extended into a microrobotic tentacle. We establish a new, direct peeling-based technique for building long and thin, highly deformable microtubes and a semi-analytical model for their shape-engineering. Using them in combination, we amplify the microtubes pneumatically-driven bending into multi-turn inward spiraling. The resulting micro-tentacle exhibit spiraling with the final radius as small as ~185 m and grabbing force of ~0.78 mN, rendering itself ideal for non-damaging manipulation of soft, fragile micro-objects. This spiraling tentacle-based grabbing modality, the direct peeling-enabled elastomeric microtube fabrication technique, and the concept of microtube shape-engineering are all unprecedented and will enrich the field of soft-robotics."

 Incidentally, all of those Talmudic cases also have very practical, law-based applications. For instance, the section on breast size is trying to determine at what age a woman is considered an adult for the purpose of court prosecution, especially in capital cases. 

In the US, once you're 18 you are an adultregardless of your personal development. Even though we know some 15 year olds can consent to sex and make their own decisions, we call them children. And even though we know some 20 year olds can barely consent and are easily swayed by peer-pressure, we consider them adults. 

The Talmud tries to avoid these pitfalls by defining adulthood for the purposes of consent and prosecution by physical development...the onset of puberty...at which point, the Talmud needs to define puberty.

Fascinating...not ridiculous.
