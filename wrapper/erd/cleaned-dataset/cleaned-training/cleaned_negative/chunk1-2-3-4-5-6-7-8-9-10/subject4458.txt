 Whoa, that's like a day after my birthday.  Talk about an awesome birthday present. 




 Don't forget derping the derps

 "I'm a man too you know.  I go pee pee standing up!" 




 JAAAAYSUUUUN!! 




 So you're telling me that they just noticed the adopted part [in the wheatley arc?](/spoiler)  I'm sorry you parents are offended by the adopted part, but can I just say that they're a biiit slow? o_o  considering GLaDoS mentions it a bunch of times before 




 Welp, I am now mentally invigorated 
























 The reason they make noise is because invisibility. 




 I say just ask for spread sauce.  It's almost the same as animal style 




 SC2 Heart of the Swarm...And zerg gets the least amount of updates.
Well isn't that full of iron. 




 and that's just their apm 




 I like elevator music 




 it's back up guys. next game though. on shakuras plateau o_o 




 SO IT WASN'T JUST ME 




 You should be able to watch the stream through combatex's viewpoint somewhere on youtube. 4 parts 
























 Go to foreign country, wouldn't be considered foreign anymore 




 (9/10 btw, its the best portable KH to date)

You gotta go denouttaden 




 download the song and change the pitch in audacity :D

 Just replace the teddy bear with skyrim and you have a real life situation

 reddit + skyrim 
























 Ah, sorry.  I should've probably made the text bigger or put it in the title.  I put in that I preferred the game wasn't an FPS or a MOBA.  I agree with you fully though that those are pretty great games. 




   
**Preferably not FPS or a MOBA.**  
Also here are some games I already own and played with others:  
-Monaco   
-Trine 2   
-Hammerwatch 




 Role play 




 Stinky hat  




 "THAT'S A LOT OF NUTS " 




 a hammer 




 Voltar, just because he's a support doesn't mean he's not capable of handling himself. Especially late game.

Getting this for my cousin 




 Guillermo del totally okay with that? 
























 Also went to that high school.  The fact that Snoop used to go there is one thing I like to brag to my friends about.  
  
Fun fact: People usually don't give a damn when I mention it... 




 No plans of going there then?  




 I was hoping that everyone would be discouraged to go therefore less people will go. I can dream 




 Anyone around the San Jose best buy? As of now I know it hasn't started yet but let me know how the lines are 




 We can and I would encourage the community to form opinions.  The only thing is that we shouldn't be too critical of the product.  If anything it's another flavor of smash to play, not everyone's cup of tea but it's something.  And if nintendo is really pushing forth this whole ideal of bridging the smash community I would bet that patches are going to be a very prevalent part of this game.  




 Too lazy to make a Conker game, make it yourself. 




 How easy is it to pick up and play torchlight 1 for someone who doesn't have any experience with ARPGs  




 Sadly yes :/ 
























 I'm liking the new interface and all but Nintendo really needs to step up when it comes to naming their products. I bet there's going to be a good amount of disappointed children getting the regular 3ds model because of uninformed parents.  




 SHIRT RIPPAH 




 So Lucina is basically going to be Marth for beginners? 




 In regards to the other characters as alternate costumes, you might be mistaking sakurai with the PMBR team.  At least I don't remember sakurai stating that. 




 tanks you 




 But the thing is snow also agreed she looked familiar  




 The only complaint that I would have to make with this.  
[Spoiler](#s "Bigby mentions in his first meeting with Faith(which was before meeting Nerissa) was that he feels like she had a sense of familiarity to her.  Maybe the realization might be what you said but what irks me still is what was the connection of his initial familiarity with Faith")  
Correct me if I got anything wrong. 





























 Bless nintendo and wanting touch screens on their shit 3 




 because we're desperate and people take advantage of that 




 Help a Blind man out, NA code for a couple of steam games I'm willing to offer because I can't play cause I'm blind 




 I'm trading some steam games for NA demo code, pm me if interested in trade 




 codes? :D 




 ayyyyy lmao 




 Haha I guess that's what I'm trying to get at, what in the game is considered a projectile and what's not.  Also it says in the description for RBAY "Reflects **most** enemy projectiles during tornado" so I figured there were some exceptions.  I'll add the clarifications on my original post 




 EDIT: I guess what I'm trying to ask is what is considered a projectile in Awesomenauts and what's not, also in the description of RBAY it states  
Reflects **most** enemy projectiles during tornado 





























 I can see 




 3 




 offering some humble bundle games for NA code 




 3 op so nice 




 what would you like for you to give that code? 




 Because I'm becoming blind and would like to go blind with this demo 




 not exactly the best place to ask this question but no 30 time play limit...coming from someone who doesn't have a code 





























 I say just cover the game as a whole like what makes this particular smash different overall, make brief comparisons to other smash games it shares similarities to and maybe even game feel/speed/etc? I feel like you could do that for all iterations of smash games and give the newcomers who don't doesn't know the difference between each iteration a brief overview of what the composition of that particular smash game is. Not sure if I made sense there but hopefully you got the gist of it haha 




 I haven't done too much research but I feel like it is. I'm still interested in getting it since it looks impressive. Either that or transistor.

EDIT: guess there's way more to be excited about than I thought 




 binding of isaac for $1, the hd remake is coming out soon for about $15 preorder but if you're on a budget I strongly recommend. I believe if you preorder the remake while having a copy of the original you get 33% off the game so if you plan to buy both I guess you save like 4 dollars on the remake. 




 9 volt playable character 




 Just PMed you asking about details but I guess you're planning a small meet up. Just let me know time 




 I'm in c9 but I'm down as well. Just pm me 




 I'm not exactly sure if that title helps with identifying the model but I've tried opening up this laptop and I'm too scared to go any further.  Tried finding similar model tutorials online but nothing really comes close. Some help would be appreciated! 
























 Some background, she was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety back in April but only started taking the medication near the end of it. This was during school and we lived on campus so to keep her in check with her dosages she had a campus counselor and we saw results with the exceptions of a couple of episodes that happened circumstantially 

Now it's summer, I'm back in college for summer session while she's back at home with her parents. She quit the medication cold turkey after she was diagnosed with a viral infection and was afraid of mixing her antidepressants (Prozac i believe) and other stuff she was taking. After three weeks she went back on it after reading the consequences online but only a couple of days after that she would refuse to take it or even fib about having took it. I'm about 6 hours away so being there is out of the question. How should I go about this kind of situation? 




 Either I'm blind or no one posted this yet. But if you want a MOBA that's not click to move i wholeheartedly recommend Awesomenauts. Takes place in a 2d plane and plays like a platformer. Plugging in /r/Awesomenauts 




 I don't think I donated to their kickstarter when it came out, or at least not the early access tier.  But I'm still confused as to how I was able to get into the beta before 




 I have Starstorm bought and I also was able to get into previous betas but I can't seem to get into the new 2.11 beta.  Any fixes for this? 




 Preferably playable in mac and PC and f2p  games are also welcome. Was thinking about getting back into Ragnarok online private servers but I don't know how well that game holds up now. 




 It's been a while since I took 12B.  What are some good things to brush up on stuff before getting into CS 101?  Any resources I can use? 




 Pc 




 Updated but no change, what were the other anti virus software out there again? Or the one you'd recommend  




 I used to be able to connect to both with no problem but now my laptop won't connect to either one of them. I'm sure it's not a school issue since I'm connected on my phone. I'm capable of connecting to our apartment internet as well so I'm not sure what the problem is. Anyone else have this problem before? 




 That's it!! Thanks x] 




 So lets say you fail a class but within the enrollment period you sign up for a class in which the prerequisite was the class you failed.  Right now the portal shows the class to still be in my schedule, is that a glitch in the system? Would that class still be there when the next quarter rolls in? 




 I know there's a handful of videos that do comparisons but I can't seem to find this one in particular. Might have been /r/Unexpected as well 




 There's a mini flyer that I got for [crunchbutton.com](https://crunchbutton.com/food-delivery)  
supposedly we have more options for delivery which include McDonalds, Taco Bell and some other stuff.  I'm sure very few people tried this service since all the stores only have one available delivery date which is monday 9-6 or something like that.  How long was this a thing?  And if you're the few that ordered before how was that experience? 




 Becoming Ambidextrous  




 But I had capital letters on mine :/ 




 This is the end. I'm not a fan of Seth Rogen movies in general but man did that movie feel like the biggest circle jerk of stars culminating in one place and it didn't help that I didn't know most of them. It was the movie equivalent of an inside joke, if you're the crowd who doesn't get it you're gonna feel left out and that is not a good feeling to have
