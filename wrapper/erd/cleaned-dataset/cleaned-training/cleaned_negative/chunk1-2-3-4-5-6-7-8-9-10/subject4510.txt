 I live in VB... ;/ 




 I try to time my flush so when I finish peeing, it's right as the water flushes down. 




 Hasn't aged a day 




 But I don't want to be seas and stars, I just wanna live forever and with the way medicine and technology have been progressing.. 




 Best advice, pay the $400-500 and make sure you're protected. 




 Some of those people are the most successful. I felt bad for one family. The house was 100k under 3 other similar listings (exact model condominiums) and we went in uncertain about what was wrong with the unit.. NOTHING, it was the agent. It took a week to get a hold of the agent, he had 30 listings, the key didn't work, had to wait another week to get in, had to schedule around tenants through the tenants. When we ratified a contract on the place, the next day I received an email from a closing coordinator, never talked to the agent ever again. I thought to myself this is a family that is 100k under the next listing, probably extremely motivated, and they think what a horrible market. The same week, another condominium sold for 505k (the one we purchased was 320k) 




 My name gives away my profession. Biggest shock to me is the range of people in the business. You have very professional, intelligent, hardworking Realtors and you have some people who really don't give a shit. The surprising thing is some of these bad agents are really successful. I'm working a deal right now where I have the clients calling me on a nightly basis because they can't get a hold of their agent. We we're supposed to meet on Tuesday morning at 9:30 am and he just never showed, texted me at 11:30 am to tell me his daughter was sick.... more likely slept in. 

I hope I'll never be like this but I'm a relatively new agent so I treat all my clients like kings and queens right now! haha 




 I'm a Realtor with Rose and Womble. I just checked REIN (MLS search engine for Realtors) there's quite a few options out there (29 when I just searched). Shoot me a PM if you want. 




 My dad's birthday was on the 2nd, he passed away on his birthday a year ago. It sucks man but you just have to treasure the time you had with him. 




 Never too early to start talking but be ready for a lot of questions. They'll want to know zoning, any common facilities (water, sewage, etc) 

Don't put your eggs all in one basket. Try to get as many builders over there as possible. The more people you can get over there, the more panic you'll create amongst them. Depending on how sought after the area is. 

But it never hurts to get the ball rolling. Some builders will tell you to get back to them when it's ready, and you should. Others will want to start negotiating immediately and that's even better because you can use pending of the subdivision to give you time to evaluate all possible avenues you can take.  




 Haha picked up a new client today, it's coming along!!! Plus I'm at office now but I mean don't get me wrong I sneak a peak on reddit while I'm taking a poo  




 I'm a Realtor that works with a builder and we specifically look for homes that need to be torn down or empty lots. 




 You said it's appraised at around that value, what's that exact value?
 




 How long have you been on the market?
 




 No problem, if you have anymore questions you can contact me- just shoot me a PM. If your a self motivator you'll do great. I was the same way, at the office at 6 AM and even though I was in more of a foreman role, I was always helping whether running equipment or having a shovel in my hand. So when I came over here I immediately transitioned to being in the office everyday at 9:00 am and I can say that 2 of my clients came to me because nobody else was in the office and we had a walk in. One of which equated to my first exclusive sale, hence the birth of my post. Good luck 




 * He's right, each brokerage works differently. A lot of the Franchise brokerages will offer more up front percentage cuts but will be loaded with Franchise fees. An example is my friend works for a large franchise and her cut is 70% but every transaction has a 'regional fee' of 7% and another office fee of 2%. I chose a local firm that's number one in business in my area, the initial percentage is lower at 57% but I chose this firm for three reasons; I have family in the firm, your percentage increases stay with you for the life of your time with the firm, and there's nothing extra taken out. 

* On the second half of your comment, I love this career, but I love socializing and being around people. I worked for the bridge division of a construction company and was a project manager working 60 hours a week. I can promise you, I work way more in real estate. It's an extremely demanding job and it requires a lot of money up front (around $2500 with Realtor dues if you take that route) and that's not counting the probably 3 months it will take you to get leads turned to clients turned to sales/listings. I'm in my 6th month and I have 3 listings I'm splitting 50/50, 3 closings (2 exclusive, one 50/50), and a handful of leads I'm working on turning into clients. You have to keep working open houses to keep the leads flowing in. You have to work your ass off during the week to translate the leads to clients. I'm working 7 days a week but the old adage if you enjoy what you do, you won't feel like you're working. Well I love what I do and I don't mind the time. If you wanna know anymore information let me know. Sorry if some of this is incomprehensible, just had a minute and figured I'd shoot you a response!

* I forgot to mention, very successful Realtors can get up to 90% cuts. Doing around 5 million in transactions will get you 80-85% in my office, so it's nothing unobtainable. 




 No you're exactly right. My grandmother is a Realtor as well. She's extremely successful in the business and drives a brand new Buick Enclave with every feature (Bose, leather, navi etc) When I take clients out I use her vehicle but it's also awkward because I have people ask me if it's my vehicle. I've used every excuse under the sun, no- vehicles having breaks, oil, detailed, blah blah. A lot of times I have had no choice but to use the Ranger and I can tell a real difference in the body language of my clients or prospective clients. 




 Not to drag this out but I read that it may be better to go through a credit union instead of the dealership? And thank you for the response. 




 I have a few problems. I own (no money owed) a 2000 off road Ford Ranger with 149,000 miles. 

* I'm a new Realtor in Virginia and I've quickly realized I need a new vehicle. I've been a Realtor for 6 months and my truck has been giving me a lot of issues plus not being very friendly on gas.

* I have fairly bad credit, a job that includes no guaranteed pay, and rent/utilities that cost me around $950 a month. I have my first 6 months of rent paid off already (from a previous closing I split with another agent) I have the Ford Ranger to trade in/sell (my guess is 3-4k value) and I have around $12,000 cash. 

* I would really like to purchase a used car for 10-14k, in a perfect world I could trade in my Ranger and put another 2-3k down and then have the car financed for an extremely long period (72 months would be preferable) but with the option to pay it off whenever. This would protect me from running low on cash in an unpredictable career but also be able to pay a few thousand every time I had a closing. 

* Is this type of deal possible, would a car dealership be willing to work with me on something like this? 




 I'm in the Hampton Roads area but I'm on it! Stupid office duty right now. Being a broker, any good advice? CRM Referral Maker or any of that stuff work? Thank you 




 Norfolk Botanical Gardens is great. Another great spot (mind you in Virginia Beach) is Bayville Park.  




 Well to be fair, we're a smaller office. I think we did 20 sales/listings last month in an office of about 15 active agents. But I have noticed this month has started off slow.

..Well played Sue 




 I did not know this, why I post on here about real estate related stuff. So how could you get a master list of what's available in your area? A perfect example is a condo I know is foreclosed on in a condominium I have a listing. 




 That's awesome, I remember when I was at PA. I would be at a football game and all of a sudden the rumor was PHARELL IS COMING IN A HELICOPTER AT HALF TIME!!! 4 years of this kind of stuff, never saw him once! Glad to see him back. 




 I'm not trying to deter you. I can't see the house and it may make sense. The only thing I would say beware of, is I work with a group of builders that typically tear down but occasionally flip homes as well. So I've seen a lot of older homes that have had this process done and they try so hard to make an extra room and it just looks terribly tacky/off. One room was divided and it made both rooms look like walk in closets. I've also seen rooms created that didn't make floor plan sense, bedroom between living room and kitchen. That probably doesn't apply to your loft but just my two cents.  




 This really isn't much help but if Bank of America owns the property, it should be listed on various listing services (MLS, Realtor.com, Zillow, Trulia etc) 

I'm clearly biased but I would look for a Realtor that specializes in REO's and have them look into it for you. The listing side pays commission so it wouldn't cost you anything. 




 AND YOU RANKED CHESAPEAKE THE THIRD MOST BORING CITY, HOW DARE YOU! 




 Realtor from Va here, I would never recommend anybody to use Quicken Loans. Typically if you have a local loan officer it's much more personal. After pre-qualification, communication is the most critical part. 


Good luck though,  I know it's got to be tough bouncing place to place. 




 Looks like a good time, I missed Harbor Fest this year.  




 Moobs is completely correct. I'm a Realtor in Virginia Beach. It's strange he did not disclose to you the difference between unrepresented and represented parties. Basically this protects the broker/agent from doing all the work and then you deciding to purchase without a broker/agent. If you like the Realtor and think he will do a good job, I would sign the sheet. But I would definitely demand he fill in the sheet first and walk you through the differences of being a customer or a client.

 I'm relatively new to investing as a whole. So far in investing I put $1000 in GTAT at 16.50 and when it dropped to 13.90, I put another $1000 in. 

I know it's a big risk and honestly I don't really care. Not that I don't care about money but I'm 28 and I'm not tied up to any large financial burden. I would like to put $500 to $1,000 in a handful of penny stocks but not for day trading. I really would like to put my money in some up and coming companies.

I've been looking at a few weed stocks such as NGMC but also curious if weed does become nationally legalized if someone like Phillip Morris would just consume that market and change it's business model. 

Always curious about future tech companies; 3D printing, graphene, etc. 


- Penny stocks for long term investments? Speculative penny stocks with a real chance for a future?

 I know..., there is a billion books on real estate. I'm a young Realtor and I'm trying to perfect my descriptions of properties. Double cove crown molding, built-in buffet, picture frame wainscoting. Is there a book that would have visual descriptions of home features. 




 Somehow this kept slipping under the radar for me. I received the book for Christmas and then lost it. Was cleaning out my grandfathers car and found it in there and just started reading it last night.... and I found five dollars.

 CRISS CROSS 




 My listing package is a video virtual your ($200), Home Warranty Supplied for buyer ($400), agreement to have the house open every Saturday/Sunday for the first 6 weeks and I never use a lock box . If an agent wants to show the property I'm always present because who knows the house better, the listing agent or an agent that's never been inside. With that said I never negotiate commission and a lot of Realtors list for 1-2% and never do anything. Really get what you pay for. 




 That's like 2-3 days ago on Shore Drive we had a helicopter, multiple boats, and 2 cruisers parked on the Lesner. I was listening on the police scanner from my place and they were looking for a kiteboarder until it was too dark to continue the search. My girlfriend works for WTKR and I asked her and she never heard anything and I never saw anything mentioning the search.  




 Complete stock newb so be gentle but when I look this stock up I can't find it. 




 Great post for a newbie like myself. Question... If I still purchased $1000 when it was .10 and I sold it at $20.00 and I was an unknowing purchaser. Could I technically sell and walk away making a huge profit? Or because they are bouncing back and forth would it make it difficult for me to sell? 




 Thats rouggggh!
 




 I just wish on Monday I put my life savings into CYNK and on Thursday I sold it all off, my weekend would have been delightful

 I just put a $1000 into GTAT, any other company stocks to look out for?  




 Where in Va just out of curiousity?  




 I've put it down for clients before. As mentioned the preparation is everything. I spent 2 days cleaning (intense cleaning, acid etching to pull up the protective layer put on it) but actually putting the epoxy down only only took me a few hours (2 car garage). If you're interested I'll post some pictures of the finished product. We matched the shudders and people loved it. The house sold in 5 weeks, I'm not going to say that's why but it definitely helped the home show well.

next up... how to post imgur photos correctly lol 




 I think your pops looks like a hippie Brad Pitt 




 I hope this is the correct place. I'm a Realtor ... in Virginia as my name has given away. I've noticed a few photos, including one we have at our disposal, can be used on flyers and websites where only the picture is shown. No background or blank space so if you place a different colored background, there is not a square or block. The one example I have is we have a company logo with a .png format that can be placed on anything and it's only the Logo, no block or white background. What exactly is this called? And can you do it with a mac with basic software, no photoshop etc.? I would really like to do it with my headshot and some additional logos (Realtor logo etc.)

I'm sorry for my lack of knowledge and probably terrible description but any help would be welcome. Also is there any companies that do ? 

Thank you 




 Wow... good sir, you have made my day

 You should never negotiate for repairs to be done after a closing. It's always wise to have the repairs re-inspected by a professional after repairs are made, thought I won't lie, I don't always recommend that if it's only a few hundred dollars of repairs.

 I'm 28, much too old for this kind of imagination. But when I saw this today and kept picturing Foley still alive next to this coward. I wish I could have just teleported there, as this dirtball spoke into his 3rd world GoPro, with a machine gun, and spray that sick bastard down.  




 Only thing that worries me about NTEK. I feel like eventually the native 4k will be built within the TV's

 I know this is purely speculation but I'm just curious, what do you think will be the ceiling of the GTAT stock if Apple released that the sapphire will be used on ALL iPhones and the upcoming iWatch.

Once again I know it's speculation but curious peoples responses that are much wiser then me.  




 Oh.... oh yes!  




 Well now I can sit in silence and feel like a real Einstein, thank you.

I think that this was the first episode that really made me enjoy the story as a whole. Before this episode, even though it felt like some of the story lines were coming together, they still felt mostly frayed.  




 I could go on for hours about the death of Gladys. My girlfriend doesn't get home for an hour, and I'm just sitting in silence mind fucked. 

Why did they kill Gladys? Did they really kill Gladys? What does it say about Gladys that she was begging for her life during the stoning? Did Gladys death really do that much good? Wtf is Patti saying 99% of the time? Why was it so important for her to die? Why did Kevin have to understand THAT way?  WHY, WHY, WHY!?! 




 OMG.. The glass?!? The neck?!? But in the end... I still have no idea what I'm watching and I will be back next Sunday. 




 I definitely will update this post if anyone is interested. I put another $2,000 into GTAT on Thursday. I have 2 closings this upcoming week but hopefully after I get through the craziness I can continue studying investments and invest a few more thousand.  




 Purchased and received today. Not exactly what I was looking for but will definitely be a great starting place. I'll read this first.  
























 Well I've checked out SotA, my problem is with the PvP. I was big into mage PvP. I loved how you could literally have 70 key commands and if you really worked at it, you could beat 10v1. I don't see that with SotA. I also don't like the camera angle which appears less conducive to that sort of gameplay. 

Guild Wars seems to really get the closest as to what I would want a "new" UO to look like. But instead of a zoom, scrolled out and above. But the open world aspect of a pre-Trammel UO is not in Guild Wars DNA. UO was fun whether you we're a PKer or a Hunter/Miner/Gatherer etc because of the fear of being outside of the walls of the city. And while the guards could basically insta-hit you, it was a lot more engaging then what a lot of games do by creating "PvP zones" where you have to enter load areas etc. 

I wish I had a billion dollars to produce my own hardcore game that was more about a world with realistic boundaries and magic/fantasy sprinkled on top than a whole world that just constantly reminds you it's phony *sighs* 




 Could this be a sign that EA may be working with Garriott to bring SoTA into UO2. I know it's much later now but months ago I remember him answering that question with yes, it wouldn't be difficult to take what he had and create a UO2 if EA was willing to give all control the Richard.  




 6 weeks ago my baseball fantasy team was ranked number 6 and I probably wasn't even going to make the playoffs (only 4 teams get in) I added Jeter, haven't lost a game since and I'm winning the championship game by 150 points.  




 Thank you 




 Mmmm well then offer 3000, who cares, lol 

As long as there is no offers and they are willing to counter, it can't hurt to try to get it at a lower price. 




 Regardless what you do, if it's a fire sale it will be gone quickly so just get an offer in and receive a counter. 




 Best day ever. 




 Also her disappearance is similar to 5-6 other missing people in the last few years.  




 It started off as a joke but I picked up Derek Jeter. He is absolutely crushing the ball in the last week. I guess pitchers are just throwing fast balls down the cock for him. Should I start him this week? He's facing a lot of less than stellar pitchers.  




 I was at a recreational baseball park where I had a game later that day when I was around 13, this girl was hovering over my shoulder and when I looked at her she told me I had really clean ears.... about 10 minutes later one of her friends handed me her number.  




 I know it's in the game but I'm looking for a controller layout for the xbox one in the PDF or text layout that I can print... I'm tired of going back and forth.

Does anyone have a link? Thank you 




 I would love if you had a site like that as well. I'm in the process of remodeling a bathroom and it would be great to see all the issues that are ahead of me.  




 I personally roll the dice on Tanaka. The Yankees aren't theoretically out of it so they'll definitely want the win. Will he throw a CG, 100% no way but I think he has the opportunity to throw 6. 




 As defending champion, ordinary citizens (my friends) begged for me to lose. As I barely made it into the playoffs (didn't make playoffs until last week) people didn't take me serious. Now as I close on my opponent (#1 seed, which was 21-2) and prepare for the championship, I ask ... What should I do with my starting rotation. This is a head to head matchup and it involves total points, not winning categories. 

My playoff bullpen:

 I'm personally making a big bet on this stock. I feel like it's near the bottom and I have moved all stock money into just GTAT. I'm also in no need for that money and plan to be waiting for quite some time. (6 months - 1 year) 




 Title says it all, on Fox Fantasy it shows as yes but reading a few sites says otherwise. 




 SAMESIES!!
 




 How they started on Tuesday, 5 days later = Sunday? And all games all week, no days off 









 Why did they push back his next start until the Cardinals? He was one of my double-starters this week, wtf. 




 wow 




 I'm in first round playoff, guy I'm playing had Cashner and was sending me shit talking text messages all Tuesday. Haven't heard from him since around the 6th inning of Arrietas CG 




 Mannnnnnnnnnnn I hope that's the case because I'll need all the help I can get.  




 I lost McHugh last night too, hopefully he still pitches Saturday or Sunday.  




 I dominated but it just happened to be my opponent had TRUMBO AND CASHNER.. *begins to weep* 




 Honestly.. I live near Oceana and we get this on the daily. I guess I'm spoiled but video was eh 




 Damnit, he's a double starter for me. First round of playoffs. 




 All I saw was McHugh was pulled for injury delay, WHAT HAPPENED!?!?  




 I would make a badass video game that's pretty much pre-aos ultima online but a lot cooler.

 That's all a shame, not sure why this question got down voted but Ive been itching to take a little bit and was thinking about either a free share or back to UO (more for the relationships then for the new style of play) but have also been checking in on SOA every month or so. Considered putting some money into the startup but I just don't see too much I like as of now.

 You gotta lay the 'D' before the 'D' gets laid on you.  




 I've looked at PvP videos and it clearly doesn't look anything like Pvp on UO. Just to save the comment, "you know why... it's not UO!" I get that but anybody who has had early access, what is the PvP like? Is this a game I should get behind? 




 I had around $1,800 in GTAT on Friday, I have about $180 today. I upvoted. 




 Ah nice well hopefully somebody will purchase GTAT and the stocks I have in right now will be worth something but everything indicates it won't be. 




 Nice where in VA? I live in Va Beach. 




 I left work around 1 PM. My gf works for the local news so she doesn't go in until 3. Immediately came in and just went to pound town. She left. I made some bacon. Laid in bed most the day with the itis. Met some clients at 6:00, came home around 7:15, got in some sweats, cooked some more bacon, now I'm awaiting the football game. 




 Well as a new person involved in stocks I learned a valuable lesson today. Luckily considering I'm new and rather young I only had about $2,000 in stocks, I said luckily because I'm reading on message boards of people losing 80-150k. I guess I just sit on my stocks and hope some way in hell I get something out of it? *sighs* A big lesson in life today.

 I agree about the watch. Do I think it was overhyped? Absolutely but I do think we'll eventually stabilize around $15-16 and by then I'm hoping the rumor mill will pick up again with the iPhone 6S. The news now? A lot of speculating is going on but the two big ones; the original quarter reports we're correct and the profits they showed won't be altered with the absence of the iPhone, there is some sort of partnership with the upcoming Tesla announcement. (I don't really see this one but just saying what I've been seeing)

 Been dropping, dropping dropping, and I've been buying it up every dollar or so but it just sky rocketed back up to around $11.20, what in the hell is going on? 

Are we guaranteed good news next week? 




 That's so awesome you haven't had any complications. Prayers for you from Virginia! 




 I was just thinking of a realistic standpoint. The game isn't worth $14 month but they have to earn money. If they did it similar to transfer tokens etc. it would be interesting. Atleast bring more life to the game. I think they couldn't exploit UO as EA enjoys to do because they would be competing against 3rd party resource and skill trainer services. Just my 2 cents, didn't expect to be down voted back to Deceit dungeon.  




 I think everybody has a tough time deciding a "perfect era" but I think a pre-trammel period of any sort would peak a lot of interest. 




 As easy as it is for skill gain, I think UO should consider free to play model now. The game is so dated, add skills like $25-50 to 120 a skill etc. 

This way people could jump in rather easily. I know I would have an account to at least BS on and log on occasionally to see what's going on. They might not make a ton of money off me but that would at least be one more person logging in that hasn't for years now.

 I enjoy PC gaming and spent over $2,000 for my gaming desktop. I sold my desktop because I rarely use it. I like the fact that all my required work is on my MacBook Pro for work. I would 100% be one of the people purchasing an external graphics card solution so I could just switch to Windows and game and switch back for work.  




 Same. I'm annoyed at the cost of the Sonnett Echo Express III, I want to do this with my MacBook Pro 




 thanks! 




 Is there a forum or place to join a keeper league. I have a league with some friends but my last three years but I've wanted to do a keeper league similar to franchise building with a large amount of keepers for position players. 

I would prefer head-to-head total points but that's not really a must for me. 




 Hey how much would you charge for some raw footage? I live in Virginia Beach but this would be really cool for some of my condominium listings. 




 Dwa dwa, I win. 




 I need a boat... 




 Submit an offer is greyed out until I make an agreement with the player. I accidentally put my game on vacation mode at the very beginning and the CPU signed many players for much less then what they demanded. 

It's annoying because if I ask for a response and it's low they raise the demanding price. Just out of curiosity I kept asking for a response and a player demanding 2 million got up to 12 million dollars. I simmed ahead 2 weeks and tried to resign him and he was still asking for 12 million even though he was only demanding 2.

Thank you
 




 Edit: Whoaaaa, I was not expecting gold for such a stupid comment but thank you!! 




 Yurp 




 Very frustrating but I ended up pulling up OOTP on finder and was able to delete it from there. I went back to the App Store and redownloaded the game. Surprisingly (or maybe not if you're more advanced in Mac's/Safe Files/etc) my saved games were still present. 




 Figured it out, but thank you! 




 First off I know this is my fault. I know I'm an idiot, and I know I'm not worthy. Ok now that I have made my peace this is what I did last night. 

I own OOTP, purchased VIA APP STORE on my macbook pro. I downloaded patch #6 from the official forums. I did not read the disclaimer not to do this. I downloaded and added to my apps. Now I can't delete the game from my apps list and it thinks I'm using a demo version of the game. Please help

 United States STAND UP WIT US, favorite comment of the night. 




 Destroying cop cars and public property is evidently peaceful protest.  




  I feel like the reporters in this room did not listen to a word this man said in his incredibly detailed account of the shooting...actions that led up to it...the evidence the grand jury saw...testimony of witnesses and so on...they are just asking "why are you a bad man" type questions over and over 
























 I just looked at the measurements and I was shocked to see that Indochino added a few inches to what I measured for my chest, I'm guessing thats why the suit is fitting the best. I really don't understand though I had someone else measure my chest, I actually measured my chest multiple times and it was always around 42" but Indochino changed it to 45.5"

* Side note, this is really important to me and I thank everyone for the informative feedback. 




 Strange thing is I got my third suit today from Indochino and it surprisingly fits well compared to the other 2. I'll post photos as well this evening. 

I read the problem in the back could be a collar problem?  




 I'm so conflicted with colors on my business cards but wouldn't a high end market want purple or gold? Or a blue for calming/trust?  




 Does reading memes on Reddit count?  




 http://imgur.com/a/poUf7

Ok so first I apologize for the photo quality and while the photos look blurred, it's a shadow. Should I take a photo in anymore stances to better help gauge the fit?

The Black Lapel suit is the black suit. I'm overall satisfied with it but it feels just a little too tight. The back is clearly not fitting right but I also think it's from my horrible posture.

The grey suit is from suit supply. I was really impressed with the material. Similar to the black lapel, I think my posture is screwing it up. I was trying to stand straight and I didn't have many opportunities to redo the photograph because I basically had to bed my roommate to take photographs of me in the corner of my room anyway. The Suit Supply pants need to be hemmed but I felt like the Black Lapel pants may need to be hemmed as well, whats your thoughts?

Thank you! 




 I feel like the opening scene is the beginning of Cersei going full Joffrey and fucking people up. 




 I'm waiting until 4k can run on an individual graphics card at 60 fps. Been waiting for about a year now but I'm thinking I only have another year to wait.  




 Yeah and honestly I put about $2400 into a gaming PC (this including all accessories) but looking at AnAndTech 'for sale' forums and Reddits HardwareSwap subreddits, I think the next PC I build (hopefully another year from now) will be comprised mostly of used parts. I can't believe how cheap you can get a 780 etc. 




 I sold my gaming PC so I don't really have any dog in this fight but why release another graphics card when you're already the fastest?  




 Little Person - Jon Brion 




 I've decided to split between you and /u/jsnen and go with a 40L, time will tell. I don't know a lot about fashion/suits but when I receive all 3 suits I'll do a lot of photos and give a brief review of what I think as well as getting your opinions.

Went with this:
http://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/suits/washington-light-grey-plain/P3829I.html?vpid=P3829I16 




 http://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/suits/washington-blue-plain/P4240I.html?start=3 cgid=Suits prefn1=styleFit prefv1=Contemporary-Washington

EXAMPLE:

I think I would go with this suit but my arms are too long for the 38R, which is requests but the chest seems to be way too big in the 40R.

Edit: And just checked trousers.. would be completed f *!ed with the 38 pants.  




 Well I meant more along the lines of how to measure. I have my measurements but what measurements should I make sure are the most accurate, and what areas are easier to tailor. 




 Couple measurements I forgot to include:

Jacket Length: 31.25" 
Pant Length: 41.25"

 




 So long story short, business has been good. I've always wanted to wear a suit daily and I'm near that point now. If you look at my previous posts, I purchased an Indochino suit (scheduled April 19th) and a Black Lapel suit (scheduled April 19th) Well I was able to put a couple more big closings together and I was already planning to do somewhat of an amateur review for you guys, so I decided I would look at purchasing a suit from Suit Supply. Unfortunately I'm not near a Suit Supply, is it possible to to still purchase a suit from them? I have my measurements from Black Lapel/Indochino to reference, but I don't know how well they would translate to Suit Supply. 

Height: 6'1" 
Weight: 195 pounds
Jacket Length: 31.25"
Chest Size: 41.75"
Lower Waist: 37.5"
Upper Waist: 36"
Shoulder Size: 18.75"
Sleeve Length: 25.25"
Hips: 42.50"
Waist: 37.50"
Thigh: 25.50"
Knee: 16"

Any suggestions or what should I look for? Thank you.
 




 Interesting. My foot wouldn't actually come out of the shoe but I just didn't want my heal to continually rub the back of these shoes and I end up destroying $400 shoes. But thank you for the response, I think I'll continue to wear them then!  




 I went to Brooks Brothers today and purchased two pairs of Peal   Co. Shoes. I tried on an 11 wide and they were extremely tight. I have very high arches. I tried on the 11 1/2 wide and they seemed to fit perfectly. Like a moron, I didn't really walk around too much with them on. I get home and decide to put on one of the pairs before running back up to the office.

That's backstory, so I've noticed when walking my heel moves up just a little bit. Not enough to come out of the shoe but my heel is moving a bit up and down when I step. Is this minimum amount of movement normal or should I take them back? What would be another solution, considering the 11's seemed so tight? 

Thank you! 




 (FIX)

Well I was on here a few minutes ago bitching and then I got on live chat and was bitching but they actually helped me. It's the wifi being stupid. I took my phone off wifi mode then clicked verify and it immediately verified.  




 Did they have it fixed because I bought a PS4 today and the same exact fucking thing is happen. I was a PC gamer. Decided I don't game as much sold it, purchased a PS4: regrets are happening! 




 I just bought a PS4 and I'm trying to verify my account. I receive the email but when I click on the verification or try to log into PSN from the website and either way it just sits loading and then times out. 




 I bought a PS4 today and I get home send the e-mail, receive the e-mail to verify my PSN account, and what do you know, the website won't load to verify jack shit. 




 Well I'll do a mini review as well. I ordered a suit off Black Lapel as well, so time will tell. 




 Great job!! 




 I was debating going for the Premium Navy Pinstripe on sale. Currently I only have an older black suit and I plan to have enough suits to have options weekly, but I wanted to purchase essential colors first; navy, grey, charcoal, black. Was there a notable difference between the premium and essential?

Just had a great run of closings and my budget has increased a bit. I purchased the essential navy blue today and I'll probably purchase one off of black lapel today as well for comparative purposes. Then I think I'll just purchase 3 or 4 from whoever I'm most satisfied with.  




 I really appreciate the fact that you responded almost immediately after I posted. To be completely honest with you, I like the appearance of some of the Black Lapel suits more then Indochino. I recently received a $100 gift card to Joseph A. Bank and went to purchase some dress shirts, the service was terrible. I'm in sales and customer service is huge to me. So even though I think my next purchase may be at Black Lapel just for comparative purposes, I took advantage of the 'HAVEITALL' sale today and purchased the essential blue sharkskin suit, a white dress shirt, and blue tie + a tie clip (unrelated to the sale). I probably would have went with a lighter blue off of Black Lapel first so tell your boss he needs to buy you lunch. Thank you again. 




 Just look up Brian Buffini. It basically is a referral driven system where you keep in contact with your previous clients with what I consider informative information. I would go into the whole sales pitch but I'm still in the office and I really want to finish work for the day. If you have any questions after looking into it, I would love to answer them for you. Once again there may be better services out there but I personally love the referral maker CRM. 




 If you have the money to spend, I love the Referral Maker CRM. It's rather pricey but I've received quite a lot of business as a direct result from it, and I feel like it's one of the best layouts, extremely user friendly.  




 If I could have a dollar for every post I made about a rumor or leak for the 390 from AMD, I would post so *hard* 




 I know there's quite a few posts about this but I have a few questions beyond the typical. I've already purchased the Indochino Tailor Kit and received my 16 fabric swatches and tape measurer. 

1) I've received my tailoring kit. I've been checking the site occasionally. What is considered a great sale for them? When I see this sale when should I know it's time? 

2) I've seen Indochino vs. Black Lapel reviews and it seems like Black Lapel was always slightly ahead. But I've also recently seen posts that have mentioned that Indochino has gotten their act together. Is this much closer or would I be foolish to purchase an Indochino premium suit? 
* Bonus question, I believe I know this answer but Indochino's measuring tape should work fine with Black Lapel's suits right? I know it's almost definitely a yes, but I have to ask. 

3) I don't have a suit supply near me. I do have a Brooks Brothers and a Joseph A. Bank. I really would rather go the custom suit direction. I feel like I've never had a suit that fit me "perfectly" and I'm not in a rush so sending suits back would not be an issue. 

- Budget should be noted. I could spend up to $1,500 but realistically I need a few suits. I would like to catch a sale similar to JoS A. Bank where I could buy one "nice" suit for $1,000-1,500 range and get a few free. But I would much rather start my collection with a very nice suit and just continually build suits around that then spend $1,500 for a 3-4 so/so suits that I will want to replace in a short time.

 THANK YOU!!!!!!!!! WHEN THIS SHIT HITS 2.32 I'M GOING TO SAMS CLUB AND BUYING SOME FUCKING INDUSTRIAL SIZED BOXES OF CEREAL AND FUCKING PIZZA ROLLS #YOUonlyOWNamdONCE 




 *slaps* Don't be such a pussy. I'm still in, stay strong!!! We're going to be rich!!!! 




 Yeah I didn't know that until about a week ago. You know who told me about Garmins dope smart watches? My grandmother. #YOLODOLO 




 Stupid fucking 3 days settling 




 True. I just could never understand GoPro. It's a camera company with a one trick pony. I think the people that would use one, have it. I think 5Y down the road it will look a lot like Garmin does now. With that said, I know you're not investing for 5y down the road, hope you make bank. 




 Don't trust it. Don't like it. Won't play with it.  




 Do you know a Soros or a Buffett? 




 First off, thank you. Second. I went ahead and for shits and giggles repurchased around .30 (only $500 worth) but I was curious if this was going to go all willy wonka after-hours and in the morning and I'm fine with losing $500.  




 I'm still in 




 You have prophets, fuck, where do you buy those?  




 Riding this money train with you brother. Are we taking out my yacht or yours? I've got $2,000 at 2.30 = GONNA BE A THOUSANDAIRE TOMORROW !!! 




 I saw about 60 million people running off the bridge jumping for a full day and I couldn't see exactly where they were jumping but I could hear them going WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, so at the very end of the day I decided to jump. It was a really fun ride but I went back up and there was 62 million people jumping today but the bridge just felt different so I decided to ask whats down there this time. But once again... I decided fuck it and jumped. I pray you hear me yelling Weeeeeee in the morning. 
 




 After Hours is looking positive. 




 NO. 




 Second question, I know nobody truly knows with a stock this volatile but what should people be looking at to help indicate the direction of this stock?

Thank you! 




 Oh great leaders where the hell is this one headed? I've jumped out and jumped back in. Debating keeping it overnight, I figured I would see what great advice I could receive to continue to YOLO. 




 I've got $2,000 just sitting around on AMD for the last week or so at $2.30.

*high five* 




 I hope so. I showed up late to the party and ended up losing money. I bought back in at $5.95. Hoping to recoup my losses and maybe a little in the morning. 




 How does today end? I'm tempted to jump in right before the day closes out. 




 How do I get in on this?  




 No I hesitantly gave him the card and stood over his shoulder watching him. I wish I had a cooler story but basically he explained the law and I acted nonchalant while also googling the law on my phone and realized we probably weren't being robbed.  




 You know nothing John Snow!!!!!! 




 I was passing through New Jersey with my girlfriend and we stopped to get gas. I legitimately thought the guy was trying to steal my girlfriends credit card. 




 Garett Richards.. It was a great day.  




 This was the closest thing I could find to an appropriate place to post this:

How much do you think I should sell my LG 47LX9500. It's hardly been used, I really mean that. Probably turned on once every 3 months. I could use it but if I could sell it for a decent amount, I don't watch enough TV to really care and would just buy something cheaper. 

Thanks 




 I sure as hell hope it doesn't because I've purchased ~~a lot of it's stock today~~, well a lot for me.  




 You killed it today with AVEO  




 Yeah I only spent $500 so I just don't really care and I'm riding it down. 




 Bought in at 7.25 and it just keeps dropping, should I take my losses? 
























 I've been long on these guys and I'm taking a beating so take this as a long sad YOLO HJ but I don't see how much longer EXXI can be shorted until we see a rebound. They had unimpressive numbers but with oil on the rise and the stock down to around $3.30 I went ahead and doubled down. I hope to see a big rebound back into the high $4's once we get some positive news. Just my 2 cents, I'm also still taking a loss on AMD, the yolo life is really hard lately but it's only a loss if you sell so time will tell.  




 Well that sucks.... 




 Should say 'Outside Opinion on my team' and mm.... that's tough. Maybe carry Iwakuma, if you need immediate success (falling behind in standings etc) any 3 of those would work.  




 Eh 2 active spots.. Iwakuma will be hurt for a while and I agree about Fister being pretty good too. Is a Fiers, Syndergaard, Paxton, type guy available? Whats the best pitchers available right now? Sorry just can't really answer that last one without knowing who's available. I do think Iwakuma is a top 30-50 starter.

EDIT: btw look at my most recent post about my team. I asked for feedback but I guess I posted it in the wrong spot but would love to hear your feedback as well. 




 1) Screw Werth, especially if you have a deep outfield which you mentioned in comment #2. 

2) Rios was ripping the ball before he left. If you can afford the space, why not give him a couple of weeks to see what he can do? 

3) Is your DL maxed? Could you just keep Iwakuma on your DL? If he's not hurting anything, I don't think it hurts to leave him on. I think this is the most important player of the three to keep around.  









 I have Anthony Rendon and Victor Martinez... so.... 




 I have Trout, J. Upton, and Brantley and I still picked him up. I'll use him for my utility spot (currently Joc Pederson) but I'm debating dropping Castillo for Correa and really rolling the dice because my SS is weak. Right now I have it setup to drop my catcher for Correa if I get him on the waiver wire because I was going to drop my catcher anyway and that will give me the rest of the week to make a decision but I'll need a catcher before Monday.  




 Welp SPHS worked out but EXXI and AMD have still been lame.  




 That really is an easy one, definitely go with Rusney 




 Sitting on around 8k of EXXI at -1k ~~earnings~~ so this would be very much appreciated.  









 That table better have a hole for a fleshlight and send you winning lottery numbers the day before the drawing. 




 Im in AMD, have been for weeks!!!!! whoo 




 Sometimes a good purchase is when all the news is bad. I've been looking at SandRidge Energy. In around a months time this stock has dropped about 70%. Things are looking bad with bankruptcy looming but does anyone think this could be a YOLO type stock to jump in for a rebound?  




 Buying SPHS as my gamble for the week. Also going to load up on EXXI, I just don't believe oil will stay down forever and I think it's a good price point to jump in at.

EDIT: I forgot to mention I'm also sitting on 3k of AMD stock. I don't know if it will do shit but LONG LIVE AMD.  




 If you look at the history of JCP over the last 6 months to a year it does exactly that. His goals are a little different then ours. He's basically just using the $250,000 and he tries to have no more then 50k at a time invested, to supplement his living income. But he said he was probably bringing in around $30-50k a year just doing that. He's also very aware of JCP and all their earnings reports and the direction the company is going. A couple of times he's told me not to touch it for a couple of weeks because of uncertainty etc.  




 NIOBF looks like it's living a slow death at this point or atleast a flatline/slow decrease for a while.  




 He's different then WSB. Basically takes .75 then jumps out or puts a trailing stop on it. Chills on his waterfront property until it starts dipping, buys again. Basically living the life I want to live. Basically living the life I want but I only have 11k so I'm shooting for those crazy risky gains 




 I have a mentor that has about 250k in his investment accounts and he only trades JCP. He basically starts buying up around 7.5-8 and starts selling around 9.50-11 and basically rinse repeat. He's been doing this for months.  




 Been in AMD with /r/ddplz for sometime and today was the first day I got within breaking even, feeling like I'll be plus +5 mil very soon.  




 Well that would explain it. Haven't spoken to him in a couple weeks but would love to see him get more of a shot up there. I have a couple of friends in the bigs that I played with but he's got the best story, really cheering for him. 




 What programs is he using and how did he learn?  




 I'm a little bias because I'm good friends with Ian Thomas but can they let this motherfucker throw, he hasn't thrown in 2 weeks it seems like. 




 I don't know how difficult it is to setup but it definitely doesn't hurt to try. I know I would definitely contribute.  




 I don't think this is a bad idea but it's sort of like my business as a Realtor. If you're not going to do it 100% of the time, then don't bother implementing it because it just becomes a waste of time. I can see a lot of people not doing this and just getting sort of a scattered view of the direction people are going. Plus I've been lurking for sometime on /r/wallstreetbets and I like the place WSB is right now but you start to walk a dangerous line where the post starts to look like a YAHOO message board with people blurting out absolute insanity and those retards will spill over to the other posts and all of WSB will be affected.  




 I made money and I am an idiot...  




 One day my friend... One day.  




 I feel like Gods playing Plaque Inc. trying to take us out. 




 Thanks for the comment. I'm actually not trading with all my money but I'm stuck with my 2 other trades. I have around $1600 in AMD and $2700 in EXXI and both are down right now so I'm just dwindling my thumbs with those. 




 I've traded beyond settlement before and I got a firm warning by Scottrade and by firm, they tried to solicit using margins and to take a moment to read their knowledge center. You know what, F U C K your knowledge center. I want to trade. I turned 6k to 8k and this week I turned 8k to 11k and tomorrow if I can jump into GEVO I think I can turn 11k into 11.1k but let me fucking trade. 

How YOLO/Risky is it to say fuck you, and trade regardless of the amount of settled funds I have for "trading" vs. settled funds. Don't wave GEVO pussy in front of a roaring bull. 

#YOLO


Edit: May be a little angry that I am forced to the sidelines. In my haste I realized I put RIBT and PBTI. Disregard or go YOLO but I meant RIVT and PTBI. If you get lockjaw from RIBT or PBTI, just know I did not reference these make believe unicorns. #WinterIScoming 
























 What is this feeling of the walls creeping in, the quiet noise of forever, and the different shades of black. To bow without achievement, to leave without ever being known. I can not disclose my identity in the interest of protecting what I write. 

Look to the stars and tell me how big you feel? Take notice of the dirt below your feet and describe to me your home. There is so much *life* for you outside of the shell you currently *possess*.  

Envision a boy that battles daily with imaginary monsters. Each day the monsters make the boy more frightened. The boy flees to the nearest forest. He carefully constructs a fort made of branches. The boy feels free of the imaginary monsters, but wolves own this forest. 

What came first God or Man?

I cannot disclose my identity because my existence has long since expired, I don't know how long it took the wolves to pick up the scent of the boy, and I've never met God, but look to the stars and tell me how big you feel? 




 When you're mathematically out. Last year I had a bunch of injuries. Literally made the playoffs on the last game of the season by losing (the other guy lost too and I had more total points) Had to play our league leader that was something like 21-2 and I basically just meat shielded him (Put random double starters in every slot I had) and somehow won. Then went on to win the championship which was my 2nd in a row #Whoo!  




 I'm a bit of a morbid but let this be a reminder to us all, death is coming. I only hope I can do great things while I'm here. 




 This was exactly what I wanted and scared the daylights out of me but thank you! 




 I miss Ultima Online quite immensely. I was one of those rare weirdos that was fairly good at PvP and RP. I have somewhat of an idea to mesh the two. I'm working quite a bit and don't really have knowledge of constructing a shard. Could you have someone construct a shard and have it up and running for around $500 or is that unrealistic? I know it varies on the scope of work to be done so this is just more general estimates to anyone who has ever paid to have some work done on their servers.

How would you rate my trades? Would you recommend any areas I should look to improve? I'm trying to "regrow my farm" as far as pitchers because of all the trades. I'm thinking of trying to improve my reliever situation but I don't think I want to spend what it would take to get an elite reliever. I think the most I would trade would be Kazmir and I don't think the people holding the best relievers right now would go for that.  




 How do you go about that? I don't see a way to get around the price.

 Yeah I completely understand the idea that the best time to buy is whenever you're "ready," but I feel like 4K is pushing the advancement of GPU's faster and we're on the cusp of a large leap in hardware, similar to SSD's. I was tempted with the 980ti as well. Hopefully AMD's next GPU will be worth some of the hype and force Nvidia to quickly push something else out. I just want 60 FPS for 4K at around $500, then basically ride that out for 3-4 years before going SLI for another 3 or 4.  




 I sold my PC about 2 years ago and I've been itching to get another one. It's killing me because I feel like we're so close to 1 *affordable* GPU running 4k at 60 FPS, so I've been just patiently waiting... reading PC and hardware subreddits and crying.  




 I'll donate $15

Whats the purpose of shards anymore anyway. Each shard should just have different rules, and have like 10 shards. I know this option is currently impossible because people would lose properties etc so take this as more of a rant.

 The trick for me is if you miss a Monday or you just don't feel like going on a Monday or a Tuesday etc because you won't be able to get a full workout in etc, just go the following day or force yourself through a day you don't want to be there. I can't tell you how many lazy weeks have started on Wednesday but I still continued the rest of the week instead of starting a bad habit.

Also this is a little more difficult but I have a few friends I go to the gym with. It varies daily but it helps keep me motivated if I'm having one of those above mentioned "off" days where I'm not feeling it. 




 I've been holding him on my non-dynasty team but it's getting old..., if SS wasn't my weakest position I would probably had ditched him already. 




 Not sure but if you keep giving amazing tips I'll follow you to whatever  subreddit you like. 




 Really going to down vote? It wasn't Vietnam or some other controversial war, it's fucking WW2.  




 Your great uncle is a hero. 




 Never used or heard of Robin Hood. Zero commissions, where's the shitty part of this story. Truthfully I just watched their intro video and that was it. 




 I just did a trade that was centered around Hamels (3 other players also included) for Kershaw the day before the Braves outing, I feel awesome...  




 Not bad at all but my problem is I want to style my hair like that without all the height. Still enjoyed the video, good job.  




 Hey I just wanted to say incredible job!! 




 He was also always ready to pull out a bouquet of flowers from behind his back.
