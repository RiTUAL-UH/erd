 Three minutes later and the kee kee would have a treat and bring it to your feet. It's hard to reward your cat for being a faithful provider when it comes to cute little animals. But such is nature. But I'm glad you saved the lil' guy. 




 Creepy yes. But I'm guessing rural area, deer bait, posed (Sweet ass creepy alien doll) and trail cam. I love this shiez! Upvote! 




 Wow! This brings back some fond memories.
Sat rite next to this one http://www.rubylane.com/item/756627-BWx20x7ex201610/1981-Scary-Stories-To-Tell 




 I love how street view is old timey.
 




 Anyone notice this guys hands are extremely large in accordance with his body size? He could choke a bitch!
 




 Bitcoin has to work! It's time to be truly free everybody. 




 Ha! This made me laugh.
 




 I am 31, our first isp was Prodigy. We had a 14.4 external dial up modem on our 64 mb hd, IBM 386 . When we first logged on I noticed there was a game button on the sweet 16 bit windows 3.1, 12" brilliant 32 color display CRT monitor. Where in the World is Carmen San Diego, the rest is history. Thanks for the memory... Prodigy, I'm getting all nostalgic. But I agree, Bitcoin is here to stay because it is the next big thing. Happy mining. 




 Its /r/wtf because "WTF!?! how did he do that!" 




 Looks like a painting. 




 Oh hellz yeah! I loved these things, and who remembers they didn't skimp on the Puddin'. They filled the whole delicious pie crust cavity with the mutagen ooze. 




 Good for you brother! Keep it up. 




 We hit 87.70 folks! I am the proud owner of some damn spending money in BTC now.
 




 Amen brother! 




 If you squint, it's an Orca Tie-fighter! 




 The audio for this clip is hilarious! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-ogs0EmMMk 




 Steve Slothscemi?
 




 Bruce Campbell? 




 Looks like a Vagina good sir, hence the "Kinda" in NSFW. But thanks for putting me in my place. 




 5th painting is really cool, I dig that Sharon Osbourne wears Converse.
 




 I myself was introduced by a friend very early on about Bitcoin, back when you could mine one BTC in a pool every 2-4 days, unfortunately for me I stopped at 9.35 BTC about 2 years ago. I have updated my wallet and am now worth 437 US dollars :) I will sit on them for some time and watch my 12 dollars spent in electricity grow. 




 Yes, I have done this between 3 different PC's. Or you can find your wallet.dat file and drop it in several thumb drives like I do just to be safe. But I have a few more Bitcoins. Happy Mining :) 




 So I guess her name is "Philipina" ...clap..clap...... Ok I'll leave :/ 




 I mined Bitcoin late 2010 early 2011, I got up to 9.35 BTC then stopped :/. I recently heard a bunch of stuff about it and Found out I have 456 US dollars worth. I'm going to sit on them for awhile, I hear good things. 









 Will Smith's older brother....... Maybe.......
 




 A little like this :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVRPpJQjwMg 




 This is a BadAss picture bro :) it kinda has a Maurice Sendak, author of "Where the Wild Things Are" feel to it. Good Job! 




 Ha, Family Guy!
 









 Am I the only one who read this with Will Ferrell's voice in my head? 









 KILL IT WITH FIRE!!! 




 Yeah, I see the little guy next to the bench on the lower left of the screen, looking at the camera.
 




 Its Sylvester Stallone. 




 I got him when I was 12, I will miss him very much :( 









 BOOBS :) 




 ET phone home. 




 Happened to me... It stinks, but the only way to get all the plastic off is to turn it on high until it stops smoking :/  (Box fan in kitchen window)
 




 I got one a month or so ago... 1 word (Eeeewwww!) 





























 So this is only effecting the Dwolla us money transfer correct? 




 They are making Nickelodeon Gak! Good Memories. 




 Awe! That's so cute. You just kinda wanna pick him up and put him in your pocket. 




 If its real silver you might have a couple hundred bucks. A nice investment if it was a sleep purchase. 




 Ha, clever. 




 Looks like a bugina! 




 It's cute, you got a lil' skin tomato growing out of you. 




 Fuck that! Dirty, creepy, submerged dolls can can go fuck themselves! 




 Maybe an NSFW tag, there's a-holes out there that will complain. (UPVOTED)

 I'm thinking maybe in the location where this bus is, a rear emergency exit is required by law. These buses aren't cheap so maybe, perhaps, this is cheaper than buying one with exits already installed.  




 Yum! Enough of these and you would be a Fatayass. 




 They are the same chick! (Hands in pockets, head down. Walks away) 




 I forgive you. 




 Looks a little like Hugh Grant. 




 Like any /r/Bitcoin anyone will tell you, If it's going to make you have to move back in to mom and dads if it crashes, don't do it. But if you live at home or have the extra money? Go for it! The latest DDOS attacks and the lack in value drop tell you a little something about the resilience and sheer Spartanism that is Bitcoin.

 I like the huge transactions are, well, Huger? is that a word, I dunno. Just watched a 2000 BTC float by, 238,000 USD at current price. Crazy shits! 




 Pugwenbat... That is all.
 




 This is good, You are a very good artist. Do not think bad of yourself, anyone who can create beauty from sadness is worth a damn. 




 I personally think the curly cue pube stuck on the end of the cap is a nice touch. 




 I work in a frozen foods warehouse and we sell these. I giggled the first time I saw them. 









 ... Day before the crash...... I am le depressed :( 




 I don't know why this doesn't have more up votes, this is funny as Hell!

 No! White glasses are for douche bag hipsters!

 Dang, You can only get scones here. Crumpets sound delicious!  




 I have le work tomorrow so I have to got to bed. It would be nice to see another 40$ jump. 




 We need the price to go up another 40 bucks! 




 When I worked at Safeway 15 years ago or so, we would have employee parties and there would be way to much food, I'm talking in excess of 5 time to much. Instead of sending leftovers home with employees, or better yet, donating to a local charities. They had us (Courtesy clerks) throw all the food into the trash compactor. I asked my GM why they didn't donate the food or send it home with the employees and he said "If we send it home with you guys that's stealing, If we donate it we make less than writing it off as a loss." Fucked up as far as I am concerned. There's homeless people rite outside of where I worked.... GIVE IT TO THEM DOUCHES! 




 Maybe post /r/atheist ? That circle jerk will get you mui Karma. 




 Dammit buttsophagus, every time I think I get something first.... 




 I am into Bitcoin because I have been poor, don't like it, got a good job, got laid off, couldn't find another one, searched for an equivalent (Or one that paid more than unemployment) and didn't find one. Got re-hired and wish i had been mining for the last 2 1/2 years because I would be able to buy a house now. Hind sight is a bitch! 




 That. Or they are a big "Player" in the game and wanted to spread the word and/or wealth. Just a thought. 




 That's 26k US current BTC price.... I would just die, be dead, kilt myself even. Poor guy. 
























 Very good essay, I was diagnosed with ADHD in my youth, never medicated. I am almost 32 and am thankful I never was medicated. I get a lot of my creativeness from my ADHD. It looks as though your daughter does too. But at the same time I did lousy in school (Frowny face) She should be a writer, She's really good. 




 Such a good book, but so sad. 




 Up voted, But yeah, more Awesome then WTF I'd say. 




 Come on guys, that's just a raisin, it's their "One raisin Only" bread.  




 We get a similar one here in PDX called "Busted" Is it called that in SC? 




 Is it 1987? Or has Stone wash denim come back? 




 I'm old and my feet hurt, Why are we here again? Oh crap, I just pooped! 




 I'm pretty sure that's a spinal column in the bottom right.

 We only have the frozen microwave White Castle hamburgers here sadly. Stupid Ol' Portland Oregon! 




 "Urp!" 




 I live in Portland as well, I worked in the famous Hawthorne district. Has anyone seen the Aztec stone Ford tempo wagon? Or the 1000 troll doll car? My favorite was the homeless Rastafarian guy, Nice as hell and never asked for money, only bummed smokes.  




 You know, for some reason I was thinking Washington too, weird. 




 Oh that furry boot! 




 Here's a thought, small earthquakes "tremors" combined with the hard salt flats. Take a rock on your coffee table and turn your cell phone on vibrate ^(Or other vibratey thingy)

 Okay, quick question. How does Bart reach the top of the chalkboard to write the sentences? He's way to short, and I see no stool! 




 Oh Cheesus Crust! 




 Yes what Captain_Generous said. Recipe maybe? Please and thank you. Looks delicious! 




 Why is Robert De Niro spanking this girl? 




 Meth hookers are fun to spot on 82nd. 




 Good ole Portland. This restaurant Gave us lots of laughs in High school. Anyone else here go to Benson? 




 What do you mean "You people" ? 




 The expiration isn't that far off, the date obviously is may ?? 2013. But as RozTron says, "What do you expect when you get apple slices at friggin Wendy's??" I think you'll be ok. 




 Or as happy as the people who have herpes. Have you seen those commercials? Apparently you get to Kayak, go mountain biking, stay at very expensive bed ad breakfast's, and are always beautiful or handsome. My herpes don't do anything like that, they itch. I wish I was as happy as those yogurt eating herpes having lucky SOB'S! 




 Is T "1910" the model year? 




 And here too. We should have a support group for "Ass broken" wooden spoons. 




 This is actually a sign from God that he wants to kill you in the creepiest way possible with other worldly nightmare insects. Just a thought.

 I own a GEO Metro, earlier model, a 1991, This has always been a fear of mine in an accident. But I would rather drive a 900$ GEO Metro that gets 40 mpg city, 50 highway, than a $25k Prius. And GEO's use only gas not $3k worth of batteries plus gas. 




 They look like Asian pot stickers, but more importantly whats inside? 




 Looks delicious!  




 And leaving University only cost six dollars forty! 




 Sweet! I have the Saitek Cyborg! Awesome keyboard. Mine did not come with a dead snake though.

 I like how fat chicks wear sandals because they think they're cute and trendy... No bitch, you're just fat and lazy! 




 Calm down, it's just a simple Cysterectomy. 




 We have them all over our warehouse grounds, several acres. I asked a security guard why he would use them and that is exactly why. 




 My dad has one similar to this one. Does the panel with the 4 buttons on it slide downward revealing more buttons? 




 Maybe an axle to a toy car, [Here](http://www.king-tower.com/product/986613874-218823885/car_axle.html) is a site that sells them. 




 I was just going to say that. 




 It's nice to see the top comment be a happy ending and not a Joke or sexual innuendo such as "Now she has a fourth hole!" or something like that. 









 HA! (there doesn't seem to be anything here) I get it... Black fathers don't stick around... RACIST! But funny... And racist... funny...racist... Shit! I'm stuck in a funny out weighs the racist but racist isn't funny paradigm Loop! 




 No one will probably get this, but does the third picture remind anyone of Alice's Restaurant by Arlo Guthrie? 




 Ha! True that.

 He forgot how to doughnut. 




 This is awesome! You may have started a trend for next Halloween. 




 It wasn't the cake you pretentious tool! He rescued it from a factory farm so its all GMO'd up. It's probably more realistically some genetic disorder from all the Selective breeding. Kudos to you OP for saving the little gal.  




 I just checked my 50BTC account and had 56btc, I only had .01 last I checked, I tried the payout and it said not enough bitcoins, then my real total appeared. That's 11k In USD, That would really help. But it's just a glitch.

 True, Helium is a natural element, There is a limited supply, kind of like oil. The more we use the less there is and the more it costs.

 I'm surprised this does not have more upvotes. 




 If you notice, the plastic plug mold is supposed to be apposing itself (One pointing up, the other down), it's not melted, just Older styling. 50's or 60's Id say. And possibly asbestos coating, It's okay people, asbestos wont kill you if you don't crunch it up into dust and start breathing it in for a month or two. Enjoy your time. Don't be all weary of the creepy plug.

 Love Stephen King! 




 Ha ha ha! [Pain like this!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8-L6UJ6XR8) 




 I can verify this. I work in a freezer, temps are between -10 and -25 degrees Fahrenheit. Years back when my hands would get unbearably cold I would rush to the bathroom and run them under hot water, then a few minutes later they would be in throbbing pain. I was told to not do that because it causes nerve damage over time. Cold slowly to warm is what to do.  




 I love this! Very clever. i Dios mo, es inteligente ! 




 My dad and I did this to my girlfriends old 84 Subaru. $2.99 Momentary switch and 58c worth of wire and a little know how. Better than the $300-$400 professional fix. 









 If you look, he is holding it out towards the camera on a stick. Optical illusion. But shit, 6' 9"! 




 No one should have to go through this. You are a brave individual... Borrow the keys and go to to Taco Bell, Doritos Locos friend. 




  I often have dreams in which I cannot tell whether they happened or were dreamed. Usually these dreams were preceded by a night of drinking, albeit sometimes not much drinking, but drinking none the less. If not maybe ask a doctor, or perhaps before you go to sleep write in a journal of your day and person to person encounters. Then keep a separate journal for when you wake up to report your Dreams/false memories and compare the two. Good luck, I hope it's nothing serious. 




 Ha ha ha, A horse mask.... Your moms hot! 




 Diabesity

 The stain looks like a homeless guy puking. 




 She needs to take from another "Her own Thomas" like her aunt Candice did for the betterment of her own life. It's kind of a black widow story, eat your mate for nutrients/survival. Good story.  




 Adderal is a brain drug, Maybe it activated a psychokinesis type of reaction. Just a thought. 




 Spooky. 




 Good story... At least I hope it's a story. 




 That pun needs a little, "shine". 




 I am pretty sure what is going on here is after you start your shower, the pipes start to heat up. They swell/shrink in their mountings make noise after a moment or two. Take and enjoy your shower friend. Unless you start hearing voices.... DUN DUN DUN!!!

 Awesome pic, Give this guy a hand...Wait...

 Oh man! Good story. This should be on the NoSleep podcast. Gave me the jitters for sure. I was Taken in to the whole story by paragraph 2. 




 Still would! 




 If you squint, like you have been in the pool to long, the white part looks like a pile of poop with a big stink line.

 This is awesome! 




 Amen Hatchet_Kilo! And why is this not a God damned Series? I love it, it has AS written all over it! To their credit they single handedly got Family Guy back making new episodes. And yes NotHimAgain I will agree, Superjail was awesome and way grosser than this Korgoth show. But in its own special way, Korgoth of Barbaria is a medieval Superjail.  




 It looks like he's saying, "I MUNT THPUGHETTI!"

 I have not, She has a plastic fetish too so this is an excellent Idea. I'm going to try it! 




 This is very true, you said it so well too. I do appreciate the effort it takes for my cats affection, It's like playing a really hard level to beat in a video game. It's frustrating but when you actually beat the level you feel accomplishment. But instead of a feeling of accomplishment you get affection. 




 Excellent read, Touching story. Good on you for treating this sad individual to some human respect by visiting his grave. He had no-one and now he has you to remember him. 




 I have a female cat "Babs" I bought her a 30$ Cat Bed all plush, soft inviting and what not. She knows it's for her, she acknowledged it but sleeps not on it but in front of it... Cats are dicks but we love them. Why?

 That is the fattest most worthless piece of shit excuse for a human I have ever had the displeasure of watching for a short time. And she/it has the audacity to yell at her mother about who is playing the god damned piano? I would vote yes on a bill for euthanasia on worthless gub'ment suckling Pieces of human garbage like this fat blobenly  Tuna crotched degenerate! And snake bite piercings? What does that make you hot or something? I/Us all paid for those you well fair receiving burden! And you talk about art... You are nothing close to art, you are a disgusting burden and EXACTLY what is wrong with America. Get a job you fat bitch!

 There is always one dick shoe on the internet that sits in the shadows waiting for some poor bastard to misspell a word/name so he can pounce and a make him/herself feel like they have some sort of authority or power in their utterly meaningless (I live in my parents basement) shoddy existence. But he got a few upvotes, that's better than sex to him/her. 




 I cut them off at the ankles, I had Huge 125 lb ankles. 




 Good job guys. I was once 375 6'3" and am now 250. I know it has drastically changed your life for the better. 




 I am a "break even-er" And still mine. I own a few BTC and hash happily at 90 GH/s and still at about 6 dollars profit a day for the last 7 months. I have been in the game since 2011 and have a petty good understanding of how the price fluctuations go. This is the calm stage with the uncertainty if it will still be a viable currency. My "Gut" prediction is that it will be in the 3k-6k (US$) range in 6 months~ So I will not sell. 




 This happened a year or so after my girlfriends brother slammed his finger in the car door. His was essentially over production of calcium on the wounded spot. they took a doctors rotary rasp thingy to it and shaved it down. he got a band-aid and one stitch and they sent him on his merry way with a lollipop. No big deal brutha! 




 If you love your dog, bring him/her inside to sleep in your bed. Animals cannot tell you they are scared, but they get scared the same if not more so than we do as logical thinking individuals. Example: My cat is scared of floating balloons, She doesn't know how or why they float so it scares her (Cat Mind Fuck), we know why they float, helium is lighter than air etc... But get a picture if you see it again. Trail cam perhaps. 




 No amount of "White washing" would change the fact that everyone knows this is Neil Degrasse Tyson and he is African American and fricken awesome! Not everything has to be about race, I think its just a magazine cover, that's it.

 Newport, Oregon, [Undersea Gardens](http://www.marinersquare.com/undersea-gardens/) and an [outside view](http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cd/84/b5/oregon-undersea-gardens.jpg). Cool place. 




 That's exactly what I was thinking. Across the street from Rippley's and the wax museum. I think they call it the undersea gardens or something. 




 Oh man, 350 bucks I paid for the [voodoo 3dfx 3500](http://img.tomshardware.com/us/1999/11/18/3dfx_productshot.jpg), TV tuner and video in was crazy technology!

 That is a shrimp I think. 




 I'm pretty sure the old cases took AT style motherboards. The new standard is ATX so that case is no good. And the power supply was probably like a 230 watt, not to mention Windows 7 takes 35 gigs (For 64 bit) 7.5g is too small, That old AGP card couldn't even run angry birds. Try finding games and software to install on "CD rom". So, New case, new mother board, new hard drive, new DVD rom drive, new graphics card, new power supply, Oh and ram, lets not forget that= New PC. Your old CRT monitor should still work. If Emachines honored all that for 99$, They most certainly would Rock! 




 Thank god I'm not the only one that does this, I thought maybe I had mental problissues.

 There aren't Many sinks while hiking with your dad and brother in the Columbia Gorge... But yes I do wash my hands, and I was 11 and in the woods. And typically you wash your hands after peeing, not before.  




 Both my cats do this, I can go anywhere in the house and they don't follow me, but The bathroom, every time. It's like poop noises are like purring to them or something.

 He put the NSFW to fool us... Bravo you sadistic bastard, bravo. 




 I like the melted butter one.. "You would fat so!" Hey shut up! 




 I got it on my hands, face, arms and crotch when I was about 11. I got something like that pussy boil thingy on my forehead and it oozed and crusted my eyebrows while I slept. No fun at all, I don't envy your current situation friend. Good luck. 




 She is not allowed to drive them anymore. It's the day after and when it comes down to it a car is "just a thing" and she is a person, who fucked up albeit 3x in the last year, but still cars can be replaced and she cannot. 




 She has a good personality, she also feels extremely bad. We have been together almost 4 years now. And yes I told her she is not allowed to drive them anymore for my own reasons mainly and insurance reasons. And you're correct "petite and pretty" has nothing to do with it. The reason I said "petite and pretty" was to give my pissed off brain something good to picture instead of anger towards her. It was an accident but one that kills me a little inside. 




 You don't have enough upvotes for this. I was thinking the exact same thing. 




 This is fucked up, I'm surprised this isn't national news.... But alas they were all white so it's not national news worthy. 




 Did he died? 




 Hydrocephalus James Woods. 









 Here's a [twist](http://i.imgur.com/TN1wtXy.jpg). 




 I'm 32, I grew up off NE Portland Blvd (Rosa Parks Blvd now), way gang banger until Alberta turned into Hawthorne II about 10 years ago. Man times are a changin'. I can own a bike now. 




 Ha! 




 What also is cool is when someone links an Amazon.com link and you are logged in and it saves it in your Amazon search history and displays it down at the bottom like you were looking for weird shit. 




 I live in Portland, He took a bong rip and held it for the length of the tunnel. [Proof](http://treasure.diylol.com/uploads/post/image/494166/resized_bad-advice-cat-meme-generator-to-be-honest-i-m-lying-f44661.jpg) 




 Basic rule, spend what you can afford to lose, encrypt your wallet with a giant password, don't invest in currently available miners, and keep your tray table in the upright position during takeoff. It's a fun/scary trip to the moon friend, good luck. 




 Asshole! 




 Ya know... A little bit yes. 




 You are correct, he doesn't take a bitr. But he does eventually get a bite, you just have to keep watching. 




 [Oh you!](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CBKcdvPBrdM/T03sulC5avI/AAAAAAAAALE/2Q_fnIJKp6g/s1600/13267748908.jpg) 




 Awwwe, I love you too! 
























 Well enough, were union so there's always the politics that I'm not fond of because of contract issues . But I Just go to work and do my best. You must be talking about Cash Carry. They are label sensitive and understandably so. But I dare anyone to try to keep a label on a frosty block of Western Family Ice cream. 




 I am Oldish (33) And you were allotted 8 characters back in the online gaming infancy days. In the early/mid 90's Microsoft had a server called IGZ (Internet Gaming Zone) that would launch you into a networked DOS promt from a chat box and the players would (Ex: cd/duke3d setup.exe/f4) and enter the games setup menu. Long story short, Its my initials MSD and 3D for my favorite game at the time. And thank you for the compliment. 




 I wish, I don't have the sweet ginger tight curl military box cut though. 




 The scenario I described does not happen that often at all. its an error on the side of the Customer(Store) and the distributor (Dudes who re-sent Package) Unfortunately human error is inevitable, this scenario is a double whammy, kinda like a unicorn but for frozen food.  But oh my god I love plastic bags... I live in Multnomah county but work in Clackamas county... You know how hard it is to pick up dog poo with paper bags? 




 [Here](http://imgur.com/cBDPsyR) is me and my Frozen Foods issued freezer jacket for Unified Grocers Milwaukie Oregon. Coming up on 8 years employed. The handle bar stache is standard issue. 




 I work in a Frozen food distribution warehouse, I have seen this before. What happens is the store leaves/forgets the product in an insulated [chest or tub](http://www.bonarplastics.com/Portals/0/Templates/images/PB30.jpg) and it sits in their storage with the pallets and what not for a week or more and the dry ice gets used up so it thaws. When the distributor comes to reclaim the chest or tub they throw it back on the refrigerated trailer and it refreezes. The frozen food warehouse employee assumes it's a return (Because its frozen still) and puts it back into the big freezer and then unfortunately it gets sent out to some sad unsuspecting store assuming the product is fine. 




 Don't forget the [salt and pepa](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yVjqDkwhF-Q/U0tNRUrUBWI/AAAAAAAAMbQ/pbCxVw_8vkE/s400/push-it-real-good-o.gif)

 Looks delicious! And a little like french toast Cookie Monster.

 Movember I think translates into Mustache November, Pre-dating No shave November. You're in your 30's like me huh? 




 You know, I used to hate cilantro with a passion. soapy flavor and all. But later in life I started to like it. I was curious why I hated it and now, buy it in bushels. I found several articles. [Here's one](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/dining/14curious.html?_r=0) that shed some light on as to why I like it now and didn't before. a slow introduction over time. and for some reason it doesn't even come close to reminding me of soap. 




 Nice, Its rare you see a newer car with an actual frame not all uni-body.
 




 Is your friend an Oregon resident? I have these at my home and they are big, quick and scary. I was talking to my father one time and thought I saw a mouse out of the corner of my eye... No, it was a big ass wolf spider! Nope de nope da fucking no! 




 Kind of has an MGMT feel to it. I like it, Kind of catchy. 




 Died by his bowl because he was hungry and waiting for food from those he relied on to take care of him.... The saddest thing I have seen in awhile. This brought a tear to my eye. 




 (3 letter response) Yep! 




 Is this an Iphone thing? I don't get the whole opaque grey bar with white text over picture thingy. I have seen a lot of these lately. I'm poor and have an S4 and am not a gay, retarded, mongoloid sheep with Tourettes syndrome. 




 This is true. 




 1 out of 50 of these fat scoot-about people has a medical condition that makes it so they have to use them. I am big (6'3 260), Part due to genes and part because I love good beer and meat. If I ever got to the point I was riding one of the electric scooters around WalMart with my giant swollen purple diabetic calves, I would re-examine my life choices. There is no excuse for laziness! Most of these Brobdingnagians Choose to be this way because its easier than working. Don't be lazy people.  




 Ha! Because she's a woman and women do dishes. This should be top comment. Have an upvote you witty sumbitch! 




 This looks scary but you know it's delicious. Cant go wrong with pistachios.  




 This is the body of a fat guy who has improved his life by losing a bunch of weight. I can relate, 6'3", 375 senior year to 245 at 32. Congratulations to this dude. Excess skin can only be remedied by surgery unfortunately. 




 They look like deliciously fattening deep fried kiwis. 




 Sometimes Plain is perfect. 




 My sentiments exactly. 




 Has anyone else gone through this experience? You're at a 7-11 or Plaid Pantry, the line is like 2 people long, you calmly take your place at the end (Curving because the aisles interfere) and someone walks to the other side of the curve and stands there with their delicious treats. For me it's 3 minutes of "Am I going to have to make an awkward situation by saying something?" And then their is the Dick fuck Busy business guy who grabs a paper and walks to the front of the line and throws the money down and raises the paper, shakes it and says keep the penny and walks out while you do the normal person thing and wait your turn. Or how about the fat disability lady who spends 12 minutes buying lottery tickets while 12 people wait behind her blobenly welfare recipient ass, she has nowhere to be, WE ALL DO! That's worse than cutting as far as I am concerned, Plus it's 8:30 and I have to be to work! Who buys lottery tickets at 8:30 in the morning!!! But yeah I hate cutters. 




 Looks like someone dates a black guy... Okay I'll leave. 




 Just as! Way more WTF than hot girl in pink goo/jewels.

 If you read all the links the others have posted its pretty easy to come to your conclusion. Not creepy... Cool and interesting with all the lore behind it, but not creepy. Very well done mannequin though.

Yet went through with the whole guns drawn kicking the door in an intimidation tactic to scare him and his family, and any BTC entrepreneur Who wants to be a part of a crypto currency business endeavor. This is bullshit! It's like me trading baseball cards and having the feds break down my door insisting I report my +-$. 




 Janice Dickinson's interview with Nancy Grace was so weird... She was like a non actress trying to act... Wait, she isn't an actress and she is full of shit! Bill Cosby may or may not be a bad dude, but Throw Janice out of the mix. She is an attention hungry ex-model trying to recapture some fame in her golden years, shes 60 and lonely for the public eye.

 That's his point. "Don't park beside me!" He is your a-typical douche who thinks his new, any dad can afford Camaro, is the sweetest thing on the road. Like some others have said, he'll "Car"ate chop someones ankles in a turn or get sick of having to buy new cool guy wheel crap when he scrapes a curb doing 50 and just take up 2-4 slots like the rest of the "I'm better than everyone else" douches of the world. 




 Story time: 
I was a big kid, and now an adult who is smaller, 6'3" 250 range. Big but not a fat ass. Its hard to find friends when you are different "Yuk Yuk Yuk, what are you talking about mate, all Americans are fat! Hahahahahaha", ok are we done?. Anyway I was the nice kid, gentle giant, would help anyone anytime. That's how I was accepted and loved and enjoyed every minute of it with enthusiasm. There was a fella, several but this story is about just one.... Because I annihilated him.... Back to my story, he was about 5' 2" and was semi popular. He would poke and prod at me with chummy vigor. I was the first to make a joke about myself (Fat guy defense) but one day he went a little far. We were in shop class, automotive to be specific, and he decided, while the teacher was downstairs answering a phone call, it was his time to assert dominance over me by belittling me in front of my 20 some odd classmates. He told me to shut up and smacked the back of my head... TRIGGER for me. So I turned around and punched him in the side of the face with not 1 iota of hesitation. Mind you I'm mild mannered. The class had an audible "Gasp!" He looks at me with a look of dumbfound confusion. He decides to go forward so to not loose face, mind you I have over a foot on this guy and 100 lbs. He charges me and punches me in my stomach, (It would be more epic if I laughed) but I did not. I grabbed him around the neck and gave him 9-10 solid punches to the spine. Then I picked him up like the dude in the gif and threw him into an area of empty desks. The desk's went scattering and he was on the floor, he gets up and he was shaking like a leaf, stumbles toward me takes another week swing at me and I grab his hand and say "STOP! If you keep going I am going to kill you.... I don't want to hurt you anymore but I will if you don't go sit the fuck down!". He looks at me walks and picks up a desk and sets it upright and sits down. 10 seconds later the teacher walks in and says "What the hell did I miss?" No-one says anything. He looks at my foe and he is visibly shaking like a chihuahua and asks "Are you okay?" School fight rules in the 90's is you don't tattle, and says "yeah, im fine." Dude didn't talk or fuck with me for the rest of high school. Just to let you younger guys know, just because a guy is big and nice, He is like everyone else and has his limits. Don't Fuck with someone just because you think you can up your reputation, because most of the time, they will surprise you. 




 Oh but tell me you all wouldn't hit that shit. Annoying or not, whatever. She is very cute, and for a big girl she's got the curves in all the correct places.

**Edit:** Sorry for my super white guy wording, I can help what I am. 




 Ouch, the shiny meaty part is what hurts, did it to my toe not to long ago, I kept snagging the damned thing on my socks (Witch hurt a-plenty) so I did Ye Ole' 1----2---3 RIPPPP! lotta-pain-little-time  little-pain-lotta-time. 




 Heres a few tricks I used. Keep a scale in the kitchen. Weigh yourself often. Again it's all mental. Constantly ask yourself why you're depressed, ultimately it comes down to your weight and how you feel physically. To be completely honest it will be one of the hardest things you'll ever do but believe me when I say it's worth it. One sure fire way I use when I am gaining a few lbs is to go Paleo. it's not a diet really because you can eat and eat often if you want. Meats, vegies, fruit and certain oils. It takes a bit for your body to adjust to eating healthy but after a week or two its not even a big deal. Last I did it for 2 months and dropped 20 lbs in about a month 260-240. One thing NEVER do is starve yourself, I tried this and ended up in the hospital for 3 days early on in high school with Gallbladder stones, The doc told me a dramatic drop in weight was to blame. The more often you eat and smaller portions will up your metabolism a whole bunch, I can attest to that. You burn calories as you digest, quite a few too, and if you are constantly digesting you are constantly burning calories. Look into the paleo thing, I liked it because I could eat 2 porkchops for dinner if I wanted and not feel guilty, just no bbq sauce but you can grill pineapple and put some sesame oil on it and it's wonderfull. Good luck. 




 Roughly 375 lbs huh. I weighed exactly that senior year in high-school at 6'3". Got all the way down to 225 then leveled off in the mid 250 range since. You can do it. You will feel amazing. It's hard work.... Really hard. What I did was convince myself food was my enemy (Really it was) and I would only eat enough to keep going. 100 lbs in a year and a girlfriend. Being healthy opens doors my friend, you just have to figure out how to use your key. 




 2 handicap spots... Even in their world there are douchebags. 




 They are pets here in america, It's a cultural thing. I personally would not eat a dog or cat, but if it was life or death and my family needed to eat I wouldn't really have a choice I suppose. I love dogs so this image is disturbing to me. Doesn't mean it's wrong, just disturbing because I have had a few as pets. 




 You use your mouse to control her right hand, you navigate said right hand to apple and click and hold the apple and bring it to her mouth. If you feed her enough apples she gets slightly fatter, and when she gets too fat a mysterious hand comes from behind her and stabs her in the back and releases all the apples you fed her. If you drop the apple out of reach of the fat lady another yet mysterious appendage (A fish netted leg) comes from the other side to kick the apple closer to the fat lady so she can reach it, get her fill, and get stabbed yet once again so she can eat more apples. there is creepy violin music with a little piano playing in the background, real scratchy like, And the artistry is that of a French coffee house drawing.

 Spooky stuff! It's hard to tell these kind of stories because often people don't believe you. I have a friend with a Sasquatch story from when he was like 13 (Were in our 30's now) that he doesn't tell a lot of people for the above reason. But when he tells it you can see in his eyes and paled face that he is not joking. I believe there's some weird stuff out there.  




 This is the correct correction.

 Transport and handling is where the problem lies. Manufacturer-Distributor-Store-customer. It changes hands a minimum of 3 times before you get it. One mistake during the distribution process and your going to have a bad time. 




 Family of Beavs, but a closet Duck fan. Shhh! 




 We have a sysco distribution warehouse here in the beaver state too. Couldn't [Sysco](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view1/3990173/sisqo-o.gif) just stick to his music and not mess with our food :/ 




 Oldish as far as dem innanets go. My first "Online" was a prodigy account my dad had on a 386 with an external modem. After the phone in the carriage thingy but before a 14.4 kbaud. My first online game I ever played was where in the world is Carmen Sandiego and it wasn't multiplayer. So yeah, a little oldish. 




 It's an old gamer tag, I'm oldish (33) and back in the mid 90's you were allotted 8 characters for a username in games like Duke Nukem 3D. so I picked my initials and 3D after my favorite game. Real clever for a 15 year old kid I know, but it stuck. 




 You are correct, Someone corrected me earlier and got downvoted. But everyone keeps telling me its a handlebar mustache so I prematurely typejaculated.   




 Wilsonville right? We just hired a guy from Sysco, but he called in sick too much and was let go. 5 days in 3 months before seniority is too much. He was a fast picker too, nice guy. You might know him. Brett (No last name for internet reasons) 




 I work with some a-holes. But not all of us are bad. A lot of us are family men and pick our kids up from school and go to dinner with our spouses and are just normal folk. But I will agree, there are some grizzly old salts with more than a chip on their shoulder that give "the people in the warehouse" a certain image that might not be so desirable. And me personally don't think I deserve anything more than the next person. 




 Those tubs are used for delivery only, the dry Ice we pack them in only keeps the food to standard temp for like maybe a day, 2 at most if it's winter. But 95% of our frozen food orders are just your standard pallet of frozen food stacked 65 cubes per pallet, then the store puts them in their freezer. We use the Chests and tubs only when the trailer delivering the product's route has a store on they way to their end route. Many factors for using chests and tubs. We try not to use them so much. For routing profitably they are essential. But no, our largest customer is Cash Carry and they never get tubs, they order so much it's profitable to give them the frozen section of the refrigerated trailer. 




 You too. 




 I work at the Milwaukie Oregon based Unified distribution warehouse. But I here stories about the Commerce California distribution center... As well I'm sure they hear stories about us. 




 Believe me when I tell you we have meetings about this kind of stuff. (Keep in mind this pizza did not come from my warehouse) We distribute Totino's, Paul Newman, Amy's frozen pizza and a few others, not Freschetta. But from time to time a new employee or a tired vet lets something slip through the cracks. Oh the Joys of human error. And those pizzas come in boxes of 10 or more, so there are other unhappy customers out there too. 
























 I was 12, and scared like the title suggests. It was 1994, and my father married the love of his life. I was raised Christian and my Father was thrilled to find out that the 2 houses down neighbor woman was his age, single, and christian too. They met at a neighbors house for a neighborhood wine and cheese party (Sounds silly but this is Portland Oregon and this happens...) He dates her for a year or so then they get married, We go to church and everything's great. When they get married they both decide to keep their own houses and split sleep time between the two. Sweet! I think to myself. I had 2 bedrooms and 2 yards to play in, and now a wonderful little sister.

When Linda was here everything was great! We climbed the trees in the backyards, made perfume for her mother out of summer lavender plants, and went to summer camps and all that usual stuff. When she left to go back to her fathers house in Florida after summer ended, things would always turn dark. The light in the house would seem dimmer, sunlight filtration through the windows would be, I don't know, less like light? One particular night I was in "my room" at my step mothers, in the basement also know as the guest room. Do you know what it's like to bite into a real OREO cookie and how familiar and wonderful it tastes? Then eat a Safeway (West coast food store chain) knock off OREO and you can absolutely tell something is different? That is particularly what this night felt like. I was a fan of Archie comics, I was allowed to read until 10 PM on school nights. I was fully into a new Archie double digest when my flipper clock (Anyone over 30 knows what those are) said 10 PM. 

So being the always eager to please youth that I was, I set my comic down and pulled the string on my lamp and made the room dark for sleep. As many kids do, I gave myself a few minutes to reflect and think, I could not get in trouble for being alone with my thoughts, That was my time. About a minute into my contemplation's of the day, week, or whatever, I heard wind. Slow at first, then steadily picking up in sound. I could not feel it necessarily but I could hear it. I thought, "Fine!" no big deal. But when the wind noise stopped with a sudden veracity, followed by a brief audible "Hshhhh"  I got a little scared, hell, I was 12.

As all this is sinking in (Remember it's summer time and outside it's like 65.) I could visibly see my breath, Puff, puff, puff... I reached my  hand into the complete darkness. A blueish white glow surrounded my splayed fingers and The temperature I felt was cooler than a freezer, the light seemed to be flowing around my fingers like petting a passing furry animal, then it was like there was a vacuum that seemed to pull the anomaly into the abyss directly away from my outstretched hand. Wide eyed and scared, I managed to pull the cord on my night light, scared as to what I might see, I still managed to. The lights came on, and the room looked normal. the temperature slowly over the course of a few minutes returned to normal. 

I told nothing of my experience to anyone for a year or so. In 8th grade when I was 13, we were assigned to write a scary story for Halloween. I figured it had been long enough and I was not so frightened by the experience I would write about it. My teacher was really impressed with the imagery I used with words in the story, she read it to the whole class. Everyone told me it was a really good story. I had one friend I trusted. I told him it was true and he looked at me sideways and laughed and said " Sure Mike!" Later I come to find out my stepmother, after the divorce from my very Christian father, was a Luciferian. A tie maybe? I don't know. It is the most real supernatural experience I have personally ever had.  




 AHHH! You're correct! I have forgotten the face of Oy and Jake too. Father Callahan would be disappointed as well if he did not unfortunately meet his end that fateful day at the Dixie Pig. (Spelling is key)

 If you have some bitcoin and some a-hole breaks in and steals your laptop/PC with your main storage wallet you are probably going to notice a computer is gone.

In the mean time you restore your wallet (From an offsite USB) or whatever, transfer to an alternate wallet and change the encryption password.
 




 I have never been hacked, 64 key encryption on my Bitcoin core PC wallet. I have mined on the same PC as my wallet... since 2011. Max coin has been 22 BTC. Why is it that people have been hacked? I have a pc that is only online when I do my transactions that hold my coins. Mining for me now and for the last year is unprofitable. Am I wrong in suggesting that you purchase coins on one.. Boot "ye old PC" and transfer real quick, wait for confirmation and then shut down "ye old PC"? Its worked for me maybe you have an old laptop and only use it for BTC stuff. 




 Ya' know... I just love [Randy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG0mINiY3pw), That is all. 









 Very low noise, the only moving parts are the fans 1 tiny cpu fan (it's an am1I mobo with a 2.1 ghz quadcore cpu) solid state drive. 




 Crazy small world lol. We'll hang out soon. 




 Thanks for the detailed response. 




 Thank you. 2 on the left are pulling out, one one the right pulling in. Max temp stress test was 66 degrees f. 




 Ha, I didnt even notice he was there until I looked at the picture later. 




 The 2 on the right are pulling out from the case directly next to the motherboard.  The one on the left is pulling in fresh air. I would have put 2 but the power supply is in the way. If heat was a problem after my stress test I would have ordered a higher  CFM fan. Max temp at full 1080p for 2 hours it only got to 66 degrees f. With an ambient temp of 65 f. 









 Arent girls buttoned shirts opposite of guys too? 




 Good observation. Have you tried to put your belt on the other direction? I feels wrong. Like throwing with your left hand if you're a righty. 




 This is a very good description, it's spot on. Bravo good sir! 




 I brew often(30 or so gallons last year), My highest yield was 10% ABV. A delicious Rye IPA. From what I understand more sugar more potential alcohol. [This guy](http://byo.com/boiling/item/51-21-alcohol-all-grain-beer) has a 21.4 ABV by his readings and he uses some pretty wonky methods I am not familiar with (I am not an aficionado) But it seems he pumps o2 into the fermentor with a welding tank... This is neat to me. I might have to try a super ABV beer for fun. 




 It's all good, maybe it came off as snarky. Was meant to be silly. Oh well cant win them all. 




 You spelled racecar backwards, don't believe me? check! 




 Dammit! I clicked through so many of those pictures and had to back button a super whole bunch. Now I have a new weird scary-tall chick fetish... Thanks! 




 I own one (Not the jacked one on a Chevy truck frame with a 350), in perfect condition. They rival the Prius without the douchebagery. Easy to work on yourself and extremely inexpensive. A header [(Which they sell)](http://www.pt2w.com/srd/index.php?main_page=product_info products_id=100 zenid=5cim64u09uuooi7j5vib2robj1), a K N air filter and an MSD ignition plus a few others, and you have a fine running machine. It's not as slow as you think at only 1,800 lbs with mods and 70-80 HP.

 Came here to link this, you beat me to it. Have an upvote. 




 He didn't claim original content, I think it's ok for him to re-post. Plus the other one got no love. This one has got a little love at least. And Hell yeah! Grandma shit rocks! 




 Way to be a dick. How did it work for ya? 




 This is a smart joke to make smart people feel smart! Smart asses!
