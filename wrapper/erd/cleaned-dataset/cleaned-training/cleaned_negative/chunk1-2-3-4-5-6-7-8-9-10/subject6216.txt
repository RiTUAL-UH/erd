 I have update my original post. After researching a little bit further, chromebook is definitely the best option where cost is an issue. 




 *Much giggles ensue after Jen leaves the room in a daze* 




 Would a chromebook be able to utilize the program Scrivener. Its the program I use the most when I'm setting up projects. I know it works on windows and Macs but I haven't looked into chromebooks to know if it would also work on those 




 Before I went back on the mood stabilizers, I wasn't quite so tired all the time. Now adding im having to take birth control after a surgery, its zapped what little extra energy I had to do anything.Im not exactly depressed, at least not all of the time. Mostly just mood-swinging from my body trying to get used to the new hormones being forced on it. Knowing where the mood swings are coming from doesn't always help though.

Has anyone had luck with vitamins for helping to mellow you out? Or any kind of natural supplement? Caffine makes me too jittery to really be an option 




 This seems to happen to me too. If Ive been stressed and anxious all day, I day dream about getting home just so I can go to bed 









 EDIT UPDATE : I believe I have decided to go with a Chromebook after reading an article a guy had wrote who also loved loves the Scrivener program. I will still definitely be emailing the Scrivener team to check into making an app that would work with Chromebook but I will research utilizing Google Docs for now.

If anyone else is having the same issue, here is the article that changed my mind:

Original Post:
I don't have the money yet but I want to plan out what some of my best options are . Looking for my most portable option for writing. I will need the internet for research as well.

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

 

* Country of purchase:
United States of America
 

* Budget range:
Under $300  *hopefully*
 

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.)

I need it to be as ultraportable as possible. I want to be able to take it everywhere. I am in desperate need of a way to write on the go. I type fast and prefer it to writing by hand.
 

* Screen size preference:
Around 14" or less, I want a small size for portability
 

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux):

 I prefer windows. Have not had a lot of experience with Mac systems

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings):

 This laptop won't be for gaming. Ill just need to be able to do research on the internet.

* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.):

 I would like a fairly good wireless card installed. I do a lot of research on web in  lot of different areas. Right now all of it is done from my phone.

* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support):

 Google. Im fairly good with computers. Just looking for suggestions here. Laptops are not my specialty

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business

compatibility):

 Open to suggestions.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great):

 Just looking for something portable

* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)

 

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight:

 Low weight

* Build quality -vs- Low price:

 Maybe a little in between? I dont want it to break immediately

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance:

 Low noise would be nice

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

 There aren't really any extra features I want

* High resolution screen:

 Doesn't matter

* A great keyboard:

 The keyboard is pretty important. It will be used quite a bit

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons:

 I usually plug in a mouse. I've never liked touchpads

* Great audio:

 Doesn't matter

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy sjcreen, matte screen, etc.)

A screen that doesn't glare easy would be nice but not if it hikes the price too much. I need a few usb ports for a mouse and flashdrives. 




 I sold my 3DS to help with rent a little over a month ago and then Fantasy Life came out and I realized I missed Animal Crossing too so I scrounged to buy for a 2ds :/ and lost all my progress on my games. You'll end up wanting it back, trust me. 




 Perhaps they will consider bringing the abrasiveness back to some of the characters in another installment then. Either way, it makes no difference to me, the thing I like most about the game is collecting items and decorating and interacting online with people. I rarely have the music turned up 




 I remember my nephew complain about how long Resetti's rant was going on. I can understand why this happened. It is after all, supposed to be more geared toward children. 
























 I think I was originally thinking more along the lines of naturally occurring portals, I guess almost like rifts? I don't know why I didn't just think of movement as being a factor.  
  
I wasn't really thinking telepathy. To me, telepathy is like mind-reading or speaking mind to mind. I was thinking of a certain percentage of people being able to see higher level vibrations, which is where the other dimension would be located. Right on top of our own dimension, but vibrating at a higher frequency than our own. So these people that have this ability would be able to pass between the dimensions, and certain points, or portals, would be easier to pass through. The more people in an area that have this ability could change the properties of the portal points to where they begin transporting living or moving things between worlds. I was also thinking that people without the ability to see these higher frequencies wouldn't have been able to see the dragon, for example, only the fire that it created perhaps.  
  
I wanted the other dimension to be different. How we rely on technology for things like communication or weapons for example, would be different on their side. They would be able to interact differently with elements in their world. So their rods could be of a special metal that allowed them to bend natural magnetic fields (or something along those lines) to form a sort of shield, or even containment field. They wouldn't be able to do this without those rods. The way they lived would seem almost simple to someone from our world because they wouldn't need the same technology that we do to accomplish things. That sounds vague, I know, I just haven't thought it all the way through yet.  

I agree that I need to do better with the showing more than telling. Work has decided that its going to deny that link so I'll check it out when I get home. It definitely isn't my goal to make humans seem barbaric in the least, just that the visitors treat them that way.  
  
I don't want the Centauri people to be more defined until later in the story, I was thinking of purposefully only showing one kind of people from their world so the humans view of them would be sort of warped until a later time. So what they would be seeing was a militant group of individual and wrongly assume that the entire population of the dimension was aggressive, abrasive or snobbish.  
  
I'm not sure I want them to be biologically human but I'll have to read more about where a good point would be to dissect their evolutionary paths. I do want them to come from the same basic ancestor I believe, but have grown in different ways and abilities.  
  
I have a lot to think about. I wanted these ideas before I continued writing on this piece, figured it would be less rewriting in the end, which I am not a fan of. This is really good. 




 Thank you.  
  
I actually was thinking of having the dragon wander in from an opening without consciously trying but I don't know if I want inanimate things coming through too, like crashing together. It was my original thought to put more explanation into it that the "will" was simply wanting to be a different place than it already was. Not specifically another dimension. Ill have to rewrite that bit.  
  
I had to google psionics, I wasn't already familiar with the term but it sounds like maybe thats a bit of personal taste. I personally love the idea of what the brain could be capable of with evolutional or manipulation, etc. I do intend to include more tech, but most of the thigs I like to read are more based around what you probably think of as psionics. I will have to branch out and read some more variety to understand how I can best fit technology in with my idea. But I do agree that it would make the story more interesting.  
  
I also want to explore what makes the cultures each feel that they are more superior to one another, what skills make them different, but perhaps that bit just needs to be rewritten as well. I don't feel that either of these cultures are better than the other, but they will be very different, and I personally like exploring cultural conflict. In the end, I want an event that makes them band together in order to save both their people but I don't want them seeing eye to eye at the start and that usually seems to come from people believing they are better than someone else. Exploring where their pathes diverged though would be interesting, being overlapping dimensions I did want a few similarities. Ill have to think more on it.  
  
I definitely appreciate your feedback.

Looking for feedback on whether to continue. Does it sound like an interesting read? Is there a specific direction you think would be really interesting for this tidbit to go in? How is my writing?

I've just decided I should let others read some of my writing to get some idea of where I want to go with it. And I didn't know the best place to start getting feedback so this is my first attempt.

I choose a writing prompt to work with daily and I kind of liked where this one was going.
  
Any helpful comments are welcome! Please also comment here if you comment on the actual document so I know to go look. If there are specific websites you use to get good feedback on your writing, I would appreciate it if you dropped me a comment on that as well. Thank you  
  
**Edit**: I rewrote portions, so the word count is now 564. 




 The men that held back the crowd were a mixture of army reserve from this world and officers from Centauris dimensional patrol. They were all clearly uncomfortable standing between a mob and a giant lizard, but the men from Centauri looked like they felt far more prepared to handle the situation. These officers held simple metal-like rods that seemed almost nonthreatening next to the armys security shields and guns. I knew they still had every reason to feel complete confidence amongst this worlds inhabitants. They were endowed with mental abilities that most of us could only dream of.
  
The beast gave a throaty challenge that was more of a deep rumbling moan than a roar as it continued waddling towards the Yellowstone caldera. It had the coloring of light gray ash one would see with the remains of a dead camp fire. Many people from our world called these creatures dragons. I doubted that the people of Centauri identified them with that term but they had never corrected us. To their more refined culture, we were bumbling invaders who were slightly barbaric in nature. With that said, they were not forth-coming about life on the other side of the dimensional veil.  
  
Centauri was not even the true name of their home world, that too was denied to us. Most of Earths leading government officials involved with our new visitors had agreed upon Centauri, being the name of our dimensions closest cluster of stars to the sun, and their dimension being the closest one to ours that we knew of. It almost overlapped our own, and it seemed that anything living on the Centaurian side (with the will to do so) could now pass through the veil. The dragon clearly had had the will to push itself through and now was in a state of confusion.  
  
The men did not allow the crowd to move forward as the dragon relocated away from the commotion we were creating. It lumbered towards an active geyser and stuck its head inside the spray. After adding more deep grumbling noises, it moved its whole body across the opening of the geyser and settled itself down, head resting on massive claws. It belched flame tendrils which caught on a close clump of grass but made no move to evacuate as more of the plant-covered area caught fire. The volume of conversation rose among the crowd as we watched. The patch was too secluded from others to cause much worry, but anxious questions flowed from the watchers. *What else could it do? And where was it going?* 




 Thank you. I wish I could stick with one idea longer lol 




 Leaving one world for the next is a thing partly of the mind and a little of placing. A door, as it might be thought of, could be located anywhere. The final part of our ascension comes when we both locate a door and push ourselves through. A door could sit on a beach, in a cave or even in mid-air. A being can access these doors once specific credentials have been met. The credentials can be anything from having specific strands of DNA to surpassing a specific level of spiritual growth. Once the credentials have been met, the correct frame of mind is needed to utilize the door. This state cannot be described, it can only be known and felt by those individuals who possess the traits needed to pass through to a place on the other side.

Looking for a little feedback so I decided to post this in a few places.  
  
Does it sound like an interesting read? Is there a specific direction you think would be really interesting for this tidbit to go in? How is my writing?  
  
Any helpful comments are welcome! Please also comment here if you comment on the actual document so I know to go look. If there are specific websites you use to get good feedback on your writing, I would appreciate it if you dropped me a comment on that as well. Thank you  




 I rewrote some things, check it out when you get the chance if you would.  
  
I took your advice on leaving the portals visible but low profile and not having things have to will themselves through to the other side. Hopefully I did a better job of making it seem less like the humans were inferior to the visitors and more like the visitors simply acted that way.  




 Its helpful to hear others understand and have similar reactions and bad habits.  
  
What my friend came up with was a sort of system she uses to keep from being lazy. She told me if she puts off doing the dishes one day for example, she would clean the whole kitchen the next day. She thinks it might be helpful to me to turn around and do something nice for the person I snapped at or didn't listen to. It might eventually make me think before I react because I'm also sort of shy and don't like being forced to interact more than I need to with a lot of people. Its a good thought, but I'll have to see if I can stick with it. I also suffer from being slightly pessimistic so its difficult to stay hopeful, lol. 




 I seem to be so worried all the time that people are not thinking that I'm good enough for one reason or another that my reaction to any kind of criticism is to become incredibly defensive, even if people are just trying to help. I know that this is not helpful at all. I can look back on situations and see that I reacted badly and I know that staying calm would help me a great deal in future situations, but I just can't seem to manage it and that is infuriating. Especially when I'm at work where a professional attitude is a necessity. Or when a good friend is just trying to help me see how to do something a different way than what I'm used to and may not even be telling me that I'm doing anything wrong. 

I have tendencies towards obsessive behavior and I'm starting to wonder if these kinds of reactions are another form of this. A lot of times when I am stressed out, I end up in trance-like state and pick at my skin until it just looks terrible. I haven't been able to change this habit either, only lessen the amount of damage for some periods of time. It never sticks though. 

I wish I could be more calm and change these terrible habits. They have become almost daily issues that I have to deal with and it is absolutely draining.

 I agree!! I just want to squish that cute little face!! :)   
























 I haven't thought about getting help before because just as you said, I didn't even believe I had an addiction problem. Then my boyfriend asked me not to take the pills one night so we could have "cuddle time" (sorry, maybe too much info there) and I panicked because I didn't think I could handle being swamped with my thoughts right then. I'm thinking I probably should try to talk to someone  




 Thanks for the info. The only kind of support group type settings I've been in were enforced anger management groups when I was in high school. NA sounds a bit more accepting 




 This post will probably be a bit of a mess.  
  
Over the past couple of months I've started to realize that I'm relying too much on my pain medication to get me through days that I'm not having problems with my condition that I'm prescribed it for. I would like to stop using it altogether and try other pain management things but right now I'm too afraid that trying to do that will topple this proverbial card house that I've built. Nothing feels stable.  
  
I'm only 23 but it still worries me that I have no real direction in my life. My job is not a bad one but there is no option for moving up in the company from my position. I have just barely enough money to scrape by each month if I'm actually being responsible and most months I don't even make my student loan payment. I filed bankruptcy a few months ago and now I worry if anything happens to my car I won't be able to get another one. I have severe anxiety that I take medication for that tends to make me sleepy a lot so my energy level is almost a non-existent sliver on a graph. I think this makes me feel like a don't have the will to change things a lot of the time because I'm just too tired.  
  
I know my pills aren't really helping anything. They are supposed to be there for when my endometriosis symptoms flare up and I absolutely have to have something. But I'm taking them four or more times a week and have to really try hard not to take them more just because I'm having problems dealing with things in other areas of my life.  
  
I'm sure counseling might help but I'm too afraid that I really can't afford $50 just to go talk to someone for an hour. I was thinking about going to an NA meeting but I get anxious around groups of people larger than 3-ish and I feel like they might realize I'm not really ready to quit yet and call me out on it. I really wish I had a better support system. I do have my best friend, we are close and have been for about 13 years but she also struggles with things that make me worry about putting any more on her shoulders. I also have my boyfriend but we have only been dating for a little over 5 months and I worry about telling him how unstable I really feel. I'm not close with my family at all.  
  
I'm just not sure where to start making changes in my life and I'm afraid of trying to give up the one thing that helps me get through bad days with everything else I'm supposed to be dealing with.  
  
:(  
  
Needless to say, I'm having a bit of a rough day. 




 I really like reeblebeeble's reply.  
  
I would highly suggest if you aren't already taking a daily vitamin, definitely do so. I take medication for acute anxiety and I often make myself a bit sick with my worry and forget to make myself eat right. The vitamin helps me get the things my body needs to run that I otherwise wouldn't get. A car can't run without fuel, and neither can our bodies. I think its just like reeble said, there isn't really a magic formula, all the little bits of advice will help add up to a bigger solution 




 I was just thinking that! 




 I just want to squish his little face!!! Adorable :)  




 Oh dear, that's an interesting reason for the collapse of the web. They definitely made sure we wouldn't joke about killing their baby-faced dictator again, now didn't they? Thanks for your reply! 




 So it has come to this? 0.0' Your body was among thousands of others found alone in their homes by looters scavenging for supplies. An eerie reminder of the connections between each other that were lost in the internet age. Thanks for your reply! 




 Oh woe is us! Will we never know of this interesting prompt you thought of?? Thanks for your reply! 




 Hopefully Jerry was more appreciated at his new job!! Great submission by the way, I enjoyed reading it 
























 I love them!!  :) 




 I have thought about meditation before, just haven't been sure about the best way to go about doing it. My mind is so loud and always worrying about something. It has been suggested to me before though 




 Your completely right. Finding out someone you really care about maybe doesn't care about you as much is something I'm not sure I can handle right now lol. But in time I hope I find my true friends too 




 Thank you 




 I'm hoping I'll be able to make a few acquaintances like that if I go to a meeting. I don't want to talk to anyone that I care about losing on the topic of what a piece of shit I am 




 She never offers me anything and just sticks to her tabs which I'm allergic to so she isn't bringing anything in the house that I would want. Neither of us is good at dealing with stress is where the problem comes in. She's amazing to talk to and always listens so she really is a good friend. She's also my roommate lol. I'm going to really try. If I talk to my doctor it will cut my main source off, that will do wonders for my effort in quitting I'm sure 




 Thank you for your time though, I appreciate hearing from an outside person on this. I don't tell my boyfriend about the extent of the issue, and my best friend has even more of a problem with it than I do 




 I've had a lot of anxiety sense I was about 13, mostly due to a crappy home life. The days I don't take the pills I feel like I need to smoke, or drink, and I hate liquor and never liked myself when I smoked bud before this. I know its a problem. I'm just hoping the more I hear things like this, the more it will wedge itself in my brain. Along with the anxiety, I also have obsessive tendencies so breaking habits is one of the hardest things for me to do, I've even been hospitalized for my obsessive skin picking when it caused a staff infection and I still pick at my skin. I'm going to really try to find another alternative for pain management and I hope I'll be brave enough to talk to my doctor about my fear that I probably shouldn't be taking these pills. Its hard to breathe just thinking about doing that 




 Really sorry for using you, a complete stranger, as a sounding board  .  I just don't have anyone else at the moment 




 Its also difficult to make myself do something about it when I feel like I'm functioning better when I take the pills. I talk to people and I'm more friendly. And its the only way I get motivated to do anything. I'll actually get up and clean the house for example and I feel like writing again, which I used to love to do but lost all motivation for. I don't want to lose my motivation and I feel like I only have it when I'm taking the pills. Its really scary for me to think about 
























 My friend wants a specific discontinued bath and body works lotion for her Birthday. Breathe Romance. They are super expensive on ebay and I was wondering if there was a good subreddit that I could post and maybe buy a partly used bottle of this stuff for a little cheaper 




 That really does sound lovely. Our weather isn't cooperating at the moment but I appreciate the thought, Thank you 




 Your thoughtfulness is very much appreciated and unexpected, thank you. I sent you a message and can't say how nice it was to receive this one 




 I'm requesting healing and supportive thoughts be sent my way. I'm a strong believer in the power of positive thinking but have not been able to manage it for myself lately. I'll attach a picture and tell a little bit about my situation if that will help any of you focus your intentions.  
  
[Picture](http://imgur.com/SFBN2XA)
  
I am a 23 year old female living in Oklahoma. A little over a month ago, I was released from the hospital after spending a week in inpatient while they switched my medication around. In the past, I've been diagnosed with something called Borderline Personality disorder, which basically means I have trouble controlling my emotions, especially the intense ones. I ended up in the hospital after breaking it off with my then significant other. Even though this was my choice, it left me feeling out of control and a risk to myself.  
  
Sense being released, I have been physically ill for most of the time and am just now starting to feel like I'm close to getting well. I have had strep, a flu bug and an infection over the course of this last month and am absolutely drained. The people at my job, which I have been at for 7 months, really seem to like me a lot but I know my having to be out for the few days that I had to go to the doctor on top of being out for a week in the hospital have put a strain on things here and I'm not exactly viewed as the most reliable person anymore. My worrying over this has also caused me to lose some much needed focus on my tasks.  
  
I take naps immediately after I get home from work every day and I know it is worrying my roommate, but I am just so tired all the time that I can't help it.  
  
I miss having energy and motivation to do things. I miss being reliable at work. I hate feeling lonely all the time and doing dumb impulsive things in attempt to put a proverbial bandage over that feeling.  
  
I have just completed my orientation process for volunteering a couple shifts each week at the children's hospital and I'm really hoping my severe lack of energy doesn't effect my ability to complete these shifts. Its so important to me to be able to have some kind of interaction with people.  
  
I could really use positive, encouraging and healing thoughts being sent my way. 














 I don't have a therapist I see anymore, haven't had one for about 3 years. I have decided there isnt much more I can do other than check myself in. Im trying to work up the courage to go but Im really scared. I dont like not knowing how long theyll keep me for 




 This will be a messy post, I'm sure.  
Running on very little sleep the past few days.

Where to start.. Maybe a little about myself. I'm a 24 year old female. Friday night my significant other decided to break off our relationship. Needless to say this was upsetting, though it wasn't really the problem. The problem is I've been using the relationship as a sort of bandage to cover up numerous insecurities and phobias. Now that its gone, there is nothing holding back the floodgates in my head. Word vomit is spinning in circles around my mind and driving me crazy for lack of a better term. What seems to help quiet the noise in my head is interacting with other people and pacing or doing another activity that requires use of my, at the moment, very limited supply of energy. Friday night, or Saturday morning I should probably say, I couldn't get to sleep until around 5 am when I passed out from pure exhaustion. I woke up a little under two hours later after a terrible nightmare and couldn't go back to sleep. I spent the rest of the morning quietly pacing the house and shaking from the effort until my roommate woke up and we could start our day. Now its 2 am on Sunday and I'm so very tired that its making me sick. I'm hungry too but I'm fairly sure if I eat I'll throw up. I seem to have terrible nightmares when I'm stressed and after last night I'm not really eager to do a repeat. But I desperately need to sleep. When I lay down I can't stop the spiral of thoughts from crashing down on me so I started just kind of rocking back and forth and petting my dog, trying really hard to not think about anything at all.  
  
It occurs to me now that its highly doubtful I can function like this at work on Monday, having what will probably be a total of only 4 hours of sleep in a 72 ish hour period. I feel like my body is already trying to shut down. But if I don't go to work then I will need a damn good excuse. At this point, the only thing I can come up with is going to admit myself to the hospital. Which might not be such a bad idea given my mental state, but I'm absolutely terrified of the place.  
  
I had to spend a week in the psychiatric ward about 4 years ago and over half that week was not voluntary. The doctors were not friendly and most of the other patients either annoyed or scared me. Participating in the group activities was very difficult because I'm extremely shy, which made me seem even more difficult to the doctors, who subsequently liked me even less. I could tell I was frustrating them because all I wanted to do was sleep and pace around my room until they fixed my medication to their liking and I could leave. They didn't think fixing my medication was good enough so I asked to leave at which point I was told that I would then be held involuntarily and would end up needing a court order to leave and spend a minimum of 30 days there if I didn't calm down. At that point I became extremely claustrophobic and panicked and spent a day refusing to talk to anyone. They chalked this behavior up to a bad reaction to a new medication they had just tried to switch me to and switch me to something else. Things did get a little better from there but the facility was still very daunting. The sheets were not comfortable to sleep on and having someone come in to my room every hour wore on my nerves to the point where I broke a few times and told them to get out. I try very hard to always be polite and not throw fits like that but to me this hospital environment was truly terrible and I wanted desperately to go home the whole time. Most of the books I asked to be brought I wasn't even allowed to read because they were science fiction and the doctors said that they would encourage some delusions.  
  
I'm not anxious to go back to this hospital for any kind of mental condition. The thought absolutely terrifies me. So does the thought of losing my job and not being able to pay my bills.  
  
I believe if I do admit myself to the hospital, my job cannot legally fire me and likely wouldn't because they do sincerely seem to like me. I've only been at this place for 6 months and already had to miss two days from two separate episodes of strep throat. I hate missing work. I want them to see me as reliable. I'm only a temp and not hired on permanently yet so I'm worried too that if the hospital kept me too long, they could let me go anyways simply because I am only there on a temp basis right now and they don't need a valid reason.  
  
I could try and go to work Monday, but I'm already cringing at the thought. I'm shaking from lack of sleep and trying to exert to much energy today. and I'm physically sick from not being able to eat enough. I feel like throwing up and have a terrible headache from crying and having a little panic attack (at least I think that's what it was, I've never had one of those before).  
  
I work in a cubicle doing data entry. The work is very repetitive and will allow me too much time to dwell on things that I really don't need to be thinking about right now. Which will likely just make me cry and then panic because I can't stop crying and I'd be too near people that they might hear. Talking about my diminished mental state with any of my coworkers is not something I want to do. I do not want to seem mentally unfit in anyway to my boss. I cannot afford to lose this job.  
  
So I am caught between a rock and a very hard place. Going to the hospital would be terrifying and I don't want to do that. Going to work in this state is also equally undesirable.  
  
I am not sure what to do. 




 This will be a messy post, I'm sure.  
Running on very little sleep the past few days.

Where to start.. Maybe a little about myself. I'm a 24 year old female. Friday night my significant other decided to break off our relationship. Needless to say this was upsetting, though it wasn't really the problem. The problem is I've been using the relationship as a sort of bandage to cover up numerous insecurities and phobias. Now that its gone, there is nothing holding back the floodgates in my head. Word vomit is spinning in circles around my mind and driving me crazy for lack of a better term. What seems to help quiet the noise in my head is interacting with other people and pacing or doing another activity that requires use of my, at the moment, very limited supply of energy. Friday night, or Saturday morning I should probably say, I couldn't get to sleep until around 5 am when I passed out from pure exhaustion. I woke up a little under two hours later after a terrible nightmare and couldn't go back to sleep. I spent the rest of the morning quietly pacing the house and shaking from the effort until my roommate woke up and we could start our day. Now its 2 am on Sunday and I'm so very tired that its making me sick. I'm hungry too but I'm fairly sure if I eat I'll throw up. I seem to have terrible nightmares when I'm stressed and after last night I'm not really eager to do a repeat. But I desperately need to sleep. When I lay down I can't stop the spiral of thoughts from crashing down on me so I started just kind of rocking back and forth and petting my dog, trying really hard to not think about anything at all.  
  
It occurs to me now that its highly doubtful I can function like this at work on Monday, having what will probably be a total of only 4 hours of sleep in a 72 ish hour period. I feel like my body is already trying to shut down. But if I don't go to work then I will need a damn good excuse. At this point, the only thing I can come up with is going to admit myself to the hospital. Which might not be such a bad idea given my mental state, but I'm absolutely terrified of the place.  
  
I had to spend a week in the psychiatric ward about 4 years ago and over half that week was not voluntary. The doctors were not friendly and most of the other patients either annoyed or scared me. Participating in the group activities was very difficult because I'm extremely shy, which made me seem even more difficult to the doctors, who subsequently liked me even less. I could tell I was frustrating them because all I wanted to do was sleep and pace around my room until they fixed my medication to their liking and I could leave. They didn't think fixing my medication was good enough so I asked to leave at which point I was told that I would then be held involuntarily and would end up needing a court order to leave and spend a minimum of 30 days there if I didn't calm down. At that point I became extremely claustrophobic and panicked and spent a day refusing to talk to anyone. They chalked this behavior up to a bad reaction to a new medication they had just tried to switch me to and switch me to something else. Things did get a little better from there but the facility was still very daunting. The sheets were not comfortable to sleep on and having someone come in to my room every hour wore on my nerves to the point where I broke a few times and told them to get out. I try very hard to always be polite and not throw fits like that but to me this hospital environment was truly terrible and I wanted desperately to go home the whole time. Most of the books I asked to be brought I wasn't even allowed to read because they were science fiction and the doctors said that they would encourage some delusions.  
  
I'm not anxious to go back to this hospital for any kind of mental condition. The thought absolutely terrifies me. So does the thought of losing my job and not being able to pay my bills.  
  
I believe if I do admit myself to the hospital, my job cannot legally fire me and likely wouldn't because they do sincerely seem to like me. I've only been at this place for 6 months and already had to miss two days from two separate episodes of strep throat. I hate missing work. I want them to see me as reliable. I'm only a temp and not hired on permanently yet so I'm worried too that if the hospital kept me too long, they could let me go anyways simply because I am only there on a temp basis right now and they don't need a valid reason.  
  
I could try and go to work Monday, but I'm already cringing at the thought. I'm shaking from lack of sleep and trying to exert to much energy today. and I'm physically sick from not being able to eat enough. I feel like throwing up and have a terrible headache from crying and having a little panic attack (at least I think that's what it was, I've never had one of those before).  
  
I work in a cubicle doing data entry. The work is very repetitive and will allow me too much time to dwell on things that I really don't need to be thinking about right now. Which will likely just make me cry and then panic because I can't stop crying and I'd be too near people that they might hear. Talking about my diminished mental state with any of my coworkers is not something I want to do. I do not want to seem mentally unfit in anyway to my boss. I cannot afford to lose this job.  
  
So I am caught between a rock and a very hard place. Going to the hospital would be terrifying and I don't want to do that. Going to work in this state is also equally undesirable.  
  
I am not sure what to do. 
  
And because I feel like I'm out of plausible options, I'm ready to be done with everything. 




 Last nights dream was just weird. And scary. I'm not religious and while I do have nightmares a couple times a week (I usually give my anxious mind credit for these) I can usually see why I might be dreaming of a certain thing. But I was feeling pretty good when I went to sleep last night. And it was the most sleep I had gotten in a couple of days so it should have felt good. I have never dreamed of anything like this before. My dreams/nightmares usually have reoccurring themes like zombies, falling from a high place, seeing people I know or things like that so this is quite perplexing to me.

What I remember is being in a dark cavern like place with glowing veins of red running through the rocks, lava maybe. There were thousand of "demons" around me. That's the only way I would describe them. I woke up immediately knowing that. They all looked different. There were no people around, just me and the demons. And a couple of them were trying to communicate with me, to get me to attack or defend myself from others. I got the feeling that I was probably demonic too. We were floating in the cavern, like there was no gravity, but they didn't need it and moved freely in any direction. At one point I was running or fleeing from a group of them. Then after prodding from a few of them, I set thousands of other demons on fire that were surrounding my small group, using my mind.

I have no idea what to make of the dream/nightmare. It was definitely very unsettling. 





























 I'm looking to stock up on this stuff so if anyone else sees this and has some used or unused bottles, please let me know!!  
I can't believe how helpful people on reddit have been  :)   you guys are awesome 




 Yes!! Thats exactly what Im looking for!! :)  
I will happily get you $5. Do you have paypal? I'm not sure the best way to get you the money but I will message you.  
I'm completely ok with the bottle not being completely full. We know how difficult these are to find and shes just going to be excited to get it! :) 




 Not sure if this is the best subreddit.
I'm looking for a discontinued lotion from bath and body works called Breathe Romance. My friend wants it for her Birthday but I can't do $60 a bottle. I was hoping an awesome person on Reddit here would sell me a partially used bottle for a little cheaper.  
  
Please let me know if you guys have any ideas!!! My friend really loves this lotion 




 Ill take a look at that subreddit as well, Thank you 




 Bath   Body Works Breathe Romance 24/7 Moisture Boost Body Lotion - Sensuous Amber Myrrh 8.4 fl oz.

So something close Amber Myrrh maybe? 




 Does anyone remember the Breathe Romance collection from bath and body works? Its been discontiued for a few years and my friend was really wanting it for her birthday. I really didn't want to do the $60 on ebay for a small bottle :/  
  
Do you know of a scent that would be really similar to this lotion? Preferably also in another lotion 









 Thank you, Ill try posting there as well 




 Thanks!  
























 Lol yes :p   she's my baby and is quite adored so I felt the need to make sure everyone saw her beautiful side too  . 




 Lol thank you. Sorry, for being defensive. The little pugbutt is my world 




 I'm sure they don't like you either.. 




 [This picture was taken this morning](http://imgur.com/TWY9EWT)  
  
She may be stocky but she isn't super fat 




 [Still think so?](http://imgur.com/TWY9EWT)  
  
She is just stocky 




 [Seriously not obese](http://imgur.com/TWY9EWT) 




 She isn't. She just scrunched herself back to sneeze.. Shes walked twice a day and runs around in the back yard and is only fed 2/3's of a cup of kibble twice a day... 




 Have you been around pugs much?  




 She gets 2/3 cup of food in the morning and at night. She is not overfed. Just a pug 




 Didn't know about that one lol. I think I shall repost this over there   :)  thank you. People must view the silly pug 
























 Awesome seller  :)  she had a bottle of super hard to find lotion that she sent me just a few days after I got her the shipping payment and added a few other goodies too 




 This sweet person sent me a box filled with cookies and candy and other little goodies that made my day so much better :)  she saw that I was having a rough time in a post last week and wanted to help me feel better and her mission was certainly accomplished!! Each little gift inside the box was individually wrapped and she even sent a handmade card  ^-^  its so good to know that there are people out there will to show that they care for others, even if they have never met them before.

 I'm a 24 year old female, with an associates in English and a job that I've had for 8 months that pays $13 an hour doing data-entry. In September I filed for Bankruptcy so getting a loan isn't an option. After my bills and other payments are made for the month, I usually have about $250 left over.  
  
I really want to get out and see different places in the world, even if they're just an hour away from my city in Oklahoma. I'm feeling trapped by my lack of funds though. I can count the number of times I've been out of state for more than an hour or two at a time on one hand.  
  
I want to go climbing in caverns and hiking on mountain trails. I want to eat pizza in New York and watch the sunset on a beach. I want to swim in the ocean and see a real archaeological dig site. I want to see new places and do new things that I will never have a chance to do here in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  
  
I want to do these things but I don't even know where to start. I'm 5 ft and 100 lbs and that has always made me wonder if I would be alright traveling alone, being so tiny. I'm used to being responsible and I like knowing that I'll a safe place to sleep at night so the wandering lifestyle just isn't for me. I feel like only a real stroke of luck will get me out of town, even if it is just briefly. I know people must venture to new areas all the time though.  
  
I need advice!!  
  
  
**I may cross-post this in another sub if it's suggested so please don't downvote for that reason :)
  
 




 I would love it if a kind person would do a reading for me. I am extremely confused by the current obstacles in my life.  
  
It isn't that I don't believe in coincidences but for the past month now, every time a try to go on a date, something happens that makes either me or the other person have to cancel their plans. After it happened again tonight I have become so frustrated. I firmly believe that life or some other force is trying to tell me something or point me in a certain direction but I am just being to dense to pick up on any clues other than I am supposed to be alone for the time being. Great, fine. I wish I knew what other direction I should be focusing my attentions instead.  
  
A little about me if it is helpful for your reading: I am a 24 year old woman. I have a steady job that really doesn't have an option for me to make a career out of it. I'm a pretty good writer but I've never focused on it as a life goal. I recently put in an application to be a volunteer at the local childrens hospital and just finished the interview process and should be starting my shifts soon there.  
  
I would be ever so greatful if someone would be willing to try seeking a little insight on what direction would be best for me to head in. I'm quite lost when I don't have a plan and I don't even know where to start right now 




 Aw thank you  :) 




 Yeah I probably need to work on this more. I have a lot of angry impulses. Sometimes I don't realize I'm in an angry rage spiral until someone is like "Why did that make you so angry?" and then I just feel retarded 




 I really do need to take time out each day to focus on this more. Instead of when I'm already laying down in bed and likely to fall asleep 




 I'm in the process of trying to get my brain to realize this now  :/  I keep thinking that as long as I allow these negative thoughts to keep running through my mind, I'm going to keep attracting unfavorable situations. Its becoming quite frustrating. Hence this post, lol 




 Feel free to link any helpful articles too!! 




 Que over-protective pug mom defending her baby's honor  :p 
























 I don't need to, but at some point I really would like to have a child. My family life was crappy growing up and I always wanted to have my own that was better than what I had in the past. 




 I've been diagnosed with borderline personality. I know the state of my emotions changes in the blink of an eye sometimes. But then there's times like now that I just stay mostly sad and a little impulsive for weeks at a time.  
  
My impulsive behavior hurts the few relationships that I have with close friends and leaves me feeling guilty and worse off than I was before I did whatever it was that I thought would make me feel better at the time. Its never predictable. Sometimes its sex, other times its pills and alcohol. Nothing ever done in excess enough to need any kind of rehab. I never fiend for anything, I just find myself needing something quickly to take my mind off of thoughts that I can't get out of my head.  
  
Fighting with my roommate is the hardest. She has been my bestfriend sense the age of 11 and is really my only kind of support system. Its hard to hear her tell me that I really do need to get a grip on my emotions and stop looking for other people to make me happy. Its hard because I know that I really am an emotional wreck and have this incredibly terrible fear of being alone. I feel absolutely mentally broken at times.  
  
Any romantic relationship I've ever tried to have has been disastrous. Knowing that I should spend more time on my own to make myself into a person that I actually like doesn't stop me from looking for someone to date. Its like an addiction that makes me feel absolutely disgusting because I know how other people see it.  
  
I don't feel like I'm succeeding at whatever lesson I was meant to be working on in this lifetime and after all my failed attempts at dating lately, I think I'm going to be forced to spend time on my own until I can get myself on the right track.  
  
But I'm really lonely. I don't have many friends and the close friends that I have managed to keep are starting their own families and getting married and having children and its heartbreaking to watch. The doctors tell me that I am running out of time for a chance to be able to have children myself because of a condition I have and I'm only 24. I'm afraid that maybe I'm not meant to have a family and I don't know if I'm strong enough to handle that.  
  
I feel that maybe I chose a lesson for this life cycle that a little more tough than I am ready for and I don't know a way out of. I'm spiritual but I'm not religious and I don't know how to ask for help other than the few ways that I've tried. Nothing is working right and I don't know what path I'm even supposed to be on. I know I need help but I'm not sure where to find it. I've been in an inpatient hospital twice in the past six months and am unwilling to go back. I see a therapist once a month but she can really only do so much for me in an hour.  
  
Its tough to see where I should be going from here 




 If you are still doing the free readings,  
My question is:  
What direction should I take in regards to romantic relationships?  
   
I asked this question during a meditation session and I think I got a sort of sign but it was confusing, so I thought I'd ask someone to do a reading for clarification. 




 I haven't tried it before so thanks for the suggestion, I'll give it a try. Anything new helps 




 I'm going to give that a try, Thank you 




 Yes, thats more it than anything 




 I just rather not have anything that's going to redden and dry my skin out even more. My skin seems to be hyper sensitive to everything. Like with shaving, I have to be super careful and I usually always get red patches anyway. 




 I've tried hydrocortisone, which seems to increase the redness. Aloe also increases the redness. Vasoline was suggested but it seems to just cause my pores to clog up and feels gross and seems to cause the area to break out some.  
  
Right now the thing that seems to help the most is olay night cream but I think that might be just because its keeping the area moisturized. It helps reduce the size of the scabs but not the redness.  
   
I wanted to look into some more natural options than the olay cream that I keep slathered on at all times during the day.

 Haha, poor pugger doesn't look terribly happy 




 [Picture of Tea Bag](http://imgur.com/7vFtuTC)

I drink at least 5 mugs of this "Cain's Orange Pekoe and Pekoe Cut Black Tea" every day.  
  
Its all that they stock at my office and I wanted to try some other flavors or types of teas that are also likely to keep me awake throughout the day.  
  
Looking for some suggestions on good or fair quality loose leaf teas.  
  
I'm completely new to all of the tea verbiage and am not sure where to start sampling. I'm reading through the FAQ's of this page now so hopefully I'll have a better idea soon but I would very much appreciate your suggestions as well! 




 Oh that is adorable!!  ^^  my pugger also sinks while flailing around all crazy 




 Woops. I edited the link to include an imgur image instead 




 [My Chart](http://imgur.com/SSAWTAb)  
  
I have been wanting to find the best area to focus on in my life but feel like I'm almost fumbling around blindly right now. I can't decide what I feel that I would best at or what would make me the happiest. I tend to overanalyze and then overwhelm myself.  
  
When I was younger I thought I would want to write, but I never seem to have the motivation to actually sit down and get everything typed out. I always get distracted with doing lots of interesting research for my stories. I thought maybe instead that I should look into a career in one of the things that I liked to read about. Maybe archaeology I thought, but the schooling seems so daunting if that ended up not being what I actually wanted to do, I would be wasting time. There seems to be a lot of traveling in that field, which is both exciting and scary at the same time. I've always lived in this one place and had the same bestfriend for years. I don't know if I can imagine a life away from her and I'm afraid that is holding me back. I can't decide if its my fear of doing something new that makes me apprehensive or my subconscious telling me that there is something that I would be better at doing closer to home here.  
  
I've also wondered if I should focus on my spiritual studies as a choice of career because it is an area that does great interest me. 
  
I was wondering if someone could look at my chart and tell me things that it would seem like I would good with. I've been trying to read some articles on how to more effectively read this chart myself but I would really like some outside opinions as well 




 I don't feel like I'm winning very much right now. The upper right group is pretty spot on. The upper left group matches as well, I have been feeling constant dissapointment with the outcome of almost everything I've tried to do lately. On the lower left group, I'm not really showy at all. I'm fairly shy. I am however quite emotional, or at least I show it more than some others that I know. Kind of like I've been wearing my heart on my sleeve lately and I'm not sure if thats what it could mean. As for the be yourself part, I'm not sure what direction I want my life to go in right now, which direction is really right for me. I've been trying to find the right area to focus myself on so that I stop looking for a relationship with all the wrong people and try to just make myself happy instead. Its too bad that is the area that I"m having the most trouble with right now. I wish I felt more in control of things :p  
  
For some reason I thought I had actually responded to this already  .   




 I've  thought about going back to school but the thought of racking up thousands more in student loans is scary but I have been thinking about switching my major to something more along the lines of archaeology so I will definitely put more thought into it.  
  
As for the job, I'm at an entry level position now and don't have a very good job history. Hopefully if I can get some more schooling, that might be an option further down the line.  
  
It is a dilemma. I'm interested in tarpits lately so tomorrow I hope to be able to find one close by that me and my roommate could go see.
