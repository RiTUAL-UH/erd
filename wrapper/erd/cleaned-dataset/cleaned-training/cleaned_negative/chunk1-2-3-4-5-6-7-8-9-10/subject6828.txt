 So excited for that. My only concern is Nolan tends to overshadow his actors from time to time with spectacle. 




 He'll never have mine. A big part of my childhood is watching this movie over and over. This and Grease. I regret nothing! 




 "Hello, Stu. If you hang up, I will kill you."


"What my name's not Stu, I'm kevin."


"Oh um, oh ok I see there's Stu. Could you hang up and leave please?"


"Ok. ***hangs up*** [Sigh of relief]



 




 I'll give you my own. Not a movie but: Matthew McConaughey in true detective is such a departure from what he's been known for. 




 Gah! It moved! 




 Impressive. 




 Heigl. 




 If people could do that, I'd be terrified the first few times it happened. After that I'd do it to get out of doing stuff like Jury duty.

 In that specific scenario, I wouldn't have walked backwards. I might get goosebumps. I'd only go backwards if there was some creature's face right behind me(less than a foot). 




 Yes, though.

 This movie was most certainly horror, or at least gruesome. 




 The trailer explained it. Thank you michael Caine. 




 "Call it." He's why the movie is so good. 




 I said nothing! 




 Signs and No country for old men. 




 This is my favorite thread!  




 Good segment. 




 Zombieland should be on here.  




 Already purple for me. 




 I was hoping he'd make it but the nature of the title led me to expect exactly what happened. 




 GTA IV, getting special executions on Liberty City's worst. 




 Good morning! In less than an hour.... 




 Well, the original story is that they grew up in the same town. Lex is only slightly older than Clark. Batman Vs. Superman. 




 I was hoping for Jensen ackles. I'm fine with Chris Evans though. 




 This is just a list of actors who'd look funny in tightey whities, 




 Lex and Clark grew up together. This would only work in a time travel plot line. 




 You'll always have kickass 




 Norman bates wears what would be considered small town casual attire. However, in the climactic scene, it is revealed that he dresses as his mother. He NEEDS to feel her clothes on his skin to become her. In the final scenes the psychologist or detective(look it up) says that now Norma bates has completely taken over. We see him dressed as Norman but talking as his mother. He no longer needs to wear his mother's clothes to be her.


As for Marion, she basically wears the same clothes throughout the 30 minutes she's on film. Any suggestions I make would be far fetched. 




 Recently re watched No Country For Old Men. http://youtu.be/M4Wek1VIfjA


 




 So pissed and upset that we lost his talent.

 Oh no, what have I done? 




 Russians who live in america. In the movie, radios still work. There would be a period of mistrust but eventually everyone would know the truth. 




 Wow, look at all these dead american men, women and children being killed. I as a Russian approve and will go out to greet these machines.

 A reminder to medics: it's entirely up to you whether to pursue your ambushers. My priorities on rescues are the safety of the medic(s) and of the patient(s). While Going after ambushers can be fun, they usually have a tactical advantage over you. 



Take many precautions and be safe out there! 




 I consider it mediocre and hit-and-miss with their jokes.  




 More specifically his chemistry in a comedy group dynamic as the leader of a bunch of **** ups. If you haven't, watch a good old fashioned orgy. 




 Next bill Murray, called it! 




 I prefer to interpret this video as many people either trying to reach out to him to get him to stop fighting everyone or fighters sent by the government to knock him out to contain him. Either way, he kick/punches them all. 




 I think he meant one of the Reddit Rescue Force moderators(Teamspeak or Subreddit), due to the fact that you're setting it up as an "RRF" triage center. 




 Don't know how to vote on this one. 




 Stewart!!! 




 Signs. 

For those of you not aware, this movie is heavily criticized for it's lapses in logic and plot redundancies. Folks argue that suspension of disbelief is too difficult to maintain especially considering the "water" issue. However, I can easily look past those issues and simply enjoy, what is, in my opinion, one of Mel Gibson's best performances. His struggle post grieving/ now athiest on top of raising two children is only compounded by these strange lights and their farm's crop circles. You can see the emotion on his face as he is trying to be stable for his family and eventually admits that he doesn't know what to do. Such a strong performance as well as some genuine scares. 

"Move, children! Vamonos!" 




 *Double the action*

*Triple the excitement*

"GET DOWN!"

*More excitement*

"GET DOWN, AGAIN!!!" 




 Fell off a watchtower, broke my legs. Luckily, I didn't die. West side of airfield.

 A friend and I have been shot unconscious by lesser creatures. We are both by the western jail on the airfield. I'm normally too prideful to ask for help but sometimes the medics need medics. This is on regular on taking place in rescue room 1.  









 30+ HOURS IN GAME. looking to play with 1 or more people. the lone wolf thing is not for me all the time. Open to most play styles. The hero play style seems way too risky but it might be because I'm not too experienced. Comment or pm, if you're interested and what you're looking for.

 For example: I work Security and have a structured routine everyday. It gets boring, so I tend to set myself on auto-pilot and think of other things. Crazy part: Like any auto-pilot, there are errors. I got into an argument with him for all of his screw-ups. I know he's just in my head, but as security I get bored and find myself talking to myself. I like to think that in my head I look like Bradley Whitford and my auto-pilot looks like Richard Jenkins from Cabin in the woods.


TL,DR: I, very recently, got into an argument with myself.  

















































 Oh my gawd yes. "Hey, are you even listening to me?" **Sheeeing!!!** 




 Quentin Tarantino- A film without references. 




 This is the end. 




 Repo men 




 American Psycho....maybe ;) 




 I still listen/ watch double toasted and rageselect. We need to stick together. I miss spill. 




 The original star wars, it helps that it follows the hero's journey format.

Also, skyfall. When it came out I saw a post highlighting that the cinematography is mirrored within the movie.

 I can't call it for you, it wouldn't be fair. 




 I like it, it's not bad. 




 Texas chainsaw massacre created the slasher film as we now know it. 




 Yes, I think so. A performance is what ends up on screen, regardless of how it is reached. 




 It was in the original script. I think diamonds or jewelery. Tarantino decided not to use it since reservoir dogs already had a suitcase full of jewelery. 




 Law abiding citizen. 




 It is important as an actor to convey a real performance.


In this case the director took it upon himself to force a genuine performance out of his performers. A bad director would do this right off the bat without allowing the actors a few takes first but this is a proactive method in my opinion. It shouldn't go too far to the point of abuse, such as Hitchcock on the birds or Kubrick on the shining. 




 Yeah, I'm going to bring you something, alright. I decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't going have to come looking for me at all.

2) that rooftop was teeming with hostiles, she was probably finishing them off.


3)true lies, when (this woman) drops the Uzi and it kills all the terrorists. It's funny and I get the point but it still doesn't make sense.

 Most movies I never revisit. I might re watch a movie either because it's good (District 9) or to give it another shot at the behest of others (Napoleon Dynamite) or just old favorites (Jurassic Park). If I watch a film at the movies it's usually just the 1 time. 




 I would love this cast...if it were another film. Why have I never heard of this movie?! 




 Maybe I'm in the minority but subtle product placement is good IMO, it can help immerse the audience. I'm taken out of movies when two characters are talking and one stops to drink "soda pop". Just drink coke or Pepsi like a real person please. 




 Lol. 




 How does he look like W.W.? 




 Wow. I'm lost.  




 It could be that they had the boy, it could be fixed with a line of dialogue. That is, if they want to bring him back. 




 Azazel? 




 Jack as Joker. He brought the comical psychopath to life. 




 I would like a superhero movie about a new, original superhero. Or maybe just a sequel to chronicle. 




 Ha ha ha 




 Oldboy. 




 It's nearly a shot for shot remake. Personally, I prefer REC because since the lead is not recognizable it is much easier to be immersed. Also I'd highly recommend REC 2 for being a creative follow up film. Have not seen Quarantine 2. 




 Yup, When he came on screen I almost yelled out "Godzilla isn't a threat, I AM THE DANGER!" 




 Tom Cruise is a movie star. Other than in movies where his characters name is the title (Jerry McGuire, Jack Reacher) it can be very hard to name his roles. 


An actor is an artist who would prefer you know them by their roles. Kevin Spacey is one such artist. He IS Frank Underwood. Kevin Spacey has made it a habit to stay out of the spotlight in order to better blend into his characters from the audiences' perspective. 




 Well you're concerned with the "branding" of the channel to make it more popular. I'm asking why no new videos? There are 3 up at the moment and I'm curious as to why? 




 I think a "Jury of your peers" is an obsolete practice and there are so many ways to manipulate these individuals.  









 I'm subscribed to it and since I frequently use YouTube I see it in my subscriptions lists.  




 I believe we were promised 2 videos a week. What's the issue? Are folks not sending in their rescues? Is there no time to edit and reformat the videos? What's up guys? 




 Dunno about Casey but definitely Jessica. 




 The following (season) takes place between 1:00 PM and 1:01 PM.


Events occur in frozen time. 




 Like that futurama episode. 




 ...and there's the mental image. 




 The Butterfly Effect. Let's have our main character abort himself. 




 In Kill Bill Vol. 1, Beatrix is in the kitchen talking to Vivica fox's character about when she could call it square between them. Una Thurman actually makes a square shape in the air when she says this, my guess is its a call back to her pulp fiction Mia Wallace character. 




 It's an awkward season, especially knowing what was happening behind the scenes. It's difficult to find laughs in that season. Also season 5 was funny with Harmon back but was tough to watch at points with the departure of two cast members. 




 Nolan. 




 Ah, yes. You're right, I go back and forth so much it just sort of melds together. I'll be more wary next time. 




 The first Harry Potter or Lord of the rings(fellowship). 




 No there wasn't but the writers thought it would be a good idea to imply that Debra was in love with Dexter. Gross. 




 Dexter: incest. ;( 




 Not a difficult movie to follow. 




 Also the game won't be out for a while, a lot can change and be rendered and tweaked between now and release. 




 Long live the king in the north!  




 This sounds like information overload, so much to catch up on can be overwhelming and terrifying. 




 I would prefer a man-woman pairing with the man being jaded and cynical and the woman young and idealistic. An added bonus would be if he's a sexist but really good at his job, kinda like Dr. House. I am personally a bit tired of the rural setting so either a big city or a snowy locale. Both of these places can foster feelings of isolation. I think the villain should be an active serial killer who makes it a point to contact the police. Also, a twist would be nice but not that one of the detectives is the killer (lazy writing).

Edit: also we need more tracking shots.

The fountain is very good as well. 




 Danny and Sandy (Grease)


Joel and Clementine (ESotSM)



Also any teen movie, romance just isn't like that anymore.


On the plus side there's always the ones that probably do stay together.


David and Elise (The Adjustment Bureau)



Ron and Hermoine (Harry potter series)



 




 I won't go that far but for me about halfway through i found myself talking to the screen. 


"Um, Superman, you're killing an awful lot of folks. er, ok. Wait, what? why are you upset that you [Spoilers-](#s "killed General Zod, you killed like at least 2,000 people")." 




 but you can replicate parts again and again to make a new ship or fix the part that broke. 




 well if it can replicate objects from the past, i could definitely see them fixing the ship...you know if they stop being girls about it. 




 But if the key is outside, it shouldn't be recreated. 




 Can't get much more elaborate than primer. 




 Was he peeing on the sandwich? or does he...pee sandwiches? 




 The ending was "underwhelmingly optimistic." That's how I'd describe it.

 I don't see how there can be good faith if Ubisoft is willing to lie about a game's visuals in order to build up hype. 

I understand they are trying to garner good faith by doing this but it isn't enough of a gesture, they're just admitting to a lie rather than doing something to satiate the customers. 

   How it come off, to me, is Ubisoft saying "look we're going to give you a product that is of lesser quality than what we promised but because we admitted it you guys shouldn't bitch about it." 




 You see, the problem isn't so much the game itself, it's the marketing. Ubisoft has a fantastic marketing department that knows how to sell a game and make you believe you are buying more than what you really are but without lying about it. This can potentially become the industry standard if the consumers go out and support Ubisoft. 




 There's also the opposite end of that coin, the author of fight club thought the movie was better.

 Cabin in the woods. MGM made this movie when they were in hot financial water, so they sold it to Lionsgate several years later. Lionsgate didn't market it well. This also happened to Red Dawn but that movie is forgettable. 




 Blue valentine, maybe. 




 Darth Vader's house. See what I did there? 




 The V/H/S films are decent, helps narrow down what kind of horror you like. 




 what they showed, i get where you're coming from but all that remained static was tom cruise and the omega. they never implied other universes. 




 They never implied that. 




 just a gritty crime movie like that, character focused. 




 Alice in Wonderland!!! 




 Yes. 




 Haywire. 




 It is, but it's going to lose so much money in the long run. It's a 180 million dollars budget and it only made 29 million on opening weekend domestically. It'll make it's money back overseas but Tom Cruise is not doing well in America if you consider Oblivion.  




 Since Edge of Tomorrow isn't working like they wanted it to. I would love to see Tom cruise in an independent film like Killer Joe. 




 That...would be funny. I woulda laughed my ass off. Time is frozen in a continuous loop until he gets a blood transfusion. 




 Why do you exist?!? 




 Watch it. Very fun action movie. Great movie if you love Tom cruise. Great movie if you hate Tom cruise cause you watch him die again and again.

 I understand, good question. The movie doesn't answer this, it's up to you to assume. Maybe Cage slept with the wrong General's daughter. 




 Usual Suspects, the negotiator, Watchmen. 




 Initially, he was sent to London to address any media concerns with regards to the impending invasion, presumably. Is this what you meant?

 I've heard that rather than focusing on Bilbos story, Peter Jackson has convoluted the plot by adding major aspects of The Silmarillion. I have yet to see the movies though.

 I like the trailers and thoroughly enjoyed the first. 




 No country for old men, the movie is very visual and already doesn't have a soundtrack. It's your typical black hat versus white hat versus josh brolin. 




 Both very good films IMHO. 


Both loosely deal with trying to fix the past.



Edge of tomorrow is a one-off movie, you go watch it and enjoy it. Take someone with you to talk to about it(not during). It's a bit smarter than a popcorn film. Good performances all throughout.



X-Men DOFP is also a very good movie, but something to take into account is how dense the movie is. This movie doesn't pick up right off of X-3, this is 10-20 years in the future and introduces the sentinel program. If you are ok with turning your brain on and have seen at least 2 X-Men movies then this is a good flick to watch.  




 Blue Valentine.

 The Tesla machine that Angier uses for his ultimate trick creates a duplicate of Angier. One remains in place at the machine and another several feet away. My question is if the "real" Angier is at the base of the machine isn't that certain death in regards to the glass tank beneath him? This is assuming that the original Angier is at the base of the machine. If it isn't then the original Angier dies during the first usr of the machine back in Tesla's house. So what was it?  


=calibrating the machine to Copy Angier the base of the machine and teleport the real Angier to a different spot.

=or Angier is fine with dying over and over to best borden


=Or maybe another possibility I haven't thought of.

 I have watched it again. I find that watching movies with a twist have tend to be enjoyable as you see how it builds up the twist. That is, if it's well done. Also it's fun to show someone a movie with a twist and see their reaction, but that's just me. 




 Operation Paperclip 




 I'm sorry, Mr. Williams. You've created countless smiles and that's just on my face. 









 Well, technically Mr. Universe was a better pilot than Wash only because he hacked his grades. So the Alliance would prefer to clone him. 




 It is but I like his style. 




 I like preparedness, you sir are a survivor.  




 For science... 




 Get off your ass and follow your dreams. 




 I think cloning a new wash would be more expensive than looking for a new pilot. Besides if they could they would've already done it in the comics. That being said it would be a neat concept to have clone wash have an existential crisis about being a clone. 




 Yeah, it's been accepted that Wash's death is the most brutal and emotional in the Whedonverse. It really hurt and was done ultimately because Serenity was a last hurrah for Firefly(as was River's rushed character development). However, if we were to get Firefly back, we would want Book and Wash back, even if it meant in a parallel universe. 




 Mal lived...do you mean Wash? Look I used the show, movie and comics to create season two. In the end I sent them to an alternate universe where everyone could come back.  




 I expected this insight, I know it's kind of a cheat but Firefly itself was cheated and fans would look over this if it meant Wash and Book could come back. It's the writing equivalent of saying,'we're starting over because we didn't get a fair shot the first time.' And quite frankly it seems less sci-fi that we Unkill wash than Firefly coming back (please Netflix).

Joss has said that when he is done with Marvel and Nathan is done with Castle he might revisit the 'verse.


I don't think it's so outlandish to accept a universe tear, even in today's world we are experimenting with particles that could erase everything. I will concede that it's a bit of a coincidence that wash be near the crash site.  




 *blows air, spitting* 




 I tried to do this myself and failed. 




 Also I used current canon planets.   




 At the beginning Shepherd book and Wash are still dead but I created a rift in the universe with the cosmic cloud (think fantastic 4) that threw them into an adjacent universe.  




 I tried to make some characters from season 1 come back (Jubal and Bager) but not so much to stretch them thin. 




 Great ok, here we go.

There's obviously alot I'm leaving out, the plot summaries are basically what you would read off of imdb when clicking on the episode. The ending are the end scene/s. 




 I spent the better part of this afternoon creating plot summaries for 14 episodes of Firefly for a second season. 

I read an Adam Baldwin interview where he said he'd love to return to Firefly but he would want Wash to be unkilled....so I tried to achieve that.

Interested?

 Batman's footage is very interesting. He leaps from rooftop to rooftop, when decending upon the criminals of Gotham you can see him systematically pick them off and beat them to a pulp.


However, Tony Starks footage is just more fun to watch, he zooms through the battles and shoots at folks while cracking smart ass comments.


In this respect, the thing to remember is that Batman probably suffers from a mental disorder since he habitually goes out to fight crime and takes no pleasure in doing it. Tony Stark can notice the danger in what he does but will make it fun to watch all the same.

 I thought it explained itself one too many times but it didn't seem complicated to me. I was just like, "yeah, I get it." 




 It'd have to be a new character just as he is being trained, similar to the first game. He assassinates two targets in an attempt to discover where the templars have hidden the holy grail. After the second, the assassins reveal to the main character that they'd been grooming him to become the best assassin, in order to kill the pope (Assassin's creed II), just after killing the pope, the papal vault opens up as it does in the game and we see the precursors appear and when they are about to reveal the location of the holy grail the dna stream desyncronises and desmond wakes up in abstergo to an explosion in the lobby. Security rushes him to the holding cells when they are killed by a female assassin. She shoots out a window, looks out into the street below then at desmond. She says, " I knew your father, I can get you out of here. I need you to trust me." 

"Ok."

 A home video of everyone you've ever loved. You would go from immense sadness to depression to mourning, rage followed by acceptance. Then you'd begin to wonder how their lives continued after you were gone. You'd create intricate backstories of arguments and vacations, imagine them to the smallest details. Madness consumes you, you are angry but don't understand why, sad but don't understand why. You stare at the faces of strangers,numb, for an eternity. Centuries pass and you cannot quite recognize these people. Then you create a new story with them and how they were once people you loved...

 Four years ago, I was stationed 550 miles SE of Bagram Air Base. We'd been doing consistent daytime flyovers of the tribal regions to the east, getting intel back to logistics. 


One day me and crew were flying the C130 on a recon and everything is peachy till we get about half way through return from the AO and we start getting peppered with small arms fire which is strange considering how high up we were. Turns out logistics screwed up and sent us over heavily populated Al Qaeda mountains. So there I am manning my console, trying to do my job and not get shot. RPGs are missing the plane by just a few feet. 



After about five minutes, we make it clear of the enemy fire and I'm able to take a breath. I look at my console and it has a 7.62 right through the middle of it. It's broken. I cal my CO over to take a look at it and he tells me that 7.62 rounds can make 30k feet. No, he said. That there is tree fiddy rounds. And I said tree fiddy? We ain't got no Loch Ness monster in al Qaeda firing no tree fiddy rounds.

 It's very easy to point to a recent movie trailer and say it's one of the greatest of all times. Case in point, The Wolf of Wall Street. I'm asking if you can recall a movie trailer preceeding 2010 that is truly great to look at and garners excitement for that movie.

 Chief of staff,Jack Klein rushed into the Oval office. President Warner sat at his desk reading over  the parks appropriations act that had been passed by the house. Jack stood before the President. 
"Jack have you gone over this?"
"Of course, Mr. President."
"What did you think of the Yellowstone oversight comittee."
"Mr. President, I just had aides look over the 600 page bill last night, not a one think you should pass it." 
"And why is that?" 
"It's socialist to begin with, the democratic leadership made it marginally socialist to win political capital come the midterms. They expect you to veto." 
"Which I will?"
"It's either that or the republicans will shun you come 2020, they'll call you the second coming of Vlad Lenin."
"Right, was there something you wanted to talk about?"
"Yes, Mr. President. There's an unidentified flying object sighted just northwest of Oregon by an F-22 raptor part of the 142nd fighter squad out of Portland. I have General Braddock briefing David as we speak."
"What do we think it is?"
"The pilot is still pursuing the object but cannot establish visual contact. Our intelligence notice a spike in Russian activity, so the general consensus is that it's a Russian bomber defecting." 
"Alright, let's go."



The President enters the situation room, it is filled wall to wall with men and women wearing stars and stripes. They stand before him. 

"Have a seat, let's do this."

The Generals sit. Jack sits to the left of the President. 

"Alright, I want to know what you know."

The room is silent. 

"I meant you, General Reynolds."
The general looks at the President, clears his throat.
"Mr. President, two hours ago our pilot spotted an airborne object over Canadian soil, now after interfacing with NORAD we've confirmed that it's not ours."

"And we believe it's Russian?"

"Well considering the size, yes."

"Do we know what kind of plane it is?" 

"Well, we think it's a long range bomber."

President Warner turns to Jack. "Why do they keep saying think and guess?"

"Mr. President we've only detected the object through radar. There's a snowstorm in the area and the pilot of the F-22 has had to keep altitude well above it."

General Reynolds interjects, "Mr. President the pilot says the object is clearing the edge of the storm. I'm putting him on speaker. He's on."

The President looks at the radar on the t.v. across the room, a big blip is steadily in front of the smaller blip in the center. General Reynolds says,"Son you're on in the situation room with the President of the United States."

President Warner leans forward slightly,"Good afternoon son, can you tell me your name?"

"My name is Captain James Bradley. Mr. President it's an honor."

"Captain, what can you tell me about this flying object?" 

"I'm afraid not much, I only picked it up as it was going into the storm a while ago and it's been in there pulling serpentine maneuvers. It seems to be heading towards the edge of the storm now. General Reynolds has advised me to approach at an intercept vector from it's right flank to confirm visibility."

The President nods at General Reynolds. The General says to Captain Bradley," Maintain open radio Captain we're keeping you on. " The General presses the mute button."Thirty seconds until we achieve visibility."

The President looks at the General, "No radio response, yet?"

"None, it could be interference from within the storm."

President Warner turns to Jack Klein and whispers, "Jack."

"Yes, Mr. President? "

"If this goes poorly take us to DEFCON 3."

"Yes, Mr. President."

The General looks at the radar screen. The big blip is now to the top left of the small blip and closing. "FIVE seconds, Mr. President."

"Three."

"One."

The General unmutes the pilot. "Captain Bradley what can you see?"

"ERm, not anything right now. Wait. I see something. It's one fire. Wait I'm picking up a signal. It's NORAD."

An aid hands General Reynolds a phone. The General says," Patch it through." 


"Mayday, mayday. our engine is on fire this is flight 7---"

Captain Bradley comes back on the speaker, "General, can you hear me?"

"I'm here, Captain. Can you tell us what's going on?" 


"It, uh,appears sir to be a single engine Cessna got lost in the storm. Pulling back around to get a better look. I think on ground personnel should get ready for this."

Jack turns to the President. He looks intently at the radar screen. The big blip remains only it's now behind the pilot. The President stands. "Call him out of there."

The pilot on the intercom says,"Sorry, what was that." The line turns to static.

"Get out of there Captain!" 

The radar goes to black. The President bellows, "What the hell happened?"

General Reynolds now wears a bead of sweat, "we lost connection."

"Well get it back, get me something I can look at!" 

A General from the edge of the table swipes at his tablet. "Getting you satellite now, Mr. President." 

The President squints at the end of the table, "Who's that Tambley?"

"Yes, Mr. President." 

"Now then, General Tambley."

A top down satellite image appears on the screen. A massive snow storm frames the left side. In the center are two pillars of black smoke. The image switches to infrared, only two sources of heat, both of them are downed aircraft. From the corner of the screen appears a great, big blue bird, draped in thorns, it flies over the smoke and into the storm.



The room is silent. Every mouth agape. Jack turns to the President. "Mr. President?"

"Do it, Jack. God Help us. Do it."

 Yes, I've played this mission and I understand the cross-reference with the elder scrolls. It's just my opinion that given the content of the mission strikes a negative chord with me given the recent events. 


The mission tasks you with killing or at least participating in the mass murder of innocent civilians at an airport terminal. People are dead today because of a similar heinous act and this picture seems in poor taste.

 This is just the very final song and has an emotional moment tied to it. Sons of Anarchy is a gangland type show with a Shakespearean tragedy as it's core structure, if that interests you then by all means.  




 The movie has silly moments but down in the basement I was left as breathless as Morgan. The entirety of the film is a portrayal of how a man who loses his faith approaches an impossible situation. I well up every time I watch the movie at several scenes.The last supper when his kids finally see how terrified Graham is and they embrace him.

 He has the keys to your house. Is that someone you want to treat poorly? Also, offer him something to drink and eat. If he is working in a hot area, point a fan in oscillating setting.

When he takes a dump in your toilet, offer him the finest toilet paper, none of that single-ply second world bullshit. As a matter of fact, just let him wipe with any cotton comforter you have.

 It always comes back to him? 




 (Just my opinion.)


I like the idea. The execution faltered a bit. If you wanna take comedy serious, from what I can tell, you have to be consistent. Always be funny and everyone treats the situation seriously. The main character did well to keep a straight face but the secondary didn't. (Just my opinion.)


I wasn't laughing. The whole time I was waiting for the other shoe to drop but it never did. By the end I was like, oh he's just a dick. That's the joke? (Just my opinion.)

I would've had some comic relief to bring balance to his brashness. Like a fat mentor who can't keep up with perps and tells the intern not to run faster. (Just my opinion.)



I'm not trying to discourage you at all. I would never do that. You frame your shots well and you clearly have a drive to entertain and that's wonderful. Also keep in mind that comedy is the hardest challenge to tackle because it's so subjective. 




 Hey, Miami!....oh, right. :(

 There's a shot of the sniper character, in the background a person walks from left to right, that was accidental, no? 




 From what I've gathered in this sub so far, the general consensus to beginners is: find a camera and start filming. 




 What you could do is engineer a memory for yourself. Take a very slow walk around your block, don't create any distractions for yourself and absorb as much as possible. Go back home and write down what you remember, focus on what stuck out to you and ask yourself why that specifically. 

Now remember, films only access sight and sound. It is up to you as a filmmaker to recreate the emotions of memories using only those two senses. Be creative, I challenge you to experiment and come up with something no one else has. 

P.S. don't try to crowbar in other senses with dialogue such as "oh this is delicious" or "it smells wonderful in this park."

P.P.S. Smell-o-vision was a thing, did not catch on. 




 In the behind the scenes footage the crew explain that this trap is very simple to get out of by pushing up the "cuff" of the trap hand, but when both hands are in you need to wait for someone to do it for you or you're fucked.

 Do you have other films? 




 Writing question: For shorts 1-5 minutes in length do you guys tend to make scripts for it? I was wondering how much pre-production goes into these. 


Also, is there a recommended time for writing? 

For example: 1st draft (1-4 months) 




 That was nice, I bet it would've looked funny to the neighborhood when you were filming.

 Where's the trailer? 




 Just saw it. The plot could have been a little tighter, the "dad" person James would go into didn't lead anywhere, whereas the "homeless" and "business" persons were not only congruent but also simultaneous. That and the punching sound effect at the beginning.was a bit jarring and took me out for a second. 


Aside from that I was entertained throughout, and I was eager to see how it would end. Fortunately, you guys didn't make the common mistake other filmmakers make where the concept is drawn out and makes you lose interest. In this case, you took a good amount of time to set up your characters and tell your story. Kudos. 




 do you remember a particular moment or you just eased into what you're doing now? was it what you wanted to do before?

 Thank you, I really didn't know. Have an upvote. 




 1) All I ever read about are festivals, where can I look up markets in my area? Which of the two are better for networking?


2) I've never made a film before, how should I go about funding my first flick?


3) What's a one sheet?


4) For each level of funding, what type of film qualifies? For example, a tiny 20 minute film about jogging. Would that qualify for pre sales?

5) I know I'll sound like a 1800's era gentleman but on the funding side, who do I see about these things?


 




 What's this meme? 




 I'm trying to pool together the cash, was looking for a workable timeframe. Thanks, I hope I beat the clock. 




 Could you be a bit specific about funding? Then a general overview of marketing? Also don't know the difference between festivals and markets.

 I understand your point, I've been there but that is definitely plan B. I've gone over it in my head and decided that I will die happy if I can make a steady living doing SOMETHING in film. Even if I were an extra, the fact that I'd be contributing to what, to me, is a sacred form of storytelling would be enough to keep me happy. 


But I want to tell stories and help others tell theirs, I want to do for others what great directors do to me. Grab an audience out of their chairs and make them terrified of going to the beach, or believe in true love or time travel. If I could do that Once, I have achieved my dream.

So? are you an idea person or are you a support? Someone who creates an idea in their head or someone who helps realise it in front of a camera? 

You know you love movies, that is 90% of the work done. You never have to work a job you hate because you're unsure of your passion. 


What are you good at that you want to do alot of professionally and how can that be involved in filmmaking? 




 Check this trailer out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hYlB38asDY




Note the music and the cuts. Then note the changes in musical tone, the music ends when the action/trauma begins then once that's over the score swells up around 0m50s. Study this trailer for a bit. Notice how the volume changes and you can hear the actor, oftentimes the music remains but very much in the background.

 GTA V-First person mode. 




 This shot has many cuts, sped up action, blurs are added to create a sense of super speed, the main character is kept in the center of the shot most of the time. And lots of choreography BUT with this many cuts this fight probably took more than a day to shoot. 




 You should sit yourself down and think for a hard long while.



This is the only life you're gonna get. No retries, no do overs. What do you want to dive into and commit to for the rest of your life. When you're older and no longer able to work because senility is creeping in you're going to need to KNOW you didn't waste your shot. Don't expect someone to suggest something and you do it because it sounds like fun. It needs to burn inside your chest, fill you with exhilaration just the thought of heading towards that goal. Passion is painful, but it's such a beautiful pain because you know it's what you were meant to do. Why you are here.

 Just found this subreddit and since the last post was more than a week ago I was wondering what projects you guys are working on. 




 FIRE! 




 Something that MADE me lose faith in humanity is the mainstream media. Every story has to do with some massacre or execution. If it's not then it's a critique of how the world is dealing with it. And oh my god, shut the fuck up about the planes. 


After too much, I had to just turn it off and go outside.  It's a beautiful day.  




 Not a Hitler. 




 Do you set the toilet paper towards you or away? 




 A moment of clarity.


No one should go through life doing what they don't want to do, you should sit down with a clear mind and allow yourself to fantasize how your life could be better, then go out and work to achieve that.


Note: This does not apply to any Hitlers reading this. 




 This is a stupid question. 
























 Have you seen Bloodline? That first season is 13 episodes...about 10 of those is just padding. 




 Actually, he's just been standing outside of Emma Stone's apartment since the Dumb and Dumber To premiere. 




 Which unequivocably  means working  under Friedberg and Seltzer. 




 Add onto that overprivileged selfish white guys who wanna get out of the projects...oh wait they're not in the projects WTF. 




But seriously, the only way I'd see this movie is if it turns out to be a straight-faced parody of itself.   




 I came here to say this. I would love for there to be a scene where he grabs himself and is shouting for his old face to be returned to him. "Give ^it ^^back!" 




 What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this thread is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.  




 Don't let facts hide the truth. 




 Whoa, hey now...It's definitely a different take and I can respect any actor willing to take on a role that would undoubtedly be compared to such a memerable character...That being said, the Mads Mikkelsen lends a more reserved take on the character, which has paid off so far and is a service to the character. Whether the writing holds up in the future, one can only hope.

 THE STAR WARS TEASER BEFORE THE AVENGERS LOOKED BEAUTIFUL!!! 




 Watching Dear Zachary would be worth it to watch again by way of introducing someone new to the movie just to savor the moment of devastation on that persons' face...were it not for the fact that my soul disintegrates after every viewing. 




 Mine are as follows:

1) Sofia Coppola-Lost in Translation


2) Kathryn Bigelow-The Hurt Locker


3) Mary Harron-American Psycho 




 THEY COMFORT HIM! 




 What version of '50 shades of Gray' did you watch?

 I like Pizza Hut...when the food was already ordered and my window to object has passed. Dibs on the breadsticks. 




 What has become of the world when the sharing of knowledge is considered a topic of high praise. 




 Every account on reddit is a bot except you. 




 It's a decent show with a higher production value and attention to detail than most. I've only missed the final season, which I've heard mixed things about.  




 He shows up in 3-4th seasons as a mid level gangster allied to Nucky. He has a fairly interesting arc if you pay attention. 









 It's a miracle! 




 Tell her to stop, she's been making my bus ride unpleasant. Seriously though, that's awesome. I hope my mom makes it that long. 









 I heard the ending notes of the star spangled banner as I read that.  




 This show could've been better with different actors and stories every season. 




 That's Catholic School for ya.

 I read this like Eddie from grounded for life. 




 Wow, this prank got me. I was fooled. It was a victimless joke and both videos were funny with and without the context. That's how you write a joke. Can't wait until Denis does the late show rounds and talks about this and other ACTUAL nightmare shoots.

 I miss ACOCO. "LIVE from the Spill studios located behind the liquor store off the I-35 Interchange, it's time once again for a couple of cold ones with Korey and Carlyle." *sigh* 




 Yes. 




 I agree but that series got overdone and whenever they would introduce a new element it wouldn't work.  




 That's not an actor though.  




 Still I would like to see him pass the bond buck. 




 Mel Gibson. I know people hate him for he prejudiced remarks but the dude can act...even if he is aging rapidly, What's up with that.  




 Awesome,  I had planned to watch this yesterday but couldn't find it. 




 Are there any talented actors that have stagnated or disappeared that deserve a comeback?  




 The babadook? To US Netflix?  




 Saw this last night. I loved how the entity in the house opened the door behind her slowly. Instead of freaking out she unscrews the door. 




 The Shawshank Redemption. 




 Yep, although parts feel a bit exploitative. 




 Put the bunny...back in the box. 




 Also, why? 




 Look, the whole "pay to win" system is in place to target either casual players or gamers who simply don't have the time to play as much because they're working or they're parents. You can stand on the shore shaking your fist at the ocean all you want but that tide's coming in. I agree that some games are really bad with this method but eventually the market will decide. I personally don't play these games but I don't fault those who do. spend your money how you like.

 "The gang gets reviewed." 




 My lens. The one pictured above, is it me or the lens?


I can only get things into focus if they are extremely close, is it my fault? 




 So is my lens not for what  I'm looking for? 




 Why do I keep screwing up? 

1st- the camera I order is all Japanese. 
2nd-the lens I get is 4/3 not "micro" 4/3
3rd- the sd card I get isn't formatted for video recording.
4th- i don't understand how to use the lens.

 I have a 35mm f1.6 and a 14-45mm f3.5-5.6. I'm having trouble getting alot in focus with the latter it's usually only really close things like my guinea pig.  try to keep in mind that I'm just starting out so its most likely my fault that I'm doing something wrong. My preference would be to shoot in wide angles with a "deep depth if field." 




 That movie wasn't quite my tempo. 




 He might fit in his vision if they shot with a wide enough lens. 




 If it's a dream why does it ask beforehand if you wanna wake up?  




 Each of his videos is worth watching. 




 How do you make a miniature city? 




 This picture drew up some controversy when it was released. 




 He has a "Dreams Shattered" look when Abed clarifies that. 




 in my opinion you should record all of the auditions and have the actresses act out the crucial point in the movie and then pick up scene and have them improv that part but don't let them come in with something that they could have had prepared beforehand. 




 Looking for films that accurately depict how a person would rationalise and commit a murder in real life. 




 Gotta add meatballs and some sort of multivitamin and I'm good. 




 I watched this before eating today. Even with the bathroom scene as contrast, spaghetti has never looked sexier. 




 I've seen examples of shots taken using a particular lens and the image bends or blurs near the edges. 


Also how can you tell if a lens has a short/long throw? 




 Each of his videos are worth watching. 




 I don't know. When buying lenses online I wouldn't be able to distinguish good lenses from bad ones. I don't know what to look for.


Also are there any lenses that are good in action shots but bad in still shots or vise versa?



What is a short throw(as opposed to?)? 




 Be creative with what you have, make the shots narrower and you can redress and reuse extras.

Film riot had a thing about this. 




 How do you know if a lens is bad for filmmaking? 




 Each of his videos are worth watching.  
























 Going after a [Best Picture, huh](http://i.imgur.com/kiru8Fa.jpg)? 




 I gotta go rewatch this. Saw it in theaters but I like me my subtitles. 




 For me it's The Dark Knight rises- Christopher Nolan. (Still better than Man of Steel) 









 Plus, you could use this to have them accidentally attack a family member. 




 3) "Lieutenant Dan, ice cream. Lieutenant Dan?"

2) " I'm pretty tired...I think I'll go home now."

"Yes...I know that."



Forgive the mistakes this is from memory and I seem to have misplaced my internet. 




 It was a fun movie with a fresh concept and art house direction. 




 My favorite Brian Brushwood video: [Mexican Race War](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1iSiTMjQmM t=7m10s). 




 Have not seen Brazil. Have heard the ending in this subreddit 2+ times this week. 




 I agree, I also like all the scenes that precede this scene. 




 I didn't realise I was getting downvoted. Noted. 




 Gone Girl. 


I haven't read the book. I'm just fascinated when [a ](#s "character intricately weaves together a diabolical plan that satisfied her need for revenge and gave her a happy ending") 




 Good choice.  









 Hoping for that 4-hour Joss Whedon cut.


Still haven't see the movie. 




 Moon and Hangover. 


I had the pleasure to work in the theater during their run. Also The Hurt Locker. 




 Sometimes when I'm watching a movie, if it's really good I don't want it to end. 




 Firefly 




 So how's your sex life? 




 The second viewing caught me off guard. I would laugh at stuff I didn't laugh at before. 




 Kidnapped(Sequestrados). It's on US netflix. It was mentioned a few days back in a list but no one had seen it. The movie is tense and consists wholly of a few (6) tracking shots during it's entirety. 




 Go on... 




 Especially with nobody at the wheel. 




 I don't know what to believe anymore. 




 What about leaving change in a tip jar? 




 Been there. Just praying for each following block. 









 I would see the trailer for it. 




 How could I "DIY" this? 




 Sorry, mobile. 




 Elon Musk and Steven Spielberg were looking to get their hands on the game. 




  I joined just before this E3 to see if there'd be a release date. Stayed since you guys are mostly alright.

 Cool. Coolcoolcool. 




 Your references are outta control. 




 Bet on black. 




 Inspiration hits me at any time and it can be tempting to follow it. However that could be a subconscious attempt to have you quit on a current project. I just write down what hits me and put it away to get back to later. This helps create perespective. it might be a great idea but you might have learned something about yourself or the idea that forces you to consider whether to venture writing it. For example, last night I was watching an alien b-movie and I thought " I could do this better. This movie is sending a message about the war in the middle east but the dialogue is atrocious. If I were to do this...". So after fleshing out an idea, I put it away because pursuing it would take away my concentration from the first project.

  Firefly

FTFY: Serenity 




 I'd like to read it...maybe. 









 This series should end with Tudyk and Fillion laying by the poolside and have an exchange like this: 

T: So, I hear Spectrum might come back soon.

N: Really? 

T: No, not really. That would be like Firefly coming back. 




 He was also in the rules of attraction as Patrick Bateman. 




 How could I fix the first issue? I'm on Celtx.


The judge was addressing someone offscreen. I was implying a society of rapid fire type trials.

 I disagree.  18 "quintillion" planet seems to be a one galaxy figure. If I were to decipher,  I'd guess you get launched back to the edge of the galaxy but an area opposite of your starting point.

 He looks like the game developer from the penultimate season of Dexter.  




 But will we see him pee? 




 In the GI cover of NMS they said you could see a ship fly by and that might be an npc or a player. He went on to make the point that that's how you see what your avatar looks like.  When did this change?

 I just saw it, this movie was pleasantly surprising. I give it props for the realistic deaths which added to the tension. I also liked not knowing wtf was to happen next. 




 For example: The Matrix films are live action but the Animatrix is animated.
