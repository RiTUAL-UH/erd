 The Praxis of My Method, underscored by all necessary humilities and good graces.

Let's jump right into it and grab as many electron rings as we slide down the pipeline of letters, doers, willers, thinkers, feelers, wishers, commanders and demanders...

The state of mastership is to be at all times consciously and positively in receptive and gracious attitude. Open to all good and positive powers to flow through you is a paramount condition, and to direct them in the proper channles of good thoughts, words and deeds the further fruitage of the tree of eternity (the fully restored cosmic ego).

All around us, at all times, are the titanic forces of the entire universe, unique in our present positions, which seek forever to enter into and transmute you and themselves according to laws which can be discovered and harnessed for the good purposes of uplifting the estate of life and sustaining the vitality of being. These transmissions from the infinity expanse of complex diverse forms and minds encounter no resistance when in proper channels from the Master/Mistress of their own Destiny. To find the hidden music of the moment is to establish the master rhythm with the body and from the body back to the world. It relinquishes the dependency on the fetal impressions of the mother and the world at time of conception, pregnancy and delivery (the first causes of all subsequent causal reactions and responses) as well as memory dependence on negative and adverse surroundings, coincidences and influences. This establishment of the master rhythm was accomplished in a variety of elementary procedures in the ancient schools, be they Hebrew baptism, the Babylonian-Dravidian heat tests, the Egyptian endurance tests, or even the somewhat less known tradition of live burial for purposes of feeling the earth itself in full exposure to the earth itself, vaguely popular amongst certain lesser known mystery cults.

Only those who can read this and already understand the value of it without having to do it will be sufficiently advanced to proceed with deeper lessons. Atavistic remonstrance is worth it's weight in immediate experience. Don't re-invent the wheel itself.

In the Great Work of Mastery, the main and the only object is to attain communion with the harmonious creative power of the world and consciously joining the forces for solving the destinies of the Evolution towards Immortal Oneness.

The first steps along this infinite journey involve a mastery of thoughts and through the thoughts a mastering of the body; the dynamic so established releases hidden potentials through the energetic activation of previously energy-starved processes.

Many definitions of mastery exist: to overpower, to subdue, to rule, to possess dominion, superiority and victory of beings conscious of it.

Consider further that man is generally in a state of slavery of one sort or another. Everywhere you look you see people in one state of involuntary bondage after another, and all of them creating more chains to bind those who are not bound like themselves.

This slavery is produced by ignorance on any of the planes of manifestation (the short list being physical, emotional, intellectual and psychic) and any combination there of. Ignorance is imbalance at best, and many other horrible things at worst.

Competition amongst the slaves of the world for the supposed benefits of further bondage has resulted in an almost penal atmosphere, wherein every breath brings anxiety and fear, and thus agitates and depletes the reserves of energy for the body and the mind to function as a healthy union of the forces.

This condition, of pandemic psychosocial slavery is one that must be overpowered, must be subdued, has to have a ruling decision made over it, and be possessed by the dominion of a new system, superior and victorious for Man and the Forces alike, to bring about the revitalizing and vast expansion of expressions of each, to sustain the world and even turn deserts into paradise.

And towards a paradise on Earth one has lent the ears that heard that the words mystic, occult and magick get thrown around pretty commonly today, and so I wanted to recapitulate how I am wont to believe them to mean.

Mysticism is born from careful observation of impressions through supersensitive channels, both biological, psychological and technological. It can be a state of mind alone, but it is also the observation of that state of mind in the midst of being it.

Occultism thus becomes the correct interpretation of that which can't be seen at the same time what is seen is also interpreted as the effects, causes, or side-effects of the invisible properties and objects of the world. It is engaged through a soulful conscious discrimination between assembling data.

Magick must follow suite and make manifest the practical application of mysticism and occultism; the powers of creation, destruction and transmutation in action at the behest of a will possessed of self-solidarity and worldliness to make things happen or not happen according the truth the magician holds at heart.

Yes, so in measure the mother of invention herself embraces those moments when her offspring manifest the 3 overmentalities.
In a word or thrice spoken lesser worlds, finding no other solution to the problem of YOU, decided to feed yourself back to yourself and make you even more YOU, which solved two problems with one philosophy's stone. You couldn't escape yourself, and the world learned all about you while containing you completely in a binding of self-other-self-grammar.

The attempts of the limp world to contain you only fail because it is now seen as a foreign taste which now has to get you to like it too, and you only will if the world becomes you itself, which it will make small concessions too, and progressively, if conditions are correct your central sphere of influence will now have a probability-spreading shell of orbiting factors that serve you because they became you, and being you can't speak to you in anything other than your own voice, so they are themselves mute, and you face the second entrapment.

The breakdown of those orbiting elements in their exposure to an external world that is now less familiar with your ultimate self, is slowly becoming familiar with your extant orbiting self-satellites, and since the world still has to trap you and them it binds them in the same procedure it used to bind you in the beginning. Take heart, the world CANNOT learn, it can only grow and repeat.

Thus you reach the third extension, and the snapping of the leash, that of the world's reflexes becoming your own, and now you can interact with the world through decaying aspects of your own history and new aspects of your present and future, safely for the first time, because now the world can only see itself in you.

Fortunately you think now of an "orange" and the taste of it, and the funny architecture of it, and remember all the arrangements of situations that presented the orange to you, and foresee all the memories of the orange as it is. New tones enter your life and your satellites learn new forms of communication and the amount of acquired information about your universe expands exponentially, taking you to a new level, wherein you become self sustaining in a way that the world no longer can effect.

Thus you have attained a harmonized consciousness. Eternal satisfactions are not yet too far ahead.

 Does anyone know if this subreddit /r/f04cb41f154db2f05a4a is part of the A585 mystery or is it something else? 




















































































 This page named "page 14" seems like the start of a series, which has interesting content. It's a series, because if you click the **right arrow** at the top of the page, you will proceed to page 14a, page 14b, page 14c, and so on. The content actually seems to make some sense, and it's a lot of content.

http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/coloured%20site/first%20button/1.htm 




 Here is yet another spinning ying-yang found in the website. This one however, is very hidden. It is found by going to Index 5, then clicking on **The Act of Creation 2**, which leads you to the page below with the ying-yang.

http://973-eht-namuh-973.com/Magick/actofcreation2.htm

This ying-yang is bigger than the 1st one. However, the mystery is that it's purpose is unknown. When you click it, it just zooms in, disappears, then reappears again. This page in general is mysterious.... all there is is 3 objects, but it is unknown what is the purpose of this page. Any ideas as to what it's purpose may be? Feel free to share. 




 This page seems to be like some sort of main menu for the website. In the middle is also a glowing and spinning ying-yang; if you click it, it sometimes leads you to Index 5, and sometimes to the Advent Index.... why this happens? I'm not sure. Some links in the website just lead to two different places for some strange reason. You can check it out on the link below.

     I couldn't get to class on time because there was a **TRIANGLE** :'( 









 Yo, on friday I saw a man on the bus and he was dressed up as a woman!!! Why??? It's not right!! He was Indian, about 35-45 years old, wearing a long woman's jacket, skinny jeans, women's boots with high heels, he was holding a purse, sitting with his legs crossed like a woman, and he even had his hair in a little bun like many girls like to make their hair!! I promise i'm not lying, I really did see this unbelievable sight on the bus on friday february 13, 2015!!!!!  I was laughing my head off for the whole ride, and there were only about 5 other people on the bus, so I was the only one who noticed it since I was sitting at the back! Then the man-woman noticed I was laughing so it turned its head around, and smiled a dreamy smile!!! EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! {:'-D 




 Here is the grand gallery, which houses much of the artwork and pictures which can be found throughout the website. An easy discovery, yet cool artwork! Take a look at this rather amazing art by clicking on a number at the bottom of the page. Each number contains different art!

http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/gallery%20button/galleries/0.htm 




 This appears to be the main page of the website, and also the longest. What could The Evokation mean? What is this the purpose of this page? Share your ideas!

 This is one good-looking dude, don't you think? 




 Ok, so I was sitting outside, and all of the sudden a moth looking similar to a gypsy moth flew right towards my right forearm and embeded itself into my skin. It was just slightly painful, but the moth's soft texture could be felt when you ran your fingers over it. Why?? Oh why!!?? :D 
























 This brightened my day up... I hope it happens for real.

 He actually saved the whole world. Believe it or not, the fact that he was sent back in time changed history. Thanks to his time travel, Earth rotated 42 milliseconds faster on it's axis while he was here, thus preventing the tip of the solar emission from hitting Earth. According to calculations, had 20141220 not traveled back in time, Earth would not have rotated faster, and at the time of the solar storm, the tip would have hit Earth, taking all the lights out. Therefore, this was not all a lie. The truth is.... we have been saved. 












































 I'll be honest.... I kind of believed there was a possibility for the lights to go out, though I doubted it would be as severe as described. And yes, part of me wanted this big change. But oh well, there's both good and bad about the lights not going out.


Good: I won't have to suffer a slow and tortourous death

Bad: Life stays the same



Overall, I must say this was a good experience. It was very smartly played, as very few people can actually get me to fall for believing something like this. Consider this: I didn't even believe the world would end back in December 2012! Yet, part of me believed the lights would go out now in 2015.



Well, I guess things resume back to normal.... and I'll be able to create my **Space-Pizza Subreddit**! :)

**EDIT:** I'm currently about 3 hours too early... oops, apologies :/ 









 It's obviously impossible... skeletons are *in* us. Without them, we would all be a blob of flesh and muscle on the floor unable to stand up or move. Skeletons are not a threat to humans.

This slavery is produced by ignorance on any of the planes of manifestation (the short list being physical, emotional, intellectual and psychic) and any combination there of. Ignorance is imbalance at best, and many other horrible things at worst.
Competition amongst the slaves of the world for the supposed benefits of further bondage has resulted in an almost penal atmosphere, wherein every breath brings anxiety and fear, and thus agitates and depletes the reserves of energy for the body and the mind to function as a healthy union of the forces.
This condition, of pandemic psychosocial slavery is one that must be overpowered, must be subdued, has to have a ruling decision made over it, and be possessed by the dominion of a new system, superior and victorious for Man and the Forces alike, to bring about the revitalizing and vast expansion of expressions of each, to sustain the world and even turn deserts into paradise.
And towards a paradise on Earth one has lent the ears that heard that the words mystic, occult and magick get thrown around pretty commonly today, and so I wanted to recapitulate how I am wont to believe them to mean.
Mysticism is born from careful observation of impressions through supersensitive channels, both biological, psychological and technological. It can be a state of mind alone, but it is also the observation of that state of mind in the midst of being it.
Occultism thus becomes the correct interpretation of that which can't be seen at the same time what is seen is also interpreted as the effects, causes, or side-effects of the invisible properties and objects of the world. It is engaged through a soulful conscious discrimination between assembling data.
Magick must follow suite and make manifest the practical application of mysticism and occultism; the powers of creation, destruction and transmutation in action at the behest of a will possessed of self-solidarity and worldliness to make things happen or not happen according the truth the magician holds at heart.
Yes, so in measure the mother of invention herself embraces those moments when her offspring manifest the 3 overmentalities. In a word or thrice spoken lesser worlds, finding no other solution to the problem of YOU, decided to feed yourself back to yourself and make you even more YOU, which solved two problems with one philosophy's stone. You couldn't escape yourself, and the world learned all about you while containing you completely in a binding of self-other-self-grammar.
The attempts of the limp world to contain you only fail because it is now seen as a foreign taste which now has to get you to like it too, and you only will if the world becomes you itself, which it will make small concessions too, and progressively, if conditions are correct your central sphere of influence will now have a probability-spreading shell of orbiting factors that serve you because they became you, and being you can't speak to you in anything other than your own voice, so they are themselves mute, and you face the second entrapment.
The breakdown of those orbiting elements in their exposure to an external world that is now less familiar with your ultimate self, is slowly becoming familiar with your extant orbiting self-satellites, and since the world still has to trap you and them it binds them in the same procedure it used to bind you in the beginning. Take heart, the world CANNOT learn, it can only grow and repeat.
Thus you reach the third extension, and the snapping of the leash, that of the world's reflexes becoming your own, and now you can interact with the world through decaying aspects of your own history and new aspects of your present and future, safely for the first time, because now the world can only see itself in you.
Fortunately you think now of an "orange" and the taste of it, and the funny architecture of it, and remember all the arrangements of situations that presented the orange to you, and foresee all the memories of the orange as it is. New tones enter your life and your satellites learn new forms of communication and the amount of acquired information about your universe expands exponentially, taking you to a new level, wherein you become self sustaining in a way that the world no longer can effect.
Thus you have attained a harmonized consciousness. Eternal satisfactions are not yet too far ahead.

 Just imagine.... no more communication(well, cell phones only last until their battery lasts), no more reddit, no running water, no school, no lights at night(oooo spooky :P), etc.

EDIT: This horror lasts for over 5 years. 









 I heard it's the sea-floor of reddit... is that true? 



















 Alright, here's my personal conflict with the horrid SAT. It basically ruined my image.... both to colleges and classmates. I got rejected from most colleges, despite my 4.0 GPA(weighted)/3.8(unweighted).... just because of that stupid SAT score. My classmates made fun of me too. The day of the test, I was very sick and it resulted in a very low score despite having taken(and **wasted over $1000** on SAT prep) 2 SAT prep courses, wasted 2 summers studying hard, and sacrificing regular school studying. All the hard work just to be ruined by this one day.

 Kepler's Laws


Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) developed a quantitative description of the motions of the planets in the solar system. The description that he produced is expressed in three ``laws''.


Kepler's First Law:


The orbit of a planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.


Figure 1 shows a picture of an ellipse. It is constructed by specifying two focus points, F1 and F2, of the ellipse. All points on the ellipse, such as P in Figure 1, have the property that the sum of the distance between P and F1 and the distance between P and F2 is a constant. The dimension of an ellipse is often described by giving its major axis and minor axis. In descriptions of orbits in the solar system, however, it is more common to use the semi-major axis to describe the size of the orbit, and the eccentricity of the ellipse to describe its shape. The eccentricity is given by the ratio of the distance between the two focus points to the length of the major axis of the ellipse. The periapsis, or the shortest distance between the orbiting body and the central mass, is determined by the product of the semi-major axis and the complement of the eccentriciy (1 - e): if the body is orbiting the sun, this is the perihelion, symbolized by q): q = a (1 - e). A circle is a special case of an ellipse, with an eccentricity of 0, or so that q = a.


Kepler's Second Law:


A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.


Figure 2 illustrates Kepler's Second Law. Consider the line between the Sun and point A on the elliptical orbit. After a certain amount of time, the planet will have moved along the orbit to point B, and the line between the Sun and the planet will have swept over the cross hatched area in the figure. Kepler's Second Law states that for any two positions of the planet along the orbit that are separated by the same amount of time, the area swept out in this manner will be the same. Thus, suppose that it takes the planet the same amount of time to go between positions C and D as it did for the planet to go between positions A and B. Kepler's Second Law then tells us that the second cross hatched area between C, D, and the Sun will be the same as the cross hatched area between A, B, and the Sun.


Kepler's Second Law is valuable because it gives a quantitative statement about how fast the object will be moving at any point in its orbit. Note that when the planet is closest to the Sun, at perihelion, Kepler's Second Law says that it will be moving the fastest. When the planet is most distant from the Sun, at aphelion, it will be moving the slowest.


Kepler's Third Law:


The squares of the sidereal periods of the planets are proportional to the cubes of their semimajor axes.


We have defined the semimajor axis of the orbit above, in our discussion of Kepler's First Law. The sidereal period of a planet's orbit is the time that it takes a planet to complete one orbit around the Sun. Kepler discovered a quantitative relationship between these two properties of the orbit. If P is the period of the orbit, measured in years, and a is the semimajor axis of the orbit, measured in Astronomical Units, then


P2 = a3


Newton's Laws


Kepler's Laws are wonderful as a description of the motions of the planets. However, they provide no explanation of why the planets move in this way. Moreover, Kepler's Third Law only works for planets around the Sun and does not apply to the Moon's orbit around the Earth or the moons of Jupiter. Isaac Newton (1642-1727) provided a more general explanation of the motions of the planets through the development of Newton's Laws of Motion and Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation.


Newton's Laws of Motion


One way to describe the motion of an object it to specify its position at different times. Consider the car in Figure 3. We can tell where it is at different times as it travels down a road. It starts at milepost 0. One minute later it is between mileposts 1 and 2 at a distance of about 1.3 miles from the start. Two minutes later, the car has gotten to a distance of about 3.3 miles from the start. In general, we could specify a unique position for the car at any time. For example, we might have written down where the car was at a time 1.5 minutes after the start, and even if we hadn't, we're pretty sure that the car was, in fact, somewhere. Mathematicians call this kind of a relationship a function. When we say that the position of the car is a function of time, it just means that there is a unique location for the car for any time. For a planetary orbit, we can describe the orbit in the same way, by providing the position of the planet along the orbit for all times.


Another useful property for describing motion is the velocity of the object. Velocity is defined to be the change of position with change in time. Thus, for our car moving along the road, we can find the velocity by dividing the distance travelled by the time it takes to travel that distance. In our example, during the first minute, the car travels 1.3 miles along the road. Thus, the car's velocity would be 1.3 miles per minute (or about 78 miles per hour!) on the average during that first minute. It is important to note that physicists are very particular about the definition of velocity, and when we state a velocity we always make a statement about the direction of the motion. In our one dimensional case, this corresponds to my statement that the the car moved along the road. In general, if we were looking at a road map, we might say that the velocity was 1.3 miles per minute towards the East -- if the street ran towards the East. Velocity always is specified by both a value and a direction.


A final useful property for describing motion is the acceleration of the object. Just as the velocity describes the rate of change in the position of the object, the acceleration describes the rate of change of the velocity. In our example, the car moved farther during its second minute of travel than it did during its first minute. The average velocity during the second minute would be 2 miles per minute (120 miles per hour), since the car covered two miles from 1.3 to 3.3 during the one-minute time interval from 1 minute after the start to 2 minutes after the start. The velocity increased a lot (0.7 miles per minute) between the first minute of travel and the second minute of travel, and we describe this change by the acceleration. In this case, the car's velocity increased by 0.7 miles per minute in a time interval of one minute. Thus, we'd say that the average acceleration of the car during this time was 0.7 miles per minute PER MINUTE --- acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity.


Like velocity, acceleration has both a value and a direction implied. In our example, the direction was ``along the road'', but in a more general case, the acceleration is not necessarily in the same direction as the velocity. An especially good example for understanding the solar system is the case of uniform circular motion. Lets consider the case below of a car moving around a circle. The speed is constant in this motion, but the direction is changing continuously -- note the arrows showing the direction of motion in the figure -- so there must be an acceleration here. The acceleration in this special case of circular motion is called the centripetal acceleration. It is always in the direction of the center of the circle, as indicated in the figure, and it has a value, A, of


A = v2 / R


where v is the speed of the object along its circular path, and R is the radius of the circle.


Newton's First Law of Motion:


A body remains at rest or moves in a straight line at a constant speed unless it is acted upon by an outside force.


If you look back at the definition of acceleration, you will see that: (1) a body at rest is not accelerating; and (2) a body moving in a straight line at a constant speed is not accelerating either. Thus, the first law of Newton says that objects do not accelerate unless they are acted upon by an outside force.


Newton's Second Law of Motion:


If a force, F, works on a body of mass M, then the acceleration, A, is given by


F = M A


The first law said that if there is acceleration, then there is a force. Newton's second law gives a quantitative relationship between the force and the acceleration that is observed. The relationship depends on a new property of the object, its mass. The mass is simply a measure of the amount of material in the object; mass is conventionally measured in grams or kilograms. Note that the second law implies that, for a given force, a less massive body will accelerate more than a more massive body. This is consistent with the world you are familiar with. Shove your kid brother, he might move a long way; shove Shaquille O'Neal with the same force and he won't move that far...


Newton's Third Law of Motion:


If one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body exerts an equal and opposite force on the first.


This law is sometimes called the ``Action-Reaction'' law. Consider what happens if you are in one row boat and you pull on a line attached to a second row boat. When you pull the line, you exert a force on the second boat. But, by the third law, the other boat exerts an equal and opposite force back on you. Thus, if the second row boat has a large shipment of bricks in it so it is very heavy, your lighter boat may do all the moving even though you are doing all the pulling.


Implications for the Planets


The elliptical orbits of the planets have such small eccentricities that, to a very good approximation, we can think of them as circles. (Only very precise measurements, like those available to Kepler, are able to detect the difference.) This means that we can use the idea of uniform circular motion to analyze planetary motion. In that section, we revealed that a body in uniform circular motion was constantly accelerating towards the center of its circular track. Thus, according to Newton's first law of motion, there must be a force acting on the planet that is always directed toward the center of the orbit -- that is toward the Sun!


Newton's second law of motion allows us to state what the magnitude of that force must be. The required force is just the mass of the Earth times its acceleration. We know that the acceleration of an object moving in uniform circular motion is A = V2/R. Thus, we can calculate the force that is required to keep the Earth on its circular path and compare it to physical theories about what that force might be. This is what Newton later did, although he did it first for the Moon rather than the Earth, to learn about the force of Gravity.


Finally, let us consider an implication of the ``action-reaction'' law. If there is a force that attracts the Earth toward the Sun, then there must be an equal and opposite force attracting the Sun towards the Earth. Why, then, doesn't the Sun move? The answer is that it does move, but by a very small amount since the mass of the Sun is about half a million times that of the Earth. Thus, when subjected to the equal and opposite force required by the third law, it accelerates about half a million times less than the Earth as well. For this reason, to a very good approximation, we can treat the Sun as stationary in our studies of planetary motion.


Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation


By now you must be wondering: ``What is the Force that keeps the Earth going around the Sun?'' Newton's great discovery was the force of {\sl gravity}, which is an attractive force that occurs between two masses. The Universal Law of Gravitation is usually stated as an equation:


Fgravity = G M1 M2 / r2


where Fgravity is the attractive gravitational force between two objects of mass M1 and M2 separated by a distance r. The constant G in the equation is called the Universal Constant of Gravitation. The value of G is:


G = 6.67 X 10-11 meters3 kilograms-1 seconds-2


Newton's great step was developing this law and using it, with his laws of motion, to explain the motion of lots of different things --- from falling objects to planets. Amazingly, out of these simple and general rules, Newton was able to show that all of Kepler's descriptive laws for orbits followed as a direct consequence.


When you combine Newton's gravitation and circular acceleration, which must balance in order for the object to remain in orbit, you get a nice relation between the period, distance, and mass of the central body. It beings by equating the centripetal force (Fcent) due to the circular motion to the gravitational force (Fgrav): Fgrav = Fcent


Fgrav = G m1 m2 / r2
Fcent = m2 V2 /r


Let the Earth be m1 and the Moon be m2. For circular motion the distance r is the semi-major axis a. The orbital velocity of the Moon can be described as distance/time, or circumference of the circular orbit divided by the orbital period:


V = 2 pi r /P


so setting the forces equal yields


G m1 m2 / a2 = m2 V2 /a


note that the m2 will cancel, so that circular orbital motion is independent of the mass of the orbiting body!


G m1 / a2 = ((2 pi a)2/P2)/a


which we rearrange to place all the a-terms on the right and all the P-terms on the left:


G m1/(4 pi2) P2 = a3


which should look startlingly like Kepler's third law, but this time for the Earth's mass (or any other) instead of the sun's mass. To use a and P to solve for mass, manipulate once more so that


m1 = a3 (4 pi2/G) / P2

 The end of the button is near. Eventually grey will become the most desirable and rare color. *It pays to stay pure in the end* 




 Yeah... it was once 2015. 




 Ok, so I got out of school, and for some strange reason it was already night-time. Just then, me and a group of students and teachers noticed a close-up flying plane that was flying in strange patterns. It wasn't flying stable, it it sometimes went in circles. A few times it even flipped back and flew backwards. Next thing we knew, it took a dive and crashed nearby... there was no huge explosion but still a loud crash. Everyone was apathic about it though.... just talking about it. Just then, like 4 other planes started flying in strange patterns.... ends here.

p.s. It was a lucid dream. 




 CONFIRMED 




 GgG 




 Show me your stuff. 




 Thanks, I'm gonna look forward into buying one like that :) 




 Someday, grey will be the most desirable... trust me. *Stay pure*

 Yes, it is now April 30th 2016 









 Yes! Those of us who can resist the temptation to press will be saved! :)

 Yeah... maybe. But my physics teacher is the least strict teacher I have... he's very lenient. Maybe it was just a random strange dream. 




 I'm a guy... actually. I like cute and innocent-looking girls.... 




 Yeah... the Rat is a god down here... AIEYAIEYAIEYAIEYAIEY!!! {:'-D 




 *Gasp*... apologies... 




 It's ok... no worries

 I just thought of a great idea for the sub.... this thread could be for posting many basement pictures, of different areas. I have posted some already. 









 Thanks :) 




 It's kinda cool... I'd love to have a moth tattoo with the soft texture able to be felt :) 




 What does it mean? 




 Nope.

 Heyy 




 One very disturbing dream I had when I was 4, was that I bit off someone's tounge and ate it... *I was only 4.* 




 It has no relevance to your relationship(at least it shouldn't, in my opinion). 




 A 




 I also used to have many dreams involving my body parts falling off... my eyes, fingers, arms, etc. Probably just strange dreams, or maybe worrying about that particular body part's health? 




 Why!?

Ok, so in the dream I was able to summon a cow(with horns) that came out of the floor(breaking the floor). It didn't actually hurt people, but it did cause a bit of destruction. So I summoned it during school, and it came out of the floor but just then my physics teacher came! A huge pool of water just appeared out of nowhere(about 30 feet deep) and my physics teacher wrestled the cow to death(he killed the cow in the pool). WTF!? I know my physics teacher isn't capable of doing that in real life! He's a good guy! Whyyy oh **whyyyyyyy!!??**

EDIT: Also whenever the cow appeared, classic country music started playing. 




 Ok, so I was sitting outside, and all of the sudden a moth looking similar to a gypsy moth flew right towards my right forearm and embeded itself into my skin. It was just slightly painful, but the moth's soft texture could be felt when you ran your fingers over it. Why?? Oh why!!?? :D 




 Yay... looks like our hopes are up again. 












































 Any ideas on how to solve it? I've tried decoding/encoding in many ways, but nothing seems to crack it. I don't know why I'm starting to feel this sub-phase is gonna be much harder than we thought... I mean, they do look like the codes A858 posts... and they haven't been solved yet. But I hope I'm wrong.

 Does anyone know how images like the duck one were derived? 




 I really wish I knew... 




 Oh no... you're right. We should maybe refer to it as phase 2.1(flashing gif with 5 and red/green boxes, )phase 2.2(binary with picture), phase 2.3(A858-like codes), etc. 




 She never got annoyed at me.... maybe she just suddenly didn't like me anymore? 




 But does it mean you hate the guy? 




 But thats not what he's asking... lol... click on the pic of snoo and it'll take you to some post... 




 I wonder what happens when we complete the last phase.... 




 Some cool flairs might be like trophies(for users who solve a ~~phase~~ page/part of a phase), and for regular use... maybe small pics from the website might be cool? 




 Hmmm.... by the way, for phase 5, the code looks similar to the codes posted by A858... maybe whoever solves this phase, might also reveal the key to solving A858... it seems hard though. 




 6.Password: 70325

Solved by Ryuk_ on IRC Explanation: He used the 1001st Fibonacci number, and got the first 5 digits (70330) and substracted 5 from it.

I don't understand.... why the Fibonacci number? 




 That happened to me too... use google chrome, and it should get fixed. 




 Richard Johnson 




 Why do girls do that? Is it because they think a guy is starting to like them? 




 It's because of your cute smile and with your eyes, it makes you look so innocent! When most people see you, it's similar to the feeling one gets when they look at cute things like [this](http://www.godity.com/content/img/4/469.jpg). I personally love innocent-looking girls! Just saying...lol

p.s. I love those bushy bangs :)

 Siperachu cheema cheema bararraga 




 HOLY COW!!! {:'-D 




 Thanks... I'll try that and hopefully I am able to figure out the answers. 




 Oh yeah nice idea :) 




 Hi, I was wondering if anyone knew how to solve these? I honestly have no idea how to do it and am very bad at physics. Thanks for the help.

This is the link for the simulator, which idk how to use: http://astro.unl.edu/naap/pos/animations/kepler.html

These are the questions:

 This girl I knew last year... I started talking to her and we became friends. Every time she saw me in the school hallways, she said hi and smiled. We also did this peace-thingy with the 2 fingers. But one day near the end of the year, I waved at her to say "hi" and she just looked away. The year ended.... and this year started. I saw her two times in the hallway and she just looked away as if she doesn't know me. What the hell? I mean, I didn't have a crush on her but why pretend she doesn't know me even after long time no see?

 Go explore NSFW subreddits.... 




 Omg, you're so cute and innocent-looking! 




 I'm a noob too

 I wish 20141220 was still here... he was good at stuff like this. 




 I think I have a crush on you.... 




 So so far it's been going on for just 6 days? 




 Since when has this been going on? Was the website discovered only recently? 




 Welcome to the grey crew.

 Here's some [cute thing...](http://www.godity.com/content/img/4/469.jpg)

 Trust me... it was. I was glad when I finally graduated. 




 Very cute actually. 




 HOLY COW!!! {:'-D 




 HOLY COW!!! {:'-D 




 Yeah... it was so traumatic 




 Oh no :) 




 It reminds me of when a boy and a girl were forced to kiss in the middle school playground... do it do it do it do it do it kiss kiss kiss ... ugh 




 Yeah, who cares about losing one kid when you can have more :) 




 Whatever happens, don't press it. 




 Don't press at all. 




 I got a headshot :) 




 Thanks :) AP Physics is just beyond my ability.... 




 See... that's why you shouldn't press. 




 I agree... everyone should refrain from pressing PLEASE!!! 




 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 




 Ah... I can see your intentions...

 Ooooo spooky ;-) 




 Guaranteed! 




 Ah, slow and painful, eh? :) 




 SERIOUSLY, am I the only one who knows about this spambot taking down websites? It certainly took down legacy.smartstocks.com.... I witnessed it.... hence my name.... 




 Poisonous radiation, anyone? 




 True...

 This is quite interesting.... I had forgotten to mention it before. [This guy named John Titor](http://johntitor.strategicbrains.com/) predicts there will be nuclear war in 2015...

 I created a sub which includes samples of Dairelldz's inter-website spams. It can also be used for more discussion about the spambots.

 Ahhh yess 




 I am A858 I certainly agree with this article. 




 Yeah I agree... everyone wants to lose it at ages below 18... even us, but we resist :) 




 That's not p0rn 







































 Some kid back in sixth grade supposedly put a "spell" on me... the next day I unexpectedly got very sick. It was probably a coincidence, although back then it seemed as if the spell was real. 




 Much more complicated than it looks, eh? 
























 Thanks :)

 Ooooo spooky 




 Here's the actual website

http://www.gateway-71.com/ 














 That's what we are trying to find out... 




 Hmmm, great idea! I hadn't thought of that! 









 Alright... I'll take a look at it tomorrow... 




 I was thinking maybe start codes of my own for people to crack... not sure if that's a good idea. 









 No :) 




 It turned me on :/ (blushing) 




 There's no way :) 














 What's up, 20141220.... 














 Thanks... I found it here in the United States. It probably will come out soon o.O 












































 I'll be honest... I figured it out, though I doubt I'm the enlightened one. I kept it to myself, but someone else also figured it out and posted it. 




 I'd put my shoe on and kick it in the eye :) 




 My posts are NOT spam... they are actual solvable codes. 




 How??? 




 Why this particular phrase? 




 Most likely guts. 




 We have yet to find out...... 




 It's a master-gif. 









 It's a hamster poop. 




 Oh no :D 




 DOOT DOOT :) 




 Some horrible place. 














 As a reminder, this subreddit is also the place to submit any experiences with the SAT, opinions of why it should be eliminated, or simply posts saying how much you hate the SAT. If it's against the SAT, don't hesitate to submit! 









 Oh... that's strange... well, at least ye trRried!  




 Nope, I'll give ye a hint,,, one is a video and the otherRe is a picturRre... ;-) 














 But what do the codes translate to? 




 I guess...  




 I'll try next time I see her, thanks :) Hopefully I'm not too nervous, lol.... 




 What is it? :) 




 It's like the 5th time we saw each other and we met on 2/5/15..... we barely see each other since we have no classes together and the school is huge. Should I be alarmed? 
























 G^g ggg gGg ggg! 



















 Gggg :) 









 It's like when the white stuff squirts out.... 




 OH GOD! {:'-D 




 Dammm... she's so hot... 




 Until the eyes blink and the lambs start screaming in pain... 














 Why is there a hot naked woman laying on the snow?

 I wish I were you. 









 Not many people join my subreddits, despite the cool CSS... and I'm like the only one who posts. Is there a way to put my subreddits more out there? 




 I am sunk in the depths of failure, as of now.

 Proof? 




 Nope... 




 Yeah... the eye in real life is actually the eye of a calf. 




 Dude, you're lucky. She most likely likes you and is just very nervous when near you. The best thing to do next time you see her is to go up to her and be like "Hey, whatsup..." 




 Yes, this is very true. 




 Similar situation... except that we met about 4 months ago, but we've only seen each other like 5 times because we have no classes together and the school is huge...  














 ooooo spooky... 









 I wonder why :( 




 It's not a single bot... it's like thousands of bots, but Dairelldz is the main one. 




 Doot Doot 




 Nah... it's just natural. 




 Oh... 




 I'm gonna check it out! 









 This is calming... more than I initially expected... ahhh 




 If only you had waited just a bit longer :'( 




 Sulfur 




 It probably is.... 





























 It's unknown yet... we're trying to somehow decode the codes. 









 Is it because of what it says at the bottom? 




 I don't know... I wonder that too 




 D: 









 I know, I feel that emptiness too. 




 Even after trying many different decoders, I can't crack it! I've been using this:

http://encoders-decoders.online-domain-tools.com/

But I better take a rest from this frustration for now. 




 MAJOR DISCOVERY: The bloody-eyed Snoo is gone!!! 




 I noticed that phase 1 has been failed D:  Also there's a countdown... probably the time we have left to complete the phase. 




 Because it is getting to more and more websites. Each website it gets to, it "conquers" and takes down. It will probably end up taking down the whole internet.... 




 Time to delete my account. 



















 This is so frustrating }:| 




 Trash 




 Hope the world won't end. 




 Anything. 




 Stab my knee-cap.

 Holy cow, I tried decoding the last line as base64, and look:

(NjA5MTA=) = (60910) = (6/09/10) 




 Oh yes my friend, oh yes. 




 Yes, but they usually just decode to numbers. 




 I'm not afraid ;-) 




 "ping!" 




 We want something. 









 LOL... I honestly found it funny! 




 Oh... I guess we need better moderation in the subreddit.

 In middle school... my old music teacher tripped, fell of the stage, cracked her head, and splashed blood.... then a couple just made out. Completely messed up.

 Honestly, you turned me on... *blushing* 




 Big disaster now awaits. 




 Why? It's hot. 




 This reminds me of how I never got to say my last words to the girl I liked back in 8th grade.

 Mr. Skeltal and his skeletons are not the true enemy! They are simply trying to protect us against the fuccboy helicopters and their leader... the giant bi-gender non-virgin infant!

 You're back to the soft posts, eh?

By replacing the **[specific number]** with a number like 2, 4, 15, etc., you will be taken to another picture in the website.


**NOTE:** Some numbers like 1, 3, 16, 17, 18, 19, etc., will lead you to pages like [this](http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/1.jpg) because not every number has its own picture. Try other higher numbers like 31, 33, etc.

 Oh no :)

 "...All this was a long time ago, I remember,

And I would do it again, but set down

This set down

This: were we led all that way for

Birth or Death? There was a Birth, certainly,

We had evidence and no doubt. I had seen birth and

death,

But had thought they were different; this Birth was

Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.

We returned to our places, these Kingdoms,

But no longer at ease here, in the old dispensation,

With an alien people clutching their gods.

I should be glad of another death." 




 Resist 




 How do you know?  



















 Oh yes 




 I feel that way about the SAT.

 Oooops, I typed it wwrong! 




 Pressers gather, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no color, hold no flair, flaunt no number. I shall wear no zero and win no karma. I shall live and die at my post. I am the cursor in the darkness. I am the watcher on the Web. I am the grey that shields against the color, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the moderators, the shield that guards the realms of white flairs. I pledge my life and honor to the Grey's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.

**EDIT:** BRLI is probably gonna be going back up now(2:25), based on it's graph pattern and that change in direction it made a few minutes ago.

 It was an accident... he was aiming for the helicopter... 




 Why, my friend? Mr.Skeltal is a good guy. 









 Out of curiosity, what would you say to u/20141220? 




 Why!?


Ok, so in the dream I was able to summon a cow(with horns) that came out of the floor(breaking the floor). It didn't actually hurt people, but it did cause a bit of destruction. So I summoned it during school, and it came out of the floor but just then my physics teacher came! A huge pool of water just appeared out of nowhere(about 30 feet deep) and my physics teacher wrestled the cow to death(he killed the cow in the pool). WTF!? I know my physics teacher isn't capable of doing that in real life! He's a good guy! Whyyy oh **whyyyyyyy!!??**


EDIT: Also whenever the cow appeared, classic country music started playing. 




 My physics teacher killed a cow...

 Oh and then there was this very creepy satanic-like girl who never got in trouble for her wrong actions/words.

 Whooooo kneEewwwww


 ItTt's trueeeeeeee

 




 Yeah, lol. It's hilarious! 




 Don't go, trust me. 




 I've been through much worse, don't worry. 




 I'd wish I were you, trust me. You are very very lucky. 




 OH GOD!!! LOL 




 D: 




 Avengers 









 Maybe he's gonna go after the person that downloads them... oooo spooky. 









 Cat. 




 /r/huehuehuehuehuehuehue 









 That monster must be executed at once! 




 Yeah I have a feeling Frozen 2 is gonna be a mess.... 




 Night at the museum 









 /u/trollabot smartstocks 




 Alright, things seem to be ok for now... 




 Sorry, something strange happened. It was supposed to be down by now, I don't know what happened....  it even says here.....


http://www.howthemarketworks.com/stock-market-game/create-a-contest.php 




 That can't be D: It's supposed to be down... it even says here.....

http://www.howthemarketworks.com/stock-market-game/create-a-contest.php 




 I honestly don't know... lol. It's a mysterious website... try asking these guys at the bottom of this page by clicking "enter"

 Try here...

http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/coloured%20site/start/evokation/the_evokation.htm 




 Did you find the indexes? 




 There's a link to a website on the sidebar.... 




 I posted it just now... 




 Even better.... 




 Yep, i'm posting it in a moment now. 




 A few more replies, and it'll go up. 




 Nope, even more interesting... it involves a website. 




 If I get enough replies, I'll edit this post with the link to a certain subreddit ;-)

EDIT: Here it is... 
/r/Amazein973EhtNamuh973 




 I agree... it helps prevent roommates from staring at you all night! 




 The class is a waste of time, honestly. 




 100% true 




 I have a sub involving a website you guys might find interesting....

/r/Amazein973EhtNamuh973 




 Wait... it should be going down this evening or very early tomorrow in some parts of the world. 




 Ooooh yummy! 




 lol xD 




 Oh... but some guy makes it so wild, that the subreddit is like bouncing all over the place D: 




 If only we could get more people here.... 




 Thank Mr Skeltal 




 Is it a wise idea? Should it be eliminated? etc. 




 Confirmed! lol 









 Holy cow {:'-D WHAT IS GOING ON!?

/u/-Energy 




 Nice ;) 




 Great! 














 Great idea! 




 Thanks :) 




 Yeah... 









 I will rid the world of the SAT

/r/nomoresat 




 I wish I were smart enough to create an app. 




 Yeah...  




 /r/Moderatoria used to be like that, but then some bad mods started breaking the sub... that's why our permissions were reduced. 




 Nope... they don't have full permissions except 2 of them... but they haven't been here in a while.... 




 Well, /r/Moderatorium is not completely broken... mods can still be added there.... 









 Oh buddy ;-; if only I had full permissions as a mod... I could fix things! 




 Someone is messing with the subs :( 




 /r/moderatorium 




 Come on.... lets just take care of it and leave it the way it is. 




 I used this wonderful website:

http://encoders-decoders.online-domain-tools.com/ 




 What's a meta subreddit? 




 Thanks :) 




 What is "meta"? 




 Probably death. Who knows? Anything can happen. 




 If only I were smart enough -_- 




 doot doot {:'-D 




 I could doot all night long! doot doot doot doot! 




 Oh Mr. Skeltal thank you thank you thank you!!! 



















 LOL :) 




 Yeah... I like the less intensive one... I wonder how people are able to post in the one that moves... 




 Nope... 3 missing characters at the end.... 




 Nope... it's just the CSS... 




 That's not a secret sub though... it's a mess because we made the mistake of adding too many mods. 




 Search up bro ;) But i'll give you a big hint for another.... it's called "nameaser___" 




 It'll probably happen around evening... or in some parts of the world on July 1. 




 Yeah, www.howthemarketworks.com has been conquered by spambots of Dairelldz(come here for more info /r/Dairelldz) and will shut down forever on 6/30/15... I'm 100% sure. Check now, then on 6/30/15 if you don't believe me. 




 Congratulations, you have found one of the 4 super secret subreddits. 









 Welcome to the abandoned subreddit. 




 CONFIRMED 









 Dammm that's even worse than  /r/enoch :O 




 Yeah, poor /u/20141220 :( he suffered a lot. That's why he doesn't want to come back... 




 I actually forgot, but it's supposed to be a picture! 




 Truly :) 




 Savisniepachut 




 Maybe ask for his/her number ;) IMO she/he doesn't reddit too often... lol 




 There is now one ;) 




 LOL :) 




 Some surrealistic artist. 
























 :) 




 The professional diver tried to dive into the tiny pool two miles below, but missed the center a hit his head on a corner. 




 {:'-D 




 No 




 I crashed {:'-D 




 Ooops 




 It's too late now {:'-D 




 OH GOD!! D: EMERGENCY!! EMERGENCY!!!!!!!!!!!! {:'-D 




 Do people meet up to play, or like how do they play? 




 How is that possible!? 









 Correct 









 Thanks :) 




 What are those tournaments about? 




 Well, it still exists... but it's not in use ;) 




 I can't XD 









 Maybe we should ask the other mods to see how we could modify the sub? 




 Yep... we gotta find someone who is good with CSS... i'm a noob... lol 




 In the future, we might get someone to make the button blue so it is more visible :) 




 But does it turn black when you click it? 




 Maybe... I tried posting a link to this sub at /r/ButtonAftermath to see if the people left there might be interested? 




 I'm still trying to see what I can do to make the community grow... we might still have a chance. 




 I guess you're right... I was too quick to judge. 









 Even /r/buttonaftermath is nearly abandoned now... 




 That's the most twisted individual I have heard of yet, I mean, what kind of person with a good life does that? Dammmmmm 




 Happy birthday ;)

p.s. A day late, but better late then never! ;) 




 Because each second that passes, it leads closer to my death. 




 Yep. 









 I agree... quite an offensive word, eh? 




 Oh, it truly is! 




 Nah... I think people consider it a phrase, so it's probably not on the dictionary... 




 You're welcome. 




 HarRrdee harRr harRr ;-) 




 Excellent choice. 









 Diarrhea   




 Suck... even babies can do that. 




 ...She wants to be your cook now. 




 /r/NoMoreSAT 




 Honestly the graders might give it like around a 9-11, though it deserves a 12 due to the very short time they give.

Don't you wish students didn't have to go through this?

/r/NoMoreSAT 




 I am quite offended by this comment. 




 {:'-D 




 Communism. 




 What quality food do they eat? 




 What do you think? 




 ...She wants your eggroll. 









 {:'-D 














 I'm just gonna remove this post to prevent lots of other people asking for mod-position...  we wouldn't want it to end up like /r/moderatorium... lol 









 LOL... the lunch-lady has no guts to stand up for herself. 




 Rollercoaster 




 Doot Doot 




 :)

 ELI5, I5 TH4T Y0U??? 




 Oh very yes. 




 You'll get the invitation soon... 




 Hey, for the lunch-lady sub, does mod# matter or just as long as you're a mod? 




 Don't worry, if anyone demods anyone, they'll be demodded and you'll get re-invited :) 









 {:'-D 









 Do you really want to be 2nd/3rd or it doesn't really matter as long as you get mod? 




 Interesting... 




 Disaster 




 {:'-D 




 Ohhh I just swallowed my pen, ohh ohh... :( 




 Woah! :D 




 3 




 Hey, what's up 




 Oh I see... someone de-modded you but it wasn't me... I promise. It was u/18custodioj	 who de-modded a bunch of people. Don't worry though...  I invited  you to mod again. 




 I can't... I can't access the sub. Someone messed it up :( 




 I don't... please tell me. Is it because of the sub? 




 Dude, you're famous at /r/moderatorium, congratz :) 




 This is serious though... I'm not even joking. 




 ...she has fallen and is screaming "MAHMAHHHH!"

*p.s. She needs help* 




 ...she wants your DNA son. 




 ...she wants you man. 




 ...she wants to go out to lunch with you bro. 




 ...she misses you. 




 I may act like a fool at times, but that's just to take my focus away from the true horror. 




 Trust me... it's far worse than what /u/20141220 predicted. The moon and water will turn to blood, the government will become worse than the Nazis, millions will starve to death, the sun shall burn the skin, and eventually the world will be covered in flames. This is no ARG my friends, this is real. No one knows when this tribulation will start, but it could start any time. 

**EDIT:** [PROOF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Moon_Prophecy)
 




 Jeevees 




 Great idea.. lol... i'll think it through for a while... lol 




 Thanks :) any ideas on how I should decide who gets modded first? lol 




 Alright, but with restricted permissions :)

I just gotta find a way to chose who goes on top of who... 




 Alright, but with restricted permissions :)

I just gotta find a way to chose who goes on top of who... 




 Why? 




 Thank you, dear friend :) 




 It's not my mom, it's some other lady. 




 Cool :) 




 ... she misses you. 




 That's great :) 




 Anyone else out there??? {:'-D 









 Actually, some people think i'm a god... 




 {:'-D 




 Why? 



















 Add to reduce, reduce to deduce. 




 Oh thank you so much. 




 Maybe... 




 I'll be dead by then man. 




 But most likely we won't survive. 




 Maybe... 




 My subreddit is

/r/TheLunchLadyCalled

There are a bit of things i'd like to fix:

1. The name of the sub to appear on the header, without it being an uploaded picture

2. The text in the red and purple submit boxes to be aligned in the middle

3. The "mail icon" to stop being a green box and actually be a mail icon


Thanks so much, and I appreciate any help. 




 Sadly we were left behind... the truth is... we're all going to die :( 




 Correct... the world has no idea of the horrors that await in the near future... 




 Am I in danger? :D 




 CONFIRMED :) 




 /r/april30th2016 is in distress :O 




 You deserve to know. 









 What do you believe his name will be? 




 Maths will need us :) 




 /u/20141220? 




 Mistake...

 4x4=8

4x4=16 in 16 years it'll be 2031. world ending 2031 confirmed :) 




 Woah... awesomeness :D 




 Nope, you're quite normal. 









 {:'-D 




 Oh yeah... nice idea :) 




 Yes, he violated the cow's b-hole... haven't you heard of that story? 




 Yeah, the internet went down in my area and certain lights stopped working... *it is happening slowly* 




 CONFIRMED 




 Any plans? 




 The witch will stink for eternity... 




 It has to be dirty too :) 




 The ghost who has never showered since birth... LOL 




 "I feel as though I have written this myself."

It just won't go away! 




 Nope 




 In that case... that hole should be ripped ;)
