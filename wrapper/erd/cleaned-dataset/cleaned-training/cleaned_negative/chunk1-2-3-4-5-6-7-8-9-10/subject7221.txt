 I installed successfully an Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite in my Dell Optiplex 780 with GeForce GT 430 through Clover.
Only using loadvbios option. 




 Just uninstall beta and remove rpetri.ch repo. The 1.9.1 version of Activator will show in search. 




 At the 1.9.2 beta 1 (reading the changelog) seems that the Touch ID force was disabled by the dev Ryan Petrich... It means that is not possible use it without an event. I dont understand why (possibly battery drain). 




 Nobody fucks with the Jesus. 




 Its a bug with Activator within the new update (1.8.4~rc1 at Ryan Petrich repo)... I think it will be corrected after new update in a few days. 




 Moranguinho desastrado.  




 kkk 




 nope. any conflicts and I use Jellylock7 togheter on lockscreen. I just remove the Forecast option "Show Current Weather" cause IntelliscreenX shows at the top screen.

 Natively only Air Print ready printers are supported in iOS. TruPrint was a tweak that make possible send to a big number of network printers, but its devs didnt update since iOS6.

The PDF printer for Safari (never was natively, only inside apps) at Cydia dont work with iOS 7, wait for an update too. 




 Well, it would be so much usefull, the tweaks that support those functionality are not compatible with ios 7. 




 It could be nice! air print ready printers are so few...

 Try to remove the repo and uninstall activator 1.9.3 beta. The stock 1.9.2 version should work for you.

 A team from the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science, along with collaborators from several Japanese institutions, have successfully produced pairs of spin-entangled electrons and demonstrated, for the first time, that these electrons remain entangled even when they are separated from one another on a chip. This research could contribute to the creation of futuristic quantum networks operating using quantum teleportation, which could allow information contained in quantum bits-qubits-to be shared between many elements on chip, a key requirement to scale up the power of a quantum computer. The ability to create non-local entangled electron pairs -- known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs -- on demand has long been a dream. 



















 1. There Are Ads  Apple never mentioned this and youd be surprised considering how rich it is, but occasionally little promotional messages like Beats 1 is made possible by American Express play on the air.

2. The Music Selection Is All Over The Place  Hardcore drumnbass dance music is immediately followed by serene singer/songwriter crooning, followed by loud and jangly rocknroll. Youll need very eclectic tastes to enjoy all of it.

3. Zane Lowe Loves The Sound Of His Own Voice  The London DJ whos the face of Beats 1 frequently talked over the songs he played, dropping the brand name, excitedly cheering on his own selections, mentioning tour dates, or repeatedly reminding users that Beats 1 is WORLDWIDE!. Twitter has flooded with complaints about his interruptions.

4. Song Will Be Censored  Apple wants to keep Beats 1 family-friendly. So even when it dropped a song by Apple SVP Dr. Dre, it aggressively bleeped out objectionable words or whole lines.
