 As a vegan can confirm that this idea works :)
 




 Awesome list! This is my heaven!! :) 



























































 Also vegan friendly bread is Abbotts and Helga's (not the gluten free though) and Bakers Delight have a lot of vegan friendly bread/rolls they will check which ones if you ask :) 




 You must check out Prahran Convenience or IGA and grab Gardein products.  At woolies grab the fry's products in the dairy part the snags and hotdogs are the bomb! I'm vegan and thats what I eat....a lot :) Also for organic stuff the Fruit Peddlers in Northcote have everything you need as well. http://thefiveminuteguide.com.au/2013/11/14/the-fruit-peddler/ - https://www.facebook.com/pages/Prahran-Convenience/327183647396414 - http://www.frysvegetarian.com.au/ - https://www.facebook.com/gardeinaustralia
