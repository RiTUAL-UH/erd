Same flair already granted in [/r/Science] (http://www.reddit.com/r/science). 




 Agreed. These bonds between receptor and ligand also have differing association/dissociation constants, meaning the ligand/receptor can be together for varying amounts of time. Some very short, some nearly permanent. This all has to do with the relative associative forces bringing the molecules together, and it's balance with the repulsive forces pulling them apart. Things like electrical charge, simple diffusion, conformational changes in the receptor shape...they all can help push things back apart, and work against the non-covalent bonds that are formed. 




 Capsaicin is a strong activator of a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel called TRPV1. This channel is found on sensory nerves and plays a role in nerve signal conduction. The neat thing about capsaicin is that it is also a strong desensitizer of TRPV1 - so much so that it can actually cause the amount of TRPV1 protein expressed on sensory nerves to decrease for extended periods of time. Less TRPV1 = less sensitivity to capsaicin = less burning-mouth perceived by you. I mean, it's not really "hot"; it's just perceived as such due to activation of TRPV1 channels. No TRPV1 means bland food, no matter how much capsaicin you put in it. 




 Euchre. Well-known in the Midwest US, but otherwise not so much (it seems). Three and 4 player iterations exist.  
























 Interesting question, and I am sorry your tutor vastly over-simplified the answer. It is true that inter-cellular space is nearly nonexistent, as the role of an epithelium is as a barrier. But, it is not true that they only excrete substances. Epithelial cells can express a myriad of transporters, ion channels, and pores that allow all sorts of different things into, out of, and through the epithelial cells. It varies based on the epithelial type in question.

I am wondering one thing, though: to me, the epithelium I think of last is the skin (I research the urinary bladder for a living). The questions you bring up here seem to be related to "transport" across the epidermis' stratum corneum (outer layer of skin) and not an epithelium in the more general sense.
 
The stratum corner is a pretty tight barrier against a lot of stuff, but it is still made up of cells with hydrophobic membranes...so many hydrophobic compounds and lipophilic small molecules are more than happy to alter the cell membrane stiffness and pliability and/or pass right through. Thus, most of the moisturizers you use aren't really imparting water, per se...but imparting elasticity and flexibility. 

As far as the patches and lead and mercury and stuff? Some patches increase permeability chemically, some have special formulations of the drugs that allow them to pass through the cells, and some just rely on simple diffusion of tiny molecules that are intrinsically capable of passing through the skin. The heavy metals you speak of, as inorganic ions, aren't particularly well-absorbed (IMO)...however, organic molecules containing lead and mercury are EXTREMELY well-absorbed through the stratum corneum and EXTREMELY toxic. Again, this is because of the lipophilicity of the organic compound and thus it's ability to basically pass right through the cell membranes. 




 Well, in the simple sense, if your ic50 values are within the confidence intervals of the ic50 values reported  elsewhere, then it seems you could attest that your values are not significantly different from the original values. I can't think of a statistically legitimate way to make the comparison between 2 separate groups without at least knowing the variance within one of the groups. Then you can see if your value fits within that variance.  




 Comparisons without replicates is not really the best idea, IMO.  But when I do this (for EC50, but essentially the same thing), I always use -log(EC50). You can't really average EC50 or IC50 as they are, since on a logarithmic scale...let alone calculate reliable SEM. It's explained well [here] (http://www.graphpad.com/guides/prism/6/curve-fitting/index.htm?reg_why_prism_fits_the_logec50_rat.htm). 




 Something else...the "effects" of which you speak are either due to TRPV1-expressing sensory nerves near your rectum, or due to inflammation in response to large, local release of neurotransmitters due to nerve activation. Interestingly, from a pharmacological perspective, menthol and capsaicin are really doing the exact same thing: opening an ion channel that is depolarizing a sensory nerve. The fact that we perceive it as cold vs. hot is merely coincidental...so, sadly, no balance. Might actually feel WORSE, given the circumstances. :) 
























 I think the more interesting thing here is knowing that it's an adenosine receptor blocker that's affecting mood and memory, not so much that it's caffeine. Caffeine does a myriad of other things (blocks some important receptors, agonizes others), but knowing that Adenosine 2A receptors mediate these effects on mood is critical to drug development of new, more specific agents. Perhaps this leads to an entirely new class of antidepressants? 




 Every process in your entire body is ultimately regulated by only 4 ions: Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl-. 
 




 Amusing, yet extraordinarily accurate. Unfortunately, I think "Overselling" has almost become commonplace...that is, if you want a chance at funding. Yes, sometimes what we do as scientists is esoteric and incremental - but that doesn't mean it isn't exceptionally important.  But hey, we can't all cure cancer with every grant application or paper. It's too bad we don't always just say that. 




 Baroreceptors, in this instance, likely have nothing to do with it...That's part of a autonomic circuit used to regulate heart rate and cardiac output relative to changes is BP. To my knowledge, there aren't any baroreceptors in the ocular arterioles.

Ocular vessels narrow due to something called "myogenic tone", or "pressure-induced constriction". The smooth muscle cells in these vessels are able to sense stretch caused by increases in pressure and constrict accordingly. No neural innervation is required; even a single isolated smooth muscle cell would constrict when stretched. The development of this myogenic tone protects the extremely fragile capillary bed from rupture due to high pressures, since capillaries themselves are extremely thin (1 layer of endothelial cells only) and non-contractile.

Pressure COULD get high enough to widen vessels instead, since the myogenic capability of smooth muscle reaches a plateau...but that pressure would need to be pretty dangerously high for that to happen.

I could wax poetic about how this increase in tone ultimately leads to remodeling of the vessel wall, decreased distensibility, and vascular dysfunction, but I won't...unless you want me to. (c: 
























 Reuptake is saturable: a finite amount of glucose can be taken back up at a time. The amount of glucose in the blood in the absence of insulin exceeds the amount that transporters can move per unit time. Thus, out goes the glucose...and out goes water with it, for that matter. 




 I'm a vascular physiologists, so know that my response is definitely from that perspective - and not from the neuroscience perspective. That being said, my guess is that the cause of dehydration-induced headaches is two-fold:

(1) Dehydration decreases blood volume, which causes blood vessels in the body to constrict to maintain blood pressure at a high enough level to properly deliver oxygen/nutrients to your organs. This includes vessels in your head (outside of the skull), which might lead to headache.

(2) Your brain will do anything and everything to maintain blood flow to it, even at the expense of the rest of your body. So, when a drop blood volume also lowers blood pressure, the vessels in your brain do the opposite from the rest of the body: they dilate. Cerebral vessel dilation has also been attributed to development of "throbbing" headaches.

On a side note - exactly how vascular changes cause the headache is still debated, since it seems that both vasodilation and vasoconstriction result in head pain. Somewhere along the line, these vascular changes activate pain-sensing nerve fibers, but several mechanisms for that activation have been hypothesized. We're trying to figure it out, I promise. (c:

 It seems like Tim Hunt is not the only person to say wholly irrational, sensational and unfounded statements after winning the Nobel: [James Watson](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/fury-at-dna-pioneers-theory-africans-are-less-intelligent-than-westerners-394898.html), for example? 




 As far as benefits go, I think that's constantly evolving - take the paper in question, for example. There are thousands of papers citing the benefits of caffeine in everything from gallstones to Parkinson's disease. Most all of this, however is correlation and not causal relationships...it's still unclear (in my opinion) the link between caffeine and all these other maladies. I think the benefits readily accepted right now are the ability of caffeine to increase alertness and act as a vasodilator; t's also used for some very specific airway disorders. But this is balanced against the diuretic effects, the dependence potential, the increase in heart rate, headache, and the jittery feelings people get. As with most anything, though, the dangers go up as the dose goes up. 
























 The answer is a resounding 'maybe'. 

Like so many science things, there isn't yet a clear answer...but it does appear that, under certain conditions (like dehydration), the urothelial cells that line the bladder can express "aquaporins". Aquaporins are essentially pores in the cell wall that allow movement of water across a cell membrane. These are the same kind of pores that are in the renal tubules to allow reabsorption of water in the kidney. 

But, a lot of the work examining this is in cultured human urothelial cells, and bladders from rodents. More work needs to be done to see when and if these aquaporins contribute significantly to water or sodium reabsorption from the bladder. Truly, there has been a lot of interest lately in the role of the urothelium in regulating bladder function, and it appears that it isn't just a barrier that's impervious to urine like we originally thought.

 Lyme disease? I can't imagine that any physician or hospital ethics board would let someone be put in a medically-induced coma for Lyme  disease...but I could be wrong.

The protocol was designed for Rabies treatment of patients who did not receive the Rabies vaccine in time. Rabies is an awful, awful disease that is nearly always fatal if untreated; thus why this experimental protocol was devised.

The theory (as I understand it) behind the protocol is that since Rabies super-excites certain receptors in neurons in the brain (NMDA receptors) to cause peripheral nervous system hyperactivity and death, if you were to induce a coma by blocking NMDA receptors with something like ketamine, you could prevent the autonomic dysfunction that usually leads to death and buy the patient enough time to mount an immune response against the disease. The coma also allows doctors to manage other effects of Rabies (vasospasm, sodium depletion, dehydration, etc.) carefully and continuously since the disease progression is slowed, and administer drugs to get the immune system going and/or antiviral meds.

Success still isn't terribly high (8% from a quick glance), but I guess that's better than the near-100% fatality rate expected without treatment at all.

I can't find anyone using it to treat Lyme; if you can send a link to something about that, I will try to decipher why on earth this might work for that disease...but it doesn't seem to make a ton of sense outside of Rabies.  
























 Apparently there are 13 different proteins in the peanut that contain amino acid sequences to which antibodies attach ("epitopes"). People with peanut allergies usually have a specific immunoglobulin (IgE) that recognizes these epitopes from peanut proteins, and generates a massive immune/inflammatory response...hence, the severe anaphylaxis caused by peanuts in people with a peanut allergy.

It appears there is still some debate as to the major culprit, but you can read more about this topic [here](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijfs/2013/909140/). This paper gives a nice (but technical) overview of the different allergens thought to be responsible for peanut allergies. 




 [PubMed Central](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) is a good place to go. All the papers here are free to everyone. They're not the newest, but usually within the last 18 months. All of us government-funded researchers are now required to deposit our manuscripts there for "public consumption" after the original publication. 




 Agreed about administration; it's getting absurd the amount of 6-figure salaries being paid to people who tell us to do the exact same thing 5 different ways.

However, as a research scientist, I see very little incentive from the University to teach undergraduates. My grants bring in far more indirect dollars than my students, so most of my time is spent trying to get grants instead. Sometimes it feels like teaching responsibilities are used as punishments for scientists who've fallen on hard times (funding-wise). I think the united state's universities would be well-served to reward and encourage their brightest and best faculty to teach.

Also? No one has EVER taught US how to teach! Education classes should become compulsory during PhD-level graduate education...but perhaps this is a topic for a different discussion... 




 Two reasons: 

* the absorption rate/location of the drug
* the metabolism rate/location of the drug.

-
I'll use caffeine as the example, per your request. Caffeine is absorbed into the blood stream from your mouth, throat, stomach, and intestines. This absorption happens rapidly as you drink a cup of coffee for example, since caffeine is both water- and lipid-soluble. So, it gets into the blood stream pretty quickly and pretty freely. 

Furthermore, The enzymes that metabolize many drugs (caffeine included) are expressed in the highest amounts in the liver, not the digestive tract. Caffeine is thus not "broken down" until after it reaches the liver through the blood stream. In the liver, caffeine is then metabolized at a much slower rate, leading to a half-life of around 5 hours.

-
TL;DR: The body doesn't break down caffeine during digestion because it can't. 
























 Too many variables at play to be anything other than coincidence, in my opinion...but i also imagine that the rate of conjoined births is so low, and the factors you are asking about are so subjective, that there is no way to tell for certain. 




 Anecdotally, that's the mantra, right? Or "Beer before liquor, never sicker"? 
 
Usual causes of hangovers are dehydration, low blood sugar and stomach irritation. I think we can split hairs over the presence of congeners or other "impurities" in gin vs. vodka vs. brown liquor vs. wine vs. beer, but -- by and large -- the key is HOW MUCH you drink...not WHAT. 

That is to say, if mixing it up means you drink more high-alcohol content drinks in the same time period, then yes -- you'd probably have a worse headache than if you just stuck to beer. For the most part, though, that's due to the fact that you drank a bunch more alcohol -- not due to the fact you mixed up the types. 




 Judging by the concentration-response curves I could find with a cursory PubMed search, I would say diphenhydramine is a competitive antagonist at the H1 histamine receptor. It causes a parallel rightward shift in the curve, which is pretty typical of the pharmacodynamics of competitive antagonists. Thus, it seems to interact with the receptor in a similar way to histamine.

That being said, I did find other information that suggests diphenhydramine is actually an inverse agonist: that is to say, it blocks constitutive activity of the H1 receptor (activity present in even in the absence of histamine). So, I imagine that the description as a competitive inverse agonist may be apt here. Or, some allosteric modulation is also happening -- but that is PURE speculation on my part. 




 My best guess without doing a lot of digging is the relative metabolic demand of the tissues as compared with the blood volume. There is less blood to be pumped (and a much smaller heart to do it), and that creates the issue. For some small animals, a pretty high metabolic demand is present for many tissues. Same reason your heart rate goes up during exercise: think of a chipmunk, bouncing around all the time -- it takes a lot of energy to do that, and thus a high heart rate. 

Thus, I imagine the high HR is related to high metabolic demand of the animal's organs and tissues, and the small volume of blood present to carry nutrients to meet that demand...even when docile. 
























 All mice, as with humans, are susceptible to cancer to some extent....and I guess some research suggests mice are generally more "susceptible" than humans to some types of tumors. The cool thing with the mice is that you can use targeted genetic mutations to make the mice far more susceptible to certain types of cancers, and then look at the effect of stimuli on that rate of tumor development. That's what the researchers did here: they took a strain of mouse known to develop a certain (mammary, in this case) type of tumor, and had a control group and a group exposed to a disruption of day/night cycle. Then they compared the two.
Whether or not the mice develop tumors faster/more often than humans isn't so important...at least, not to this study. That's the beauty of the mouse studies -- taking genetically-identical mice and subjecting them to different conditions. I know it might not ultimately apply to humans, but it's a start.  




 That's an interesting premise I'd not considered...would the high HR and the resultant increase in blood flow be to defend against the rapid heat loss, or a result of compensation for the more rapid heat loss? 




 Some yes, some no. In this case the venom breaks up clots, not causes clots. The title is wrong. 




 They seem to make the implication that this new anti-thrombotic has a reduced risk of bleeding -- without testing that at all. If you can't clot, you're going to bleed...right? So that danger is still present. 

To me, the novelty here is the ability to produce heterodimeric proteins in yeast in a balanced way; this opens up a LOT of novel methodologies for investigating new therapeutic agents that act as heterodimers instead of monomers or homodimers...and also as a screening tool to find small molecules that can interfere with heterodimerization in a now-measurable (and better controlled) way.  I find THAT part of the study extremely interesting and promising.  
























 In short, TLR4 receptors are part of the inflammatory signaling pathways that respond to things like bacterial infections. While some evidence existed that these receptors could affect insulin sensitivity, there was much debate as to the nature of this effect since it was only described in genetic knockout animals. These researchers used pharmacological tools to conclude that TLR4 block in vivo restored insulin sensitivity in both the periphery and the liver directly, and not because of influencing weight gain and fat deposition (as suggested in other studies). Does this make TLR4 a novel target for type 2 diabetes? Perhaps...but the well-documented role for TLR4 in immune responses leave me dubious. Nonetheless, and interesting read -- for those interested in receptor pharmacology!

EDIT: Typo. 




 In other words: I don't think it's been documented, nor do I think it's possible for anyone to "have a clue". 




 You need any help on it, I'd be glad to be involved. 




 You're welcome!! 




 TOTALLY agree. And the title is actually COMPLETELY wrong: they made an anti-clotting agent. 




 Yes, it is...But the venom wasn't used in the experiments per se. They genetically altered the yeast to make the same protein as was found in the venom. And this is pretty cheap, by comparison. 




 Whew. Umm. Okay. To stick with the ELI5 idea:

During normal metabolism and cellular function, free radicals ("reactive oxygen species") are produced. These are highly-reactive oxygen-containing compounds with an extra electron that *really* wants to get rid of; in this instance, we're talking about superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. They can react with all sorts of proteins and stuff, causing cellular dysfunction and damage.

But, since they form through natural metabolism, the body has also developed defenses against them. Certain enzymes and vitamins (peroxidases and vitamin E, for example) help get rid of these things by reducing (as opposed to oxidizing) the reactive oxygen species and preventing them from doing damage.

However, many diseases and stimuli (diabetes, obesity, inflammation) can increase the production of reactive oxygen species. This is bad news when it overwhelms our natural ability to get rid of the reactive oxygen species. The result: "oxidative stress". Oxidative stress is a catch-all term to define a state where the production of these free radicals exceeds their removal, leading to cellular damage and ultimately dysfunction. 




 I think you mean plaque, not plague. But the problem (as stated in the article) is not just breaking up the plaques -- it's doing it in a timeframe that is soon enough to prevent the irreversible cognitive decline. Breaking up the plaques is super; subsequently restoring function would be the Holy Grail.

Still, as we're able to identify the plaques earlier and earlier, this new drug has HUGE promise at preventing cognitive decline. 




 I can try. Feeding mice a high fat diet resulted in oxidative stress, increased inflammation, and caused fat to be deposited in the liver and other organs where it doesn't belong. The researchers contest that a change in the connective tissue between the fat cells (adipocytes), due to oxidative stress, prevented them from expanding to store the circulating fatty acids that were damaging other organs and causes all the trouble.

By giving the mice a lot of vitamin E (an antioxidant), they were able to combat the oxidative stress, prevent the remodeling of the fat cells, and basically improve the health of the obese mice.
 




 Ha. I'll bite....and start with something basic. I'm going to suggest the battery: that amount of electrical energy stored in such a small "container" would be of HUGE interest to things like space exploration and medicine.
