 Im not a fan of the "waves of zombies from generator being on" but i can see it attracting ones that are already nearby due to noise.
Edit: i would also like to add I love the idea of the higher number of people required for progression. A person will always be able to find a group. 




 Lolwut  




 Okay i see your point. The only problem for me is if i miss that first shot, im toast. 




 Often in a group ill choose the sks, because normally someone else has long range, but what would you pick if you were alone? 




 My goal of this  post is to always have a definitive choice when it comes to these guns. So could you please tell me why the mosin over the sks. 




 A lot of times thats what i think, but the fact that the mosin is always a one hit kill makes me torn between the two. 




 Its most likely that same part, but for the Remington 870
 




 Epoch. Best version of dayz out there. 




 I get that, and there are quite the number
Of troll fresh spawns. I wish there was a way to make this work regardless. 




 Alright, i see where you're coming from. Im just very tired of spawning in, walking for a minute and a half just to get offed by a guy with a mosin on some roof 




 Just no? No constructive criticism?  
























  This time, the doors are standing wide open.


Edit: doors not soors
 




 Well my hope was that since its in the second person, you make that choice. What would YOU do in that situation. 




 Damnit Abigail. Get your shit together!
 




 makes sense. western jets are indeed, the coolest shit to ever have. ever. 




 I hate to tell you, but i've read a nosleep with the EXACT same plot, but I believe there was only one clone of the original... 




 Yeah, OP, i get you want this and i think its nice, but the truth is, they cant (and wont, i dont blame them) change a whole system that is already made, just to make crafting a bit more challenging.

Also, in some ways i dont like your idea. If you think to dayz epoch, it is very hard to build there. That has its problems, as it creates an extreme gap between the group of 10 guys with a cinder fortress and the noobs in the tent that get gunned down every five minutes.
 




 Even in dayz, kos city, i make it my goal to not have to put anyone down. Dont get me wrong, i die a lot, but i plan to be the friendliest guy you will meet. 




 Yeah the garand is the one im praying for.

 I would personally rather see more practical weapons. The xm2010 is rare as hell as is, and same for the m82. Desert eagles i guess, but they shouldn't be abundant. As for the tar and famas. The famas is an exotic weapon and should be rare. And the tar would probably be the civilian version (iwi tavor) and not have to be ultra rare 




 Alright so nearly every gun on earth... Don't forget, this is America. 


"America, where you can buy a gun for cheaper than a month's rent" 
























 No matter what country you come from, we can mostly all agree. EARTH, FUCK YEA! 




 people are applauding THIS pope, because he is the first one courageous enough to change those thoughts, which isn't that easy of a thing to do. 




 Bushmaster XM15, i got a magpul handguard, pistol grip, rear sight, and buttstock for it. Paid around 900$ for everything after mags and background check and all. 









 Oh shit they are the zombies!!! Its just worded very very well! 




 everyone! 




 didn't see that coming! 




 Are they cannibals? Or looking to steal food? Either way i like it! 




 I really like this story, probably one of the best 'zombie' stories ive read in a while 




 Thanks! 




 10/10 would crossbow again 
























 "By early Monday, the Internet went as dark as one of those satellite photographs showing the impoverished country by night." 

Apply
Cold water to burn area. 




 I found two in a single boat just yesterday. 




 I can't express how much i love the 'police report' story 




 Really a great story! 




 *apologizes for not standing up for himself* 




 I would be really interested if you maybe made a bunch of these police recordings, maybe with different events and stuff. 




 I just got a chill. The chances that this is a real story hit me at the end... 




 I used to play fortunate son back in arma 2 domination 




 Confusin what is real!! 




 Nice rifle! 




 Thank you for making me feel welcome! 
























 Confirmed by the devs that lie to us about it in the first place... Not sure how i feel about this whole thing. 




 I mean shit if he had a chart, hes right... 




 Ask em to send it to you now, so it can be done by mid april! /s 




 We don't



*Airhorns blaze as Kruschev gets 360 noscoped.* 




 Theres a first time for everything i guess. 




 I for one love the crown victoria police car, for some reason i love that car and the way it looks in a police color scheme. If they were to add something for me it would be a Suburban SUV, and a Suburban police variant. If it holds eight people that will make my month 




 Curiosity is on around 800 days out of 650, so It's beaten the test as well, and It's still brand new! 




 I was actually contmplating watching that about five minutes ago! Glad I'm far too picky on netflix. 




 I don't see any reason both couldn't be sufficient. One for the dog one for the PC kinda thing. 




 Nvidia GTX 660 is mine, id like to win this for a friend with a laptop for a PC, so he can start a build. Gaben gave me steam sales, which took all of my money. Am starve. Still worth it though. 




 I imagined him with a Texas accent. 
























 I didnt expect to laugh out loud so badly while on the toilet today. 




 Holy shit dude, thats metal. 




 Yeah sub-hunter helicpters or boats with depth charges as a counter. Do they still use depth charges? 




 /r/theydidthemath 




 Oh damn i didnt even see that! Either way boonie hats make you like 6 times cooler in my opinion. 




 DayZ  




 I just wish I could've found a black armband rather than yellow. 









 /r/thalassophobia is what you are looking for. It's a subreddit dedicated to your fears. Don't feel bad I have it too... 




 I have it. Yesterday i was in the deep water, and I *dropped* my paddle in the water. I watched it sink, and was too scared to try and get it. I was out and stranded... The deep areas do a real good job of giving me anxiety attacks. Ive had two half panic attacks when a shark came out of *nowhere* and I just could not climb back into the raft. 




 764 
























 It was more of a joke than anything, It's completely harmless. I just found it funny that the same tiny bug has been in the game for ages. 




 that little muzzle break glitch :P 
it isn't a major deal, but it'd be nice lol 









 I'm impressed you didn't fall over dead from one of the many random things that can kill you! 




 I know this trick/tactic, yet sometimes i get too excited to wait. Last winter sale banished went up for 50% off, so i bought a copy for a buddy and me, 20$. Then two days later it goes up for 75% off and i felt this strange *robbed but not robbed* emotion inside of me.  




 Here is what I noticed, so the map is about 64km^2, and there are 1500 zombies possible. So that means for every 1km area, there is ~23 zombies (1500/64). If you divide 23 by 10(10x100m=1km), that means there are ~2.3 zombies per 100m area. Therefore if you subtract 2 from 2.3, you get .3 of a zombie, which confirms BI is adding crawlers. :D





All kidding aside, if there is a possibility of 2 zombies per 100m area, and you move them to denser/more urban area rather than random nondescript woods, It's a pretty decent size in towns. 




 A good tip is to open your inventory, and then hit the desired key, works the first time everytime. 




 Playing on servers with at least 15 people. Found the AUG's in a 30+ population server, please tell me more about how I'm on low pops. 




 *mobile loot* took me a while. 




 It's like only a few months into the apocalypse. Pretty sure the stuff would look normal. 




 Heres my problem. I am ultra friendly and will ALWAYS give someone the benefit of the doubt. However my group, not so much. So when we meet someone, It's 4 of my buddies wanting to kill the guy we met, and me being the voice of reason. Normally I win because I tell my friends I WILL shoot them if they shoot somebody in cold blood. But for the most part my group is friendly, mostly due to me carrying the peace.
In any survival game, I try to be as friendly as possible. Hell, I met friendly people in that PvP fest WarZ, while I had full gear and the other people didn't.  
























 Well 3000 is quite a large sum, but that doesn't make $800 nothing! $800 is like a whole new PC!  




 Maybe i haven't been here long enough, because this hit me out of nowhere. 




 *passive aggressive content creator* 




 I'm glad someone thought that idea was good! I really think it'd be neat for higher pop servers, 




 Aww, this made me really excited for a second. 




 Yeah, you can almost instantly tell shady people from not shady people. Pne time a friend and I are at NWAF with AUG's and full gear, roaming. We go into a barrack and meet two people. We had our guns drawn and so did they. Something in their voice told me they were honest people. About five minutes later in the NWAF firestation, two other people show up shouting "friendly, friendly" and walked up to us. Something in their words or movements told me something was up, and i said "we have to go, sorry!" and we ran off. If you get a bad feeling, trust your instincts. 




 I hope rule 3 is something about not making posts about getting hacked, because that is literally half of posts here right now. 




 How on earth did they manage that? Thats awesome! 




 THANK YOU! I love this game to death, but it ends up being really hard to tell my friends that the zombies still glitch through walls, and thats why they died, two and a half YEARS after it was released. At this point most of my friends will give up playing, join me in a few months, die walking up stairs or something like that, and give up again. Some really basic stuff needs to be sorted out. 




 Have a Camelbak (or water bladder) that attaches to your military backpack (or vest) without taking up any space (much like a holster). It holds 2 liters and can be used while moving, rather than stopping.

Also the Coyote pack from Arma 2, that spawns at nato heli crashes with an area of 30 (6x5).


Also, spawning in fresh with a battery, flashlight, AND a walkie-talkie, to bring back side chat in a way, would be pretty neat.

EDIT: Camelbak not Camelpak 




 My only concern is that these new infected are going to be as buggy as the old ones (which is what it seems so far), but far faster and in higher numbers. If the new AI is released with a high number of bugs it could ruin the game, for me at least. 
























 Ok i read the Desolate Guardians and I'm a bit better about understanding now 




 *except they cost more*


The marines arent a branch known to want to spend a lot on their equipment. 




 Kittyhawk. Don't ask why because I don't know either. 




 Mind you the Huey they are using is modern and up to date with standards... 









 I read the portal in the forest, but for some reason these things arent connecting for me. 




 Ill be honest, after reading part one and two i can safely say, I am incredibly intrigued and incredibly confused as to what the fuck is happening. 




 It's funny how even with all of the photography effects you can tell they aren't from the 1800's because they aren't malnourished. 




 *grumble grumble america grumble grumble* 




 I couldn't relate to this more. And with wargame's super-zoom technology and good vehicle models It is impossible for me to avoid. 




 Japan owns us!  





























 I have that same keyboard, and I hate it... 




 Oh fuck. I really hate you for this theory... Now I'm sad. 




 It's hard to stress that this is not a normal occurance. I live in Nevada, a pretty leniant state, I also own an AR, but I would NEVER in my life go and waltz into the nearest Wal-Mart with it, because I don't enjoy scaring people. Also, I've never seen anyone carrying more than a handgun because its just stupid. 




 [Question]: Is it possible to turn off transactions for steam? I've noticed just now that any game, dlc, etc, does not display a price any more and cannot be seen. I assume a friend of mine did this as a joke but they wont fess up to it, could anyone help me possibly undo this?

[Platform]: PC

Turns out this may be a bug with steam currently, as I looked through this subreddit and some people very recently are having the exact same issue. So it isn't just me. 




 That is insane. Glad our nukes were safely secured! 









 I don't know a lot about the rules, but couldn't you have what you do now, with the video embedded where the picture of the thumbnail is now? 




 Its 4 am, I didnt check what I opened, and i just jumped about ten fucking feet back. Fuck you OP! 




 I thought seeing that movie was one of the security questions to sign up?!? 




 That took me a second hahahaha 




 I've heard Del-Ton was a pretty reliable compay, and was considering buying from them. Do you think this is an isolated case, or a problem they almost always see? 




 Sorry for being that guy. 

They're

FTFY 




 Aw man, this story was fantastic. Really great job on this one! 




 Holy crap, that soon!?!? just made my week! 




 Are you willing to give us any actual timeframe on the release of the next case file? If not I understand, no pressure! 




 Fuck you OP. You can just stop right there and never write a goddamn word about these ants again. I was just peacefully sitting on my couch reading, but no, now I'm searching my house for any evidence of ants.

For the record this is even creepier to me as only a few months ago i woke up in the middle of the night to a large group of ants crawling on me, my clothes, and my bed. 




 I always put canadian roundels over my british roundels, it isnt noticeable if you do it right (most of the time)

I'm also not canadian I don't know why I do this. 




 Well good job on your finals. I'm dreading mine 




 As a NATO player finally branching out from just playing USA/NORAD, what coalition would you guys suggest? So far i'm leaning towards either Eurocorps or Scandinavia. I played Airborne as the US, but I feel like i've played enough to manage any deck type.

Also, I generally play with a friend that uses a Commonwealth Mechanized deck, so If my coalition/deck type could help seamlessly work with his that'd be great!

Note: I'm not asking anyone to make me a deck, I would just like some advice on what coalition + type to select.
