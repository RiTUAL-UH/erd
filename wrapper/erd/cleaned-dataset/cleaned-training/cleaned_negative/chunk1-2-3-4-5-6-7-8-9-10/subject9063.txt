 I took him to mean it in that way as well. I see more Akalis carrying than Zeds at the moment though, but that's silver elo. Where I see Akali having an easier play style than Zed (but still damn hard to master) with less fancy mechanics to mess up due to the poor mechanical play from the lower masses. 




 I don't think WE is useless at the stage in its parts WW works very well with AS and recurve bow and dagger give a lot of AS making his early clears much quicker. At least I always make those two first unless I plan on ganking mid more. 




 If can vouch for that! Had a game last night went WE first then finished FF went Tabi and SV and RO then BOTRK. Ended a 48 minute game with 10/0/20 the enemy team was ahead for a large amount of the game. Safe to say they flamed me quite hard in post game lobby. I would 100-0 their carries every TF.
(Edit for grammar) 




 A lot of people say to go WE if you are behind when you start ganking and BOTRK if you are ahead. Personally I always start WE then finish FF I usually have enough gold by the time I stack it up to have both. Two tank items depending on team comp and who's fed. Then BOTRK but alas I am a lowly silver player so I'm probably doing it all wrong! 

I do agree BOTRK is a stronger item but is a lot more expensive and by hitting the power spike of FF and WE by the 17 minute mark or so I think it helps out a lot more for the early to mid game. 

Correct me anyone if you think I'm wrong would like to know if what I'm doing is correct. 




 Ah ok. I didn't watch the vid because I'm in work just presumed it was for junglers!
 




 I will have to try this, I've lately had great success jungling with ww at silver elo and never once thought that perhaps I should invade solo. High risk high reward I suppose! Although as ww I do always pink my red before going blue at the start anyway so I never get solo countered only by 5 man groups which has happened a fair few times!  




 I main ww and I use the exact same path and always hit 6 at around the 7 minute mark. I've tried the other routes but find the one you use the most efficient due to his sustain and lack of need to clear both buffs quickly. The only time I will deviate is if I fear being invaded at either buffs.

Also another quick note if you don't already do this is to start with a pink and save your 50 remaining gold for your first back don't waste it on a hp pot at the start its really not needed on ww. 
























 *Ensure ..... I highly doubt he's going back in time to buy insurance. That's just way to convoluted for any time travel paradox.
Edit: Although it could make him rich with the payouts..... 




 His probablity logic is not off. They have a higher chance of having a smurf on their team because there is 5 people that you don't know if they are or not but only 4 on your team. So smurf chances are stacked in their favour unless as he suggested you are a smurf yourself. Of course that doesn't diminish the odds of the four on your team of course, but still higher chance on theirs. 




 I don't think mmo's which are a different type of game in all honesty but still a game with major updates, content and balancing still don't require you to be a certain pvp rank or have completed so much content to be a QA tester. So why should it be different for riot? 




 Quality assurance tester. 




 I don't think that Is the point the op is trying to get across. I completely agree hiring people based on their skill of the game is just silly, if it is true of course. That aside I have never heard of this from any game before other than their usually being a stipulation of a love for the game in question.
Edit: For spelling. 




 I'm sure that isn't supposed to be possible, in ranked at least, in normals I'm not sure. 




 I am not entirely sure because I don't use target champs only. But I would imagine Riot had intended to not use both at the same time because that would make poking through the wave incredibly easy and thus would have set attack move to override target champ only. As I said not entirely sure but it makes sense to me. 
























 Looks like dad might have lost something you're not aware of. His bandaging skills are bad ass. He's done this before clearly.... 
Edit: pressed save too early and missed something out. 




 Obvious mistake, is obvious.... 




 Yeah blame the chain for not helping its disabled employee's more tbh. Totally their fault clearly haha. But again a 60 year old deaf lady who doesn't even attempt to lip read is kinda silly. And yes I'm aware that we should make changes for them and not the other way around but its the simple things that are taught to deaf children all around the world to help them overcome these things. So yeah she did it on purpose imo. 




 Not sure on this but I think like 99% of deaf people learn to lip read pretty damn well. Sounds like she was trolling you. Unless she was looking away from you through the entire situation which you said she wasn't. To be honest a badge reading I'm deaf does not prepare you for how to deal with the situation and that persons employers should be taking more steps to avoid this kind of thing. Totally not your fault. Although a little less laughing could have been avoided perhaps..... p.s. I'm from wales too woop. 




 I think you know why you got banned. You stated your self that you had been chat restricted more than once. Perhaps you should have changed your ways? No sympathy. 




 Lol no witch hunting and you post his stream. Think that's kinda the same thing, but hey helps us see who it is! This is all over reddit at the mo as well nothing new :( exploits galore lately...  




 I wouldn't say those stats are fantastic but the winrate is suggesting to me you got lucky. 
























 That is hilarious dude. I've seen that movie twas pretty bad, but if she's who I think she is she wasn't so bad. Glad you got away with it all. What did they expect from you!  




 Yes this. Without a doubt with the new online harassment laws in place you can certainly tear her a new one with very little effort. 




 If you didn't know who Nicole Aniston was why did you say it? I smell a vintage porn perv! 




 After re-reading I see you didn't drink it till you got there. Fair enough then :) still an alcoholic though! 




 Tl;dr socially inept alcoholic drinks and drives, and doesn't kill anyone ..... kudos. 




 Lol clearly. But at least you retorted with a comprehensible answer excluding you from being an idiot at least :D 




 Ah makes perfect sense then cause that shit was nigh on perfect! 
























 This is a standard during lots of matchups for wukong. Pretty much anyone with high poke or sustain and you're not too clued up on the matchup you Should start flask and pots. 




 I don't see why this post is dumb at all! A lot of people do make this mistake though and every time I dread to think what it would be like I their shoes.... 




 Probably best to distance yourself for her own good imo. But no harm in being friends with her if you think you can. 




 Definitely not a good idea dude..... feel for you bro. 




 Reminds me of the time when I was a child and called my friend a dildo I was about 7 at the time. I said it because it reminded me of armadillo. Till my step dad heard me and told me to go ask my mother what a dildo was ...... 




 Seriously? That tax system is insane. And here we are in the UK with our 10,000 tax free allowance and we still complain..... 




 Hos before bros dude. Tap it and forget it. 
























 As a qualified electrician and lighting technician for film and television working on the likes of Dr. Who and such. I have to remind you that not all MCB's have the same breaking capacity and its' not just the MCB that dictates what can be run on a single circuit but the gauge and the type of the wiring used. Yes what you have said is typical of a standard 1mm lighting circuit but not a standard ring main used for power or anything else for that matter. 




 I think I can simplify a lot of these answers. A wise friend once told me when I questioned him on his feelings of death and what he felt about dying. He simply said "Can you remember before being born and do you ever care about that? Death can be seen as the same" Made me feel better at the time and truth be told, surprisingly, I don't worry so much as before just hearing that one sentence.  




 We all learn the hard way how to court the females of the species. Sound's to me like this girl was up herself somewhat. But I digress, feel for you man. 




 Been married 2 years but thanks anyway :D 




 No doesn't make sense she wouldn't be my wife. When I clearly pointed out that she said I do fit. Try being funny elsewhere. 




 Doesn't make sense, but ok :) 




 I've heard many a woman say they had a penis that didn't fit. Including my wife, shame she wasn't talking about me at the time..... 
























 No the current standard in any modernised country are MCB's which are Miniature Circuit Breakers for domestic installations. No idea why you would think otherwise for the UK. 




 Most old installations have what we call rewireable fuses that have a significantly higher trip time and ampage capacity. So therefore a large amount of current can be flowing for a lot longer before the blow. They don't exactly blow but the wire just melts and this is why we don't use them any more. The new standards in the current 17th edition wiring regs clearly state that those kind of fuses can no longer be used in rewires or new builds. Edit: this post was to indicate I wasn't talking about Cartridge fuses which are of course still legal but never used in a domestic distro board. 




 The uk has one of the highest Standards of electrical safety in the world. As below says I'll take my electric with a double safety standard any day. No earth to protect your appliances and yourself is the crazy thing. If you want a horror story try looking over at /r/electricians some of the stuff people post from the third world countries are scary as shit. 




 I will never understand why in new iterations of electrical practices they use U for voltage in equations it was explained to me why but still doesn't make much sense.... what was wrong with V! 




 Thanks for your reply mate. Yeah I understand these problems are a crux for local electrcians to deal with. Specially with how the housing market is at the moment. I have offered my services for free as well as well under a labourers daily fee and still no luck. My situation is kind of unique as well I'm not qualifying to become an electrician so to speak but to be qualified to do set lighting for the film industry which requires you to be a qualified spark. Just kind of frustrating is all!  




 Hi guys I'm new to this subreddit so just wanted some basic info and to introduce myself. I live in Wales in the UK and I'm currently studying towards fully qualifying, I am part qualified already to the C G level 2. Soon I will have finished level 3 and will be working towards my NVQ. My biggest question is, are there any Welsh electricians using this sub that could help me in the long run? All my very local companies are highly unhelpful and I'm at wits end trying to get practical experience.  So any tips or leads would be extremely helpful! Thanks in advance guys :) oh and as an edit I would like to add that I live in south wales! 




 I think you'll find that a lot of homes around the world including america but specially here in the uk still have rewirable fuses on their distribution boards. They are still legal but nowhere near as safe for blowing out in risky high amp situations. And also not legal to put in to new houses or when doing a rewire on an old house.  
























 I did search this reddit to find out if this had been said before but couldn't find anything, so please take my apologies if its old news.

I have personally met with all the cast members this year, autograph hunting, and have asked each one individually and they all confirmed that series 11 is set for an end of 2015 release.

Hope thats good news for all of you! 









 Yeah in the uk its been all over the papers about underage teens sending snapchat nudes to eachother and people taking screen shots and showing them around school. Both boys and girls have been arrested for distributing child porn. Well done government. 




 That's pretty cruel. Could at least big him up on the net, poor boy! 




 Charity begins at home, didn't your parents tell you this! 




 Yeah I will definitely look into it in the new year :) 




 I have no idea what that is to be totally honest with you, quick google and now I do know, that really does sound like a good idea, thanks for the info! 
























 Just a short video of a tornado in Port Talbot - Wales, Nothing spectacular but the only video of a tornado in this area i've ever seen. No amount of web searching came up with anything else! 









 When I saw him he was very jittery and seemed very stressed out and was on the phone to his publicist talking about a flight from Manchester airport the next day, wasn't till later on the next week I found out he was going to the jungle and why he seemed so worried haha. 









 Well thats the thing, i spoke to Danny in March and he denied anything, spoke to Robert in May he confirmed, spoke to Norman and Chris in October they both confirmed and finally spoke to Craig in November and he also confirmed. But when i spoke to Robert and queried why Danny said no, he stated that back then they weren't allowed to confirm but since then they have all been told they can say it's happening.

Spoke to all of them in one year, was pretty proud of that! 




 no probs velixie, love it 




 Last time i spoke to one was Craig Charles in Cardiff at the start of November and he confirmed for end of 2015 then. 





























 awesome film! 




 Would you wash your hands after you're done though? That's the real man question. 




 Cute, very cute. But it's a Mac. Better teach her to play on a real machine. She seems pretty disssssapointed in your choice. 









 Well its something you would do really isn't it! Silly girl and her silliness. 




 And she's better than me at poker...... 




 Can confirm OP is a girl, she's my wife..... 




 This is very helpful, it's not actually for me but my wife so I will get her to read all your helpful posts and see what she thinks of them! Perhaps soon I will post some of her first work! 

Again thanks a lot guys never before has a sub been this helpful to me! 




 Woman, you're clumsy.    




 Hi there, I'm interested in starting up animation as a small hobby, I was just curious as to what programs would be useful in starting myself off? I'm looking for any program that might have lots of pre-set templates that would be able to help me in studying the basic concepts of animation with an easy pre-cursor to more advanced things.

Sorry if this sounds like a silly request, have no real background on animation programs, the only thing I've really done in the past is stop motion.  









 Was wondering where In this post someone would mention the blatant mis leading title about being left at the altar. Original news post on reddit suggests it was a week before. Not at the altar as this post says. 




 It was only a phone camera, get off my case :( lol 




 Yeah this video didn't capture it very well but local reports from people suggested it did touch down ever so slightly out of sight from where i was.
