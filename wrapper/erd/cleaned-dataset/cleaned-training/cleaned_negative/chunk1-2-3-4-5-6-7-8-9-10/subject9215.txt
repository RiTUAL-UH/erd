 when you have a lot of apps opened do you feel any slowdown when switching spaces, minimizing windows ? 




 have you updated or restored to 8.4 ? 




 I wasn't trying to argue either, just sharing my point of view ;) you've said it all, nothing else to add 




 Everything we know about life it's based on our planet. To think beyond earth it's quite a challenge 




 we don't know, I believe, how big the universe truly is, so, we will never know for sure 




 jailbreak 8.4 instead .. it's all working, and tweaks will be released and updated to 8.4 not 8.3. Plus, you'll get the new music app which, if you don't give a damn about Apple Music, is rubbish
 




 have you refreshed the sources ? 




 mentalism here ahah 




 indeed, but they always have something to complain about. The jailbreak: "Oh, that's complicated to do, it's not always available, warranty, and so on". I love my iPhone jailbroken, i don't like the stock, it  have too many things to improve 




 I did not .. you're right my bad 




 electronics ? Wo why do pilots use iPads ? 




 it's sad that rain doesn't come in colors 




 it could be estimated. there's nobody in space counting, I guess 




 Exactly ! the problem is Apple don't give a damn about who don't use Apple Music 




 if he's running 8.4 and they work I guess they're compatible don't you think ? 




 that's the question for $1M 




 that's why the iPod is dead ahah 




 people that say android is more customizable than iOS must must watch this ! 




 ahah it might. 




 So, do you believe in Bin Laden's death ? 




 he was not an idiot after all ahah 




 yes, I know, but what I mean is there's a reason. 




 you will never get the full 16GB.. you might get 10 




 MxNitro hasn't come to OS X yet ! 




 if they are about the same price you have to decide whether the bigger screen/more power is better for you. 




 why the current year is 2015 and not some billion ? 




 yeah, but the world is huge so that's the way it is I guess ...
 




 40 devices ? Wow 




 notifications for a specific app you mean app badges ?  




 I know :) but the 2.5 and 2.8 he's refering are quad core i7 available in the 15'' rMBP 




 I used TaiG 2.2 but since there are newer versions you can try it. If it gets stuck you'll have to restore. 




 it doesn't get stuck. I updated my iPhone to 8.4 from 8.3 and it got stuck at 60%(injecting). I restored and dis it again and it worked flawlessly 




 yes, and it's true. But it seems that TaiG works better with restored systems. If you restore from backup after jailbreaking you just need to download the tweaks and their settings are all set 




 do you feel it drains faster ? 




 I updated from 8.3 to 8.4. It was stuck at 60%. I restored to 8.4 and it worked fine 




 7.0 ? Oh lord ! It's better to restore. I had issues jailbreaking 8.4 as I updated from 8.3. I restored
 and had no issues 




 Alkaline ? Why ? 




 the real difference is Apple Music, or the music app.. 




 people don't want to install packages manually. I jailbroke an iPad yesterday using TaiG 2.2 and updated cydia, substrate and the TaiG package through cydia 




 you don't feel safe without an antivirus ? 




 it's not terrible, it might be for your needs. if you don't use external monitors, external storage, and you need a laptop everyday it's a good machine. Of course you'll have to pay for it and that's the hard part I guess 




 what rMBP ? 




 the 2.5 and 2.8 are both i7 




 great video, hope Apple watches it 




 My question is, why having all of those buttons ... if you don't use Apple Music you only need My music.. and searching between albums and songs it's way different now  




 I think it's nice to have a new music app but this is entirely focused on Apple Music. They don't want a separated app so this is what we got  




 update now, no issues so far 




 I think it's safe but you have to double check what you are trying to install 




 It's the first time i see someone amazed with iTunes 




 I did a respring and it's working fine 
























 have you restored or updated to 8.4 ? 




 let's hope it won't be necessary 




 and what if they get out of control ?  




 No issues here, have you restored or updated to 8.4? 




 Just bring the old app back ! 




 Sure, I'm sitting watching tv and I'm sweating just like I was running  




 The problem is virus and bacteria will get stronger and will resist our medicines 




 Have in mind the Air have a slightly bigger footprint 
 




 if the size and weight aren't a worry get the retina, your eyes will thank me 




 you'll be probably disappointed in less than a year with the 4s .. the 5s is the sweet spot. if it's too much get the 5. you could get good deals on it 




 it's really to force people to use Apple Music 




 The thing is there's 5 button on the bottom but I only use one ! The paylist, albums are all mixed up 




 yes sure, if the're certified they're fine. There are even gold cables now ! 




 don't use 3rd party cables/chargers  




 that'd be heaven .. For those who don't use Apple Music the new music app is rubbish .. great album artwork though 




 there are people that have a carrer like that, but i imagine it's not that simple 




 you're not harming your device by jailbreaking .. all messages are saves via iTunes backup. wpa2 I'm not sure, i used an app but was back in iOS 6 I dont know if it's working in iOS 8 but it knew all default passwords for thomson, linksys, and many other brands 




 indeed ! I wouldn't imagine having a stock iPhone, it's really boring .. that's what android users say 




 CCSettings for sure ! the stock control center is rubbish, you can't put the toggles you actually need ! C'mon Apple  




 it might be harder but iOS 9 will be jailbroken. cross fingers 




 I don't believe in 4K video. They'll start with 16gb storage .. 
more ram maybe..
force touch please ! 




 dreamboard and bitesms for sure .. Reading all the comments feels like travelling back in time  




 if nothing works I guess your only alternative is to try again 




 did you updated or restored to 8.4 ?  




 8.4 for sure. You'll get the new music app, of course it's rubbish if you don't care about Apple Music but still os the latest version. I updated from 8.1 and I notice better battery 




 it's just $1.8 in India 




 * backup in iTunes
* you restore to 8.4
* jailbreak
* restore backup
* open cydia add repos
* install tweaks, themes, anything you want from cydia

all App Store apps will be added after you sync your device in iTunes 




 you just need to write down the repos. Restoring from backup will get your tweaks working, make sure they're compatible with 8.4 ! Add the repos to cydia and install tweaks, all settings will be set  




 it will bring back all the tweaks' settings, just need to reinstall them. 




 you can try but restoring is 100% sure it'd work 




 all jailbreaks I did with 8.4 being the only exception (I haven't tried) were made after OTA updates 




 Actually you can,  you'll have to edit a file inside the backup which says the version. 




 I guess they're worried about you lol 




 Google how to put the iPhone in recovery mode  




 I restored my iPad and it was "waiting for iPad" maybe 10 minutes and it continued and restored fine. you have to restore it 




 it's enabled by default. I was just asking. If you have it enabled it's weird 




 it can be disabled inside apps in the stock settings menu. Check if you have it activated 




 they seem shorter, but the global clocks have one more second to count I am right ? 




 how'd we find stuff on the web ? 




 Exactly  




 That's really a shower thought ahaha

 thanks ! The dedicated graphics it's not for everyone.. It's expensive but it's a great machine !! 




 it works just fine 




 Yes ! It's nice to have a jailbreak for the latest major release before iOS 9 




 just follow the steps and you'll be fine  




 i did a jailbreak using iTunes 12.2, the latest version and TaiG 2.2.0 today 




 that's the problem. I had the same issue. Backup your device and restore it. Then apply TaiG. Finnaly, restore from backup. Just need to add all repos to cydia. All tweaks' settings are saved in the iTunes backup 
























 yes, jailbreak with a restored OS 




 Actually, it's not that bad for general stuff. It's capable of handling mail, multiple safari tabs, pages, iTunes.  




 it might have happened, but since they were bacteria they didn't knew what was happening 




 Springtomize does the job ;) 




 I don't know either, it was an honest question. maybe because I'm talking about the accident .. 




 You got me. The 13-inch retina is well priced and there are other notebooks with inferior performance with higher prices. I'm looking for the 15'', it's the size I'm used to. I like the MacBook but it's only for general usage, I hate the screen on the air ...  




 I'm not saying they're not, I'm saying Apple could sell a lot more of them and it's hard to justify the price. I have an iPhone 6, sure it was expensive and I'm 100% satisfied, I know the Apple ecosystem 




 I updated and couldn't get past 60%, I think you should restore  




 It's impossible to master feminism  




 And if you don't bring a girl to your condom then ... Okay I've gone too far  




 Sure. His life was dedicated to the people, trying to teach them about the environment  




 Macs are expensive, we all know that. But in Europe they're crazy expensive and in February or March the prices increased 300 due to the U.S. Dollar. My thinking is that apple would sell a ton of MacBooks if they were 300-500 cheaper. The first thing I hear people talking about macs are how expensive they are. Then 15" for example starts at 2300. Sure with student discount it costs 2.100 but it's still ludicrous. If it was 1800 I'd be all over it. 




 yeah it is .. but when it's the only option .. gotta do it 




 how do you know he was then ? Have you ever asked him?  




 if it does a sound and no one hears it, does it count as a sound ? 




 he wasn't thinking about the environment :D  




 iPhone 6 here, WiFi way better in 8.4 than on 8.1. No issues so far 




 Try another USB port, worked for me

 Since they were already updated this year most people don't think we will see another refresh. However, I believe there's a chance we'll see a refresh probably in October in the iPad event. Thunderbolt 3, Skylake CPU

 Since his accident who was the STIG ? 




 There's a Panamera, don't look !  




 Where's Hammond?   




 Oh my bad then .. If the phone is only 2 weeks old you have to take it to an Apple Store  




 I also want to know, the stock reminders app takes ages to create a reminder with a specific time. I give checkmark2 a try and it was better but Im back at square one. 




 yes ! the best thing is I left it at night with 100% and Wi-Fi enabled. In the morning, it never has less than 97%, and I have a lot of notifications from several apps 




 haev you tested the earpiece in another phone/device ? 




 iPhone 6 here, updated from 8.1. Definitely an improvement 




 i had similiar issues and i restored and it's fine now 




 I think at this point everyone know the issues the world has but they think the real problems won't be faced by them. Instead, they'll be faced by their grandchildren

 March 2016 ? I believe we'll see Skylake windows machines still this year maybe October November. I'd like to see an update for both 13" and 15" MBP. Maybe January/February 




 I like the fact Apple works to keep these devices up to date and working flawlessly and smooth  




 The 2011 was rubbish, even compared to Office 2010 for windows  




 Thanks for correcting me, in that case you don't need to update. When the new beta comes out update to the public if you want to 




 Source of the Nile definitely. Clarkson explains how "speed and power" solves everything 




 magic behind the wheel and max revs 




 selling animals? they're not their property  




 I believe they're the same build, in that case, you don't need to switch. If you're not a dev when a new beta comes out you won't be able to update OTA. I don't know how it works in public betas. 




 the only difference is the box that it comes in. New laptop, warranty, it's a great buy 




 It is ? Do you carry it everyday ? I'm thinking about one but to carry it everyday it might be uncomfortable...  




 you can use Wine but it's a battery killer and heats the laptop a lot.. Don't use it for heavier apps. You can give it a try but you should also try VMware/parallels
 




 you can update it to test, you can downgrade if you feel it's buggy or what not 




 short answer: no
reason: 8.3 is no longer signed by Apple
if you want to update your device it must be to 8.4 




 I was thinking about buying one but they say "don't try this at home" so I wouldn't be able to test it ... So, I'm not going to buy it then 




 because the usb is type C 




 I think with skylake we will see a new design... Apple loves thunderbolt and the new thunderbolt uses USB-C .. We shall see 




 You have to restore, I had a simile issue 




 I think the Iris Pro is powerful enough if you don't want to game or weavy veideo/photo editing 




 have you restored or updated to 8.4 ? 




 It happens with every Apple product ... just a shame .. $1999 in the US, in Europe it's 1999, just ridiculous 




 yeah, they wanted to buy a fiat 500 and it was 500 million 




 just tell me how can someone dislike that video, it's brilliant ! 




 In the latest I don't know. I tried with 1.1.18 




 8.4 is the last version, all the tweaks will be updated (hopefully) to 8.4. It brings a new music app. If you want to update you'll have to backup your device and then restore it 




 i think it's the best you can do 




 without losing jailbreak it's impossible. It's not recommended to to an OTA update. After you have 8.4 you'll need a computer to jailbreak 




 you can transfer the music form your iPad to your mom's iTunes, make a backup there, restore, jb and restore from the backup 




 I restored from backup after jailbreaking and cydia was empty 




 keep your umbrella opened, it'll never rain again 




 I solved that issue by using a different USB port 




 you can restore from backup, then sync with iTunes. All apps will be where they were before you restored 




 it has to work, make sure you backup and restore from backup after jailbreak
 




 I guess restore 




 the repos and tweaks are not saved in the iTunes backup 




 And sometimes he definitely is  




 similar to iOS 9 i guess not, but you can install the beta, surely you'll lose the jb

 I think you'll only benefit 16gb ram if you really need it. The 2015 also has better battery and the new trackpad  




 The price of the maxed 13" MacBook is almost the same as the base 15" I think it's worth it  




 Light Mac desktop only a Mac mini  




 I guess only time will tell 




 yeah I know 




 Sure is but I never heard a person with a 13in rMBP saying it is heavy and difficult to carry everyday in a backpack 




 That's definitely not normal ! Take it to an Apple store 




 he was convinced the P1 was faster 




 I'd love to see which one was the fastest around the track .. We'll never know 




 You have a good excuse :D I was thinking that ! In that case you have to check if your tweaks are working in the latest firmware. 




 you can only update to 8.4 or 9 beta
Can I ask you why are you not updating the iPhone ? 




 it's not possible, it's possible the other way round though

 Your mighty Range Rover was defeated by what's it called, bamboo ? 




 I know and it saves a lot of battery  




 It's okay :) I just prefer the bigger screen and (better) speakers as well as 16gb ram as I have a lot of things running at once  




 Yes but windows users are used to alt+tab and in OSX it doesn't work as they intended it to. Sure there is the correct shortcut
Another thing: if you have 2 windows of the same application running on 2 different spaces, if I want to open a third windows on a different space, I click on the icon on the dock and it doesn't open a new window, it takes me to a random window of the running application   




 alt+tab doesn't switch between windows. Instead, switch between apps 




 I don't do video and the base model is already expensive for me...  




 For me it'd be a main machine. The 15" is definitely a desktop replacement and with  its portability it's a great machine. Sure it's expensive but I'm yet to hear someone that bought one and was unhappy with it. Everyone I know say it's the best computer they have ever owned 




 Yes ! It also smells like brand new  




 only in September maybe  




 13" 2015 model is actually 4 months old, great deal !  




 I have to carry my laptop almost everyday, but I think the slightly bigger and heavier MacBook is worth it. In a backpack it won't be a big difference between the two

 I don't need the dedicated gpu, and 250GB is enough to for me. Need the ram and the cpu is pretty much the same. I believe it flies ! 




 It's the Albanian rozzers! 




 ... It's time to end, thank you very much for watching, good night 




 I agree with you, the end was a bit off the the rest of it was absolutely TopGear! Jeremy wears a tie and says he is not an old truck driver with egg on his shirt and Hammond arrives with egg on his shirt. The modifications to the truck "sports lorry". It was a normal special with a lot of laughs

 yes, filmed with a drone. Also from the burma special 




 imagine the g force 
























 why iOS 6 ? 




 truth is, the engine started ! 




 Yes, in the end it all comes to that :D I'm waiting for the new model since I don't work in the Summer but if you need a machine now, it's definitely a great computer and you won't regret it ! 




 Got it, it's a nice feature. 




 I'll tell them I've bought an Harley Davidson 




 I think it's the best looking golf ever 




 Hammond called Jezza idiot instead of ape, interesting 




 Clarkson and his presents, so original 




 skylake will have better performance compared to haswell/broadwell. The current model uses haswell cpus, the new ones will be a bit faster, as usual, and have better efficiency ! My bet is the new skylake macs will have a new design since thunderbolt 3 uses usb-c and Apple loves thunderbolt. 




 My bet is the middle of the pond 




 I'll give it a try, thnks  




 Why the downvotes ? I was saying what they always say 




 I know the new early 2015 13" MacBook is pretty much silent. Sure it'll become audible if you push it. you'll hear the noise but it's not intrusive   




 Only Apple ahah 




 the 12'' MacBook would be better for your Portability and lightness priority. However, you'll have to pay for it,  and for the same price you can have the retina MacBook which is faster and is also very portable 




 My iPhone is jailbroken and it lasts over 2 days. Sure it's not used intensively but it has WiFi enabled all the time, LTE occasionally, a few tweaks and themes with Winterboard. You can try it, if you dislike having it, just restore it

 They're very similar, we can argue until the world ends but it's just a question of OS

 don't need DFU, just hit restore from backup in iTunes 




 update to the beta instead of restoring, and you're good to go 




 the new one is expected, as usual, in October 




 in these cases more is always better but i've used a 2014 13'' rMBP with 8GB of Ram and it handled photoshop and illustrator at the same time pretty well. Sure, if you open more apps it'll start to compress memory but the ssd is so fast it doesn't slow down 




 upgrade the ram if you can, you'll see minor gains in the cpu though

 I used Alfred in Mavericks, but I stopped using it when Yosemite came out with the new spotlight 




 Since you said you're computer is dying and running hot and slow I guess it'd make a difference ... The 15'' macbooks are crazy fast 




 That's a missing feature for me... I'm currently jailbroken because there are many things too simple in iOS and that is one of them 




 You're right, they're expensive not to buy but to maintain ... But I think BMW makes better, more reliable and efficient cars than Alfa, they seem to put more thought into it 




 I'll give it a try. I asked because there are a ton of writing programs 




 It's a classic "feature", it's been there since the original ... The problem is the border at the top has to be the same size  




 4.7 inches are perfect... Just reduce those borders and it might be possible to fit a larger display in the same phone  




 Why there's no different sound volumes for calls, alarms, reminders ? I want to have the sound of calls louder than my alarms... The iPhone surprisingly doesn't allow me to do it... After 9 iterations its still not possible  




 How does Alfred stack up with the new spotlight ? 




 Transmission is too much minimalistic  




 Why iA writer is the best you have ever used ? 




 You upgrade what you can afford 




 you cannot upgrade the ram in any MacBook 




 you cannot upgrade the ram in any MacBook 




 the next 15'' will definitely have Skylake the question is if it's going to be released in 2015 or early 2016 ... I'm praying for October, iPad event 




 I'd love to see longer episodes of those specials ... TopGear is (was) so much more than cars! 




 if the 16GB of RAM weren't enough I don't know what to do since you cannot have more than that! :D The 6100 works well with Photoshop, sure the 15'' will be faster and so on, but it depends on what kind of work you do. It'd be a great buy. It's the sweet spot between power and portability 




 That RS6 I referred is the "old" model. The 2015 Audi A6 Avant is beautiful ... I don't know if ABT have tuned it. 




 I understand what you mean. The E46 was really about the engine, the E92 was more civilized. The new one I think they're ugly ... I prefer the M4, it's a great car inside as it is on the outside and it has a great engine. The interior of this Alfa is nice, but I don't like how they are on the outside with tar triangular grill 




 that 50cal lighter :D 




 Sure, but I'd rather have a BMW than an Alfa 




 We're all forgetting about the Christmas special, from Iraq to Bethlehem 
























 Your head isn't the real world. I know what you mean by tower. compare a full size tower pc to a mac pro, you gotta admit they're different. I'm talking about aesthetics. Sure both are desktop computers. We're talking the same thing but we're not understanding each other. Go ahead with a MacPro, it can handle 3 4k displays, you won't regret it. 




 I understand your point of view, you say tower to a desktop it's fine. The MacPro is a desktop, so it's also a tower so to speak 




 AMD* And the MacPro isn't a tower. Why do you need a laptop hooked to 3 monitors ? Sure it's a main machine you can take with you wherever you go but that's tough. That's too many pixels to drive from a laptop 




 Because it's thin its rounded edges but it doesn't have a curved back like the HTC 




 The phone is definitely beautiful without a case but it's very slippery and I use a case just for security. And without scratches it's better to sell it

 4s iOS 7 ? That's probably the worse OS for the 4s... iOS8 is way better and the new betas of iOS9 shows a totally different phone. It's wayy smoother than iOS7 




 iPhones don't need as much RAM as android phones ... 1GB has been enough. The iPad has 2 now, so I guess the iPhone will follow, but it will have 2GB for a looooong time. 




 I don't like the protruding camera but it doess't bother me either... I use a case so the phone stands flat on a table...  




 they're just playing with us. They know the average number of apps per user is over 100, plus pics and music ... It's well over 16GB 




 I definitely agree the camera design is ridiculous but it's actually not a big deal after a while. Sure the phone isn't flat on a table and with a case it's normal... 




 I guess everyone is either angry because they won't have enough space or they'll have to pay the extra $100... Just put the base model at 32GB ! 




 0.2 mm thicker is the difference between the iPhone 6 and 6+... 6.9 and 7.1mm ... It's the same thing! 




 yeah, and it's not even the full 16GB which is worse ! 




 They know the average person has at least over 100 apps installed but they keep the base at 16GB ... 




 I never had such problem ... but I know it's a problem for a long time. 8.4 didn't fixed it ? 




 We will explain how it affects aerodynamics 




 no, when I jailbroke, in the end, when the phone was rebooting I got the blue screen for about 1 sec and never got it again 




 I find it very portable. Sure it's bigger and heavier than the 13'' but it's definitely portable for a 15'' machine. Carrying it in a backpack every single day. 




 "Are you asleep yet" ahah 




 I don't know ... After seeing the truck so close and James' face, I doubt  it. But I want to believe it escaped 




 I think this is a great feature because the app switcher is rubbish. It takes ages to double click the home button, choose an app and do something. I think it needs a refinement 




 It hides it but it's just temporarily.  




 Definitely, the S65 AMG absolutely flies ! It's an heavy car and it's super luxurious. I think it's the most expensive car Mercedes makes  




 There is. When you're forced to watch a movie you don't like ahah  




 The iTunes account isn't a problem, you can create it easily. I think your mom will like having  the iPad since it's not hard to use it  




 I guess many people don't use that feature because they don't even know it's there but it's very useful. Some mobile sites are completely useless  




 That'd be problematic but what kind of show are you expecting ? I'd love the new program to be exactly like Topgear like you described but the cenario, intro and many other things cannot be similar to the one they had at bbc. They're original and they'll come out with something the fans will definitely enjoy  




 "Speed and power solve many things" 




 i want the whole app back... Just enjoy the new album artwork 




 his face says it all "SPEEEEEED". He looks like an angry man Hrrrr 




 It's gonna be 7.99 




 I just want the new show to have the same "layout", with the news section, challenges, special episodes and do on. They might have to change something, I don't know 




 That'd be very nice. Netflix is expanding to Europe in the fall 




 what? 




 very tough choice indeed. I guess I'd choose the 918. Feels like it's smaller and more civilized but I don't know... I might prefer another one in a minute 




 Okay, the best version for the 4s is iOS 6 definitely. 7 is unusable... The betas of iOS 9 show s huge improvement though. Downgrade to anything newer than 6.1. 




 Just feel the speed. Classic Jeremy 




 Keep in mind how thin it is! It's a great battery life 




 I also started with an iPod touch, it was amazing, few months later got the iPhone 4s, then an iPad, then the 5s, then the 6. I'm gonna buy a rMBP shortly. True bastards ! hehe 




 "Oh look, there's a hippo's head! No, I think there's an entire hippo beneath the water" Who remembers this ? 




 who filmed the birds? As we know the TopGear camera crew struggle when they're not filming cars 




 never saw anyone fix an electric problem with a hammer  




 have you fixed an electric problem with a hammer ? 
























 the iPad has a very good screen, camera, size, weight, cpu, battery and so on. They cannot stand still though 




 I'm not sure, but I think it was Jeremy.  




 Unavailable ? Why?

 




 They weren't presenters, they were top gear ! 









 I guess these are the last breath of the iPod family 




 Another technique from Jeremy is when he used a rope and a lawnmower to cut the grass automatically. It was when the guys went to India to promove Britain  









 Yes, it has been improved. But we cannot do anything regarding earthquakes 














 Real Racing 3 [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/real-racing-3/id556164008?mt=8) [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.games.r3_na) 









 There's nothing to be improved in the Air2 ? 














 I guess there's no way to get things which weren't backed up :/ 




 restore from backup and sync.  




 don't get the 5c. get the 5s intead. you can wait until Apple releases the 6s and get the 6 




 so, with skylake the 15'' will have 10 hours 




 Enable LTE, kill all apps , and so on. I guess they are aware of these missing features. They should read reddit and /r/jailbreak to understand what the community is developing to improve the iOS functionality 




 check the refurbished store. There's already the 2015 13'' retina MacBook there. At the moment they're not available but I've seen them. Check the site frequently. You can get a great deal there 




 The 2015 13'' retina is available in the refurbished section. At the moment there's no 2015 model but i've seen them and it's a great deal. 




 I wanna know how they managed to add an additional hour to the 15'' with the same cpu 




 I'm older than I was 5 minutes ago! Oh god! ahah, nice shower thought 




 oh cock ... 




 but the iPhone has 1GB not 3 and yet it might be better 




 And no song either  




 Yes. Jeremy showed them when the guys were showing the modified SUVs 




 The site is updated regularly 




 Basically, I'm saying they're a great transport and I'm also saying they're not. 




 That's right. You see people complaining about the 8MP camera, dual core cpu, screen res. "It only has that and it's that price? no quad core, no 3gb ram, no 16MP shooter? It's a rubbish phone with a huge price tag". Those are the people that never owned one. Just like macs
 




 Memory management is an issue with the S6 




 wat wat ? 




 Doesn't the resolution of the screen affects these results? 




 There's even a tutorial regarding all the gestures for the trackpad within the preferences menu, everything is built in  




 Knife cutting cheese, I saw it in /r/pics 




 They suck, they're a great transport and yet they're completely outdated. Of course they're faster and secure but they always have the same destination, you know what I mean? 




 I guess how much it'd weigh 




 I guess it's viral everywhere now  




 Sell it on eBay ! 




 Will you carry an empty backpack  ? 




 That must have been with the Merc 




 16 is just not enough for the majority of people. I have 64 and I have 14 gb left. Pictures, music, apps are using more and more space 




 Gather a bit more and get the 5s. You won't regret it  




 I won't, trust me. I'm an engineer 




 but no one is killing our parents ! 




 Facebook is also killing Flash 




 The 11s might be slightly thinner. It's better to wait  




 10s no, wait for the next one 



































































































 the first one is epic 




 well spotted 




 The Air2 already has. The new iPhone is expected to have as well  














 ?? 














 diamonds in the headlights, nice 




 the 2015 has 10 hours, it's 9 vs 10 














 But he might have done the motherfucker of all tail slides in the Merc 














 This is why TopGear is (was) TopGear. Let's build an ambulance!
Jeremy (the ape): "Here's the perfect solution - Porsche 944" 









 go check the snow in Australia 





























 The 13" also has hyperthreading 




 iPhone 6 specs inside a smaller 4" iPod. no idea why there's the 16gb model. Maybe because to keep the the price of the base model down  




 The A8X is triple core and the core M is dual core. 




 if you bump the cpu, ram, ssd of the 13'' will turn out to be a decision about the size of both macbooks 




 16:10 excellent for coding 



















 Yeah, they have to show the production vehicle of the Model X 









 Hammond would say it's the intelligence of the average ape 
































































 I think the iPhone isn't an iPhone without the home button. But it's becoming a barrier to the iPhone's design. The top and bottom bezels are too big in my opinion and that's due to the home button. Look at the LG G3 or G4 for instance. They have small bezels and the bigger screen doesn't seem as big... 







































 Apple didn't invent the shape. The article says the future of tablets is 4:3 instead of 16:9 

















































 you're right. Another thing is, the home button cannot have the metal ring "inside" the screen. Am I right ? 




 I use safari with 3 tabs max and it's usable. Sure it's slow compared to the iPhone but it's from 2012. It's a usable iPad for reading magazines, books and web 





























 It's nice to have a device with 5 years and to be used daily. I have an iPad 3 and it lags a bit with iOS8 in safari, but it's usable for everyday tasks. I use it everyday 



















 iOS 7 in the 4 was rubbish, way to laggy. In the 4s it was also laggy. iOS 9 in the 4s is smooth 









 yes 




 In short: It's really good. Night and day compared to iOS7 







































 he destroyed the back tires of the SLS 
























 It's also an entry device for the apple ecosystem. The iPod touch 4th gen was my first Apple device. Two iPhones and one iPad came next
