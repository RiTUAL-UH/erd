 Still, I can't help wondering if the puritanism found in some places in the Pali Canon is an historical artifact, resulting from a general disparagement of the physical body that seems to have become common in India and elsewhere[...] such attitudes were apparently part of the cultural milleu the Buddha was raised in. Or did they arise afterward, and were inserted into the Canon later?

Whether or not such metaphysical considerations were a factor, other, more basic issues must have been important. Some of them are obvious and have already been mentioned. Monastic sexual activity would be a distraction to say the least, and expend a lot of energy that would be better used in other ways. Think of how much time and effort sexual affairs and liaisons can involve, even when they are not secretive. Add to that all the tensions and jealousies that would be created within the Sangha.

Already it becomes apparent that having a more relaxed attitude toward sex would be fatal to the spiritual focus of the community. However, at least two other concerns must also have weighed heavily.

We tend to forget that until the 1960s there was really no reliable contraception. Since Buddhism prohibited abortion and infanticide, sex meant babies, and all the work of caring for them and raising themespecially the unremitting daily task of providing enough food, which is incompatible with a mendicant life. The consequences of this can be seen in the cautionary tale of Japanese Buddhism. Japanese culture has always viewed our natural urges as...well, natural. That very much includes the sexual urge, and many if not most temple monks had common-law wives and children before they were legally permitted to marry after the Meji Restoration. The task of providing for them eventually transformed the temple into a family business, with the oldest son expected to become a priest to keep that temple business in the family, regardless of whether he had any religious inclinations. As a result, Japanese Buddhism today is a thriving (and lucrative) industry focusing on funerals and memorial services, and not much else.

One more factor may have been the most important of all. Buddhist monastics are traditionally dependent on lay support. This means that the Sangha must be very sensitive to the expectations of their supporters. For example, Chinese monks and nuns became vegetarian not because their vows required it but because the laity began to expect it. Also, needless to say, it wouldn't do to have monks seducing their supporters' daughters (or sons). Moreover, laymen and women would not look kindly upon sharing their hard-earned food and other resources with renunciants who, instead of devoting themselves to their spiritual practice, spend time dallying with lovers.  Even today, when monks in southeast Asian countries like Thailand are discovered with girlfriends, it's sometimes the local lay community that takes the initiative in forcibly disrobing them.

To sum up, there are many strong reasons for the Buddhist Sangha to be strictly celibate. Which of these were the important factors? Early Buddhist texts do not help us decide among them, but my guess is that all of them were.

How does this shed light upon our situation today? If it is more or less inclusive, there are major implications for Western Buddhism, because few if any of those reasons for celibacy are valid for lay practitioners today.

Yes, there are still times (periods of intensive practice) and places (within practice communities) when sexual abstention is obviously wise to observe. Few Western Buddhists, however, still look upon nature, women, and sex as impure entanglements to be avoided. Most of us don't have to worry about what our lay supporters think, because we don't have any, at least not in the traditional sense. Today we have access to effective means of birth-control, so babies usually aren't an issue unless and until we want them to be. A new category of Buddhist has become common in the West: less than monastic in lifestyle (hence not subject to Sangha vows or regulations) but also more devoted to practice than laity have usually been.[...]

So...does that mean we can breathe more easily now, as we accept and enjoy the new sexual freedoms? Not quite yet. There is another aspect of sexual relationships that we need to be aware of, and it's one that is not usually acknowledged.[...]

Our own cultural perspective should not be taken for granted, as if it provided some universal standard. Present Western attitudes are historically conditioned too, in this case by a myth about romantic love that evolved in late medieval Europe[...]

Although some of the emphasis has shifted from finding the right spouse to finding the right sexual partner, there is still the same expectation of personal fulfillment whether through romance or sexual intimacy. Buddhism questions that conscious or unconscious expectation, just as it challenges other myths that predispose us to seek happinessthe end of *dukkha*in an unskillful way.

Sexual intimacy is a source of pleasure and gratification, and a very nice one it can be; it can also help create and sustain deeper, more meaningful relationships. Nevertheless, the sex drive is basically biological. Sex is an appetite. We do not use our sexual organs; they use us. That is why there is ultimately something delusive about the myths of romantic love and sexual fulfillment. Sex is nature's way, and marriage is society's way, to reproduce the species. Genuine happinessthat is, the end of *dukkha* for any of the parties involved has little if anything to do with it.

 **The Method of Discourse**


We often find references to four stages in which the Buddha would initiate and conclude a discourse. The first stage is represented as "pointing out" (*sandasseti*), that is, indicating the problem. If it was in reference to an individual, the Buddha would explain that person's situation. If it concerned an event, thing, or phenomenon, the Buddha would attempt to create some "agitation" (*samuttejeti*) by emphasizing the non-substantiality of the individual, event, thing, or phenomenon. This is the process of deconstruction, intended to avoid any ontological commitment. If the discourse is concluded at this point, the person to whom it is addressed will be left in a state of anxiety. During the third stage, the agitation is immediately appeased (*sampahaseti*) by pointing to a way out of the problem. This is the process of reconstruction or redefinition, which is achieved through the positive doctrine of dependent arising explaining the subject, the object, and morality and freedom. In doing so, the Buddha recognized the capacity of language to communicate the content of human experience, whether that relates to facts or values. In the final stage, the Buddha makes no effort to convert the hearer to his way of thinking, for the hearer tends to accept his explanation without much ado (*samadpesi*).

The discourse (*dhamma*) formulated in terms of language thus becomes the means of communication. Communication, not only among those who speak different languages but also among those who speak the same language, becomes impossible if one adopts either of the approaches toward language criticized by the Buddha, namely, strict adherence or transgression. The first would imply that each conception utilized in language has its incorruptible object (ontological commitment) unavailable to human experience, while the second would imply that human experience is incommunicable through language (that is, linguistic transcendence). The Buddha seems to have realized that the former is more perverse that the latter. His method of communication therefore deals first with the problem of ontological commitment and then with linguistic transcendence. 


This is an extremely significant method of communication and conversion, based on the Buddha's understanding of human psychology. His contemporaries, who failed to understand the psychological significance of this method of discourse, saw him as a person possessed of the magical power of conversion (*vaan my*). Yet there was no magic or mystery involved. All that the Buddha did was carefully observe the intellectual maturity and psychological state of each person and provide a discourse that would produce beneficial consequences for him. The Chinese version of the Agama passage that refers to the four stages rightly characterizes them as the Buddha's "skill in means".

"Skill in means" does not imply converting someone by discoursing on something that is obviously false. In fact, the two stages of causing agitation (*samuttejana*) and appeasement (*sampahasana*) correspond, respectively, to deconstruction of solidified conceptions through analysis (*vibhga*), which is the function of the doctrine of non-substantiality (*anatta*), and reconstruction of the same conception by the method of explanation (*vykaraa*), which is achieved through the principle of dependence (*paticcasmuppda*). Both these processes allow for a great degree of flexibility and are intended to eliminate both absolutism and nihilism.

'A History of Buddhist Philosophy - Continuities and Discontinuities' by David J. Kalupahana, (University of Hawaii Press; 1992) pp.65-67. 









 The preparation for the bodhisattva path is the unification of body and mind: the body works for the mind and the mind works for the body. The hinayana shamaha and vipashyna practices make the mind precise, tanquil and smooth in the positive sense - precisely being there, rather than dreaming or sleeping or hazily perceiving. We can make a cup of tea properly, because the body and mind are synchronized.

Then we are ready to leap on to the bodhisattva path, to open to the joy of working with sentient beings, including oneself. The bodhisattva makes friends with himself as well as with others. There are no mysterious, dark corners left of which to be suspicious; no surprises can occur to destroy the bodhisattva's spiritual intelligence, his dignity and heroism. This is the first step, the first *bhumi* or spiritual level.

The word 'bhumi' in Sanskrit, or the word *sa* in Tibetan, means 'earth' or 'level' or 'ground', the ground where you can relate with yourself and others. There is no mystification, no confusion; it is obviously solid earth. In other words, it is the equivalent of the basic sanity, fundamentally being *there*. Since the bodhisattva knows his body and his mind and how to relate with the two, the whole process becomes 'skillful means' because of such transcendental security. Which is more like being *in* security rather than being secured, rather than watching yourself to make sure everything is okay. That fundamental security comes from realizing that you have broken through something. You reflect back and realize that you used to be extraordinarily paranoid and neurotic, watching each step you made, thinking you might lose your sanity, that situations were always threatening in some way. Now you are free of all those fears and preconceptions. You discover that you have something to give rather than having to demand from others, having to grasp all the time. For the first time, you are a rich person, you contain basic sanity. You have something to offer, you are able to work with your fellow sentient beings, you do not have to reassure yourself anymore. Reassurance implies a mentality of povertyyou are checking yourself, 'Do I have it? How could I do it?' But the bodhisattva's delight in his richness is based upon experience rather than theory or wishful thinking. It is *so*, directly, fundamentally. He is fundamentally right and so can delight in generosity.

 Furthermore, if we cling to our being Christians, Jews, atheists or Buddhists, we 
will always be worried about what people may think of Jesus and the Christians, of Jews, 
of atheists, or of Buddha and the Buddhistsand when those with whom we identify are 
insulted, we will get offended and suffer, and we might even be willing to fight and thus 
run the risk of suffering blows, pain, bruises, wounds and even death (or to cause any of 
these damages to our opponent). However, if we defeat our adversary we will remain 
dissatisfied as well, since we will never be able to convince him that we are right, and he 
will keep on having a negative opinion of Christians, Jews, atheists or Buddhists. This 
dynamic is at the root of conflicts between groups, and in particular of warswhich, 
given the characteristics and number of present weapons, in the best of cases produce a 
drastic acceleration of the process of self destruction of humanity and, in the worst of 
cases, might cause the immediate destruction of life on our planet. Thus Krishnamurti 
was right when he asserted that, so long as we are this or that (which, as will be shown in 
the next chapter, in the context of this book means so long as we delusorily value our 
being this or that), we are responsible for wars and for confrontations between groups, 
with all their negative consequenceswhich nowadays may even involve global 
destruction.

      Memory is a prism through which 

     yesterdays's light is passed;

     Split into a rainbow of moments 

     each colored more dimly than the last. 

     How will today's light look tomorrow

     Would the filter of time be as brutal

     if that prism were two-way?

 I asked this question a while back in /r/AskLiteraryStudies - [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/1l83m6/portrayals_of_healthy_sexual_relationships/) . Can anyone think of examples in literature in which a long-term sexual-relationship is depicted as happy, healthy and non-neurotic? 





































































 I've realised that I've been practising the karuna-bhavana instead of the metta-bhavana. At the Triratna centre that I go to they teach the metta-bhavana to beginners. Whenever I do it I find myself trying to 'put myself in the shoes of' whoever it is I'm visualising. For, how can one love someone when one does not make an attempt to comprehend their situation? This entails compassion - i.e. karuna. 

Today, while going through the stages of the metta-bhavana I felt truly powerful paroxysms of pity. It was difficult to breathe and stay seated upright. It took a great deal of effort to regain composure.

I understand now why the karuna-bhavana is reserved for more advanced practitioners. What I would like to know is if anyone has any tips on how I can practise the metta-bhavana without having this problem again? How can one try to demarcate the metta-bhavana from the karuna-bhavana? 




 I was racking my mind to think if I'd read any novels (and plays/poems) that portray a positive, lasting sexual relationship.

Just as I was writing this, I remembered the relationship between the protagonist of McEwan's 'Saturday' and his wife. Apart from that, I found examples a bit thin on the ground.

Can anyone provide me with examples in literature in which a long-term sexual-relationship is depicted as happy and healthy and non-neurotic? 














     I've been high and I've been low. 
    And I know which I'd rather be. 

    At the top of the atmosphere it starts to get lighter - 
    All the colours, whiter and whiter.

    Around us all, beyond the air, 
    The whirling, crushing cosmos bear,
    Lonely. Unfair.

    The cosmos absorbs us all so small.
    Still love. Still pity.

Moral of the story: Cherish wise attention. Value a-voidance.
 




 I've been high and I've been low. And I know which I'd rather be. As you get to the top of the livable atmosphere it starts becoming lighter - more enlightened. Beyond - the vasty dark cosmos. Wise attention. Value a-voidance. 




 Does anyone have a memory from before you learnt how to speak?  


































 Meditation is about stilling the mind so we can see clearly. Meditation is about getting into the actual life and experience of our consciousness. Meditation reveals how wonderful life could be. How free we could be. Meditation, and a simple ethical life, reveals the deep habits that have been a vital condition for evolutionary success: the single-minded urge for supremacy over other members of our own species; the survival of the fittest; of the quickest; of the strongest; of the randiest; the survival of the most cunning and selfish; of the best at supporting and promoting of oneself and one's kin; and, of course, the selfish exploitation of other species.

Probably all currently surviving species have been a condition in the extinction of all other competing or edible species. We are the first species to attempt to enforce fishing quotas and to limit our urges to hunt. Meditation and an ethical life increasingly reveals another possibility - a life beyond self-clinging beyond self-promotion - a life of empathy. Shantideva says, 'When fear and suffering are disliked by me and others equally, what is so special about me that I protect me and not the other.'

All of us need to respond to the suffering in the world. Are we going to respond more like an animal or more like a Buddha?

 I had a house party the other day and have several opened but unfinished cans of lager that have gone flat. It seems wasteful to pour them down the drain. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I should do with the lager? 




 I believe that the following passages prove that the figure of Jesus should be considered, using the language of today, **a blood-thirsty terrorist**:

* "But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them  bring them here and kill them in front of me. (Luke 19:27 NIV)

* "He that is not with me is against me..." (Matthew 12:30 KJV)

* "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword." (Matthew 10:34 NIV)

I believe that were he simply an advocate of peace and 'turning the other cheek' it would be unlikely that the Romans would have scourged and crucified him. It is my view that he was most likely a perpetrator and advocate of violence, and that his subsequent portrayal as a pacifist is the result of historical revisionism. 





































































 I believe that belief in the divinity of Mohammed, and therefore the inviolability of the Qu'ran, is a central part of being a Muslim. In accordance with the fact that the Qu'ran instructs Muslims to ''wage war against the unbelievers'', ''cast terror into the unbelievers' hearts'', and ''forsake this world for the next'', becoming a terrorist is the logical outcome of being a Muslim. CMV.

EDIT: I have changed my view somewhat (see below). Thank you to everyone who contributed to the discussion.

 I was watching a moth pottering around. Do they live lives of constant fear? Or can they experience joy and happiness? Was wondering if it would be humane to squash it or not.

 Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell commented on the passing of Baroness Thatcher, saying she was extraordinary for mostly the wrong reasons, but going on to say: I dont rejoice in her death. I commiserate, as I do with the death of any person.

He continued: In 1988, the Thatcher government legislated Britains first new anti-gay law in 100 years: Section 28. At the 1987 Conservative party conference she mocked people who defended the right to be gay, insinuating that there was no such right.

During her rule, arrests and convictions for consenting same-sex behaviour rocketed, as did queer bashing violence and murder. Gay men were widely demonised and scapegoated for the AIDS pandemic and Thatcher did nothing to challenge this vilification.

 That the thought of men being made to play Doom^TM and then being given a gun (or an Xbox controller) and being asked to kill **human beings** doesn't trouble you. 

 









 I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and presume you're a troll.
 




 What he thinks... means nothing

To criticise with compassion is more skillful than to criticise with hatred. Hatred blinds. Someone doesn't need to be a degree-laden 'psychiatrist' to have meaningful things to say. George Lucas has created beautiful films (American Graffiti), and has self-consciously exploited the study of personality archetypes as successfully as anyone else (Star Wars). But more important than that - he is an elder of our tribe. Something tells me you had forgotten that. Correct me if I'm wrong.

All bodies pass through the universal substance, as it were into and out of a rushing stream; cohering and cooperating with the whole, as do our physical members with one another. How many a Chrysippus, a Socrates, an Epictetus has been engulfed by time! Remember this where you have to do with any man or thing whatsoever. 




 Has anyone else reported Foldit or Eyewire causing the 'blue screen of death'? Or is it just coincidence? 




 That website has a .mil ending. 

Doom^TM is ugliness layered upon ugliness. The words 'modern military' conjure up images of Americans killing Pakistani families with Xbox controllers. And yes that is going on. 




 Linking it there shouldn't discount my arguments (which you can respond to if being logical should take your fancy. lol!). If I had submitted it to /r/getUndisciplined however...  




 So that's what they mean when they say 'butthurt'... 




 You can subscribe to religious ethics without realising you are subscribing to religious ethics.

 **Protestant work ethic** *n.* the view that to be successful through hard work is a person's duty and responsibility, which, according to Max Weber's analysis, first evolved in Protestant Europe through the teachings of Calvin. 




 Another reason it is called that is that the video game industry obeys that holiest of capitalist maxims - thou shalt not kill the cash cow. (Sometimes Moses reminds me of myself...) 




 Thought so; you were just blustering.  




 You should look at /u/rawkuts's example. I hope she is able to change some of your views too. 




 Very good. 




 How much of it do I have to play before I 'help science'? 




 * I know I'm not the only one who thinks it's a ridiculous name so you're wrong there.

* Why is it called that? and Does it involve killing?

* Just because someone is a good artist doesn't make them a good person. I'd rather have Eminem as an associate than a son-in-law. And by 'old school games' I take it you're not referring to chess? 




 Wrong, wrong, wrong.

I was trying to discourage those, (perhaps you fall into this category, perhaps not), who stumble blindly in the hell-realm that is addiction to video-games. I know a man who is in his thirties and plays video games. People mock him behind his back about it, and he has admitted to me that he feels 'shame' (his word) about his habit. True story. I, out of compassion, would like to save others from his fate.

And, **I was trying to encourage** the rays of hope out there, (One must never abandon hope. It was not without reason some Catholic theologians called despair 'the one unforgivable sin'), the comparatively enlightened video game apologist (like rawkuts) into singing in this chillest of chill lands. 

I don't know what you are or aren't envious of. I can assure you however that the video game prison looks less attractive from the outside than from within.

Perhaps drugs can help one ['to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield'](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174659), perhaps they can't. One thing for sure is that they make for a better [Lotos](http://www.bartleby.com/42/638.html) than does video games. 

Edit: added brackets for clarity 




 Is there greater wisdom than: 'Forgive them, Father. They know not what they do'? If there is, is that what you were employing with your snide dismissal of Lucas in your second paragraph? You might think I'm being facetious but this exchange, I believe, highlights precisely the foibles that civilised fellow-produce-of-the-Big-Bang and enlightened 'fellow passengers to the grave' shouldn't have. 




 What on earth do you know about Buddhist teachings on ego and pride?

 It wasn't merely smug condescension. When I was a philosophy undergraduate at university they said the SEP was often more advanced than our purposes required. Equating an unknown Reddit user with an undergraduate philosophy student is not condescension (unless, perhaps it occurs in a sub such as /r/Academia). 




 Best comment yet. Still looking at your first link. The first comment to make me think of delta-ing someone. (Such a shame that it looks like a dunce's cap, though. Why couldn't they have picked any other letter?) 




 a) The science seems to state that video games do have a negative effect - http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/caa/abstracts/2010-2014/10ASISBSRS.pdf. Read that and see if you then disagree. 

b) Other things being bad does not mean that video games are good.

c) I think you missed some of the subtlety of my original explicatory comment. I said that any good engendered by games is nullified by the pallid tone in which they cast 'reality'. Perhaps you'd like to tell me more about Spec Ops. My prejudices are telling me that, going on the first two words alone, the game is not one made by a devotee of Francis of Assisi or the Lord Buddha! Please disabuse me.  




 The suggestion that an American soldier could possibly not be morally corrupted I consider risible. (If that's 'rude or hostile to other users', then sobeit. I'd find it rude and hostile to humanity for me not to say it.) 




 Everything is conditioning. I parse from your comment then that you subscribe to the 'Protestant work ethic'. I'd say that someone or something 'corrupted' you into thinking that. Additionally if I found other assumptions of yours that I believe don't cohere with reality I believe I would attribute them to either corruption or ignorance. 




 An overly jaundiced take on proceedings. 




 Sorry I had overlooked that. Some things strike different people as needing to be justified.

Here's one: [Violent Video Game Effects on Aggression, Empathy, and Prosocial
Behavior in Eastern and Western Countries: A Meta-Analytic Review.](http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/caa/abstracts/2010-2014/10ASISBSRS.pdf) 




 You truly don't see this?

Yes. It might help you to understand where I'm coming from if I told you that I'm beyond Good and Evil inasmuch as I think instead in regards to that which is *kusala* and *akusala* or 'skillful' and 'unskillful'. The idea that some people know more and are wiser than others is non-negotiable and incontrovertible to my mind.

Relevant: 

"Abandon what is unskillful, monks. It is possible to abandon what is unskillful. If it were not possible to abandon what is unskillful, I would not say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.' But because it is possible to abandon what is unskillful, I say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.' If this abandoning of what is unskillful were conducive to harm and pain, I would not say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.' But because this abandoning of what is unskillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure, I say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.'

"Develop what is skillful, monks. It is possible to develop what is skillful. If it were not possible to develop what is skillful, I would not say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' But because it is possible to develop what is skillful, I say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' If this development of what is skillful were conducive to harm and pain, I would not say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' But because this development of what is skillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure, I say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.'"

 * I think my point was that video games become **more powerful** by virtue of their being **less open to interpretation**. I've not played Final Fantasy 10 (DAE think that is a ridiculous name. Like, 'Last of the Mohicans 2: Back with a vengeance!'). Is there a conscientious objector option or does one have to contort oneself into 'killer mode'?

* It wasn't an arbitrary statement/belief, sadly. I'm trying to help people. The lives that I will 'save' and the potential I will emancipate is worth my time. Of course it would be better if nothing had to be 'put down', that better world does not exist. Here in this world is suffering and dissipation. There are those things that lead to suffering and dissipation. And there are those who encourage, and those who discourage, those things that lead to suffering and dissipation. Often the opposite of dissipation leads to suffering. As often, and arguably more dangerous, is when the opposite of suffering leads to dissipation which then leads to increased suffering.

* Eminem has talent. I wonder what his 'Elegy for a Gamer' would sound like. Full of withering criticisms, no doubt! 




 *  I can't imagine anyone who wakes up in the morning and vows to devote themselves that day to the common good of all sentient beings

 There are people who do that. There are people who make the vow to do such a thing in a public ceremony. It is not uncommon in parts of the world.

* You are a 'moral relativist'. I am not. I am an 'enlightenment humanist' and, from the sounds of it, you are not. Our views of the world are incompatible.

* Hamlet may have said that but it is obvious he didn't believe it. 




 Was it the 'poverty of imagination' one?

May I ask that you not remove the comments of anyone who insults me. The insulting doesn't bother me, but the removal of potentially cogent content does. 




 I have played them and consider the time I spent on them time wasted. I do have acquaintances who play video games. I have noticed it having a detrimental effect on their 'lives'. A coldness, flabbiness, bareness characterised by grim companions and ethical indifference. 




 Poems can teach wisdom and represent beauty. Video games are more like sport without exercise. 

'When you pick up the controller something switches off in the heart.' 




 The 'I'd wager' prefix flags the conjectural basis of my comment. A conjecture not without reason however. I know, and have sources to prove, that commercial video games have been used to train killers in the past ([Marines being made to 'play' 'DOOM'](http://imgur.com/a/iImUQ#8WNhipK)), I can't think of any that have been made to instil caring into nurses or competence and compassion into doctors and surgeons. 




 Note my 'otherwise healthy' bit. 




 'Violence' and 'rampant capitalism' are 'life-skills'. I just don't think they're particularly noble ones.

 If it makes someone happy, how is that a bad thing?

You don't believe that such a thing as corruption exists?

 Reddit has a real-world application (research and propagandising, for example) which makes it disanalagous with video games. 




 What's your point? 




 How is what you choose to spend your time on morally superior to what a person who plays video games chooses?

Because I try to engage with things that are helpful, salubrious, or improving (- 'That makes better; spec. that improves the mind, understanding, or character; that makes agricultural improvements.) I believe that she who plays video games does not do so for reasons as noble as my motivators. 




 http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/action/#NatActAge

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personal-autonomy/

Are these helpful or would you rather something more basic? 









 I can't imagine anyone who wakes up in the morning and vows to devote themselves that day to the common good of all sentient beings would decide to spend the day playing board games in front of the television. 

Nonetheless, I will say a few words in their favour. Board games at least (usually?) require human contact so they have that going for them. 

With television, the consumption of the content can obtain with the agent's agency comparably intact. I am presented something, and then   I am beholden to no-one (not event the writer or director or leading lady) as to what opinions, and conclusions I have. I can 'make of it' what I like. With a video game I have to acquiesce with its creator to consume the content. Whatsoever she considers a door, I have to see as a door. Whatsoever she considers a task, I must consider a task. Whatsoever she considers the goal, I must assume as the goal. Whilst, one cannot 'fail' at 'The Godfather' (1972: Paramount Pictures) through being aghast at the characters' misdeeds, one could never possibly win at 'The Godfather: The Game' (2010: EA Games) without having to replicate (via your *avatar*) acts 'fearsome' and cruel.

An insect is capable of making the sort of decisions involved in Tetris. A human life wasted on such things is a sad thing however. If I was feeling poetic I'd say (after [Blake](http://www.poetryloverspage.com/poets/blake/to_see_world.html), of course)

      A Tetris brick that falls right down

      Touches the heartstrings without a sound. 




 * I am trying to say "it's so immoral you cannot justify using it". 

* Life has bigger, bolder, more pressing, and more puzzling puzzles than any video game. Ergo, those bigger, bolder, more pressing, and more puzzling puzzles will provide better braining training. 




 * The first article you quoted was awful. 

 So the fact that video game players are better at
'using a joystick and looking one way while reaching in a different direction' shows they are better at 'laparoscopic surgery'? I'm glad that no one actually believes that playing video games makes one a qualified surgeon. I'd wager that the surgeons who play video games would be worse surgeons than those that don't because they would take life less seriously and value human life less.

* 'Brain flexibility'? What kind of newspeak is this? I'd rather have a strong intellect, or a keen perception than a flexible brain. Quisling had a flexible brain. If I was a military general, I'd like recruits with 'flexible brains'. All the better to turn them from men to animals.

 And, surprise, surprise! Look who funded the study:

This research was supported by Air Force Office of Scientific Research (www.afosr.af.mil) grant FA9550-10-1-0268, Army Research Laboratory (www.arl.army.mil) grant

* I think the acid test to that would be if on your deathbed you wished you had played more video games. If you're telling me you believe you would, you have either my disbelief or my contempt and pity. 




 I think I also anticipated some of your thrust with my 'otherwise healthy' caveat in my explicatory comment above. 




 To state that one has the choice between 'seeking entertainment' and 'silently contemplating the mysteries of the universe' is a false dilemma and shows, if I might be so bold, a poverty of imagination.

Do I believe that with this precious human life, with so many different things to do, finding ways simply to 'pass the time' is a waste of time? Yes I do. The time will pass whatever we do. It is our responsibility to use it well. 




 * I have played, seen, and can name a video game.

* I am talking about the universe in which this 'morality system' takes place. If one were to 'save a tribe of villagers from a volcano' on a video game one would, on one level of consciousness, associate saving tribes of villagers from a volcano with what you did whilst playing that game. The necessary meaninglessness of the video game world (i.e. its video game-ness) has a toxic influence on a 'morality system' that has to exist in the world outside the game console, television and gamer ecology. The difference between saving a tribe of villagers and not saving a tribe of villagers on a video game has no effect on the number of lives lost (except perhaps that of the 'gamer', but that's an argument for elsewhere). The difference between saving a tribe of villagers and not saving a tribe of villagers - in real life - does have an effect that can be equated in terms of suffering caused and human lives lost. The 'morality system' cannot be equivalent or comparable between the two 'worlds'.

* 'Brutality beyond the minimum' is a phrase that has been forged by video games, I'm sure. I'll leave you to work out the irony. Correct me if I'm wrong.

* I don't think 'concomitantly' is a particularly difficult word. Let me know if you still don't understand what it means.

* It was George Lucas. His comments can be read here: http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/13/4427444/lucas-spielberg-storytelling-in-games-its-not-going-to-be-shakespeare-usc  




 In your examples the simulators are being used qua medicine/therapy not qua games. My argument is that in cases where they are 'merely games' they have no utility. 




 *All* video games. 




 In and of itself, no.

 **The Ladder of St. Augustine**

BY HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW

* * *
     
     
     Saint Augustine! well hast thou said,
     
      That of our vices we can frame

     A ladder, if we will but tread
     
      Beneath our feet each deed of shame!


     All common things, each day's events,
     
      That with the hour begin and end,

     Our pleasures and our discontents,
     
      Are rounds by which we may ascend.


     The low desire, the base design,
     
      That makes another's virtues less;

     The revel of the ruddy wine,
     
      And all occasions of excess;


     The longing for ignoble things;
     
      The strife for triumph more than truth;

     The hardening of the heart, that brings
     
      Irreverence for the dreams of youth;


     All thoughts of ill; all evil deeds,
     
      That have their root in thoughts of ill;

     Whatever hinders or impedes
     
      The action of the nobler will; 

     

     All these must first be trampled down
     
      Beneath our feet, if we would gain

     In the bright fields of fair renown
     
      The right of eminent domain.

     

     We have not wings, we cannot soar;
     
      But we have feet to scale and climb

     By slow degrees, by more and more,
     
      The cloudy summits of our time.

     

     The mighty pyramids of stone
     
      That wedge-like cleave the desert airs,

     When nearer seen, and better known,
     
      Are but gigantic flights of stairs.

     

     The distant mountains, that uprear
     
      Their solid bastions to the skies,

     Are crossed by pathways, that appear
     
      As we to higher levels rise.

     

     The heights by great men reached and kept
     
      Were not attained by sudden flight,

     But they, while their companions slept,
     
      Were toiling upward in the night.

     

     Standing on what too long we bore
     
      With shoulders bent and downcast eyes,

     We may discern  unseen before 
     
      A path to higher destinies,

     

     Nor doom the irrevocable Past
     
      As wholly wasted, wholly vain,

     If, rising on its wrecks, at last
     
      To something nobler we attain. 



















 **A GURU - WOULD I TRUST ONE? (Analytical Meditation)**

- Did I educate myself, who taught me the things I know? 


- Could I have learned to talk, read, write without relying on a teacher? 


- Could a sceptical 6-year old ever learn to read, without having a positive and open attitude? 


- Is it possible that other people know more than me? 


- Do trustworthy people exist at all? 


- What qualities would I expect of a real spiritual teacher? 


- Would I recognise a real spiritual teacher when I met one? 


- Would I like to have a spiritual teacher to make good progress or just to get rid of the responsibilities for my own life?

**Dumur**: How was the new edition of Nietzsche's Complete Philosophical Works established?

**Deleuze**: The problem was to reclassify the posthumous notesthe Nachlassin accordance with the dates Nietzsche had written them, and to place them after the works with which they were contemporaneous. Some of them had been used in an abusive way after Nietzsche's death to compose The Will to Power. So it was essential to reestablish the exact chronology. This explains why the first volume, The Gay Science, is more than half composed of previously unpublished fragments dating from 1881-1882. Our conception of Nietzsche's thought as well as his creative process may be profoundly altered as a result. The new edition will appear simultaneously in Italy, Germany, and France. But we owe the texts to the work of two Italians, Colli and Montinari.

**Dumur**: How do you explain that Italians rather than Germans did the job?

**Deleuze**: Maybe the Germans were not in a good position to do it. They already had numerous editions, which they were fond of, despite the arbitrary organization of the notes. Also, Nietzsche's manuscripts were in Weimar, East Germanywhere the Italians were better received than any West German could have hoped to be. Finally, the Germans were undoubtedly embarrassed at having accepted the edition of The Will to Power created by Nietzsche's sister. Elizabeth Forster-Nietzsche put together an extremely harmful work that privileges many Nazi interpretations. She didn't falsify the texts, but we know well enough that there are other ways to distort an author's thinking, even if it is merely an arbitrary selection from among his papers. Nietzschean concepts like those of "force" or "master" are complex enough to be betrayed by a selection such as hers.

**Dumur**: Will the translations be new?

**Deleuze**: Completely new. This is especially important for those writings toward the end (there have been some poor readings, for which Elizabeth Nietzsche and Peter Gast are responsible). The first two volumes to be published, The Gay Science and Human, All Too Human, have been translated by Pierre Klossowski and Robert Rovini. This doesn't mean that the prior translations by Henri Albert, and by Genevieve Bianquis, were badnot at all. But if they were determined to publish Nietzsche's notes with his works, they had to begin from scratch and unify the terminology. On that note, interestingly enough, Nietzsche was first introduced in France not by the "right," but by Charles Andler and Henri Albert, who represented a whole socialist tradition with anarchical colorings.

**Dumur**: Do you think a "return to Nietzsche" is taking place in France today? And if so, why is it?

**Deleuze**: It's difficult to say. Maybe there has been a change, or maybe the change is taking place now, with respect to the modes of thought which have been so familiar to us since the Liberation. We were used to thinking dialectically, historically. Today it seems the tide has turned from dialectical thinking toward structuralism, for example, as well as other systems of thought.

Foucault insists on the importance of the techniques of interpretation. It's possible that in the actual idea of interpretation is something which goes beyond the dialectical opposition between "knowing" and "transforming" the world. Freud is the great interpreter, so is Nietzsche, but in a different way. Nietzsche's idea is that things and actions are already interpretations. So to interpret is to interpret interpretations, and thus to change things, "to change life." What is clear for Nietzsche is that society cannot be an ultimate authority. The ultimate authority is creation, it is art: or rather, art represents the absence and the impossibility of an ultimate authority. From the very beginning of his work, Nietzsche posits that there exist ends "just a little higher" than those of the State, than those of society. He inserts his entire corpus in a dimension which is neither historical, even understood dialectically, nor eternal. What he calls this new dimension which operates both in time and against time is the untimely. It is in this that life as interpretation finds its source. Maybe the reason for the "return to Nietzsche" is a rediscovery of the untimely, that dimension which is distinct both from classical philosophy in its "timeless" enterprise and from dialectical philosophy in its understanding of history: a singular element of upheaval.

**Dumur**: Could we then say this is a return to individualism?

**Deleuze**: Yes, but a bizarre individualism, in which modern consciousness undoubtedly recognizes itself to some degree. Because in Nietzsche, this individualism is accompanied by a lively critique of the notions of "self" and "I." For Nietzsche there is a kind of dissolution of the self. The reaction against oppressive structures is no longer done, for him, in the name of a "self" or an "I." On the contrary, it is as though the "self" and the "I" were accomplices of those structures.

Must we say that the return to Nietzsche implies a kind of aestheticism, a renunciation of politics, an "individualism" as depersonalized as it is depoliticized? Maybe not. Politics, too, is in the business of interpretation. The untimely, which we just discussed, is never reducible to the political-historical element. But it happens from time to time that, at certain great moments, they coincide. When people die of hunger in India, such a disaster is political-historical. But when the people struggle for their liberation, there is always a coincidence of poetic acts and historical events or political actions, the glorious incarnation of something sublime or untimely. Such great coincidences are Nasser's burst of laughter when he nationalized Suez, or Castro's gestures, and that other burst of laughter, Giap's television interview. Here we have something that reminds us of Rimbaud's or Nietzsche's imperatives and which puts one over on Marxan artistic joy that comes to coincide with historical struggle. There are creators in politics, and creative movements, that are poised for a moment in history. Hitler, on the contrary, lacked to a singular degree any Nietzschean element. Hitler is not Zarathoustra. Nor is Trujillo. They represented what Nietzsche calls "the monkey of Zarathoustra." As Nietzsche said, if one wants to be "a master," it is not enough to come to power. More often than not it is the "slaves" who come to power, and who keep it, and who remain slaves while they keep it.

The masters according to Nietzsche are the untimely, those who create, who destroy in order to create, not to preserve. Nietzsche says that under the huge earth-shattering events are tiny silent events, which he likens to the creation of new worlds: there once again you see the presence of the poetic under the historical. In France, for instance, there are no earth-shattering events right now. They are far away, and horrible, in Vietnam. But we still have tiny imperceptible events, which maybe announce an exodus from today's desert. Maybe the return to Nietzsche is one of those "tiny events" and already a reinterpretation of the world.

     Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed 

    The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;

    But then begins a journey in my head 

    To work my mind, when bodys works expird:

    For then my thoughtsfrom far where I abide 

    Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee, 

    And keep my drooping eyelids open wide, 

    Looking on darkness which the blind do see: 

    Save that my souls imaginary sight 

    Presents thy shadow to my sightless view, 

    Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night, 

    Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.

    Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind, 

    For thee, and for myself no quiet find. 
 



















 At that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:

  Arise, arise, Riders of Thoden!

  Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!

  Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,

  A sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!

  Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

With that he seized a great horn from Guthlf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.

   Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. omer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first ored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Thoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as rome the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City. 



















 *"If you started in the wrong way," I said in answer to the investigator's questions, "everything that happened
would be a proof of the conspiracy against you. It would all be selfvalidating. You couldn't draw a breath
without knowing it was part of the plot."*

*"So you think you know where madness lies?"*

*My answer was a convinced and heartfelt, "Yes."*

*"And you couldn't control it?"*

*"No I couldn't control it. If one began with fear and hate as the major premise, one would have to go on the
conclusion."*

*"Would you be able," my wife asked, " to fix your attention on what The Tibetan Book of the Dead calls the
Clear Light?"*

*I was doubtful.*

*"Would it keep the evil away, if you could hold it? Or would you not be able to hold it?"*

*I considered the question for some time. "Perhaps," I answered at last, "perhaps I could  but only if there were
somebody there to tell me about the Clear Light. One couldn't do it by oneself. That's the point, I suppose, of the
Tibetan ritual  somebody sitting there all the time and telling you what's what."*

[Aldous Huxley, 'Doors of Perception', 5758]


**I. General Introduction**


A psychedelic experience is a journey to new realms of consciousness. The scope and content of the experience
is limitless, but its characteristic features are the transcendence of verbal concepts, of spacetime dimensions,
and of the ego or identity. Such experiences of enlarged consciousness can occur in a variety of ways: sensory
deprivation, yoga exercises, disciplined meditation, religious or aesthetic ecstasies, or spontaneously. Most
recently they have become available to anyone through the ingestion of psychedelic drugs such as LSD,
psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, etc. [This is the statement of an ideal, not an actual situation, in 1964. The
psychedelic drugs are in the United States classified as "experimental" drugs. That is, they are not available on a
prescription basis, but only to "qualified investigators." The Federal Food and Drug Administration has defined
"qualified investigators" to mean psychiatrists working in a mental hospital setting, whose research is sponsored
by either state or federal agencies.]

Of course, the drug dose does not produce the transcendent experience. It merely acts as a chemical key  it
opens the mind, frees the nervous system of its ordinary patterns and structures. The nature of the experience
depends almost entirely on set and setting. Set denotes the preparation of the individual, including his
personality structure and his mood at the time. Setting is physical  the weather, the room's atmosphere; social 
feelings of persons present towards one another; and cultural  prevailing views as to what is real. It is for this
reason that manuals or guidebooks are necessary. Their purpose is to enable a person to understand the new
realities of the expanded consciousness, to serve as road maps for new interior territories which modern science
has made accessible.

Different explorers draw different maps. Other manuals are to be written based on different models  scientific,
aesthetic, therapeutic. The Tibetan model, on which this manual is based, is designed to teach the person to
direct and control awareness in such a way as to reach that level of understanding variously called liberation,
illumination, or enlightenment. If the manual is read several times before a session is attempted, and if a trusted
person is there to remind and refresh the memory of the voyager during the experience, the consciousness will
be freed from the games which comprise "personality" and from positivenegative hallucinations which often
accompany states of expanded awareness. The Tibetan Book of the Dead was called in its own language the
Bardo Thodol, which means "Liberation by Hearing on the AfterDeath Plane." The book stresses over and over
that the free consciousness has only to hear and remember the teachings in order to be liberated.

The Tibetan Book of the Dead is ostensibly a book describing the experiences to be expected at the moment of
death, during an intermediate phase lasting fortynine (seven times seven) days, and during rebirth into another
bodily frame. This however is merely the exoteric framework which the Tibetan Buddhists used to cloak their
mystical teachings. The language and symbolism of death rituals of Bonism, the traditional preBuddhist
Tibetan religion, were skillfully blended with Buddhist conceptions. The esoteric meaning, as it has been
interpreted in this manual, is that it is death and rebirth that is described, not of the body. Lama Govinda
indicates this clearly in his introduction when he writes: "It is a book for the living as well as the dying." The
book's esoteric meaning is often concealed beneath many layers of symbolism. It was not intended for general
reading. It was designed to be understood only by one who was to be initiated personally by a guru into the
Buddhist mystical doctrines, into the premortemdeath rebirth experience. These doctrines have been kept a
closely guarded secret for many centuries, for fear that naive or careless application would do harm. In
translating such an esoteric text, therefore, there are two steps: one, the rendering of the original text into
English; and two, the practical interpretation of the text for its uses. In publishing this practical interpretation for
use in the psychedelic drug session, we are in a sense breaking with the tradition of secrecy and thus
contravening the teachings of the lamagurus.

However, this step is justified on the grounds that the manual will not be understood by anyone who has not had
a consciousnessexpanding experience and that there are signs that the lamas themselves, after their recent
diaspora, wish to make their teachings available to a wider public. 




      Joyful to have
     Such a human birth,
     Difficult to find,
     Free and well-favored.	

     But death is real,
     Comes without warning.
     This body
     Will be a corpse.

     Unalterable
     Are the laws of karma;
     Cause and effect
     Cannot be escaped.	

     Samsara
     Is an ocean of suffering,
     Unendurable,
     Unbearably intense.

 Talking about ethics is seen by some as rather old-fashioned, (Note however my use of the word 'highly' in the title of this post), but I would assert that some games are more ethical than others. I also think that a game can be a good game and be bad and a bad game can be good. Make of that what you will.

 Never having played it I'm not able to comment with certainty. Personally,  if I'm being honest with myself, the 'indirect good' I've experienced from playing video games is quite limited indeed. 




 It's a matter of opinion. I'd say the above games are ethical on account of the good that they do over and above passing the time and entertaining.

 Very mandala like. 









 Perhaps. There's a big difference between 'putting an end to fracking in its entirety' and not starting it where it has hitherto been illegal, however. 




 Every social society involves some form of agreement to treat your fellow members well

I don't think so. Such an agreement is certainly more explicit in Freemasonry than other groups.

 taking an oath to provide assistance to members of a group makes you incapable of acting rationally

That's not what I'm saying. Partiality and irrationality are not identical terms. 

 if you abuse the public trust, then you aren't acting as a Mason.

So long as that credo is at the forefront of their mind then good on them. When that is ignored society as a whole suffers. 

If it is the case that justice is not perverted through the existence of Freemason cabals, then I retract my insinuations to the contrary. The way things are, however, I will be offering no such retraction. 




 We can't just freeze and starve to death until someone comes up with a hydrogen car and replaces our source of the majority of our electricity. The current demand must be met, or our entire infrastructure would collapse.

You're putting the cart before the horse. If the demand and will for clean energy is there then the economy and energy industry can reorientate accordingly. The German government intends to garner 60% of energy from renewables by 2050. Other nations should follow suit. For the United Kingdom to lift its ban on fracking at this moment in time is a misstep that could have dire consequences both actually and qua gesture politics. 




 It's also the whole 'burning fossil fuels thing'. We should be looking for fewer ways to pollute the atmosphere not more. 




 The Freemason tenets of 'brotherly love' and 'relief' aren't negative in and of themselves but they become so when it enters into a sphere where equality before the law and [the principle of equal opportunities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity) should remain paramount.

    Though absent long,	

These forms of beauty have not been to me,	

As is a landscape to a blind man's eye:	

But oft, in lonely rooms, and mid the din	

Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,	

In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,	

Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart,	

And passing even into my purer mind	

With tranquil restoration:feelings too	

Of unremembered pleasure; such, perhaps,	

As may have had no trivial influence	

**On that best portion of a good man's life;**

**His little, nameless, unremembered acts**	

**Of kindness and of love.** Nor less, I trust,	

To them I may have owed another gift,	

Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,	

In which the burthen of the mystery,	

In which the heavy and the weary weight	

Of all this unintelligible world	

Is lighten'd:that serene and blessed mood,	

In which the affections gently lead us on,	

Until, the breath of this corporeal frame,	

And even the motion of our human blood	

Almost suspended, we are laid asleep	

In body, and become a living soul:	

While with an eye made quiet by the power	

Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,	

We see into the life of things.

 And WW2 was caused by jingoistic horseshit. But not based on. 




  Civil War deaths are based on incomplete returns

Does this mean a deserter would count as a death? I could imagine the sons and grandsons of the pioneers would have been rather prone to upping sticks and starting life anew on the hoof. Perhaps the number of 'recorded deaths' is a grossly inflated figure. 














 'Naga' is sometimes used to mean 'elephant' or a generic, large, fearsome monster, too. 














 Helpful comment. I studied this at school but was never presented with that information in such a clear way. Of course, it's a very complicated subject. One could dedicate one's life work to working it out and you could still have much to learn. I regret the charged manner in which I headed the picture. Arguably redeemed somewhat by your post. I'm sure an equally lucid case for the other side could be made. Terrible business all told. As an Englishman one can't help feel things were largely the fault of the British. Oh well....

 Does it? Also, saying how I 'differentiate video games from other forms of entertainment' wouldn't be required to make a valid and sound argument that video games are a waste of time. 




 Or maybe it was thinker or writer. I think he mentioned a desert at some point too.

for decreased empathy and prosocial behavior.

 What are some activities that you think are more useful than playing video games? 




 Nope. It was non-fiction. 




 I touch on that in the CMV thread. John Stuart Mill expresses some of my thoughts in chapter two of Utilitarianism - the section containing the famous statement about it being 'better to be Socrates unsatisfied than a pig satisfied'. I also touch on that which makes relationship between the consumer and creator of games different to the creator/consumer relationship in music and movies. In short, games require a greater acquiescence and obeisance from the consumer towards the creator than other media. Additionally, the active participation of the gamer as an agent within the game is a cause of harm. The artificiality creates anomie, through the toxic effect of the necessarily meaningless and unimportant game-world, whereas the mimesis with the real world encourages immorality/immoralism through conditioning (e.g. encouraging violence). 

I also imply, in an aside, that games bring out the bad of competitive sport (brutishness, ruthlessness, and tribalism/egoism, etc. etc. ) with none of the benefits - e.g. exercise.  




 A discussion of my statements, and my (partial) recantation can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/26gjxf/cmv_i_believe_that_playing_video_games_is_morally/ 




 I believe that playing video games is a waste of time and a corrupting influence on an otherwise healthy human being. My first objection to video games is founded on the belief that they do nothing good. My second objection is that they do something bad. [edit for /r/philsophy: Moreover, I believe that playing video games is morally indefensible.]

I cannot think of any good that video games do. Where things that resemble video games have a practical implementation they are not called 'video games'. A pilot learning on a flight stimulator has an equivalence to an air traffic controller monitoring a graphic of in-air flights. Neither is playing a game because neither is using a tool that has real-world importance. Whereas a 'video game' is a trivial enterprise, ('game'), in a dimension that doesn't truly exist. The 'video' is just electronic pixels producing an illusion. Existence pertains to that universe that we live in. That of time, space, feeling, and suffering.

The 'unreal world' setting of video games leads to the conditions arising that result in their real-world harm. Whilst I can imagine a game developer with the best intentions trying to create a game which tries to instil good character traits in the 'gamer', I believe her attempt would be fruitless. Any encouragement of positive characteristics would necessarily be concomitant with a diminution and tainting of the 'real world' through association with the 'unreal world'. This leads to apathy and alienation.
Furthermore, if the game developer doesn't approach the project of making a game with the best of intentions then the game will inevitably enforce or reinforce bad character traits. A game that is made with disregard to encouraging moral virtues will lead to a game that encourages immorality (or amorality - as covered above). I believe that this has happened and is happening. It is well illustrated by these comments made by a leading creative

"Hardcore gamers basically love to watch the baby hit the floor. They said I want a game where I can shoot somebody in the head and blow their head off, so the gaming industry moved in that direction. So thats what theyre doing. And you cant empathize with somebody youre going to kill, so that whole idea has gone out the window."

(Games that encourage a ruthless, competitive win-at-all-costs mentality are equally guilty in their ability to clip the 'Angel's wings' that is human potential).


I believe that video games are good for nothing more than as a good example of how to waste time and corrupt. (And that there are better ways to learn such lessons!)

 OK. 




 Is there such a thing as an unwounded soldier? 




 Thus was Mr. Pickwick brought face to face with the difficulty of seeing his own counsel.  He could not understand why, having retained the services of a professional man and paid for them, there should exist any impediment to prevent access to him.  I wont discuss to-night the advisability or non-advisability of dividing the profession of the law into two parts, but I do say that any system which prevents litigants having the fullest personal communication with those they have paid to represent them is an anomaly and an absurdity.

But Mr. Pickwick was a person of determination, and he did see Serjeant Snubbin, and he delivered to that learned gentleman a short address that was well worthy of his attention, as it is of every member of the Bar, including your very humble servant.

Gentlemen of your profession, sir, continued Mr. Pickwick, see the worst side of human nature.  All its disputes, all its ill-will and bad blood, rise up before you.  You know from your experience of juries (I mean no disparagement to you, or them) how much depends upon effect; and you are apt to attribute to others a desire to use, for purposes of deception and self-interest, the very instruments which you, in pure honesty and honour of purpose, and with a laudable desire to do your utmost for your client, know the temper and worth of so well, from constantly employing them yourselves.  I really believe that to this circumstance may be attributed the vulgar but very general notion of your being, as a body, suspicious, distrustful, and overcautious.  Conscious as I am, sir, of the disadvantage of making such a declaration to you, under such circumstances, I have come here, because I wish you distinctly to understand, as my friend Mr. Perker has said, that I am innocent of the falsehood laid to my charge; and although I am very well aware of the inestimable value of your assistance, sir, I must beg to add that, unless you sincerely believe this, I would rather be deprived of the aid of your talents than have the advantage of them.

 Some good and bad arguments either way. See if you can add to them. 









 [In 1904, Elizabeth "Lizzie" Magie designed a board game to demonstrate the tragic effects of land-grabbing. In this game, oligarchs enrich themselves at the expense of tenants, the latter of whom only grow poorer as available land decreases and the cost of rent increases. Anyone interested in traveling a non-trivial distance has to pony up for a railroad ticket. Anyone desiring light and water had better open their wallet. And crossing the wrong landowner sends a player directly to jail. The poorer the proletarian player gets, the more he or she is squeezed; there is nowhere to go that doesnt demand a fee of some kind, and there is no respite. The game ends only when everyone is driven penniless into the ground, but for a single aristocrat who now owns everything. Lizzie Magie named her grim reflection of life The Landlords Game, but you probably know it better as Monopoly.](http://mentalfloss.com/article/48787/retrobituaries-elizabeth-lizzie-magie-inventor-monopoly)

 Why?  









 Last time I got a BSOD I got a few in quick succession. I deleted recently downloaded software and it went away so I think it was definitely that then. That made me think it was that reason this time too. I've had a disconcerting rattling from my laptop recently so it's probably/possibly linked to that and not software after all. 




 It was your tone as much as anything. The Buddha was said to have combined intelligence with love. This is an advanced practise - one requiring speed and deliberation, precision and equanimity, strength and tenderness. It has been said that 'hatred is the near enemy of intelligence'. Can you understand how that might be the case? 




 I have 'delta'd' someone who, to my mind, managed to deserve it. One's man's argument is another's debate. Whilst I was curter than I would have liked to have been as a result of needing to keep up with the oncoming traffic and not neglect anyone (that is until this thread was censored and civilisation's progress impeded in the process), I believe I have helped expose some 'home truths' to those who would otherwise not have heard it through the moans of enablers, nor smelt it through the fetid miasma of their own inertia and self-deceit and have learnt one or two things myself about the brave, unheralded labours of some of my fellow men and women of science who are attempting to redeem video games.

I will only change to improve! Semper fidelis!  




  #8710;

Sadly ~~one of~~ the mods ~~(_____)~~ has deleted this thread so people won't get to see your helpful post. Which is a shame because it might have stopped less people dying from horrible, currently incurable diseases in the future. Because of ~~_____'s~~ actions (which I believe are the result of being 'butthurt' over having her 'holy-cow' of video games openly disparaged) many more people may die long, slow painful deaths than would have otherwise.

I must emphasise however that I am giving you the Changer's Cap for your help sciencey game links - they could (potentially) be useful whilst still being little more than a numbing (nay, infantilising) pastime for the player (as is common to all video games) - and not your last two points.

Your spouse point is not a good one. They will become each other's [enablers](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=enabler) and probably(/possibly?) bring disappointment to their friends and relatives.

As for playing Lego, St. Paul said it well when he said 'When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.'

 ...Alienation and reification are the two ideas most commonly
associated with critical theory. The former is usually identified
with the psychological effects of exploitation and the division of
labor, and the latter with how people are treated instrumentally, as
things, through concepts that have been ripped from their
historical context. Pioneering studies of alienation and reification
had already been undertaken by Western Marxists during the
1920s, but the Frankfurt School provided a unique sense of how
these complex categories impacted upon individuals in advanced
industrial society.

They investigated the ways in which thinking was being reduced
to mechanical notions of what is operative and profitable, ethical
reflection was tending to vanish, and aesthetic enjoyment was
becoming more standardized. Critical theorists noted with alarm
how interpreting modern society was becoming ever more
difficult. Alienation and reification were thus analyzed in terms of
how they imperiled the exercise of subjectivity, robbed the world
of meaning and purpose, and turned the individual into a cog in
the machine.

Auschwitz was seen as incarnating the most radical implications
of alienation and reification. It was the watershed event that
shattered optimistic assumptions about progress even more
radically than the Lisbon earthquake did during the eighteenth
century. With images of the Nazi concentration camps still fresh,
Hiroshima and Nagasaki destroyed, new reports emerging about
the Soviet Gulag, and McCarthyism on the rise in the United
States, it appeared to the Frankfurt School as if Western
civilization had generated not human development but an
unparalleled barbarism. They knew that something more was
required from radical thought than the usual stale critique of
capitalism....

 Dear Leo,

I still await with palpitating eagerness the 18-page letter that you have promised me. I imagine that it will be something in the nature of an epica soul-exposing, world-defying human documentand I am asking in advance for the publication rights in Boston. Upon receiving your MS I will Fanny Butcher it something like this:

"Leo Adams, a small town boy who made good in Chicago and went to New York to let his hair down has just aroused the interest (to say nothing of the passions) of his contemporaries with one of the boldest American literary efforts since Eddie Guest he could write poetry. His story will live in the anals of literature.

"Working with a modern metre, a Washington Square setting and a limited vocabulary, he carries us back to the daze of Greece when Socrates went blind with passion at the sight of the limbs of a youth and when all a young boy had to do to be successful was to get under a good man and work his way up.

"Though sadly hampered by the English language's notorious lack of synonyms for the capital "I", Mr. Adams reinforces his style with the sincerity of his belief in himself and savors it with a sensuality so austere that one is led to believe that he himself is more staid than stayed with.

"His purple interludes are at once reminiscent of Oscar Wilde and Frank Harris. He is not, of course as Wilde as Oscar but neither is he, on the other hand, as Frank as Harris, though if sufficiently Harrised he might go Wilde.

"If left alone, this young man will go far but we doubt if he will find his way back."

He was in the fields, when I came back.

In between, what long hours,

What centuries might have elapsed.

Did he look up? His arm half

Lifted was more to ward off

My foolishness. You will return,

He intimated; the heart's roots

Are here under this black soil

I labour at. A change of wind

Can bring the smooth town to a stop;

The grass whispers beneath the flags;

Every right word on your tongue

Has a green taste. It is the mind

Calling you, eager to paint

Its distances; but the truth's here,

Closer than the world will confess,

In this bare bone of life that I pick.

To cars going the other way we were a quick loud noise, a flash; seen from aboveeven a crop duster would have given you the perspectivewe were nothing like thatnot loud, not powerful, not affecting much at all, not leaving any ruin, not making any noisewe were just some little black thing puttering straight on the straight road, producing only the smallest buzzing sound, crawling through this flat, terrible grid.

 The ensuing morning brought reflection with it, as morning usually does; but widely different was the train of thought it awakened in the different persons who had been so unexpectedly brought together on the preceding evening...

The reflections of Sir Mulberry Hawkif such a term can be applied to the thoughts of the systematic and calculating man of dissipation, whose joys, regrets, pains, and pleasures, are all of self, and who would seem to retain nothing of the intellectual faculty but the power to debase himself, and to degrade the very nature whose outward semblance he wearsthe reflections of Sir Mulberry Hawk turned upon Kate Nickleby, and were, in brief, that she was undoubtedly handsome; that her coyness MUST be easily conquerable by a man of his address and experience, and that the pursuit was one which could not fail to redound to his credit, and greatly to enhance his reputation with the world. And lest this last considerationno mean or secondary one with Sir Mulberryshould sound strangely in the ears of some, let it be remembered that most men live in a world of their own, and that in that limited circle alone are they ambitious for distinction and applause. Sir Mulberry's world was peopled with profligates, and he acted accordingly.

Thus, cases of injustice, and oppression, and tyranny, and the most extravagant bigotry, are in constant occurrence among us every day. It is the custom to trumpet forth much wonder and astonishment at the chief actors therein setting at defiance so completely the opinion of the world; but there is no greater fallacy; it is precisely because they do consult the opinion of their own little world that such things take place at all, and strike the great world dumb with amazement.

 Provision of mental health services for young people varies widely across England, with entry-level care largely funded by local authorities, which are trying to slash spending.


Research has found young people who do not receive help in the early stages of their illness can suffer serious consequences, often needing time in hospital or remaining ill during adulthood.

Young Minds submitted a Freedom of Information request about funding of child and adolescent mental health services for 2014-15 and the previous four financial years.

It had responses from 99 out of the 151 councils it contacted.

More than half had made cuts over the last five years, while nine councils had kept funding at the same level.

The biggest reduction was at Birmingham City Council, from just above 2.3m in 2010-11 to 125,000 in 2014-15, a drop of 94%

 Very useful. Some stuff on there I'd not come across before - or certainly not in such a succinct form.

I'd translate it as 'experiencing happiness in the happiness of others'. A lot of the Sanskrit and Pali origins are well worth checking out further.

Seeing the delight of others in this cheat sheet is a good opportunity to bask in some mudita, mind. :)

 1941 




 Remember the fuss about a Danish cartoon depicting the prophet Muhammad? I still think the anger of some Muslims silly. But inexplicable? Ive had to think again.

[...]Dorothy L Sayers [was suggested as a topic] for my Radio 4 series 'Great Lives'. Sayers, a committed Anglican, wrote a cycle of plays about Jesus, 'The Man Born to be King', which the BBC broadcast in the 1940s. There was outrage. Heres the Lords Day Observance Society, whose formal complaint to the BBC spoke  believe it or not  for many conservative Christians:

Christian people have been shocked at the announcement of the proposed impersonation of our Lord Jesus Christ in a Sunday Play on the wireless . . . the first time a radio impersonation of Christ has been attempted anywhere in the world . . . bordering on the blasphemous . . . a contemplated violation of the Third Commandment which forbids taking the Name of God in vain.

That was little more than 70 years ago. Today we would struggle to understand how there could even have been an issue. Listen now and the only thing that might surprise you is how posh theyve made Jesus: He sounds like a Conservative MP.

Piya Tan glosses it along the lines of 'don't turn the Buddhist teachings/way of life into a commercial enterprise'.

I think it could be understood to have a metaphysical as well as an ethical dimension. The Dharma should be its own reward. You don't follow the Dharma to receive something other than the Dharma; you act according to the Dharma and consequently it is the Dharma you receive. 

A banana trader would expect to receive, say, money for his bananas. A devotee of the Buddha who expects to trade the Dharma for money in a similar fashion would be acting wrong-headedly.

 *L'esprit de l'escalier* literally translates as 'the spirit of the stairs'. The saying evokes passing someone on a flight of stairs and wanting to have said something but only thinking of it a few moments too late as, say, you have gone up and they have gone down. One only realises the best thing to say after more time spent thinking (conscious rumination or subconscious gestation). I was punning on 'stairs'. Both stairs, and 'reflection and doing nothing' elevate one.

Edit: I remember now that the pun worked on another level too: *l'espirit d'escalier* is the key to going deeper. Typical *l'esprit d'escalier* - remembering to add this now! 




 I know that's how it's used. I was deliberately being more expansive.

 Good to hear. 




 Specifically referring to allegations of torture:

**The Winter Soldier Investigation**

In Detroit in 1971, several soldiers described incidents of torture, though they
refused to name the soldiers who had tortured.^51 ... They gave their own names and
presented their discharge papers, identifying when and where they had served,
and they detailed when and where torture occurred. The soldiers at Winter
Soldier did not describe bizarre tortures never reported elsewhere, as in other
accounts, and at least as far as torture is concerned, there is nothing here to
make one question Senator Mark Hatfields decision to read this account into
the Congressional Record in 1971....

Steve Noetzel offers the earliest account of American telephone torture,
situating it in the Mekong Delta region between 1963 and 1964.^52 Soldiers who
served in the mid-1960s repeatedly mention telephone torture and less commonly
beating. There are two accounts describing the use of dogs in torture
and singular accounts of suspension, water torture, and ear boring.^53 One soldier
describes an incident of field interrogation using knives in which the prisoner
was killed because the medics would have become suspicious.^54

Don Dzagulones, a former military interrogator, gave the most detailed
account of interrogation and torture. Dzagulones described field telephone torture
as well as dehydration, which left nothing that was traceable.^55 As in
other testimonials, Dzagulones does not mention official training for torture.
Rather, he describes how commanders in Vietnam exercised benign neglect
(If people did find out about it, they just let it go, because it was an accepted
practice). He also describes how he learned techniques... after the official instructors turned the class over to Vietnam
veterans (invariably the instruction would turn to various methods that
theyd seen or heard or used in torturing people in Vietnam).^56 ...

Let me turn now to the criticisms of Winter Soldier. Guenter Lewy has
sharply questioned the accounts soldiers provided. In particular, he sharply criticized
the unwillingness of soldiers to name those who committed war crimes,
arguing that in American jurisprudence, guilt is always personal. Lewy also
summarized the results of the investigation of the Winter Soldier allegations by
the Naval Investigative Service. The most damaging finding consisted of the
sworn statements of several veterans, corroborated by witnesses, that they had
in fact not attended the hearing in Detroit. One of them had never been in
Detroit all his life. He did not know, he stated, who might have used his name.
The report also identifies another soldier, an African-American, who asserted
that a member of the Nation of Islam helped him prepare his testimony.^59

But the appearance of exactitude here is deceptive. Unlike other critics,
such as Sheehan and Moyar, who have exposed fabricators by name using unclassified
military files, Lewy does not give the names of the fake speakers at
Winter Soldier, and guilt, as he so correctly states, is an individual matter. Collective
sin belongs to theology, not history, and it is a mistake to tar everyone
at Winter Soldier with the faults of specific individuals. In 2004, Lewy was no
longer certain whether he saw the file that described these allegations. In an
interview with the Baltimore Sun, Lewy states that he does not recall if he saw
a copy of the naval investigative report or was briefed on its contents.^60 The
cursory bibliographic information, which offers neither the date of the investigation
nor a reference number, suggests he never saw it.


Efforts to find this file have thus far failed. The Suns reporters were not
able to secure it, and Paul ODonnell, the spokesman for the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service, reported that they were searching for a copy of the report.
^61 In addition, a military librarian with access to classified databases was
unable to find the file listed in any database. Perhaps one day a FOIA request
will recover this file and two other files Lewy cites.

The lack of names, the probable oral character of the summary, and the
absence of the hard copy raise troubling questions about Lewys allegations.
Furthermore, during the 2004 presidential campaign, conservative groups put
a great deal of energy into finding anyone who would discredit the Winter
Soldier investigations. If, as Lewy insists, there were veterans who were outraged
that someone used their name falsely to make claims of atrocities in Vietnam,
this was the time for them to have come forward. But by the end of fall 2004,
only one soldier came forward, Steven J. Pitkin.^62 If Pitkins account is true,
it does not fit the allegations in the NIS file. Pitkin does not state someone
impersonated him at Winter Soldier; rather he retracts the account he offered
there. So where were the several soldiers whose were so outrageously impersonated
at Winter Soldier? And where was the African American who had received
help from the Nation of Islam in preparing his testimony?


There are also troubling questions about the Pitkin affidavit. Pitkin apparently
filed his affidavit twice. His first affidavit was filed on August 31, 2004,
and it was immediately contested. Another veteran, Scott Camil, filed his own
affidavit on September 11, 2004, pointing to falsehoods in the Pitkin affidavit.^63
Pitkin subsequently filed a new affidavit on September 15, 2004. This new affidavit
was surprising in its own right since his close friend from the 1970s, Nancy
Miller Saunders, believed he was dead.^64 At any rate, Pitkins new affidavit states
that he falsely described incidents of rape, brutality, atrocities and racism at
the urging of presidential candidate John Kerry.^65 This is problematic for another
reason: Pitkins statement at Winter Soldier does not describe incidents
of rape, brutality, or other atrocities. Pitkin speaks thrice in the transcripts of
Winter Soldier. The first and longest testimony is a generic statement about
the dehumanization caused by war. Here, Pitkin uses the word atrocity to describe
U.S. press coverage and his army training stateside, but not to describe
specific incidents of violence in Vietnam...


One last fact raises questions about the political motivation behind the
affidavit. Pitkin is the easiest veteran to associate with John Kerry at Winter
Soldier because he is the only one to appear with him on film. It is thought provoking
that given all the soldiers Lewy claims were impersonated at Winter
Soldier, only and especially Pitkin came forward to denounce it.


At the moment, then, Pitkins affidavit seems unreliable and Lewys claims
about Winter Soldier are as nearly hearsay as the ones he is criticizing. Recently,
a group of anti-Kerry veterans have received and made available some
21,477 pages of FBI documents on the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.^67
Perhaps in time, the lost file or FBI files similar to it will appear, allowing one
to identify the liars. But the continued absence of the Naval Investigative File
suggests that Lewys contact deliberately misled him and Lewy mistakenly
found the contact convincing.


Two other features of Lewys discussion of torture are also troubling, suggesting
that his assessment of American torture in Vietnam is less than evenhanded.
Despite his criticism of testimonials about American torture in South
Vietnam, Lewy is quick to accept testimonial literature when it pertains to
Communist torture. Unable to show North Vietnamese government documents
authorizing torture, he argues nevertheless that the uniformity in the
testimonial literature suggests that torture was government policy. Lewy faults
gullible antiwar criticism, arguing that they should have known the North Vietnamese
would torture given past testimonials about Communist practice during
the Korean and Franco-Vietnamese wars.^68

This is the standard application of the Nuremberg rule of course: uniformity
of practice indicates uniformity of intent. Indeed, there are important continuities
in Communist torture practices, although the testimonial literature
also indicates significant variations during the Vietnamese and Korean conflicts,
as I document in chapters 3 and 17. Lewy is right to criticize the antiwar
critics on this point. By the same token, however, the French tortured in Vietnam
as did the South Vietnamese, and the uniform pattern for the latter also
strongly suggested that the South Vietnamese had an official torture policy too.
Lewy mentions South Vietnamese torture in one sentence, stating only that the
ARVN was known for their bad treatment and torture of captured VC. Lewy
does not even mention French torture during the Vietnamese conflict.^69

It seems odd that Lewy applies one set of rules for acceptable evidence and
interpretation for Communist torture and quite another for American torture.
Lewy is correct that retrospective testimony about the past is highly problematic,
but so too is proximate testimony. Proximity to the incident may occlude
judgment and perspective, and the real situation may become more apparent
with time. General Massu believed that torture was effective and necessary at
the time he acted in Algeria, but came, correctly, to the opposite conclusion
thirty years later. Does this mean his later testimony is false or unreliable? Again,
it is rather surprising that Lewy does not even mention this possibility, seeking
to rule out all retrospective testimonial literature in principle when it comes to
American veterans testimonies of torture.^70 ... 

Ultimately though,
the testimonial evidence does not disagree too much with the position Lewy
wants to defend, namely, that torture was not official government policy issued
from Washington, DC. The testimonial evidence describes instead a local,
semiofficial policy that existed for all the reasons Lewy outlines.

From *Torture and Democracy* (2007) by Darius Rejali 




 I googled a name at random off that CID document. He still upheld his testimony in an interview in 2010. 

More convincingly, the book *Torture and Democracy* by Darius Rejali contains the following passage in the Appendix - 'A Note on Sources for American Torture during
the Vietnam War':

Furthermore, during the 2004 presidential campaign, conservative groups put
a great deal of energy into finding anyone who would discredit the Winter
Soldier investigations. If, as Lewy insists, there were veterans who were outraged
that someone used their name falsely to make claims of atrocities in Vietnam,
this was the time for them to have come forward. But by the end of fall 2004,
only one soldier came forward, Steven J. Pitkin.^62 If Pitkins account is true,
it does not fit the allegations in the NIS file. Pitkin does not state someone
impersonated him at Winter Soldier; rather he retracts the account he offered
there. So where were the several soldiers whose were so outrageously impersonated
at Winter Soldier? And where was the African American who had received
help from the Nation of Islam in preparing his testimony?

 **1 January, 1839**. Talked of my getting on in Oliver Twist; of the descriptions
of squalid vice in it; of the accounts of starvation in the Workhouses and
Schools, Mr. Dickens gives in his books. Lord M[elbourne - the Prime Minister] says, in many schools they
give children the worst things to eat, and bad beer, to save expense; told him
Mamma admonished me for reading light books.

**Sunday, 7th April 1839.** Lord M. was talking of some dish or other, and
alluded to something in Oliver Twist; he read half of the 1st vol. at Panshanger.
Its all among Workhouses, and Coffin Makers, and Pickpockets, he said; I
dont like that low debasing style; its all slang; its just like The Beggars Opera;
I shouldnt think it would tend to raise morals; I dont like that low debasing
view of mankind. We defended Oliver very much, but in vain. I dont like
those things; I wish to avoid them; I dont like them in reality, and therefore
I dont wish to see them represented, he continued; that everything one read
should be pure and elevating. Schiller and Goethe would have been shocked
at such things, he said. Lehzen said they would not have disliked reading
them. She dont know her own literature, said Lord M., for that Goethe
said one ought never to see anything disagreeable; he wouldnt look upon
the dead; and thats just the same thing. Its a bad taste, he continued,
which will pass away like any other, but depend upon it, while it lasts its a
bad, depraved, vicious taste; now just read Jonathan Wild, he said to Lord
Torrington, and Amelia, and see if it isnt just the same thing.

 How are you working that out? 









 http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article4246289.ece 




 **Keep clocks forward to boost health, say experts**

Permanently moving the time zone forward an hour would encourage children to do more exercise, according to a study that has revived calls for Britain to ditch Greenwich Mean Time.
MPs, scientists and charities argue that putting the country on central European time would have significant benefits for public health, road safety and the economy.

The main proposal is for Britain to have the clocks two hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time in summer and one hour ahead in winter, giving people more light at the end of the day throughout the year and effectively placing the country in the same time zone as France and Germany.

The idea, known as Single/Double Summer Time, would give people about 200 extra waking hours of daylight each year. It has broad support among backbench MPs.

Rebecca Harris, the Conservative MP whose private members bill for a review of Britains time zone was defeated by a filibuster in 2012, said that there was a strong case for bringing new legislation after the general election in May. Its certainly possible that perhaps in the next parliament it might be picked up, but there are already campaigns around the country trying to get it into various political party manifestos, she said.

When my bill was going through the Commons it had considerable cross-party support. The big health benefit was seen as being having an extra hour of daylight in the evening when children and adults are more able to make use of it for extra recreation and being outdoors.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative backbencher who helped to filibuster the bill, said: That we tried it before and reversed it [between 1968 and 1971] and Portugal did the same indicates that people do not like long, dark mornings. Essentially, there is not enough daylight in the winter and muddling with the clocks wont create any more.
Scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Bristol found that children in nine countries got more exercise when sunset was later.

Shifting Britains time zone to match other western European 
countries would lead children to do two minutes more exercise each day on average  an increase of 6 per cent, they said.
Anna Goodman, the lead author of the research, which appeared in the International Journal of Behavioural Nutrition and Physical Activity, said:Introducing additional daylight savings measures would affect every child in the country, every day of the year, giving it a far greater reach than most other potential policy initiatives to improve public health.

Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, said that the idea should also be revisited for its environmental benefits.

A separate study published today suggests that seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a form of depression that affects sufferers acutely during the winter, may be more widespread than thought.

In a YouGov survey of 2,000 people, 8 per cent said that they had clinical SAD, while a further 21 per cent said that they suffered from the condition to a lesser degree. Previous studies have put the level at between 3 and 4 per cent. In all, 57 per cent said that their mood tended to be worse in winter.

Lance Workman, professor of psychology at the University of South Wales, who oversaw the research for the Weather Channel, said that SAD could be due to mankinds poor genetic adaptation to living in northern latitudes. We havent lived at these latitudes that long  only 50,000 years  so we may not be particularly well adapted to winter.

Ms Harris said: A lot of people wrote to me saying they suffer from SAD, and they would much rather have the extra hour in the evening.

 Yes. And how do you define 'my'? 




 Cool. Artaud served that function for me. 




 In the light, the earth remains our first and last love. Our brothers are breathing under the same sky; justice is a living thing. Now is born that strange joy which helps one live and die, and which we shall never again renounce to a latter time.

With this joy, through long struggle, we shall remake the soul of our time.

 Notwithstanding the violence, maybe there's not all bad with drugs and religion. 




 Yep. That's how I read it at least. 




 The filming of Tennant's Hamlet didn't do it justice. 




 Go read the essay "how many children had lady macbeth"

Yes do. Still fresh after 80 years.

The essay "How many children had Lady Macbeth?" does not attempt to answer the question it poses. Not in the literal sense. What it does attempt to answer is in what sense it is appropriate to answer in when 'answering' Shakespeare. 




 It's about grace.  




 Extraneous question-mark? My advice for your acting would be to be certain in regards to your character's certainty. Or otherwise... 




 Living people once bestowed 'honour' will soon attract critics - detractors - therefore it is impossible to have honour whilst living. 'Suffer' is used in the sense of 'abide' in this instance. 'Detraction' is used abstractly for 'the capacity for detraction amongst men'.

Falstaff's argument is that honour is useless to the dead and impossible to maintain for the living - thus a flimsy 'sticking-plaster' and not a thing of substance. As a shield's ornament ('scutcheon') is to the shield itself so is honour to virtue. Therefore Falstaff'll have 'none of it'. 

Addendum: My sentence concerning 'virtue' may appear to some to overreach the content of the speech. I'd however argue that Falstaff's sense of virtue is intermingled with his sense of pragmatics. 




 The 'y' in 'dayes' evokes the wistful day-time moping ('why, why, why') of the ruminating day-dweller. 

The 'i' in 'daies' evokes the eye that sees his love at night in dreams.

Shakespeare's sonnets are worth reading that deeply.

 I don't think that's true. 




 In the US, federal maternity leave only applies to women that work in companies that employ 50 or more people (not to mention other restrictions). The "50 or more" benchmark applies to most state leave benefits, as well.
Now how many businesses employ 1-49 people? According to census.gov, it is roughly 4.5 million (http://www.census.gov/econ/smallbus.html[1] ). That's not 4.5 million individuals who do not qualify for leave, it's 4.5 million businesses. If the US workforce is somewhere around 156 million, this leaves a HUGE chunk of women (if not the majority) with nothing but the mercy of their employers.
Trust me, I've looked in to the situation. I am one of the women this affects. I am the sole female in a 10 person tech company. First pregnancy in the company's history. I get nothing.
EDIT: btw, I should have started out with the fact that the federal leave most women aren't even entitled to is totally UNPAID!!! It just guarantees that your job will be waiting when you get back 12 weeks later.

On the first day of training, I didnt start the session that well and he tapped me on the shoulder after a half an hour. He said: Are you alright? and I replied, Yeah. And then he asked me: When do you start training then?. That put me under pressure straight away...

 The word 'great' has its own particular connotations. 

Imagine if it was '100 Goodest Britons' (pardon the grammar). A different vibe and would no doubt produce a different type of list, I think. 




 I think Jamie Oliver could be a celebrity/dark-horse candidate who could make the list if it was done today.

Gordon Brown wouldn't be an undeserving inclusion, IMO either. 




 What with all the hagiography/state funeral etc. after her death I wouldn't be surprised if she placed higher.

Agree that Diana would slide down the poll. Her placing last time was a bit of an anomaly, IMO. 




 The decision made by Morgan Freeman's character at the end of the second one could be taken to be an anti-NSA statement though. 














 Im also very worried about drone proliferation, with other countries acquiring these weapons systems. In 1945, only one country possessed a nuclear weapon, and look at the world now. I think the same thing is going to happen with drone proliferation.

 Vicki Janik's introduction to the book I mentioned in my other comment touches on the some of the concerns I had in relation to fooldom:

 In ancient Greece the fool-parasites charmed the wealthy into offering them dinner invitations with the promise of entertainment and joking. One step from being beggars, they exploited their own pretended or real infirmities for food and money. Welsford describes the existence of such figures in Greek and Roman society. Nearly two thousand years later in the courts of Europe, natural and artificial fools still were supported and often entirely maintained by the wealthy. Many courts, including that of Peter the Great, the early-eighteenth-century czar of Russia, kept great numbers of natural and artificial fools. In order to maintain the size of this group, his court went so far as to arrange marriages and funerals for naturals such as dwarves who were wed in grotesque mock ceremonies. Thus, like the jokes they told, natural fools seemed spontaneously to generate and to be forever maintained agelessly; where they had been and when they had left were either unanswerable questions or irrelevant ones.  

Even very famous fools in society lack clear ties to the real world and seem to be at odds with "normal" existence. Will Sommers was born, according to Robert Armin's verse, "in Shropshire, as some say / Was brought to Greenwich on a holy day, / Presented to the king". His heritage is questionable: meager references to family, like that to an "onckle," may be only fictional, having been recorded by Armin from traditional jokes. Armin also writes that while Sommers dined with the king and Cardinal Wolsey or jested with the king alone, he later "laide him downe among the spaniels to sleepe". Such contradictory, atypical experience is representative of the fool. Modern, real-life fools sometimes live similarly unfocused lives. Douglas Brode contends that Woody Allen's persona has penetrated into his private life and is at odds with the private life he tries to live. Although Allen's experiences have been more acutely painful, they reflect the confusion surrounding the private lives of Groucho and Chico Marx. The necessary peripheral objectivity and isolation of the fool perhaps make the intimately shared life of marriage and family difficult.

 Thank you very much. I gave those a read. I've also just come across *Fools and Jesters in Literature, Art, and History A Bio-Bibliographical Sourcebook* edited by Vicki K. Janik which looks like it should be a very informative read. I'll give Christopher Moore's *Fool* a look too. 




 I was struck by the thought on reading *King Lear*. That is set in ancient Britain but anything about jesters/court fools from throughout history would be much appreciated. 

Would they have had families? How were they chosen? Are there instances in which they have been portrayed that are particularly accurate/inaccurate? What are the best sources for finding out more? 





























 Another suggestion that I once read (the source I cannot at the moment find) was that the 'binding' had to do with a gathering together of the wisdom of the ancestors. 




 That site is terrible for pop-ups, I grant you. I watched the whole of *Samsara* with a hellacious, heavy metal soundtrack in the background. I thought it was part of the film. It was just the music from an unnoticed pop-up in a different tab.

I hope you manage to see it. Perhaps try again or using a different device if you can.

Readers were asked to send in ideas for what could take David Camerons place if he chickens out of the election debates. An Eton mess, suggested Roy Brown (that could stand for much of the government), while Adrian Brodkin thought Larry, the Downing Street cat, would be a purrfect substitute.

  Sunday Times analysis showed that despite the Tories increasing the number of female candidates  to 36%, against 24% in 2010  few have any chance of becoming an MP.
 
One third of winnable seats  those lost by less than 10% at the last election  are being contested by Tory women. This contrasts with Labour where all-women shortlists have been used to shoehorn female candidates into seats from which they can realistically reach Westminster.
 
Labour women are set to contest three in five of the partys winnable seats and 10 out of 11 safe seats  classed as those won by more than 10% in 2010. Just under half of female Labour candidates have been chosen from all-women shortlists and 65% of those in winnable seats are the products of such lists.

 **A Christmas Dickens**

*Marley was dead to begin with, there's no doubt about that*

 and thus Charles Dickens' slim little Christmas book gets under way and Scrooge's remarkable journey of reclamation begins. *A Christmas Carol* is a wonderful read, full of amazing parallels that hopefully makes us occasionally re-examine our own existence and how we behave towards to one another.

Just over a hundred and sixty years ago in 1853, Charles Dickens strode at haste across the stage of Birmingham's Town Hall to give the first ever public reading of A Christmas Carol; one of many he was to give that season to benefit the New Midland Institute. Being a great supporter of the working man, Dickens agreed to this reading on condition that seat prices were reduced in order to suit the pocket of the working classes of the town, many of whom were glimpsing their hero for the first time. Here the city's newspaper describes the setting. 

*And thus the day passed and nightfall came on, more bitter and freezing than ever; the bleak wind whistling through the streets most dolefully. It was just such a night that Mr Dickens came to read his Christmas Carol to a small family circle of some 2,000 people in our vast Town Hall. What a grand, fine looking party it was. The lights were so brilliant and the drawing room so gay, and the holly so tastefully wreathed that there could be no mistake about this being Christmas. Then the host himself arrived and took his place in his big armchair and told us that we may laugh and cry as much as we wanted, as he liked nothing better than a lot of sympathy.*

I think we can safely assume that by the beginning of the 1850's, Charles Dickens was most certainly England's first 'superstar.' His fame as a writer was thundering rapidly across Europe and the United States. And his ever changing appearance was becoming known to millions through paintings, engravings and photographs which would appear almost weekly in a variety of periodicals, though many would never have encountered him in the flesh. Certainly very few of the 2000 eager faces who rose to cheer him that evening in 1853. What they would have seen was a gentleman of average build sporting a Frank Zappa moustache (the beard was to arrive later) and a mop of dark tousled hair brushed fiercely almost tempestuously forward. He was expensively attired in full evening dress, with diamond studs glittering in his shirt, a bright red buttonhole, a purple waistcoat and a simple watch-chain. He looked quite spectacular. While the applause continued to build, Dickens glanced fleetingly at the huge assembly of people, took a quick sip of water, and then with theatrical elegance raised a hand for silence. As the applause faded so grew a sense of excitement as everyone leant forward in anticipation of hearing his voice for the very first time. "Marley was dead: to begin with." And so the evening began and continued to do so for three and a quarter hours. 

A Christmas Carol was written in 1843 and published in the same year that Henry Cole brought us the Christmas card; a time for rejoicing and initiating into our homes practices hitherto unheard of at the time, such as good cheer, sharing gifts, much merriment and even Christmas trees. Dickens's sources for the tale appear to be many and varied but are principally the humiliating experiences of his own childhood. But more than anything his distress at the conditions of the poor and the plight of children attending 'Ragged Schools'; organizations run voluntarily and dedicated to the free education of destitute children. It was visiting one such school and seeing the array of bright beaming faces that a seed was planted for a book, a book that he hoped would cheer people's hearts with generous fellowship. As soon as A Christmas Carol was published and the miserable images of Want and Ignorance, whom he describes as being, 'yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, were introduced, people immediately sat up and took notice. Changes were hurriedly made to the Poor Laws, the Factory Acts were repelled and with it came an end to child neglect and slavery. A Christmas Carol has achieved a kind of immortality, born out of the very conditions of the time. 

He poured into the story his own personal memories, especially that of Camden Town and the long walk that Bob Cratchit would have had to make to the City; of his sister Fanny's crippled four year old son, who took on the mantle of Tiny Tim. From his own deep self he drew the understanding that a grown man may pity the child he had been, and learn from that pity, as Scrooge does. 'In short I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the slightest license of a child and yet been man enough to know its value.' 

Dickens decided to set the tone of Carol through the eyes of one man. A mean, pinched, misanthropic old skinflint of a man, uncaring of others whose face 'wore the signs of care and avarice; a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, covetous old sinner; who carried such a low temperature about with him in the street that even the blind man's dog appeared to know him.' According to Dickens he stumbled upon the name while taking an evening walk through a graveyard in Edinburgh. Apparently the headstone was for the wine merchant Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose claim to fame was that he had won the first contract to supply whiskey to the Royal Navy. The inscription identified Scroggie as a 'meal mad (in other words a corn merchant), but, due to the fading light and Dickens mild dyslexia, he may have misread this as 'mean man.' But either way Ebenezer Scrooge, one of literature's most notorious characters, sprung immediately into life. Unfortunately the headstone was lost during reconstruction in 1932. 

It is generally believed that the character of Scrooge was largely based on Gabriel Grub who appeared in Dickens first novel, The Pickwick Papers. Gabriel Grub was a rather misanthropic gravedigger, an 'ill-conditioned, cross-grained, surly fellow, who eyed each merry face as it passed him by, with a deep scowl of malice and ill-humour.' To show his displeasure for the festive season and his keenness for money Gabriel begins to dig a grave on Christmas Eve only to be visited by a gaggle of goblins who drag him down to their goblin kingdom. There he is shown all sorts of misery, even the death of a small, much loved child and awakes a better man. 

Dickens began Carol in September 1843, and in keeping with the title of his work, divided the story into staves. (Using the word metaphorically, instead of chapters) Sometimes the emotion was too much and Dickens would have to break away and take long night walks, 'when, all sober folks had gone to bed,' covering anywhere between 15 or 20 miles. Six weeks later he completed it; and 'broke out' as he himself described, 'like a madman. Such dining, such dancing, such conjuring, such blind-man's buffing such theatre going, never took place in these parts before.' Thackeray, not always an admirer of Dickens, called it a 'national benefit,' an American entrepreneur gave his employees an extra days holiday and Thomas Carlyle went straight out and bought himself a turkey. Stoking up all this cheerfulness was the news that the book had sold 6000 copies at five shillings each on its first day; becoming the most successful Christmas book of the season. (Mind you five shillings was nearly a half week's wage for some). Dickens knew instinctively that he had created a modern fairy story and for the first time been able to complete an entire fiction without being compelled to write in serial form. 

After the success at Birmingham, Dickens took his readings to every major town and city in the country, across to Ireland and eventually the United States of America, where he was greeted like some iconic movie star. But the strain took its toll on his health and he would insist on his doctor sitting in the wings in case of the possibility he might collapse. 

He began with A Christmas Carol and he ended with it. His last reading of the little book took place in London at the St James' Hall, March 15th 1870. At the end of the performance he told his audience that 'from these garish lights I vanish now for evermore, with a heartfelt, grateful, respectful, and affectionate farewell.' There was a stunned silence immediately broken by a tumult of cheering, hat waving and the stamping of feet. With tears streaming down his face, Dickens raised his hands to his lips in an affectionate kiss and departed from the platform for ever; an infinitely sad and broken man. A few days later the Queen, at a private audience, regretted that she had not heard his reading. Dickens expressed his regret but explained he was unable to offer her a private performance, not on the grounds of infirmity, but because, as he told her, a mixed-class audience for him was essential. Etiquette kept him on his feet for the ninety minutes of their conversation, and as a mark of her esteemed respect the Queen did likewise. Charles Dickens was to die three months later at the age of 58. 

*Dickens wrote in the preface of A Christmas Carol:* 

**I have endeavoured in this Ghostly little book to raise the Ghost of an Idea which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.**

*Their faithful Friend and Servant,*

*Charles Dickens*

Looks like it won't start till June. That is if they don't change the date again! I'm deciding to gratefully accept this opportunity to practise non-attachment...

 Thank you. I shall include those names in due course. 




 Thank you very much for that submission. It gives me much to sort through. Of those 560 some might fall outside the label 'artist'. I shall endeavor to follow this up further. 




 This is very much a work in progress. Please feel free to improve it if you can. 









 I'm looking to create a page that could perhaps become a Wikipedia article (or just remain in its current format). I'm sure that there are many more names that I could add. I also hope that it could potentially serve as a historical resource of value in its own right.

 Look closer. 




 The rings are different! Clara's ring in the promo pic has the thicker oval bit run parallel with her finger. The ring in the clip in the episode has the thicker bit run perpendicular to the wearer's finger.

The rings are definitely different.

 The conclusion might well be that there is a conspiracy among the London-based Welsh media to avoid presenting Wales as a country that can have diplomatic relations with other countries. The British states greatest fear must be that if Wales starts behaving like an independent country then it may become an independent state  just like Ireland.

 You can buy toothpastes that claim to whiten teeth. There are also things one can buy at a medium sized pharmacy. I can't personally vouch for them however.

 No. I'm referring to the monastic codes of conduct:

The Suttavibhanga contains the basic training rules for bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, along with the "origin story" for each one. These rules are summarized in the Patimokkha - http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/vin/sv/

The pratimoksha, which has been translated into English, lists the rules but doesn't contain the stories as to how they supposedly came about.

For example, there is a rule about not starting a fire and I'm curious as to what occasioned it.

 1.1 Religion or belief is defined as:

 any religious belief, provided the religion has a clear structure or belief
system. Denominations or sects within a religion can be considered a
protected religion or religious belief. Appendix 2 provides a list of
commonly practised religions in Britain.

 a philosophical belief (see below).

A 2009 Employment Appeal Tribunal decision defined the criteria for
determining what a philosophical belief is. A philosophical belief must:

 **be genuinely held**

 be a belief and not an opinion or viewpoint, based on the present
state of information available

 be a belief as to a weighty and substantial aspect of human life
and behaviour

 **attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and
importance**

 be worthy of respect in a democratic society, compatible with
human dignity and not conflict with the fundamental rights of
others.

Humanism, pacifism and atheism could be examples of philosophical
beliefs.

 There is more on the Human Rights Act [here](http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/your-rights/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/human-rights-act) if you are interested. 









 This paragraph was elided for reasons of brevity and relevance:

The guidance applies not only to Christians, Jews and Muslims but also druids, pagans, Zoroastrians and even atheists. Such employees can ask to be excused any duties they find at odds with their beliefs and also request time off to attend religious festivals or pilgrimages. 




 Any boss with a vegan employee who has strong religious views and profound ecological opinions should brace themselves.

New [published 7 April 2013] guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) will allow that worker to request not to have to fly to meetings, not to sit on a leather chair and not to have to work on important days in their religions calendar.

The document details additional protection to those with profound personal beliefs. It states that employees may assert the right to discuss their personal beliefs in the workplace and employers should not prevent such conversations....

The EHRC guidance, *Religion or Belief in the Workplace: a guide for employers*, has been produced after a series of rulings by the court. These include the landmark ruling giving employees the right to wear a cross or other religious symbols even if it breaches company dress codes.

Vegans could legitimately request having their role altered to ensure they do not have to handle milk, cheese, meat or eggs or even have to sit on chairs made of leather.

Vegetarians could ask to be exempt from duties that contravene their views, such as cleaning out an office fridge that had meat in it.

The Vegetarian Society said the guidance gave official recognition that vegetarianism can be and indeed often is a deeply held belief.

Alex Douglas believes her veganism cost her a job last year and the new guidance might have protected her. The 25-year-old vegan was delighted when she secured a job at a coffee shop in Glasgow and, despite her views, says she willingly handled dairy products.

Three months after joining she was told her passionate views meant she would be better served working in a vegan environment and she was asked to leave. During the working day I would talk about being a vegan. I wouldnt preach at all, she said.

The guidance says ecologists would be permitted to tell colleagues that it is wrong to drive to work because it damages the environment. They could also ask to be excused from duties that increase CO2 emissions, such as flying to business meetings....
Employers would also have to take seriously requests by people to observe religious custom, such as daily prayers for Muslims and the Sabbath for Jews. The guidance says employers should agree unless doing so would cause massive disruption, cost a lot or have an adverse impact on customers.

The guidance asks all employers to review work-place policies and practices to ensure that they do not unjustifiably discriminate against an employee who requests a change due to a particular belief....

It says religious people may also seek to promote their beliefs so long as this is not intimidating, hostile or offensive to others, and leaflets can be distributed.

Mark Hammond, chief executive of the EHRC, said: The right of people to express their religious belief is a vital freedom guaranteed by the European convention on human rights.

 I think you've been led to expect more hydration than is sufficient. 




 'Chien', no doubt.

our names for livestock generally have Anglo-Saxon origins (e.g. sheep, pig, cow) which are exchanged for Anglo-French terms once they are prepared for the table (e.g. mutton, pork, beef).  




 I'd just like to say that I partially regret including the Spectator quote. I don't agree with it. It does help to desimplify the topic of the reception of the documentary but does so at the risk of simplifiying the documentary and the documentary's topic however. 




 The competing critiques come from [Jonathon Sturgeon, Russia Today](http://flavorwire.com/503003/too-dangerous-for-television-adam-curtis-afghanistan-documentary-bitter-lake), and [The Spectator](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/culturehousedaily/2015/01/adam-curtiss-bitter-lake-the-tv-equivalent-of-staging-hamlet-without-the-prince/) respectively.

 Is a worthless whore still a whore? 




 What does your heart most long for? 




 OK. What you meant is, Jew-hate is nothing other than Jew-hate.

The hatred of a white supremacist towards Jews in general might have a large amount to do with their Semitism, qua coming from the Middle East i.e. being brown/associated with 'brownness', in addition to their subscribing to the Jewish faith. It's multi-faceted. 




 The only semitic people in Europe were Jews, and therefore it only applied to jewish people

Ah, I see. That makes sense. Thank you.

that still doesn't make antisemitism anything other than jew-hate.

Can you elaborate? 




 And would it not be correct to refer to Islam as a Semitic religion? 




 Nice. 









 "Monks, it is just as if a donkey were following right after a herd of cattle, saying, "I too am a cow! I too am a cow!" Its color is not that of a cow, its voice is not that of a cow, its hoof is not that of a cow, and yet it still keeps following right after the herd of cattle, saying, "I too am a cow! I too am a cow!" In the same way, there is the case where a certain monk follows right after the community of monks, saying, "I too am a monk! I too am a monk!" He doesn't have the other monks' desire for undertaking the training in heightened virtue, doesn't have their desire for undertaking the training in heightened mind (concentration), doesn't have their desire for undertaking the training in heightened discernment, and yet he still keeps following right after the community of monks, saying, "I too am a monk! I too am a monk!"



"So you should train yourselves: 'Strong will be our desire for undertaking the training in heightened virtue; strong will be our desire for undertaking the training in heightened mind (concentration); strong will be our desire for undertaking the training in heightened discernment.' That is how you should train yourselves."

**EDIT:** Oppressors like the oppressed oppressed. 




 Eloquence from Angus MacNeil:

I listened intently to the speech by Dame Joan Ruddock. She mentioned the 1980sa time I clearly remember as a teenager, when nuclear annihilation was seriously talked about and people did seem to comprehend the awful, frightening and terrifying possibility of the use of nuclear weapons. Over time, people have perhaps become more blas and this has crept into our discourse, so there is not as much understanding of the insanity of nuclear weapons as there used to be. That may be to protect our own sanity personally from day to day, because if we were to comprehend it, it would blight our lives. We have a feeling of powerlessness about it, so why worry about it day to dayif it is going to happen, it is going to happen. I say as a crofter from the highlands, however, that this is akin to the happy lambs who play in a meadow unaware of the autumn slaughterthe mass slaughterto come.

The right hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford reminded us of the wisdom and courage of Colonel Petrov, who had the data and information available to his senses from the best technology available at that timethat the west had fired five nuclear weapons at the USSR. What would have happened if he had acted in the way he was meant to act or in the way we were told he would act, or if he had acted logically on the basis of MADmutually assured destruction? If my memory serves me correctly, this comes from the theories of John Nash, the Nobel prize winner in economics. If Colonel Petrov had responded in that way, I would not have seen my 16th birthday. I have thus had 28 bonus years as a result.

If Colonel Petrov is still alive, I say that if ever there were a man deserving of the Nobel peace prize, it is certainly he. We were saved by our alleged enemiesperhaps by their humanity. We were saved again by a Soviet submarine commander during the Bay of Pigs incidents in Cuba in the early 1960s. The actions of those two men disproved the MAD theories, which were the foundation of the nuclear club to which the UK had itself belonging. They behaved in a way that was outside MAD. They did not do mutually assured destruction, although they thought they would be destroyed themselves.

As the right hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford said, our luck will eventually run out. Nuclear weapons have been in the hands of human beings for only 70 years. Given the two near misses that I have citedand there have been moreI invite Members to engage in a thought experiment. Had nuclear weapons existed since Roman times, how much would history have progressed before nuclear annihilation? If we extend our 70 years to 140, or 210, or 300, how long will it be before it all goes wrong and our luck runs out? If our luck does run out, it will run out big style. I have to say, with respect to my friends in the Green party, that it is not gradual global warming that should be worrying us, but immediate global frying and the destruction of all creationa sin like no other, which may result from omission or commission.

 They dominate British politics.

You may be wondering how many Old Etonians there are in government jobs in 2011. The answer (drumroll) is 12! (Andrew Neil in his programme quite rightly says 8 Old Etonian MPs are in the Government but Ive thrown in Peers who hold jobs in government too  thats how, a bit later on in the programme, he gets to the percentage figure of 10 per cent of Ministers being OEs).

Heres the list:

David Cameron

Lord Howell (Foreign Office minister)

Henry Bellingham (Foreign Office minister)

Lord Astor of Hever (Defence minister)

Hugo Swire (Northern Ireland minister)

Sir George Young (Leader of the Commons)

Oliver Letwin (Cabinet Office minister)

Nick Hurd (Cabinet Office minister)

Philip Dunne (whip)

Bill Wiggin (whip)

Lord DeMauley (whip)

Lord Sassoon (Treasury minister)

Believe it or not but honey brought in from overseas contains bacteria and spores that are very harmful to honeybees. If you leave a honey jar outside it encourages honeybees to feed on the remaining honey. There is a good possibility that this will infect the bee and in turn the bee will infect the rest of the colony resulting in death of the colony. Always wash out honey jars and dispose of them carefully.

If we're being pedantic, I'd say that you meant to say that the statement was 'tautologous'.

Tolkiens original dust-jacket design for The Hobbit is currently on public display as part of the Bodleian Librarys Marks of Genius exhibition.


It sits alongside other treasures of the Bodleian Library including a 1217 engrossment of Magna Carta, Shakespeares First Folio, the Gutenberg Bible, and much more.

The exhibition aims to look at ways in which attitudes towards genius are manifested in a number of remarkable books and manuscripts, and exploring how works of genius found in a university library can be acquired, collected and read.

It is located in the newly-opened Weston Library (Broad Street, Oxford), which houses the Bodleians archival collections including a substantial amount of Tolkiens papers. The exhibition will close 20 September 2015.

 weren't enough Anglo-Saxons to completely dominate the native gene pool

This article goes into more detail: 

* ['Myths of British ancestry' by Stephen Oppenheimer in *Prospect* magazine](http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/mythsofbritishancestry)

But **the English still derive most of their current gene pool from the same early Basque source as the Irish, Welsh and Scots**. These figures are at odds with the modern perceptions of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon ethnicity based on more recent invasions. There were many later invasions, as well as less violent immigrations, and each left a genetic signal, but no individual event contributed much more than 5 per cent to our modern genetic mix.

What determines which countries see a doodle and which don't?
 




 A pioneer in Buddhist revival in India. He encouraged lower-caste Hindus to convert to Buddhism.

He was prominent in India's birth as an independent nation and wrote her constitution. 

Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar, the great leader of the Dalits, was determined to liberate people from poverty, injustice and caste oppression. Between 1923 and 1956 he worked tirelessly in the Indian political system as an advocate for human rights, and rose to become the first Law Minister of the new Indian nation and the chief author of its Constitution. The new Constitution made untouchability illegal, but Dr. Ambedkar came to believe that true social change could only come by leaving behind the cultural and religious beliefs that justified the caste system. In 1956, shortly before his death, he initiated a wave of mass conversions to Buddhism  a spiritual tradition free of prejudice.

 The best first step is probably finding yourself a teacher. See what Buddhist temples and/or centers exist in your area, do your research about them and pay them a visit. 

The [World Buddhist Directory presented by Buddha.net](http://www.buddhanet.info/wbd/) might be useful for this. Keep in mind however that it is not exhaustive.

 Perhaps: 
 What started your interest, and what's maintained it?

How would you introduce/teach standing meditation to a meditator who is new to it? 




 I trust this will be helpful if you relate to this sort of thing. [Here is a picture of Amoghasiddhi with his hand in the mudra of fearlessness.](https://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m34lcbMuRm1r2ejc3o3_r1_500.jpg) 




 Thank you. I love hearing all these differing approaches - it vivifies, and is vivacity itself. Were you inside or outside doing this? Barefoot or in training shoes? 




 Thank you. I found the contextualisation of it within walking meditation illuminating. I appreciated the tips for the walking meditation too. I hope to be able to try some of those approaches.

Thanisarro Bhikku. I'd been aware of some of his translations on Access to Insight but didn't know he has written on meditation practice, let alone so lucidly. The canonical works are very good for the Buddha essence yet it is this sort of Guru giving practical advice that is so valuable for the West/English speaking world which has less of a tradition in meditation compared to the East. The Buddha/buddhists of old were part of a yogic milieu that I believe 'shorthanded' canonical meditation advice. Teachers and writers on meditation should be treasured - particularly those using the language one speaks! 

Thank you very much for sharing. I shall revisit this and hopefully assist in some way to passing on the merit. Sadhu, ZFree2013! 




 Would you like to share more about about your experience? 




 Have you ever tried standing meditation in a more formal setting - as you do with your sitting meditation?

 From my cursory research on the subject it appears that there are some traditions that use standing meditation as a way to transition the awareness and mindfulness gained 'in the midst of stillness' to awareness and mindfulness 'in the midst of commotion'. 

There are two modes of Son Buddhist meditation: "Son in the midst of stillness" and "Son in the midst of commotion." I like to refer to them as simply the "quiet" and "active" modes of meditation. Quiet meditation commonly refers to traditional seated meditation but includes any meditative form where you're not moving. Active meditation refers to meditating while in motion in the midst of daily life.

Active meditation is considered more advanced and confers the advantage of not having to set aside a special time and place to meditate. Another great benefit is that once you have mastered being able to meditate wherever you are, you can begin to use meditation as a therapeutic coping mechanism to recover from unexpected surprises right on the spot and as a method of improving your way of communicating and behaving. In a word, active meditation is both healing and empowering.

Practically speaking, however, in order to get to this level we first have to learn how to meditate in a variety of physical postures. So today I'll share with you the method of meditating in a standing position.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hwansan-sunim/how-to-meditate-standing-_b_6273180.html 




 Would you like to explain more? Does your practice of mantra recitation differ when standing to alternative postures? If so, could you say how? 




 Thank you, that's all very helpful. It's something I'd like to focus more on though I don't believe it is much practised in my particular sangha - it certainly isn't taught at a formal level to the extent of my knowledge. I was just looking to accrue any information on the topic so I had some more sense of the tradition/context before broaching the subject with my fellow sangha members and/or exploring the practice by myself. 

Thank you again - I shall be investigating further. My interest was sparked in part by someone I met on retreat who said that when meditating outdoors he felt he got a lot of merit from a process of engaging in sitting meditation followed by standing meditation followed by walking meditation and repeating this once. Furthermore, there will be a retreat next year with a 'theme' of the archetype of the king and I thought that  a practice of standing meditation could in some way contribute. I believe my intuition came from how Nelson Mandela wrote in his autobiography of his experience seeing Haile Selassie:

The conference was officially opened by our host, His Imperial Majesty, who was dressed in an elaborate brocaded army uniform. I was surprised by how small the emperor appeared, but his dignity and confidence made him seem like the African giant that he was. It was the first time I had witnessed a head of state go through the formalities of his office, and I was fascinated. **He stood perfectly straight**, and inclined his head only slightly to indicate that he was listening. **Dignity was the hallmark of all his actions.**

The head inclining is contrary to the Buddha's 'elephant look' but I believe the rest could be evoked in a way congruent with right intention and I hope right view and action. 

Feel free to comment further if you'd like. 




 Thank you. That's helpful. That's not something that I would have noticed. What is obvious to some is not obvious to others.

Also fog does appear at Beachy Head. That this particular image was touched up does not repudiate that. Though of course these are two separate issues. Fog manifests in many forms - meteorological, pictorial, intellectual, and emotional.

Apologies for my earlier tone. My burden of proof point stands though I think.

 On thy stupendous summit, rock sublime!

That oer the channel reared, half way at sea

The mariner at early morning hails,

I would recline; while Fancy should go forth,

And represent the strange and awful hour

Of vast concussion; when the Omnipotent

Stretched forth his arm, and rent the solid hills,

Bidding the impetuous main flood rush between

The rifted shores, and from the continent

Eternally divided this green isle.

Imperial lord of the high southern coast!

From thy projecting head-land I would mark

Far in the east the shades of night disperse,

Melting and thinned, as from the dark blue wave

Emerging, brilliant rays of arrowy light

Dart from the horizon; when the glorious sun

Just lifts above it his resplendent orb.

Advances now, with feathery silver touched,

The rippling tide of flood; glisten the sands,

While, inmates of the chalky clefts that scar

Thy sides precipitous, with shrill harsh cry,

Their white wings glancing in the level beam,

The terns, and gulls, and tarrocks, seek their food,

And thy rough hollows echo to the voice

Of the gray choughs, and ever restless daws,

With clamor, not unlike the chiding hounds,

While the lone shepherd, and his baying dog,

Drive to thy turfy crest his bleating flock.

*

The high meridian of the day is past,

And Ocean now, reflecting the calm Heaven,

Is of cerulean hue; and murmurs low

The tide of ebb, upon the level sands.

The sloop, her angular canvas shifting still,

Catches the light and variable airs

That but a little crisp the summer sea,

Dimpling its tranquil surface.

 We're talking about the 20th/21st rather than the 15th century, your point about holy orders at Oxbridge is thus entirely irrelevant.

Relevant up to 1871 actually.

Universities Tests Act 1871

1871 CHAPTER 26 34 and 35 Vict

An Act to alter the law respecting Religious Tests in the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and Durham, and in the Halls and Colleges of those Universities.

**http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/34-35/26** 




 The universities of Oxford and Cambridge of course used to be exclusively male. The fact that their professors had to take holy orders too perhaps makes considering it a 'non-religious school' dubious. 

Also worth considering in terms of social science is the differences between America, and the UK and Europe concerning the distinction between colleges and universities. 




 From [Caroline Lucas' interview in today's Guardian:](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/28/caroline-lucas-im-not-playing-about)

In May, she might well make trouble for the mainstream political parties. Lucas knows that if the Greens have a good election, it could be bad news for Labour and result in a Conservative victory. She says that a second Tory term is the last thing she wants, but, in the long term, it could be the best thing possible for the Greens if Labour lost. That wouldnt be the outcome I wished for. But I would think, Now, for heavens sake, Labour, you have to embrace electoral reform because we are operating under a voting system that is creaking at the seams, that is not fit for purpose. This would probably come in some form of proportional representation, which could only empower the Greens.

I can see the logic and think it might galvanise some former Labour voters toying with voting Green.

 I don't like the author's use of the phrase 'ill afford'. However, I believe this may interest some and provide food for thought. 




 Newar Buddhism is sometimes accused of being a confused mixture of Hinduism and Buddhism. Given he social and political situation of the country, it is perhaps inevitable that there would be a certain blurring of the lines between the two. However, the contention is based on the debatable supposition that there were at any time in India clear-cut distinctions between the two at the level of folk religionsthat is, at the level of the religious practice of the laity. Later innovations in practice and doctrine were, no doubt, largely introduced into Buddhism and interpreted in a Buddhist sense by the teachers of the age precisely because they were current among the masses. Moreover for the last six hundred years in Nepal there has been social and political pressure on the Buddhist community to conform more to orthodox Hindu customs. As a result, this process, which was an ongoing one throughout the history of Buddhism in India, has continued in Nepal. Festivals, images, customs, and the like were adopted and given a Buddhist meaning. Finally, there is a great similarity between the yogic practices and the iconography of Hindu and Buddhist tantrism. The philosophical differences between Hindu and Buddhist interpretations of even the most fundamental tantric concepts are profound, but once the spirit of scholarship began to decline the differenes were no longer so clear. hence the seeming confusion of the present situation is due rather to a decline of scholarship and the incarnation of Buddhism in Indian religious culture, than to a fusion of Hinduism and Buddhism peculiar to the Valley of Nepal.

The opening of Nepal in 1951 to the outside world, the passage of a new legal code, and the spread of educaton in the valley have brought the Buddhist community of the valley to a juncture. The legal code has removed restrictions of caste, a social phenomenon having no justification in Buddhist teaching but with tenacious vested interests in the Buddhist community. The educated youth are drifting away from old rituals and practices as their world becomes increasingly secularized. The economic situation of the valley is changing from a purely agricultural one to one in which more an d more people are engaged in business, government service, the tourist industry, etc. The result is that the ancient round of feasts and festivals is becoming an economic burden and a sacrifice of time people can ill afford. The youth of the Buddhist community are devout and the social force of their religion is still strong, but the social structure is weakening and they are looking for something more relevant. At the same time the level of scholarship among the Vajracharyas leaves them withouth proper guidance. At least some of the younger Vajracharyas are aware of the problem and have recently formed a group to face the present challenge and adapt their traditions.

 aren't feasible

I don't know what you're basing that on. Consider this:

**A + B  B**

Increasing the number of stages in the food production process by eating animal products, rather than plant matter first hand, creates waste. According to Joni Seager et. al in The State of the Environment Atlas,
In cycling our grain through livestock, we wasted 90% of its protein and 96% of its calories. An acre of cereal can produce five times more protein than an acre devoted to meat production; and legumes (beans, lentils, peas) can produce ten times as much. Thus the greater the human consumption of animal products, the fewer people can be fed.

An omnivorous diet wastes resources that the world just does not have. Faced with a growing population, we must use our resources as efficiently as possible so as to avoid famine, conflict over scarce resources, and climate chaos.

**Land**

According to a UN Food and Agricultural Organisation 2005 report The State of Food Insecurity in the World, a varied vegan diet only needs a fifth of the land of a typical European omnivorous diet. The animal industry has a devastating impact on the land. Expansion of livestock production is a key factor in deforestation. In a process known as hamburgerisation cattle graze on cleared land, moving to yet more land once they have destroyed the fertility of the soil. World Resources Institute assessments suggest that 20-30 per cent of the worlds forest areas have already been converted to agriculture. To feed animals in order to eat animal products will not satisfy humanitys food needs.

**Water**

Animal production uses huge quantities of water to grow crops for their feed, for them to drink, and during the processing of their carcasses. A study financed by the California Beef Council found that the production of one kilogram of beef uses 3700 litres of water, the equivalent of 40 baths or 300 toilet flushes. A different study from Cornell University put the water usage for one kilogram of beef at 100,000 litres. For comparison a kilogram of maize uses 77 litres, wheat 119, and barley 2174. With more than one billion people already unable to access enough safe water to meet their needs5, and this number likely to rise, we must prioritise a sustainable diet over a meat-based one.

 Ok. So you're talking geographically not demographically. The difference between a planet and a world relies on the presence of an experiencer, the existence of a consciousness.  




 Because I believe that animal suffering and exploitation is a matter of extreme importance. 

Whether someone is a vegan is a heuristic that allows me to identify them as someone who shares my views on this matter and thus receive my support and cooperation. 

I trust that I am not alone on either of these points.

 Something tells me you haven't read the article. 




 This is the article the Independent's piece referred to:

**A 15-year-old dies but the war goes on. Why wont we make drugs legal?**



The world is not the same for me now, says Anne-Marie Cockburn, whose 15-year-old daughter, Martha Fernback, died after taking ecstasy. But if someone like me can pave the way for change, that would be good.

Ms Cockburn has hauntingly beautiful eyes  the fact that her only child had the same eyes makes the pictures of them unbearably poignant. But she is unusual in another way too. As a bereaved parent, she is not demanding some kind of crackdown. She is asking  quietly and sombrely  for drugs to be regulated and legalised.

When Martha Fernback died, it was not the first ecstasy tablet she had taken. What her mother has painfully had to accept is that perfectly normal teenagers take foolish risks. High or dead? she says. No parent wants either, but one is preferable.

We have all been teenagers. We have all known the attraction of doing something illicit, dangerous. Yet the whole war on drugs is predicated on a wilful misreading of human psychology: the insistence that criminalising drugs will stop people taking them.

On the contrary. In the latest British Crime Survey 16% of 16 to 24-year-olds in the UK admit that they have dabbled in drugs in the past year. Given that respondents are admitting to something illegal, the true figure is likely to be higher.

The same thing happened under Prohibition in America in the 1920s and 1930s. The ban on liquor increased the number of hard drinkers, even though alcohol prices soared. It also created a criminal class of bootleggers, whose financial interest lay in supplying alcohol and encouraging their customers to become addicted.

Todays bootleggers, in the drugs trade, have made this into a fine art. With their sports cars, tattoos and jewellery, they are role models for many kids on bleak estates. They offer free samples. They evade the police and customs. They know how to stealthily upgrade their customers from soft stuff to hard. Cocaine has moved up to crack and cannabis to skunk, concentrated forms that are devastating. And they increase their profits by cutting drugs such as ecstasy and cocaine with other substances. The inquest into Martha Fernbacks death heard that the average street-level purity of ecstasy is 58%. These products can be more dangerous than the pure forms of the drugs, as any A E doctor will testify.

Britains equivalent of Prohibition was the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. Before that, addiction was treated as an illness, and heroin addicts were prescribed their drugs by their GP. There were very few addicts, and no crime associated with heroin. The effect of the act was to hand these people over to unscrupulous gangs who had every incentive to turn more people into junkies  and many of those turned to crime to feed their habit.

The result is that, in 40 years, Britain turned roughly 10,000 addicts into something more like 250,000. The resulting misery affects not only those people and their families, but all the people whove been threatened and robbed. The cost of drug-related crime in England and Wales is estimated at 14bn a year. Then theres the cost of keeping people in prison. About 10% of the prison population is there for possession or supply, but most need treatment, not punishment.

No other industry of this scale is unregulated, untaxed and in the hands of criminals. Drugs are now the second-largest revenue-earner for organised crime, with profit margins sometimes higher than those on luxury goods. Those profits fuel all sorts of other nasty crimes, including trafficking. The Sunday Times has recently exposed the fact that cannabis drug lords are trafficking Vietnamese girls to work in UK nail bars.

Legalising production, supply and consumption could put paid to the whole, vile industry. Putting the market in the hands of licensed sellers would make the supply safer. And going into the corner shop, rather than sidling up to someone on the street, might make the whole act of purchase less glamorous.

Admittedly, if buying an ecstasy tablet became as easy as buying a pack of cigarettes, usage would probably rise, at least at first. And the state is understandably uncomfortable about appearing to condone a dangerous habit. But the annual number of deaths from alcohol and tobacco dwarfs the annual number of deaths from drugs.

Licensed drug sellers would also pay tax. Together with the 2bn spent on fighting the drugs trade each year, this money could treat addiction and fund education campaigns. Overcrowded prisons would be relieved of people who are desperately vulnerable to drugs while inside. A doctor recently explained to me how random drug tests encourage inmates to move on to harder drugs: unlike cannabis, which stays in the body for weeks, opiates can be sweated out in two days.

Big cracks are beginning to show in what was once a solid wall of global prohibition. In defiance of the UN-mandated war on drugs, more and more countries are beginning to experiment. Last week the Jamaican government announced that it will decriminalise possession of marijuana. And the drugs policy charity Transform published a report on Portugal, which decriminalised the possession of all drugs for personal use in 2001. The report finds that drug-related deaths have decreased. And while lifetime drug use has increased slightly, use seems to have declined among the 15-24 age group.

These moves from prejudice to evidence are hugely cheering. In Holland city mayors are lobbying the government to let them supply cannabis to coffee shops. Uruguay has become the first country to regulate cannabis possession, production and supply. The US states of Washington and Colorado are doing something similar, and Oregon and Nevada are likely to vote soon.

It is time for British politicians to look again at what is being learnt around the globe. Once you accept that people have not been deterred from taking drugs, policy can become more pragmatic. Holland has walk-in labs where users can test the purity of a drug they are about to take.

Responding to Anne-Marie Cockburns comments after the inquest this week, the crime prevention minister Norman Baker made the following statement: The UKs approach on drugs remains clear: we must prevent drug use in our communities, help dependent individuals through treatment and wider recovery support, while ensuring law enforcement protects society by stopping the supply.

Those last three words give the game away. We are not stopping the supply. We have lost control of it.

As a Liberal Democrat, Mr Baker should be challenging such an illiberal policy. It takes a brave politician to overcome the hysteria that occludes this issue. But the fact that the war on drugs has failed is demonstrated by the fact that a middle-class girl in a north Oxford school has died. Her mothers courageous plea deserves a proper hearing  and a more coherent response.
