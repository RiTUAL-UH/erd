 Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's kinda the fucking point. 




 Wait, why? Because other people are writing the material, or because no roast material will ever come close to what Kat had for Flava Flav? 




 Exactly what I thought. Running up to the big guy like "He's scared! He can't fuck with you, dude!" Probably going to be yammering away next to him for the rest of the day, pointing out other skinny kids: "You could take him, Mike! Is it cool that I call you Mike?" 




 Ugh. I mean, I get as much of a kick out of the fat acceptance movement as the next guy, but I sure as shit don't hate people for it. It's just flat out hilarious. "Look at me, I'm beautiful!" Ok sweetheart. Keep telling yourself that.  




 I had no idea we didn't like her. Quick, someone tell me why I should hate her too!

 When did the Marine Corps get involved? 




 Whaaat? I thought this was fucking fantastic! 




 EVERY GODDAMN TIME.

"Honey. Honey. Go gown on me."

"Have you showered?"

"Yeah of course."

*sniffs*

"Nope."

Damn you, ball sweat. 




 Yeah. That's why I consider it a very poorly executed good idea. 




 It depends on what kind of writing you want to do, but for most creative stuff you'd want to **start simple**. 

I started with American lit, Kerouac, Thompson, Twain etc. Their stories are accessible, entertaining, and well written. Diving straight into the REALLY good stuff, especially writers like Vonnegut, tends to discourage beginner writers because they are such masters of their craft they make it appear dead easy. So easy you think there's no way you could ever fucking come close it what they do. It's not easy. And if they had felt that way, they wouldn't be the writers they became. Writing is fucking masochistic when you get down to the nitty gritty, and the best writing will convey the exact opposite. I can't tell you the amount of times I've put down a book after reading a sentence and thought: "Well fuckit. Guess I'll be a teacher now."

After that, I'd say stick with writers that are generally praised for good writing. For masterclasses in novel writing, my top recommendations are Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon, Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, Lolita/Pnin/Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov, anything Dahl (seriously), Hero of a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell, Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut, and probably many more that I can't remember right now.

OH.

And A Farewell To Arms. Hemmingway. I have a first edition and it's far and away my favourite book. 




 This is great advice. Also, never ask a writer to edit. I was constantly asked to help with people's papers in college. The guys never took my suggestions seriously because it assaulted their pride, the girls just fucking cried.  




 In novel writing this would apply. Depends on whether you want to go down in history or make a buck. As a reporter, you're doing it for the history. You are providing your society with a fair and accurate account of events (ideally). You have no place in deciding what the people want. I've published a few big stories in my time and they've resulted in fundamental, tangible change for the better. But you can bet your ass I was dragged through the coals for it.  




 Definitely. I was a hockey goalie for a season. Lots of contact. LOTS of hate. Few things as satisfying as a sneaky slash to the back of a guy's calf as he's screening you. 




 I've found that this ESPECIALLY applies to writing on a deadline. In fact, writing on a deadline is where I learned this the most. "Don't be afraid to write a shitty lede." Chances are if you're writing on a deadline that requires such precision, you're already a good writer. So "shit" is relative. If I have to have 1800 words in quick, I disregard all thoughts of structure or my lede, parcel the story out, then arrange it in an informative and, hopefully, captivating structure. Then go through and tweak each paragraph so it has a smooth, logical flow.  




 That never worked for me. Personally I prefer to write sober, edit stoned. 




 Yes x1000000. He puts it way better than I do. I wrote a screenplay called "101 Banditos" in my teens. I shudder thinking about it. It was.... I can't. It was bad. Really bad. BUT. It was about a former slave turned bounty hunter in the wild west... Now I look at it as one of the best ideas I've ever had, just a very poorly executed one. 




 Hire an editor or bed a comp lit major. 




 Ehhhhh. I dunno. There's A LOT of shit out there you could do with avoiding. My mother comes to mind. 

Me: "Mom, have you read 50 Shades of Grey?"

Mom: "I don't have enough time to read crap, let alone 50 shades of it."
 




 I always loved it when a team had a good striker that I knew I had to be on point for. I suppose being made to score good goals is just as challenging and rewarding as being made to make good saves. 




 Me too......... How bout them Yankees? 




 I outline HEAVILY to avoid exactly this. I also smoke. And outlining and smoking go well together. 




 Nabokov's wife fished Lolita out of the trash. [I always defer to Ira when I hear this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbC4gqZGPSY)  




 You'd have to be a fucking moron to send something that reads like it's been written by one. The point is that you go back and make it better, ace. 




 Precisely! When I was in advertising, my boss wouldn't allow us to present an ad unless we had literally sketched out a thousand ads before it. He'd plop a fresh stack of printer paper in front of you and tell you to have drawn an ad on every sheet by lunchtime. The point isn't to sit around and think carefully about each ad. You scribble an idea as quick as possible and move on. Once you're finished, sift through the paper, pick out the best, repeat. 




 You're right. I wish that wasn't the case though. I had to read a lot of academic literature as a newspaper reporter and quickly realised I had no objective way of judging what I was reading. It was just too bogged down in a jargon I was totally unfamiliar with, and I didn't have the time to become familiarised. I think that's the problem with science and media right now. Neither industry makes much of an effort to communicate with each other in a way everyone will understand. The stuff that IS well communicated is usually the stuff scientists complain about getting stupid amounts of coverage.  




 Fun fact. My friend banged him in Vegas. 




  Pretty soon, you and your audience will like what you've written, as long as you have good taste.

FTFY

Pro writing tip #2: Read good shit. 




 I mean dont be afraid to write poorly. Don't worry about spelling mistakes (god knows F Scott Fitzgerald didn't. His editor was a goddamn saint for transcribing his scribble into books), finnicky grammar, poor sentence structure, insufficient conveyance of an idea. If it's slowing your progress, don't worry about it and move on. The most important aspect of writing is writing. Anything that stops that pursuit should be scythed off like a wart. 




 I've written professionally in television, newspapers, magazines, PR, and advertising for more than a decade. My number one piece of advice to writers (and this applies to all forms of writing, whether it's a cover letter on your CV, a college essay, or a novel) is don't be afraid to write like shit. 

Worrying over whether it's "good" or not is an exercise you save until you're done. Write an awful sentence. Shit, write an awful chapter. Mark it. Go back and change it later. 

This has served me better than any other writing tip I've ever come across.

EDIT: Do not write drunk and edit sober. Hemingway didn't do that, and besides, he's fucking Hemingway.

EDIT 2: Do what you want. I'm not sure I like the front page. Tis a silly place. 

EDIT 3: I'd love to respond to all the messages for advice and feed my ego, but the sausages popping in the kitchen are more appealing right now. Everyone asking for tips on how to get into writing, there's a reason that word is a gerund. Writing is something you do. Do it. If you don't know what to write, read. Simples. Stay gold, ponyboy.  




 All your mothers were seriously lax on manners. I'd get crucified for not greeting people properly. 




 Ah, so very true, but those were the greatest compliments! I'd get a half chub if a striker refused to shake my hand after the match. 




 As in players give keepers respect for good saves more than you might think. 




 Was a keeper through college. Nothing beats the satisfaction of this. Happened more than you'd expect. 




 I seem to remember hearing or reading somewhere that he had a writer for these kinds of speeches. Can any confirm or deny that? 




 That's exactly how the best interviewers do it. See: Robert Durst.  




 The all boy's middle school I went to would suggest otherwise. Nobody is stopping you and your buddies from gathering peacefully.  




 And now single! Hiyoooooooooo 




 Holy shit. Kenny vs Spenny.... now those are two names I've not heard in a long, long time. 




 Someone rang? 




 I had a one night stand the other night and once the willy came out the girl gives me this disappointed look and says: "I was told it was bigger." 

Long story short, there's a rumour going around that I have a large penis. I don't. Really not sure how to feel about it.  




 Well shit, that's a lot better than I usually get. Once was told I'm like an autistic Brad Pitt... 




 On YouTube, if anyone find my news presenting skills funny enough. I'm going to be a news anchor! Look out, Robin Scherbatsky!

 I have to get it cut in a few month for my new job (I'm gonna be on the tv!) Really, really not looking forward to it :( 




 It is fabulous, at times. Other times it's fabulously annoying. Dont get me started about driving with the windows down. 




 I will be the bouffant whore Reddit craves. Not because I want to. Because I have to. 




 Of course. But again, meet anybody involved in feminism beyond online flame wars and they'll agree men need better treatment in family court. I'd refer to RBG again on this issue.

...gender discrimination is bad for everyone. It also ends the stereotype of women as givers of child care and men as solely breadwinners. [We need to] tear down those barriers so a woman or a man could pursue whatever path in life they had the G-d given talent to pursue.

Also, it's "per se" not "say" 




 Also, a little teapot. Not that short. Kinda stout.  




 Fahd had just died and Abdullah was the regent. 




 I like the cut of your jib 




 Yissssssssssss. Fuck yeah TAL. 




 Seriously. Can we get a source on that? 




 Big props to the pastor. 




 I mean this in the kindest way possible, but please, try and reserve your opinions for when they are informed. I'm not from the US either, but I went to school there. One of my best friends is as gung-ho feminist as they come. She's a clinic defender, someone abortion clinics hire to help when people protest. What you see on the Internet is NOT feminists. They are people who talk about feminism. There's a big difference. Every gender studies, women studies major I've met has a firm understanding of the challenges men face and agree with me on all the standard MRA points. First wave feminism most certainly did not fix the outmoded gender stereotypes men face, just as it didn't do that for female gender stereotypes. I'd really encourage you to speak to real women who are actually on the ground doing feminist work rather than sitting on Tumblr complaining about cis male privilege.  




 Outmoded gender stereotypes? Have you ever met an actual feminist outside of Tumblr? RBG has done more for men in America than any other person. 




 My asshole dad refused to go to the doctor about his heart pains and died at 41 of a heart attack. Asshole. 




 What "right" has been taken away from you because of women? I'm genuinely curious. They are men's issues. They deserve to be discussed, absolutely, but the idea that women are leading the charge against us is retarded. 




 My boss would have thrown a book at me. Or whatever hard object is in his immediate vicinity.  




 Ugh. I wish I had an asshole dad. Well, any dad would be nice. 




 Only when my mother is pissing me off, for some reason. Usually though I just take it out on some fish or lobster. 




 It's really discouraging to see so many male-oriented subs go the way of women bashing. Even Men's Rights. I subbed because I thought we were going to discuss issues that effect men. Nope. It's a giant bitch fest about the women they all can't get. Even RP had an initial edginess to it, like you're approaching life as a predator. Nope. Bitch fest.

Can there be a sub for guys who like talking about guy things and have no problem with the women in their lives? Because right now I really don't think that exists. 




 I mean, that's pretty much how I react to stubbing my pinky toe. So I think mildly perturbed does it justice. 




 Hey. Let's not go allocating blame here. I think everyone is sorry, right? Right?  




 Anger and hatred? I'm mildly perturbed. That's all. 




 I... I'm sorry. I got a little heated. You said some things. I said some things. Let's put it behind us. 




 Your personal experience does not equal prejudice or racism. Prejudice is literally a preconceived notion based on ignorance.  




 EDIT: I have anger management issues. 




 What? C'mon now this is nonsense. I like the spirit of this sub. This is more RP crap.  




 Yep. Got detention as a kid for using it in that context. Didn't know it had an alternate meaning, so naturally the teacher wasn't too please I called him queer. 




 There's something oddly... non sexual about your pose. I have the most confused non boner. Awesome either way. 10/10. 




 Shut up, Scott. 




 I respectfully disagree. 




 Ah. So, like DBZ GT? 




 Yes, yes it is. Well done. And this is all from his wife, who has relayed it back to her uncle (my step dad) 




 Oh... Well I feel dumb. I thought the Star Wars stories went on, and these are just putting them into film form. 




 If I got the chance. They were supposed to come stay with us a few times now, but each time they cancelled because of filming etc.

From what I've heard, Adam starts out good, then turns bad, then becomes a Sith (I love Star Wars, just not that informed about it). Is that Kylo Ren's character arch?

 




 Just sharing what I heard. It's the talk of the whole company, obviously. 




 :( 




 I'm very curious to know how OP here has a pristine single page with an internet warning from the 90's... 




 I'm not saying a lower rate is a magic wand. I'd imagine you could marry a number of policies with it to incentivise companies into coming back to America, though. It's a pretty big subject for us in Bermuda, being a tax haven, and everyone's asshole gets a bit tighter around election time and we wonder what it would take for us to no longer be an attractive jurisdiction. And frankly, I don't think it would take much. Companies are far from peachy here. The IB environment has only just gotten friendly again after the ousting of the Progressive Labour Party in 2012, so we're seeing an uptick in new company registrations, but honestly myself and others really don't think it would take a whole lot to sink our economy and start floating yours. Take that as you will, I suppose. 




 There's nothing illegal about re-domiciling. That's why it's called a loophole.  




 Just the opinion of a guy living in the country where all your businesses domicile to avoid taxes, but I happen to think lowering the corporate tax rate would be the best way to start reeling in that lost tax revenue. They talk about closing the tax loopholes every election cycle and never do. Seems to me a good way to keep American companies paying taxes in America is to give them less reasons to domicile overseas.

 I prefer my women to be conscious when I disappoint them, thankyouverymuch 




 It was Halloween at Western University in London, Ontario, and my friends and I were hitting up an amazing burger join just outside of the bar we'd been drinking at. 

I go for a piss after ordering my food and find an apparently very drunk girl lying on the bathroom floor. I sit her up and try to get her talking, but all she keeps saying is "I hardly had anything to drink." She's pretty much incapacitated.

So I help her to her feet and get her out of the bathroom and sit her down at a table, then return to my friends and ask them what I should do. The logical choice was to help her into a cab, so I helped her back up again, walked to the street corner with her, and flagged down a cab.

Cab comes, but the girl is too far gone to even remotely remember where she lives and the cabbie refuses to take her. She manages to communicate to me that her house is on the road we're standing on and that she can point it out, but the cab driver still refuses to take her alone. 

A bit pissed, I get in the cab with her. She starts slurring about how she barely drank anything again, and then starts trying to kiss me, at which point it clicks that she's probably been drugged. I push her off me and she tells the cab driver to stop and that her house is right here. Cab pulls over, I go to pay him, and she bolts from the door and begins running down the sidewalk. "Ok awesome," I think. "I did my best." Nope. She stumbles and face-plants right into the concrete.

So I pick her ass up again, pretty frustrated with the whole situation at this point. She's bleeding from her forehead and yammering incoherently, but says her house is "right there." We get to the door and there's a party still going on inside. Her housemate answers the door, I tell him I "found her like this" and she fucking belts: "HE ROOFIED ME." Housemate clocks me in the nose before I can respond, sending me down the flight of stairs leading up to the door. Bang my head on the concrete. Housemate kicks me in the stomach, lays on a few more punches, and leaves me there.

Now drunk, concussed and bleeding from my nose, I make my way back to my res, find my resident advisor and go to the hospital.

I've never hated a slutty nurse so much in my goddamn life.

EDIT: Shout out to Western. You may remember me as the guy who ran around Saugeen with a boner, or that guy who unwittingly punched the stripper at the Beef Baron. Go Stangs.

EDIT 2: Ya'll motherfuckers need Jesus. Where I'm from, we help people in need of help. Yes it was dumb to get in the cab. GEE, THANKS. I know I fucked up. That's why you're reading this, turdblossom.

 Was the effect of 'yellow journalism' such that it truly convinced a nation -- that valued freedom above all else -- that they were justified in taking freedom away from others? 














 Court reporter here. Was speaking with a lawyer and he was telling me about the time he had to represent someone accused of having sex with a horse. "Did anyone ask why THAT horse, instead of any of the others?" I asked.

"Actually yes," replied the lawyer. "He wanted a stable relationship." 



















 Had an argument with my boss one morning. Was working in broadcast journalism and had set up a series of interviews with politicians to respond to a major story that broke over night. Except that those interviews I set up were being handed to someone else and instead she told me I had to go and talk to orphans and ask them how the economy was effecting them. I laughed, and said "No, Gary can do the orphan story, I'll do MY story, thankyouverymuch." At which point she launched into a tirade, belittling me and basically speaking to me like she was my mother. This has happened a bunch of times. I hung up and texted her. "Please don't speak to me like that again or I will have to quit." I got an immediate response: "Your fired." I was gutted. But as I looked at my phone again, a wry smile creeped across my face and my thumbs went into action....

*you'RE

We haven't spoken since.

**EDIT:** I suppose I should add that I was at my wick's end (EDIT EDIT: FINE. "WITS' END" YOU GLORIOUS PEDANTS) with the company and her as my editor. She was extremely unprofessional. What made this argument special was that she constantly told me I was not delivering enough stories of my own, that she was setting up too many interview for me. Naturally once I start doing this, she hands the best interviews of the day, set up by yours truly, to the chief reporter-- who has stopped talking to me after she handed one of HIS interviews to ME-- and sends me to do some filler about the economy. She was eventually fired and I have since been offered my job back. Twice. 
























 Frankly I think us men should no longer hide our erections in public. For too long now our erections have been oppressed by belt buckles and between our thighs, hurriedly tucked away lest anyone sees. Man will not truly be free until he can be proud of his erection, not ashamed and embarrassed! We get them all the time, for many reasons besides arousal. If a 'liberated' woman can walk around with hard nipples reading 50 Shades of Shit, why can't I walk around with a hard penis? I envision a new era, where penises are not judged by size or breadth or stamina, but valued as utilitarian assets-- a world where, when I get a boner on the train, I can stand with my erection proudly as a free man... 
























 I'm puzzled too. It was at +10 one second. The next it was at -14. Either way, I'll happily take the downvotes on behalf of /r/motorcycles. I don't know a single rider that isn't extremely cautious with their driving. I ride to avoid traffic, but I also ride for the exhileration. At no time do I mesh those two desires. If I want to satisfy my craving for [power](http://www.instantclarkson.com/) I go to a long stretch of empty road near the airport where I live. I even dated a girl that loved the whole motorcycle thing and pissed her off every time she rode with me because she wanted to go fast and I refused.  




 Spot on. I've had a handful of crashes, all but one of them have been because of someone else in a car. The one that wasn't, I ran over a nail that popped my tyre. I've got a theory that a lot of road accidents could be avoided by less restrictive speed limits, and the same logic applies to riding vs driving. In a car it's easy to switch off because of the feeling of security a car provides. If you're on a bike, you're acutely aware that you could go flying 50 feet in the air and land in a ditch if anyone makes a wrong move. Now who is going to be the more cautious driver? 




 On behalf of bikers everywhere, we know. The last thing the majority of riders need is a lecture on their own mortality. The majority of us are respectful and safe.

 I was more thinking of the post where OP used his dead father's last fiver to get a beer when he was legal. It was just a picture of a beer and a fiver, but as someone who lost their father as a teen, I appreciated the post. Begging for donations is different.

 Was in an emotionally abusive relationship for a while. Got out of it when I realized things weren't getting better. Turned out the entire time we were dating she was living undiagnosed with MS, which played a big part in her craziness level. Anyways, this won't be a popular opinion, but I think it takes a particularly weak person to internalise the emotional abuse they're getting. Both men and women. I couldn't ever take a word she said seriously because she was so clearly trying to say the most hurtful thing she could imagine. Why would you give a person like that the time of day? Why let their comments affect you? It never made sense to me.

 Drug treatment courts for non violent drug offenders are some of the most effective courts in the world. Their recidivism rates are miniscule.

 Building a stadium that gives your team an advantage over the visitor is standard practice among most sports. A lot more of the new stadiums in English football do this, not to mention everything they do with the pitch to get an advantage. Also, it's not against the rules. You can't get busted for smoking weed then point out the guy that's drunk and say what he's doing is worse.

 I think Reddit is far past masquerading as anything other than what it is: the most influential website in the world. This happens with a lot of cultural movements, of which Reddit can certainly qualify. They start out with upstanding value systems that people gravitate toward. But the more people gravitate, the harder it becomes to uphold those ideals. Reddit gets more and more popular, requiring more and more money. In order to keep making that money to service the users, values are sacrificed. Goes for political parties, religions, you name it. I'm disappointed but wholly unsurprised. 




 This is my friend's business! Big up Evan! 




 Sorry, but no. Boston. 




 I dont know of many F1 drivers that haven't practiced from an early age.... 




 Thanks. Definitely going on my letter to Santa.  




 Bermuda, the land of pastel shorts, pink beaches, and nonexistent triangles.

That's pretty much what I had in mind. This is in the far off future, mind you. There's no way I could afford flying out to a driving school any time soon. 




 No, unfortunately. Her apt complex doesn't allow pets :( 




 THAT I can understand. Obligatory brush with death story:

 My days riding 50cc scramblers saved my life a few years back. I was going too fast around a blind corner and there was a van parked in the road. I swerved to avoid it but another car was coming in the opposite direction. I hit the brakes hard, locking up my rear which put the bike sideways, skidding straight toward the car. The moment I realized I was going to hit it head on, I let go of the rear brake and the bike popped up and straightened out, grazing the driver's side of the car and sparing my life. 




 Oh dear god no. Definitely not planning on jumping straight into an F1 car. I want to take a proper course and everything. And yes, I drive every day, but only ever under 60kph in beat up Opel Astra. Doesn't exactly hone your driving sense.  




 Unfortunately not. I live on a 21 square mile island where the speed limit is 50kph. Having a burp in an F1 car is high up on my bucket list though. I'm dying to know if I have the balls to give it some real welly.  




 Alonso might disagree there. Or Stirling Moss........ 




 That makes a lot of sense. Sounds similar to MotoGp. I guess what's tripping me up is just a general lack of knowledge for how it feels going fast on four wheels. I've always gotten my kicks on two.  




 I feel like that's probably a good thing. I've only ever seen a fedora worn well in magazines.

 Journalist here. Same thing applies, although it's not so much crying over really horrific shit, more the slow, painful realization as you slip deeper into the rabbit hole of life that nothing is going to change, and there's nothing you can do about it. That said, we do see some pretty awful road fatalities. I didn't think journalism would teach me what a kneecap looks like.

 Fun fact: the "official" system of measurement in the US is actually metric.

EDIT for clarity: the metric system is "the Preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce". 




 The fact that she, armed with only a bachelor's degree in early childhood education, took over an entire magazine when her husband died suddenly, and not only kept the business afloat but managed to cut all our debt, rebrand the magazine, launch four more magazines, publish 12 books, find the most awesome, caring, creative man to love, and raise two kids all at the same time. She also rips mad bongs. Mom's an OG4Lyf.  
























 Hey fuck you, buddy. Who died and made you Conductor of Assumption Junction, eh? Society dictates what's "normal" or not. I mean, sure, there's the whole thing about normality being established by statistical representation of sex and gender identity, but the implication is you're calling non cis NOT normal, and that's mean. Also accurate. BUT MEAN.

 The fuck is everyone angry at then?  




 Yeah. Only a fucking moron or a genius would speak up during something like that. I'm the loudest cunt in the room 90% of the time but you couldn't get me to give my thoughts in a situation like that in a million years.

 Wait. Really? Did a gay couple ask them to cater, or did they just say they wouldn't cater gay weddings? Maybe I run with a different crowd, but a pizza place announcing they're not going to cater a gay wedding is a bit like me announcing I'd rather not make out with the hottest girl in school. 




 That's precisely what I meant by "solution". Apologies that it came off differently, I agree 100%. My point was that the public doesn't understand that the "solution" to addiction is in mitigation, not eradication, and that our current way of dealing with the problem only ends up costing everyone more money and ruining more lives.  




 Very much so. The most interesting aspect of drug treatment court for me was that it's more like a therapy session. I'm of the opinion that if you enjoy using drugs, you should be free to do so until your drug use infringes on the rights of others. That's when your addiction becomes a problem for the state and community to address (although that's not to say it shouldn't be addressed sooner). I'm a big advocate for the "it takes a village" approach. 




 Cassie???? 




 I appreciate it, but I'm only a conduit doing its job. Covering such stories is to my benefit. It just so happens that what benefits me also benefits the public. It's impassioned people such as yourself that really need to be thanked. Without people like you I wouldn't have a story to write. 




 Funny you mention it. I'm looking at Ross Perot's cigarette boat "Blue Thunder" as I write this. 




 It's actually astounding how much push back there is to the idea that sticking a badger in a cage is the best way to make it nice. Alongside the public perception of addiction, I think Americas biggest difficulty will be taking capitalism out of the prison system without plangent screams of "socialism" from the right. We've already seen how hard it is to take capitalism out of health care.

EDIT: clarity 




 Weird. The religious people I know are some of the most positive, genuine, and selfless people I know. I'm as athiest as they come, but still... 




 I've reported on the rehabilitation of non-violent drug offenders for a while now. Was given unprecedented access into a drug treatment court, which is not open to the public or press. Wrote a solid 15+ articles on the subject for my country's national daily paper. Was interviewed by a PhD student studying the same thing for their dissertation. Was thanked profusely by the lawyers involved in the process (who are some of the most genuine lawyers I've ever met). Basically, everyone who knew anything about the subject was super stoked that it was getting coverage, and a lot of it.

Every article I wrote received little to no attention. The comments came in on the web version were derisory, often along the lines of: "Yeah, I'd fake being 'rehabilitated' as well if it meant getting out of jail."

I can't speak for other nations, but to me the problem is clearly with the public's perception of drug addiction. There is still the prevailing mentality that people do this to themselves, and they get what they deserve. Up until those articles I was as gung-ho about drug reform as you could get. After seeing how much the public actually cares, I've lost every last bit of optimism. My only hope is that enough countries begin taking such approaches, so countries like mine can see just how powerful this kind of rehabilitation can be.

 Betty probably said the same thing about her dog. 




 I've seen it matter firsthand working in a single industry for more than 10 years. You're not even out of high school.

There are times when diversity can be of value, and times where it's not needed. Saying point blank it doesn't matter just shows a total lack of understanding when it comes to workplace dynamics. 




  ...placing diversity over skill is clearly counter-productive to the bottom line.

How you managed to interpret the exact opposite of what I said is a miracle.

My point was only that diversity can be a positive thing when it's not prioritized above skill. 




 Why not? Having a gender diverse workplace is shown to have a number of advantages. If you have two equally skilled male and female candidates in a workplace that is largely comprised of men, there are plenty of reasons for why the female candidate would be a better option.  




 Not to be contrarian, but [workplace diversity does have its advantages.](http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/workplace-diversity-can-help-bottom-line-1007)

Obviously, placing diversity over skill is clearly counter-productive to the bottom line.

 wasn't just for you. I've had a few messages and there are other similarly themed comments to yours 




 Yeah... I get that my comment came across that way. But there are a lot of circumstances to my personal relationship and how it ended that has resulted in me being a lot more judicious with who invest myself emotionally in. No sense going into them, this isn't /r/relationships, but for clarity's sake it's not my trust in women that has gone specifically, it's the realization that the person I choose to give myself to wholeheartedly can at any given moment turn around and leave me with my dick in the wind. I doubt that person would ever be a man, so it's not a leap to say that relationship has left me wary of any woman I should want to spend my life with. 




 Mixed, but close enough. 




 Go ahead and check my post history. I'm all for remaining with England because of the advantages it offers us. Carry on. 




 Spoken like a true member of the Empire.

Since you clearly can't pick up on colloquialisms like "readins", I guess I have to explain.

Bermuda was settled by people on their way to settle in America. Therefor anti-British sentiment was strong circa 1775, since many of the people fighting in the Revolutionary War (sorry, "The War Of Independence" in your parlance) had close ties to Bermuda. Famous figures like John Rolfe, for example, had been wrecked in Bermuda (he even named his child with Pocahontas "Bermuda Rolfe.")

Seeing as those who settled in Bermuda did so for the same reasons the colonists settled in Virginia, it's only natural that they would side with their American brothers and sisters in their fight to gain independence.

Subsequently, we have attached our own dollar to the American dollar, become the darling of your biggest corporations, and underwritten the majority of your insurance. We are the oldest self governing colony in the British Empire, and have made shaky steps towards independence on a number of occasions, each push ultimately failing because no longer being a part of Britain would deprive us of valuable education and work opportunities both in the UK and the wider EU.

But what do I know, I'm just a Bermudian journalist with more than a decade worth of experience and research into Bermudian history to draw from.  




 It was more savage than that. Literally stopped responding to me when I lost my job.  




 Fuck. It's not a joke when this has actually happened to you. Completely erased my trust in women

 Well Muslims born and raised in the west usually ARE like every other muslim. Regular people.

The media is responsible for a lot of things, not least of which is the total confusion over what is going on within Islam right now. You're right in that it's helped spread xenophobia and racism and prejudice. I totally agree. You're right in that plenty of other religious groups have practiced the exact same things from time immemorial.

But Islam is in the middle of a massive ideological battle right now that is spilling over, costing hundreds of thousands of lives. Should talking heads be wondering on national television if the guy was a muslim? Of course not, if there's nothing to suggest that. Of COURSE that is wrong.

Is it prejudiced to wonder if a muslim who has carried out a violent attack was doing so in the name of Islam? No, because prejudice is by definition a pre-conceived notion not based on actual experience. If 20 people have been bitten by sharks off of one beach all summer, and a body washes up with chunks taken out of it, you're going to assume a shark did it.

EDIT: #notallsharks 




 1 + X = 2. Assuming X = 1 is not exactly rash.

It's not prejudicial to assume that if a Muslim commits an act of mass murder, especially in the West, it's usually in the name of ideology. And when it comes to killing people with planes, it's not like there isn't a history. It's irresponsible to use a label such as terrorist without knowing the motive, absolutely, but questioning whether an act of violence was ideologically motivated these days is only natural. 

Just to be clear, I lived for three years with kids from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. Some of the best friends I ever had. I'm not trying to shit on Muslims. Hell, the most devout Muslims I met were the most morally upstanding people I have ever come across.
 




 I'm one of those people. Worked in journalism from 16 onwards. Went to college. Realized in my first month that it would be way more beneficial to stay in the industry for three years instead of spending money on getting a 3-yr degree.

 Honestly, I love moments like this purely for the quick little glimpse it gives into a person's real nature. I live in a majority black country and grew up thinking all my white friends weren't racist. But over time, every now and then, one of them would let slip a moment like this, and I'm grateful every time. I don't say anything, just make a mental note, then slowly eek them out of my life.

EDIT: I'm not talking about wee little moments of prejudice, or politically incorrect views. I'm talking about flashes of outright racism. It's something I hate with the core of my being and it fundamentally changes my view of people to the point that I don't want to know them anymore.

 Being seen as a "trusted student" by a teacher the rest of the class dislikes puts that student at odds with their classmates, fostering distrust among their peers. In the hyper-social setting of a classroom, this can be severely detrimental to the student's social standing among the group. 

"This kills the ____" is a meme, in this case applied glibly to signify that such an action by the teacher would leave the "trusted student" figuratively "dead". 

In comedy, hyperbole is often used to "play up" a truth. In this instance, "This kills the student" is referencing the social strain being labeled a "trusted student" would induce. 

While one could have commented: "This would severely hamper the student's social standing among his peers", such matter-of-fact comments often go unnoticed on forums such as Reddit, where one-liners and popular references tend to generate more reaction and, in turn, karma.

 The only people that think women don't have issues in the US are men. 




 I'm really hoping you're a troll. Ignorance is not an indicator of intelligence. You have a flair for the kind of melodramatic rage that makes everyone think feminists are perpetually triggered cuntnuggets. 




 lolwut? 

"Feminist" work differs wildly from country to country, according to how much work is needed to be done for the rights of women IN that country. American feminism, as the average person sees it, looks like Tumblr. Turkish feminism looks like a woman beheading her rapist in the fucking street.  




 "American feminism" would imply feminism in America is different. 

"American feminists" implies feminist women in America are different. 




 I didn't know saying you complain about feminism = spouting off about feminism.

 All great advice until

 take the story to a sympathetic media outlet.

I hire a lot of freelancers. While I sympathise that you are working at an unethical company, I wouldn't trust you further than I could throw you if you quit your job because of the reasons you've listed then told another news outlet about it. Unless it's a story that has real value, like interns being forced to pay for rec letters, you'd be shooting yourself in the foot. 




 Please don't do that.

 Doubtful. It's one of my many pet names for him. Haz, Hazzy, Jazz Haz, Hazmat, Hazdribal, Hazilla, Hazim Zalabim, El Hazerino (if you're not into the whole brevity thing). Sometimes I just refer to the entire left side of the pitch as Hazpilicueta.

"Don't look like you're from around here."

No, just here for my sister's graduation.

 Not trivial at all, especially since the DP was [Shane Hurlbut.](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0403397/) So, not exactly like he's going to ruin the guy's career.

I've done really small time broadcast news, and I'd get super pissed if anyone, let alone the director of photography, was walking around in front of me during filming. Everyone knew not to do that. 

How the fucking DP of a major motion film doesn't know that is actually pretty astounding.

 He was fine, except that he kept trying to explain to the magistrate that he and his cousin (the owner) had sorted it out. The magistrate kept telling him if they had sorted it out, he wouldn't be here. That was hard for him to understand. Here's the article. http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20131113/NEWS02/131119909 




 That's much more succinct than I've been putting it. I hate this new trend of looking at the world like it should be a crime free paradise. Should the Ferguson kid have been shot? Of course not. Should he have obeyed the law? Of course. Did Charlie Hebdo deserve it? No. Should they have seen it coming? No shit. Should women get to wear whatever they want? Sure! Should women know wearing certain clothing will elicit certain responses? Fucking duh. 




 Court reporter here. Can confirm. Especially in plea court, these idiots are a dime a dozen. Once [wrote a story](http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20131113/NEWS02/131119909) on a guy who kicked in a restaurant's door because he had to pay $3.25 for some bacon.

 I figured as much re: their value. Not that I planned on selling them anyways. I suppose I should give my grandfather's book a go. I've read Spymistress and Intrepid, and I find his prose a bit jaunty. That, combined with his general habit of being an asshole when he was alive, has discouraged me somewhat.  




 I did notice that rule in the sidebar, but I hoped my question at the end on which book to read first would accomplish that. Is the current edit sufficient?  




 Not sure if this is allowed, but I don't really know where else to share it. Recently, while digging through the archives of my family's publishing company, I found a pile of old books by Robert Louis Stevenson, my ~great great great great grandfather.

No idea what they are worth, nor if anyone will find this interesting, but thought I would share.

 Hence why I said "good satire" specifically. And in order for there to be libel, the person would have to prove damages. 




 Exactly. After I left my job at my local national paper, I started a satire blog that people immediately began sharing thinking it was real. [This one,](http://thebermudalampoon.com/2015/02/27/michael-fahy-not-about-to-start-giving-a-shit/#more-192) about an appointed official (rather than elected) caused a 1000+ comment chain. 




 Good satire is taken seriously by LOTS of people. The former FIFA vice president, for example. Or even the OG satirist, Jonathan Swift. A Modest Proposal caused an uproar. 




 That's the most satisfying part of writing satire, when people think it's real. It's really the highest compliment. 




 That's kinda the nature of sketch comedy, [as expressed perfectly by the Mitchell and Webb Look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE_Glg85-60) 




 Journalist here. An indoor, private gym is most certainly not a public space, and therefor you cannot film without consent.

 I'm fine with spiders, cockroaches, junebugs, bats, sharks, you name it. Dolphins though? Fuck that. I'm convinced they're smarter than us, they just live a simpler life. 

I once volunteered at a dolphin experience place for a summer and had to go down with SCUBA gear to fix the fencing separating their enclosures. The 11 foot alpha named Khyber got hyper aggro and started jaw snapping at me. The shockwave shook my ribcage so much it felt like someone let off a grenade underwater.

They are terrifying animals. Nobody ever takes my phobia seriously, but I challenge anyone to get into a tank with a pissed off dolphin and tell me they didn't fear for their life.

(before people get on my back for working at such a cruel place, I was like 14 years old. I know now how awful it is to keep such amazing creatures penned in.)

 Popular posts on TIL have a very specific type. I love the idea of this sub because it's sort of a /r/mildlyinteresting version of it. You could put TIL in front of a LOT of factual posts on Reddit and it would work. 




 Journalist here. 

WE. DON'T. WRITE. THE. HEADLINES.

Feel the need to make that extra clear because every time there's a sensational headline, it's the author that gets blamed for it. 99% of the time we HATE the headlines our stories are given.

Call out the sub-editors, not the authors. 




 Teddy Roosevelt - the original hard-ass romantic. The duality between his inner suffering from his personal losses, and the person he projected to the world, are infinitely fascinating to me. 

He sorta had this need to assure and remind everyone of his heroism, but at the same time was aware of his own limitations and listened to what his heart told him. Rare you find those qualities in the same man. 




 Anderson Cooper is a stellar journalist. He fucked off to Africa in his teens IIRC (bankrolled by his family, but still...). He started in journalism by answering telephones, before he made a name for himself by forging his own press pass and getting into Burma to interview the students fighting the government. After that he began stringing from war zones all over the world.

He may not be a Marie Colvin, or a Philip Gibbs, but he's legit. I dont find any reason not to like the guy.

 STORY TIME!

Freshman year in high school, my buddy got a hand job from a girl named Davina. 

She basically clapped her hands around it and rubbed up and down like she was trying to start a fire with a stick and some tinder.

Thus 'Dolphina' was born. 




 Already spent on rum and hookers. Sorry. 




 That's not a bad idea, but it'd be damn near impossible to sell. I might give Elon a call though, just for good measure.

The Guardian has a long and storied history of breaking earth-shattering stories dating all the way back to when the Bolsheviks leaked documents exposing the Entente's imperial interests of WWI. That kind of history attracts supporters, so it's no wonder benefactors favour them. 




 The point is that reliance on advertising for revenue creates that conflict of interest. Hence the BBC. NPR would've been the same, and in fact started out the same IIRC.



 




 I love that people still expect separation of church and state in the media. Of course they banned their reporters from doing that. Of course, it's also wrong, but the public doesn't want to pay for news. Don't want to pay, don't expect the tenets that journalism once espoused to remain.

 Was really hoping this would be an America's Cup reference.

For those that don't know, the Brits invited the Americans to sail against them, with the Queen looking on.

America proceeded to detroy the British by a massive margin. Thus the "America's Cup" was born.

It would take almost 180 years before anyone else beat the Americans, when Australia did it in 1981 (I think.)

So... yeah, the Brits aren't too hot on sailing against the Americans.

 Thanks man. I really do appreciate it. This may or may not apply to you, but it's a life lesson I learned through a tragic example: never let stubbornness get in the way of your health. My dad was having bad heartburn but skipped his Dr appointment. A week later he died of a heart attack in a Texas hotel room. 




 He was working with the NY Times on the story, which he broke open, reporting for them and for the local daily here in Bermuda. The reporters he was working with got the award. He didn't.  




 Mine died when I was 12. Power-washed his grave today, then sat by his headstone with a 6-pack and bawled like I was 12 again. At 1130 am.

 You strike me as the type to make wild assumptions about strangers on the internet. 




 This fucking girl behind me wouldn't shut up during Jurassic World. Lost her shit when Claire went running from a T-Rex in heels. "HEELS? HAHAHAHAHA"

You're watching a movie with a T Rex in it and you're complaining that the protagonist has heels on?

 Fuck off you cadaverous little cumspitoon.  




 I get that. I was just making a joke. But it stands to reason that a person seeking out a park bench doesn't need to be told to run at that given moment. And that's kinda the point of ambient advertising. To deliver a message to people at a specific moment, where that message might be motivational, or aspirational, or just clever and helpful. The only specific moments I see arising from this are bedraggled workers looking for a bench to have their lunch on, only to find a benchless bench with Nike telling them run.  









 Jesus. Nobody is debating the relative ease of being a presenter vs construction worker in Qatar. I'm just saying it's a shitload harder than it looks, and it takes a lot of skill. 




 You can't commit a crime in retaliation for a crime, Sir Lightbulb. And get your shit together with those contradicting Z's and S's. 




 Pretty retarded if you ask me. What's the message here? Run instead of sitting down on a park bench? Those two activities have nothing to do with each other. I just want to eat my sandwich and enjoy some fresh air during my lunch break, not have some holier than thou shoe company tell me to fucking run. Run where? Back to my cubicle? Fuck you Nike. 




 I've seen fellas like you in court A LOT 









 It's not as simple as just reading your lines because the camera picks up your eyes moving. You have to look into the teleprompter and read with your peripheral vision. I invite you to give that a go without looking or sounding like a moron.  




 Or just ignore it and add assaulting a police officer to the charges. 




 Oh Heidi.... You tried, hun. You tried. 




 Former TV news presenter here. She deserves more than props. Karl throws her a segment ahead of time and she goes straight into it and delivers her lines straight into the camera, with only a brief glance at her script, before realizing the teleprompter is showing the script for different segment.

To break down the skill that involves: she's got her lede lines memorized, the composure to deliver them at any given moment without tipping the audience off, and the awareness to be reading the teleprompter, which would be showing Celeb Buzz's script, while delivering completely different lines.

There's a reason I'm a former TV presenter.... shit's HARD. 




 My home of Bermuda is famous for a few things: shorts, that 2spooky4me eponymous triangle, and tax avoidance. But the biggest mark our tiny archipelago has made in the history books can be found in every marina across the globe: [the Bermuda Rig.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_rig)

The rigging allowed us, and subsequently the world, to sail upwind with precision around the reefs that claimed so many ships in years gone by. The design was so transformative, within a few decades of its popularisation, King Charles II would soon be sailing one. 

A poem published by John H. Hardie in 1671 described Bermuda's boats such: 

 With tripple corner'd Sayls they always float, 
 About the Islands, in the world there are, 
 None in all points that may with them compare.

I've always been curious to know what the wider implications of the Bermuda Rig were in the world of sailing, beyond piracy and competition. Did the ability to sail upwind alter shipping routes, or naval war strategy?

I'd love to learn more about my island's sailing heritage, especially with the America's Cup World Series coming to our shores this October. 




 Wait what? How do you not see that the definition of harassment is what FPH was doing to Imgur staff? 




 FPH put pictures of the entire Imgur staff on their sidebar. That's pretty harassy

 My grandfather, William Stevenson, wrote the non fiction spy novel 'A Man Called Intrepid', which was subsequently turned into a TV miniseries starring David Niven. 

[On IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078649/companycredits?ref_=tt_dt_co) it says NBC was the US distributor, along with the list of production companies that made it, but I can't find anything on who has the film rights.

Can anyone point me in the right direction, or could someone with IMDB Pro have a deeper look at the film's details?

I'd very much like to look into reviving his book for the big screen, and I need all the help I can get! 




 Just curious to know where people are meeting women that display such "common" traits.

 Let's be honest here. 




 I used to rent mopeds to tourists. The number of people who put their feet out to somehow assist in braking is ridiculous. So many crashes. 




 Can't say I've ever encountered a girl that likes assaulting people, then specifically gets defensive when she gets assaulted back. You've met so many of these women, you can say confidently they're 1 in 15? Wow. You must come from a pretty shitty place if that's how people act. 




 It really annoys me when people bitch about product placement. Those brands funded a record breaking movie. A movie that you probably loved, although you'd never admit it here. Fuck them?  




 well pew pew to you too 




 Rosebud is his sled. The thing is, there was nobody at his bedside when he died. So how could anyone possibly know "Rosebud" was his last word? I never got that. 




 You need to hang around better women if you think that kind of behavior is "%100 typical" 




 I've always been curious to know whether it was the greatest, most skilled soldiers that survived the longest, or if your survival came down more to luck. If I am hell bent on surviving a battle, do I flee -- as the old idiom says -- or do I become as skilled as possible with my sword and mount? 




 Pretty sure this was on TIL recently. Mammal's distress calls are recognizable across species. So it's not so much that the scream is human, it's that human screams are mammalian.

 I mean, the Supreme Court HAS ruled that companies are people, and because money = free speech this now means that companies can support political candidates. I don't know anywhere else where this can be done.

I bet some hilarious shit went down. Horrible, horrible shit too. But also, occasionally... y'know, when someone isn't knocking down your gates threatening to rape all your women and erase all traces of you from the earth... I bet in between all... that... some funny shit went down. 




 Here's the thing...

 See the guy between Ali's legs? He was Sports Illustrated's top photographer at the time. The man who took this picture was new on the job, and would have been in the same spot, which was considered the best angle. He was told to go find his own spot on the ring. He did, and he got this picture. 




 No, it was totally because of his weight. Sleep apnea I think? 




 Not sure if there's a word for it, but my family does this all the time. My mom has started telling some of my stories like she was actually there. 




 Not in the slightest. There are far more extreme wings of the conservative party. That's not bias, that's a simple observation.  




 Compare it to the NYT, America's paper of record and a proven government mouthpiece... At least their bias is obvious. 




 Deadly groove: check.

Soulful white guy: check.

Joe Cocker 2 confirmed.  




 Except their morons are conservative morons, which are just like liberal morons but with an added dash of insanity.  




 I'm well aware of what they do and how they do it. I've been a journalist for ten years and have worked with them and CNN affiliates. My point is that their "news" is no different to other tv news channels in America. They're all inherently biased because they are all privately owned.  




 Exactly what I was thinking. What I hate about racing sims is not being able to quickly glance around. Oculus would do that perfectly  




 Did... did you ask him to read you a bedtime story? Because I would've asked for a bedtime story. 




 That's precisely what I mean. 




 Which is why I said they're no different to any other TV news station in America. MSNBC and CNN are just as guilty of that as Fox is. 




 Al Jazeera is one of the most respected news organizations in the world 




 That's exactly what I was saying. They give airtime to morons. Their actual reporters are sound. 




 Every time this comes up I defend Fox News and get downvoted to oblivion. It's their TALKING HEADS that are fucking retarded. Their news coverage is no different from any other TV news station in America. 




 TBH he probably stole it from another writer (I want to say Stephen King?) who used it as an example on how to create interesting short stories. The only difference to the short story example and the Purge is that in the short story idea, people were allowed to commit any crime as long as they compensated those who they committed the crime against.

 Went to school with his nephew actually. He got HEATED whenever you brought that video up hahaha 




 I work with one other full time employee publishing a magazine I can barely get out four times a year, and running a website. So not exactly six figures, although our office IS air conditioned. We run sponsored stories on that website because our audience demands they have free access to our content and advertisers have gotten wise to the fact that slapping a banner ad on a website isn't good business. And yet we get criticized for "duping" the customer.

I certainly don't like Bungie's model either, but I'm not going to criticize it just because they're making money in different ways to their competitors. If the market is willing to purchase those kinds of games, more power to Bungie. Consumers are morons. But I won't be buying it. Nor will you. Hopefully that sentiment is shared across the market and we can disincentivise game dev's from this brand of business. And if it all goes tits up, you can sit calmly on your high horse and say "I told you so." 




  The best product on the lowest possible budget. This is basic business.

You're not including deadlines, which play probably the most critical role. An indie dev team with a small budget and no deadline can spend as long as they want on a game. But if something goes wrong for a team working on a deadline, you have to sink more money into fixing that problem in order to meet the mark, putting you over budget.

 ...the rest of the industry has been able to finance their games without selling missions bundled with soft drinks, Bungie should be no exception.

Sounds pretty communist to me. A company finding an alternate source of revenue untapped by their competitors is unfair????

The bottom line of Bungie is not at hand here, the budget allocated to the game is. You don't know what that budget was, nor whether they were able to deliver the product within that given budget. If shit hit the fan, as I mentioned above, that could force the budget to skyrocket in order for them to meet their deadline. Bungie creates value for itself by creating video games, but they can't do that at a loss.

 This is not advertising.

You're definition of advertising is incredibly narrow. Perhaps the best word is "marketing". This is Red Bull. The way they go about marketing is radically different to everyone else. Other energy drinks would slap a COD logo on the can, certainly, but that is not and has never been Red Bull's strategy. Instead of slapping their logo on an F1 car, they created an F1 team. Instead of slapping Destiny's logo on their cans, they have exclusive content. It's pretty genius IMO.

 That's greedy

Is this communist Russia? This isn't communist Russia, is it?  




 So because other developers have done really cool stuff with a tiny budget, other developers should do that too? That doesn't make much sense, but ok. And how do you know it's not about funding the game? Can you provide a source for that, or are you just guessing because it looks like they're money grubbing whores?

If it wasn't for advertising, my industry would be dead because the money we make selling our product is JUST enough for us to make a new product every four months. That pain is shared by a LOT of others. 




 yeah, fuck those guys for finding additional funding for their game 




 You're a champ

 Have you sought counseling? My ex was a rape victim and had the opposite reaction to you, she felt disgusting during sex, like she was debasing herself. We went to therapy together and that helped her discuss and synthesize her feelings, which lead to a much more fulfilling sex life. More than anything the therapy just allowed her to talk about what she was feeling, and hear herself saying it, rather than bottling it all up in her head.  




 Thank you for your service

 One of my best friends is Christian. I can never argue about the negatives of religion with him because he's grown up in a house that embodies every positive aspect. His mother is a goddamn saint. Church every Sunday, constant community outreach, food drives etc. Grew up with him and his mom my entire life and she's never once mentioned God besides when they have grace at dinner. 

Point being, for many, religion is just a vessel in which valuable, noble traits can be delivered and instilled. If living a life like my friend's mom has lived is done in order to get into heaven, why worry? 




 Wow this sub is such a circle jerk. 




 I think Zouma is a captain in waiting. He's been referred to as France's future captain, so I see no reason why he can't eventually be ours. I fucking love the kid.

On another note, I'll be sad to see Mikel go but he could really lock down another team's midfield, and his talents are wasted on the bench. If Schneiderlin leaves Soton, I think he'd make for a great replacement. Obviously not in terms of playmaking, but I've always rated him for his ability to shut down a midfield. He's a beast, and I'd love to see him do well on another team with regular starts. 




 It goes to show you how fickle Hollywood can be though. Here's a girl that has been stunning in every film she's been in since Leon, and yet three shitty but high grossing films nearly derailed her career. 




 Yeah, I misremembered the article I read. It was Cold Mountain that gave her career new life. Linked to the article in my original comment. 









 The films nearly ruined Portman's career, lest we forget. She had faded into obscurity until ~~Black Swan~~ Cold Mountain, and the only reason she got that role was through a lot of connections going to bat for her. Everyone in Hollywood had written her off directly because of Star Wars.

EDIT: Cold Mountain, not Black Swan.

 You have to agree to share, first off. I live in Bermuda and have a dock. There's a couple that lives on a houseboat in the bay and they use it without permission all the time. I was actually on it flying my friend's drone around and they just walked past me and loaded up their dinghy like it was nothing. I told them it was a private dock, and that they could use it this one time. They've since teared the ass out of it and are using it all the time, disrupting the guests that pay $600 per night for our vacation rental cottage. I've spoken to them at least a dozen times about it and yet they continue to use it, leaving bags of doritos, beer bottles, etc floating in the mangroves by my slip. I've since called the police, had them charged for mooring without a license and trespassing.

In other words, don't use people's shit without their permission. And if you give a moose a muffin, he'll ask you for some milk. Far better to lay down the law and not let people use your shit.

 My thoughts exactly 
























 Slowly but surely I've seen popular posts on /r/MensRights et al. go from content that affects men, to childish bitchfests about double-standards and anti-feminist circlejerks.

I just want a sub where I can read and discuss issues that affect men without it devolving into abject rage about the opposite gender. Fuck me, right?

I've created /r/Brohan for the interim, if anyone is interested.

Otherwise, I'd love to know where I can go to vent my frustrations as a man in a forum that doesn't throw a hissy fit every time women are mentioned. 




 Leave a comment if you'd like to help grow the Kingdom of Brohan.

 I've called it /r/Brohan, after Middle Earth's Rohan, the Kingdom of Men. Thanks for the idea.

 I lived in Camden for a year as well. Right near Mornington Crescent.

1. Got mobbed by screaming teenage girls coming out of the Tesco right by Koko. Turns out I was walking next to Oly Murs, and they thought I was famous too. I wasn't.

2. Great place to meet random people. I'd go out with some American buddies of mine and we'd inevitably end up back at my flat with a few people to do copious amounts of whatever drugs we had on us. 

3. Once saw a muslim man getting dragged down a dark alley, screaming for his life. Called 999, but the guy let the muslim man go when he saw me on the phone. 

4. Great place for picking up women. Especially Aussie women, for some reason. Maybe they're just easy.

 There are usually clauses in such termination contracts that prevent the employee from speaking about the nature of their termination. I was very surprised to see that AMA, so it's no surprise it's been taken down now, probably by him.

 I feel like more credit should go to Chris whenever this is mentioned. Everyone blames Anderson for clowning, but against any other fighter he would've been able to slip his way out of that. Chris NAILS him with 5 straight off balance punches. That's next level accuracy and power. 




 Bermudian here. He is a total nutjob, but the fish you're holding has been a part of that dive pretty much since it's inception. Can't remember his name, but he has one, and he's doing just fine. We've been worldwide leaders in conservation since we first protected the green turtle in 1620. Touching a few snapper isn't going to hurt anyone, and in fact the only reason that snapper is still around is because the area you dove in is protected against fishing. If I had a friendly snapper come up to me like that anywhere else, you'd be damn sure he wind up with a spear through his gills. 




 I actually worked with this dive company for a summer. Lived in Bermuda my whole life. We are miles ahead of the world when it comes to marine protection. We first protected turtles in 1620 and have always had strict catch limits. The fish OP is holding has been a part of that dive since it first started. Nothing's ever happened to it. 




 Literally JUST posted about this same thing! Horses know their way home. 




 There's actually an old story in my country of two brothers and their horse. Every weekend they'd go to one of the hotels with all the American women, get wasted, then climb back into their carriage and fall asleep. Every time, they'd wake up back in their driveway, and give the horse the day off. 




 ... you take the chains off. 




 Unfortunately all of that is wayyyyyyy outside our budget :(

 Awesome, thanks for your thoughts. Oracle has two boats down here right now.

 You go right ahead and try and teach a class of children how to fuck without being decapitated by angry fathers. 




 just because you don't know where to look for quality journalism doesn't mean it doesn't exist. read a newspaper. pick up a magazine. the majority of people in my field take their jobs extremely seriously, and while the talent varies, the desire to do our job properly is first and foremost. 




 Not quite. Never went to college. Worked my whole life as a reporter. 




 The "one man band" you're describing is a new role in news, but that's by no means the typical journalist these days. Grunts get sent out on that stuff. 




 Contrary to popular belief, the majority of journalists take their job very seriously.  




 I will be starting a new series with a newspaper on the America's Cup, and I was wondering what the fans would like to see in terms of media coverage. 

Because of my connections with the people involved, from the sailors to the administrators, I'm uniquely placed to offer really good coverage on what's going on with the 2017 America's Cup, and everything leading up to it.

So what would be of the biggest interest to you? High quality videos? Interviews? Analysis? History? Gossip? I'd love your two cents!

 Yesssss. Good. Let the peasantry flow through you

honestly though, I feel like this might be the one and only time I as a console gamer can feel just a litttttttle bit superior. I maybe game 4 hours a week normally. This weekend I had a booze fuelled coke fest with my buddies playing Batman and it's INCREDIBLE.

 I dunno, it's pretty disappointing he won't come out as gay. Everyone in Hollywood knows. It's no secret.

  "rage trance" isn't an excuse.

Sure, but a mental health condition might be. Or brain damage. Have you ever seen a video of a person acting like this? There's usually some logic to people's actions, at least fuzzy logic. This type of attack makes no sense.  




 That made me think it was more than just road rage. It's like he's coming out of a rage trance. The guy at the end of the video seemed to know him as well, and was treating him gently, like he's seen it before. I don't know if outright rage is symptom of any behavioral or psychological issues, but I wouldn't be surprised if this guy has had these kind of moments before. And that's not normal. 




 This is the best description I've ever read....... Spot. Fucking. On. 




 I feel the need to point out it's the Muslims that are violent towards UK soldiers. 




 Coincidentally, the man who led the gunpowder plot, Sir Henry Tucker, is my ancestor. If it wasn't for the Continental Congress going back on our deal to give you all our gunpowder in exchange for the lifting of a trade embargo, we'd be American today, instead of... *shudder*... British. 









 Non American chiming in here. Not only are Americans good hosts in America, they're good hosts outside of America as well. The British are awful when it comes to socialising. Americans (and Canadians) will be your best friend for the day just because you ordered their favourite beer. They'll strike up a conversation with you about golf because you wear a Calloway hat. I went to boarding school in the US and the number of friends I've made outside of America based solely on the school I went to is astounding.

You guys were my saving grace when I was living in England.

 Shit. There's no context. The thread was asking girls what was the most arbitrary reason they've ever chosen to have sex with a guy. 









 No, I dont like it because you presume your link to wikipedia completely nullifies the entire argument of the article. Which it doesn't. 




 Dammit. I was so ready to mount my high horse and pretend I wasn't the least bit worried when they rejected me back in my uni days. 




 No offense, but I feel like Bernie's endorsements is a game of "People That Don't Matter" Bingo.

 THe annoying part is that GallowBoob is actually a really good looking guy. He posted a pic of himself in his sub, IIRC. And this is coming from a man normally petty enough to denigrate other men sheerly for their better looks. 




 You're totally right. A simple link to wikipedia is far better than writing an intensely well researched article in the New Yorker, a known rag for shills and pansy liberals. A tip of the hat to you, good sir. You've bested Ms Lepore.

 Oh I dont bother with the comments. I have loads of other sources but I use it to make sure I don't miss anything big. 




 THere's a vast difference between the original and modern interpretation of the 2nd Amendment. It wasn't until a republican did a "history" on the amendment in the 50s/60s IIRC that people began interpreting it as "the right to have a gun". Up until then it was known as the Forgotten Amendment, because it was solely to do with the people's rights to "bear arms" against a tyrannical government.   




 Power does corrupt though. They've done studies.

 Kinda like Shadow, Chance, and Sassy...

^^^I'm ^^^sorry 




 Here's the thing... 




 I'm sure it's awesome sitting on a high horse demanding companies do what you say without paying them. You can't have ethics in journalism when your primary customer is advertisers. As I said in another comment, I run a tiny regional magazine and I've had advertising pulled for writing a bad review, putting me in the red for the quarter. What do you propose I do? Keep writing bad reviews until my company files for bankruptcy?  




 I'm a journalist and I keep tabs open on rising submissions in /r/worldnews and other news subs. So technically Redditing IS working. 




 /r/retiredgif  




 Finding it hard to breathe up there on your high horse? I don't disagree but fucking hell you have to love yourself to quote yourself. Get a life. 




 More talking about the whole of KiA. I've posted here before trying to explain this, but nobody wants to listen. 




 Gaming journalism is probably bottom rung on the ladder of importance for the Guardian or TIME. They're far more concerned with making money so that they can insure their journalists in war zones, buy new equipment, offer competitive salaries for new hires etc. Clickbait pays for that by pageviews, upping the value of advertising on their site.

That could EASILY be done away with if people started paying for news on the internet like they do for newspapers. But people don't want to pay.

I run my own magazine. I've written bad reviews of restaurants and had them pull their advertising, putting me in the red for the quarter. Trust me, nobody likes doing it, but it's the only way to survive right now.

I wish people understood that instead of getting on their high horses and braying about stuff they aren't remotely familiar with.  




 They aren't selling shit. You're the ones that demand FREE content. If the internet was willing to pay for news, there might be reason to uphold ethics in the name of journalism. Unfortunately, many have to scrape to survive, in which case appeasing advertisers becomes the primary objective. 




 HA! That's my uncle's name. And his nickname is Mad Dog!

 I mean, Reddit DID do it. You can't pretend the shitparade over Pao had nothing to do with her resignation.  




 What it looks like is the whole of reddit was moving toward something Victoria was not comfortable with, if rumors are to be believed. Pao as the face would naturally take the heat, but there's nothing to suggest it was her decision alone to move Reddit in whatever direction it was that Victoria disagreed with 




 "resignation" could very well mean "dethroned by the board"

 Wait. Is there talk of Magnusson not staying in F1? 




 People get pissed because I admit to speeding on a motorcycle, gettings lots of tickets etc. I may not obey the rules of the road to a tee, but I'm 1000x more aware of what I'm doing than a teenage girl going 10mph below the speed limit listening to James Blunt in the AC and texting her friends. 




 My godmother is in charge of putting together the Vanity Fair Oscar parties every year. I've been 3 times. That's her. Nothing fake about it. You're probably just a bit peeved such a beautiful, talented woman actually happens to act like a regular person.  









 I am suffering serious cuddle withdrawal after breaking up with my gf. So yes. Yes, cuddles are needed. 




 It still takes a shitload of work to develop a compelling story from Campbell's work, but I'm not sure I'm ready to believe it was Lucas alone who developed it. I was a script reader with BBC and I saw plenty of great monomyth structured stories that were trashed for their ambition alone. Core concepts were good, great even, but had such a large scope it wouldn't be financially viable, even with the Lotto money GBR uses to fund British film.

 I've never heard anyone echo my feelings about HD vanilla so perfectly. Come to my bed. Bring HD vanilla and famous amos cookies.

 This is 1000000x worse without the YIPSKIDDLEDOOOO and the terrified kid yelling at his wasted dad 




  We live in (at least in the West) a society where any time a man does something against a woman it is given far too much attention... it helps to show that both genders are equally capable of doing horrible things and that it isn't just men doing it.

Any rational person knows this. MensRights is more than welcome to have that end of the market about male issues. I, and many others, don't need constant reminding that people can be cunts regardless of gender.

 When new people come to the sub, they tend to vent a lot because they're not used to having a place to talk about the things they experience.

For this exact reason, the sub has done more harm than good, as that venting has evolved into a weird conspiracy that feminism is actively trying to suppress male issues and vice versa. The reactionary women-bashing by some has become a trademark, not just on reddit, but in the media as well. One can vent without perpetuating the idea that men concerned with male issues are diametrically opposed to female issues.

 they're talking about the double-standard that an athlete is going through because he was assaulted and had the audacity to hit a woman back after she kicked and punched him

Again, another thing I believe does more harm than good. "Equal rights and equal lefts" is massively popular. I think the manly thing to do when a (presumably weaker) woman assaults you is to restrain her instead of punching her.  




 I have! Last I checked I had a top 10 post on there hahaha. I feel, though, there's less focus on issues that affect men, and more focus on man stuff. Which is great, obviously. 




 Unfortunately I feel a distinct separation from that sub these days. When I first got on Reddit it was awesome, but it's become associated with values I actively dislike. The top posts usually have something to do with injustices perpetrated by women against men, and I just don't feel those are the things that deserve much attention.

I love women. I love feminists. Not the kind that go to Tumblr to conduct their slacktivism, but women who break gender stereotypes or devote their careers to causes beyond teaching "Women's Studies". One of my best friends, a volunteer abortion clinic defender, hates that stuff as much as I do. 

I want a place that recognizes the difference between working to better their respective gender, and a place that bitches about the problems affecting their gender. I'm not sure /r/mensrights qualifies at this point. Two years ago it certainly did. Notsomuch these days.

EDIT: literally just checked /r/all and there's a top post from /r/mensrights about how female models make more than male models. EXACTLY what I'm talking about.  




 Cheers brother! And thanks for being the first to post. Hopefully we can help this sub grow and find like-minded redditors.  




 hahaha cheers.

"KNIGHTS OF BROHIRRAM, MOUNT UP!" was my battle cry whenever I had nights out with the boys. Seemed only natural. 




 Unfortunately I don't have friends like that. I have plenty of guy friends, just none I feel comfortable discussing my issues with. Not that I mind, but I get called a faggot just by having a glass of wine. We're brutal to each other, which is fun at the right time, but doesn't exactly foster a trusting environment.  




 I really like this sub. It's just only for asking questions. You can't post content here.
