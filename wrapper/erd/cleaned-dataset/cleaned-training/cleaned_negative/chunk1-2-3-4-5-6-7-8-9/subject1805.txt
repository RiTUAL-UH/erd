 Everyone with a soul is my friend. Nearly everyone else who died during it has come back so we can hope and pray for the return of Nova Prime 




 Think you would really like the whole marvel cosmic run by Abnett and lanning. It starts with annihilation and goes up to the thanos imperative. It features the guardians of the galaxy and that run is the basis of the film apparently, also nova, Quasar, silver surfer and galactus plus more of marvels heavy cosmic hitters. It is excellent. There is a post that has the reading list, I'll try and see if I can find it.

As also mentioned Silver Surfer Requiem is brilliant. Also Thor god of Thunder is absolutely superb, brilliant story and stunning artwork 




 Nova the Richard Rider version because he is the greatest hero of all time and silver surfer for marvel. For DC I would go with Flash and Martian Manhunter 




 In the marvel comics done by Abnett and lanning, the fault is a giant tear in time and space that is caused by the t-bomb set off by Black Bolt who is leading the inhumans and the kree during the war against Vulcan who leads the Shi'ar. This is then what allows the cancerverse into our universe. It also causes the marvel universe to lose it greatest hero. RICH RIDER REPRESENT!!!!

 Felt completely disconnected from the world, things I loved like sport, my friends, videos games, movies etc didn't matter. Hated myself more than i usually did and felt suicidal, not god I wish I was dead but I went and bought rope and was getting everything ready for when I did it. Told my friend and she pretty much went off on me for keeping it a secret and not telling anyone, told me she would be there for me and help out and convinced me to go to the doctors. Was on tablets for about a year and have been off them for about 5 months now and feel like a new man. Still feel shit somedays but it's a hell of a difference to what I was like. 




 Dad's an alcoholic who used to beat me so never really wanted to continue in his path. Feels great to be judged by people when out though as if someone not drinking is fucking well weird and I'm a compete freak for not partaking.

 Not exactly a brilliant caper in regards to money stolen and things like that but I remember a story of a gang digging a massive underground tunnel to steal a cash machine from a blockbuster.

 Tunnicliffe was touted as a rising star, not to the level of Pogba but people thought he would be able to do a job for us as a destroyer which we were sorely lacking in at the time. 

I don't know how many matches until he proved his worth because I don't watch Juve that often but as someone who goes to about 80% of our youth and reserve games (at home) I can tell you Pogba didn't deserve to be getting games for the first team. He got put in because of his complaints and when that happened didn't actually do anything to cement himself as a first teamer. We couldn't give in to him otherwise every youth player would do it like is happening now with us and pereira who once again is playing for the reserves and feels he deserves to play for the first team and won't sign a new contract but he doesn't deserve to be in the first team as he is playing quite average himself but no doubt if he leaves and starts playing well then it will be the usual "oh United made a huge mistake"

You argue obviously he was ready but with Juve he is in a midfield 3 where as with us he was in a 2 so maybe that's why he couldn't shine with us, maybe that's why he was able to look so good for you because he plays in a formation we never would have usually under fergie

He wanted a chance that's true but he can't just say he wants a chance and then continue to be bang average playing against people that were inferior to him, he should have been tearing people apart to prove he was ready

Also don't know who's down voting you and don't really no why, you're just putting your opinion across 




 Then he should have played better for the reserves that year instead of just moaning about not playing, the year before he alongside a youth team that consisted of Morrison, tunnicliffe, keanes etc won the fa youth cup. Pogba played well for us in that but still wasn't our best player in the kids hat year, tunnicliffe rivalled him in midfield and Morrison was the standout. The next year (where he complained about not starting) he was absolutely average for the reserves playing poorly at times and just doing enough so why would we play him when he wasn't putting any effort in? Tunnicliffe was playing better and we didn't play him either and he wasn't signing a new contract so why play him? The times he did come in the first team he didn't set the world alight and yes he was only off the bench but he still had time to try something and he didn't do anything 




 After the great battle of the wounded knee massacre a lot of towns knew that there would be trained soldiers who would need a new job after being kicked out of the military due to severe knee injuries, so they contacted the empire to try and get a job for them with health benefits that included things like physio. This offer looked good to the returning soldiers and boosted the economy and the towns now had trained soldiers protecting them. 

Why that battle targeted knees however is still a mystery...

EDIT - Sorry the source is my friends dad called Thorin who was at the great battle of the wounded knee massacre and is now a guard in Riften 




 Which God? Several Gods?

Was it Gorr the God Butcher? 




 Wahey. He was handing a check over as he had raised about 25 grand for the hospital. 




 Met Michael Owen when he came to our work (I work at Manchester Royal) and that was ok, seemed a bit dull and like he couldn't be bothered. 

Then met The King Denis Law as well and he was amazing kept me talking about football, got pictures with him and just an all round great bloke and a pleasure to talk too 




 I don't know what he would learn, I'm just giving an opinion. I'm basing my claims on the fact the finding stuff out in 6 months would be easier than 3 so he could have more chance of exploiting weaknesses 




 Would give him more time to get better materials, maybe research supes a bit more and find out about red sons etc. 3 months he might scratch the surface of these but an extra 3 would be a lot better

Irwin - ROI

Ronaldo - Portugal

Bobby Charlton - England

Ryan Giggs - Wales

Best - Northern Ireland

Cantona - France

Law - Scotland


Just going with one from each country for a team, had to make sacrifices like Irwin in over Keane who is obviously the best player we have had from ROI 




 The 94th time we have signed him in the last 4 years 




 Jesus my memory is better than I thought, good find  




 Last I heard and this was about 5 years ago it would cost about 114 million quid to go over the railway. They've said repeatedly it's not feasible at the minute but think it's because it would affect attendance for a bit so they don't want too yet 




 We have been chronically underfunded for years so we needed some heavy reinvestment, you can't expect brand new players to come in and settle straight away as you know. We got destroyed last year, had pretty much our whole back line leave and got a new manager with a completely new play style. This year was just bedding in, we got the minimum that we set out for, it's disappointing of course but after last year I'm happy 




 In all fairness city came 9th in 07/08 then spent 125 mil in the summer and then finished 08/09 in 10th so wouldn't really be talking if I were you but I'm sure you know that was all building blocks for the club as ours is. 




 No it was Liverpool fans last year when they looked set for the title after City 




 Fellaini, Duncan Ferguson etc I want to play football not get the shit kicked out of me 




 Kevin Bacon 




 Supermans first flight in man of steel, it just makes me smile like a child and makes me really happy 




 Went to school with him, he was so much better than everyone else and we all thought we were the dogs bollocks. He's a top lad and is a great laugh and hope he is doing alright with everything, it's absolutely shit when something like that happens 




 I was thinking about that myself but I'm going with the experienced head, that and the fact my grandad loved Byrne and said he was our true captain and could play anywhere himself 




 Pretty much what you said, watch the original trilogy then move onto the prequels. After that you can watch the clone wars which will fill in a bit more for you and marvel are currently doing some comics to add more story. There will also be a book released in a couple of months with more story between the end of 6 and start of 7 




 Bioshock or Mass Effect 




 Schmeichel, Roger Byrne at LB, Ferdinand, Bruce, Irwin at RB, Keane, Robson, Charlton, Ronaldo, Best, Law

 Silver Surfer Requiem is a brilliant story 




 Your all time is not great, should be best, charlton and then argued between law, robson, keane 




 Sucker Punch, brilliant soundtrack for a sadly rubbish film 
























 Why do you hate him? 




 Yeh completely understand and I can't be arsed with it all either, would love to just skip to the start of the season. I'm confident we will have a good summer though, everyone is on holiday, give it another week/two and reckon we will see it all start clicking into place  




 Just quite confident that we will get him, can't really explain why I am but I think because a lot of players are on holiday that's why nothing is happening and being said that seems like it's on the cusp 




 My Man!!! Didn't even know, definitely getting it now as a birthday treat to myself 




 The rumours did come from seemingly nowhere but Canal+ or whoever there sport channel that tweeted it seemed certain we were in for him, have a feeling LVG would like him and sees him as an ideal Carrick replacement as well 




 Probably schneiderlin I reckon is the most likeliest at the minute. Dunno who we are targeting for RB now 




 Fowler, McManaman, Beglin etc 




 Dan Abnett and Andy Lannings Nova run especially now with the movies starting to show a bit more of the cosmic side 




 I know, it's a damn shame. My grandad said he was confident of us scoring whenever Law had a chance  




 I've posted before about meeting The King on here and I'll just say it all again he was amazing, kept me talking about football, got pictures with him and just an all round great bloke and a pleasure to talk too and spend some time with. 

My grandad always goes on about him, Best, Charlton, Byrne etc but when he talks about the holy trinity he gets a glint in his eyes and you can still see the wonder. He says he's the greatest striker he's ever seen play football not just for United and my grandad has watched a lot over the years. He had it all according to him and could do everything you wanted in a striker, he is The King 




 Yep Real doing what they do best 




 Oh of course they are pricks, I know he's leaving but can't be arsed with a new story every day with nothing in it till he leaves 




 Them and Real leaking loads of shit to their mouth pieces 




 Then they can do that and shut up this year 




 Well having no defence until December is a tad troublesome... 




 The amount of stuff he posts he's bound to get ones right, a week or so ago he said Dani Alves was ready to go to PSG and the contract was done and then Alves came out and said PSG was never an option and Blanc denied everything 




 And a lot of United fans wished Ronaldo all the best and still do, it's all down to the manner in which they are leaving 




 Roy Keane, his performance against Juve after knowing he won't be playing in the champions league final was astonishing, dragged us to the final. 
























 Telegraph isn't paywall unless for people outside the UK it is 




 Good to see an actual professor state that even though so much was wrong he still enjoyed the film. If only the professors on reddit were able to do the same about other films... 




 He was ok at the World Cup but everyone else playing for England were shite. It's not like he performed near the level Ferdinand was playing at either. Ferdinand was at the heart of the defence of a Leeds team that got to the semis in the champions league, it was of course a lot of money but he was worth it 




 And when he cost that much he had performed at a World Cup and in the champions league 




 Yeh that one player...loads that 




 Danny Ings reminds me of a dwarf 




 Thought Nasri was off as well? 




 3 sick 7 me mate 




 Are you joking? 




 I like falcao but just look at the Spurs game, he missed about 3 that should have been goals just in that 




 Happily 




 Me too 




 Happily fuck off mate 




 Nerves maybe? Apprehension, just because he's the best doesn't mean he wouldn't feel them. Going out in front of 90 thousand and being expected to perform could do that to you 




 They are the equivalent of The Sun on radio, bullshit and banter merchants 




 Best thing you can do is try and catch Copa America games to see what he's like 




 Bebe scored a couple of worldies as well and would look good in a YouTube video. Not saying Firminho is Bebe because he is of course a good player but can't go off YouTube videos 




 Yet Evra is hated more than the average United player 
























 We genuinely couldn't give a fuck about losing him on a free, keeping him this year would be worth more than what you are offering 




 Critters? Sounds similar can't remember the clown but not seen it for a while 




 Fair play to him  




 Thank you for 20 RVP and for giving Fergie the perfect send off 




 What the fuck is CMV? 




 No they aren't  




 Yeh we will definitely sell for a big loss after one season 




 He can still be a professional about it instead of act like a cunt, imagine if he was a member of your staff or someone on your team. I'm a united fan so couldn't give a fuck but he's still acting like a prick 




 Jesus what a little wankstain 




 After he has picked a pug and gets asked why

"It's a bulldog innit?"

Kingsman 




 I watch other leagues and couldn't give a fuck who wins, it gives me true enjoyment as I'm a neutral who gets to watch great games but couldn't care less about specific teams 




 No because it's weird

Haha at bandwagoners downvoting me, I'm sure you support all the better teams in the different leagues because you feel a real "connection" with the teams 




 He was only 20 then in all fairness so maybe couldn't adjust that well but since then he's been all over with the national team so he might be ok now 




 Trust me mate he's painful at times because you know he can be an absolutely brilliant fucker but instead he just causes you physical pain  




 He has but he will never kick on, he will have a game where he looks like a world beater and you think fuck me what a player we have and then he will be absolutely abject for the next 6 games and you'll want him benched and then he will have a great game and then be fucking abject for 6 games etc etc time is a flat circle yadda yada 




 You are right, he is too inconsistent. It's not so much bad work ethics I genuinely just think he has a bit of a mental block when it comes to taking the next step, he always seemingly sabotages himself by doing something stupid/infuriating 




 We've no idea how well he will do 




 Yyyeeessss finally!!!!! Can't believe he is finally leaving and getting off our wage bill.

He was great in 2010-11 and one of the best in the league but fuck me he is probably the most frustrating cunt I've ever had to watch and I've had to watch a lot of them  
























 Look at the base of his thumb and you see bad bruising, add the bandage down the arm and would say he has an injury so pointless taking him to America when he wont play so let him stay at home and work on fitness 




 Cole vs Antonio Valencia though wasn't for some reason 




 Individual awards like team of the year are a load of shite, David Luiz got in world team of the year. He is brilliant though and will be remembered as one the greatest England has ever produced  




 That was good old dithering Dave thinking he wasn't strong enough for the league in the end

Can you also show me where he said it was a done deal? 




 Ronaldo 




 Trust me schweinsteiger is absolutely amazing and I genuinely still can't believe it but think it will be bigger than him  




 We will go for one massive thing which if it comes off would be huge 




 What do you mean wasn't going to be on the books this year? As in if we hadn't got him we wouldn't have spent the money, correct but we did so us now not spending the money is us saving it 




 Hahahahahahaha  




 Hahahahahahaha 




 Stopping us wasting money as you put it is still saving money as it is expenditure we aren't now using, before falcao came we lost vida, Ferdinand and evra who probably earned that amount so his wage was just money we had spent anyway so all in all yeh we are saving money. 




 I work at Manchester royal hospital and we generally use purple and clear bags for bloods, but the guy could literally have just grabbed a bag and used it 




 Yeh because he's saved us another 250 grand a week wages you weird bell, so he was shit it happens but with him, RVP and Nani gone that about 600 grand a week saved 




 Add falcaos wages to that as well... 




 The article is a load of shit, apparently he told all this to a Milan fan who met him at Wimbledon who remembered everything fergie said perfectly and then told tuttosport 




 We would not take a 20 million hit after one season, not a chance 




 I've read a lot of shit in my life, but this right here is the fucking biggest steaming pile I've ever had the displeasure of letting my eyes witness. Day can only get better I suppose 




 It's a midfield 3  
























 Oh of course not but Fabian will more than likely still say it 




 If this actually does happen expect stuff like "Christian was my mate, I thought he was staying, there was a lot of broken promises" etc

The usual shite really 




 It's his release clause 




 Yeh we definitely should have spent 32.5 million on someone who will sit on the bench, definitely. Also for people who will comeback with Di Maria he was bought to be a starter not sit on the bench it's just not working out at the minute where as benteke wouldn't displace Rooney 




 Because he was only on loan and still a United player, save that for when he gets a permanent move not when United still own him 




 Cool 




 No shit 




 Same  




 But we literally have nobody like schweinsteiger, we lost vidic, Ferdinand, evra, scholes, giggs (on the pitch) so quickly that we don't really have any leaders, we have Rooney who can drive us on but he isn't a leader in the mould of a Keane, Vidic or schweinsteiger  




 Yeh 




 England. No, they are inconsistent, seemingly don't actually care about the football being played or the fans one iota, easily bullied and just seem like bell ends 




 We aren't going to sign him 




 I only post on mobile, United  




 Now they just have to sign him off us, Real and Arsenal according to the Chilean media 




 AD the Dutch paper 




 I'm assuming she told you to keep your foot raised and keep pressure on it and get out of her house and go to a hospital  




 http://imgur.com/3Ad0rD4

Should hopefully see the discolouration now 




 Yeh he has the white strapping but I wasn't talking about that, note the brown bandage underneath that further down the arm
