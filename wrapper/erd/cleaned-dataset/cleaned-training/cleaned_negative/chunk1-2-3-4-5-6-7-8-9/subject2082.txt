 Isn't that a very closed-minded, unfair and naive way of rating movies? For example, a movie without any actors or a silent movie without music would for example score 0 on acting and/or sound design automatically? 




 La femme qui se poudre (1972). 




 I use a scale from 1 to 5 to rate movies, so a perfect score is 5/5 for me. Here are the 26 movies that I've given the highest score possible:     


* Banshun (1949)     
* Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956)       
* Smultronstllet (1957)     
* Jalsaghar (1958)     
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959)    
* Pickpocket (1959)   
* Le trou (1960)    
* La notte (1961)     
* L'eclisse (1962)    
* Nattvardsgsterna (1962)       
* Sanma no aji (1962)         
* Tystnaden (1963)      
* Suna no onna (1964)     
* Andrey Rublyov (1966)     
* Tanin no kao (1966)      
* C'era una volta il West (1968)    
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)      
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)      
* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)      
* Solyaris (1972)     
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)  
* Zerkalo (1975)      
* Stalker (1979)       
* Krhozat (1988)        
* Der siebente Kontinent (1989)    
* Stntang (1994)      




 It's far from one of my favourites, but it's indeed a good movie. One of Philip Seymour Hoffman's best performances. 




 It is! Quite good and gritty with a nice soundtrack. 




 I wouldn't care. 




 But then again, Iranian films overall have really bad distribution from the start. All of the movies I mentioned have at least been released on DVD. 




 Yeah, the best one of them all. Solyaris (1972) by Tarkovsky. 




 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Solyaris (1972). They're also way better in my opinion. 




 Five of my favourite Iranian movies:   

* Jodaeiye Nader az Simin (2011)   
* Khaneh siah ast (1963)   
* Nema-ye Nazdik (1990)  
* Nun va Goldoon (1996)   
* Ta'm e guilass (1997)   


Five other Iranian movies really worth seeing:    

* Avaze gonjeshk-ha (2008)   
* Ayneh (1977)     
* Gaav (1969)    
* Sib (1998)   
* Ten (2002)   

Kiarostami's Koker trilogy is of course a must see too, but I tried not to only name movies by him. But be sure to watch Nema-ye Nazdik (1990) and Nun va Goldoon (1996), those two are great gems from Iran. Nun va Goldoon (1996) is also directed by Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Samira Makhmalbaf's father. 




 I've seen it. Not that horrible, but too thin, simple and a bit superficial for me to like it more. I got the feeling that the movie wanted to be too much at the same time. 




 It's not really one of the top choices for me at all when it comes to what I want Criterion to release. I would rather see a release of Gummo (1997) then. 









 Your choices are not bad. My list would probably look like this:     

1. Spalovac mrtvol (1969)       
2. Les yeux sans visage (1960)       
3. Possession (1981)     
4. Onibaba (1964)       
5. Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)      




 Two-Lane Blacktop (1971). 




 Mulholland Dr. (2001). 




 Hiroshima mon amour (1959), 90 minutes of perfection. 




 Tanin no kao (1966), Stalker (1979) and Solyaris (1972). 




 Hiroshima mon amour (1959). 




 Dead Man (1995), his best one. 









 Solyaris (1972) of course. 




 Stalker (1979). 




 Andrey Rublyov (1966) and Marketa Lazarov (1967) are both amazing in their realism. Both of them are dealing with a main character each, but they also portray rivalry. The first one dealing with the fighting between rival princes and the Tatar invasions, while the last one deals a lot with two different clans. Both movies also deal with religion and how it affected the Middle Ages. 




 I would say that these ten are the best ones:    

* Antichrist (2009)    
* Eraserhead (1977)       
* Hxan (1922)              
* Krkarlen (1921)   
* Les diaboliques (1955)           
* Les yeux sans visage (1960)      
* Onibaba (1964)      
* Repulsion (1965)    
* Rosemary's Baby (1968)    
* Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)     




 Edipo re (1967) by Pier Paolo Pasolini. The screenplay is adapted from the famous Greek tragedy by Sophocles. The movie starts for example in pre-war Italy, but the setting is later changed to the ancient world. Probably worth to know. But basically almost the entire movie is set in the ancient world. Good stuff. If you want a good biblical story, check out Il vangelo secondo Matteo (1964). That one is also directed by Pasolini and is a great and interesting retelling of the story of Jesus Christ. 









 Have you seen Stalker (1979)? One of the best science fiction movies ever. 




 The controversy surrounding Greed (1924) by Erich von Stroheim is very interesting. There's some stuff written down about it on [Wikipedia](http://tinyurl.com/yfy9vl6). 




 Nice stuff. That movie is truly a masterpiece. 









 My top three:    
1. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     
2. Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)    
3. Belle de jour (1967)      









 They'll probably show up soon. I just think we have to wait some more. Nothing else to it. 




 The ending of L'eclisse (1962) is fantastic. 




 Ten of my favourite horror movies that shouldn't be missed out:    

* Eraserhead (1977)   
* Hxan (1922)   
* La chute de la maison Usher (1928)    
* Les yeux sans visage (1960)    
* Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)    
* Onibaba (1964)     
* Possession (1981)   
* Repulsion (1965)     
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)   
* Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)     




 Are you referring to Meatballs (1979) by Ivan Reitman? If so, it already has been released on Blu-ray. [Here](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Meatballs-Blu-ray/427/) is the US version and [here](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Meatballs-Blu-ray/41364/) is the Canadian one. 




 I don't know if I would call that an essay really, but then again, that term could be quite vague. Most of it consisted of objective facts. I was expecting something more and critical. It didn't give me any new insights either. Anyways, it's always nice to see Tarkovsky getting some space here. It's a great film nonetheless. 




 He truly was! Yeah, I love that picture too. They were so cute. And I like what Kurosawa said about his movies:     

*"To not have seen the films of Ray is to have lived in the world without ever having seen the moon and the sun."* 




 I've seen several threads about it here. And it gets mentioned now and then in all kinds of places. It's even the most successful Irish film of all time if you look at the box office. The reception for it was mainly positive, there's somewhere over one hundred reviews for it at Rotten Tomatoes for example. So I wouldn't say that it's an unknown movie really. It also won some awards and got some nominations.     

But to contribute with a film to the thread, I'll say Tobenai chinmoku (1966) by Kazuo Kuroki. I posted about it in similar threads before, but I can't recommend it enough. To take an example, only 148 users have rated it on IMDb. It's rarely mentioned overall. It doesn't even have an official DVD release. I hope it gets a Blu-ray release one day, it really deserves it, or a double format release. One of the most underseen masterpieces of Japanese cinema of all time. Such a great film. 




 Scandinavia. 




 Well, the Blu-ray releases by Criterion are not the same region as the standard region in Scandinavia for example. So you have to get a region free player or one that plays that certain region to be able to watch them. Or do something else. It's a lot easier with DVD releases though, that's usually no problem to fix. 




 Because I use it as a standard on the Internet. English isn't my first language. And I don't like some English titles, so I always stick with the original ones, as those are the original titles and nothing else. Also, every movie has an original title, some movies don't have English titles at all, so I don't want to mix it either. 




 I don't like region codes at all either, it sucks. Especially for us in Europe when it comes to Criterion for example. And a good region free Blu-ray player seems to cost quite a lot too. 




 I don't know if you missed it, but there's already several Blu-ray releases of it. One [German](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Adventures-of-Buckaroo-Banzai-Across-the-8th-Dimension-Blu-ray/86439/), one [Spanish](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Adventures-of-Buckaroo-Banzai-Across-the-8th-Dimension-Blu-ray/124960/) and one [Australian](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Adventures-of-Buckaroo-Banzai-Across-the-8th-Dimension-Blu-ray/98243/). Arrow Films is also releasing it in July this year, [here's](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Adventures-of-Buckaroo-Banzai-Across-the-8th-Dimension-Blu-ray/128699/) a link to that one. 




 If you mean Gallipoli (1981) by Peter Weir, it actually got released on Blu-ray today. There is [this](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Gallipoli-Blu-ray/125128/)	edition and also [this](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Gallipoli-Blu-ray/125494/) one.      

Anyways, ten movies I have seen that should be released on Blu-ray:         

* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)   
* La maman et la putain (1973)   
* Mujo (1970)   
* Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986)   
* Quatre nuits d'un rveur (1971)    
* Shinj: Ten no Amijima (1969)    
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)   
* Suna no onna (1964)    
* Tsuit no zawameki (1988)    
* Un homme qui dort (1974)   

And ten I haven't seen that really need to be released on Blu-ray:       

* Al-mummia (1969)    
* Ashani Sanket (1973)   
* Der brennende Acker (1922)   
* Gu ling jie shao nian sha ren shi jian (1991)   
* Khesht va Ayeneh (1965)     
* L'amour fou (1969)     
* La nouba des femmes du mont Chenoua (1979)     
* Ragbar (1972)    
* Tobenai chinmoku (1966)    
* Qing mei zhu ma (1985)     









 Well, the big studio flicks are the ones that gets the general public excited and hyped, there's no doubt about that. I'm not a big fan of Marvel from the beginning, so I don't really get let down by their movies, because I know quite much what to expect from the beginning. I would say that the best movies usually (or more like always) are those that aren't a part of Hollywood, Disney and Marvel. 




 Can't say I'm excited for any of those really. At least there's other interesting stuff coming. 




 La peau douce (1964), Viskningar och rop (1972), Sanma no aji (1962) and Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) are some of my favourites when it comes to the latest releases. Sanma no aji (1962) was an upgrade though, I don't know you count that too. It's going to be interesting to see what's coming in the future, they'll probably announce new releases quite soon. 




 Film Comment and Sight   Sound (also published by BFI) are great and interesting sources, as someone already mentioned. IMDb is great for information mostly, like production details, cast, filmographies etc. There's really no other site that is as universal and complete as IMDb when it comes to that. Be sure to check out the external reviews by critics on IMDb though, you will found links to many different sites (including Sight   Sound) that together will give you a massive amount of all kinds of reviews. 




 Is it sad that people are different when it comes to taste? 




 Popil i diament (1958) by Andrzej Wajda. And yes, it's great! One of the best polish films ever made. It's a powerful depiction of war and how it can affect a person's choices. The cinematography is also beautiful and especially Zbigniew Cybulski is fantastic in his role. Probably the best movie dealing with Poland's war and post-war history. If you have the slightest interest in cinema, this movie shouldn't be missed. 




 Well, Murph also wanted him to go find Amelia, so he also had a reason to leave. I think Murph mostly was satisfied with Cooper keeping his promise, that he would return to her. I don't think one should put that end scene you mentioned as the main focus, how long he stayed there or how long he didn't. I didn't like the movie, but for me, it was entirely because of other reasons. 




 There's no set release date yet. I think they will announce new releases in a couple of hours or maybe in a day or two, they usually do it in the middle of the month, so we'll see if it's going to be announced. If not, I'm sure it will come in the near future. 




 It looks probably amazing. It seems that it will be released by Criterion on DVD/Blu-ray too, which sounds even more amazing. And I hope they will restore more of Ray's work soon. 




 It's not my favourite by Bresson either, but it sure is a great movie. I love how powerful it as and still so minimalistic and spare. I'm a big fan of Bresson's special film theory and his rules, so this is entirely a movie in my taste. Everything is stripped down to the barest essentials. Every composition is well-thought out, everything we see is supposed to be there and Bresson really knew what was important and what was not. The editing is totally uncompromising and unbending, everything is beautifully shot at the same time too. The movie overall is claustrophobic and gloomy. I also like how it's quite deprived of humor, drama and feelings, but still manages to be powerful and nuanced without villains and heroes. Bresson's movies were special, there's really nothing like them. I think this movie is a magnificent reconstruction. I have to rewatch it soon! Bresson surely was a master. 




 Interesting stuff. Polish cinema really has some gems to offer. He's picked out some great ones. It's just too bad that I live thousands of miles away from the cities that are having the event. 














 The Game (1997)? 




 I would also say that it's one of the best silent movies ever made! It's very special and well done. 




 Great! I hope you'll like it! 




 If you haven't seen Repulsion (1965) by Roman Polanski, it's of course essential. 




 Here's 15 documentaries I think would be very interesting to see in the collection:     

* Araya (1959)    
* As I Was Moving Ahead Occasionally I Saw Brief Glimpses of Beauty (2000)    
* Dead Birds (1963)    
* Dialogue with a Woman Departed (1981)    
* Diaries Notes and Sketches (1969)      
* Feng ai (2013)    
* Forest of Bliss (1986)   
* Fragments of Kubelka (2012)    
* Ladoni (1994)   
* Pour la suite du monde (1963)    
* Pripyat (1999)   
* Resan (1987)    
* Sayonara CP (1972)    
* Taiga (1992)     
* Tiexi qu (2002)    

Since I haven's seen them, I can't say why and so, but they just look very interesting and I surely want to watch them. It's also intriguing when Criterion releases stuff you haven't seen. Also, some of them don't have Blu-ray releases either, which would make it even more fitting. 




 Sure, I've seen 26 of his movies and from what I have seen, he surely is one of the great ones. These are my three absolute favourites:   

* Nattvardsgsterna (1962)     
* Smultronstllet (1957)    
* Tystnaden (1963)       

Some other essential ones in my opinion:    

* Ansiktet (1958)   
* En passion (1969)    
* Fanny och Alexander (1982)    
* Hstsonaten (1978)   
* Jungfrukllan (1960)    
* Persona (1966)       
* Skammen (1968)   
* Ssom i en spegel (1961)   
* Viskningar och rop (1972)  

I can also recommend his TV mini-series Scener ur ett ktenskap (1973). 




 I have only seen the first one, but I thought it was very silly, ridicilous, boring, ugly and mostly full of bad comedy. I guess I'm not a fan of the childishly Disney tone it has. 




 I know at least that I would have Werckmeister harmnik (2000) and No Quarto da Vanda (2000) on my list. 














 Stanley Kubrick. No doubt about it. 




 Yjinb (1961) is a good starter that's quite accessible. I don't know if you have seen Per un pugno di dollari (1964) by Sergio Leone already, but that movie is basically a remake of Yjinb (1961), so if you watched it, you will probably recognize the story. If you don't mind the length and have no problems with it, Shichinin no samurai (1954) isn't really a bad choice either. It also has pretty much every key element Kurosawa is known for, so you will get quite a good overview if you start with it. If you don't want to start with a samurai flick, I would go with Ikiru (1952), it's easy to like and has a quite sympathetic story that's easy to relate to. I know many that started with Rashmon (1950) and loved it, it isn't one of his longer films, so that is one option too. It's a bit more complex than Yjinb (1961) though. 




 They do! Two good movies! 




 The Room (2003). 



















 Isn't it quite obvious that the majority of people hanging out in this subreddit really likes superhero movies? Look at the news, the discussions and what gets upvoted, it's quite easy to tell if you've been here a while. By the way, I don't know if your second question was meant to be the same as the one in the topic or if you meant anything specific about the industry? 




 Isn't this a great opportunity for you to rewatch the movie then? And isn't it supposed to be you choosing what you yourself think are the best negotiation scenes? It seems like you aren't trying at all. 









 I don't know if I would say that he's that underrated, but maybe not recognized enough and that his movies are quite underseen would be a better description. As for the downvoting thing, it seems that users on this site tend to downvote quite much that they've never heard of or anything similar overall. I don't really like the voting system at all, but that's another discussion. Anyways, Terayama did some good stuff! 




 Well, as I already said, the site isn't anything for me and I won't use it in the future. I don't use any similar sites either. I was just curious about what the suggestions are based on and adding a bit of contructive critique.

There's already similar sites with different filters too:     
[http://agoodmovietowatch.com/](http://agoodmovietowatch.com/)      
[http://www.suggestmemovie.com/](http://www.suggestmemovie.com/)

[http://5000best.com/movies/](http://5000best.com/movies/)       

That's just some examples. So your friend should try to come up with something special that makes his site differ from the lot. If he wants to make his site unique. Maybe he doesn't. 





































































































































































































































 It would be interesting to know how many Korean films the person who did the list actually has seen. And maybe it would be easier to add "from 2001 and forward" or something similar, because there's only movies from 2001 and forward on the list. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989). 




 Three of my favourites when it comes to coming of age films:    

* Den-en ni shisu (1974)    
* Les quatre cents coups (1959)    
* Sho o suteyo machi e deyou (1971)     




 Not that bad. He's not always acting in the best movies though, but Dead Poets Society (1989) and Before Sunrise (1995) are worth seeing. If you started with Linklater's trilogy, you should probably see all three movies too, Hawke is good in all of them. The first one is the best for me. 




 What are the recommendations based on? 




 El espritu de la colmena (1973). 




 Great Imamura movie! Thumbs up. I remember I uploaded a still from it on this subreddit about a month ago. 




 Favourite underrated movie: The Limits of Control (2009)    
Favourite relatively unknown movie: Tobenai chinmoku (1966)      




 Play (2011) by Ruben stlund. 









 [Here](http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/cannes-first-poster-images-and-synopsis-for-apichatpong-weerasethakuls-cemetery-of-splendour-20150504) are some images from the film and some more information posted quite recently. 
























 Koroshi no rakuin (1967) and Yjinb (1961). 




 Yes. 




 Well, because I put it in the list of the films I haven't seen yet, I think that tells if I liked it or not. It doesn't have a proper DVD/Blu-ray release at all, I would love to see it restored in great condition and put out on Blu-ray. 









 Du rififi chez les hommes (1955). 




 I'm a big fan of Art Theatre Guild (ATG) from Japan. Some great movies they released:         

* Bara no sretsu (1969)     
* Kshikei (1968)     
* Mujo (1970)        
* Shinj: Ten no Amijima (1969)       
* Sho o suteyo machi e deyou (1971)       




 Onibaba (1964), Spalovac mrtvol (1969) and Possession (1981). 









 Watch Solyaris (1972) if you haven't done it. 




 Yes. 




 1. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) (Chantal Akerman)    
2. White Material (2009) (Claire Denis)      
3. Khaneh siah ast (1963) (Forugh Farrokhzad)    




 Bulle Ogier. 









 I love it! It's one of my favourites, also the best prison film in my opinion. The suspense is amazing. 









 I think I'll go with Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes (1972). But Fitzcarraldo (1982), Stroszek (1977) and Lektionen in Finsternis (1992) aren't far away from the top either. 




 The Tragedy of Othello: The Moor of Venice (1952). 




 Narayama bushik (1958) and The Holy Mountain (1973). 




 1. Se7en (1995) 3/5     
2. Zodiac (2007) 3/5   
3. Fight Club (1999) 2/5     
4. Panic Room (2002) 2/5    
5. The Social Network (2010) 2/5    
6. Alien 3 (1992) 2/5    
7. Gone Girl (2014) 2/5   
8. The Game (1997) 2/5    
9. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) 2/5     
10. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) 2/5      









 I have seen the Imamura movie, which was really good. But I know of the two others of course. 




 Vozvrashchenie (2003) fits in with pretty much when it comes about brothers arguing. And that part about a friend involved, there is a minor scene in it where it also happens. 




 I just watched Vozvrashchenie (2003). Not a bad one. I wish I had some Coca Cola now. 




 The ten I would recommend the most:     

* Andrey Rublyov (1966)    
* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)     
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)    
* L'eclisse (1962)    
* La notte (1961)    
* Nattvardsgsterna (1963)        
* Pickpocket (1959)    
* Smultronstllet (1957)     
* Suna no onna (1964)   
* Tanin no kao (1966)      




 Stntang (1994), a bit over seven hours long. A true masterpiece. There you have real comedy that's black as night. 




 I hope no one takes this seriously. For example, movies like Sinister 2 (2015) and Poltergeist (2015) didn't have their premiere yet, I don't even think the person who did the video actually saw them. And The Babadook (2014) was from last year. It didn't seem that there was much effort put to work here. It looks like something a 14 year old kid did who just found out about Internet and YouTube. 




 Me too! It's one of the best movies I have ever seen. Just rewatched it some days ago. Such a masterpiece. 




 Some examples:    

* Duelle (une quarantaine) (1976)   
* L'immortelle (1963)   
* La maman et la putain (1973)   
* Le rvlateur (1968)   
* Un homme qui dort (1974)      




  I love it and I hope Criterion releases it on BD.  

They did it almost two years ago. 




 Wasn't it obvious? Nolan and Zimmer are hitting on the big drum with a ton of exposition and bombastic music that clearly tells you where you're supposed feel excitement and when you are expected to be sad etc. It's almost like a parody. As I've said before, the big problem with Nolan is that he isn't able to tell with pictures. 









 I agree that this is a must see. If you haven't seen it, do it. Probably Fellini's best one. 




 Possession (1981). 




 I thought it was horrible. I can recommend Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) though, that's a good comedy film. 




 I think they should replace him with Michael Haneke. 




  Well this was actually Jonah Hill's idea.       

And that still doesn't rule out that he isn't a part of Hollywood. 














 Seems like Hollywood are out of ideas and looking for a cheap money grab. I can't see how it would turn out to be anything near good. The franchise milking nowadays is insane. 









 Pretty much all of my favourites are dramas, so my list would be like this:   

1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)   
2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)   
3. L'eclisse (1962)   
4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)    
5. Tanin no kao (1966)   
6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)    
7. Suna no onna (1964)   
8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)   
9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963)    
10. Stntang (1994)    









 Hana-bi (1997). 




 The last one was from November 11, 2014 to December 1, 2014. And it was 50% off. 




 Hard to make a top ten, but I think it would look like this for me:   

1. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)    
2. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)    
3. Stntang (1994)     
4. Zerkalo (1975)    
5. Solyaris (1972)   
6. Nema-ye Nazdik (1990)     
7. Belle de jour (1967)  
8. Tobenai chinmoku (1966)   
9. Saraba natsu no hikari (1968)    
10. L'anne dernire  Marienbad (1961)    




 Both are good, but I would go with Fassbinder! 




 It will be in English. Subtitled in Swedish. 




 I haven't seen all of them yet, but of the eleven films I have seen by him, Kshikei (1968) and Shinjuku dorob nikki (1969) were the ones I liked best. 




 Such a great and funny shima movie! 




 L'eclisse (1962). 




 Das Leben der Anderen (2006) is a good political drama/thriller. It seems to be available on DVD if you rent it through Netflix, I don't know about streaming though, I don't have the American version of the program. 




 Here's six of my favourite movies about World War II:   

* Die Ehe der Maria Braun (1979) (Rainer Werner Fassbinder)     
* Idi i smotri	(1985) (Elem Klimov)    
* Ivanovo detstvo	(1962) (Andrei Tarkovsky)    
* L'arme des ombres (1969) (Jean-Pierre Melville)   
* Lacombe Lucien (1974) (Louis Malle)    
* Voskhozhdenie (1977) (Larisa Shepitko)    

I don't know how many you've seen, but you maybe could have missed some of the ones I namedropped. All of them are great, I hope you'll find something that can be of your taste. 




 Hollywood wants more money. 




 Sounds like a bad idea. 




 C'era una volta il West (1968) has probably my favourite film score. The best part is the duel towards the end. 




 The only movie from 2010 and forward I might put in my top 100 when I do it next time would be Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013). 




 Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) and La maman et la putain (1973) are both fantastic. 














 Csillagosok, katonk (1967) and Idi i smotri (1985) are great. 




 Congratulations. It's a great movie. 




 I have to agree with the one who hated it. I also did. Overly dramatized, stupid, sentimental and melodramatic. Everything is so excessive to the point that it just makes it silly to the max, from the jokes to the drama and messages. For me, it's a wonder that people like this so much. 




 Woody Allen. 









 In a Lonely Place (1950). 









 Here's my top 10 films under 100 minutes:        

1. Nattvardsgsterna (1962) (81 minutes)       
2. Hiroshima mon amour (1959) (90 minutes)    
3. Smultronstllet (1957) (91 minutes)      
4. Pickpocket (1959) (75 minutes)     
5. Spalovac mrtvol (1969) (95 minutes)      
6. Tystnaden (1963) (96 minutes)      
7. Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956) (99 minutes)     
8. Nema-ye Nazdik (1990) (98 minutes)      
9. Une femme est une femme (1961) (85 minutes)      
10. Gion bayashi (1953) (85 minutes)      














 The Limits of Control (2009). 




 He needs to learn how to tell with pictures. 




 Hard to choose only one, but I've always held City Girl (1930) by F.W. Murnau very high, so that will be my answer. 




 [Here's](http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/173-8-1-2-a-film-with-itself-as-its-subject) a little essay by Alexander Sesonske that maybe could help you a bit on the way. 




 Sanma no aji (1962) with sake. 




 Woody Allen. 




  1. Do you recommend me watching it in one sitting or multiple?      

I would recommend to start watching it early in the day, that way you have some hours to spare. The whole movie is split in parts, so that makes pauses quite easy. So if you need a pause, it's easy to find some time for it, the movie allows it. I think it's best to pause where you feel like, whether you for example have only one break or maybe two or three. One pause in the middle is probably the most essential.      


 2. Does the length ruin the film in the sense that it becomes boring or self-indulgent? (I've always wanted to see it, but I'm slightly teased by the idea that I might be wasting seven hours of a day watching a film which I won't like, plus the fact that the DVD boxset of the film is a tad pricey)       


I would rather say that the length does the opposite. Sure, it's maybe not a movie you put on every other day, but if you allow to immense yourself into Tarr's world, you're in for a treat, especially if you liked his other movies. Stntang (1994) gave the a certain resolved feeling of time after while, I think Tarr was very good at doing it. It felt hypnotizing and sometimes you didn't really know how many of the hours actually passed. If you liked the Tarr movies you've seen so far, there's no reason why you shouldn't watch it!       

 3. How does it compare to other Bela Tarr films in terms of quality and themes? Is it better than most Tarr films, the best? Is it similar or different in some ways?      


Werckmeister harmnik (2000) has for example a bit more surrealism, considering the whale and such. The narrative structure isn't as in his other works either. Everything is divided into twelve parts and it jumps six moves forward, then six back. Also, the doesn't always move chronologically. But maybe you already know that. If not, it's good to know and to be prepared. I'm almost done reading the novel the movie is based on, it also has the same structure. The mood in Stntang (1994) is quite similar to Werckmeister harmnik (2000) and A torini l (2011), but the themes are not maybe exactly the same. You'll recognize some things from his other films though, you'll get quite much nihilism, just like in A torini l (2011), And it's very existential.       
Stntang (1994) is visually very much like Werckmeister harmnik (2000), A torini l (2011), A londoni frfi (2007) and Krhozat (1988). You'll get the black and white photography and of course the long takes. You'll probably recognize the environments as well, there's many crumbled buildings and hopelessness almost everywhere. When Tarr did Krhozat (1989), it was at this point where he started with his later metaphysical style, so you probably know that all of his movies before that one were very different and more social realistic with a raw, documentary feel over them. About his best film, I really think I hold Stntang (1994) as his biggest masterpiece. It's just amazing. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989). 




 There's no news about it for the moment. It hasn't even premiered anywhere yet, so it's a bit early to tell. You should keep an eye out on IMDb though, it will likely be posted there when it's official. 




 Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972). The movie has an all-female cast and is set entirely in the home of the main character. So good. 




 Well, you always have IMDb, even if it's obvious. There's also external reviews there. You also have [AsianWiki](http://asianwiki.com/) and [Midnight Eye](http://www.midnighteye.com/) too, the later one has a focus only on Japanese movies too. But my best recommendation would be A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors: From the Silent Era to the Present Day by Alexander Jacoby, a great book.
 




 * La libertad (2001)      
* Liverpool (2008)    
* O Pagador de Promessas (1962)      




 Les quatre cents coups (1959), Sho o suteyo machi e deyou (1971) and Den-en ni shisu (1974) are some of the best ones. 




 I used the original title, but it's also called that, yes. 









 Du rififi chez les hommes (1955) and Le cercle rouge (1970). 




 A shame to ruin such a good tribute with such a terribly mediocre and dull composer as Zimmer. 




 It seems good enough for the general public as it is now. Just look at the kind of money the movies are making and their big fanbase/praise. A majority of the critics love the big Marvel movies too. 




 So? 




 I think my list would look like this:     

1. Banshun (1949)     
2. Genroku Chshingura (1941)   
3. Double Indemnity (1944)    
4. Vredens dag (1943)   
5. Les enfants du paradis (1945)   
6. The Third Man (1949)   
7. Meshes of the Afternoon (1943)  
8. Ladri di biciclette (1948)   
9. Chichi ariki (1942)     
10. The Maltese Falcon (1941)   




 You are thinking about Crash (1996) by David Cronenberg. 









 L'eclisse (1962), I always end up thinking about it almost all the time. 




 Didn't the actual reviews tell you why? 




 Le samoura (1967). 




 It's very loosely based on both the novel Piknik na obochine by the Strugatsky brothers and the movie by Tarkovsky. 




 Andrei Tarkovsky. 




 For example, pretty much any feature film by Andrei Tarkovsky. Andrey Rublyov (1966) or Stalker (1979) are great examples. 




 I'll give you my favourites:     


* Banshun (1949)     
* Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956)       
* Smultronstllet (1957)     
* Jalsaghar (1958)     
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959)    
* Pickpocket (1959)   
* Le trou (1960)    
* La notte (1961)     
* L'eclisse (1962)    
* Nattvardsgsterna (1962)       
* Sanma no aji (1962)         
* Tystnaden (1963)      
* Suna no onna (1964)     
* Andrey Rublyov (1966)     
* Tanin no kao (1966)      
* C'era una volta il West (1968)    
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)      
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)      
* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)      
* Solyaris (1972)     
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)  
* Zerkalo (1975)      
* Stalker (1979)       
* Krhozat (1988)        
* Der siebente Kontinent (1989)    
* Stntang (1994)      




 Probably the best scene in the movie, I love it when Isabelle Adjani is freaking out. Good stuff. 









 A lot of silent movies don't have any music tracks or sound at all. To answer your question, a big percentage of avant-garde/experimental films includes no actors/voice actors, just to take an easy example. I understand if it's effective for most of the movies you see, I was just curious what you do when a movie doesn't at all have any of the components you rate. 




 Maybe you should try Winter's Bone (2010) and Mud (2012), they are a bit similar to Blue Ruin (2013). 




 Smultronstllet (1957) is a great start. One of my favourites by him. Easily the best Swedish director ever. And one of the best overall too. 




 If they are available, I always use subtitles when watching a movie in a language I don't understand. But then again, I even used subtitles for movies in languages I already know. It seems to me that you haven't seen that many foreign films and aren't that used to subtitles? I don't see the whole thing as a problem, rather something necessary instead. I think it simply will improve with time, it's something you have to get used to. 
























 I thought it was a bit bland, uninspiring and mediocre. The slapstick and whole tone of the movie is just missing charm, it's just nothing special. I've seen much, much better from Woody Allen. 




 * Superhero movies from Hollywood        
* The amount of remakes, sequels and reboots from Hollywood       
* Ugly orange and teal color filters     




 If I had to pick out 20 of the greatest ones, I would pick these:       

* Bronenosets Potemkin (1925)     
* City Girl (1930)     
* Coeur fidle (1923)     
* Der letzte Mann (1924)      
* Flesh and the Devil (1926)          
* Frau im Mond (1929)        
* Hxan (1922)      
* Krkarlen (1921)    
* L'argent (1928)        
* La chute de la maison Usher (1928)     
* La passion de Jeanne d'Arc (1928)            
* Mnilmontant (1926)       
* Metropolis (1927)     
* Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927)        
* Tagebuch einer Verlorenen (1929)       
* The Crowd (1928)        
* The Last Command (1928)      
* Tretya meshchanskaya (1927)        
* Umirayushchii lebed (1917)     
* Un chien andalou (1929)      









 Bananas (1971). 




 Pretty much every movie. At least 95 percent, maybe even more. 




  It's not easy to put these into genres.       

That doesn't mean that one should just put movies where they don't really belong.       


 I put this under Samurai because it needed to go on the list and I meant period drama. However, I have heard people using the term "Samurai Cinema" as a synonym to period drama.        

Period dramas are called jidaigeki. Samurai movies or "sword fighting" movies are called chanbara, which is a subgenre of jidaigeki. 




 The last one under "Yakuza", the film by Imamura isn't a film about yakuza, it's about a serial killer that wasn't at all affiliated with the yakuza. And putting Batoru rowaiaru (2000) under "Yakuza" films too? That doesn't make sense. Also, neither Narayama bushik (1958) or Narayama bushik (1983) (depending on which film you mean) have anything to do with samurais. Just these things makes me wonder if the person who did the list actually watched the films. 




 Imagine Lorre trying to whistle, but just failing, poor guy! Then sweet Lang comes to the rescue. How isn't that cute? 




 That's quite cute. 




 Nattvardsgsterna (1962) (Sweden). 









 Favourite science fiction movie:        


* Tanin no kao (1966)       



Favourite horror movie:         


* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)       




 The original, no doubt about it. The remake is horrible and just made everything worse. 




 Yes. Le rvlateur (1968) for example, great movie. 




 I'm glad to hear that! That's some amazing movies!    

 But you must be crazy if you think that a person who had such an acute negative reaction to Scorpio Rising would enjoy these two - similarly subversive, daring and at times campish - films. No way in hell.              



Oh, I didn't think that at all. I took those two (or three) as examples of some of my favourites just to put it in context with what is unknown and not for that specific user, because I was wondering about that part. But anyways, the user was just asking about what I considered as absolutely great of the ones that are more unknown, so it wasn't specifically something that had to be according to the user's taste, just mine. I think our tastes already differ a bit from the beginning, I for example really like Dead Man (1995). When it comes to Scorpio Rising (1964), it's quite different than the movies I took as examples though, I wouldn't call the ones I mentioned campy either. 




 Well, thanks! Or something, heh. I think I started going through the list a couple of years ago, maybe 4, not more than 5 at least. I did not stricly go by it though, I watched a lot of other stuff in between.       


 I'd love to talk to you more about the whole thing.       


Feel free to ask anything if you have more questions, I'd be happy answer them as good as I can.    


Hidden gems, you say? Well, it depends what you mean with great but otherwise quite unknown. The ones I like the most in the list aren't really that unknown. But it's hard to just put some titles out if I don't know what you consider unknown. A certain amount of ratings on IMDb? Checks on ICheckMovies? Or anything else? For example, Jalsaghar (1958) by Satyajit Ray and Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) by Chantal Akerman aren't really unknown if you are cinephile, but a general user that hangs out on r/movies may have never heard about them. Those two are some of my favourite movies on the list, same with Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. But as I said, I wouldn't consider them unknown, so it's hard to pinpoint out any specific movies if I don't exactly known what your criteria would be. 




 Les rendez-vous d'Anna (1978). A great, minimalistic, determined and uncompromising movie about a detached and disconnected female director. Amazing character portrait, interesting and insightful conversations and a hypnotic pace. 




 I felt that it was qutie bad in the start, but got better as it went on. The plot felt thin overall, the same thing with the characters. I appretiate what Gosling is trying to do here, but many things felt forced and that he was trying to be poetic, shocking and cool, but failed. Almost like he wanted to do a mix of Lynch, Argento, Korine and Refn, but with mostly style over substance. It didn't have anything really special making it quite good. On the other hand, it's better than a lot of stuff coming nowadays from Hollywood at least. 




 I have only 5 films left on that list, so I'm guess I'm still going. I have waited with some of those I have left for different reasons. But the so called "ride" was fun and interesting so far. And of course, some movies weren't at all great, but many were. I see it as a list of movies that are good to know about when you are talking about cinema in general. The list also changes through the years. It's also many different films, so you probably get a lot out of your comfort zone, which is good if you are studying films a bit more than usual. One good thing is that you get a lot of reference to work with, which is useful in many ways. I think it's good to mix your watchlist too, to not feel obliged just to go after this particular list. Remember to watch what you want to watch. On another note, TSPDT has a list that's a bit more interesting and diverse if you want to dive into similar missions. Although, both focus pretty much on American cinema and Europe, so much stuff is left out, same with experimental films for example.        
      

I'm a person who likes lists, so these things are often enjoyable for me, but I of course always have other movies to watch at the same time. As someone else said, think of it as a guide, it's great for beginners, because you get a glimpse of the history of cinema in a way, and you'll probably learn about and discover different directors etc. You don't have to like every single movie, it's great to be critical and know what you like and not like. Be prepared to be seeing movies that you maybe won't like, don't forget that. What I'm saying is that it's a great list to start with as a guide if you are just getting interested in movies.

 That movie is so good. That's how you do a coming of age film! I love the crazy color filters. And as you said, the soundtrack is top notch! 




 Andrei Tarkovsky. 




 I watch movies because it is interesting. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989), the best one. 




 Not a great one, but The House of the Devil (2009) has it. 




 Le trou (1960) is great and suspenseful. 




 Some of them are really innovative, brave, special and have much interesting political content. Just take Nema-ye Nazdik (1990) by Abbas Kiarostami for example. It's about a man pretending to be the famous Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf, he convinces a family that he's making a movie and promises them a part in it. The interesting part is that the actual people involved in the incident re-enact the actual events. It also features footage from the real trial that took place. The mix between fiction and documentary is great, just like the erasing of borders with what is real and what is staged. The meta aspects give it great depth too. Kiarostami is one of the most interesting directors working today.          

Other Iranian films that are good and important to check out as well:      


* Ayneh (1997)    
* Jodaeiye Nader az Simin (2011)     
* Nun va Goldoon (1996)       
* Ta'm e guilass (1997)     




 It depends what you mean with old too. But Hiroshima mon amour (1959) and Suna no onna (1964) are great and not corny or outdated at all. 




 And again, who could have posted this Teshigahara movie other than you? It's welcomed as always, you usually put up interesting and good films here. This isn't really one of his best ones, but it isn't at all that bad. It would look even better with a Blu-ray treatment! I have the book it's based on which I should start reading soon too. 




 The Tatar invasions in Andrey Rublyoy (1966). Brutal and well done, there's so much happening at the same time. Total chaos and war. Especially the way Tarkovsky cut and used tracking shots in this sequence is amazing. 




 Not really. The whole character felt forced, too obvious and over the top. Almost like a movie for children. But then again, even if I cared for him, the film had way bigger problems. And I should add that for me, it really doesn't matter if I can sympathize with the characters, it doesn't directly make a movie better or worse, which some other people think. Some examples of the pathetic dialogue:    

* *"Chappie if you want to be in the gang you have to be cool, like daddy! Look how daddy walks! Look how cool it's! Need to keep it gangsta' Chappie!"*      

* *"It's time to pump up the jam!"*      

Or just about anything coming from Die Antwoord. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989). 









  Will 2015 go down as one of the great years in movies?    

I really doubt that. Why would it? The year isn't even over yet. I don't think we'll see the amount of masterpieces this year that will make 2015 something special worth remembering as a mark in the history of cinema. I feel that a huge miracle would have to happen if 2015 could offer something that could even be near to compete with some great years in the past. I would say that the great years are long gone and that it's been like that for a long time. Of course, some good movies come out now and then, but to put this year so high up already? That seems like a stretch.     



 Already we've got one of the best Action, sci-fi, and Horror movies in decades.           


Well, that's your opinion. But I think you should think about it and give it a couple of years, then go back and see if you still feel the same. It seems that the general public on Reddit always have a thing to hype every year this way. All of this really makes me wonder how many movies people have seen. 




 Kenj zankoku monogatari (1964) by Takumi Furukawa. 




 I thought it was horrible. For a narrative film of this kind, the story was too simple sided and in the end, you don't really care about anything at all. The whole movie felt something like a promotional commercial for Die Antwoord, which was silly. And quite everything actually felt silly, stupid, hollow and over the top in a bad way. From the pathetic dialogue to the action and to how it was shot. It's hard to take it seriously, because it doesn't work as a comedy or any kind of critique of something either. It makes me wonder if Blomkamp offered someone from junior high to write him the dialogue. 









 1. Rocco e i suoi fratelli (1960)       
2. The Hustler (1961)      
3. Raging Bull (1980)    
4. The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962)    
5. Fat City (1972)        









 Woody Allen. 




 Le samoura (1967) of course. 









 If you want good movies about geishas, I would suggest to skip Memoirs of a Geisha (2005) that some people already told you about. Instead, I recommend these:   

* Gion bayashi (1953)   
* Gion no shimai (1936)   
* Kimi to wakarete (1933)    
* Saikaku ichidai onna (1952)    
* Uwasa no onna (1954)    

Especially Mizoguchi's movies about geishas were great, they have a very feminist touch, and it's also interesting because his sister was a geisha too. Great director, particularly Gion bayashi (1953) and Saikaku ichidai onna (1952) are some of his best ones. 









 I didn't like it at all. It felt quite superficial with silly and nonsensical action scenes that were supposed to be "cool", but rather felt tiresome and perfunctory. I really disliked the visual style too. And original? I would say the opposite. The movie didn't do anything original, nuanced, experimental or interesting at all with the time travel concept. Many things just seemed rehashed from before. There's other movies that actually have something intriguing to say about time travel, this was mostly just a cheap Hollywood take on it with a big slab of shallow action to disguise everything and please the general Tom Cruise fan. But this is just what I thought and I'm probably stepping on some toes, especially here on Reddit where people seem to praise this film and have very low standards overall. 




 I haven't seen the movie, but I don't know why you would be alone when it comes to this, especially why you would ask it too. But to answer your question, you are not alone, I know that for sure. 




 I really love Der siebente Kontinent (1989), a real punch in the gut. 




 You should watch L'anne dernire  Marienbad (1961), Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) and Zerkalo (1975). 




 Stntang (1994). 




 None. 




 * La notte (1961)      
* La peau douce (1964)  
* Le mpris (1963)             
* Nostalghia (1983)     
* Providence (1977)   
* Satansbraten (1976)    




 * A Zed   Two Noughts (1985)    
* Il sorpasso (1962)      
* Stntang (1994)     




 Hiroshima mon amour (1959), Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975), Suna no onna (1964) and many more. 



















 Stalker (1979). 









  Has anyone been able to watch all of tinker-tailor-soldier-spy without falling asleep OR using ritalin?        


Yes. 




 They already did. And they already are. A movie came out last year and a new TV series about them is coming this fall. 




 Nope. At least not yet. On the other hand, I doubt that there would be any movie scene that could change that. 














 Stalker (1979)! 




 Because many people have low standards. 




 Daniel Day-Lewis seems to be high up, especially if you look at his latest roles. 









 * Tanin no kao (1966)      
* Solyaris (1972)      
* Stalker (1979)      
* 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)      
* Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986)      
* Welt am Draht (1973)       
* La jete (1962)      
* Metropolis (1927)      
* Posetitel muzeya (1989)      
* Frau im Mond (1929)      



















 The Limits of Control (2009). 




 Read, get to know your film history, talk with people, hang out on different forums and sites, check out different film lists etc. 




 Yeah, I have that for some. 




 I don't know if it maybe has to do with rights. But I agree about Iran. And it would be lovely to see more from Taiwan. Also, African countries overall would be great to see more from too. In fact, it would be interesting to have almost anything older in the arthouse vein from countries like Turkey, Egypt, Romania, Greece, the Philippines, Brazil etc. 




 1. Andrey Rublyov (1966)    
2. L'eclisse (1962)    
3. Tanin no kao (1966)       
4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     
5. Suna no onna (1964)       




 It wouldn't kill you to load the whole album, because the names and more info show up then. 









 La jete (1962). 




  The White Ribbon (2009)  144 Minutes      
Mulholland Drive (2001)  147 Minutes       
Blue Velvet (1986)  120 Minutes      
Lost Highway (1997)  134 Minutes        
2001: A Space Oddysey (1968)  160 Minutes       
Dead Man (1995)  121 Minutes         

Do not miss out on those! 




 On the contrary! Mr Bongo released it on DVD a while back, it's available from their website and also on Amazon. There's also one Japanese and one Polish Blu-ray release out. 




 Rekopis znaleziony w Saragossie (1965) is great when it comes to the older ones. It has a really cool frame story and it's a hell of an adventure. 




 There's not really an overload of Polish titles in the collection. But be sure to get Nz w wodzie (1962) by Roman Polanski. You also have Trois couleurs: Blanc (1994) and La double vie de Vronique (1991) by Krzysztof Kieslowski that are partly Polish. 




 * A Woman Under the Influence (1974)     
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)  
* Mamma Roma (1962)      
* Mat i syn (1997)       
* Rakuyju (1986)     




 Andrey Rublyov (1966). 




 Huh? 




 Smultronstllet (1957), Andrey Rublyov (1966) and C'era una volta il West (1968) are highly rewatchable. 




 Kakushi-toride no san-akunin (1958) and Divorzio all'italian (1961) that you are namedropping are for example available on Hulu. Netflix seems to be overall quite bad if you are looking after movies outside Hollywood or the mainstream and even older movies. To take an example, the Swedish version is a joke if you are looking for movies before 1960. There's other streaming services though, like Hulu, Fandor and Mubi that are much better if you are in search for older flicks. Also, buying physical copies is a great way to do it too. 




 It seems that Kynodontas (2009) could be up your alley. Maybe even Stalker (1979), which is a masterpiece. 




 10 good movies at least. Nice to see Ozu in the top! He truly was a master. 




 Some are from the DVD/Blu-ray releases, others are screen captured by me and some are from various sites on the Internet. 




 Better late than never. I actually rewatched Clo de 5  7 (1962) some days ago. Charming little film. 




 A selection:     

* Hiroshima mon amour (1959)      
* L'eclisse (1962)      
* Nattvardsgsterna (1963)       
* Suna no onna (1964)           
* Andrey Rublyov (1966)     
* Tanin no kao (1966)      
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)     
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)    
* Der siebente Kontinent (1989)      
* Stntang (1994)      




 Just by seeing the title, I knew it was you who uploaded the album! A good Imamura film, always nice to see your uploads. 









 I also almost forgot about Nema-ye Nazdik (1990), it really deserves to be mentioned in this case. It's quite special, because it's a mix of both fiction film and documentary. It's about a man pretending to be the Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf who takes advantage of a family while promising them to be involved in his next film. It's actually based on real events and the roles of the real people who were involved in the story are played by themselves. Great movie! 




 I thought This Is the End (2013) was quite bad, but you have Le mpris (1963) where Fritz Lang plays himself and Sunset Blvd. (1950) where Cecil B. DeMille, Hedda Hopper, Buster Keaton and some other actors are playing themselves, that's at least two good movies. 









 Sure, I can recommend checking out these:     

* Matka Joanna od aniolw (1961) (Jerzy Kawalerowicz)    
* Sanatorium pod klepsydra (1973) (Wojciech Has)     
* Struktura krysztalu (1969) (Krzysztof Zanussi)        




 No, none. I hope they will do it in the future. Other companies have released some of their stuff though, I know that there's at least two movies from Has that's been released in Poland on Blu-ray, but several other movies from those three directors deserve the Blu-ray treatment too, especially a bit more universal versions. 




 And that's almost nothing compared to Polish directors like Wojciech Has, Jerzy Kawalerowicz and Krzysztof Zanussi, they get shimmied to the side even more! 




 It's absolutely no requirement to enjoying and/or understanding the movie, but it's of course easier to understand everything if you know more, it says itself. 




 To make it short, it's one of the best and most important Polish films ever made, particularly about Poland's war and post-war history, just that makes it worth watching. If you have any interest in cinema at all, it's a mandatory watch. The movie is a powerful depiction of war and how it can affect a person's choices. The cinematography is also beautiful and especially Zbigniew Cybulski is great in his role. [Here](http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/826-ashes-and-diamonds)	and [here](http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/363-ashes-and-diamonds)	are two interesting smaller essays about it at Criterion's website which gives some more insight. 









 I haven given 26 movies the score 5/5. 




 Many people seem to use that as an argument. Sadly. 














 Hopefully one or all of these:      

* Himiko (1974)     
* Les rendez-vous d'Anna (1978)      
* Midareru (1964)  
* Nayak (1966)        
* Nobi (1959)     




 Smultronstllet (1957). 




 Woody Allen. 




 I'm voting for Woody Allen. 




 He's a superhero. Why even question things like these in a Marvel movie? It just seems pointless. 




 I haven't seen Furious Seven (2015), Iron Man 3 (2013), Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014), Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006), and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011), but I can't say that I really care about the rest or that they're good movies. The taste of the general public is usually quite bad, these things pretty much confirm it for me. A movie that's making a lot of money isn't automatically good. 




 Tonari no Totoro (1988). 




 Have you read reviews for the movie? It seems that they would give you the answer. 




 Michael Haneke. 




 Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) and La maman et la putain (1973) are two of the best ones. 




 Showgirls (1995). 




 It's not one of the best films from the wave, but asolutely worth watching. I gave it 3/5. I think it's one of the earliest examples from the Czechoslovak New Wave too. 





























 Thumbs up for this. One of the best directors in the history of cinema. It's sad that he died so early. All hail Fassbinder! 




 Ten of my favourite screenplays:        

* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)      
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)      
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959)       
* L'eclisse (1962)      
* La notte (1961)    
* Pickpocket (1959)       
* Sanma no aji (1962)      
* Smultronstllet (1957)      
* Suna no onna (1964)       
* Tanin no kao (1966)        




 Spalovac mrtvol (1969). 




 Manhattan (1979). 














 I haven't seen Fury (2014), so my list isn't necessarily a list of movies that are similar to it, but they are ten of my favourites when it comes to war movies:   

* Apocalypse Now (1979)      
* Csillagosok, katonk (1967)    
* Idi i smotri (1985)     
* Ivanovo detstvo (1962)        
* L'arme des ombres (1969)      
* Lacombe Lucien (1974)     
* Nobi (1959)      
* Popil i diament (1958)      
* Paths of Glory (1957)      
* Voskhozhdenie (1977)       




 [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwb3P0fuM1c) scene from C'era una volta il West (1968), the final duel. Pure magic. If you haven't seen the movie at all, I would advice you to not watch the clip if you are sensitive when it comes to spoilers. 



















 I really like the ending to L'eclisse (1962). The whole movie is of course a masterpiece, but since we're talking about endings, I have to mention it. It would almost be a bit pointless to post a clip, because you really have to see the whole film until the very end to be able to put the ending in context. Also, the final shots are just breathtaking and amazingly framed. It's one of those endings that really stuck with me, it's very special. 




 I haven't seen it yet, but it sounds absurd to me that it would be better than Stalker (1979). 









 I don't know if you are kidding or not, but I hope we don't get anymore of them. 














 1962 was an amazing year. We got L'eclisse (1962), Sanma no aji (1962), Procs de Jeanne d'Arc (1962), La jete (1962), Le doulos (1962), Tsubaki Sanjr (1962), Mamma Roma (1962), Il sorpasso (1962), El ngel exterminador (1962), Lolita (1962), Seppuku (1962), Ivanovo detstvo (1962), Vivre sa vie: Film en douze tableaux (1962) etc.        


1964 and 1969, thats two other years that were great too. Just overall, I find it hard to see how anything could beat the sixties. It was in the sixties that some of the best and most interesting waves came and/or had their peak, for example the Japanese new wave and the French new wave. It was also at that time some of the best, most interesting, most creative, and most influental directors ever were working, we had Robert Bresson, Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky, Hiroshi Teshigahara, Jean-Luc Godard, Michelangelo Antonioni, Ingmar Bergman, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Jean-Pierre Melville, Akira Kurosawa, Yoshishige Yoshida, Louis Malle, Kaneto Shind, Alain Resnais, Shhei Imamura, Masahiro Shinoda, and many, many others. Just take Japanese cinema as an example, that period was crazy and filled with good cinema. Aside from film, it happened quite much in the sixties from a political view all over the world, so I guess that had to do a lot with what movies we got too. 









 The framing is amazing! You really sit and get amazed by every single shot. I love the angles and the compositions. The lightning is great too, everything is just so goddamn precise. 




 If it has to be people that are alive, I would want to see a movie with Lszl Krasznahorkai as a writer and Michael Haneke as a director. 




 Gamlet (1964) by Grigori Kozintsev. 




 * Al-mummia (1969)       
* Gu ling jie shao nian sha ren shi jian (1991)        
* Khesht va Ayeneh (1965)        




 A lot. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975), L'eclises (1962), Zerkalo (1975), Sanma no aji (1962), and many, many more. The thing is, I no longer really care that much about trailers in general. If something sounds interesting for specific reasons, I usually end up watching it without looking at a trailer, especially when it comes to older movies, there's a lot of them that don't even seem to have trailers uploaded on the Internet etc. And often I don't feel the actual need to look at a trailer, it's enough knowing what a movie is about and who the director is for me. 




 Some examples would include Masahiro Yamada, Andrei Tarkovsky, Satyajit Ray, Tonino Guerra, and Robert Bresson. 




 Welt am Draht (1973) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder is great. I would rank it quite high when it comes to science fiction movies in general, it's actually that great. 




 Nattvardsgsterna (1962), Smultronstllet (1957) and Tystnaden (1963). 




 I haven't seen Tropic Thunder (2008), but if I made a top 1000 list, I wouldn't have the other two on it. So to answer your question, I've seen much, much better. 




 I believe the user meant The Divide (2011) by Xavier Gens. The TV-series is about a district attorney, not any kind of apocalypse. 




 Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986) by Konstantin Lopushanskiy. It has been described as one of the most depressing films ever made. The thing is, it doesn't need to have graphic depictions of rape, murder, cannibalism etc. I think that's mostly an easy target to the audience, and Hollywood likes to use similar dramatic situations to show us how bad things are, and they often tell us that in a very superficial, manipulating and dramatic way, to cause certain easy effects. But Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986) doesn't use cheap ways to show the apocalypse, that's what I like about it. It has a pitch-black atmosphere that can't be found in movies like The Road (2009). It doesn't have any melodramatic piano music or something similar like in The Road (2009). It's just dark, depressing and actually has something interesting to say. 




 I like it, but I wouldn't rank it that high when it comes to his movies. I feel that it doesn't have anything against Manhattan (1979) for example. 




 To go after what the majority of people here think is unknown isn't a good parameter at all. It especially shows when movies like Moon (2009) and In Bruges (2008) are on the list. So to answer your question, none of those movies are really "largely unknown". And if someone wants to get a laugh, check out the Reddit thread that is linked in the article. 




 I'm just about to start this evening rewatching La notte (1961). 




 Jeanne Moreau has worked with Michelangelo Antonioni, Luis Buuel, Louis Malle, Theo Angelopoulos, Jacques Becker, Orson Welles, Marguerite Duras, Tsai Ming-liang, Franois Truffaut, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Wim Wenders. Not easy to beat. 









 Is he? He's for example not ranked on the list of directors at TSPDT and I've probably never seen him mentioned as a director on any other more serious list. He doesn't seem to be that widely mentioned and that highly regarded in film literature in general either. I wouldn't rank him so high after seeing his three animated feature films, he's mostly a mediocre Hollywood director in my eyes. And I doubt that Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011) and Tomorrowland: A World Beyond (2015) would change my view of him. I think he's mostly highly regarded by every Tom, Dick and Harry, the general IMDb users, people on Reddit, the mainstream critics over at RT and judges who give out the more commercial awards, just to take some examples. 














 I prefer the original. The remake is horrible in comparison. Everything is better in the original. Everything from the soundtrack to the cinematography and especially how the story is told. 




 * Mulholland Dr. (2001)  
* Persona (1966)                
* Werckmeister harmnik (2000)             














 It's not been released on any form of home media, so no streaming or DVD/Blu-ray available yet. The movie has mostly been screened at various festivals so far. If you want to watch it as soon as possible, you will have to do it in a movie theater. Look at IMDb for release dates in various countries. 




 Nightcrawler (2014). 




 Jean-Pierre Laud in Les quatre cents coups (1959). 




 C'era una volta il west (1968) by Sergio Leone, no doubt about it. It's just perfect. 




 Damn! My fault!      
The other two aren't as amazing as Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969), but still great and absolutely worth watching. 




 Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, it's the best. Takes place in the protagonist's house and the cast is all female. A masterpiece.

 No, I don't. 




 Great! One of the best horror movies of all time. Amazing atmosphere and a good soundtrack too.

 La plante sauvage (1973).

 Le beau Serge (1958). 




 I actually did a blind buy of the Blu-ray myself. It's a great and beautiful movie with lovely performances. I really recommend it. It sticks with you. 














 Here's ten movies that could be something for you:      

* A Zed   Two Noughts (1985)      
* Andrey Rublyov (1966)    
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)        
* Gion bayashi (1953)    
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959)   
* Jalsaghar (1958)      
* L'eclisse (1962)     
* Pickpocket (1959)     
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)     
* Tanin no kao (1966)    

Since you know about Godard, Fellini and Bergman already, we can skip those aside a bit when it comes to recommendations. These ten movies will introduce you to some interesting and important directors, also some of my absolute favourites. All of them are visually interesting and philosophical, but mainly some of the best movies ever made, from Czechoslovakia, Italy, Japan, Soviet Union, India, United Kingdom and France, which is quite a little mix I fixed for you. If you like some stuff by Godard, Fellini and Bergman, there's a big chance that these movies will be in your taste too. 














 There's quite much I still haven't seen yet, but I'll take the three best movies that I gave 3/5 (the highest score so far) to from last year:      

1. Xi you (2014)     
2. Turist (2014)    
3. Mr. Turner (2014)      

For the record, I've only seen 37 films from 2014 too. 




 I really don't get surprised anymore, there's always going to be people who haven't seen popular and well known movies like The Godfather (1972), Star Wars (1977), Titanic (1997), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Pulp Fiction (1994), Forrest Gump (1994) etc. I only get surprised if it's someone I already know when it comes to certain movies or any similar matter. When I just started watching more and more movies, there were many classics that I missed, so I don't get that surprised if people who aren't into movies that much haven't seen certain films. 




 Well, many are good and Hollywood are seeing potential in them, of course they want to use them if they are popular and can make some money. There's many kind of roles for these kind of actors. But as someone already said, "foreign" actors have always been around in American cinema. The movie industry is getting bigger and bigger, so it's easier to spot everything and everyone now. 




 * Solyaris (1972) (Eduard Artemyev): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uM7722EAz0      
* Stalker (1979) (Eduard Artemyev): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP1QXKbhqr4      
* Tanin no kao (1966) (Tru Takemitsu): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_mcyKFOEpg                
   




 I can't say I liked it that much. The director isn't doing anything interesting with the nonlinear storyline, the use of music tried to be quirky and indie (The Smiths etc.), but felt mostly forced, cheap and so obvious. When using this kind of music in a movie, it doesn't have to be subtle, but it's no juxtaposition of interest or anything done with finesse. There's not really any good drama and the comedy parts are totally missing charm. The voiceover is quite bad, silly and doesn't do or add anything either, it's just in the way overexplaining things. I also disliked how it was shot with its distastefully "in your face" form. On the other hand, it's a bit better than the majority of similar modern romantic comedies from Hollywood, but that doesn't make it good. I've seen far suckier movies of course, but this one is easy to forget and nothing I would rank high at all. 




 It really depends on what you are looking after. The books are quite different from each other and cover different periods, genres and topics. But one favourite is Eros Plus Massacre: An Introduction to the Japanese New Wave Cinema, I'm a big fan of the Japanese New Wave and some of the directors that emerged from it, so I'm happy that there's a whole book covering it. As a more general book, I like A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors because of its big, diverse and wide coverage of directors.     

I'd also love to find a book on Setsuko Hara, she's wonderful! I don't think there's any book about her in English yet, am I right? 




 Here are some useful and interesting books that can be of your interest:    

* A Hundred Years of Japanese Film        
* TokyoScope: The Japanese Cult Film Companion      
* The Japanese Film: Art and Industry (Expanded Edition)      
* Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema      
* The Yakuza Movie Book: A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films      
* The Japanese Filmography       
* A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors         
* A New History of Japanese Cinema: A Century of Narrative Film    
* Reframing Japanese Cinema: Authorship, Genre, History       
* Eros Plus Massacre: An Introduction to the Japanese New Wave Cinema     
* Outlaw Masters of Japanese Film     
* Recalling the Treasures of Japanese Cinema       
* Classical Japanese Cinema Revisited       
* Nippon Modern: Japanese Cinema of the 1920s and 1930s   
* Cinema of Actuality: Japanese Avant-Garde Filmmaking in the Season of Image Politics      
* No Borders, No Limits: Nikkatsu Action Cinema         

Some of them are more specific (like the one about the Japanese New Wave) and some of them are more general (A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors for example, which I really recommend), I think you'll notice. I actually just received copies of No Borders, No Limits: Nikkatsu Action Cinema and The Midnight Eye Guide to New Japanese Film some days ago, the later one covers mostly newer movies, but it has some pages that cover directors like Seijun Suzuki, Shhei Imamura and others that were active before 1970. Also, there's a lot of books covering certain directors, but I'm guessing that you already know that and that you're more interesting in something of a more general coverage. But this list will be a good guide for starters. 
























 Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) by Yoshishige Yoshida. A very rich, interesting, beautiful and complex portrayal of history, sex and politics. Truly a masterpiece. 









 As someone already kind of mentioned, Ozu was the master when it came to movies about everyday life with great dialogue. Check out the movie already mentioned, these are also worth checking out too:      

* Akibiyori (1960)       
* Banshun (1949)     
* Tky boshoku (1957)       

The movies by Jean-Pierre   Luc Dardenne could be something for you too, they work with quite much realism, some examples:       

* Le fils (2002)    
* Le gamin au vlo (2011)     
* Rosetta (1999)       

Also, most stuff by Eric Rohmer would fit the bill. They are very heavy on dialogue which is often very good written, check out these:      

* Conte d'automne (1998)      
* L'amour l'aprs-midi (1972)      
* Ma nuit chez Maud (1969)      

And at last, three other movies by different directors I can recommend too:      

* Aruitemo aruitemo (2008)     
* I fidanzati (1963)         
* Struktura krysztalu (1969)      




 Pretty much anything from Tarkovsky and Tarr. Movies like Andrey Rublyov (1966), Stalker (1979), Solyaris (1972), Stntang (1994), Krhozat (1988), and Werckmeister harmnik (2000) are full of amazing and long takes. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykpJkf76X04) is a great example from Werckmeister harmnik (2000). 




 Another gem from Yoshida, great stuff. 









 Hollywood is actually a disgusting business full of sexism and racism, this is a good example. It's just sad that not many people are aware of it. 




 *"The first trailer shown in a U.S. film theater was in November 1913, when Nils Granlund, the advertising manager for the Marcus Loew theater chain, produced a short promotional film for the musical The Pleasure Seekers, opening at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway. Loew adopted the practice, which was reported in a wire service story carried by the Lincoln, Nebraska Daily Star, describing it as "an entirely new and unique stunt", and that "moving pictures of the rehearsals and other incidents connected with the production will be sent out in advance of the show, to be presented to the Loews picture houses and will take the place of much of the bill board advertising". Granlund was also first to introduce trailer material for an upcoming motion picture, using a slide technique to promote an upcoming film featuring Charlie Chaplin at Loew's Seventh Avenue Theatre in Harlem in 1914."*         

/[Wikipedia](http://tinyurl.com/6rjbmdu)	 




 * Annie Hall (1977)      
* Bringing up Baby (1938)       
* His Girl Friday (1940)        
* Holiday (1938)         
* Manhattan (1979)

 I just throw them in the trashcan. 




 The final duel scene from C'era una volta il West (1968):    
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwb3P0fuM1c 




 You don't have to watch the first one to get the second one. On another note, I wouldn't recommend the movie at all. It's just dumb, disgusting and silly trash in the worst ways possible. There's tons of other movies that are ten times better to watch. 




 L'eclisse (1962), I stumbled upon it years ago on a film site. It was amazing and today it's one of my absolute favourites. It also pretty much helped to start my interest in cinema. 




 Possession (1981). 




 I think it was La passion de Jeanne d'Arc (1928), a great one. 




 You should watch Tanin no kao (1966), it's the best. 




 Masahiko Shimazu, Benkei Shiganoya, John Cazale, Hohi Aoki, Jean Keraudy, El Hedi ben Salem, and Karuna Bannerjee. 




 Of course. Collecting is fun, I also like physical copies. And some have interesting extra features. 









 Tanin no kao (1966). 




 There's some interesting coverage on these sites right now:

 I know I've seen many people that believed True Romance (1993) was directed by Quentin Tarantino, but he was the one who wrote the script and Tony Scott directed it. 




 The Godfather (1972), Taxi Driver (1976) and A Clockwork Orange (1971) seem to have that rating if you want movies from the top 100 over at IMDb. If you haven't seen them, I would say that all three of them should be seen if you have the slightest interest in cinema. Maybe a little obvious, but it's hard for me to figure out what you've seen when you're talking about the ratings. Considering what other movies you like, I think they could be something in your taste. 









 I was quite curious how the movie probably butchered everything that had to do with BDSM. And I wasn't really surprised that it would be bad, I expected it. But I think it's very helpful, useful and interesting to watch many different kind of movies., which I try to do as much as I can. 




 Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) probably tops my list of the ones I've seen. 




 The goodbye between Piero (Alain Delon) and Vittoria (Monica Vitti) in L'eclisse (1962). 




 It's not allowed to advertise, promote, post or comment about illegal filesharing of movies or any other media here. 




 It's not available to stream legally yet. 




 Tanin no kao (1966), with no doubt the best one. Also, Les yeux sans visage (1960) is another one I hold quite high up on my top list. 




 La jete (1962) by Chris Marker, the movie Twelve Monkeys (1995) was inspired by. It's great, darker and much better than Twelve Monkeys (1995), Donnie Darko (2001) or any similar stuff. When it comes to time travel, don't miss out on Je t'aime je t'aime (1968) by Alain Resnais either. 




 Woody Allen. 














 This one is great! It has a fast pace and is cool as hell.      

 Ah, but have you seen Norifumi Suzuki? That's some completely bonkers cuckoo-bugfuckery right there.    

You mean movies by the director? I've seen some scenes from Fury anego den: Inoshika Och (1973), Christina Lindberg is in that one, heh. Other than that, I haven't really explored that Suzuki further. 









 There's tons of great stuff. I really don't know what you have seen, but I'll give you three great recommendations:     

* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)    
* Stalker (1979)    
* Suna no onna (1964)     




 You should try Belle de jour (1967), a great one by Luis Buuel. 




 * Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)       
* Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (1979)       
* Only Lovers Left Alive (2013)     
* Vampyr (1932)       
























 * 30s: M (1931)       
* 40s: Banshun (1949)       
* 50s: Hiroshima mon amour (1959)       
* 60s: Andrey Rublyov (1966)      
* 70s: Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)      
* 80s: Der siebente Kontinent	 (1989)         
* 90s: Stntang (1994)     
* 00s: The Limits of Control (2009)    
* 10s: Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)       




 You got some general and some specific recommendations already, here's some that I would add:     

* 8 (1963)      
* Accattone (1961)       
* I fidanzati (1963)     
* I pugni in tasca (1965)       
* Il deserto rosso (1964)      
* Il posto (1961)       
* Il vangelo secondo Matteo (1964)       
* L'eclisse (1962)      
* La notte (1961)       
* L'avventura (1960)     
* Mamma Roma (1962)   
* Viaggio in Italia (1954)       

Antonioni's alienation trilogy is truly amazing, I would say that especially L'eclisse (1962) is one of the best films ever made. 




 Someone else already mentioned Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) by Yoshishige Yoshida, that's what I would say too. It's just sad how ignored Yoshida really is when it comes to cinema in general, many of his films are really amazing. I would love to see this one on Blu-ray. 




 Bringing up Baby (1938) and The Big Sleep (1946). 




 It's just pure aesthetic perfection, especially the framing is amazing. One of the best movies of all time too. It's also a tragedy that not a single Yoshida movie is out on Blu-ray, especially this one. 




 Examples of some gorgeous films:       

* 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)       
* Andrey Rublyov (1966)        
* C'era una volta il West (1968)    
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)     
* L'eclisse (1962)        
* Mujo (1970)      
* Stntang (1994)        
* Stalker (1979)         
* Tobenai chinmoku (1966)     
* Zerkalo (1975)       

The bell scene in Andrey Rublyov (1966), the final duel in C'era una volta il West (1968), the hair washing scene in Zerkalo (1975) etc. There's so much stuff that's amazing. 




 You can use http://www.imdb.com/search/title to search for films with specific titles. 




 I think it's you. But to each his own. 









 I would suggest starting with Ivanovo detsvo (1962) and going on from there. It's a bit more accessible than his later works and a perfect start. Great movie too. 




 Thanks a lot for this! Now I'm waiting for The Freshman (1925), Riot in Cell Block 11 (1954) and The Complete Jacques Tati to pop up in the mail. The shipping gets quite high, especially if it's going to be delivered to Europe, but as you said, it's still a good deal. And by the way, I don't know if any of you got it too, but The Complete Jacques Tati on Blu-ray just went for CDN$ 10.39 also. 




 Great to see Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) on the first place, that's what I would put there too. I was just waiting for it to show up when scrolling down! Some other great choices that are top favourites from 1975 for me as well. Thumbs up for choosing films by Angelopoulos and Fassbinder too. 









  I'm not sure it would count though - when the film begins, he's already tied in a mobius strip isn't he? You can hear the sirens blaring past with the "dick laurent is dead" on the intercom (I know, I'm being picky here).      

It was a long time ago when I saw it, but I checked a bit, and it starts with Fred Madison receiving that message on the intercom, but he isn't tied or anything, he's in his house. So yeah, it all depends on how you want to count it. The events sure are mysterious though. 




 You are welcome, it's a great movie! Have you seen Lost Highway (1997) by David Lynch too? If not, that would also fit the bill. Werckmeister harmnik (2000) by Bla Tarr is another recommendation. 




 How about Blue Velvet (1986)? 




 It's about eight interwoven stories, which occur in the lead-up to the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, it's just set on the other side of the Atlantic, that's where Denmark gets in the picture. 









 Stntang (1994). If you mean by year. 




 That's Hollywood in a nutshell. Money, money, money. What were you expecting? 




 Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) by Chantal Akerman. 




 It sounds a bit like Wandfuru raifu (1998), could that be it? 




 The Act of Killing (2012). Make sure to watch the longer version. 




 * Delphine Seyrig in Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)         
* Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence (1974)      
* Margit Carstensen in Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) 




 I waited some time with Stntang (1994) (~7 hours), Shoah (1985) (~9 hours) and Out 1, noli me tangere (1971) (~12 hours), but I finally saw them. Well worth the time, all three movies. For me it's mostly been about being in the right mood, not having the time was never really a problem. 




 Krhozat (1988). 




 It could be a progressive and very interesting thing if it's done in a great way, but I don't think we can expect somethng like that from a company like Marvel. Just look at their gender roles and how women are portrayed for example. 




 When I first heard about Jurassic World (2015), my expectations were very low. When I saw the trailer, nothing really changed, it just confirmed my feelings. I try to not have too high expectations overall when it comes to movies, but they are mostly at their lowest when we're talking about these kind of big mainstream films from Hollywood. At this point, you typically know what to expect from them. I don't associate modern day mainstream Hollywood with cinematic masterpieces exactly. 




 The Wicker Man (1973) is a must watch, not a bad one at all. 




 I have to say Stntang (1994). I really enjoyed the movie pretty much more than the book. 









 Interesting reading. And interesting to hear about the parts that Satyajit Ray helped with. I have to get my hands on this one. 




 Doesn't get better than these:      

* La jete (1962)      
* Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986)      
* Stalker (1979)           




 I posted this list in a similar thread in another subreddit. Here's 20 of my favourite movies that are 90 minutes or under that I would consider the best:          

* Csillagosok, katonk (1967) (90 minutes)         
* Gion bayashi (1953) (85 minutes)              
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959) (90 minutes)                
* I fidanzati (1963) (77 minutes)             
* Koridorius (1995) (85 minutes)            
* La jete (1962) (28 minutes)            
* Le rvlateur (1968) (67 minutes)                          
* Les yeux sans visage (1960) (88 minutes)                   
* Mouchette (1967) (78 minutes)              
* Nattvardsgsterna (1963) (81 minutes)         
* Nun va Goldoon (1996) (78 minutes)            
* Obrazy starho sveta (1972) (70 minutes)                             
* Okasareta hakui (1967) (56 minutes)            
* Persona (1966) (85 minutes)            
* Pickpocket (1959) (75 minutes)            
* Procs de Jeanne d'Arc (1962) (65 minutes)             
* Sayat Nova (1969) (79 minutes)             
* Shinjuku maddo (1970) (65 minutes)            
* Un homme qui dort (1974) (77 minutes)       
* Une femme est une femme (1965) (85 minutes)          




 L'eclisse (1962). No other movie does it better. 




 La jete (1962) is easily the best. 




 Rainer Werner Fassbinder in Faustrecht der Freiheit (1975) where he plays the main role. What a guy. 




 I wasn't surprised the first time I read about it either. A good one! Haneke has great taste. 














 Double Indemnity (1944). 




 Yeah, me too. But I'm glad that he at least is going to make another movie. 









 Du rififi chez les hommes (1955). 




 Kuroi ame (1989). 




 It's great. Well shot, great actors and a surreal and dark plot. One of David Lynch's best films. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989). 




 Here's ten great movies that I feel most people really have missed:      

* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)       
* Himiko (1974)  
* Le rvlateur (1968)            
* Mujo (1970)       
* Obrazy starho sveta (1972)   
* Onna no naka ni iru tanin (1966)   
* Shura (1971)          
* Tabiate bijan (1974)        
* Tobenai chinmoku (1966)       
* Tsuit no zawameki (1988)       

All of them are really good and deserve more attention. It's for example a bit sad that a great director like Yoshishige Yoshida is so unknown. It's even more heartbreaking that some of the movies I mentioned still haven't got any proper releases, I hope that will change in the future. 




 Too hard for me to make a top ten, but I know at least I would put these on my list:            

* 8 (1963)      
* Kokuhakuteki joyron (1971)        
* Le mpris (1963)      
* Nema-ye Nazdik (1990)    
* Nun va Goldoon (1996)              
* To vlemma tou Odyssea (1995)       




 A few of my favourite silents aren't on the list either, like Umirayushchii lebed (1917), Krkarlen (1921), Hxan (1922), Die Nibelungen: Siegfried (1924), Coeur fidle (1923), The Merry Widow (1925), Tretya meshchanskaya (1927), L'argent (1928), Frau im Mond (1929), City Girl (1930), Zemlya (1930), and  propos de Nice (1930). I saw other movies by Victor Sjstrm, Yevgeni Bauer, Erich von Stroheim and Jean Epstein on the list though. 




 I've seen 69 of them, a lot of shorts that I haven't taken the time to watch. Some interesting choices overall. Some of my favourite silents are present, so that was nice to see. This makes me eager to make a list of my own and also watch some of those that I haven't seen yet. 




 1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)     
2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)     
3. L'eclisse (1962) 




 Il sorpasso (1962) and Saraba natsu no hikari (1968). 




 Krhozat (1988) by Bla Tarr. Also, do not miss out on Juhy no yoromeki (1968) by Yoshishige Yoshida that someone else already mentioned. 














 8 (1963). 




 Aruitemo aruitemo (2008). 




 Nattvardsgsterna (1963). 




 Sanma no aji (1962). 




 Andrei Tarkovsky. 




 No, how much money a movie makes has nothing to do with how good it is. 




 It always depends on what you mean with minimalism. But in general terms, nobody did minimalism like Robert Bresson, especially his later films. For example, look at Pickpocket (1959). But first, read about his rules and the way he made his films, it's very interesting and a must if you aren't familiar with his style. He stripped away every bare essential as much as he could, from the acting to the sound. I believe he was the true minimalist. 




 Tobenai chinmoku (1966) by Kazuo Kuroki. 




 Double Indemnity (1944) is really his best one in my opinion. One of the best movies when it comes to film noir and even American cinema in general. He's done some other good movies too (and some weaker ones), but I wouldn't call him that obscure as you seem to. Maybe he's not that discussed on a place like this, especially if you compare him to names like Kubrick, Hitchcock and Scorsese, but I feel that there's also some other great filmmakers that get mentioned even less (or possibly not at all). I guess it always depends on what and how you are comparing everything. 




 This month. 




 Post Tenebras Lux (2012)? 




 Tonari no Totoro (1988). It's cute, quick-witted, heartwarming, charming, has a magical atmosphere and looks stunning. It doesn't really rely heavily on conflicts either, which I think makes it even better. 




 Suna no onna (1964) and Spalovac mrtvol (1969). 




 I think it could be interesting. There's several other Mexican movies than the ones he was in I rather see getting the Criterion treatment, but on the other hand, I'd welcome some Cantinflas movies more than some other stuff. Also, more Mexican cinema in the collection would probably be a good choice. 




 Repulsion (1965). 




 La plante sauvage (1973) is probably the best one I've seen. 




 I don't have any specific parameters that I look for. But for a biopic to be really great, it has to be special. And in what way, that's something I wouldn't really know until I've seen it. For me, the form and how a biopic is done, that's for example far more important than if it covers a certain period of a subject's life or an entire existence.

My three favourite biopics that I feel are far superior than others:       

* Andrey Rublyov (1966)   
* Edvard Munch (1974)   
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)   

What makes these three superior is their form and content and how they relate to each other. Tarkovsky's way of working and sculpting in time together with his philosophical and metaphysical depth, the interesting documentary approach Watkins uses, to Yoshida's interwoven and absurdly complex narrative which binds together time and subjects. 




 Director:        

* Michael Haneke      


Actors:       

* Isabelle Huppert       
* Isaach De Bankol       
* Kati Outinen      
* Taraneh Alidoosti         




 The Shining (1980) by Stanley Kubrick. 




 Woody Allen. 




 You should check out some classic film noir set in Los Angeles:       

* Double Indemnity (1944)       
* Kiss Me Deadly (1955)        
* The Big Heat (1953)      
* The Big Sleep (1945)     

L.A. Noire took quite many influences from these kind of movies, as you probably know, several titles can be found when looking for the golden film reels. I would also recommend Chinatown (1974) if you want something newer. It is set in 1937, but maybe that's good enough too. That movie is very similar to L.A. Noire. 




 Andrey Rublyov (1966). 




 Sanbiki no samurai (1964) by Hideo Gosha and Genroku Chshingura (1941) by Kenji Mizoguchi. 




 It's really enjoyable and entertaining. One of the best silent movies. If you will be bored? That's a strange question to ask, how should other people know that? On the other hand, it's a must watch if you have the slightest interest in cinema. The movie is a milestone when it comes to science fiction films, especially when it comes to the ones depicting a dystopia. Just the amazing sets makes it worth to see. It's as relevant today as it was back then, maybe even more now. 




 The Straight Story (1999). 




 Book chon bang hyang (2011). Hong Sang-soo's movies are really good. 




 Exactly! 




 Run times are quite secondary. One of the best films I have seen was over 7 hours long, another one was only 75 minutes, so it's quite irrelevant for me. The run time of a movie has nothing to do with the quality of it, there's so many other factors to the whole picture. Everything depends on how the movie is done, not how long the run time is. Shorter movies can sometimes even feel longer than the longer ones etc. Run times have never been a problem for me though. 




 I would put Amour (2012) and Ni na bian ji dian (2011) as the top ones in my list. By the way, the 2000s and the 21st century isn't the same thing, just a heads up. 









 My favourite is Sanma no aji (1962). 




 Chish Ry. 




 Conte d'automne (1998). The majority of Rohmer's films have great, realistic, smart and enjoyable dialogue. 




 Some kind of supernatural entity. Also, the director Mitchell said the following:             


*"I'm not personally that interested in where 'it' comes from. To me, it's dream logic in the sense that they're in a nightmare, and when you're in a nightmare there's no solving the nightmare. Even if you try to solve it."* 














 Three good movies about filmmakers:     
 
* 8 (1963)    
* Stardust Memories (1980)       
* To vlemma tou Odyssea (1995)       


Three good movies about painters:     

* Andrey Rublyov (1966)       
* Edvard Munch (1974)      
* La belle noiseuse (1991)      




 Gamlet (1964). 




 It does! 




 Trois couleurs: Bleu (1993) by Krzysztof Kieslowski. About a woman (played by Juliette Binoche) struggling to find a way to live her life after the death of her husband and daughter. 



















 Michael Haneke. 




 Le trou (1960). 




 That's the way life can be. 














 It's a bit hard to rank, but I would at least put these five in the top:       

* A torini l (2011)       
* Amour (2012)       
* Book chon bang hyang (2011)      
* Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)       
* The Act of Killing (2012)       

Is it for a specific reason that your list only contains movies in the English language? Do you have another list for the rest? Or why did you put emphasis on that part? I don't get it.          




 No. He doesn't even come close to masters like Mizoguchi, Bresson, Tarkovsky, Bergman etc. 




 No. The best movie I've seen is of course my favourite, Der siebente Kontinent (1989). 




 To take an example, 2004 isn't old. And I'm pretty sure the majority with the least interest in movies who hangs out here has seen or knows most of those in the list. Many of them are the most celebrated ones here on Reddit. 




 Not at all. 




 No, but by directors that actually can make something good. 














 Woody Allen. 









 What do you mean with playing it safe? I don't think the majority of critics are writing what the public wants to hear, I think most of them are honest. But then again, I'm no expert in how the majority of critics do their work. By the way, I rather feel that movie critics overall nowadays are even too generous, but that's me.        

Anyways, let's talk about the movie. I thought it was quite bad. I wrote something about it in a similar thread, so what I'm going to say is about the same I said before, but it's always interesting to talk about movies and share your own opinions. For a narrative film of this kind and for it to be an allegory of interest, the story was too simple sided and superficial. In the end, I couldn't care less about anything. The whole movie felt something like a promotional commercial for Die Antwoord, which was silly. And quite everything actually felt silly, stupid, hollow and over the top in a bad way. From the pathetic dialogue to the action and to how it was shot. It's hard to take it seriously, because it doesn't work as a comedy or any kind of critique of something either. It makes me wonder if Blomkamp offered someone from junior high to write him the dialogue.      




 Manhattan (1979). 




 Here's 20 of my favourites that are 90 minutes or under:     

* Csillagosok, katonk (1967) (90 minutes)       
* Gion bayashi (1953) (85 minutes)      
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959) (90 minutes)      
* I fidanzati (1963) (77 minutes)        
* Koridorius (1995) (85 minutes)              
* La jete (1962) (28 minutes)        
* Le rvlateur (1968) (67 minutes)       
* Les yeux sans visage (1960) (88 minutes)      
* Mouchette (1967) (78 minutes)         
* Nattvardsgsterna (1963) (81 minutes)     
* Nun va Goldoon (1996) (78 minutes)      
* Obrazy starho sveta (1972) (70 minutes)          
* Okasareta hakui (1967) (56 minutes)       
* Persona (1966) (85 minutes)       
* Pickpocket (1959) (75 minutes)        
* Procs de Jeanne d'Arc (1962) (65 minutes)      
* Sayat Nova (1969) (79 minutes)         
* Shinjuku maddo (1970) (65 minutes)          
* Un homme qui dort (1974) (77 minutes)       
* Une femme est une femme (1965) (85 minutes)       




 If Studio Ghibli are going to continue, maybe they could do a good job with it. Or if they could team up with Apichatpong Weerasethakul as a director in some way. 




 I think I like Sang sattawat (2006) and Sud sanaeha (2002) the best, especially when they're at their most minimalistic state. He's indeed one of the most interesting directors working today. Really looking forward to his newest movie. 




 Jean-Pierre Laud did an amazing job in Les quatre cents coups (1959). 





























 Oh. This looks really, really bad. The silly slow motion scene with the bullet, the totally tiresome sound effects in these kind of new trailers, the music, and of course the superficial action scenes they probably had to cut in to compensate the total lack of anything of value I guess this movie has. 




 No, I don't have any reason to limit myself that way. Even if I'm not a big fan of a specific actor, I would never refuse to watch a movie because that specific actor is in it, I think it's better to be more open-minded and not refuse to watch movies because of certain actors. There's of course some movies I would rather watch than some others, but I don't have any need to have a definitive list of actors that I absolute refuse to watch. 




 Kes (1969) by Ken Loach. The cast for the film had authentic Yorkshire accents, which isn't maybe the easiest to understand.    

A little bit of trivia:              

*"In a 2013 interview, director Ken Loach said that, upon its release, United Artists organised a screening of the film for some American executive and they said that they could understand Hungarian better than the dialect in the film."* 




 While I like Tonari no Totoro (1988) more, have you seen Gake no ue no Ponyo (2008)? It's also directed by Miyazaki and could be up your alley too. 




 A good one! One of the better war movies, especially when it comes to portraying the real horrors of war. It's very dark, dirty, haunting and has a great atmosphere. 




 I can think of Le manoir du diable (1896) by Georges Mlis. There's supernatural things happening, but not really any death. 




 Ten of the best/my favourite ones:    

* Eraserhead (1977)     
* Hxan (1922)                      
* Les diaboliques (1955)            
* Les yeux sans visage (1960)                
* Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)                     
* Onibaba (1964)              
* Possession (1981)          
* Repulsion (1965)              
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)                 
* Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)             




 There's certainly not many good ones, but I would go with Antichrist (2009) by Lars von Trier. 




 I have the 2-disc set from Artificial Eye that also comes with Krhozat (1988), but I don't remember where the screen came from exactly, I think I've had it on a computer for a while.  









 I would just take it as your favourite director that has at least one movie in the collection. Andrei Tarkovsky for me. 




 One example is L'eclisse (1962). The end is known for being a bit puzzling for many people, but if you haven't seen everything before the end, it will probably be even more puzzling, especially because the main characters the movie is about aren't present at all near the end. You really must have seen the whole movie to be able to put the end of it in some context at all. 




 Liverpool (2008). 




 I don't just like a long film because it's long, time is irrelevant for me. Why I like Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)? Well, first of all, I'm a big fan of the uncompromising outlook Akerman had with the whole movie. It has pretty much everything I love. Static shots, no soundtrack, toned down performances, long takes, depth, important things to say, a very unsentimental story and just a lot of everydayness. The compositions are clever and smart. The color palette is also very stripped down, which works great with the whole form. It almost the epitome of "show, not tell", since it's not that much dialogue either. I really like minimalism, and Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) does it perfectly, but still has great depth in both its character portrayal of Jeanne and the images overall. It's probably one of the biggest and most interesting portraits of a woman in the history of cinema. The portrait of Jeanne is both down to earth and realistic. We really get to know her and suffer with her. It's an important movie both as art and social commentary, mostly because of Akerman's depiction of the role women have in society, what we expect from them and the alienation to society and life. It's a feminist masterpiece if you ask me.       

I like when directors manage to catch the hugeness in the little things in life, which I think is something important in cinema. Akerman even had a theory that you have to look at things long enough to really see them, which is a thrilling point. Just like Tarkovsky, the movie has a sort of disruptive feeling of time. When something has that and keeps me thrilled at the same time, I simply have to embrace and love it.      




 I've watched all those, I also mentioned that No Country for Old Men (2007) looks quite okay. I'm more of a fan of cinematographers like Motokichi Hasegawa, Sven Nykvist (mostly his work with Bergman), Vadim Yusov, Gbor Medvigy, Gianni Di Venanzo etc. When it comes to the newer ones, I prefer Liao Pen-jung, some of Christopher Doyle's work, and Fred Kelemen for example. When it comes to movies like Skyfall (2012) or A Beautiful Mind (2001), I feel that they have that typical Hollywood look that a lot of newer movies have. The specific color gradings, the use of lightning, sometimes too much brightness  for my taste and sometimes not that kind of contrast that has a lot of depth which I like. I'm just not too much into the way those movies look. Sometimes it can do much with the directors certain cinematographers work with, so maybe it has a lot do to with that. If Deakins worked with Lav Diaz or Tsai Ming-liang, then the result would possibly be more something for me, I don't know. As I said, he's not bad at his profession, I simply don't want to put him that high up on my own list. 




 Film Art: An Introduction by David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson is a good book to start with. 









 First of all, I haven't seen the movie, so I'm not going to say anything about it's quality, but it still makes me a bit worried and hesitant about it, especially if you know what kind of movies tend to get high ratings. You shouldn't take the IMDb Top 250 that seriously. There's a lot of shadow accounts there, trolls, corrupted votes, people that only use 1 or 10 when they vote etc. And also, any Tom, Dick and Harry can make an account on the site and start voting. I'm not saying that every single user is doing this, but there's absolutely no reason to take the list and the ratings seriously. A big part of the people on IMDb belong to the general public, and I have always felt that the general public isn't the definitive consensus to trust when it comes to cinema, especially not when it comes to a website with that kind of rating system. It's anyways always much more interesting to know what people think about movies if it's those that I know have watched a lot of them, have a lot of knowledge, have studying movies on a more critical and serious level and have a big bubble of references, than just some total strangers I don't know anything about. The IMDb Top 250 is a list by the general Internet public (and possibly some corruption), it's nothing you should look at with a too serious eye. Of course, it's much about taste too. But I think one should have in mind what you are dealing with. For example, people tend to upvote some of the big and newer Hollywood movies like crazy. 




 Of course, just what I said. I can't say I like how movies like The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Skyfall (2012) and A Beautiful Mind (2001) look for example, but Deakins did a better job with No Country for Old Men (2007) to name one. He's good at what he does, I'm just not a huge fan of the majority of his work and how it looks, but that's just my taste. So yeah, there's of course a ton of movies that look much, much worse too. 




 I'm a bit tired of the whole thing with sequels, prequels and remakes in Hollywood today. So I'm not that anticipated for it. Incendies (2010) by Denis Villeneuve wasn't a bad movie, but I can't say I liked Enemy (2013) or the mediocre Prisoners (2013) that much. On the other hand, he is a much better choice as a director than a lot of the other ones working in Hollywood today. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of Roger Deakins either, but there's a lot of worse cinematographers out there too. I'm absolutely going to see the movie though. Blade Runner (1982) is a classic, but not one of my favourites, it will still be interesting to see what will be done with this one nonetheless. 




 I believe the person meant that the movie will be based on the novel by Philip K. Dick. 




  and there was one I watched on Amazon prime about a woman who became a photographer in the late 1800 early 1900s but the title is eluding meat the moment.       

You probably mean Maria Larssons eviga gonblick (2008) by Jan Troell. 




 I don't believe it was chosen at random. As I said, the symbol has been imprinted in the culture of Japan for a long time now. You can see it in a lot of places today. Especially in Japan, from lanterns to Buddhist temples. Even the Ku Klux Klan used it. I didn't say it was a direct reference to the clan, but it's worth to read about it and know that it's been used for a long time in different parts of the world. I haven't seen the movie, but since I know it's about the history of Japan and war, it makes more sense that it wouldn't just be a reference to the game series. 




 Here's my top ten films that are non-English:              

1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)    
2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)     
3. L'eclisse (1962)     
4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)      
5. Tanin no kao (1966)      
6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)      
7. Suna no onna (1964)      
8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)        
9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963)      
10. Stntang (1994)    

But yeah, a lot of the foreign films were and still are way ahead of Hollywood in so many ways, especially in this day and age. Most of my favourite movies are not English language ones, it just happened to be that way for now. There's so much good foreign stuff. And of course, a lot of bad. But what's good is quite superior if we compare it to Hollywood. It's the same with directors for me, some of my favourites for the moment are Andrei Tarkovsky, Robert Bresson, Ingmar Bergman, Michael Haneke, Kenji Mizoguchi, and Yasujir Ozu. Right now I'm quite into Japanese cinema, particularly from the 1950s to 1970s. It's almost like a constant project going through foreign/world cinema and discovering and watching films from all over the world, it's interesting and fascinating. And when it comes to overshadowing, it really shows how much foreign cinema is overshadowed if we compare it to Hollywood in a subreddit like this. Not a surprise though, just a thoughtful remark. 




 I don't believe it's a reference to the games, it's a very old symbol that has been around in Japanese culture for a long time. And because this is a movie that's about Japanese history, it makes pretty much sense that it wouldn't just be a reference to the game series.

 It's best to ignore it. It's hard to take the majority of people on those boards seriously. There seems to be a lot of trolls too. 




 Thanks! I totally missed that this is coming before you mentioned it. Pre-ordered it today! I can't wait now! 




 And he's holding some Ozu. 




 1. Paris, Texas (1984)      
2. Naked (1993)     
3. A Woman Under the Influence (1974)      
4. Down by Law (1986)    
5. Do the Right Thing (1989)         




 * Hiroshima mon amour (1959)      
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     
* Zerkalo (1975)      




 ICheckMovies has some great and interesting lists. Otherwise it's through books and various film sites etc. 




 Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975). 




 Potential for anything good? Not really. Not if it's going to be in the exact same vein as the previous movies. I feel that it would just be another mainstream franchise that outstayed its welcome. The series was a financial success so far, so I won't be surprised if it actually comes back. I'm just very, very doubtful to the whole thing, but that's me. Especially kids these days would probably like it though. I'm certain that the Shrek series has its fanbase, that's one thing that's sure. If you ask me, I would gladly be without it. 




 That specific quote seems a bit vague. It doesn't say that much for me. Sure, films that scar, make you feel something, stick with you or anything similar are usually those you remember the most and probably stick with you the longest than those movies that are mindless entertainment that you forget about the next day, but it can differ from person to person. People always look for different things in movies, it's always going to be that way. I think Michael Haneke had a great quote going on:      

*"Films that are entertainments give simple answers but I think that's ultimately more cynical, as it denies the viewer room to think. If there are more answers at the end, then surely it is a richer experience."*   

I have to say I agree with Haneke a lot. 




 I don't usually look for something specific and written in rock that a horror movie must have for me to like it. It always depends on what a horror movie does and how it does it, that's the main thing. It can be depth, interesting ideas, playfulness, a great atmosphere or anything that just makes me appretiate it a little extra. Horror movies are mostly best when they're not typical in their genre, but rather challenging, innovative, playful or just about anything that makes them stand out in a good way. I guess it's like with any genre, so it's hard to say. I like for example Possession (1981), Repulsion (1965), Spalovac mrtvol (1969), and Onibaba (1964).        

Now, Funny Games (1997) is maybe more of a thriller than a pure horror film, (and the boundaries can be discussed to death) but that's a great example of what I would like to see more of. Movies that are thinking one step ahead and actually have something interesting to say. 




 Which one are you referring to? Do you mean Lt den rtte komma in (2008) by Tomas Alfredson which has that as the English title? If you do, that's a Swedish movie and not a German one. 




 Som great and essential ones in my opinion:      

* Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes (1972)    
* Chronik der Anna Magdalena Bach (1968)      
* Das weie Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte (2009)     
* Der freie Wille (2006)      
* Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987)      
* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)       
* Faust: Eine deutsche Volkssage (1926)       
* Faustrecht der Freiheit (1975)      
* Im Lauf der Zeit (1976)     
* M (1931)      
* Metropolis (1927)      
* Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)    
* Stroszek (1977)       
* Tagebuch einer Verlorenen (1929)       

Keep an eye out when it comes to directors like Fritz Lang, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog, F.W. Murnau, and Wim Wenders, they have done some of the best stuff when it comes to German cinema. Especially Fassbinder, what a man! He has done many, many great movies. 




 De ofrivilliga (2008) is like Sweden and typical Swedish people in a nutshell. It's almost scary. 




 He's done some good stuff. With no doubt one of the best and coolest directors from Hong Kong for the moment. Maybe even overall. Chung Hing sam lam (1994), Fa yeung nin wa (2000) and Chun gwong cha sit (1997) are my favourites by him.Especially Fa yeung nin wa (2000) must be one of the best films post-2000. I really like the lightning in several of his movies and the use of colors. He's also good at contructing interesting characters that aren't simple and flat, but rather nuanced and at the same time giving the audience both small and fundamental questions about them. There's usually a lot of emotions in the films as well. I'm a bit curious and worried about his latest feature film, Yi dai zong shi (2013), the one about Ip Man, I have to see that one soon. It looks a bit different than some of his other movies. I'm not really a big fan of martial-arts films, so that could also be one reason for my hesitancy.    

When it comes to tracking down Kar-wai's films on DVD, it's quite easy. Criterion Collection released Fa yeung nin wa (2000) on Blu-ray too. And his other ones shouldn't be too hard to find if you look on Amazon and similar sites. I'm happy to help if you have trouble finding something!         

And if we are speaking of similar films, the ones I can think of for now are these three:       

* Bin-jip (2004)       
Kim Ki-duk's movies are mostly either a hit or a miss for me, but this one is probably his best. There's very little dialogue, but I find the relations of the characters to be something similar in the vein of the movies by Kar-wai.            

* Ai qing wan sui (1994)     
More dialogue than the Kim Ki-duk film, but Tsai Ming-liang is much better when it comes to having sparse dialogue. One must check out Tsai Ming-liang if one likes Wong Kar-wai! Ming-liang isn't as straightforward, but I always feel the need to recommend his films. And there's also that similar feeling when it comes to interactions with the characters.         

* Stranger Than Paradise (1984)       
Jim Jarmusch has that special coolness that we can see in Kar-wai as well. Very likeable stuff!     

I don't know if you have seen these three, but it will probably show! 




 It feels like the majority of the movies in that list are big movies people already know of and that already are quite popular on Reddit, for example The Godfather (1972), The Green Mile (1999), Reservoir Dogs (1992), No Country for Old Men (2007), American History X (1999), The Shawshank Redemption (1994) etc. It doesn't have to be a bad thing, but I would love to list some crime dramas that are some of my favourites outside of that list too:      

* Ascenseur pour l'chafaud (1958)     
* Blue Velvet (1986)      
* Du rififi chez les hommes (1955)     
* Le doulos (1962)      
* Le samoura (1967)    
* Le trou (1960)    
* Pickpocket (1959)    
* Pierrot le fou (1965)     
* The Limits of Control (2009)      
* Touchez pas au grisbi (1954)      

None of these are that obscure either, but they're not as well known as some of the big Hollywood classics in the list from the link, so maybe someone discovers something new from my recommendations as well. 




 Sayat Nova (1969) by Sergei Parajanov is a great one. It's a stylized, surreal and beautiful biography of the Armenian poet Sayat Nova. Parajanov was more interested in revealing the poet's life in a visual and poetic way rather than literally. One interesting fact is that Sofiko Chiaureli played six different characters in the movie. There's no real dialogue or any camera movement either. 




 I agree, this should be a standard everywhere. It would especially benefit those who have impaired hearing too. 




 A cracker. According to the Silent Era website, the survival status seems to be unknown, same with the current rights holder. Even the following is stated on the site: "It is unclear whether this film was actually produced."   


Your best shot will probably be to come in contact with the production company, Regia Kunstfilms Co. and/or DFI (Danish Film Institute) and see what they say. 




 Nobi (1959) by Kon Ichikawa is great. War, starvation, absurdity and chaos. 




 I wouldn't say that always suck, it really depends on how they are made etc. But there's of course a lot of bad examples. On the other hand, Andrei Tarkovsky made some of the most amazing dream sequences ever. Zerkalo (1975), Stalker (1979), Nostalghia (1983) and Offret (1986) have all great and beautiful dream sequences. 

Ingmar Bergman really said it:      
*"Tarkovsky for me is the greatest (director), the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream."* 




 Get some from Criterion Collection and Eureka (Masters of Cinema), they have a lot of great movies. L'eclisse (1962), Pickpocket (1959) and Seppuku (1962) are some that I really recommend. 




  Not your favorite movies, but the ones you think influenced the filmmaking industry, or are perfectly told stories.

That's making it a little irrelevant, complicated and strange. It's not always that or this way. Someones favourite movies could be perfectly told stories, the perfectly told stories one prefers could be movies the person thinks influenced filmmaking in big ways etc. Reasons can hang together and differ. For example, my favourite movies are the same as the ones I think are the best of all time. So here they are:      

1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)       
2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)    
3. L'eclisse (1962)     
4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     
5. Tanin no kao (1966)     
6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)       
7. Suna no onna (1964)        
8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)     
9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963)      
10. Stntang (1994)        




 Krhozat (1988) is great and there's a lot of rain in it. 




  He would often ask his actors to perform the same scene 60 times in a row, until all pretensions of acting and "constructedness" would disappear and what would be left were the words, plain and simple.    

This isn't completely true. It's mostly a rumour people spread around, that he made them repeat something like that so much. In Ingela Romare's book about Bresson, there is a long interview with him where he said that it's false and just rumour about his way of working. He simply made his models utter a sentence and asked them to not think about what they were saying. He could also ask them to think about something else than the content in what they were saying.      




 I think you are missing a lot. First of all, to understand Robert Bresson you have to forget all about how a film "should be". I suggest reading Notes sur le cinmatographe (also published in English as Notes on the Cinematographer), there you will find his own kind of "rules", formulas and guidelines when it comes to cinema. He used it a lot in his own films. Robert Bresson despised the way in which the majority of films were made. He was of the opinion that the majority of cinema was filmed theatre, that's why he created a new sort of film language, his own cinematography. I would also suggest to not even think of comparing Lynch with him, that's just pointless from the beginning. Both of them have made some great films, but they don't have much in common at all. To make it easier, Bresson's style doesn't have much in common with much at all.           

Bresson wanted to separate cinema from the theater, he stripped the cinema to only the bare essentials. He was quite interested in other artforms, such as literature and painting, so much in his style is influenced from those fields rather than film. Look at the acting for example. The people in Bresson's movies were called models by him, he didn't want to call them actors at all. The point with his kind of "acting" was to make the models say their lines in a kind of automatic way, which didn't have focus on them making a performance, but rather acheiving automatism. In my opinion, this also had an effect that made it subtle, powerful and raw. And therefore it also left room to fill the characters with your own emotions, aside from those you already got from the beginning.     

The people in his movies were taken from life, Bresson required that they didn't have any connection to film or theater. Have in mind that I mostly speak of his later films now, his earlier movies were not made the same way. Anyways, he used people which were not taught to be natural. Classic acting had a learned naturalness, something which was absurd to him. The people in his films were supposed to be (models), not pretend to be (actors). Bresson even tried to not use the same model twice. Everything from the theatrical expressions was meant to be taken away, that was the point in which Bresson wanted to bring out the authenticity, a realism in the way of just being human. Facial expressions, movements, gestures and voices, everything was supposed to be as neutral as possible. This is something that was the total opposite of typical acting, because Bresson felt that typical acting was closer to the theater than to cinema. A person who has been indoctrinated in the theater when it comes to expression, that person can't show genuine emotions on screen, that would just be emotions that have been learned, which equals fake emotions. Bresson was interested in the purely "physical" in people. He didn't tell which feelings he wanted his models to show, he just gave them physical instructions such as how the model should move, what the model should look at etc.      

He was also a perfectionist and a minimalist. That means every image, sound, move etc. is supposed to be there and has its own meaning of being there. This is why many of his movies are a bit shorter than your average flick. This guy stripped cinema to the bare essentials, but still managed to make huge art. The thing with Bresson is the special relationship between images and sounds together with important questions about human beings, it's so special that you won't really find it anywhere else, not like in his movies. It's just pure film magic in my opinion. Some people can watch films all their life and still not understand Bresson, which isn't shocking at all, because you really need to study his style to truly understand him, I'm almost certain that you barely scratched the surface of this man and his movies, especially if you think his visual style is "dull", that it's "lacking" and when you say you don't see the point. Study, read his book, watch his films, and examine critically. This can take years, but understanding Bresson isn't something you do after two or three of his movies. It takes time. We are not talking about taste now, have that in mind. We are just talking about understanding. I also have a great book about him by Ingela Romare, but it's in Swedish, so it's a bit hard to recommend if it isn't your first language. There may be something else you could find in English though (besides his own book). Anyways, If you have the interest to understanding Bresson properly, you have to commit and do it properly. Good luck if you want it. And don't rush. 














 I think it will suck too. Just like the first one. It was just silly and trying too hard. Talk about cheap jokes. No finesse or charm whatsoever. 




 Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) by Lav Diaz. 




 You maybe feel that way because the movies by John Carpenter and George Romero were a big influence on the film's compositions and visual aesthetic. Wide-angle lenses were also used to help give the film its look. The soundtrack obviously echoes Carpenter too. 




 Here are all of them:       

* Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)        
* Chinatown (1974)      
* Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)      
* The Godfather: Part II (1974)

 One of the best westerns ever made. Amazing soundtrack and memorable characters. A true classic that's very rewatchable. I got sad when I heard that Eli Wallach died. It's almost been a year now. 




 It was quite silly, yeah. But I didn't really expect it to be great, especially as Nolan never impressed me before. I find him quite mediocre. I have been talking about it in some threads before, so I'm probably going to repeat myself, but I disliked Interstellar (2014) mostly because Nolan seems to be unable to tell with pictures. Everything is already explained with dialogue and/or voice-over, there is nothing left to the imagination. But that's probably because the film is so flat and empty that there isn't anything left to leave to the viewer. To make it as unsubtle and clear as possible seems to be Nolan's last hope of deceiving himself and the audience that there is something in the movie and that it's smart.      
Matthew McConaughey's character is paraphrasing and saying that the world only consists of crafsmen, but lacks of visionaries. That's quite funny, because Nolans doesn't really have any visions at all.      

The soundtrack by Zimmer is also all over the place and so pompous and nobby that it feels more like a parody. On top of that, the screenplay had ancient gender roles, doubtful New Age philosophy about love and a lot of silly crying.     

About the IMDb Top 250, that's something one shouldn't pay attention to at all. Everyone can make an account and start voting on that site. A lot of the votes are corrupt, people create fake accounts, some users only use 1 and 10 when rating etc. It's hard to take it seriously, the whole top list is better off being ignored. Another thing, you don't have to be missing something just because you didn't like a movie, it can rather be the movie that's missing something. Everything doesn't have to be so single sided. 














 Hulu Plus seems to be something for you. They pretty much have nearly everything Criterion released and some more. Fandor and Mubi could be something worth looking into also. Another thing to consider is visiting libraries, they actually have more stuff than you think. It's of course not the same everywhere, but it's worth a shot. Don't forget about YouTube either, you can find a lot of classic films there. Many are in the public domain, so those are free and totally legal. 




 George Clooney's first film wasn't From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). He started acting in the late seventies, made his first role ever in 1978 (in a mini-series) and his first movie role in And They Are Off (1982). 




 Threse three are great and a lot more mature than the typical fantasy stuff:       

* Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987)      
* Duelle (une quarantaine) (1976)   
* Ugetsu monogatari (1953)        




 Wu Wu Mian (2015) by Tsai Ming-liang, great short. You can watch it here:         
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2MJ68jedKc 




 Ten of my favourite ones:    

* Eraserhead (1977)     
* Hxan (1922)                      
* Les diaboliques (1955)            
* Les yeux sans visage (1960)                
* Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)                     
* Onibaba (1964)              
* Possession (1981)          
* Repulsion (1965)              
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)                 
* Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)             




 It's going to be a lot of movies for you if everyone is going to give you three films from each year starting from 2000 until now. And of the ones I have seen and rated from that span, I haven't given a single one more than a 4/5 rating, and those that got it are less than forty movies all together. So I'm going to give you fifteen of the best films I have seen from 2000 until now that I really recommend:       

* A torini l (2011)          
* Book chon bang hyang (2011)    
* Cach (2005)     
* Das weie Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte (2009)             
* Fa yeung nin wa (2000)     
* Mies vailla menneisyytt (2002)     
* Mulholland Dr.	(2001)       
* My Winnipeg (2007)     
* Ni neibian jidian (2001)       
* No Quarto da Vanda (2000)       
* Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)      
* The Act of Killing (2012)      
* The Limits of Control (2009)      
* Werckmeister harmnik (2000)          
* White Material (2009)       




 I'm not really surprised. 




  This Transient Life (1970)      

I have to rewatch that one soon. So damn good! 









 Yaju no seishun (1963). Seijun Suzuki did some good action in the 60s. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989). 




 I haven't seen Transformers (2007) yet. 




 No female character's dream, big motivation, ambition or idea, is really truly their own. They're not really independent. It's quite interesting to consider that the role of Murph was originally written for a male too. But that later changed. Anyways, what I am trying to say is that the independence of the women in the film only go so far as to make it work mostly for the big male figure in their existance. The women are dependant on their so called hopes to make their special big male figure proud, and in the end also to complete his lifelong dream, not really their own.     
Much of the movie moves along according to men and that they are the dynamic ones, which leaves women in reactive positions. Every woman seems to be forced to hold onto the hand of the big male figure that abandoned them. None of the women would have their ambitious striving without a so called strong, adventurous, independent and lovable male lead. To make it short, this is just some of the problems the movie has, so I hope I have given you some answers to your curiosity. 




 I agree that it's overrated. I dislike it mostly because Nolan is unable to tell with pictures. Everything is already explained with dialogue and/or voice-over, there is nothing left to the imagination. There is nothing that is subtle. The soundtrack by Zimmer is just all over the place and so pompous and nobby that it feels more like a parody. On top of that, the screenplay had tiresome gender roles, doubtful New Age philosophy about love and a lot of crying. 




 The movie you are looking for is Kurutta ippji (1926) by Teinosuke Kinugasa. Good stuff. I recently got it on DVD, but the transfer wasn't really that good. It really deserves a nice restoration, a Blu-ray release would be amazing. It's just sad that the existing print of it is missing a big part of the film too. By the way, when it was screened in Japan in the 1920s, it would have included live narration by a storyteller or so called benshi as well as musical accompaniment. 




 This is what you should be looking after:     
  
* A torini l (2011)       
* Der siebente Kontinent (1989)     
* Krhozat (1988)     
* Nattvardsgsterna (1963)     
* L'amour  mort (1984)       
* Le feu follet (1963)      
* No Quarto da Vanda (2000)     
* Offret (1986)       
* Petla (1958)      
* Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986)       
* Stntang (1994)       
* Viskningar och rop (1972)     
* Werckmeister harmnik (2000)      




 Woody Allen. 




 One of the most beautiful movies I've watched this year is Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969). Amazing cinematography. It doesn't make it worse that it's a very complex and interesting look at sex, history and politics. It's what I would call aesthetic perfection! Some user here on Reddit posted an album with screenshots from it, here is a (NSFW) link: http://imgur.com/a/MAxel          




 I'm guessing it could be Rak ti Khon Kaen (2015) by Apichatpong Weerasethakul. But if Lav Diaz, Michael Haneke and Abbas Kiarostami all come out with a new film this year, it could be one of theirs. 




 Easy one. Max von Sydow. One of his most memorable roles for me is as Karl Oskar in Utvandrarna (1971) and Nybyggarna (1972) by Jan Troell. 




 "Top-tier" directors is maybe subjective, I would for example not put Guy Ritchie anywhere near the top of anything. And well known doesn't always mean that someone is good, so we have that part too.

But to answer your question, I think Jeanne Moreau would probably be the hardest one to beat in the first place. Just look at this list of the directors she has worked with: 

* Michelangelo Antonioni    
* Luis Buuel   
* Louis Malle      
* Jacques Becker   
* Marguerite Duras    
* Tsai Ming-liang   
* Jean Renoir       
* Rainer Werner Fassbinder   
* Manoel de Oliveira      
* Franois Truffaut    
* Marcel Ophls      
* Joseph Losey      
* Orson Welles   
* Elia Kazan      
* Theo Angelopoulos    
* Wim Wenders     




 Bronenosets Potemkin (1925) by Sergei M. Eisenstein. The ultimate one. One of the most influential films in the history of cinema, the montage techniques in it are as relevant and important today as it was in the 1920s. Early propaganda movies from the Soviet Union is what you should look into if you want to see montage editing at its best. 




 Il sorpasso (1962). Great road movie about an impulsive and extroverted excitement seeker who meets an introverted and straitlaced law student. A hell of a ride. 




 Have you seen Smultronstllet (1957) by Ingmar Bergman? If not, that is the ultimate one. 




 I think it was because of the cover art and/or the extras. 




 Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987) is probably the best one. A great portrait of the contemporary West Berlin from the eighties.     

Some other ones that are very good:       

* Der letzte Mann (1924)         
* Despair (1978)          
* Die Ehe der Maria Braun (1979)       
* Die dritte Generation (1979)      
* M (1931)      
* Possession (1981)      

Worth mentioning too:       

* Germania anno zero (1948)       
* Menschen am Sonntag (1930)     
* Variet (1925)        

I would also recommend to check out Fassbinder's massive and epic Berlin Alexanderplatz (1980) if you have the time. It's more of a mini-series, but was made to be a single film, so the limitations can be discussed on that part, but it's a very interesting depiction of Berlin in the late-1920s. All hail Fassbinder! 




 It was already announced two months ago, it was just postponed a bit. 









 Mulholland Dr. (2001) is a must watch. 




 None of them. I watch what I want to watch. I have never used those sites to be sure if I should watch anything or not. 









 Some of my absolute favourite war films:            

* Apocalypse Now (1979)       
* Csillagosok, katonk (1967)       
* Idi i smotri (1985)      
* Ivanovo detstvo (1962)       
* L'arme des ombres (1969)        
* La battaglia di Algeri (1966)       
* Lacombe Lucien (1974)       
* Nobi (1959)      
* Paths of Glory (1957)      
* Popil i diament (1958)       
* Voskhozhdenie (1977)         




 Solyaris (1972), the best movie ever when it comes to space and science fiction. 




 I think I would choose Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969). It would probably be amazing. 




 Favourite actress: Setsuko Hara	   
Favourite actor: Chish Ry         
Favourite director: Andrei Tarkovsky       
Favourite movie: Der siebente Kontinent (1989)        




 I rather feel that bland visuals, no emotions, doing many things and the loud and clear message also applies to movies that aren't independent. I can see these kind of things in both independent movies and the big mainstream blockbusters from Hollywood for example. So the so called mistakes are quite common in pretty much films of all kinds, I don't think they should only be paired together with movies that are independent. The indie label just states that a movie is produced outside of the major film studio system, completely or partly, it doesn't actually say anything else, something that many people believe. Also, if someone feels that a movie is incomprehensible, it doesn't have to be the director's mistake, it could rather be the viewer's fault, something worth to remember. It doesn't always have to be that one sided. 




 1. Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)      
2. Book chon bang hyang (2011)     
3. A torini l (2011)        




 I don't know where you got something Japanese from. Maybe you answered the wrong person? Funny Games (1997) is an Austrian movie in German. The remake is in English. 




 Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) by Lav Diaz is the best movie I've seen from the last two years. Really great. I can really recommend it. 




 Yeah, you could say that. 




 It's not really that different. Actors and the language aren't the same, but that's mostly it. They're both directed by Haneke. The remake was just aimed for the American audience. 









 Funny Games (1997) is some good stuff. 




 Yaj no seishun (1963) or Buta to gunkan (1961). 




 Some of the better ones working today:   

* Abbas Kiarostami          
* Aki Kaurismki	      
* Aleksandr Sokurov         
* Apichatpong Weerasethakul      
* David Lynch      
* Hirokazu Koreeda     
* Hong Sang-soo       
* Jafar Panahi      
* Jean-Luc Godard       
* Jim Jarmusch       
* Lav Diaz      
* Michael Haneke   
* Pedro Costa          
* Peter Greenaway    
* Tsai Ming-liang         




 I can't see the real challenge in it. It isn't as hard as you may think. Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972), Tky monogatari (1953), La libertad (2001), Le rvlateur (1968), Bu san (2003), and Akibiyori (1960) are some examples I can think of after some seconds. And they don't have any certain plot holes really. Also, there's a lot of more experimental/avant-garde movies that could fit, same with many shorts. My examples were movies with a more standard narrative though. It all depends on where you want to draw the line and how picky you want to be. 




 My favourite is La jete (1962) by Chris Marker. 




 * Andrey Rublyov (1966)    
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)    
* Stntang (1994)     




 It sounds like When a Stranger Calls Back (1993) by Fred Walton, could it be it? 




 Naked Lunch (1991) and Where the Buffalo Roam (1980). 









 I don't think it's odd at all. I think it's rather great that people dress however they want when they're directing a movie and not going after some special dress code. There's no reason for it. It can get rather hectic, hot, excruciating and stressful on a movie set, therefore people probably show up in what feels best and comfortable for them in that kind of situation. Taste is also subjective. 




 La jete (1962) by Chris Marker and Je t'aime je t'aime (1968) by Alain Resnais. 




 Here are five of the best ones I have seen:     

* Csillagosok, katonk (1967)    
* J'accuse! (1919)     
* Paths of Glory (1957)   
* La grande illusion (1937)    
* The Big Parade (1925)         




 Still hoping for Woody Allen. 




 Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. A true masterpiece. 




 Some great examples I really like:

* Les rendez-vous d'Anna (1978)         
Anna, a female director is on tour for her newest film. She goes from France to Germany and back to Paris. While in Germany, she travels around there a bit and we get to see the people she meets.         

* Saraba natsu no hikari (1968)     
Kawamura is a professor touring Europe. He meets Naoko, a married woman living in Paris, scarred by the Nagasaki atomic bombings. A romance blooms and they travel around Europe trying to find themselves.        

* Stroszek (1977)        
Street singer and former mental patient Bruno teams up with a prostitute and an older man to travel from Germany to the United States in search for a better life.        

* Topio stin omichli (1988)       
A road movie about two children (Voula and Alexandre) searching for their father who dissapeared, but is supposed to live in Germany.     




 You have to check out Posetitel muzeya (1989) and Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986) by Konstantin Lopushanskiy. Both have a very similar post-apocalyptic vibe. Lopushanskiy also worked as a production assistant on Stalker (1979). 




 Dreyer! Thumbs up. Such a great movie. 
























 I think it's a bit unfair to call that list "The Ultimate List" or anything similar as the user behind the list did. And it's also strange and irrelevant to base it that heavily on awards on nominations. Also, there's pretty much only English language movies in the list. Of course, they don't only speak English in The Pianist (2002), but you probably get my point. It would be better to call it something else, maybe "Top 100 English language movies based on awards/nominations, popularity and a bit of critical acclaim". 




 Here's my list:   

1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)       
2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)      
3. L'eclisse (1962)      
4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     
5. Tanin no kao (1966)    
6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)      
7. Suna no onna (1964)     
8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)    
9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963)    
10. Stntang (1994)     




 Probably this one:    

http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/directors/ 




 I didn't like it at all. The storytelling is very episodic, bombastic, clear and quite boring with no interesting finesse or nuances, but rather ends up being forced and obviously dramatic. I felt the characters were pretty thin too. Even if Russell Crowe does his role good, it doesn't help the film for me. It's hard to realize that the same director did the much, much better Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), I suggest watching that instead if you want to see Weir when he actually is doing a good movie. 




 On of my favourites. So damn great. 









 The Room (2003). 




 Yeah, Claire Denis doing science fiction isn't the first thing you expected today. Interesting. 














 You don't know if you can go through Federico Fellini's career, but you had no problem with Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen considering they've done even more films? Heh.   

Anyways, have you done Andrei Tarkovsky? If not, do it! 




 Well, you can always start with some of most important and critically acclaimed directors. Get to know directors like Jean Renoir, Claude Chabrol, Alain Resnais, Franois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Eric Rohmer, Robert Bresson, Louis Malle and the others, read about their films and explore a bit on your own. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_France) article on Wikipedia will give you a brief overview of the history, that is to say if you are interesting. It's not that much, but I think it really helps to know about the important names and just have a little backstory to everything.    



Anyways,  bout de souffle (1960) by Jean-Luc Godard and Les quatre cents coups (1959) by Franois Truffaut are two classic French films that one must watch when it comes to French cinema. They are quite easy to like and will offer you a good start. 




 The Limits of Control (2009) by Jim Jarmusch is in my opinion of the best films post-2000. Why? I think it's very misunderstood by many critics and a big majority of the public. But of course, there are those who just don't like it.     

I remember that Jarmusch said that it was an action movie without action, which I think is a fitting description. I simply love how Jarmusch is playing with the thriller/spy genre and at the same time pissing on the conventions. He takes away sex, weapons and cell phones, and there you have the three most used attributes of modern action movies removed. We also never come close to the threat we get hinted at. American agents are following the main protagonist, another character gets abducted, we see a helicopter in the sky, but Jarmusch never puts any importance to those things, which is great and liberating considering how they still are a part of the film. He moves within the thriller genre, but leaves out the parts that are loved by the mainstream movie viewers.      

Without spoiling too much, there's a certain scene in the film where there would be non-stop action in an ordinary action movie because of the circumstances, but Jarmusch even denounces action at that point too, he just puts imagination to use instead, which I feel is one of the main things the film is trying to say, that imagination is unstoppable. It's probably the best middle finger ever made to the viewers who always want everything explained to them. Brilliant. Also, Sunn O)))   Boris are part of the soundtrack, which just makes it better, as well as all the references to film and art in general. And the cinematography is just top-notch. 




 La Tour Montparnasse Infernale (2001). 




 You don't know about it? In my opinion, it's one of the best films ever made. It's directed by Andrei Tarkovsky and is loosely based on the life of the great 15th-century Russian icon painter that had the same name as the movie's title. While it's a biography, it's also a depiction of a very dark period in the Russian history marked by endless fighting between rival Princes and by Tatar invasions. 




 Andrey Rublyov (1966) would probably have been amazing. 









  How important is a movie-villain?       

Not at all. But that totally depends on what kind of movie it is and in which context you want to put the question in. There's plenty of movies that have a villain as an important part of the plot, and also plenty others that don't focus on that kind of classic plot at all. If a movie has a villain, I would say that it's usually always more appretiated with a villain that has nuances and depth than a villain that is just straight evil. Although it also depends on how the movie is handling it and how other parts work together with it.    


I'm not a fan of Gladiator (2000), but it was also many years ago I saw it, so I can't really say anything special about it. But different movies with villains handles them differently, I think that's the basic thing one has to acknowledge. And I guess it's good that you yourself can point out what you liked and not liked with the villains in those two movies. 




 * Il sorpasso (1962)      
* Im Lauf der Zeit (1976)      
* Pierrot le fou (1965)        




 Really? It's on lists like The 100 Greatest Sci-Fi Movies, 100 Science Fiction Films (BFI Screen Guide), AFI's 100 years...100 thrills, AFI's 100 years...100 cheers, Empire 500, Spike Lee's Essential Film List, The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made, The Guardian's 1000 Films to See Before You Die, They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?, Reddit top 250, FOK! top 250, The British Film Institute: 360 Classics, 501 Must See Movies (from the book with the same name), 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, both the directors and critics Sight and Sound 2012, David Thomson's Have You Seen? A Personal Introduction to 1,000 Films, and probably many, many more.     

The fact that it made the Reddit top 250 probably says that it's quite loved on a site like this. And many of the other lists are already proving that many critics like it as well, just to take some examples. 




 Great movie, but is it that unconventional to see in those kinds of list? You can see it on MovieSense 101, Reddit top 250, FilmTotaal top 250, Empire 500, The Guardian's 1000 Films to See Before You Die, FOK! top 250, They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?, Sight and Sound 2012 (both the Directors list and Critics list), 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, OFCS Top 100: 100 Best First Films, and Jonathan Rosenbaum's Essential Films to take some examples. 




 Here's my top ten list:        


1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)     
2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)       
3. L'eclisse (1962)      
4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     
5. Tanin no kao (1966)       
6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)      
7. Suna no onna (1964)    
8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)     
9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963)      
10. Stntang (1994)       




 Well, there's several sites that you can use to keep track of the movies you have seen. IMDb, Letterboxd, ICheckMovies etc. Some have more functions than others. I can't see the weird thing in it. 




 How do you mean? It's quite simple. For example, you rate movies and keep track of that. Then you make a top 250 with the best ones every year, or whenever you want. 




 [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0stXu60iVE) one from Offret (1986). 




 If I have to choose one, I would go with They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?:    
http://www.theyshootpictures.com/gf1000_all1000films_table.php       

To say it quite simple:     
*"The They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? 1,000 greatest films list is primarily compiled by using 1,825 individual critics' and filmmakers' best-films-of-all-time lists/ballots. The resulting list is very diverse and spans virtually all movie-producing decades and countries."*      

I've seen almost every movie, and I can say myself that it's indeed a quite diverse list with tons of great and important movies. Many of my absolute favourites are on it. It'll give you a great overview of cinema in general. 




 Have you seen Andrei Tarkovsky's movies? He was great when it comes to using and putting dream sequences into his films. Stalker (1979), Zerkalo (1975) and Nostalgia (1983) all have them for example. Especially Zerkalo (1975) has a great flow when it combines dreams with contemporary scenes, memories and newsreel footage. 




 Because 90 critics gave it a positive ("fresh") rating and 11 gave it a negative ("rotten) one, so the percentage of positive reviews is calculated by that. You can read how the Tomatometer works on their website or on the Wikipedia page. Sometimes people seem to misunderstand how it works, I don't know if that's the case with you. Also, you could probably get some more insight when it comes to what some of the critics liked about it if you just read the reviews. You simply didn't like, and that's it. That's how it can be sometimes. 




 Fitzcarraldo (1982) by Werner Herzog. 




 Welt am Draht (1973) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder is my favourite. 




 It's a bit cryptic, but if you decontruct the film, there's a lot of political content to be found. Maybe [this](http://www.filmcomment.com/article/endgame-michael-hanekes-cache) article can help you understand everything a bit better. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6MJhwGLFQ) also an interesting video Dan North did that's about the film and the content that could help as well. 




 A splendid and great movie I hold very high. Filled with rain, loneliness and despair. The bar scene with the singer is amazing, one of my favourite movie scenes of all time. 




 Heh, I just posted a message about this some hours ago in the thread about the film. And as I already said, it probably means that the rights for showing it on television in the United States are cleared. So I guess we won't have to wait too long for a Criterion release. Too bad that I'm not in the US, so I don't think I can see it when it airs, but I'm glad that I have at least seen the movie once. It's a great one. Let's hope Qing mei zhu ma (1985) by Yang gets a nice restoration as well. 




 I don't necessarily see a slow pace being something bad or a disadvantage. Rather the opposite, it gives time to appretiate things like sound, the images, lightning, editing (especially if it's good and/or interesting) etc., it also gives me time to think and feel. I'm not in a hurry. The scenes are in the exact pace that Kubrick meant them to be. In real life, things move as they do, and a big part of cinema does mimic that. Sometimes movies could also invoke a feeling of immersion of time, something that Tarkovsky was good at for example, the feeling of being lost in time in the film. 




 When you say "have watched most things", it makes me wonder a bit. That's quite vague. Anyways, it's an entertaining, funny and good little flick, no more, no less. I wouldn't put it up as one of the best films ever made, quite very fram from it, and nothing I would put in my top 250 for example, but it's not a bad movie at all. Another thing, there's a newer TV series with the same name that's quite interesting too, it's inspired by the film, but has an anthology format. 




 All these things are very easy to find using Google. Yes, I know it's an easy answer, but you are demanding quite much. I don't think anyone here will have the time to spell out everything for you. It's very hard to know what you will be asked exactly. It's also even harder to give out certain moments, because there's really quite much information.    

Read some here:    
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_film      

Mark Cousins did an interesting documentary about the history of cinema, The Story of Film: An Odyssey (2011). It gives you a rough overview and goes through all of the decades with important movements, directors, key moments etc. It's a bit long, but as I said, it's very hard to cover so much if you have limitations. That's probably your best shot (plus the Wikipedia article) if you want to keep it simple. There's a ton of essays on what people think stands out with Kubrick, his importance and so on. Again, Google is great. 




 Lars von Trier's Melancholia (2011) had some great CGI that worked well. Examples:     
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOXNPovY6yE 




 Robert Bresson wasn't really a part of the French New Wave. He was a big influence though. And some directors hailed him as some sort of prototype or precursor to the movement, which I think is a better description. First of all, Bresson wasn't that outwardly experimental and not as politically extrovert as some of the New Wave directors. You also have his religious views (Catholicism and Jansenism) that didn't really fit in that much with the other filmmakers associated with the movement, especially not considering the youthful iconoclasm that New Wave films often had. And even though he wasn't outwardly experimental, his films were quite different from the typical New Wave films, but that's mostly because of his own rules he established to use in his movies. 




 I think I prefer Das weie Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte (2009) more than Cach (2005). Do you mean that Cach (2005) didn't give you answers enough? Or anything else? I wouldn't really call it a lack, it's just the way Haneke works. He just doesn't provide you with simple answer, that's one of the best things with many of his films. 




 Well, it isn't necessarily that I don't like it, it's more that I'm deliberate when it comes to my grades. Also, I've only rated 367 movies from the 2010s, which isn't that much maybe. So there's a lot that I haven't seen yet too. Anyways, it doesn't change the fact that a 3/5 still is a good movie for me. 




 Not a big fan of him, but Se7en (1995) is decent. 




 Well it seems my top ten would look like this together with the ratings:    

1. Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) (Lav Diaz) 4/5      
2. Book chon bang hyang (2011) (Hong Sang-soo) 4/5   
3. A torini l (2011) (Bla Tarr) 4/5      
4. Amour (2012) (Michael Haneke) 4/5     
5. Da-reun na-ra-e-seo (2012) (Hong Sang-soo) 4/5         
6. The Act of Killing (2012) (Joshua Oppenheimer) 4/5     
7. Dupa dealuri (2012) (Cristian Mungiu) 4/5     
8. Jodaeiye Nader az Simin (2011) (Asghar Farhadi) 4/5        
9. Le Havre (2011) (Aki Kaurismki) 4/5     
10. Like Someone in Love (2012) (Abbas Kiarostami) 3/5     




 Ten of the best ones:       

* A torini l (2011)     
* Book chon bang hyang (2011)     
* Cach (2005)       
* Das weie Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte (2009)      
* Jodaeiye Nader az Simin (2011)      
* My Winnipeg (2007)        
* Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)     
* The Act of Killing (2012)     
* The Limits of Control (2009)       
* White Material (2009)       




 The movie is scheduled to be shown on TCM in the beginning of September:    
http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/511703/Brighter-Summer-Day-A/         

This probably means that the rights for showing it on television in the United States are cleared. So let's hope it won't be too long for a release. I just can't wait. It's a great movie that is begging for a Criterion treatment. 




 When it comes to horror, I would say that some of my absolute favourites are mandatory:       

* Eraserhead (1977)
* Hxan (1922)
* Les diaboliques (1955)
* Les yeux sans visage (1960)
* Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)
* Onibaba (1964)
* Possession (1981)
* Repulsion (1965)
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)
* Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968) 




 What do you mean exactly? It's a bit hard to tell. Of what I recall, the AMPAS started to nominate foreign language performances in 1960, with the first award given 1961. And from 1960 to 1966, Setsuko Hara did her last eight films. So she never had so much chance to get nominated and/or awarded for example. Then you also have the rule that films must have been commercially released in Los Angeles County and have English subtitles with the theatrical release etc., which can be a factor in cases like these. Anyways, I never measure the quality of a performance based on nominations/awards from the Academy Awards, I was just answering the question OP asked. 














 Your title basically says exactly the same thing about the ending as your post. If you want a discussion, you should probably point out why you thought the ending was shitty and what you were dissapointed with. 




 It is. But OP just asked where one can stream good quality movies for free, not pirated ones. There's a lot of stuff out there that is entirely free and legal to stream on various sites. 




 Actor: Chish Ry     
Actress: Setsuko Hara 




 My Winnipeg (2007) by Guy Maddin. 




 https://www.youtube.com/    
https://archive.org/index.php      
http://www.hulu.com/ also lets you stream some movies with a free account. 




 My single favourite one is L'eclisse (1962) by Michelangelo Antonioni. A great exploration of alienation, loneliness, doomed love, the inability to communicate, materialistic natures, and emptiness, all together with a poetic and hauntingly beautiful visual style and top-notch acting. 




 Sylvester Stallone himself has been a big collector of knives for a long time, it's quite known. So that explains the connection with knives in some of the movies he acted in. 




 A similar thread was created some hours ago, but it was only about gay and lesbian movies about relationships, but I have the same answer for this question, so I'll quote myself:     

*"Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. No doubt about it. I just love how the whole film takes place in one location and I love the long takes and how uncompromisingly shot it is. A film where only women take part in, drowned in decadence, power games and German angst. It's just so intense and amazing."* 




 I always find it so strange when people ask these kind of questions, why certain movies received so much bad criticism. Read the reviews, you'll probably found several ones where people point out why they didn't like it etc. It's as easy as that.     

Look here to find a lot of external reviews from all over the world:    
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1823672/externalreviews     

There's also sites like Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes etc. If you want reviews from every Tom, Dick and Harry, just check out the user reviews on IMDb. And as I said in a similar thread, it doesn't always have to be you that's missing something because you like/dislike a movie and a big majority of people have another opinion, taste is subjective.    

I myself didn't like the movie at all. If you wonder why, I'll just copy a short summary of what I wrote in an older thread about it:        

*"I thought it was quite bad. For a narrative film of this kind and for it to be an allegory of interest, the story was too simple sided and superficial. In the end, I couldn't care less about anything. The whole movie felt something like a promotional commercial for Die Antwoord, which was silly. And quite everything actually felt silly, stupid, hollow and over the top in a bad way. From the pathetic dialogue to the action and to how it was shot. It's hard to take it seriously, because it doesn't work as a comedy or any kind of critique of something either. It makes me wonder if Blomkamp offered someone from junior high to write him the dialogue."* 




 Well, I would suggest this link for you:   
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110632/externalreviews        

It links a big amount of external reviews of the movie. Some people like it more than others, some people dislike it more than others. But going through some reviews might help you see exactly what other people like in the film. 




  I was never in to Noir films, then again, I've never seen one    

Well, you pretty much explained it yourself, heh. I myself would recommend looking into Touch of Evil (1958), Double Indemnity (1944) and The Third Man (1949), some of my own film noir favourites. All three are quite mandatory if you have the slightest interest in cinema at all. Sunset Blvd. (1950) is also a must see, even though it isn't one of my personal favourites, it's still important. If you are interested, film noir is well worth looking into, the 40s and 50s were two of the greatest decades for Hollywood in my opinion. 









 Art Theatre Guild. To start with, the connection with the Japanese New Wave is of course essential, a movement which I am really fond of. ATG's production system always put the art of moviemaking in the centre. All of the projects were selected solely on their artistic merits, nothing else. ATG was also totally free from the structures and conventions of the mainstream Japanese studio system, so the movies released by ATG often had focus on interesting, rich, nuanced, experimental and radical explorations of sex, violence, politics, and social revolution. And with films like Mujo (1970), Kshikei (1968) and Bara no sretsu (1969) to take some examples, the films usually had very high quality the them. Nagisa shima, Akio Jissoji, Shhei Imamura, Toshio Matsumoto, Yoshishige Yoshida, Kaneto Shind, Kji Wakamatsu, and Shji Terayama are just some of the directors that were affiliated with ATG. And that's some of the best ones from Japan. 




 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mortal_Instruments 




 My favourite movie is Der siebente Kontinent (1989) by Michael Haneke. For those who haven't seen it, it's about a middle-class couple that's living together with their daughter. They dream of escaping to Australia to start a new life. Their current life is monotonous and full of routines, but they decide to do something about it one day. First of all, I love the form and how uncompromising it is. There is no soundtrack, so the little music that exists in the film is diegetic. The color palette is very dry and bleak, just like the overall atmosphere. Haneke takes his time by telling the story with long and static takes instead of moving the camera, which I'm a big fan of, I think that just adds to the form and connects well with the monotonous life of the family. There's no clear answers, which I also admire Haneke for, he is great when it comes to asking important questions and making his audience think and feel.       
There's no other movie that made me feel as much as this one. It's just crushing. It's like a punch in the gut. Der siebente Kontinent (1989) also gives some interesting discussions about alienation, existentialism, society and materialism. One of my favourite scenes is the one with the family sitting and just staring while their TV is on with the song "The Power of Love" playing, a wonderful juxtaposition considering the nihilistic tone and depressing atmosphere the movie actually has.     
I can go on talking about it a bit more, but I'm not going to spoil out everything here, so this will do as for now. In my opinion, this movie is simply amazing and a true masterpiece. 









 I don't get why you are questioning if you are missing something or not, especially not when it comes to a movie like this. It doesn't have to be you that's missing something if you didn't like a film. It's a franchise that already has a big fan base and a big amount of the general public is probably going to love it, that's easy to figure out. Also, it's a big mainstream Hollywood movie draped in CGI that seemed rather problematic and flawed just by looking at the trailer, did you really expect a cinematic masterpiece? And of what I have seen, there's been some critique here on Reddit about it, so I wouldn't say that the movie is as loved as you seem to think. 




 Here's 15 great movies that have stunning visual styles:

 There was a similar thread in the Criterion subreddit, although it concerned their own releases only. But my number one favourite still remains the same outside of that collection, so I'll just qoute myself and repeat what I said about it:    

*"Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. No doubt about it. I just love how the whole film takes place in one location and I love the long takes and how uncompromisingly shot it is. A film where only women take part in, drowned in decadence, power games and German angst. It's just so intense and amazing."* 




 Film Art: An Introduction by David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson is a good start if you are new to film analysis. It goes through the basic stuff pretty much in a quite accessible way. It also has several other references which can help you go further in your quest. You can find it pretty much everywhere. If you don't have the money, check out your local library for example. 




 When you mention American Beauty (1999) and Eyes Wide Shut (1999), I think of The Ice Storm (1997), Mulholland Dr. (2001) and Happiness (1998). 




 Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. No doubt about it. I just love how the whole film takes place in one location and I love the long takes and how uncompromisingly shot it is. A film where only women take part in, drowned in decadence, power games and German angst. It's just so intense and amazing. 




 And I would like to take the opportunity to recommend one of my favourites, Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Fantastic movie. 









 Looks like a movie where the white men are supposed to be the heroes when they are saving the other white people from the foreigners. Hooray. And of course, the main point is probably that we should care the most for the priviliged white American nuclear family. While this could be a great chance to get some discussion going when it comes to politics, war and coups, it's probably not going to happen. Seems to be a very problematic movie. And the slow motion scene in the trailer was really silly. I'm almost already tired of this solely based on the trailer and premise. And that isn't a good sign. 




 Do you have some examples? Because I looked on their website and the cheapest Blu-ray titles from Criterion Collection were around $22.99 (exept for two that were $19.99 and $21.99). Some were also already on sale. If I go to Barnes   Noble and check out some of the same titles when they are having their sale, I'll still get a cheaper price. 




 I think this is the case of when they're trying to make a satire out of something, but only to become a part of it themselves, which doesn't really work well and becomes more of a problem. It's almost the same case with Showgirls (1995), I can appretiate what Verhoeven is trying to criticize, but the movie has a tendency to become a part of it itself. 




 A really cool and great Shinoda movie. It really looks splendid, very well shot. 




 I don't know what you were trying to say, because you just proved that you still save some bucks if you buy from the sale. Depending on where you live and the amount you are spending, there's free shipping available at Barnes   Noble too. Sure, Amazon sometimes have it as well, but it seems to be easier to get at Barnes   Noble. Also, Barnes   Noble can give members additional discounts plus coupons, which can get you even better prices. For example, I bought the Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman box set from the Barnes   Noble sale last year for very little money, I don't think you'll ever be able to find it on Amazon brand new for the price I got it for. The main thing is to always look and compare the prices, but of what I have seen, you rarely find better prices on these titles than from the Barnes   Noble sale, so your argument doesn't really hold. 




 Everyone else? Do you have some examples of where you can find titles from Criterion Collection at the same price as the 50% off sale that Barnes   Noble have? 




 Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. This is the opportunity if you want to get some titles from Criterion Collection cheap. I have some titles written down that I want, we'll see how much it gets. Poor wallet. 




 Uzak (2002) by Nuri Bilge Ceylan maybe? 




 I think one of them was sarcastic. Or maybe you are too? 




 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Solyaris (1972). 









 Well, it's good that people are addressing how African-Americans are portrayed in film, but it seemed rather strange to make a whole article about how the writer is done with the film. It's been around since 1939, so this isn't really any news. It would have been more relevant if it was a review or if she talked about how it is today and making similarites and/or differences to put it in context, or just something else to give it some more discussion value. 




  His    

A little correction, it was written by Kristen Page-Kirby, a woman. 




  But some of them are just in English and neither are set in America (thematically or geographically) nor have any involvement of America.     

And OP asked for the movies to be either American or in the English language:     


*"What are some of the best American/ English language movies created by foreign directors?"* 




 The releases by Criterion Collection usually have nice looking menus. I like the simplicity that many of them have.   
Here are some examples:

 I don't really care about height, but since you are asking, I'll have to go with Gunnar Bjrnstrand who was 6' 3". 




 I never really considered this before you asked, but Nema-ye Nazdik (1990), Nun va Goldoon (1996) and Ayneh (1997) are three movies that came up in my head. They all came out in the 90s, they are all Iranian movies, they are all filmed in Tehran, and most importantly, all of them are metafilms, which I think connects them in a special way. Also, it should be noted that it's three different directors behind them. 




 1. C'era una volta il West (1968) (Sergio Leone)     
2. Paris, Texas (1984) (Wim Wenders)       
3. Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966) (Sergio Leone)    
4. Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927) (F.W. Murnau)     
5. City Girl (1930) (F.W. Murnau)     
6. Possession (1981) (Andrzej Zulawski)        
7. Providence (1977) (Alain Resnais)     
8. Repulsion (1965) (Roman Polanski)    
9. The Holy Mountain (1973) (Alejandro Jodorowsky)     
10. Blowup (1966) (Michelangelo Antonioni)

 Modern Times (1936), that's how you do slapstick comedy. 




 I'm glad that people are talking about these things. While I don't fully agree with the writer about storytelling and characters and what every film needs, I can agree with him about a higher standard, that people should have that today. In a way, it does have to do much with taste of course.      

When I was looking at the list of the highest all-time worldwide box office films (about 600 films), I could probably count the ones that actually are good/decent (of those I have seen) on two hands, maybe even only one. I may be picky, but I think it says a lot when it comes to Hollywood and how big budgets doesn't at all equal great movies, at least for me. It's almost the opposite when it comes to my taste. The best movies I've ever seen are not even near that list.      

The one who wrote the Turn off Your Brain article actually said something very good:    

*"We should demand more from films. Instead of asking viewers to turn their brains off, how about we ask the people who make these things to turn their brains on?"* 




 Wake in Fright (1971). 




 It's not bad. Probably Malick's best one. Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek are great in it. 




 Alex Garland said in March earlier this year that a sequel would likely not happen in the near future. And when he said that he meant at least not with the crew that was involved in the film he directed.

Source: http://screencrush.com/dredd-2-not-happening/ 




 I would say that the best ones are these:        

* Eclipse Series 3: Late Ozu   
* Eclipse Series 11: Larisa Shepitko    
* Eclipse Series 13: Kenji Mizoguchis Fallen Women     
* Eclipse Series 19: Chantal Akerman in the Seventies      
* Eclipse Series 21: Oshimas Outlaw Sixties      
* Eclipse Series 39: Early Fassbinder      
* Eclipse Series 40: Late Ray      

In terms of the best films, I would easily choose The Ozu set. But it all depends on what you like and what you are into. 




 Oldeuboi (2003) is one of the most popular and loved Korean movies, so that's a recommendation. It's good. I don't know if you have seen it already, if not, that's a good and easy way to go next. It's also a part of a trilogy.            

Otherwise, check out [100 Korean Films](https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/100+korean+films) and [100 Korean Masterpieces by Film 2.0 (2008 Edition)](https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/100+korean+masterpieces+by+film+2.0+2008+edition/) which are two list that provide you with some essential and important Korean cinema, you'll find both newer and older films there. [Korean Movie Database](http://www.kmdb.or.kr/eng/) and [Korean Film Archive](http://www.koreafilm.org/) are two other useful sites that could come in handy too.      

Lately I've been into Hong Sang-soo, a great director from South Korea that makes good dramas. I can recommend Book chon bang hyang (2011), one of the best movies I've seen post-2000. 




 Great and beautifully shot film by Yoshida. 




 La plante sauvage (1973). 




 It's a great film. I like how simplistic it is in a way, but still big, beautiful and full of depth. Talk about a strong debut. A very interesting depiction on how rural life, poverty and dreams can be to human beings. Ray's direction is just lyrical and poetic, very pure and full of emotions. Ravi Shankar's music is amazing too. And when it comes to Ray in general, I have to say that he was a great director and very important for Indian cinema (and of course cinema in general). Jalsaghar (1958) is my favourite by him. I remember that it was the first Indian film I ever saw. It makes me happy that Criterion are releasing the Apu trilogy on Blu-ray and that we're going to see even more of his films restored. Speaking of Ray, I actually bought a little book about him written by Folke Isaksson and Stig T. Karlsson that I should start reading soon. 




 Pather Panchali (1955) is brilliant. 




 Aruitemo aruitemo (2008) is quite good, but I wouldn't say that it's as masterful as some of Ozu's best films. Koreeda's work doesn't really have the same framing and uncompromising form as many of Ozu's films have, even if we can see that he's a bit on his way in specifically Aruitemo aruitemo (2008) where the influences are very clear. Koreeda said himself that he feels that his own films are much closer to what Naruse did, and I would also agree a bit with that, especially with the bleaker worldview in social reality and a bit more sentimentality. The tranquil subtlety and unique stillness isn't really on par with Ozu for me. Some of Koreeda's work before Aruitemo aruitemo (2008) also had a more documentary feeling. And let's not forget that Ozu did comedies and gangster films in the beginning of his career. Anyways, the themes in Aruitemo aruitemo (2008) are of course very similar to the majority of films that Ozu made, that's easy to agree with. I'm just a bigger fan of Ozu than Koreeda, but I absolutely think Koreeda has done some good stuff. As I already said, Aruitemo aruitemo (2008) is good, although it's more of a homage that copies a lot from Ozu and Naruse than being something really, really unique. 




 It really seems to deserve it, the movie looks so absolutely terrible that it's sad. 




 I think it could help to read the novel of the same name by Thomas Pynchon. But if you want to do it before, after or not at all, that's up to you. I think the main thing is to not just try too hard understanding exactly everything. I feel that a lot of it is meant to be complicated and confusing to the viewer, just as it is for Sportello. In my opinion, I also think that it's more important to take in what you simply feel before understanding it all. There's probably several in-depth explanations online, which you could read afterwards too. Multiple viewings could help as well. 




 If short films count for you, then I believe Pool Sharks (1915) is the oldest one. 









 * Andrey Rublyov (1966)       
* Der siebente Kontinent (1989)     
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)        
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959)       
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)          
* L'eclisse (1962)      
* Nattvardsgsterna (1963)      
* Stntang (1994)     
* Suna no onna (1964)      
* Tanin no kao (1966)      




 I really liked Stntang (1994) much more than the novel. 




 The original release. In my opinion, the edited version has a jazzy soundtrack that doesn't go too well with the atmosphere of the movie. And the narration by Burroughs isn't at all necessary, the images speak better for themselves together with the already existing intertitles. Also, the edited version is heavily cut, which leaves out a lot. 




 I haven't seen that one, I just know that it wasn't really well-received, but it was clearly a financial success. And by the looks of this, I guess money is the big motivation. 




 Mon oncle (1958) by Jacques Tati. 




 It is! I would easily put on my top 10 list of both the best Swedish movies ever made and the best silents ever made. It has a great and dark atmosphere, an interesting narrative structure and top-notch use of double exposures. 




 Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes from Star Wars (1977). 




  You have never seen a trailer and thought "I will probly pass on that one"? 

Of course, I don't think anyone watches every single movie they've seen a trailer for. There's thousands of movies I mostly ignore. But that doesn't mean that I convinced myself to never watch it in my whole life. I just prefer to have an open mode to the whole thing. 




 To be honest, none. I'd rather see more original, innovative and interesting ideas and movies revolving around anything other than tons of so called cinematic universes where the studios pump them out one after another, on and on. Of course, I realize that these kind of things make money and that's what Hollywood are going after as well as the big general public, but it would be great to see a big change. I can't say that the majority of these big movies getting pumped out with their own cinematic universes hold any real quality either. I know this change isn't likely going to happen though, but that's my two cents. 




 I can't think of a single movie where I said to myself or anybody else that I'll never watch it. I don't see any real need for myself to set any specific boundaries when it comes to things like these. If I don't want to watch a movie, the reason is more likely because there's other movies I rather watch or because I'm just not that interested in it, which doesn't have to be a case of putting it on a list of movies I'll never watch. I try to be pretty open-minded when it comes to what I watch, but what I like is another thing. 




 Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence (1974), she's simply just amazing in that one. 




 The Limits of Control (2009). 




 There's a lot. I suggest that you look up some of the stuff Criterion Collection and Eureka (Masters of Cinema) have released, they usually have great transfers. And well, it also depends on what you mean with "older".         

Here's three examples of some older films that I own that look amazing:     

* L'eclisse (1962) (Criterion Collection)       
* Pickpocket (1959) (Criterion Collection)       
* Seppuku (1962) (Masters of Cinema)       

http://www.blu-ray.com/ is also a good source if you want to know a bit more about certain releases, they have a big amount of reviews where they for example talk about the video quality etc.     




 Based on the films you mentioned and liked, I would really recommend looking into these:     

* Ascenseur pour l'chafaud (1958)      
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959)  
* L'immortelle (1963)        
* L'amour  mort (1984)       
* La peau douce (1964)         
* Le mpris (1963)      
* Pickpocket (1959)     
* Ma nuit chez Maud (1969)    

Maybe you already know some of them because you mentioned films by Resnais, Malle and Truffaut already, I don't know how much you have watched so far, but they're all great. 





























 Quite misleading that the tags are "TOP ITALIAN MOVIES" and "ITALIAN MOVIES". Also, I don't know if movies like Eat Pray Love (2010) and Angels   Demons (2009) should be called classic movies at all. 




 Thumbs up. Great and beautiful film by Mizoguchi, one of his best ones. 




 I wouldn't say that I hate his movies, I mostly just dislike them. Of course, there are directors that are much, much worse. In my opinion, Nolan doesn't really know how to tell with pictures, which is his biggest problem. That's something I have stated before. He usually explains too much, especially using voice-over and/or dialogue, just to take an example. That makes his movies very empty. He doesn't seem to know how to be subtle. For me, to be overly clear about everything isn't something good, it doesn't leave much to the viewer. Therefore, his movies tend to be superficial as hell. I've never been a big fan of him. 




 Modern Times (1936), Safety Last! (1923), The General (1926), Duck Soup (1933), and Mon oncle (1958) are some examples. Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, the Marx brothers, and Tati are some names that were and still are very important to comedy films overall. 




 Some of my absolute favourite movies in that list. I love how he admired films by Teshigahara, Bergman, Mizoguchi, Antonioni and Bresson, some of my favourite directors as well as himself, heh. Tarkovsky had great taste! 




 Not that I care about the movie that much, but this poster looks much better than the original one, which is quite ugly:   
http://www.imdb.com/media/rm124909312/tt0478970 









 Don't you mean July? 




 I'm doing this myself, just not that super actively. Anyways, a random order is probably the easiest, because you get a little bit more diversity that way, and it's harder to get tired of the project overall. But it all depends on yourself. If a director doesn't have that many films in the collection, then it could be helpful and easier to watch those in a row, for example. Or if you want to have a certain director's films close to eacher to compare etc. I don't think there's a right or wrong answer.    

If you go to ICheckMovies, you can order the Criterion list by release year, runtime and a bit of other choices. That can maybe be helpful too:    

https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/the+criterion+collection/   


You have the official site and the Wikipedia page to help you as well:   

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Criterion_Collection_DVD_and_Blu-ray_releases


 




 You should! Actually, it's being released on Blu-ray by Criterion Collection in about a week.

Here's a review that came up some weeks ago:  

http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Hiroshima-mon-amour-Blu-ray/103958/    

The restoration/transfer looks amazing. It scored a full 5.0 rating on video, audio and even the extras. The Criterion sale Barnes   Noble are having is starting any day soon, which means 50% on everything from the collection, I am so buying this! If you want to get your hands on it, this is a great opportunity, just a tip! 




 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) would be a great choice to start with. 




 As I said, it was a while ago I read it, so I can't say that I remember too much of it. I remember that I didn't have any problem with it at least. If I recall it correctly, I think I liked the beginning of the book the most, before Red and the others actually went into the zone. I'm guessing you read it in English (considering your link)? I read it translated in Swedish, so maybe our experiences weren't totally the same because of that too. 




 Indeed. I read it a couple of years ago, great stuff. 




 Nothing going on that's been established, but check out his page on IMDb:   
http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0027572/    

If there's any news, they will probably be to the right, the "Related News" column. 




 16 movies I haven't seen from that list. Otherwise, it's quite a mainstream list with a big focus on films from the Anglosphere and Hollywood. I wouldn't even consider having a big chunk of those movies near my own top 300, but each to their own. 




  Is there a site out there that rates image quality of blu ray releases?

http://www.blu-ray.com/ does that. http://www.dvdbeaver.com/ can help you with their Blu-ray reviews as well. 




 Yeah, I like all those three more as well. Double Indemnity (1955) is my favourite by him. One of the best film noir flicks! The Lost Weekend (1945), Stalag 17 (1953) and Ace in the Hole (1951) are some other Wilder films I think are better than Some Like It Hot (1959) too. 




  I did, however, notice that sometimes the definition can be distracting when watching older movies (70's-80's).   

Can you elaborate what you mean? It always depends on the transfer, some can be worse than others. But for me, I have never had an exception where I wanted to watch the DVD of a film instead of the Blu-ray (if I have access to both of them and in terms of quality), not yet at least. 




 Or maybe she just has a different taste than you? A movie isn't automatically and objectively good just because it has a high IMDb rating. Taste is subjective. Of course, it's a bit of a far stretch to call everyone who rates movies on IMDb and RT idiots, because that would include people that dislike certain movies as much as she does, so that should probably be taken with a pinch of salt.    


 but she actively dislikes really good ones.    

That sounds strange, I think it's just that she probably dislikes some of the movies you think are good, which isn't the same thing. Everyone doesn't like every movie you like, that's just the way the world is. Deal with it. 




 Good for you! 




 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_cinema 




 Great director! Which of his movies have you seen so far? Criterion Collection's release of the Apu trilogy is probably going to be neat! 




 You can't go wrong with some Ozu and Fassbinder!

 The classic monster list! I should maybe take care of that one soon, I still got 21 entries in it left to see. 




 A great list overall. The only movie on the list which I didn't like that much was Some Like It Hot (1959) that I rated 2/5, all the other ones are 3/5, 4/5 and some 5/5 in my book. Maybe I should rewatch the Wilder film, I would maybe like it more now, I like some of his other movies nonetheless. 




 A pity! No, I haven't seen them, but I want to do it! 




 Well, I want to see Eisenstein in Guanajuato (2015), I was just sticking to the five I look forward to the most. Jia Zhangke's new film could be interesting to see too, but I had to admit that I wasn't really a big fan of the three films I've seen by him so far. On the other hand, I'll still watch some of his other movies anyways, maybe I'll find someone I like a bit more than the others. 




 I had a nice movie weekend myself. Watched fifteen movies, which will do for now. It's Monday and 4:19 in the morning here, so I'm going to bed now. Oh, and the best ones were Ghare-Baire (1984) by Satyajit Ray, Tsuma wa kokuhaku suru (1961) by Yasuz Masumura and Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sospetto (1970) by Elio Petri. Great stuff. Now I got [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OyP2fQRSzI) song stuck in my head, all because of the Petri movie and Morricone. 




 Does it? Do you know something I don't? The last thing I heard was that he was going to make a whole new movie after he cancelled the film that was going to be called Flashmob, but I haven't heard any more details, just that it will be shot in France. 




 For the first time? 




 I think it was L'eclisse (1962) by Michelangelo Antonioni. 




 There's a chance for that, sure. 




 Or even better, a 49 minute scene where he meets Woody Allen and they go for lunch to discuss Ingmar Bergman's movies. 




 Nattvardsgsterna (1963) and Smultronstllet (1957) by Ingmar Bergman. 




 I'm mostly excited about these:   


* Ji-geum-eun-mat-go-geu-ddae-neun-teul-li-da (2015) *(Hong Sang-soo)*    
* Le Louvre sous l'Occupation (2015) *(Aleksandr Sokurov)*   
* Rak ti Khon Kaen (2015) *(Apichatpong Weerasethakul)*    
* Taxi (2015) *(Jafar Panahi)*   
* Umimachi Diary (2015) *(Hirokazu Koreeda)*   

I'm hoping that Abbas Kiarostami, Lav Diaz and Michael Haneke are giving us with new movies as well. I know at least that Haneke and Kiarostami are both working on something new, but those will probably not be released this year. We'll see. 




 * A Clockwork Orange (1971)   
* Hud (1963)
* Taxi Driver (1976)   
* The Hustler (1961)     




 Le trou (1960), the suspense nearly killed me the first time I watched it! A true masterpiece and the best prison film ever made! 




 Oh, there's probably hundreds of movies I own that I haven't watched yet. I try to buy movies as often I can, so I usually always own something I haven't watched. I watch movies via streaming and movies that aren't my own as well for example, so that's also another reason that there's always unwatched films in my own personal collection. I always have movies to watch, whether it's in my own collection, via streaming or any other way, so there's a lot left to see for me. Too little time, too many films! I just don't have the time and possibility to watch exactly everything at once. I recently bought San taam (2007) and Tky sonata (2008) for instance (both were Eureka releases (Masters of Cinema) and on dual format), which I haven't watched at all, but I just got both a couple of days ago. So it's all a matter of time and what to prioritize. 




 Exactly, same here. But does your partner hate them even if the movie is in a language your partner isn't fluent in? 




 Woody Allen. 




 Robert Bresson is a great example. He started with a slapstick comedy, then doing a bit more regular/classic dramas, and after that, he evolved his style with his own set of "rules" of uncompromising minimalism where he totally abandoned classic filmmaking and did movies the way no one ever did before, just to come as far away from the theatre as possible, which he felt didn't belong in film. 




 You really do that? I have never heard about anyone who does this, seems like a strange way to watch a film if it's in a language you don't know for example, especially if it's a film with much dialogue. Does it work well for you? 




 I always use them if they're available, even when a movie is in a language I already know. It's easy to miss something, dialogue volume can be low sometimes etc. And when it comes to watching movies in languages you don't know, it's quite mandatory and essential to have subtitles if you don't want to make it harder for yourself. And there's no one that knows every single language in the world either. 




 If you ask me, it's a movie that actually has something to say, about film, consumtion and our society as well. People are of course free to call it off as "pointless garbage", but I think there's a lot of people that don't understand it at all, which is a bit sad. I'm not judging everybody who didn't like it, only stating that I've seen viewers who completely misunderstood it or didn't get it and labeled it as bad because of that. Also, you have to have seen a fair share of cinema to get all the intertextuality, there's a certain reference to one of Tarkovsky's movies in the ending, just to take an example of something that actually is connected to the movie. 




 I have no idea what you have seen, so I'll chip in with all my favourite films:    


* Der siebente Kontinent (1989) *(Michael Haneke)*     
* Andrey Rublyov (1966) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*    
* L'eclisse (1962) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*    
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) *(Chantal Akerman)*     
* Tanin no kao (1966) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*     
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)*    
* Suna no onna (1964) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*    
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959) *(Alain Resnais)*   
* Nattvardsgsterna (1963) *(Ingmar Bergman)*    
* Stntang (1994) *(Bla Tarr)*    
* Krhozat (1988) *(Bla Tarr)*    
* Le trou (1960) *(Jacques Becker)*   
* C'era una volta il West (1968) *(Sergio Leone)*     
* Sanma no aji (1962) *(Yasujir Ozu)*   
* Smultronstllet (1957) *(Ingmar Bergman)*    
* Pickpocket (1959) *(Robert Bresson)*    
* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) *(Rainer Werner Fassbinder)*    
* Tystnaden (1963) *(Ingmar Bergman)*   
* La notte (1961) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*      
* Zerkalo (1975) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*    
* Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956) *(Robert Bresson)*   
* Stalker (1979) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*   
* Solyaris (1972) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*   
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969) *(Juraj Herz)*   
* Jalsaghar (1958) *(Satyajit Ray)*   
* Banshun (1949) *(Yasujir Ozu)*   

It would be nice to know if you haven't seen any of them already. If there's some you've missed, it would be really interesting to hear those you will be watching and the verdict later on! 




 I would say that it's certainly not your second choice. Basically, it's a message about violence in the media, Haneke himself wrote an essay about his thoughts concerning this, it can be found in the book A Companion to Michael Haneke. I would suggest to look it up if you are interested in his views and if you want to clear some light about the movie as well. 




 I would recommend that you look up some of the stuff Criterion Collection and Eureka (Masters of Cinema) have released, they both usually have great transfers and often release important and great films together with interesting bonus features.

Here's three movies I would really advice to pick up which are great and look stunning on Blu-ray:    

* L'eclisse (1962) (Criterion Collection)    
* Pickpocket (1959) (Criterion Collection)    
* Seppuku (1962) (Masters of Cinema)    

http://www.blu-ray.com/ is also a good source if you want to know a bit more about certain releases, they have many reviews where they for example go a little more in-depth about the video quality etc. 




 I really disliked Chappie (2015) (which I talked about why in several other threads) and thought that Ex Machina (2015) was mediocre, but I think you shouldn't rely on what movies you should watch based on the majority of Reddit. This isn't a site where you will find the universal truth about which movies are good and bad, because there's no such thing. And you really shouldn't expect Reddit to know exactly what you would like, that's just foolish. Nothing here has anything to do with right or wrong as well, rather different opinions. I didn't recommend Ex Machina (2015), so I guess the rest of Reddit can take care of your "fuck you". 




 http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/directors/  

I would say that list is the one to go with if you want something already established, it's a great starting point. It's a list with a lot of great movies that are good to have seen and to know about if you're just getting interested in cinema, as well as essential and important ones. It also gets you introduced to films from several different countries and decades. 




 Hiroshima mon amour (1959), directed by Alain Resnais and with a script by Marguerite Duras, has one of the best voice-overs in my opinion. What I like about it is that Resnais didn't just use voice-over narration for the sake of the pictures, but to asks questions, make points and describe memories for example. Of course, anyone can do that, but I don't think any movie can tackle it the same way as Hiroshima mon amour (1959) did.     


There's also not only one voice-over, but two, because there's two central characters to be concerned about. I just love how the editing and the images work together with the two voice-overs and form the narrative together with its central themes of time, space, memories and subjectivity to add more complexity to the exploration of the problems with our existance, especially communication and the impossibility to fully know a human being. Also, while doing this, we travel back and forth to both the present and the past. Even the beginning of the movie starts with the two characters talking through a voice-over narration where one of them claims one thing and the other one the total opposite, because it's a film that has to do with opposites and contradictions.    

I can go on talking, but I won't spoil too much of everything for those who haven't seen it, this movie is mandatory to see if you're interested in cinema. It's a very poetic, complex and beautiful masterpiece that has a very special use of voice-over narration.     

On another one, I think Robert Bresson's use of voice-over should be mentioned too, especially in his later movies. We had a thread about him some weeks ago, so I won't go in-depth about him once again, but as he was a perfectionist and a minimalist, his use of voice-over was as well very special and precise, everything was well calculated and he was quite determined when it came to strip down everything to its bare essentials. His book explains a bit about his own "rules" and what he thought about the relation between sounds and images, very interesting if you haven't read it. 




 Stalker (1979) and Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969). 




 Have you searched?     

Whole Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/search?q=Seeking+a+Friend+for+the+End+of+the+World   

This subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/search?q=Seeking+a+Friend+for+the+End+of+the+World restrict_sr=on       

I would say that 202 user reviews on IMDb it's a lot if we are talking about movies that should deserve more attention. I think it's a bit unfair to the ones that really deserve it. Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (2012) is a typical movie that I didn't even have to actively seek out to find about, I saw it advertised on YouTube, IMDb and similar big sites without putting any effort to it. I think if one is going to pick a movie that truly deserves more attention, it should actually be one that most people haven't heard of, that's faded in obscurity, quite forgotten, rarely mentioned and not talked about a lot, a movie where you actually have to be a bit active to find out. Of course, you can find stuff by sheer luck, but I hope you get my point.     

But maybe it has to do with how much you are into movies. A big majority here in this subreddit label movies like Moon (2009) and Sunshine (2007) as not so well known, which I think says quite much.    




 Really? There's been several threads about this movie here, and people have been talking about it in other threads as well. There's over 150 critics that reviewed it on Rotten Tomatoes and 129 pages with reviews by the audience on the same site. There's also over 202 user reviews for it on IMDb and I see people mentioning it on a lot of other various sites. That's just some examples, it feels like it has gotten its share of attention, because there's a lot other movies that don't even get a third of that much awareness. That's why I think it's a bit strange to mention a movie like that. Maybe you just missed all the talk.    


Anyways, if I have to pick one movie, I would say Tobenai chinmoku (1966) by Kazuo Kuroki. It seems that I'm the only one that has mentioned it here on Reddit, I couldn't find anything if I searched for it, not even by the English title. A quite forgotten gem, only 159 users have rated in on IMDb for example. I would easily consider it one of the best Japanese movies ever made, it really deserves to be talked about more. There's not even a proper DVD/Blu-ray release of it yet, which I hope will change in the future.  




 All of them are great and some I would consider the best films ever made. Criterion Collection has released all of them on DVD and three of them on Blu-ray. Some other studios have released them on DVD and Blu-ray as well, you can find more information on http://www.blu-ray.com/ regarding the Blu-ray versions. Three of them are also available to stream on Hulu. 




 It can be a glitch, or maybe it's not just updated yet. It's a very new movie, so there's probably many more reviews coming in a couple of days. 




 Five of my favourites when it comes to such films:    

* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) *(Rainer Werner Fassbinder)*    
Takes place entirely in the house of the main character.    

* L'anne dernire  Marienbad (1961) *(Alain Resnais)*   
Takes place in a chateau.    

* Le trou (1960) *(Jacques Becker)*   
Takes pretty much place a prison only.    

* Suna no onna (1964) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*   
Takes place by the seaside in the desert, almost entirely in a sandhole.   

* Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956) *(Robert Bresson)*   
Takes place in a prison.     




 Yeah, but that's only 5 reviews. 




 Here's fifteen recommendations you just have to watch:    

* A Woman Under the Influence (1974) *(John Cassavetes)*   
* Akai satsui (1964) *(Shhei Imamura)*          
* Angst vor der Angst (1975) *(Rainer Werner Fassbinder)*          
* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) *(Rainer Werner Fassbinder)*    
* Il deserto rosso (1964) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)* 
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) *(Chantal Akerman)*       
* Jen (1967) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)*    
* Mouchette (1967) *(Robert Bresson)*   
* Mulholland Dr.	(2001) *(David Lynch)*       
* Opening Night (1977) *(John Cassavetes)*       
* Persona (1966) *(Ingmar Bergman)*         
* Possession (1981) *(Andrzej Zulawski)*      
* Repulsion (1965) *(Roman Polanski)*   
* Tsuma wa kokuhaku suru (1961) *(Yasuz Masumura)*           
* Tystnaden (1963) *(Ingmar Bergman)*   

These are what I would consider some of the best tragic and dark female character studies ever made. 




 If you start chronologically, you begin with Sono otoko, kyb ni tsuki (1989), which will work quite well as a starting point, it's a movie more oriented in action and police stuff. Or if you want to start with something more of a drama/comedy, go with Kikujir no natsu (1999), it's one of his most loved movies and it's quite easy to like as well as accessible. 




 Best:    

* Andrey Rublyov (1966) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*       
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) *(Chantal Akerman)*        
* L'eclisse (1962) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*    
* Suna no onna (1964) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*         
* Tanin no kao (1966) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*        

Worst:     

* A Room with a View (1985) *(James Ivory)*    
* Armageddon (1998) *(Michael Bay)*   
* Lat sau san taam (1992) *(John Woo)*     
* The Chronicle History of King Henry the Fift with His Battell Fought at Agincourt in France (1944) *(Laurence Olivier)*    
* The Rock (1996) *(Michael Bay)*    




 Nobi (1959) by Kon Ichikawa. 




 Huh? 




 * Den-en ni shisu (1974) *(Shji Terayama)*     
* Les quatre cents coups (1959) *(Franois Truffaut)*     




 They don't have connected plots, so it doesn't matter. But make sure to watch all of them, it's some good stuff. 




 Here's two recommendations:       

* Ich mchte kein Mann sein (1918) *(Ernst Lubitsch)*    

It's about Ossi, she's revolting against her parents because they want her to be like a proper young lady, instead she goes to buy men's clothes and starts acting like a man. A little gem that's quite entertaining and charming.    


* Berg-Ejvind och hans hustru (1918) *(Victor Sjstrm)*   

In my opinon, Sjstrm was easily the best of the Swedish directors from the silent era. This one is about Berg-Ejvind that is running away from justice. He comes to work at widow Halla's farm and they fall in love. But when the truth about him is revealed, he and Halla decide to flee to the mountains. Sjstrm really proves that he was great at capturing nature in this movie. Not my favourite by him, but really worth watching. 




 Great film, one the best ones from the last fifteen years. I should rewatch it soon. 




 Suna no onna (1964) by Hiroshi Teshigahara. 




 Welt am Draht (1973) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder could count. Solyaris (1972) by Andrei Tarkovsky is another one mixing science fiction and mystery. None of them have that much to do with detectives, even though Welt am Draht (1973) has a detective in it, but I'm guessing you were after either detective stories or mysteries? 




 Well, maybe the "fault" is rather within yourself than me. You can always use Google to look up the movies you don't recognize. I even wrote the names of the directors. If I don't recognize something myself, I just look it up instead of trying to make a fuzz about it, attacking someone or anything similar. There is nothing that hinders you from anything at all. We are on the Internet, information is easy to find.    


 If you want to post on a Japanese site to talk about a Japanese film, would you use the French or English title?     

As I already said, I always use the original titles.    




 Oh, there's so much great Japanese cinema. I've picked out 40 of my absolute favourites when it comes to Japanese films for you:

I hope you'll find something you like. With this list, you'll also get introduced to some of the great and important directors from Japan as well. 




  It's pretentious as fuck.    

No, it's not. It's rather pretentious to put so much focus on it as you seem to do.   

I have explained this a lot of times before, but I guess I have to do it again. I always use the original titles when writing, because that's my standard and those are the original titles that the directors wanted to have in the first place. Every single movie doesn't have alternate or English titles either, and I don't want to be mixing everything around for the sake of that.         

For example, Le Havre (2011) and Play (2011) don't have English language titles, but titles in some other languages. I am also of the opinion that many English language titles are quite bad.   


And for you, it seems that you are more interesting in making a fuzz about things than actually discussing and/or talking about the movies themselves. I'm not breaking against any rules and can't see the problem. If you are interested in the English language titles, you are free to look them up for yourself. 




  Not at all. I love movies and am very impressed.    

So you believe me now? Hah.        

 Like, how many movies came out in 1893?      

http://www.imdb.com/year/1893/    

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1893_in_film   

Both IMDb and Wikipedia only have two movies each listed from that year. But this was at a very early stage of the history of film, which probably says quite much about it.    

 You must have a wealth of historical knowledge if you've seen that diversity of movies.    

Well, I guess so! I think it's great to have so many references to work with if you go through the history of film by each year in a similar way. It also helps you a lot when watching movies overall. I try to pick up as much as I can about cinema. If one has some kind of interest in films, I think it's important to try and watch different kind of films as much as you can, from every decade and from all countries you can find movies from. Even if you don't like everything, it makes your own experiences and references only richer. As I said before, I didn't entirely know if I actually had missed a year before I looked at it a little closer.     

 May l ask what decade of your life you're in?     

I was born in 1988, if that's what you are wondering about. I'll be turning 27 this year.      




 They even missed one of the best ones, Je t'aime, je t'aime (1968) by Alain Resnais. 




  1966 - I have practically no interest in westerns and 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' seems to be the only notable film that came out that year.     


You should see it though. I know many people who weren't at all into the Western genre, but absolutely loved that movie. It's quite universal and easy to like. A real classic. Leone's Western movies were quite different from American Western movies, like those by Howard Hawks, John Ford etc.       

And the only notable film? Oh, I would disagree on that. Two of my all-time favourites came out that year, Andrey Rublyov (1966) by Andrei Tarkovsky and Tanin no kao (1966) by Hiroshi Teshigahara. Both are masterpieces. The first one being Tarkovsky's massive epic about the great fifteenth-century Russian iconographer, but also a movie about a dark time in the history of Russia. The other one is an amazing and complex exploration about identity that is partly science fiction.           


Here'e eight other notable films from the year that are very good:     


* Au hasard Balthazar (1966) *(Robert Bresson)*       
* Blowup (1966) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*    
* Dai-bosatsu tge (1966) *(Kihachi Okamoto)*    
* La battaglia di Algeri (1966) *(Gillo Pontecorvo)*    
* Onna no naka ni iru tanin (1966) *(Mikio Naruse)*      
* Persona (1966) *(Ingmar Bergman)*    
* Taiji ga mitsury suru toki (1966) *(Kji Wakamatsu)*       
* Tobenai chinmoku (1966) *(Kazuo Kuroki)*    

A film like Persona (1966) is of course totally essential if you have the least interest in cinema. And for example, I feel like a movie such as Tobenai chinmoku (1966) is extremely forgotten and/or overlooked. It deserves more attention, I would rank it as one of the best Japanese movies of all time. 




 Here's my ten favourites from the 1980s:       

1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989) *(Michael Haneke)*    
2. Krhozat (1988) *(Bla Tarr)*     
3. A Zed   Two Noughts (1985) *(Peter Greenaway)*        
4. Paris, Texas (1984) *(Wim Wenders)*       
5. Shoah (1985) *(Claude Lanzmann)*    
6. Blue Velvet (1986) *(David Lynch)*     
7. Tsuit no zawameki (1988) *(Yoshihiko Matsui)*      
8. Down by Law (1986) *(Jim Jarmusch)*       
9. Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986) *(Konstantin Lopushanskiy)*     
10. Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987) *(Wim Wenders)*     




  Now I guess the question is, what should I watch from 1917?    

Umirayushchii lebed (1917) by Yevgeni Bauer! The English title is The Dying Swan. I think he's a director from the silent days that really needs more recognition. If I remember correctly, the movie is also available on YouTube. A very beautiful little melodrama with a great dance sequence and a captivating story. Bauer also had some interesting techniques when it came to tinting and double exposures. Do not miss this! Probably my favourite film of the ones before the 1920s.    

Also, two honorable mentions are Tsen frn Stormyrtorpet (1917) and Terje Vigen (1917), both directed by Victor Sjstrm. 




  The topic clearly doesn't concern you.    

I didn't know that from the start. That's why I went through all the films I had seen, because I wanted to see if there was a year that I missed. I'm sorry if I made you upset or anything. It felt bad to not answer after all the hard work of looking up all the statistics of the films I have watched.         

I was actually expecting a lot more users that had watched something from every year, I'm quite surprised over how many here actually have some years missed. I'm not saying that in a bad way, because there's a lot of great suggestions in the thread, and hopefully someone will discover something nice. 




 First of all, no. I watch films from all over the world. Of all the films I have seen, English language films are even the ones dominating the list.    

I never acted like anything is superior to anything. I just made a list without the movies OP mentioned. That the ones I liked the most happen to be in Hungarian, Korean, Swedish or French, that's totally irrelevant. It's not the same thing as ignoring something. It's you yourself that's putting all the focus on the language, not me. I care about the film, not the language. Also, English is not my main language, so what's foreign to you might not be that foreign for me. Sorry if I ruined your conception of the world or anything, but when you talk like the way you do, it seems that you are acting as if English language films would be superior, so I don't really know what you want to get out of this discussion. Maybe you want me to change my taste all for you? I that case, I'm not doing it, I'm just being honest. Too bad people mistake honesty for something else. 




 Well, too bad for you. I don't get why it would be hard to believe. I don't really know what you wanted to say with your comment either. Do you want me to prove it to you somehow? Or are you just trying to make fun? Do you want me to excuse myself because I like watching movies? If you knew me, then you probably wouldn't write anything like that. But I guess it's easy having your own ideas about people you don't know on the Internet. 




 Stntang (1994). 




  Most cynical: Funny Games    

Haneke actually said something interesting regarding movies and cynicism that I agree with:     

*"Films that are entertainments give simple answers but I think that's ultimately more cynical, as it denies the viewer room to think. If there are more answers at the end, then surely it is a richer experience."* 




 Sorry if I dissapoint you, but after looking at the list of the films I have watched, I seem to have seen films from every single year in the history of cinema. There doesn't seem to be any available films made earlier than 1887 according to IMDb and Wikipedia, so that's what I came down to. Now I can't answer your question of what I want to see the most either, hah. 




 My choice would be Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) by Lav Diaz. 




  1) Do you agree with these 10 movies being selected as the best of the decade so far?        

I agree about The Act of Killing (2012). The rest? Not at all. I should add that I haven't seen Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) yet, but if I know myself good enough, I don't think it will make it on my list either.

 2) If you could do a top 10 list not counting these movies, what would it be?      

I think it would look like this together with my ratings if I remove The Act of Killing (2012):    

1. Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) *(Lav Diaz)* 4/5        
2. A torini l (2011) *(Bla Tarr)* 4/5           
3. Book chon bang hyang (2011) *(Hong Sang-soo)* 4/5          
4. Amour (2012) *(Michael Haneke)* 4/5          
5. Da-reun na-ra-e-suh (2012) *(Hong Sang-soo)* 4/5           
6. Le Havre (2011) *(Aki Kaurismki)* 4/5             
7. Dupa dealuri (2012) *(Cristian Mungiu)* 4/5          
8. Jodaeiye Nader az Simin (2011) *(Asghar Farhadi)* 4/5          
9. Loong Boonmee raleuk chat (2010) *(Apichatpong Weerasethakul)* 3/5           
10. Play (2011) *(Ruben stlund)* 3/5         




 Some suggestions:    

* Clo de 5  7 (1962) (Paris, France)      
* Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987) (Berlin, Germany or West Germany if you will)      
* Do the Right Thing (1989) (Brooklyn, New York, USA)       
* L'immortelle (1963) (Istanbul, Turkey)              
* Manhattan (1979) (Manhattan, New York, USA)             
* Mystery Train (1989) (Memphis, USA)               
* Onna ga kaidan wo agaru toki (1960) (Tokyo, Japan)     
* Shinjuku dorob nikki (1969) (Tokyo, Japan)   
* Stroszek (1977) (Wisconsin, USA)             
* Tsuit no zawameki (1988) (Osaka, Japan)          









 Suna no onna (1964) by Hiroshi Teshigahara. I think the movie captured the core of the novel by Kb Abe perfectly, especially the absurdity and meaninglessness of our existance and the overall feel the book had and all the situations. Abe also collaborated with Teshigahara. The music by Takemitsu was amazing as well. 




 There's only 11 films from India in the collection if you look it up on the website, so it isn't that many. And three of them belong to the Eclipse Series 40: Late Ray. A direct link when using the search function:   

http://www.criterion.com/library/expanded_view?c=India p=1      

Anyways, I would recommend Jalsaghar (1958) by Satyajit Ray, that's my favourite film by him. A masterpiece. Beautiful and tender cinematography, interesting portrayal of the main character and wonderful music. Charulata (1964) and Mahanagar (1963) by Ray are great as well. I can add that the Eclipse box set that includes the Ray films is worth looking into too. All three of the films in that box are good, especially Ghare-Baire (1984).     

I haven't seen the films by Ismail Merchant, Zafar Hai and James Ivory that are out of print, but these aren't maybe one hundred percent Indian because of the collaboration with UK and USA. Then there's Monsoon Wedding (2001) by Mira Nair, but I haven't seen that one either. I actually missed it when it aired on TV some weeks ago. 




 It looks like Samuel isn't going to take it anymore. 




 Well, there's subtitles (at least in English) available for all of them, sure. 




 Not a single one? Wow, then I'll say you have some great flicks to discover!

 Andrzej Zulawski probably. And hopefully. It was fifteen years ago his last movie came out, now he's back to filmmaking again. His new movie Cosmos (2015) seems to be completed too, so I'm looking forward to that. I really like Possession (1981) that he directed, great one. 




 Not really surprising, it seems quite bad. 




 I think it was when I just stumbled upon L'eclisse (1962) by Michelangelo Antonioni on a film site. By that time, I had not seen so many older movies. And I decided to give it a go. I just loved it. It had a whole different film language than I was used to. Afterwards, I looked up the other two Antonioni films in his alienation trilogy and saw those two as well. I also started to read more about film in general, about different directors, film history, cinematography etc. I guess it was that particular film that hooked me. I remember that Robert Bresson also was a big part of it. I started to read film essays, looking up important and essential films and so on. Slowly, all of this changed the way I looked at cinema overall and I started absorbing all the information I could get my hands on. 




 M (1931) is a German movie. And if you want to be fair, The Third Man (1949) is a British flick. But M (1931) is the only movie in the list that isn't an English language movie.

 I haven't actually seen that one yet, I only know of it. I have to go through the Truffaut films I have left soon. It was quite long ago I actually saw one of his movies. 




 * Cra cuervos (1976) (Carlos Saura)    
* Den-en ni shisu (1974) (Shji Terayama)     
* Dong dong de jia qi (1984) (Hou Hsiao-hsien)    
* Ivanovo detstvo (1962) (Andrei Tarkovsky)     
* Khane-ye doust kodjast? (1987) (Abbas Kiarostami)    
* Les quatre cents coups (1959) (Franois Truffaut)     
* Pather Panchali (1955) (Satyajit Ray)    
* The Go-Between (1970) (Joseph Losey)   


I picked out eight of my favourites around the whole concept of childhood. I also tried to get it quite diverse. Saura deals with a child fascinated by death as well as a story that uses Franco's dictatorship to give it even more depth. Terayama's film is quite psychedelic and about a very unhappy childhood. Hsiao-hsien's Taiwanese picture explores relations in the family, meanings and responsibilities when it comes to grownups through the eyes of children. Tarkovsky's war film focuses on how a child can experience war and the dreams that come up in that situation. Kiarostami's movie is about expectations that come from the adult world and a little bit of the friendship of children. When it comes to Truffaut, you already mentioned it yourself. I just put it in my list because it's still one of my favourites and one of the most important ones, a great flick about what can happen to a boy who is left without attention from his own parents. Then you have Ray's beautiful and poetic movie about poverty and how it is to grow up with dreams in rural India. And finally, Losey's period drama that deals with a young boy stuck between two different adults and how it affects him. 




 * 8 (1963)      
* Le mpris (1963)     
* Nun va Goldoon (1996)       




 Many ideas can be good. And this particular one can be interesting. But it all comes down to how you execute the idea and what you want to say with it, that's the important part. I think that's the aspect one should put first. I haven't seen the movie, so I can't say anything about that, just that the execution is the most important thing, not only the bare essentials of the idea. If you are wondering whether or not it's a good idea to put in motion in real life, I would say no. It would probably cause more damage than anything good. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989) by Michael Haneke. But one should also know that the list is for example a bit corrupted concerning the votes. Some people use only 1 and 10, people form groups to vote up/against certain movies, many vote up newer movies like crazy, certain users rate movies they haven't even seen, every Tom, Dick and Harry can make an account and start voting etc. And it's based pretty much on popularity too. So it should always be taken with a big pinch of salt, I just like to point that out. 




 Indeed. I didn't plan on getting the Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman box set some months ago, but I just couldn't hold myself because of the price it had during the last sale. 




 The best ones in your list:       

 Tokyo Story, La Jetee/Sans Soleil, A Woman Under the Influence, Taste of Cherry, Ballad of Narayama, Ali: Fear Eats the Soul, My Winnipeg        

Good/worth picking up:         

 Black Narcissus, Gomorrah, Good Morning, The Great Dictator, La Haine, Harlan County, USA, The Killing, Lonesome, Love Streams, The Red Shoes, Rosetta, Safety Last!, The Gold Rush, 12 Angry Men, Make Way for Tomorrow, The Thin Red Line, Yi Yi    

Not my taste, but still worth seeing:     
 La Cienega    

When it comes to The Complete Jacques Tati, this is probably one of the better chances when it comes to box sets, you'll get it fairly cheap. I'm not a die hard fan of Tati, but if you like him, it's a good opportunity to invest in the box. I haven't seen the ones I left out, so I can't say much about them.  









 Repulsion (1965) by Roman Polanski. 




 I think those people that talk about those things mostly aren't that interested in cinema overall and/or look at movies with a single-sided approach. Of course, actors and such is one thing, but caring that much about awards and box office is quite irrelevant. For me, I never care about how much money a film made, that makes no difference for me, that's probably the last thing I care about. If you ask me, I can't even point out a single correct answer on how much money certain movies actually made, that's just not interesting for me. If a film by a director you like was a financial disaster, it probably can ruin the director to the point that the person can't do any more movies, but that's another thing knowing about than for example putting too much focus on the exact numbers.     

Also, I have a hard time taking the Academy Awards too seriously, it's just some popular and superficial circlejerking that doesn't actually put the important things about cinema as an artform in the spotlight. The circlejerking Academy Awards people seem to care more about clothes and looks. On the other hand, I've never cared too much about awards in general. Anyways, I have to agree with you, too many seem to care about what you are mentioning, which is a bit sad.     




 I think you should look into films made by actual Arabs, that way you won't find the portrayal as typical Western as many Western movies tend to be. I'm not saying that all movies that aren't done by Arabs have that certain portrayal, just that you get another picture of the whole thing if it's films made by non-Western directors.      

DIFF made an interesting list that could be good to look into:    
https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/diffs+the+100+greatest+arab+films/    




 L'eclisse (1962) has one of my favourite endings. But I think you have to see the whole movie to get the context of it, which probably is the same with many other great endings. 









 Jason Friedberg, Aaron Seltzer, Brian Levant, and Dennis Dugan. 




 You probably mean Marmoulak (2004) by Kamal Tabrizi? 




 Wu wu mian (2015) by Tsai Ming-liang. 




 Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence (1974), she's simply amazing in that movie. 




 Why do you think that? It would rather be strange otherwise. I think it's just maybe you that didn't like some of the movies. I didn't like Chappie (2015) either, but you also have to remember that this list is made by several persons, which probably explains why it's so diverse. 




 You also have Je t'aime je t'aime (1968) by Alain Resnais. A good one. 




 Some good ones. Here's three of my favourites from Iran I would like to recommend:       

* Nema-ye Nazdik (1990) (Abbas Kiarostami)       
* Nun va Goldoon (1996) (Mohsen Makhmalbaf)      
* Tabiate bijan (1974) (Sohrab Shahid Saless)    
























 Apocalypse Now (1979) and Fitzcarraldo (1982) are two movies that had quite troubled productions, but they turned out great in the end. 




 Check out the posters at https://www.polishposter.com and see if you can find any cool ones, maybe from some movies you yourself like. A lot of great stuff there. 




 From Wikipedia:   


*"On September 5, 2014, Paramount announced that Terminator Genisys would be the first film in a new stand-alone trilogy, with two sequels scheduled for release on May 19, 2017 and June 29, 2018. On February 24, 2015, Schwarzenegger confirmed that he will return for the first sequel."*    

If you use Google, you'll find some more information.

 I think the majority of people hanging out in this subreddit have already seen it. 




 Here you go: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_on_screen 




 This is embarrassing. I don't know if I should feel sorry for the one who wrote that, but someone needs to do their homework. 




 Have you seen The Sword of Doom (1966) and Three Outlaw Samurai (1964)? Two other great Japanese samurai films. 




 TSPDT is the definitive answer: http://www.theyshootpictures.com/ 




 Well, you are kind of asking about two different things here. For me, I think it was L'eclisse (1962) by Michelangelo Antonioni that made me appreciate cinema on a deeper level. But it's hard to give a specific answer, because we don't know anything about her taste or background. Has she seen movies by directors like Tarkovsky, Ozu, Mizoguchi, Antonioni, Bergman, Kiarostami, Haneke, Lynch, Kubrick, Truffaut or any other big, great, interesting or important director? What has she seen? Does she need something a little bit like movies by Hitchcock, Coppola or Scorsese that's perhaps more accessible than for example Tarkovsky or Antonioni? Where does she stand? Has she seen many classics? 




  Force Majeure(Swiss)

Not a Swiss movie, it's Swedish. 




 If you want some great and puzzling movies that aren't concerned with overexplaining everything to the viewer, I would suggest these:   

* Eden and After (1970)    
* Last Year at Marienbad (1961)   
* The Limits of Control (2009)      









 I can't answer your first question, but I can really recommend the Bergman box set, three really great films, two of his absolutely best ones as well. About the Dreyer set, there's a Blu-ray collection BFI released recently that has all of the films that are in the Criterion box, also the same documentary. It's not that pricy right now, could be worth looking into. 









 No, it won't. It's a documentary. That top list only includes feature films. 




 Le rvlateur (1968) by Philippe Garrel is superb. 




 If you like Barry Lyndon (1975) and Mr. Turner (2014), I would suggest checking out The Go-Between (1971), The Draughtsman's Contract (1982) and Nightwatching (2007). 




 1. Norte, the End of History (2013)   
2. The Turin Horse (2011)   
3. The Day He Arrives (2011)   
4. Amour (2012)   
5. The Act of Killing (2012)   




 You should check out The Straight Story (1999) by David Lynch, it's quite similar to Nebraska (2013). 




 Well, it depends. If you are into Resnais and Robbe-Grillet (who wrote the script) and have studied their films a bit, then maybe not. I know that many viewers find the film quite incomprehensible though. With that said, it's not a film that's in any way "easy". 




 Well, rarely have I seen a movie that explores the problems of our existence (mostly communication) and the impossibility to know another person as good as Hiroshima mon amour (1959), because it really does it in such interesting ways. It has much to do with memories, time, space, and subjectivity, and the premise with two lovers from different countries together with the war perspective gives it a rich and nuanced look at all those things. I really like how the film is about opposites and contradictions, which you can get to know directly as it starts as well as the differences between the lovers and many other things. Also, it discusses those things very well. It's a bit hard talking about it without spoiling everything to you, but I assure you it's a special movie! The cinematography is beautiful as well as the music, and the whole story is cleverly told with memories, flashbacks, the past, voice-overs, and the present.      

It's hard to compare it to other films, because I think it's really unique. It's mostly similar to Last Year at Marienbad (1961), that was also directed by Resnais. Other than that, I can think of Silence Has No Wings (1966) by Kazuo Kuroki, Farewell to the Summer Light (1968) by Yoshishige Yoshida, and maybe The Mirror (1975) by Andrei Tarkovsky. 




 Quentin Tarantino borrows quite heavily (and even copies) from other directors and films. Whether it be from Jean-Luc Godard, Japanese samurai movies, Hong-Kong action, exploitation movies, martial arts films, or spaghetti-westerns. So a lot of what you see in his films are homages to films he himself admires. He gets a lot of credit of being original, which I think he really doesn't deserve. A big majority of his fans have never even heard about the films he borrows from.    

But yeah, there's some other examples worth mentioning. I'd like to take three of my favourites for the moment:      

* Yasujir Ozu    
A quite unique director. He mostly positioned his camera very low, often only one foot above the ground or a little higher. This was called the "tatami shot", something he is credited for inventing. Also, he rarely moved the camera, almost nothing at all if you go further into his career. One other thing he was known for was breaking the 180-degree rule, so when he filmed conversations, the camera would look directly into the characters, placing the viewer in the middle of the scene. These are just some of the small things that set him apart from many other filmmakers.  

* Robert Bresson   
Instead of having myself repeat everything I've said about this man, I'll link to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/3amtws/how_can_i_get_robert_bresson/cse44vs) answer that I gave in another subreddit concerning a discussion about him. There's some stuff written down in the English Wikipedia article what sets him apart from others as well. There's literally no one like Bresson, because he invented his own "rules" and idea of filmmaking.    

* Yoshishige Yoshida   
A director that really deserves more attention. I you look at films like Farewell to the Summer Light (1968), Eros Plus Massacre (1969), Heroic Purgatory (1970), or Confessions Among Actresses (1971), you can see Yoshida has a very distinct style, at least he had it pretty much in the sixties. He often emphasized corners, placing the camera in a lot of different positions where others rarely did. His mise en scne is quite special in how he placed characters, where the placed the camera and how he edited everything. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiOnETIFQCY)	is a great example from the opening sequence in Heroic Purgatory (1970).   

There's plenty others to mention too, like Wong Kar-wai, Andrei Tarkovsky, Theo Angelopoulos, Jean-Pierre Melville, Peter Greenaway, Kenji Mizoguchi, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Jacques Tati, Jean-Luc Godard, Tsai Ming-liang, Shji Terayama, Stan Brakhage, Bla Tarr, Aki Kaurismki, Sharunas Bartas, Roy Andersson, Sergio Leone, Dario Argento etc. And you have of course the more classic filmmakers that had unique styles as well, like Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick, to name two. 









 Diabolique (1955). 




 Yeah, I've seen it. It's a nice little road movie with interesting characters and a warm feeling overall. It's interesting that the movie was released by Walt Disney Pictures, heh. I wouldn't call it one of the best pictures from David Lynch though, but as I said, it's of course not bad at all. 









 I would suggest watching the the even longer version that runs at 251 minutes. There's big differences. The US version that clocks in at 139 minutes is totally rearranged so that the narrative is in chronological order, which just butchers the non-chronological story the film has from the beginning. Maybe I shouldn't spoil everything they cut, but it's a lot, and this just makes the film lose a lot of what's actually good in it. And if you ask me, you absolutely don't have the epic feeling in the shorter versions, which is kind of essential for the film from the start. 




 Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion (1970) by Elio Petri. Cool soundtrack by Morricone and an amazing performance by Gian Maria Volont. Great use of flashback scenes mixed with the viewpoint from the protagonist. Even funny at times, especially because of how absurd the situation is. A lovely dark satire about police investigations, corruption and standing above the law. Also a commentary about the Italian government in the late 1960s and early 70s. This one really sticks with you! 




 http://www.blu-ray.com/ is good. 




 Yeah, Black Narcissus (1947) is absolutely another one of their best looking films. Don't forget to check out The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943) as well, also in Technicolor. 




 Not my favourite movie by Powell   Pressburger, but it's certainly not bad at all! The dance scenes are really cool and it's interesting how they are integrated in the whole movie. And yeah, the colors are just gorgeous.   

Here's two essays about it that could interest you:     

http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1518-the-red-shoes-dancing-for-your-life     
http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/51-the-red-shoes 




 The Intouchables (2011). 




 I would suggest Late Ozu. If you ask me, it's the best one of those. You get five fine Ozu films, what's not to like about that? 




 Judging by the posters, this could very much end up being the best movie of all time. Just kidding. 




 Have you seen The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985)? Also directed by Woody Allen, so it's a quite similar when it comes to those fantasy elements. 




 Out of those on your list, I would recommend Odd Man Out (1947) and Three Outlaw Samurai (1964). You get in my opinion of the best British film noirs and one of the best samurai movies. 




 Yeah, of course. Two of my absolute favourite biopics are Andrei Rublev (1966) and Eros Plus Massacre (1969), both masterpieces in my opinion. I feel that Eros Plus Massacre (1969) is a bit overlooked too, so it could as well fit in into a list like that. 




 Edvard Munch (1974) by Peter Watkins is really, really good. Great to see it mentioned. A biopic I would rank very high. I love Watkin's documentary form and how he uses it to explore ideas that didn't only put Munch in the focus, but rather the time period and the people that lived in it. 




 * A Zed   Two Noughts (1985): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lhxlvYF4     
* Dead Man (1995): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx3ajYfbzcw    
* Once Upon a Time in the West (1968): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6BQKFs3-VM    
* Silence Has No Wings (1966): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBB1vlExQFo     
* The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yIkWGmZ1g    




 That movie is so good. Very existential. Would love a Blu-ray release of it, it really deserves it. 




 Really? Then you have missed something! It's set in the Philipines in 1945, at the end of WWII. Abandoned by their command and facing starvation, the Japanese Imperial Army are being reduced to small groups hiding in the jungles. In the midst of this, the situation just gets worse when some of the men go insane and resort to murder and cannibalism. We get to follow Tamura, a soldier who tries to survive without giving up his own principles. It's a must see. 




 Fires on the Plain (1959) by Kon Ichikawa. A really devastating, nightmarish, dirty, chaotic and absurd depiction of war and what it does to people. 




 Tokyo Story (1953) is one of Ozu's best films and just has to be seen. It's a mellow, beautiful, tragic and very important post-war film, as it explores family matters in a very nuanced and rich way, setting the old against the new, something which Ozu often did and gave us at the same time a glimpse into Japanese culture and the everyday lives of people. It's also shot in an uncompromising matter with many excellent and static shots. Nothing is rushed. And yeah, two of my favourite actors, Chish Ry and Setsuko Hara are in it as well and both are doing some of their best performances. They have those faces that look so friendly that you just can't hate them. Pick it up! 




 Clo from 5 to 7 (1962) by Agns Varda is great. For those who haven't seen it, it's about a French singer, who is afraid of getting the result of a test from her doctor. She thinks she has cancer and that she'll die. The whole movie takes place in Paris where we follow her for two hours while she is wandering through the streets and meeting people. 




 To be honest, I can't think of any I actually would like to see. There's enough already and there's new reboots coming almost all the time. I'd rather see movies not connected with past franchises coming. These big franchises that are getting revived on and on nowadays are mostly unoriginal and contain very generic forms of repetition, whether it's in ideas, narratives, stories, characters or form, it's rarely that you actually see something that actually stands out in terms of how they are made. Of course, this can apply to movies that aren't based on these franchises as well, but then you have at least something free from the start, and not something that's following certain formulas. 




 The Seventh Continent (1989) by Michael Haneke.             

Here's what I wrote about it in another subreddit too, if someone is wondering why:     


 For those who haven't seen it, it's about a middle-class couple that's living together with their daughter. They dream of escaping to Australia to start a new life. Their current life is monotonous and full of routines, but they decide to do something about it one day. First of all, I love the form and how uncompromising it is. There is no soundtrack, so the little music that exists in the film is diegetic. The color palette is very dry and bleak, just like the overall atmosphere. Haneke takes his time by telling the story with long and static takes instead of moving the camera, which I'm a big fan of, I think that just adds to the form and connects well with the monotonous life of the family. There's no clear answers, which I also admire Haneke for, he is great when it comes to asking important questions and making his audience think and feel.           
There's no other movie that made me feel as much as this one. It's just crushing. It's like a punch in the gut. The Seventh Continent (1989) also gives some interesting discussions about alienation, existentialism, society and materialism. One of my favourite scenes is the one with the family sitting and just staring while their TV is on with the song "The Power of Love" playing, a wonderful juxtaposition considering the nihilistic tone and depressing atmosphere the movie actually has.
I can go on talking about it a bit more, but I'm not going to spoil out everything here, so this will do as for now. In my opinion, this movie is simply amazing and a true masterpiece.   




  You're averaging 3 or more movies a day?!   

Something like that, maybe. I don't know the exact average number.      


 This is part of your day job, right?    

No, it isn't. 




 No. I use Filmtipset and ICheckMovies to rate and keep track of what I've seen. 




 The Story of Film: An Odyssey (2011). 




 535, but then I'm not counting rewatched movies. 




 I don't think he cares, he's still making a shitload of money. As long as people pay for his movies, critics are probably his least concern. 




 * A Zed   Two Noughts (1985)      
* Dead Man (1995)     
* Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)     
* Silence Has No Wings (1966)      
* The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)       




 Thumbs up. Great trilogy. Love me some Fassbinder. 




 * Naked (1993)    
* Rififi (1955)   
* Wings of Desire (1987) 
* World on a Wire (1973)   

I would narrow it down to those. All of them are great, especially Naked (1993) and Wings of Desire (1987). I remember that it didn't take long until I rewatched Naked (1993) after the first time I saw it. It's really dark with bits of comedy as black as the rest of the film. Johnny is one of the most interesting protagonists I've ever seen. He's just so broken, quite like the rest of the people he is meeting. The whole film is filled with sharp dialogue and never gets boring. David Thewlis did an amazing performance. It really sticks with you. There's really something special about it!    

And Wings of Desire (1987) is a very nice pick as well. One of Wim Winder's best ones. Philosophical, a bit romantic and beautiful cinematography to enjoy. Charming, cool, thoughtful and full of emotion. 




 A movie that's underrated isn't the same thing as a movie that most people haven't heard of. You could say that a movie most people haven't heard of is unknown, but underrated is a whole different thing. Underrated is something you can apply to a movie that the majority of people don't like, or to a movie that you feel isn't rated high enough, it doesn't have to do with how known or unknown it is. 









 It ends. 




 It actually takes place during the Middle Ages as well, but it's mostly a bit uncertain when it actually took place, but in contrast with Andrei Rublev (1966) that has a timeline and is based around a real person, Marketa Lazarov (1967) is based on a legend. The movie has a strong vibe of religion too, as it's set against the backdrop of Christianity replacing Paganism. There's also a feud between two rival medieval clans, somewhat like in Andrei Rublev (1966) where you have the rivalry between the princes and Tatars. So there's even some similar content on the story side. 




 I'm glad to hear that! Feel free to let me know what you thought about it afterwards if you are going to watch it! 




 Strange, it works for me. I updated the link, try now? 




 I wouldn't say that either of them actually did amazing films from the beginning. It seems like a stretch to say that, but that's on the other hand my opinion. Anyways, I guess you could make a comparison like that if you want. Some people would probably agree with you. There's probably other directors that could fit in as well. In the end, it's mostly about taste. 




 This upcoming Yoshida box set that will be a limited edition is a must:   
http://www.arrowfilms.co.uk/shop/index.php?route=product/product keyword=kiju product_id=571%22 




 Really? I'm glad to hear that! It's truly unique and amazing. If you liked it that much, I really recommend checking out Woman in the Dunes (1964) by Teshigahara (the same director) as well. It's not a science fiction film, but it's just as brilliant as The Face of Another (1966) and also based on a book by Kb Abe.    

And about the titles, I think I'll just try it. 




 Not really. 




 You should watch Wild Strawberries (1957) by Ingmar Bergman. 









 Ant-Man (2015). 




 Because one likes statistics? I like to have everything I've seen written down and rated. I also have some other statistics, movies I've seen by decades, how many movies I've seen by every director, how many movies I've seen from different countries etc. It can be helpful in many ways. I myself have all my stats on a specific website, and that has certainly helped me to discover hundreds of new films and directors. So, that's some of the benefits. Depending on how you do it, it can help you discover a lot of new stuff. I also like to see how my taste develops with time. 




 Yes, indeed. I keep track of the movies I've watched and rate them as well. I have rated 3771 films so far. I rate them from 1 to 5, so I only have five different grades. 




 Oh. Yeah, man. Interstellar (2014) was so overly clear that it really twisted my brain when the movie on an on kept explaining everything to the audience. And yeah, Sucker Punch (2011) was so horrible that my brain literally exploded. What a twist! 




 Great! Yeah, that's some good stuff. Tarkovsky is my favourite director, what a man. A fun little trivia is that Konstantin Lopushanskiy was an assistant director to Stalker (1979). And his own movies are a bit similar to Tarkovsky's work, especially Tarkovsky's science fiction movies. 




 It's been like that a while. But luckily, there's movies made outside of Hollywood too. 




 Here's ten great foreign science fiction movies:   

* Fantastic Planet (1973) *(Ren Laloux)*   
* La jete (1962) *(Chris Marker)*  
* Letters from a Dead Man (1986) *(Konstantin Lopushanskiy)*   
* Metropolis (1927) *(Fritz Lang)*    
* Solaris (1972) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*      
* Stalker (1979) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*      
* The Face of Another (1966) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*  
* Visitor of a Museum (1989) *(Konstantin Lopushanskiy)*    
* Woman in the Moon (1929) *(Fritz Lang)*   
* World on a Wire (1973) *(Rainer Werner Fassbinder)*   

I especially recommend The Face of Another (1966), Solaris (1972) and Stalker (1979), because all those three are what I would consider some of the best movies of all time. 




 Marketa Lazarov (1967) is beautiful, a bit similar to Andrei Rublev (1966). 




 Right now it's mostly these five:   

* Cemetery of Splendor (2015) *(Apichatpong Weerasethakul)*     
* Our Little Sister (2015) *(Hirokazu Koreeda)*   
* Right Now, Wrong Then (2015) *(Hong Sang-soo)*      
* Sweet Red Bean Paste (2015) *(Naomi Kawase)*      
* Taxi (2015) *(Jafar Panahi)*      




 The Apu Trilogy by Satyajit Ray:    

* Pather Panchali (1955)   
* Aparajito (1957)    
* The World of Apu (1959)    

A great series that has three films with very connected plots. I have no idea if you are familiar with the films or if you have seen them, but it's some good stuff. There's been a lot of talk about the trilogy lately, mostly because of new restorations that have been screen recently. Also, Criterion Collection are releasing the trilogy on Blu-ray sooner or later. The first one was Satyajit Ray's first feature film, which is impressing if you look at the quality of the work.   

The three films form a very beautiful narrative, a bit of a coming of age-feeling about the the childhood, education and early maturity of a young Bengali boy named Apu in the early part of the 20th century where we start watching him growing up in poverty with his family. 




 The Seventh Continent (1989) is my favourite, I don't change it just because I'm drunk or whatever. 




  Why haven't they made a Mega Man live action film yet?   

Who? People? Eddie Lebron directed a live action movie called Megaman (2010). 




 I think people who are confused by his films mostly are those that don't have any deeper interest in films and cinema overall, the ones who don't watch movies so often. While I'm not a fan of Nolan, I find his films rather the opposite of confusing, I feel that they are too clear and that he explains too much with exposition in dialogue, voice-over etc. 




 Stalker (1979) and Letters from a Dead Man (1986). 




 Ten of my favourites:    

* Apocalypse Now (1979) *(Francis Ford Coppola)*    
* Army of Shadows (1969) *(Jean-Pierre Melville)*    
* Ashes and Diamonds (1958) *(Andrzej Wajda)*    
* Come and See (1985) *(Elem Klimov)*    
* Fires on the Plain (1959) *(Kon Ichikawa)*    
* Ivan's Childhood (1962) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*        
* La Commune (Paris, 1871) (2000) *(Peter Watkins)*    
* The Ascent (1977) *(Larisa Shepitko)*    
* The Battle of Algiers (1966) *(Gillo Pontecorvo)*    
* The Red and the White (1967) *(Mikls Jancs)*     




 Do tell afterwards! 









 Hard to take that list seriously with that name when Moon (2009) is the first one. 




 I read about them, but don't really put the focus on ratings. If something sounds interesting or if I want to watch it for some reason, I usually end up watching it. I see a lot of stuff that doesn't even have reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, so there's not so much to do about that anyways. I also have several different watchlists to help me as well. 




 I'm glad that you appreciate how much I love that damn movie! 




 I've never "trusted" those sites in the first place. I think it's too bad that people seem to see some objectivity in them, as if movies with high scores/ratings automatically must be good, same with IMDb. If you are interested in watching a movie, watch it. Don't let others be the judge of what you'll watch or not. It's okay to be dissappointed by a movie, it's not the whole world. 




 Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975). 




 Yeah, I know. The fact that they are releasing one of his films in September makes me have some hope! Anyways, even if Criterion won't release it on Blu-ray, somebody must do it! 









 Great! A must watch. I'm curious to see how it looks now! Let's hope that this will air in other countries as well. And let's also hope for a Blu-ray release, maybe Criterion can do that.

  Finding Mr. Destiny (Japanese flim, but worth it)

Why the "but"? Are you making some sort of implication with it? I don't get it. Anyways, you are quite on the wrong side if you are referring to the one directed by Jang Yu-jung (which I'm guessing you are), it's not a Japanese movie at all, it's South Korean. 




  What movies do you think will be remembered, let's say, 15 years from now when people think of the 00-decade?    

Mulholland Dr. (2001). 




 I really like Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles	(1975). 




 Isn't it obvious that it depends on the actors, the directors and the movies? There's so many other things that would matter, so it's impossible to say anything definitive in the way that you are asking the question. But for example, I liked that Fassbinder had a special team of actors that he frequently used in his films. Same with Ozu. Chish Ry acted in 32 of Ozu's 54 films, a fun and interesting fact.   
In those cases, it mostly worked splendid, but then there are other cases with other directors and actors that weren't too well off. Surely, if a combination works great, I have nothing against it if I see it again. On the other hand, change can be good as well. But as I said, it depends on so many factors.    


I remember when Robert Bresson was asked if he would use Claude Laydu in his films again, he replied with this:   

*"I robbed him of what I needed to make the film. How could I rob him twice?*    

It's very interesting that he said it like that, but then again, you probably have to know about the way he worked and his own "rules" had to fully understand what he meant, heh. 




 Jonathan Rosenbaum. 




 https://www.icheckmovies.com/movies/?page=1 sort=officialtoplists    

Go there, check out the movies that are in the most lists, and go from there. Of course, you shouldn't really care how many lists certain movies are in, but in this  particular scenario, the first pages manages to get you acquainted with some of the most important, influental, widely referenced, and critically acclaimed movies of all time. If you go and look through the first pages, you'll find a great overview for some movies that are mandatory to have seen if you are trying to build up some sort of interest in cinema.     


Also, this list is great for this too, even if it's a bit more than 25:   
http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/directors/    

Anyways, you'll get a good start if you look into my suggestions. And if you want my personal top 25 favourites, just ask for it. 









 Bolshoe kosmicheskoe puteshestvie (1975) by Valentin Selivanov:    
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0321492/    




 One of my favourites, I love this movie. Actually rewatched it weeks ago. It looks stunning on Blu-ray. 




 If I must choose, I would take The Night of the Hunter (1955). 




 Hexen bis aufs Blut geqult (1970). The English title is Mark of the Devil. A dirty exploitation horror flick about witchcraft, witchfinders and love. It has an amazing soundtrack that really sticks with you. 




 I understand why! That movie is truly beautiful. 




 I can suggest reading Film Art: An Introduction by David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson. It's a great book to start with if you are getting interested in movies. It's kind of a basic introduction to the analysis of cinema and helps you with the understanding of films in many different ways. 




 Have you seen Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) by Yoshishige Yoshida? If not, it's a must see. 




 Of course it matters. And of course there's a point complaining about it, but only if you want to, feel the need to and want to be honest. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I don't think your specific one automatically loses its importance just because a big majority of people loved it. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989):       
A couple and their daughter are living a monotonous life filled with daily routines, but decide to something about it one day. 




 Great choice! Probably the best movie by Greenaway. Pure eye candy and also a smart and very interesting film. I love the symmetric mise-en-scne and the wonderful soundtrack by Michael Nyman. 




 **[Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064296)** by Yoshishige Yoshida. One of the best films ever made that should have some more attention here. Besides being a biography about the anarchist Sakae sugi, it also explores his relationships with three different women in the 1920s. And parallel to that story, we also get to follow two students in the 1960s that are exploring sugi's ideas and theories.    


First off, Yoshida's cinematography is in my opinion aesthetic perfection, especially the framing where he uses spaces, corners, well picked and inventive camera positions to form his special mise-en-scne, putting the characters in context with the surroundings. And if we sway away a bit from the visual part, it's a very nuanced, rich, and complex depiction of sex, love, politics and history where past and present both interweave into each other and comment themselves. A true masterpiece. 




 L'eclisse (1962) and Pickpocket (1959)! You gotta have some Antonioni and Bresson! 




 I'll be getting Hiroshima mon amour (1959) for sure. Other than that one, I have these high up on my list as well:   

* 8 (1963)   
* Il sorpasso (1962)    
* Marketa Lazarov (1967)   
* Nema-ye Nazdik (1990)    
* Smultronstllet (1957)     
* Tky monogatari (1953)    
* Welt am Draht (1973)     

It's hard to pick out almost anything without ruining your wallet! 














 I think it's best starting with the original trilogy, the order in which they were released. Those are as well the more important ones in the Star Wars saga, at least if we talk about cultural significance, critical acclaim and pop culture references.
