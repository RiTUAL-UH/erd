 Careless with the packaging. Angry gf must have packed into an ex-box. 









 I'm coming over

 It's the html widget. Last button from your tool bar on the left. It will drop a box on to your screen that you can drag/size however you want and paste the html for your ad. 




 Yes, use wordpress, BUT not Wordpress.com. Get hosting with another hosting provider and install wordpress there. There's a huge difference between having a wordpress site and having a Wordpress.com site. The themes, plugins, widgets, etc are all proprietary on wordpress.com. 




 No.. Yes... 




 Idk what the problem is, looks like all the toys came with the right package... 




 Intentionally crooked frame with level image.. I don't trust it. 





























 This Egg Didn't Choose the Thug Life 




 Unless you're selling privately, 10% is the industry norm... (Flippa, Sedo, etc.) Afternic is 20%, however that'll probably change seeing that GoDaddy acquired them. 




 I can tackle it for you. I broker domains and process all exchanges thru Escrow.com to ensure an honest sale. Feel free to reach out. 




 I'm too lazy to search, so do trial and error. If a host rejects masking, it will just resolve to a blank white page. Then you'll know. 
























 Must have had pretty severe whiplash 




 Well then the first thing I'm buying is a Kardashian 




 Claire Underwood strikes again... 




 I'm just high 





























 Nope, doesn't count. Little guy front row to the right fucked up 




 I think this joke has a testosterone prerequisite 




 You know how I know you're gay? You listen to Coldplay 




 "Backstreets Back Alri...awh fuck!" 




 Gross, take your upvote and punch me in the face 
























 I have a Sony A6000 and I've also had a few Canons and Nikons. I LOVE my Sony. The af and shutterspeed are amazing perks to their line. The only gripe I have is the digital viewfinder. But being that it IS mirrorless, what else would I expect? Don't get me wrong, they do a great job with it, however it can be a bit frustrating. 

The lag isn't bad at all, but definitely noticeable when shooting a moving object. 




 Can anybody here refer me to the best bargain for Canvas Prints?

I want to start putting some of my work on display, and although I don't expect large 3 panel split canvases to be cheap, I am still looking for the best bang for my buck.

Cheapest place I have found so far is Costco, plus they conveniently let me upload my photos and I can preview each concept.

Any/all information is appreciated! 









 I saw the same sign at an abortion clinic 




 It looks like it could get me really high

 Well then I ask you at what point does a person go from being creepy to being romantic?

 Me and a friend got fucked up after dipping our blunt in liquid codeine and decided to try finding a genre porn that doesn't exist. We searched everything. For example, here were some of our discoveries.

The following exist:
-Almost any childhood cartoon you can think of has a porn spinoff
-Amputee porn
-Puke porn
-Poop porn (disturbingly common)
-Actual Donkey punching

However we did not find anything in the area of mental disability porn... so yeah, i suppose the only way to win that game was to end up on something that doesn't exist because it's a shameful thought in the first place.

Amputee porn made my dick twitch 




 Flexibility 
























 Too bad you couldn't circumvent the situation...
