 https://www.snapchat.com/geofilters/tips.html

The link guides you through how to make a geofilter for snapchat. Boulder has one (I'm not a fan of it),  but CU does not have one. While some off you don't use snapchat, some of you enjoy graphic design. Depending on how many people submit something, I may give out reddit gifts/gold. 
Ideas you may consider- notable buildings, Ralphie, the Flatirons, scenic area, or any design you can come up with.  








































































































 I know Eldora's terrain park is nothing  to brag about, especially compared to other Colorado resorts. Can anyone who's gone recently give me an idea of what to expect when I go later this week? I usually stick to medium sized features so hopefully a good amount of those.

 What needs to fall into place, what games do you need to win, what miracles must occur?  



















 Regardless of actual snowfall, which cities complain the most about snow?  
























 Looking for opinions. I personally think Keystone and A Basin are good for days without snow. Everyone has their spots at certain areas  




 Title says it all. Would be cool to see how much money programs get from their conference and how much comes from big games like this  




 I'm in arts and sciences (iphy) and want to take a basic marketing and maybe a management course. I have an opportunity to work in pharmaceutical sales for a bit after school before graduate school. I looked at theses course and they all are restricted to business schools students or have bcor prerequisites. Does anyone know of any that an A and S student can take? I'm a senior so I meet house requirements as well  









 Last final is Wed, that means Thursday is ski day. I can go to eldora, Winter Park, and the epic local areas. Who wants to go?  




 For Colorado, Ski Booker. Shooting 37% with 2.3 turnovers a game. He has 99 FGA, the next highest on the team is Scott with 67 FGA. The only think Booker contributes is steals and assist. 

edit- now he goes 7/14 for 20pts today. of course.  









 Went to doc two months ago after sleeping 8 hours in 3 days. He gave me 5mg ambien. Worked well as a half dose, some nights I needed the full 5mg. Just started my 3rd bottle, fell asleep at 5am, 5 hours after taking it. Sleept til 11am. 
Then this time I took full 5mg at 12 am, a half at 1am, and at 2 am. It's now 6am and I feel tired but awake  














 Oregon wins and they are in the playoffs, Arizona wins, they are in and Oregon is out (unless all other top teams lose). Who do you think should represent the pac in playoffs and why?  




 Going to eldora friday (opening  day). Looking for people to ski with this year if anyone wants to go. I'm into all aspects of skiing, have an eldora, epic local, and winter Park pass  




 I want a small plant for my desk that can handle low sunlight  light and dry air. What do you have? 









 First game thread so bear with me.
Looks like tip off may be delayed due to SMU/Gonzaga. I'll be ducking out of here after the first half since I still have early morning midterms so if any streams or other edits come available please comment them.

 Following 3 straight NCAA tournament appearances, you're Colorado Buffaloes take on Drexel in the first game of the year. Game is Friday at 6pm in Boulder. Stubhub tickets are selling for $6. 
Colorado is ranked in the top 30 nationally, predicted 6 seed for the NCAA tournament. 




 I recently found out Eldora used to have night skiing but haven't seen anything on why they no longer offer it. Below is a night trail map. I'm guessing it had to do with forest service, night traffic on the canyon, or not being profitable. I've night skied at Keystone and it was empty but  I figure night skiing would do better at Eldora since it's so close to Boulder. 


http://www.coloradoskihistory.com/images/eldora_overview_1.jpg

 









 Title says it all. Yes it is more basketball relevant but we're at the time where  other sports overlap. I wanted to post here to keep things a bit civil versus r/cfb and r/collegebasketball people yelling at Eachother. 

Has the UNC scandal changed your view on players receiving payment?

Personally I would be for taking for away scholarships and paying players under $100k. I'm not in favor of more successful schools getting to pay more money, then they just keep buying more talent and competition is gone.  









 I just signed up for skicarpool.org and it's pretty active, is anyone signed up with something  better? I'm looking to help people carpool, everyone knows i70 could use a break  









 Since Colorado and Wazzu are the bottom two but unfortunately don't play each other, I'd like to open up a discussion of predictions if they did. 

Colorado- 0-6 (2-7)
key games- overtime loss to Cal and UCLA 

Wazzu- 1-5 (2-7)
key games- win at Utah, close games against Oregon and Cal

Edit- pretend Halliday is playing  




 Got my first eldora pass (college discounted) and have never been. I'm looking at driving up for opening weekend, is it worth it? I've done A-Basin when they have just a few runs open and enjoy it but don't find it to be worth the drive since you spend so much time in line. 
Also, anyone that wants someone to ski with, I'm in Boulder with epic local and eldora passes  



















 Looking at getting an eldora pass to go along with my epic local. I didnt get much time to drive i70 last year and want to get more days in so eldora is a huge appeal. It's $179 for the season pass, prices go up to $229 on Nov 4. 

I don't know anyone who goes to eldora, anyone looking for someone to ski with? 

Also anyone with epic local.

Site crashed for a bit this morning, Arizona is almost sold out. Get tickets now! 




 http://espn.go.com/college-football/statistics
 


































 I will have the epic local college pass but because of my schedule I won't get out to summit as often as I'd like (enough for the pass to be worth the money). I'm also considering the Elodora college pass ($159) since it's closer to Boulder. 

 I've never been to Eldora and know it's smaller but the bus from Boulder is a great appeal. I saw it's added to the WP/Copper pass which will add to the crowds. 

Would it be worth getting the pass for days that I can't make it to summit? Is the terrain/snow as bad as they say?  














 I searched the sub to see if its been asked and I didnt see anything so I will be another EMT B student asking a question. 

Is it worth keeping your class books after completion and passing the registry exam for review or reference?  









 I'm currently an under grad finishing General Chemistry 2. I will be taking Organic 1 in the spring. I have looked around at general prerequisites for school and found a wide range from only general chemistry, to requiring biochemistry (some survey some full). Which level chemistry did you finish with and how limiting/excess was it when applying to programs? 



















 Will take as low as $40 credit 




 I have a camera but it can't do night scenes very well. 
I would love a picture of the flagstaff star with Venus (which is very bright the next few days) and maybe even the moon in the shot. 
I'm sure any photographers reading this may think it could make a great shot. Maybe with CU or any other boulder landmarks as well. 
Anyone willing to take the shot and post it? 




 I'm sure you get a lot of these questions but I'm looking for a good study guide for the EMT-B exam. I won't be taking it until this summer but there are way too many options to choose from.  




 just what title says, thanks  




 For any of those who have their name on their job shirts, do you use full name, first name last initial, or first initial last name? The latter seems more professional but patients would typically call you by first name which is easier to remember if it's right on your shirt. 




 tapped out started crashing for me a few hours ago. After I tap the continue page it will load for 5-10 sec then crash. I have tried reinstalling the app and turning my phone off/on. Anyone else experiencing this?
Iphone 5/ios 7 




 I have a pair of 2012/13 liberty helixes. I bought them used and they had a demo binding on them (removed before I bought them). I was able to center mount them and rode them 3x before season end. I am considering remounting them to cab forward. I had salomon suspects for 5 years before this pair and had those center mounted as well. On the helix i was having difficulty staying afloat in the powder and initiating turns on groomers. I'm not sure if this is from not being used to the ski or if i should move my binding to cab forward. 
so should i try moving them knowing that once i do they are stuck there for good, and how should they hold up with 3 binding mounts done?

i tried finding a ski gear subreddit and the best was wintergear with no activity, if this should be in a different subreddit i will happily move it. 




 Season 8 ep 1. Quinn says Barney wants to ride down the isle on a bear. The ring bear? 
Caught my attention while watching today  




 I'm sure most of you are familiar with the Gilbert white memorial flood maker next to Boulder Creek at Broadway. I have been searching for good pictures of the marker with the flood waters, kind of like a snow stick at ski resorts. I have only found pictures with the marker when flood waters have receded. Does anyone know of any good ones?  




 I wish i was good with graphics but Im not. I would love to see something like this with the events of the boulder flood, maybe even extended the whole front range.  




 is there a way to change the default view back to month instead of week? 
also, i find it annoying how "zoomed in" the times are, only showing a few hours before you need to scroll.  














 not seeing the game thread and cant find a steam,
any help? 




 last year vail gave a college discount on the epic local bringing it down to ~$350. Does anyone (especially someone on the inside) know if this will happen again this year?  




 And the control center didn't with me a happy birthday....

 I know this girl personally and her charity has really taken off recently. I know she would love some more support. Here is the description written by her--

Hi! My name is Emma Rose. I am a 17 year old Leukemia (ALL) patient. I was diagnosed with cancer in January, 2012. It has been a tough year, but I am finally feeling better. I am in the maintenance phase of my treatment. Even though this is the "easiest" part of my treatment, it still consists of daily oral chemo and almost monthly spinal taps until May 2014. Since my diagnosis, so many people have helped my family and me in many ways. Now, I want to do something to give back. I want to help other kids with cancer who are also being treated at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.  We collect comfort items the kids can use during their stay- especially pillow pets, soft blankets, fuzzy socks, iTune gift cards, ear buds, packs of gum, leggo kits, nail polish, glow sticks, and crayons. Our newest Wishlists are on Amazon. If interested in donating gifts to help the Kids at Children's WI, please go to Amazon, click on Wish Lists and then search for Emma Rose. We just completed a major donation drive called "Movie Night". Thanks to the generosity of our followers and WE Energies' donation of 100 copies of Honor Flight- The Movie, we were able to put together 100 movie tubs for the kids. Each tub contained several movies, popcorn, candy and other items for the children and their families. The tubs were given to the children on the HOT Unit, in MACC Clinic, in the BMT Clinic and at Ronald McDonald House. Since the children cannot go to the movie theater, I wanted to bring the movie theater experience to them. Thank you so much! Please make sure all donations are new and in their original packages. All mail and packages can be sent to Emma Rose, PO Box 485, Thiensville, WI 53092. Thank you so much for your generosity!  Emma Rose 




 r/snowboarding is legit, /r/skiing doesnt have enough park, lets get it 









 rewatch the first episode. Its even better with the knowledge after watching all other episodes. pick up things you missed, and find things more humorous  





























 I saw in a thread someone commenting that they thought every character would meet the mother before Ted. Well, they were right according to the CBS president. They all meet her at the wedding before Ted and he only meets her after a big chunk of the season is done. I believe they said before that he meets her on the train returning from the wedding 





























 Now I already expect to get down votes shoved up my ass for this thread but I dont care because my life doesnt revolve around reddit karma. 
Before you downvote and click back without reading, read a bit of this. 
Why do people hate the Miami Heat? The answer- they all jumped on the hate train. 
1. Heat fans are bandwagon fans. Id like to argue that its cooler to hate the heat than like them. So by hating, you joined that band wagon. I became a Heat fan when they drafted Wade. I watched Wade a season ticket holder for Marquette. I never cared for the bucks because they never caught my interest. You dont have to be a fan of your local team, everyone has their reasons for liking a team. I was a fan before Lebron and the Big 3 yet everyone assumes Im a fan because of Lebron. Wade won Miami's first title in 2006.
Before someone says "Jimmy Butler played for Marq, shouldnt you be a bulls fan? No. While I love to see how well he is doing, Wade is still my favorite Marq player. Not just because of skill, but how he is off the court. Read up on his divorce and life with his sons.

2. "Lebron is a traitor/sellout"- Cleveland didnt have a chance of a title in the near future so Lebron went somewhere he could win. So what? Every player in the NBA wants to win a title. Its a lifelong dream for professional athletes. If your a Cleveland fan who hates lebron, you should be hating the management for not building a better team before lebron left. I dont mean a team around lebron or a superstar team, just a better team. 

3. The heat are a superstar team. So what? Part of basketball is trying to build a great team that will build a franchise. When you play pick up games you choose the best players first dont you? Do you all hate the Jordan era bulls? 

4. Bosh is a dinosaur. I dont mind people saying this. Its true and the memes are funny. Thats no reason to hate a player though. There are plenty of uglier players. 

5. Lebron is compared to Jordan. Thats the standerd for basketball, everyone is looking for the next jordan. Lebron has MVPs and Olympic Medals. He doesnt have the rings but look at his past. Cleveland had no chance. He made the finals his first year with the heat, won the finals the second year, had a 27 game winning streak the 3rd year. He is a damn good player. He is not Jordan. Having him compared to jordan is not a reason to hate him. NBA analyst will always compare great players to Jordan. Kobe gets compared. I dont hate Kobe for that or for being a great player. I dislike him because he has a record for being a selfish asshole who was accused of rape.... (Tosh.0 anyone?)

I'm not saying theres no reason to hate the Heat. Im just saying you should have your reasons and be able to back them up. My reasons listed arent perfect but they are a start. There are reasons to hate Miami, but be able to back yourself up so you arent just another person riding the hate train. 
 
























 What if Rose has not returned because the NBA secretly made him wait until the Bulls v Heat series.
Im not saying this is true or possible, just a thought that sort of fits. 
1. Heat beat bulls for a couple games, but not by a lot. 
2. Rose returns in game 3 or 4
3. Refs influence game or everything just seems to go against Miami
4. Rose and the Bulls take the next games needed to win the series
5. Bulls Heat rivalry heats up
6. Lebron leaves Miami 
7.
8. 
9. NBA Profit?? $$$ 
























 Be great if someone could turn the hand into a downvote

 Anyone have any links for streaming CU vs Oregon St? No one has the pac 12 network 


































 As seen in the [Construction cam] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209458799) the beams are going up. The first beam was erected a couple weeks ago. The height looks odd because a good amount of the facility is underground from the camera angle. The facility is 80ft tall with a full sized track surrounding the football field.   









 Specifically referring to Bernie Sanders plan  



















 I had been using protein shake mixes for years on and off without much gaining. It finally hit me one day that I wouldn't eat for hours after having a shake, they made me feel too full and slightly nauseous. I instead started using preworkout and creatine only, I had used them with shakes beforehand. I drink 3-4 glasses of chocolate milk each day, two immediately after a workout. I noticed I was eating more and now have gained  20 lbs since giving up protein shakes a few months ago. I'm not sure why I'm posting this except to tell anyone who gets irritation from shakes to try something else. There's no universal meal plan for gainers, just meet you calorie goal and eat "healthy" foods.

 The rules- you can only be a fan if: 
You attended/plan to attend the school 
An immediate family member attended the school
Or you live within 150 miles of the school. 

Which school are you a fan of and why? 
Also, does this differ from your flair?  









 I know nothing about the process of adding intramural sports but is anyone interested in intramural lacrosse? I'm guessing the only way to make it happen would be playing no-contact or possibly using women's sticks and rules. Liability comes with physicality. The school has the lacrosse field and goals. Participants would likely need their own equipment. The only real cost to the school would be more refs. 
If anyone knows more about the process or works with the rec center it would be great to get the ball rolling. Lacrosse is the fastest growing sport and Colorado could become the lacrosse capital of the West since the outlaws professional team is good and DU won nationals.  




 I'm thinking 6-7, sweep OOC and manage two pac wins including one big upset at home. Manage to get a bowl game through the weird Hawaii rule

Construction of a 120,000-square-foot indoor multipurpose practice facility on top of Franklin Field, to include a 100-yard artificial turf football field and six-lane 300-meter track;
Refurbishment of the Dal Ward Athletics Center, completed in 1991, to include an Olympic sports strength training room in the sub-basement level and new locker rooms and equipment room on the field level;
Redesigning of Dal Ward's first floor for the expansion of Olympic sports/sports medicine, a leadership development center and an end zone club with club seating and loge boxes;
Transforming the second floor of Dal Ward to triple the athletic department's academic support system from its current 5,000 square feet to 15,000 square feet;
Building additional restrooms and concession areas on the east side of Folsom Field; and
Adding a 21,900-square foot high-performance sports center on the northeast corner of the stadium, as well as a rooftop terrace on the northeast corner, converting the south offices at Folsom Field to retail space. The rooftop terrace will generate revenue by being available for rent for non-game-day events. The high-performance sports center will host collaborative research conducted by CU-Boulder Integrative Physiology faculty and researchers at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus.

 CU is hosting its first field day tomorrow. Students can play yard games or compete against football players in skills stations such as throwing, kicking, catching, 40 yard dash etc. As a student I'm looking forward to it and was wondering if other schools do this. Specifically with CU, its a great way for the program to branch out to the students who have formed some hostility for the program.

I cannot do both because of when classes are available and I am graduating in the fall. I want to get a job in health administration and possibly continue on to graduate school for a MHA. Which path above should I take? My major is in physiology which isn't direclty applicable  to Health administration but I do know some people who landed jobs with similar majors.  





























 Last year I took classes both summer terms so I still had my rec center membership. This year I'm doing the July term only. Do I get a membership for just July or the whole summer?

 A lot of people are staying in Boulder for break. I'm hoping to ski, bike, or hike (possibly camp) every day. I'm hoping to get people together to enjoy the great backyard we have in Boulder.  





























 So we should lower taxes so people have more spending money?  




 No skiing?  









 Just started Division 3 and the opening scene is [this view] (https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/750px-folsom_field.jpg) 




 That was a fumble-6, not an incompletion 
 




 Insert weed joke here  




 I'm watching high school boys intently on Twitter  




 Something something Ralphie something fifth down  




 You know it'll be Kodak or Walmart  




 I have [EPS] (http://youtu.be/tbKOEJIcIKI) 




 Full time college student here, I just work weekends  




 My class actually mentioned those ports and how to handle them in that situation  




 What does it say about U of A when Colorado goes to 2OT against a team that Arizona only beat with a hail mary? 




 [Following the Boulder flood] (https://vimeo.com/77180229). It's not an adrenaline hype video, but pretty damn motivational 




 The double OT game against Cal stands out. I had about 5 heart attacks during it. 
[Highlights start 25 seconds in] (http://youtu.be/J_vsfhQHpSU) 




 2008 called, they want their Obama poster back  




 Most of Colorado already does this. Still use plastic  




 I'll give the CSU section a [nice wink] (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/5c/3e/54/5c3e5469c8349025937ef47b30812ac1.gif) at the RMS  




 In the name of harbaugh, the M, and fucking Ohio State amen.  




 Well this is the first CSU post I did. 
Second, get the fuck off of Ralphie! 




 Trying to find them is God awful  




 Well there goes my summer  




 Winter snow accumulation? Well you've never been to Boulder. It snows one day and is gone the next. Unless it's been cold for days before snowing then the snow will just melt right off the panels on contact  




 Above average. It's enough that 20lbs isn't noticeable, or 50 in your case  














 Water level should be low enough by then  




 Go up flagstaff or sanitas and watch the Folsom field fireworks and the many others over the skyline  




 I'm sure there are, I just listed the ones I knew without searching. I was hoping people would post suggestion to make the last 70 days of off season go by  




 It's early but Paul Richardson (Seahawks) tore his ACL in his rookie season and missed the superbowl. He's come back in the past, hoping he can do it again  




 Pretty sure November 2011 is Sandusky  




 Did a quick search and it looks like a list hasn't been done in awhile, so let this be a list of cfb movies/documentaries on Netflix or online free sites. 

Off the top of my head-

Happy Valley 
30:30 the U
Rudy  




 Wisconsi, not sure if it counts since it's my flair  




 I think they should have a field day once it's done, let people come check it out and throw a ball around.  




 It's definitely enough for lighting, like you said climate control would  be the issue. However  it's cool enough sept through bowl season to not need cooling. I'd imagine they have some very efficient insulation as well. 
I believe I saw somewhere that the facility would also use a feedback loop for climate control, possibly with Folsom field. I've having issues finding it 
Edit- [here's the same company working on making levi stadium net zero] (https://joinmosaic.com/blog/levis-49er-stadium-leads-net-zero-energy-race/) 




 Sure looked like panels when I walked past.  




 The burp girl 
 




 "indoor practice facility is partnering with SunPower to install a 55,000 square foot solar panel array that will generate 850kW of electricity.  Almost half of the roof will be covered with solar panels allowing it to be a net-zero electricity facility, meaning it creates more energy than it consumes. There will even be a live dashboard that will display how much energy is being produced, and other information about the panels on the roof mounted in the facility."
[source](http://bsndenver.com/what-you-didnt-know-about-the-new-cu-facilities-part-1/). 
The climate control will be by evaportive coolers. These use 1/8th the power of air conditioning. They can be used in Boulder because of the area's low humidity. 

Edit- apparently there's a neighborhood in Boulder that is zero energy, from 2009
http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_13878645 




 You forgot [this girl] (http://i.imgur.com/SE2KeCb.gif) 




 I think redoing the west side is in discussion. They mentioned tearing down Balch Field house. I really hope they manage to keep the field house but I guess they won't need it if they can put a floor down in the practice facility for non-football events. Expanding the concourse on coors has also been in discussion, I don't see how they do that with the little room to expand outside.  




 And burn away the shame of another loss  




 How about free weed?  




 I thought I would try writing my own type of construction update as I pass by the facilities daily. 

Construction updates are all over /r/cfb so what makes this one unique? Green innovation. 
The solar panels on the indoor practice facility have started being placed. The skeleton of the structure is viewable on the [construction cam] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209458799). So why do solar panels matter? They matter because the [indoor practice facility](http://www.cusustainableexcellence.com/ipf.html), 110,000 square feet, will be the only self-sustaining indoor practice facility in the country. 

This isn't the first CU athletic facility to lead the nation in a green initiative, Folsom Field became the [first zero waste stadium in 2008] (http://www.colorado.edu/ecenter/zero-waste-football-games). This is all part of [Ralphie's Green Stampede] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=1549812) that consists of many eco-friendly initiatives to keep CU as one of the greenest and most innovative universities. 

The setting of CU on the edge of the Rocky Mountains is a constant reminder of why CU leads the way in building a more sustainable future.  The new facilities will also lead Colorado football into a brighter future, with sustained success to rival that of the 90's. After all, if you build it, they will come. Well, 3 people are coming so far....  




 Bless your heart  




 Seems like a lot of reps/sets. I'd suggest knocking off some of the high reps sets  




 Any suggestions for protein that's easy on the stomach? 




 I would rethink the reps. I do 5x5 and my weights go up 5lbs a week for bench and squat. I study exercise science and high weight with few reps will get your max strength higher while lower weight at high reps is more endurance. Its fast twitch vs slow twitch muscle fibers if your interested in checking it out  




 You don't look much bigger, part of being tall, but your shape has definitely improved. More of a chest and less of a gut. Size will come 




 Because you don't have birds chirping. Call me crazy but I hate birds, mostly because they have a nest outside my window so they wake me up at dawn  




 Hopefully in the next renovation... 




 Troughs. Sorry  




 We tried this last year, didn't help  




 Plus it can get below freezing in the mountains that time of year  




 Free tickets with purchase from dispensary  




 Just need California to legalize and over half the pac would be legal. 

Pac 12- conference of pothead champions  




 [moose] (http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28359296/moose-loose-boulder-police-scare-late-night-visitor)

Edit- apparently [this video] (https://m.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3amojj/house_cat_doesnt_give_a_shit_about_mountain_lion/)of a mountain lion and cat happened just outside of boulder  




 Give out weed? Have a weed garden? 
Honestly it's hard to get fans to show when you're surrounded by the rocky Mountains. Having night games would help  




 But........we have weed  




 TIL how it was made. 
It would be very odd if a candidate didn't use red white and blue. Obama's campaign stood out because he was a younger guy with great marketing  




 I was referring more to the red white and blue self portraits, the hope and change. Obama's campaign was extremely visual  




 So the conservative version of  think progress? 




 Obama knew this 
Edit- referring to the red white and blue street art posters  




 Home life does more to education than education itself  




 Poor poor liberal victim. Here have some hope and change.  




 But why male models? 
Ben stiller forgot the line and was restarting the scene. It worked well  




 Leaving the hospital with the failed explosion  




 Obesity has a very simple fix, put down the fork. 
However people with obesity have reasons for over eating usually associated with lack of discipline/confidence so food because emotional support  




 Ah memories. I made it to every pearl st bar that night, with a drink at each, after starting at half fast. 

If CU starts out 5-0 with a win against Oregon, pearl st will have a real stampede  




 It's simple, we kill the batman. 

But seriously you have to find the root cause, no its  not movies or video games, and fix that. I don't know enough to know that cause  




 http://www.amazon.com/MANGROOMER-Flushable-Personal-Engineered-Executive/dp/B0090N3SKM 




 As someone in Colorado, weed.  




 That's a day's worth of food for me 




 Only half price for the first 12 months. Can't reuse edu emails either  




 I saw that shower thought too 




 Apparently they don't include new jerseys  




 Camo can be bought at many places  




 [Ironically he writes gang rape erotica] (http://nypost.com/2015/06/05/bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy-essay-reveals-left-wing-hypocrisy/)

I don't think the erotica represents his personal views, but it's kinda ironic  




 It's as if Huffington post twisted his words!

"The placement of a Confederate flag on the Capitol grounds is a state issue and I fully expect the leaders of South Carolina to debate this but the conversation should wait until after the families have had a chance to bury and mourn their loved ones," Walker said in a statement to BuzzFeed last week. 
 




 If you actually read the misleading article, he said he trust South Carolina to handle it, he never said he was for the flag.  




 [Just like Clinton] (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/) 




 Very misleading title. He never said he supports it. He called for it to be taken down years ago, then recently said he trusts South Carolina will handle it. 

"The placement of a Confederate flag on the Capitol grounds is a state issue and I fully expect the leaders of South Carolina to debate this but the conversation should wait until after the families have had a chance to bury and mourn their loved ones," Walker said in a statement to BuzzFeed last week. 
 




 Fixing our violent culture would decrease gun deaths, stabbing, assualts, and any other way you harm someone  









 Like when you want to return an item to Amazon but they refund you and say don't bother returning it. How do they do that? Amazing  




 Being a liberal doesn't make you a hippie, but being a hippie makes it near certain you're a liberal. Close enough?  




 Except I can leave my house and comeback with a replacement phone 30min later. Other companies require you send it in  




 That customer service though  




 1% of the world consumes 99% of the world's food  




 And the majority of preventable illnesses are obesity related. The same conditions are the top costs in healthcare.  




 Except they have a bowl already 




 I mean, they worked. 
If they actually got made into swim trunks I'd buy a pair  




 Toss up between the new uniforms and new facilities  




 Our pac bro will beat you and we're going to beat you next year with another miracle in Michigan  




 11am- wake up still hungover from watching the game at 11pm mountain against Hawaii the Thursday before. 

1130am start watching whatever games are on. 

9pm go to the bars. 

1159pm get a drink thrown in my face  




 Were spending record amounts of money per student and getting poor results. Money isn't the problem. It's students who don't care because of shitty home lives, teachers (some not all) that get lazy after getting tenure.  




 NRA fights that data collection because the data will show how much shootings occur. However that data won't show the reason behind it. The reason being the US is a violent country. Guns aren't the problem, society is.  




 [were just a violent country] (http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2012/07/20/america-is-a-violent-country/). Fix the violence, and gun deaths will go down. If you think violence will decrease without guns you are mistaken. The US still has an above average rate of stabbing and bare hand assualts when compared to other countries  









 I'm interested in how that would work. Do you have more info? 

Edit- downvoted for being interested and wanting to learn something, never change /r/politics  









 I don't understand what you're getting at  




 Jeb Bush actually took down the flag in Florida back in 2000.  




 Changing US culture to not be as violent would be better than gun control. Most other first world countries aren't near as violent at the US.

 All 4 of those electoral votes from a state that is basically Vermont.  




 Free college and health care wasn't delusional enough? 
Bring on the downvotes.  




 If only he had his own campaign subreddit. Oh wait... 




 That requires people actually watch it 




 Like the undecided voters in Family Guy  




 It would get upvoted if Trump said it because reddit loves to laugh at him  




 Genetic conditions are one thing... 




 1,000 years from now historians can just look at videos of the past, assuming they don't fuck up and lose the ancient technology of mp4 etc 




 I would like to reinforce that it's the insurance companies that screw up costs, not the hospital or clinic. The purpose of insurance is to collect as much money while paying out as little as possible. The hospital will charge $100 for an advil pill but will only get $10. That's why bills are so high, it's a negotiation game.  




 The person pays more, but the hospital gets paid less. They hospital charges an uninsured person less than an insured person because they can actually get money from the insured. 
The ambulance service I works for only sees payment on 30% of patients. That means 70% of our patient won't pay a cent, including their insurance or lack of.  




 [Well 21% of the health costs could be fixed if people ate better and exercised] (http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2012/04/obesity-accounts-21-percent-medical-care-costs).
It's no coincidence that the most obese country pays the most for healthcare.  




 My university had experiments on board. Good thing we still have another one orbiting Mars  




 I think you left out the part about cars  




 I reported another post for the same violation and the mod claimed the source post wouldn't load for him. It was the official Sanders web page.  




 That was my thought. If by some tiny chance the guy recognized his own car then mission accomplished 




 Does this count as a witch hunt? 
Obviously not in favor of littering but reddit rules are rules  




 [Well this is awkward] (http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/26/rand-paul-gets-highest-marks-marijuana-policy-proj/) 




 Title rule violation, mods either need to enforce the rule or get rid of it instead of being selective based on their opinion  




 Only if lanes are clear on the sides. Good luck doing that in a traffic jam  




 Well there would be a car blocking the way... 




 Colorado Springs University  




 /r/tall 




 Fixed 




 You brought up football. 

Colorado had one bad year after getting snubbed one year, making the tournament the next 3, including a pac 12 tournament title.  




 Yeah it must be great critiquing others when your school has zero chance of ever making playoffs being in the MWC and all. Especially when you go 1-7 in conference.

4th recruit for CU so far

[247sports] (http://247sports.com/Recruitment/Akil-Jones-87153/RecruitInterests)

Other offers from Wyoming, Utah State, San Diego St 

 




 Well you used the old one in the post  




 Says the mountain west school. Talk to me when you have 30 national championships  




 Alien blue shows flair  




 Someone didn't hear about our [new unis] (http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5526826ee4b0788926c507cf/55443953e4b0e11ffa878af3/55538015e4b03971c5bae4b2/1431535638051/2.jpg) 




 Because Colorado plays at Hawaii they are bowl eligible at 6-7. There's a couple other things that would have to fall in place but odds would be favorable for Colorado. Plus Colorado SOS is crazy  




 Like all $10-$20 of tax payer money? You should she the shit that goes on in Washington  




 Imagine how different this would be if she was shot  




 A popular phrase used to show disapproval of the current US president, specifically used here about the Infringement of constitutional rights by some states  




 Thanks Obama!
 (yes I know he had nothing to do with it) 




 I'll look out for that, my browser defaults to https  




 Unless the people change to a "bad" view. 
Like hypothetically people decided they were against gay marriage and then Obama tries to ban it. 
 




 Damn that post filter isn't catching much  




 Probably SNL Bush 




 But it also shows how the politician can be swayed  




 I'm not Republican  




 Also a lot of social media and technology has changed in the last 7 years. Bush never had the chance to make a BuzzFeedVideo  




 It had a lot to do with voters supporting it 




 So that's the change he was talking about in his campaign.... 




 So mods, this violates the new title rules because it uses title AND quote. I guess it stays because Sanders, fuck off mods  














 4-0 OOC, beat Oregon, USC, UCLA. Win the bowl game. End season 8-6 




 The thousands of posts from people wanting to take advantage and get fake Internet points wasn't enough?  




 I'd say more important  




 Or hopping on the karma train  




 [he's an amazing writer too] (http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/05/29/can-you-tell-if-these-passages-are-from-bernie-sanders-weird-1972-short-story-or-fifty-shades-of-grey/) 




 Right around the same time he wrote gang rape erotica 




 Or the right wall will be the inside wall of a circle  




 See the side bar 




 Well you got it, just keep in mind they close the roads for the fireworks so you'll have to hike  




 Freedomest?

Well the US didn't get any smarter  




 Take advantage of all the people rushing to get married = $$$$ 














 Roughly 15 lbs? About a pound a week for us Americans.  




 There's also stuff to open blood vessels and vitamin b. I use preworkout and lift noticeably better.  




 Fellow tall, I've put on 30lbs in 6 months. A good amount is fat but I was so skinny I didn't care. I'm not even skinny fat so the weight looks good. Just lift a lot and eat a lot, worry about muscle tone later unless you get a huge gut  




 What are you asking? 




 Brace yourselves for all the posts "X states their thoughts of the legalization".  




 And this will be the biggest post in reddit history  




 Sorry, my brain is filled with very small rocks  




 Braces yourselves for the biggest post in /r/politics history  




 Maybe wedding ceremony costs will increase initially due to demand? I'm just spit balling here 




 Can't we just celebrate this without talking politics? 




 Anything on if private places that host weddings are allowed to turn a gay couple down? That's the next big thing to tackle  




 I had no idea this was even going on in the court. That language is so official yet so moving  




 Says Walmart on the store  




 Man its sad no one on this sub cares. I'd say we should have /R/Wisconsinpolitics but politics makes the majority of content here. 
Let's go Decker and Frank!  




 They aren't air force  




 Fall of Colorado  




 North-Oregon,Stanford,Cal 

South- USC, Arizona, Utah 

Games circled- Oregon, Cal, USC  




 Air Force, Colorado, CSU, GT. 
You can't do that. The Colorado teams hare each other, GT hates CU  




 glad you guys could get over the clipping call, unlike someone.... 




 3 




 Utah. 
Ideal pac south would be Colorado, Utah, UCLA, ASU, USC, Arizona  




 Well an Arizona player is now playing with Dinwiddie in Detroit  




 [how dare you] (https://twitter.com/sportsnation/status/614232190189240324) 




 If Dinwiddie didn't get hurt, that year would have been awesome between Colorado and Arizona  




 I'm just coming from back in to talk about Stanley Johnson joining Dinwiddie in Detroit  




 I think the glory days are done already. Tad didn't take advantage of the success when it comes to recruiting. Probably barely .500 this season  




 [Just let me know how many times you hear his name] (http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZpAVEHHTz9s) 




 Yeah, Colorado doesn't even like him. But losing him isn't helping the team.  




 And cross country  









 Man you guys love to hate on him, you do realize no CU fans were happy he said that right? 
1/12 64-63 CU
3/12 53-51 CU wins pac tournament 
1/13 83-92 AZ in OT, you know damn well there wasn't enough evidence to overturn Chen's buzzer beater 
2/13 71-58 CU, RedemChen, the Valentines Day Massacre.  




 I used muscle milk a few years ago and stopped after a couple months. Too much sugar, it's basically an over marketed halfway decent protein  




 Football has shown more fight than basketball. I don't know how they show their faces after the game against Seattle. No excuse for losing that tournament  









 Are we a football school again?  




 How convenient it happened the year we don't go to the desert. Conspiracy theory- XJ didn't want to leave CU without a win at Arizona 

Plus Colorado died with Dinwiddie ACL  




 Well I believe he gets another year of eligibility, might be good in the long run since our recruiting sucks right now  









 Now put it in the oven and have apple chips  




 YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TIED UNC AND THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS DISCUSSION! IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT  




 How many Courics?  




 Well when you're high up you have potentially hundreds of people gunning for your job. Fuck up and they bring the next guy in.  




 Great example of why the schools don't need more money, they need to manage it better. My high school had less money than the area's public schools but students did better because of home life, discipline, and teachers that cared.  




 Well to be fair a big reason why inner city schools perform poorly is lack of discipline.  




 Well doctors already have performance checks, just in different ways. They retake the board exams every few years, those are fucking difficult. Doctors get sued and have lawyers evaluating everything looking for slip ups. If you fuck up, your patient gets worse or dies.  




 Those tangles  




 So this dude just runs out of a store with his arms full of crab legs while yelling fuck her right in the pussy and the woman working the store cries rape  




 I can neither confirm or deny buying beer for some of the linemen 




 6-7, then win the bowl game  




 Score on the first play of the 5th down series. Then GT would stop bitching even though the voters new all about the 5th down and chose Colorado anyways. They only won their poll by one troll vote 




 Or you know, a play that doesn't result in a tie for GT-UNC.  




 USC. It's a Friday night blackout game on ESPN.  




 YOU'RE JUST MAD WE LEFT  




 GAME THREADS AFTER DARK, COLORADO AT HAWAII 11PM MOUNTAIN  




 [can I get some of those recruits?] (http://cdn.meme.am/instances/58868050.jpg) 




 Biggest College stadium in a 500 mile radius, a live buffalo running around the field, you can legally get high before the game, the most scenic area in College football, and a [rooftop area] (http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wrk-ut5oUDc) WITH BEER overlooking the field with the Flatirons background

 AT LEAST THEY CAN'T BE CHARGED WITH POSSESION  




 He doesn't need help, it's Madison.  




 Can here we see competition doing its job in the market  




 Because they game is in Hawaii, and on a Thursday. So they have it when they finish class. It's stupid 




 IT'S ONLY 1030 HERE 




 This offer brought to you by New Belgium Stadium  




 Well CSU will have a shiny new stadium 




 First they confuse us, then they shall attack  




 Colorado beats Arizona at home  




 Nov 13 (USC) will be a long night if we win, guessing it'll be the blackout game since it's 7pm on ESPN  




 Let me know what you find, my interest has peaked  




 Well we could take a few billion from the defense budget.  




 Colorado  




 Cut the budget in available areas.  




 I'll have class the next day, but only one.... 




 According to a projection from the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent of Americans will pay 45.7 percent of the individual income taxes in 2014up from 43 percent in 2013 and 40 percent in 2012 (the oldest period available).

http://www.cnbc.com/id/102581780 




 3) the game starts at 11pm Mountain

 But a handful of millionaires can provide the government with money to operate  
























 No, just pay more attention to who you vote for beyond the president.  




 You over estimate the influence the governor has on jobs  




 Or they could go to the Sanders subreddit  




 What if it brings the state government profit?  




 What if I told you the other 2/3 of government would still be corrupt?  




 Or people could vote for the person they want, you know, the way democracy is set up to work. If you don't vote because you don't think your person will win, you're a terrible American  




 They're so mature that they don't read beyond titles and circle jerk sanders  




 Where's your wife titsmcgeee?  




 One of the best convo breakers I've seen on reddit  




 They want schools with large research budgets so they can collaborate. Colorado has a study with Wisconsin on why kids are dropping out of STEM. I've seen many recent studies at Colorado with Stanford and USC  




 Understood and I frequent the new section. At the same time why are many posts needed about the same thing? It discourages any diversity. If people want to talk about sanders crowd on multiple posts then there can go to the Sanders subreddit  




 OK I change it, $30 if he wins, $10 if he loses  




 No we don't.  




 I'm speaking relative to Wisconsin. If there was as much liberal trend as people think, walker wouldn't have been voted in three times. This was held in Madison, one of the country's most liberal cities. Unless you lived under a rock you heard about the protests in Madison when walker broke up unions. Walker survived still. One city does not represent an entire state.  




 Milwaukee will never be conservative. Simply said, that's where liberal voters live  




 But he went to Denver instead of Boulder. CU'S arena fits 10,000 people, he should've gone there. I saw Obama speak there a few years ago  




 His plans are pretty general too. 




 So what? Why do you need more than one post saying he had a big crowd  




 It was coincidence that it's gameday countdown tweet today  




 [He won't win] (http://www.businessinsider.com/can-bernie-sanders-beat-hillary-clinton-2015-7).
Before I get downvoted to the depths of hell, who wants to place a wager? If Sanders wins the primary, I'll donate $25 (I'm a broke college student and Sanders likes small donations) to his campaign. If he doesn't make it, $25 will be donated to the GOP that wins the primary by whoever takes me up on this. 

Edit- wow I would've expected someone to take me up on this by now. I guess Sanders supporters aren't as confident as they appear  









 I'm already subscribed, but it goes by the name /r/politics  









 Calling on the mods to do some regulation. All the top posts are about the crowd. Do we really need that many posts to tell us sanders had a big crowd? It's spamming, it's karma whoring, it's unnecessary.  




 Keep in mind this state elected Walker twice and he survived a recall. This crowd doesn't mean much  




 The top 4 posts on the sub are the same exact thing, sanders got a big crowd. Do we really need that many posts? Quit spamming

 At 62-22 CSU will always be little bro  




 We have caves and mines. 




 They can have the Bomber Game. Air Force drops bombs, New Mexico is where bombs are set off  




 Well we have plenty of one popular plant. 
Also high altitude = better skiing. This season ran October to June  




 Attendance has been bad and Colorado needs more home games since some years they only have 4 home conference games.  




 That's the excuse. When CU was snubbed they lost in the semis of the NIT, then won the pac tournament the following year so they couldn't be snubbed again 




 Well the showdown is no longer. CSU won't agree to a 2-1 series and so CU has scheduled TCU, Nebraska, Texas A M  




 We have UW and WSU, Oregon and OSU, Arizona and ASU. There's a trend  




 The bitched about being left out and lost the first NIT round

 Pretty sure king of the mountain would consist of CU, CSU, Utah, Utah State, BYU, Wyoming

 Why do you care? You're moving to the G5 




 No. Utah St and Colorado St to big 12.  




 In some areas, I'm just surprised it wasn't mentioned as criteria  




 Nothing about academics? 
I think they were generous on basketball. CSU lost the best players from last year if I remember correctly and that year was an outlier. They complain about being snubbed and then lose in the first NIT round. That's just poor attitude. Colorado was snubbed a few years ago then  lost in the NIT semis. To prevent being snubbed they won the pac tournament the following year. 
Geography gave me a laugh. Yes Colorado boarders a big 12 state and used to be a big 12 state, but it's not any easy drive. It's 8 hours of boring flat land from Kansas. I think CU BIG 12 history is the only reason geography was scored so high.  




 Cu and CSU haven't been doing well with the neutral site series and it's ending in a few years, ending the rivalry

 You'd like Boulder. They're converting entire traffic lanes into bike lanes.

 I gained weight  




 At the bar a guy kept bumping into me pretty hard. I know accidental bumps happen in crowds but it was more than that. I tell him "hey can you try not to bump into me so much". There's a girl there he's hitting on that I never even looked at. He decides to get all tough with words and starting to shove. Looks over at his friend who then comes over. These guys are around 5' 10". I laugh and turn to my friends. 
6'3", 6'6", 6' 8". The 6'8" guy is easily 250lbs. The guy backed off when he realized who I was with.

 You'd think Colorado would be better with a coach and player on this team  




 I never heard about the tournament until this year, perhaps someone could explain it more. Colorado has an alumni team, games start July 10th and Colorado plays July 11th. Games are live streamed with the final 17 being shown on ESPN U, and the last 3 games on ESPN.
Colorado roster includes Beau Gamble, Jeremy Adams, Sabatino Chen, to name a few. 
Winning team gets $1,000,000 and registered fans get prizes ranging from a t-shirt to $5,000.

 They also had a winning record in a major city with a less active population  




 "In place of seven tax brackets, there would be one (with a generous standard deduction for the first $50,000 of income). In place of hundreds of credits, deductions and other loopholes, there would be only a handful."

 You under estimate the amount of people that go to the ER and don't pay. Plus, the majority of cases in the ER could be seen by primary care or urgent care instead

 It was, I helped others make the connection  




 Hawaii is a few hours behind and can't play the game until after class gets out  




 You may have missed what I was referring to. In the 4th CU recruit post a Nebraska site had listed CSU as being in the springs. So CSU is now Colorado Springs University  




 I don't think consent should be required if there is reason for search. Does a guy match the description of one from a theft? Search for the item. Random stop and search should be consent based but appropriate suspicion should be enough to base a search on.

 Colorado Springs University deserves a few votes since they also have Air Force Academy in town  




 Take 20% off of the per capita and it's only 1,000 more than Norway. That 20% doesn't include cardiovascular disease which can be attributed to lifestyle choices.

 Burners for the hoes 




 That is correct but we're comparing to more developed countries. Also the rate is increasing in the US and it's predicted that 3/4 of Americans will be overweight or obese in the next 5 years. Something so easily fixed by people fixing themselves has taken over the country.

 Colorado should have never joined the pac 12  




 Colorado basketball has a ridiculous home court advantage, likely because you don't have stops in play. 0.690 all time, 90% under coach Boyle  




 In our case, what are they doing Wed before the 11pm mountain time game Thursday?  




 Similar note I Think CU has the highest elevation of p5 teams at 5,360ft. Denver Broncos are highest in the NFL and where 2/3 longest field goals have occurred  









 Too much work, just like exercise

 And American men are sent to other sports like American football, basketball, and baseball.  




 Really depends on height also. I can gain 1 pound of muscle a week.

 Record bench of 250 after starting at 185 a few months ago. 
Record weight of 180. I never weighed more than 170 and was 155 back in March. 
Friends I hadn't seen in months noticed my bulk, talking to girls at the bar has never been easier  




 Unpopular thought here. When you're really skinny your BF is also low. Gain muscle and BF. Who cares if you have fat as long as it's not a gut? Cut when you get to a good size. I've gained half fat half muscle but I still look better and most importantly I'm stronger

Only 23 percent had a documented psychiatric history of any kindwhich means three out of four did not.] (http://www.psmag.com/health-and-behavior/actually-know-connections-mental-illness-mass-shootings-gun-violence-83103).

 Who would have expected the poor who couldn't afford insurance would be sicker? I bet obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease make up a huge chunk of the "unexpected"  




 I'd like to see the numbers. How much they got in fees, how much they paid to healthcare, how much was administrative costs.  




 It says he wants to ban semi-automatic weapons but the article doesn't say anything about fully automatic. Shouldn't it be the other way around? I appreciate that he recognizes one 0.1% of gun owners use it for crime but his stances seem inconsistent  














 Except most institutions are constantly barely getting by. Good luck taxing organizations with no money.

 So the tax makes money based on the amount of trade and he wants that trade to decrease which would give him less money than predicted? That makes no sense

 If I'm doing discontinued teams then I'll do Marquette. The MU and UW combo would make heads roll  




 Spring football/basketball? 




 Yeah I saw that, it's for frats  




 Lurker making a post, forgive me if I missed answers to this. I played some lacrosse in high school, now finishing school in Boulder after deciding against the CU club team because of time restraints. I've been itching to get back into play and have come across some boulder leagues. I was wondering if anyone here plays in them and has recommendations. I'm not sure what gear I have left from high school but I know I'll need a new stick and helmet.  




 I've been on that sub a few times, they love Colorado. I played years ago but didn't have the time for our club team. There's a boulder league I'm looking at but I wish they would do intramural  




 Yeah our men's club could easily make the jump. I'm not saying they would be an immediate power house, but they could compete. They won nationals in 2014, lost in the final last season. Women's moved to d1 via title ix and do decently but were a shitty club team beforehand. We have everything in place for it to happen, they just need to navigate title ix restrictions. A rivalry would easily form between CU and DU. 

The Denver outlaws pro team won a title recently, DU won ncaa, Colorado and CSU have recent club titles, ncaa regional was in Denver, world games were here last year. It's getting big in Colorado  




 Game 3 this year, Sept 19, 5pm at mile high  




 Colorado won nationals in 2014. They had two plays on ESPN top 10 but I can't find the video now  




 [Here's ticket info] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml? DB_OEM_ID=600 ATCLID=209140439). It looks like Oregon is family weekend so that's another way tickets will be harder to get. You should look into mini packs. It's $77 for 3 games but you could get better seats if you pay a bit more money. I highly recommend going to the Rocky Mountain Showdown. It isn't a huge crowd but there is plenty of hate to go around, especially with recent years. 




 We did, and Cross Country  




 What time zone? 
East Coast people can enjoy a 1am match up of Colorado at Hawaii on what's technically a Friday morning  




 What is the most popular spring sport at your school? 
Colorado has no popular spring sport but hopefully lacrosse if it gets added like Girls  lacrosse did  




 University of Denver doesn't even have a team. Their lacrosse though, I would go nuts if CU made a d1 team half that good  




 Are you in the Boulder area? Those tickets will be "harder" to come by. I say harder because season ticket holders and students won't be giving up their tickets, USC has a huge alumni base in Colorado, and Oregon has random fans everywhere. 
Best advice, don't get tickets in the visitors area, those are the worst seats in the stadium. I would just go to the Folsom box office web page and buy tickets before season starts. Sure you could get some scalped tickets a few days before the game but the could be more expensive.  




 I haven't seen any Nebraska or CSU attire on tours. I'll see the occasional CSU shirt and people will look at them funny but that's it. 
For some reason people think it'd 100% OK to never wear CU gear but always wear USC/UCLA. Even when the team comes to town they'll wear that to games. I don't give a shit that you're from LA and your dad is the dean of X California schools, you're at CU now  




 That's just not a person you want at the school if they were serious. Not because of being a rival fan but total disrespect of an academic institution that's taking time to consider you  




 As if I needed another reason to hate Ohio State fans  




 It would be too easy

 I feel for FSU fans, a few kids with attitude don't reflect the team.  




 Maybe they'll go the way of Colorado following our accusations of the early 2000s 









 I used to fly Frontier a dozen times a year before the most recent buyout. I asked at the counter if there were "stretch" seats left before each flight. Roughly half the time I was upgraded for free 




 Wipes  




 Utah isn't much of a trap, they have good odds of besting Oregon 




 Nichols St  




 Colorado is hosting girls volleyball, soccer, lacrosse, and cheer camps this week. As a college senior, those girls make me feel old even though they are mostly high school

 It helps when you don't have a pro team  




 Shares and views  




 People want to work less for more pay? Who would have thought?! 




 The millions of Facebook mom's that actually believe them  




 Milwaukee is one of the poorest cities with one of the worst education systems. This was true long before walker became governor. The twin cities were not at the level of Milwaukee.  









 Well, Minnesota doesn't have to deal with the poverty of Milwaukee  




 This will never get upvoted because the Sanders brigade makes sure bad press never surfaces  




 It would need to be a low fee otherwise traders will find ways around it

 She's going to lose a lot of voters by fighting the NRA. Let's fight poverty, poor education, and bad home lives (the cause of violence) instead of people who want to responsibly handle guns.  




 I think it's because people associate silver with a shiny metallic finish  




 I'll call so you can work 




 Yes  




 And now we lose  




 I'd argue last year's game against Utah. We were so damn close and it would have been our only conference win 









 That's half useful, thanks  




 Depends how he plays post injury  




 Our rival picked GT? No way!  









 Results 
http://bsndenver.com/poll-results-what-uniforms-do-buffs-fans-want-to-see/ 




 Well it's OOC against a g5, you tell me 




 National champions but only by 1 vote in the poll and not even close in the other  









 What would you say it is you do here? 




 [Had it looked like this, I wouldn't argue] (https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2895502/kickerblammo.0.gif) 




 I love it. Lots of BS but I'm not in a cubicle, I work with my hands, and get to see some crazy cool stuff  




 To be very general, I work in healthcare  




 Let's get you a promotion  




 Similar to you I'm 6 4 and gained 30 lbs to hit 180, I look nothing like your pictures though  




 Was 6 4 and 150. Up to 180 now, original goal was 190 but now I want to break 200 




 Worked 7am to 7am yesterday.  




 I work 48 hours straight with nothing saying I get to sleep.  




 I can't tell what happened on these potatoe cameras  




 In the words of Michael Scott, keep it simple stupid  




 [I don't see the issue] (http://bsndenver.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CUvid016.jpg) 




 I think we've paid out debts. Also 2/5 recruits so far are from Georgia  




 And here we have the first person without GT or CU flair, however with UGA flair I can't say you're unbiased  




 There is no true help, this argument will go on FOR CENTURIES!!!! 




 I'd like to see how teams for both conferences voted  




 Adding another comment for [this interesting ranking] (http://www.tiptop25.com/fixing1990.html) 




 Ohio State lost to VT, beat Oregon and FSU pretty bad. This would all be solved if Colorado played GT in the bowl game.... 




 Do votes get casted one at a time? That seems like a horrible way of doing it  




 Playing in Nebraska is more than 3 points  




 Completely unbiased here. 
The Nebraska common opponent doesn't work here. CU played in Lincoln, GT played neutral field. 
I'll keep my overall argument simple, all voters knew about the 5th down and clipping call. That is the biggest arguments against Colorado but don't hold much ground when voters knew about it. Colorado only lost the coaches poll by 1 vote. They won the AP by very many votes. Colorado had a harder SOS as many other people here will discuss. If we emphasize conference play then Colorado wins at a perfect record where as GT tied North Carolina. 

Edit- for SOS Colorado played 7 rated opponents to GT's 3.  




 Neutral for GT 
At Nebraska for Colorado. 
Not a good comparison, going off that any team that beat VT last season is better than Ohio State  




 I knew this day was coming, it's been an honor off seasoning with you.  




 Sorry about the fireworks, side question for you though, have you been following the trial?  




 Issue is this isn't a good comparison. You comparing average wage to elite schools. Better comparison is average wage to average in state tuition. Numbers will still show a huge increase in tuition without increase in wage  









 Ironically, many people commenting on this are at work.  




 You act like dems don't fast track stuff too, that's politics 




 Many teams share, that's low on priorities  




 Some of the harassment could be considered boys will be boys type stuff  




 Lacrosse  




 Lacrosse will gain a lot of those players since it's not as much contact  




 Isn't that in New York?  




 Well it's part of my job to ask every female of fertile age if they could be pregnant...... 
It's always fun asking the 80 year old woman as  a joke  




 I know all about the allegations. Sex and alcohol got recruits during that time. Was it the right thing to do? No. I'm tracing it all back to the source which is her. No trial was ever held against any of the players, Barnett even requested names. No other females pressed charges. There's nothing saying that they were innocent or guilty. Either way, no Katie, no accusations.  




 [this article explains it pretty well] (http://www.denverpost.com/colleges/ci_27041416/cu-buffs-football-program-tries-dig-out-deep) 




 Georgia Tech didn't join the pac so now CU And GT can't have an annual rivalry game where the winter gets both the AP and Coaches poll trophies from 1990  




 It's a shitty situation that has screwed Colorado over for nearly two decades, that's why she's the biggest mistake they made  




 It's applies to them whenever they're around the team, it's not just the physicality that's fueled by hormones, it's how guys act.  




 Exactly, Barnett told her in the 2nd year that she would have to compete for a spot and she didn't even tryout again. No one respected her because she was a bad player and didn't even try hard  




 She wasn't even good, no clue why she was even on the team. She never played a game. 
Having a female in a sport fueled by testosterone is not going to work, especially back then.  




 No. Colorado is way better off in the pac. Have you heard how fucked the big 12 is? The pac south is the hardest division in college football. Put Colorado in the north and they go 500. Did you watch any games last season? We completely out gained ASU, multiple overtime against Cal, would have won against UCLA if sefo spiked the ball at the end of the first half but instead lost in over time. We have 4-5 games decided by one possession. 
Can't wait to visit the big house next season, we won't even need a miracle this time.  




 Having a female kicker.
She's not on the team, no accusations of harassment. No crackdown by the administration on recruiting rules. Colorado still relevant. 

Edit- anyone downvoting is lying if they think a female football player would benefit the team.

 Welcome to the PAC 




 Bikers should always be cautious regardless of who's in the right because getting hit by a car hurts. 
Most bikers I see at night have no lighting or reflective gear. Cops don't enforce the law of needing lights. 
I don't hate bikers although it's probably coming off that way, I just don't think this solution will work unless you get a huge amount of drivers to start biking.  




 I found it interesting the Bucks' worth doubled after going from worst team to NBA team, regardless of the conspiracy theory listed in the article. 
Milwaukee and Wisconsin have a choice, build a new stadium to keep the bucks, possibly get an NHL team, and modernize Milwaukee. Or let the bucks leave and NBA owners profit off the $1 billion deal and lose and Milwaukee Bucks related revenue. The revenue will increase greatly over the next few years. The bucks have a lot of young talent. They can sustain success and get the city excited about something.  









 [this shit] (http://youtu.be/JQmNYPOgx40) 




 Just sibling banter here  




 [depends, do you support the military?] (http://youtube.com/watch?v=wRRsXxE1KVY) 









 Meanwhile the bucks have playoff team with an average age in the mid 20s. 
NHL is considering Milwaukee for an NHL team. 
A new stadium would do nothing but good for Milwaukee. Everyone is way too focused on the bucks. It's ok to fund a baseball stadium for a shitty team but funding a facility for diverse entertainment is a no go. There's a reason Milwaukee and Wisconsin are behind, everyone is stuck in the past and resistant to any modernization  




 Voat  




 Blame the skyrocketing population  




 Follow sports writers/teams as they post score updates, article links, and short thoughts  




 Same reason you can't change other games to ref error, shit happens  




 Wisconsin paid $290 million for Miller Park, a place that only hosts baseball. New stadium for the bucks hosts way more events with less state funds. 
How are the brewers these days?  









 But a Miller Park tax is OK? How are the brewers now? Not near as good as the bucks.  




 Good for you. It's about more than the bucks. It opens the door for NHL to add a Milwaukee team, concert events, and overall entertainment. Milwaukee has nothing in the winter months and even summerfest is losing appeal. Milwaukee needs to modernize  




 And then goes any chance of Milwaukee getting an NHL team. You're stuck in  the past, Milwaukee needs new buildings in order to be appealing to anyone. It's a shit hole right now  




 Well that explains it 




 [you sure?] (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B6SsDTuIEAEpL02.jpg:large) 




 What are those?  




 Must be an old review for Colorado, they brought back beer gardens last year. This year we have a brand new rooftop terrace on top of the new addition. 
[Tickets to the rooftop sold out in hours] (http://bsndenver.com/around-the-herd-7715-shouting-from-the-rooftop/) 

I was hoping the review would be something more along the lines of it being hard to breathe, and not because of excitement 

Edit- not a one star review but I enjoyed this one 
"If you judge a stadium by how good the football team is, then Folsom Field will not be the place for you."  




 Auburn is compensating for something  




 Let's see how welcoming you are at week 3 




 Stolen from Mizzou and GT, sounds familiar  




 Pearl and Valmont sure. Colorado to pearl needs all lanes. Why not add a multi use path like broadway has and make it wider?  




 That doesn't mean they made the connection right away 




 That's Friday morning to you

 US is a violent society to begin with  




 No need for government funds if a donor keeps stepping up. Essentially makes it a charity that actually works

 It already has a new year of funding by private donations  









 Because people exist outside of the reddit bubble

The next championship review should be fun... 














 Broncos fan? 20 minutes north is Folsom Field and the Colorado Buffaloes. Best part is that no one can call you a bandwagon Fan!  




 So that Cal schools, the SEC, and ACC. That would actually be a good schedule assuming it fits through the Panama Canal or goes all the way around south America. They'd probably end up keeping it on the east coast because no one wants to travel west  




 "Michigan has offered Highlands Ranch (Colo.) Valor Christian 2017 dual-threat quarterback Dylan McCaffrey. Here's a quick look at the player."

So it's simple, Colorado beats Michigan next season and he takes his talents to Boulder

 I think you're being downvoted by how you're presenting info and also people who refuse to accept that more times than not, men are better athletes than women.

 Colorado plays 5 away games in conference play so they needed another home game. Plus mile high has been empty during the games, it's hard to justify playing there  




 2020 OOC- CSU, AF, Texas A M 
2022 OOC- AF, TCU, Minnesota  




 Well CSU, this is what happens when you don't play ball. Fuck Air Force! A pretty good rivalry coming back

 Pac games  




 Ah yes, state schools have so much profit. That's why were pending debt approval to update class rooms  




 Not when the state gives very little funding. Most of my university funding comes from federal research and tuition  




 Now you know why employers love interns  




 Put the corporations on a pedestal  




 45 hours * 4 weeks is 180. $1000/180 hours = $5.55/hour.
They definitely have no obligation to give you benefits for an internship (seen as temporary employment especially if it's a summer internship) and a below minimum wage pay. Are you sure you're numbers are right?  




 Said this the last time this was posted, many people commenting this are at work  




 My university cut full time positions for students because they couldn't afford to give them benefits  




 A company wants profit? No way? That's the fucking point of business.  




 I was saying on one person but I'm a crowd  




 If you look at the Wisconsin map here you will see many seats in Milwaukee area but very large areas in the north west. We're not talking about Florida  




 EMT here. Cops don't need medical training beyond first aid/CPR. They already fuck up the little medical training they have. Their job isn't to make medical judgement, that's our job. Just like why firefighters cut people out of cars, not cops, there's a places for everyone in the system. Mess with who does what and it's a disaster. 
There's literally nothing the cops could do for a seizure. Seizures require drugs that paramedics attend years of schooling in order to gain a license to give the drugs. Best case scenario for a seizure in a crowd- move patient out from the crowd if it is safe to do so, have Medics show up, Medics treat/transport
On a side note, if you witness seizure, time how long it is and move things out of the way so the person doesn't get hurt.  




 Mom probably charged at cops when she saw the daughter 




 Spray is also worthless in small spaces or crowds  




 Or that highly populated areas that vote democrat also don't have the most districts.  




 So no hope during recall or reelection?  




 Pretty crazy how big cities vote democrat and thus get those seats but rural/majority of state area isn't necessarily Democrat  




 Because a huge amount of those votes were from the Milwaukee area. Those people vote democrat. How many districts are there in Milwaukee area versus the rest of the state?
Edit- could it also be that not every democrat voted democrat? As in, do they base those numbers off of who got a vote or what the voter identified as? I know Democrats that voted Walker because they didn't like Tammy  




 Also what brought the program down... 




 People who still can't afford insurance now have less money to eat because of fines. 




 You're crazy to think he's made much of a difference in the middle east. The recession was part of the housing crash that was caused by people buying things they can't afford, not bush. 

The health has caused premiums to rise and people who can't afford Obama care are now paying fines.  




 CSU- Last year wasn't a fluke!  




 Did you watch Colorado Utah last year? We almost pulled it off  




 Colorado Utah. Basically anyone alive for those days is old or dead now.  




 No but improving home lives and getting parents involved in education will help  




 Keep a kitchen open and sell food. 




 So did Obama, where is he on his promises?  




 Well he did get elected twice and win a recall.  




 Because [increased spending on education doesn't increase performance] (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=967656)

Edit- downvoted for citing a study! Reddit at its finest  




 It's interesting everyone's picking those pac games. We should've have beat UCLA last season if sefo spiked the ball, OT against Cal, I think 500 yards against ASU which was more than them. I would say we win 1 of the WSU OSU games and one other 
You're also missing a game, we play 13

 Colorado plays 13 games because of the trip to Hawaii, let's say 7-6 




 That's a completely different thing... 




 So 2am is chug time?  




 Just beat mizzou and you win the east  




 That 1-12 worst case is exaggerated. 2-11 would be absolute worst case 
I agree with a 7-6 best case but it only takes 6 to make a bowl with Hawaii as an opponent

 You'll gain a couple inches but can't walk for a year. They cut and separate your bone, then fill the space with bone fragments and wait for bine to fill in.  




 5 meals a day instead of 3 




 Should've joined Jim at CU  




 Nebraska, Tennessee, Kansas  




 More sec pac OOC games and bowls would help  




 Confirmed- Colorado and Utah not rivals 
 




 Or you could you know...watch the interview  




 It has the video......you can see for yourself

 [Basically CNN decided to make drama] (http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/19/cnn-deliberately-misquotes-gov-scott-walker-video/) 




 Walker  who was traveling between campaign stops in Iowa  said that I think that this isnt an issue I need to be involved in. The bottom line is that Im going to stand up and work hard for every American, regardless of who they are, no matter where they come from, no matter their background. Im going to fight for people, no matter if they vote for me or not.

 Hijack the top comment with a link that [describes it well] (http://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/2015-strength-of-schedule/) 




 Just listed the ones I knew of  




 Not gonna lie, a factor when I was choosing a college was travel. One school required I take a plane with maybe a dozen rows and a 6ft ceiling. It wasn't a deciding factor, but it was on the cons list  




 Reddit is not your friend on this. Head to /r/conservative /r/politicaldiscussion and /r/neutralpolitics if you want any peace  




 Pay off that school debt somehow  




 I know this is not directly college football but with the recent ruling and discussion about ncaa football games coming back I thought this was interesting. Is it a loophole that ea sports could use or 2k could  make a game? I could see this effecting ncaa series  









 I really should have seen this coming  




 I used to fly Frontier a dozen times a year and ask the gate attendant if I could be upgraded to stretch seating. It worked about half the time. Depends who you get. I sometimes took a gamble and boarded last and just took a stretch seat and they never cared to say anything  









 No its not, the sub can also say "Fuck Walker" 




 Well that explains Obama  














 Walker literally just said Trump needs to apologize for the comments made about McCain 
"He needs to apologize to Senator McCain and all the other men and women who have worn the uniform," 




 Actually eating home cooked meals is cheaper than eating out. Being healthy is a matter of discipline. You could eat like shit but not become obese if you exercise  




 I don't know what my percentage is right now but I did gain a good amount of fat.  Don't have a gut or anything but I would like to get more definition  




 Does anyone know if the rooftop will be open to the public other than game times? I have bought game tickets yet so didn't buy a terrace ticket and they sold out. I'd really like to check it out and I know the have the tour at the end of the month you pay $40 for. 
Ideally they have it function as a bar/grill on weekends but I haven't seen anything about it  




 99 rose bowl, Wisconsin beat UCLA. I have never seen Colorado play in a bowl since I didn't become a fan until I became interested in attending back in 2010 




 Are you serious? There's no medical issue that causes obesity. You won't gain more than 10lbs from an underactive thyroid. Mental illness can cause over eating but thats about it. 90% of Diabetes cases are caused by poor diet  




 Were really good at making them 




 Veal and corn  




 The difference is FSU had a star player just get drafted after years of not being able to keep him disciplined. I'm suspended? Fuck it I'll just go on the sideline in my gear and no one will notice, right? He's gone and other players are filling the void of drama from stupid decisions  









 Great feeling when you get those plates. Feels even better when you add two plates  




 I'm guessing by the buff walk on the east side of the stadium  




 190 was my original goal but now I'm thinking 200. I'll probably do my first cut at 190 




 MSU  




 They just want people to see the work being put into our roads! /s 




 Stressor for teachers is the shitty kids and shitty parents that come along  




 This I can agree with 




 Um teachers only teach until college. College professors have at least a masters, mostly PhD, not some education degree they got over 5 drunken years of undergrad. Once in med school, it's doctors teaching doctors. Plus shitty teachers get to keep their jobs if they've been around long enough thanks to tenure  




 We know why we pay more? We're sicker. We're [sicker because of obesity] (http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/04/30/obesity-now-costs-americans-more-in-healthcare-costs-than-smoking/) 




 *taxes not included 
Plus you don't have to deal with the 99% preventable obesity and illnesses with higher rates due to obesity- cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, stoke, etc 




 Where's the reverse gif?  




 Did you not read the first line? 




 Stupid. Why? Doctors go to school 2-3 times as long and have 2-4 times the debt when they establish a career. 
Edit- plus doctors work 1/4 more  




 Act above a 30? You're in 




 The new lanes wouldn't make a difference in the accident you were in, glad you're OK though.  




 Gluck Gluck Gluck  




 You might be thinking of ARWU  




 I've been weighing myself before bed and if the weight is higher each day (yes I know food/water weight) then I'm on the right track  




 Well that's the point of insurance  




 You forget taxes  




 It'll extend north I believe. The bike lane is maybe a foot wider than it used to be and they added a 3 foot buffer zone.  




 Or having a heart attack from eating like shit and not exercising  




 Yeah I was keeping it simple. You could go as far as the manufacturer of surgical equipment and anesthesia  




 Because the hospital knows they get paid way less than they bill, that's why they bill so much 




 Hospitals bill that much because insurance pays 10% of what they bill. If insurance paid what was billed, the hospital would bill 10% of what they currently do. It's the insurance companies that screw everything up, not the hospitals 




 You can sue if they fire you for that  




 "Free". 




 Through my employer yes. If I don't need healthcare I don't pay a down payment  




 $1000 for having your skull opened, then someone with 10-16 years of education and training poking your brain isn't bad 
Edit- grammar  




 You can walk out of the ER without paying or giving them person info. If it's an emergency, they have to treat you.  




 Kind of. A lot of money that goes towards research and expansion would be lost. Taxes would increase so much even if I didn't need healthcare, I would be paying for it.  




 Guessing anti venom isn't cheap  




 There was no construction going on. The road was clear, lines painted, no construction staff around. The divider needs to be put up still but everything else was done  




 I wish I had gold to give you. The reddit circle jerk is ridiculous when it comes to US healthcare. The way to fix the system is to end the games. My ambulance service only gets payment from 30% of people transported, and most of that 30% doesn't pay the full cost  




 No that's the bill. What you pay is completely different  




 Don't worry about the fat unless you become skinny fat. You can cut later  




 The painting is nearly done and Folsom is now one lane for the new bike lane expansion. Discuss your thoughts and experiences. When I was on the road it was backed up from Canyon to the pearl pedestrian crossing. During 2-3 stop light cycles I saw one bike go by. I'm sure some of the congestion is due to people learning the new layout but it's a poor start.  




 My starting bench was high since I lifted in high school for football and lifted on and off the last few years.  




 If republican don't teach correct scientific fact, they can be fired or not hired. That argument doesn't hold much ground. Balancing is more important in areas like sociology, political science, and psychology. Only seeing the liberal side (or only seeing the republican side) doesn't encourage students to view things from both sides which is important in education.  




 First progress post. I lifted all of high school, on and off in college before getting religious about gaining in March

 [starting at 155] (http://imgur.com/Q1qxla9) and [Current at 180] (http://imgur.com/rUE6NZo)
6'4'' male, 22yo. 

Diet- eating anything I can, I haven't been counting calories. I stopped using protein shakes as I noticed I wouldn't eat much for a few hours after and started drinking 3 glasses of chocolate milk a day. For meat I have been doing chicken and pork, both are fairly cheap and I work them into various dishes. I'm aware I've probably gained a good amount of fat but I'm not worried about that yet since I was so underweight and don't have a gut yet. 

Lifting- squat and bench on 3x5, 3x3, 5-3-1 with warm up sets at bar and one plate each side. Curls, pull downs, single leg deadlift, calf raises, tricep extension, shrugs, lunges, all at 3x10.

main lifting improvements

bench- 180 max to 240 max

squat- 200 max to 250 max 





























 It won't be Obama level security.  




 Like it or not, money is one of the most important things in life. 




 So is every weekend when people come visit or drive through to estes.... 




 Just like every politician  




 There's reason behind this. There were issues with administration and faculty being too liberal, and they wanted to balance it out since teachers have a big impact on students views. [Only 6% of teachers were Republican in a survey] (http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_26042796/cu-survey-9-faculty-members-identify-republicans).   




 I thought you said throw spit, since that's something UGA fans do  




 2-1 against ranked,  Nebraska went 3-0-1, how do you figure Texas did better?  




 Because they're THE Ohio State University  




 I'm amazed that tech fans are way more upset about it than CU fans about GT claiming, especially when it's our only championship  




 Versus a 10-0-1 team or a 10-0 team?  




 Texas went 2-1 against ranked, Nebraska went 3-0-1 




 Says a lot coming from an Oregon fan  




 Michigan. Harbaugh can't save you!  




 Nebraska. Undefeated unlike the others. Why is 9-1 Ohio state even claiming it?  




 Georgia Tech. Bring both 1990 trophies to the game, winner gets both until the next meeting  




 The one that lot everything and has been trying to get back on their feet  




 I wasn't talking about just intelligence, I was talking about the lengthy planning  




 It's not smart, it was the time line. More said he was sane  




 He's not mentally ill. I followed the trial closely and he put way too much genius planning into the shooting. He had a cd player that played an hour of silence followed by loud music rigged to blow up when someone turned it off. The amount of detail and long term planning is enough to show it wasn't some insane act  




 [Here's all the info you would ever want about the trial, the shooting, and events leading up to] (http://www.denverpost.com/theater-shooting-trial) 




 [heres a tracker of counts] (http://www.denverpost.com/theater-shooting-trial/ci_28485365/verdict-aurora-theater-shooting) 




 I've been following the case since trial started. His act was very well planned and there is no way they will find him insane.  



















 His planning was too well done for insane  




 My weights (body and lifting) haven't increased in a few weeks, how do I get over the plateau? Obvious answer eat more and lift more?  




 "Win a pac game"  














 I CAN'T HEAR YOU  




 YOU WILL REMEMBER THEM! IN MIZZOURY  




 SEE WHAT HAPPENS CSU??? DON'T LISTEN TO BIG BROTHER AND YOU GETTING REPLACED BY OUR ADOPTED LITTLE BROTHER!!!! 




 Your welcome to see this yourself in the pac opener at Folsom. Although the Oregon section is probably closed to sold out  




 Restaurant will have 50. That's still 60ish people with jobs that could really use it in the area.  














 I know the overwhelming majority of CU and Boulder is liberal but I encourage people to go as long as they do so without interrupting. It's great CU was picked as a site with increasing political visit including Obama twice. This wasn't something that occurred in Boulder for a long time until his first visit.  









 See you on the field
