 YOU FUCKED MY CAT TOOOO!?!?!?

dude, I'd get checked if I were you, that cat is a fucking whore 




 I've only known one person IRL who likes it, which is my brother.

I'm not gonna take the time to describe my brother in great detail, but he is the second dumbest person I know. He's also the furthest thing from a 'nerd' 




 Hey, I remember that, I was there too! 




 dude, I don't even know... I'm gonna go watch TV 




 How about DigiDesign? 




 I'd eat the butter whole and then when he eats ME, i'll kill him slowly with high cholesterol!  




 Other than it not being funny, most people who are smart enough to use the internet don't like the show, so there's *that* 




 I would give myself omnipotence. I'm getting sick and tired by my lack of omnipotence 




 meh.

It's ok

 Probably not the day I was born 




 Because they like it rough ;) 




 I'd tell you, but I don't wanna be an associate to a violent murder and/or kidnapping

 What are your strengths? 




 I'd probably be a politician 




 Which n word?

narwhal?

neverland?

*nostril?* 




 Plain and simple: They wanted enough time to pass before mentioning Jon (Arin's post explaining WHY they didn't mention him was not a lie, despite Jon disagreeing with it)

They didn't want people flipping their shit over Jontron mentions or fighting over wanting the show to be what it was and not what it is. They wanted the show to move forward and not live in the past. Meanwhile, plenty of people, Jon and Nicole included, loved to troll you guys HARD on this sub

Finally enough time had passed when they felt like nobody would flip out over breaking the vow of silence. Dan had been there way longer and they reached a point where one of his serials was the longest running one. A perfect time to drop the silence. And NOBODY flipped out over it except for Conspiracy Grumps (it kind of killed it, TBH) Sure, plenty of people were shocked, happy, and glad to see it, but they didn't have a nerdgasm.

I don't think it was ever a breakup thing or a lost friendship. I think one guy just simply moved too far away to be involved. When your partner abandons you, you don't focus on the past, you focus on the present and doing your best to make a good product, which they did. Part of that required not mentioning Jon so that people didn't grow to loathe Dan or even Arin because it wasn't the way it started (And this sub particularly grew to loathe Arin) And they made the right choice because the show got exponentially better when Dan joined

 It's not about what THEY want... it's a matter of us showing our dominance and degrading them. Kinda like dogs marking their territory.

Only we give them baby gravy instead of peeing on them (though there are some folks who are into that as well)

 I make comedic films, CG animations, VFX shorts, and even a few songs coming up.

All of that primarily parodies video games, like my first song here;

 care to provide an example, as OP asked? 




 Arin cheated on him with Dan, so Jon ran away to NYC to become a model... I think he became quite successful:

 He does, but a lot of it might be fueled by the shitty part of this fanbase.

He's definitely the funniest though, hands down 




 All of them 




 I was right though. I doubted it was an alternate title 




 This one time my brother's digestive system wasn't working right and he shat out undigested spaghetti and sauce. I know this sounds fake but it's completely real. We were camping, he took a dump in the woods, then called us over to show it to us (it had little bits of digested fecal matter, but mostly looked like a dropped plate of pasta) My dad took him to the doctor the next day, I don't remember anything past that and it never happened again. 




 While they kinda feel like the same game at times, Majora's Mask for me. But only barely, primarily due to the creepiness of it and I never played it as much as I played OoT when I was a kid, yet I still remember it being more fun.

But OoT is a better icon in video-gaming and is the best representation of a perfect Zelda game 




 Not at all. Just a mediocre video made by Rocketjump. 




 funny stuff, man! 




 Fire. Literally fire everywhere, as far as the eye can see.

At least that's what FoxNews tells me 




 I'm saying that there is no original you. There are all these universes happening at the same time, without the presence of the others. They don't pop in and out of existence, they merely change when things happen in them. Sometimes those things don't happen in the others and over time the two will not be similar at all.

Even in other, similar universes, the person that looks, acts, and thinks like you isn't you. He doesn't share your atoms, your conscience, or your universe. He is a different person entirely

 like this:

ooxlxoo! 




 Well, what I mean isn't that the other universes are created when possibilities are presented, it's that those moments are where each universe starts to veer into its own, beginning with the most miniscule of differences. There wouldn't be an original 'you' just a different one.

A question I just thought of, though...

In an infinite universe, where mathematically speaking, anything that is possible or thinkable can and will eventually happen, then wouldn't THAT be in a way, predestination/fate? 




 That guy that did the thing. It mattered 




 and I'll make **this sound:**

 Posting this because my second daughter was born today and I immediately thought to myself "this is no time to make jokes.... save them for reddit :)  












































 God, what goes through someone's fucking mind when they see a video and decide to negatively comment on it without even watching it?

"I skipped around through it and the 45 seconds I watched were fucking terrible." 

Translation: "Didn't watch - Still Criticized!" 

Seriously, go fuck yourself if you're this type of person! People work hard on videos and your comment isn't wanted or needed! 









 I used to do stand-up but stopped doing it to pursue filmmaking/improvised comedy. Recently, some new opportunities have arisen that may require me to do some stand-up on the side. I wanna talk about subjects that actually interest me, and definitely subjects that haven't been done to death. I've written some jokes on Star Trek, a few on being married that send up the "married life cliches" in stand-up and sitcoms, and a few on death that lead into the concept of Hell. I'm most proud of the last ones because, not only do I think they are the funniest bits, but it's a very interesting subject that I don't think I've heard many comedians talk about. The only thing that comes to mind is George Carlin's "but he LOVES you" bit.

So, I'm wondering, what are some topics you, as an atheist, would love to hear some comedy about? You know, there's SO many things that comedians could touch on but they don't, I just want to know what the community itself wants. 

edit: For reference; here are some examples of the Hell material: "... I mean, you never see a father trying to discipline his kid going "HEY! BILLY! Quit hitting your sister with the stick or I swear to Christ I will punch you in the fucking face! And I'm not JUST gonna punch you.... I'm gonna punch you...... FOREVER!!!

Also, "The belief in Hell clearly stems from these peoples' history of being abused as children as well as living in a society that recommends and accepts it. It implants warped views of justice in their minds and gives them a sense of an unavoidable cosmic malevolence.... trust me, I googled it..." 

















































 My daughter is two years old and I've been thinking a lot about when the time comes when somebody in our family tries to push religion on her. It'll definitely happen and it'll likely start with something they'll see as "small and harmless" like the concept of heaven. I'm trying to prepare my way of explaining it to her when she asks me about it, tell me if this sounds good:

"Well, a lot of people believe that when we die, we go to a special place called Heaven. Grandma, Grandpa and a few people we know believe this, but they don't know for sure. NOBODY knows for sure if it's real or not or even what it's like. We DO know that when we die, some people have these very realistic dreams and sometimes people go to heaven in these dreams where they'll be happy. Sometimes they see old friends or family members who made them happy. Sometimes they go to their favorite place in the world that made them happy in life. I think this is why people want heaven to be real, they want to be happy. But it's far more important to be happy here and now, while you can. Dying is a natural part of life... we're given a short time on this earth to experience happiness, sadness, anger, delicious food, fun, responsibility, and to do or create something important that makes everyone else's lives better. As for what happens when that time is over... NOBODY knows, even if they tell you they do. NOONE knows because noone's ever lived to tell about it.

 That's the only reason I could think of that anyone would wish they could change their sexuality.

But what they really mean is, they wish that people didn't hate others so aggressively for something that doesn't affect *their* lives at all.

She seems really competitive when she's playing a video-game.

 If you've ever been in a live-action video, you'd probably understand what an uncomfortable experience it is. You have these bright lights on you, a camera pointing at you, a microphone dangling over your position, people behind the camera watching, and an audience in the future will be viewing your every move expecting to be entertained. The main thing that defines good acting is the ability to put that awkward situation past you and be entertaining or funny or portray a character with emotions.

Ross has a great technique of playing his uncomfortable awkwardness for laughs. Ross's mannerisms in the live-action videos are a character unto themselves. He's often at his funniest in those videos

 I get what you're trying to say, but a remix is just something that uses the actual work but adds or changes it a little. For a parody, you would have to reproduce the music (thus, the imitation) AND change the lyrics. Neither that nor a parody are abstract concepts, they're pretty clear.

But remixes can be protected under fair use as well, as long as they meet certain government standards, unfortunately, one of the requirements is that it can't be done for profit without permission 




 No they cannot! That is the goddamn point! You can't sing small portions OR large portions! I'm not spamming, people like you just keep refusing to do any research! Fair use is clearly defined by law and that is not someone's opinion!

If you need different links, I can provide you with some, none of which you can't find yourself on google, but I assure you that they will all say the same thing. Here's one that debunks that weird '30 second rule' that people throw around. (one you probably believe, which is why you seem so adamant on your factually disproven position)

http://studentpressblogs.org/nspa/the-non-existent-30-second-rule/ 




 No, then they are **commenting** on the other target. Parody just means a piece of writing, music, etc., that imitates the style of someone or something else in an amusing way.

If they were 'parodies of the other target' then they would be imitating THAT target. Parody doesn't mean 'make fun of' even though it is usually a requirement to achieve effect.

I can reproduce the music and melody but change the words to, for example, "I'm Coming Undone" by Korn to "I'm cumming on Jon" and it would be considered a parody, even though I'm not commenting on the song itself. 

Not every parody has to be a Bart Baker video where you literally just trash the artist for the duration of their song 




 Why do you think they are protected legally? 

They aren't 'false claims.'

They performed songs on record without the rights. You can't do that, they can't do that, random people on youtube can't do that.

It is called INFRINGING! It is illegal and it puts their business in jeopardy!  

Take a moment to actually READ this, and I suggest you do the same for other topics before posting and perpetuating a misconception:

http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm 




 For the same reason there are movies and other copyrighted works on youtube. Youtube can't police everything all the time when hours of content are uploaded every minute.

Just because people do it doesn't mean it's legal 




 In case you see this, Suzy:

We love you!

 




 Even if the videos aren't monetized, it's still illegal to perform a song without the rights 




 No. It's a legal thing. Maker is trying to cover the Grumps' seven asses against copyright infringement claims.


http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm 




 Parodies don't have to be focused on the original work. It's perfectly okay to make fun of another target. 

Weird Al for example, I can't think of an instance other than that Nirvana song where his work commented on the original 




 It should end with a T-Shirt Commerical.

The shirt being advertised says "Gone Grumps" 




 True, the parody solution is the only viable one they have, even if they just change the last line. (They could re-upload those episodes with the singing parts edited to parody songs, or just censor them out)

I even posted this suggestion a few weeks back and a few morons decided to comment about how evil Maker is for taking the videos down (despite just protecting the channel by doing so) and that anyone can sing covers, yadayada. I deleted it because I didn't feel like debating with a bunch of stupid fucks. (Hardly a debate if it's fact vs opinion) I feel like too often on the subs I have to correct misconceptions a lot of people have over the business side of entertainment.

But man, everything I hear about Australia makes it sound so much better than America 




 People who hate Suzy and people who don't know how a business functions seem to be so adamant about this.

Everyone else either doesn't care or silently disagrees with the creepy fucks (and trust me, that 'everyone else' is exponentially higher than the vocal minority) 




 and hopefully the Grumps will unlock him and he'll be a special guest soon (and periodically in the future) 




 A couple of creepy fucks did a creepy fuck thing to try to prove that Suzy is Super-Hitler or something.

Over something that doesn't even involve Game Grumps.

Seriously, this fanbase... wow... 




 There is an actual legal problem, it's that singing songs you don't have the rights to is copyright infringement.

http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm

A lot of people here have a misconception about this, thinking it's something covered under fair use, but that would only work if Game Grumps was a review show (and reviewing the song in question)

While youtube's automated "third-party content" detector does suck, they can repeal false claims. But if they get flagged with proof that they infringed on someone's song sitting right square in the middle of the video, it won't go over well for them.

I know it seems unfair and I know you see it everywhere on youtube, but it is illegal to perform cover songs without permission. (And, you'd be surprised to see how many covers have been flagged and now all the ad revenue goes toward the copyright holder) 




 no you cannot

http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm

edit: Lol, I got downvoted for posting a fact. God, this sub is stupid 




 You can't sing songs for 10 seconds, 5 seconds, not even 2 seconds (if you can even fit it in that short of a time)

It's copyright infringement and that has the potential to get them flagged, which puts their business in jeopardy.

Just because you see people on youtube doing cover songs does NOT mean it's legal. You also see people post clips of movies they don't own. 

http://diymusician.cdbaby.com/2012/03/on-posting-cover-songs-on-youtube-music-licensing-law-explained/

edit: Lol, I got downvoted everywhere that I posted facts. God, this sub is stupid

Literally everything you said is inaccurate, except for saying that Game Grumps makes money from their videos. (not your fault though, people perpetuate these myths so much that it becomes one of those things accepted as "common knowledge" even though it's completely wrong) 




 You don't need to "see evidence" to understand how a multichannel network functions.

Maker has access to the channel, that doesn't mean they control it.

Multi-Channel Networks (MCNs) are entities that affiliate with multiple YouTube channels, often to offer assistance in areas such as product, programming, funding, cross-promotion, partner management, digital rights management, monetization/sales, and/or audience development"

They pulled the videos because those videos were infringing on copyright. If all of those videos got flagged at the same time, and Youtube accepted the claims, the channel would be shut down immediately, considering that it only takes three strikes.

Maker was not acting maliciously, they were protecting the Grumps, even if the Grumps think they should be able to sing random songs.

They still can sing songs as long as they change the words and make fun of them, therefore classifying it as a parody. They'll soon realize that and I'm sure they'll go back an re-edit those videos to include parody versions of the songs they are singing (or at least censor those parts) 




 Cover songs are NOT covered under fair use!

People HAVE been flagged for this before, it's just extremely rare because most record companies don't care about people just singing a song. (but why risk your business over this? Just don't sing songs)

But yes, it is copyright infringement, regardless if it's considered a cover.

http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm 




 That doesn't make them in control of the Grumps. It just means they have access to the channel in case of situations like these 




 I just shat after an hour or two of constipation.

It was like the weight of the world being lifted off my shoulders

Or, more realistically, out of my anus 




 Best thing I've ever read on Conspiracy Grumps 




 That's the most common myth people believe, but the truth is, it's infringement regardless of the amount of time.


If you are doing a video that falls under fair use (a review, a critique) then using 30 seconds is protected. Game Grumps is not a review show.

And they would also have to PROVE fair use, it's not automatically assumed.  




 Ah, the classic "I say something therefore it is true and I will reiterate it as often as possible" technique. 
Like I've never seen that technique from a marijuana user.

Marijuana is not healthy. There is no reason it should be illegal, but it is definitely not healthy. It's not terrible, but neither is it healthy.

And science disagrees with what you say science says about weed:
www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/marijuana-use-and-its-effects
 




 It wouldn't be via Maker, it would be between themselves (Maker does not control any of the channels that sign with it. Multichannel Networks function like talent agents.) And an NDA wouldn't prevent them from talking about Jon, just behind the scenes details.

Arin explained why they didn't talk about Jon, WAAAAAY long ago and there is nothing sinister behind it:

http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1j21po/thank_you_all/cbae3uj 

Once all that emotion died down it was okay to talk about him again 




 lol, no. It's not Maker's rules, Maker doesn't own Grumps. It's a simple business decision, don't do anything that might get your video flagged for copyright infringement.

And no, it isn't covered under fair use. You cannot sing or play a song that you do not have the rights to in a video that you are monetizing. Plain and simple.

Arin is smart enough to know that it's best not to risk getting his channel taken down over something as dumb as singing some song. 

Though, as long as they parody the song, changing the words/making fun of it, then they have free reign.


EDIT: Lol, why the hell was this downvoted? Because people "disagree?" I'm sorry folks, but that's the sad truth. That doesn't mean you downvote something. Do a small amount of research on copyright infringement, fair use, and the way MCN's function. 




 lol, okay 




 lol "unfortunately"

 People downvote factually accurate information on this sub quite often. I don't know why 




 10/10 




 Man, I wonder if he's ever shit himself and subsequently delayed a video for a decade 




 I didn't know about it until Arin said it. And this was one of my favorite games growing up 




 No, they'd just get the video removed or more likely, claim all of the revenue on the video. I think they'd only sue if the person kept re-uploading the video, fully aware of his/her copyright infringement.

But they'd have to send a cease-and-desist before they brought the person to court 




 It's possible that they were singing songs owned by Universal Music Publishing, which Maker signed a deal with them that allows their partners to use their library of music.

It's also possible that Maker just didn't see those videos where they were singing those songs 




 I don't know why they haven't yet. They're such big Disney fans, Arin has an awesome Keyblade as decoration, and the game is phenomenal!  




 We need to start a petition 




 Maybe for an hour-hour and a half one-off. I really loved the Endless Ocean videos, but those work well the way they did. I wouldn't want to see it as a series because it would last for the rest of my life (damn, imagine how much longer it'd be if they played as a stealthy character in Skyrim) 




 They need to play Pokemon Snap. It'd be a nice, short, but funny series. Lots of laughs to be had with throwing the apples and poison balls as Dan describes the horrific animal abuse Arin is inflicting upon these creatures 




 Well, this is a *fine pickle!* 




 I can make it. You just kinda flap your tongue between your lips really fast while breathing in slowly

Edit: I guess my statement required some downvotes for some reason 




 It tastes pretty good, actually 




 Mad Dog 20/20 




 Yes, in the contract, they do ask for access to your password (they kinda need it to view the ad revenue so they can determine their share of the profits.)

Something like this makes sense. Put a video on private so that no claims can be made against it until the Grumps resolve the issue by either censoring the singing or changing it to a parody of the original song.

Here's something I feel everyone who doesn't understand what a MCN like Maker is or does should read: (it covers all the basics)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-channel_network 




 To protect the Grumps from legal action from the songs' owners.  Plain and simple. They may have had an insider tip that some people in the industry were litigiously searching for copyright infringements on youtube.

All it takes is three strikes and your channel is shut down permanently. Game Grumps has more than three videos that could be flagged for copyright infringement. And Youtube treats you as guilty until proven innocent.

Exchange of advice for money was *just an example* of the services that MCNs provide. For Game Grumps specifically, they find better brand deals and targeted advertising toward the demographic their audience is categorized as 




 You can't "display an entire work" if the work is interactive. One person's experience playing a game will be different than another's. Again, watching a video of gameplay is not the same as playing a game. 

The LP video is a separate product entirely.

Fair use is a defense for when someone is taken to court over an issue such as this. (Civil laws are also upheld in court, in case you didn't know)

Two of the things a court would use to determine if Fair Use applies are:
the nature of the copyrighted work (In LP cases: a platform for the real product, *Commentary* to be provided)
the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyright work. (This varies based on the game's quality, but it at least represents an honest portrayal, as opposed to game trailers or reviews)

Last, but certainly most important, **there is no absolute rules as to how much of a copyrighted work may be copied and still be considered a fair use.**  http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Fair_use

 




 I didn't say they were parodying the game, they are providing commentary. Fair use protects parody AND commentary, two different things entirely. Distributing a video of them playing a game, with commentary, doesn't infringe copyright, because the game is not meant to be observed, but interacted with.

The legality of these videos hasn't been established because nobody's ever questioned it, but one day when someone brings a LPer to court (likely Nintendo) it will (hopefully) rule in this industry's favor, because they are not releasing the same product as the game company. Watching gameplay and playing a game are not the same thing.


My point is, it's in a grey area now, legally, but as long as it is a grey area, Nintendo is not entitled to that revenue. 




 I meant from a legal standpoint. If it's youtube we're talking, the biggest enemy is their policy of "you're guilty until proven innocent. And we won't listen to you when you try to prove your innocence" 




 The first one with Jon 




 Nintendo's been the biggest enemy since Let's Plays became a thing.

Truth is, Nintendo isn't entitled to the revenue because the players are providing commentary, which is the purpose of watching them.

This is considered a "transformative" use and is protected by copyright law.

I think the Grumps will just ignore Nintendo's greedy behaviors and play whatever they want 




 True, but usually deals like this would specify when they'd expire, if they do 




 lol, yes, i was being silly 




 Maker studios has signed a deal for their partners to be able to monetize and cover for the full library of music that is registered under Universal Music Publishing. http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1538590/universal-music-publishing-inks-deals-with-fullscreen-maker-studios

but they don't know about my........

big ol' penis, flopping around,

it's three big feet of pleasure.

Put it in your mouth and put it in your vagine...

Everyone's having a real good time,

when they're hanging around my big floppy penis.

Can't quite stroke it really fast.

Covering three feet of skin with your hand isn't really easy.

Here's how fast I can jack my whole dick,

"Hah, ah, ah, ah, aaahhh."

That includes the back and forth motion,

let's do it again, "Ah aahhh."

"Ah ah ah ah ah ah aaahhhh..."

That's how fast I can jack my peen.

Everybody thinks that they have seen my penis,

but they haven't,

'cuz if they have...

they'd shit themselves.  




 Maker does not own his content, so his partnership with them is irrelevant. Youtube is an international platform and they also do not own his content. 

Okay, I guess I didn't realize (or care) where he lives, but it seems he currently lives in England.

A quick search of England's definition of Fair Use seems to indicate that their copyright laws are nearly identical to America's.

BUT, I just found a neat little thing during my quick research:

Maker studios has signed a deal (as has Fullscreen) for their partners to be able to monetize and cover for the full library of music that is registered under Universal Music Publishing. http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1538590/universal-music-publishing-inks-deals-with-fullscreen-maker-studios

That's a pretty big conglomerate and is likely where he's getting this music from (I don't know though, I've only seen a video or two of his, and immediately had to click away before I destroyed my laptop) 




 I didn't miss it, I just felt like rectifying it. Too many people seem to think hearsay = fact 




 pretty loose with the word "confirmed" aren't you? 




 Sweden doesn't recognize all of the U.S's copyright laws.

There is also no broad statutory limitation of fair use or fair dealing in Sweden, so he's far more protected in this area than anyone from America, where you literally can't even sing a song without the rights to do so, or a mechanical license and royalty payments. 




 Not fact. Straight up myth

Edit: I already received a downvote for being factually accurate, so lemme post this here:

Fair use is a defense one can use if taken to court for using a copyrighted work without permission. 

In its most general sense, a fair use is any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited (less than 30 seconds) and transformative purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. Such uses can be done without permission from the copyright owner.

Game Grumps singing random songs (in most of their cases) even people on youtube singing cover songs are NOT covered by this. It's illegal because it is a violation of U.S copyright law 




 They weren't "assimilated" by them. Too many people fail to understand what a MCN is and what it does. This is what it boils down to; a channel signs with them and they find good brand deals, better CPM rates, advice for growing a fanbase, or production assistance in return for a very small cut of the channel's profits. The end.

Maker doesn't own them, therefore they couldn't have 'assimilated' them. They're still an independent channel. MCNs function like a talent agency.

As for whether they started out **partnering** with Maker, that depends on whether or not Egoraptor and Jon were partnered with them before starting the channel

 Will Jacques and Arin ever finish off the creators of Sonic 06?

 I want you to know that I watched the whole video and didn't learn ONE DAMN THING! :) 




 Well, Arin originally conceived of the show as a podcast.

I'm curious as to what the format of it was before they decided to include gameplay 




 Maybe he's just working on something that just hasn't come out yet.

Like more Table Flip or editing Guild Grumps. Or maybe business-y shit. Or some secret, unrevealed projects. 




 you are correct. He's also in others.

 Warning: Mature Content.

I've been looking to create more improvised content on my youtube channel. I've always ad-libbed here and there in my videos, but this is our first attempt at just straight improvising something from beginning to end and I'm actually quite proud of it, and wanted to share it with fellow improv aficionados.

I need to get my improvisation chops up because I'm conceptualizing a daily improv show/webseries 




 Why not a monthly Toon Grumps on Grumpout or Arin/Ross's channel? 




 What if they cancelled Game Grumps on April 1st purely by coincidence?

"Oh, Ross, I didn't even realize it was April Fool's Day... they all think we're joking..." 









 lol, the end of your comment had my sides hurtin a bit :D XD 




 There are so many explanations out there, but the gist of it is, it's impossible to put out content on a consistent basis. Therefore, the CPM rates are low (cost of an ad every time it reaches 1,000 people) and when your paycheck is low when you're already only putting out a video every few months, that's impossible to live on.

 Yeah. It looks more artistic and significant with polygonal graphics.

Maybe he and Dan will debut on Grumpcade with the same episode 




 Ne'er a truer word spoken! 




 Do you have Soundbooth? If you do, use the preset "Reduce Peaks" apply it, then use the preset "Everything The Same Level" and apply that.

The Grumps use something along those lines with their own preset in their audio program.

 I like Arin the most. He's the funniest and he's clearly a caring and generous guy, considering he built this business using his popularity to give his friends employment, and to help them get their own popularity (I highly doubt Jontron or NSP would be doing well without their involvement with Egoraptor)

I think his comedy is better suited for what he's doing now, a twice a day, ten-minute show where he just improvises, making jokes about video-games, instead of his animations: an occasional 30-second to 1-minute short where he improvises, making jokes about video-games. I don't see all the hype about missing his animations. He's making the exact same jokes on Grumps he'd be making with his animations, he just doesn't have to take months to *animate* the jokes. And let's be honest, he's not exactly a good artist. Decent enough to make animations, but not good.

*Having that said*, I can't stand his opinions on most issues, and I think he has very bad analytical skills regarding video-games and movies. I also can't stand his whining (but I hate whining from anyone, even Dan and Jon.... but Arin does it the most)

And I think he handled the Jon fiasco the right way. If there was a bad-guy in the breakup, I'd think Jon was probably it. 




 But that perception is delusional. It was an official business when Jon was there.

It's impossible to be successful on Youtube unless you run it like a business. It is a job, after all, and Game Grumps was a business from day one

 I don't know why everyone thinks he's so bad at games. I mean, he did grab *ALL 30 JELLY BEANS* every single time! 




 I usually don't care, but there's only so many jokes Danny can make at the expense of Arin's failure before it gets boring. A whole episode of fuck-ups is fine, but not if it's the exact same fuck-up over and over again. Go to a different level and fuck-up there.

Plus, it's just super fucking annoying to hear Arin complain about a video-game. Ever.

 They mostly play older Nintendo games that are basically an abandoned market. The primary reason is, Nintendo hasn't found the Grump videos or cared enough to flag them.

Plus, Maker Studios has a better understanding of the ins-and-outs of the legal issues presented here. I think they'd be confident enough to defend the Grumps in court if Nintendo tried to claim the revenue.

 Nice to see a fan that understands that the channel is more than just a show where people talk around video-games. It's a legitimate business that produces a product in an industry where you walk a fine line between being profitable and being bankrupt, entirely depending on how your audience perceives you.

You also have a fantastic grasp on the New Media industry.

Most people (especially on this sub) don't understand the decisions that Arin made about mentioning Jon and they think that: Jon disagreeing with Arin's decisions = Arin lied.

I think they handled the situation perfectly, and I think they let the right amount of time pass to cement the new era of Game Grumps in, so that they could discuss the old era without the potential to damage the show.

 I liked Jon's part, lol. Like he was in exile. 




 We need Nostalgia Critic and Egoraptor playing a Simpsons game 




 Eh, Bloodborne's been pretty boring so far... but I wouldn't say it matters if it's Modern or not. They should just play what they feel like playing. 

I kinda prefer them fucking up a lot though. It reminds me that I'm not watching this show for the games 




 everybody do.... **The Barry Bump!**  (beatboxing begins) 




 If they turned off the music settings, sure.

It's an amazing game, too, I'd love to see them play it as it'd spark a lot of heavy metal music discussions. 




 Some of the things Arin has said about motivation, hard work, and etc. 




 Yes 




 I saved this country 2 billion dollars in debt by switching to Geico! 




 And the rockets red glaaare!  




 yeah, there's a demo somewhere.

it wasn't good 




 It's an actual project, not just a Let's Play. It takes time to produce, and they don't have a big post-production team. There's a lot of editing that needs to be done, which will be more complicated because they'll have to make sure it's coherent and actually tells a story (even if it is a Reality-Show-esque story) There seems to be a lot of live-action elements to it, and that's a lot harder to edit than game footage. There's a lot more to editing a real project than just putting clips in the correct order. Once the raw edit is done, it is immediately followed by Sound Mixing, Music, Color Correction, etc.  Each of which are difficult and time-consuming on their own.

They also have to balance this project with the other projects they're working on (some of which they probably haven't told the fans about yet)

 "Fantastic at compiling fake job histories and references" 




 Someone posts the same question every other day it seems 




 Yes people can. Would you like to be bound by something you said 2-3 years ago? 




 Polaris would have nothing to do with it, but yeah, they made it into a makeshift studio. Mark hangs out there a lot.

 




 No, none of that should take 20 minutes. And that's not even real editing, that's just overlaying text, and if that takes you 20 minutes, then you might want to consider a different field. Plus, if you use the same font and color every video (like the Grumps do) then you would have it saved as a preset, reducing a 2 minute job to 2 seconds. Keyframing text to fly in does not take a lot of time, though it would vary, it shouldn't take longer than a minute (and consider that it happens once per episode ON OCCASION) 

With the format of editing Kevin is given, using primarily presets and an assembly-line style of churning out episodes, there is no reason he should have messed up any of the times people have counted (other than laziness) The only time he's even responded to people's criticisms is when it legitimately wasn't his fault (an episode being six minutes long) 




 just because "it's the internet" and it's what people have come to expect, doesn't mean it should be that way and that nobody should focus on improving it 




 If they brought in someone that was funny, I think it'd be better.

Plus, it's only Ross that's played with them, so you haven't seen them play off of anyone else 




 Remove the last one, then replace Kevin with Holly and I'd watch it 




 That would be the best series imaginable! This was one of my favorite PS2-era games, I forgot it existed, I'm gonna go look up and see if I can buy it somewhere! Thank you!

(And like everyone else saying this: It would HAVE to include Dan, so either him on Grumpcade or a series on GG) 




 I'm sure VentGrumps has a good list going. Mostly from what I've seen, people say "Kevin edit this in" and he doesn't 




 Every edit that he's missed or messed up on takes about a minute or two to complete.

Source: I'm an editor 




 oh yeah, I forgot about that.... this might suck then 




 I get it! :) 




 He's just a watered down Pewdiepie to me. Neither of them are funny in any way 




 Well, it's already been debunked quite a few times. Didn't even think it was still a fad. I'm amazed he's on it, considering that he seems to think of himself as educated 




 Or he could just be at their office again.

God, I hope this guy is never on GG 




 I don't think working on something with the Grumps and this project are mutually exclusive. It's not too distracting of a task to stop into the Grump office for two hours to be a guest on their show 




 he's not forced to do anything by a Multichannel Network, they'll just recommend certain collaborations and deals to him, likely providing him incentive to meet their requests.

He probably just hates Los Angeles, most people do, honestly.


But I agree with you, the Polaris collaborations are so pointless. Most people don't know the majority of their partners and most of them are kinda the same youtube channel, producing the same content under a different name. But I'm willing to bet this isn't a Polaris project, but a JonTron project that he requested Polaris's help in scheduling/contacting these other youtubers 




 look, dude, I understand it's just a joke, but I can't suspend my disbelief entirely!

**At his job?** Seriously? Jokes have to have SOME sort of basis in reality here 




 Dude, you gotta follow through with the setting and details: For example:

"In prison." 




 Hopefully this raises awareness enough for people to not put their fucking change collection in an unprotected container in a bathroom!

 That's some funny goat-related humor! :D 




 Everybody shut up! This post has given me an erection! 




 I think it'd be more likely that he ditches it for his two bands and other projects full time, along with moving to Cali. But perhaps there's also an available physicist job out there? 




 Lol, I had a webseries in mind that was a parody of Dungeons Dragons type stuff that would use this joke.

This is the only sub where I figured I wouldn't get downvoted for using it 




 I created the joke. I always thought it'd be funny if some actual racist people in a fantasy setting referred to them as "Shadow People" 




 It's just a joke, dude 




 lol, "I left mah lyrics at home, nigga!" 




 They're like people, but their skin color is the color of a shadow 




 Kinda funny. Could've been a little clearer

 He's black. Blacks (aka, the Shadow People) stereotypically abandon their offspring (mostly just the males though) 




 E.T... phone Health Insurance Agency... 




 I'm not enjoying it. It has some funny moments here and there, but I hate when they talk about the games, which they're doing a lot of here (unless the game is interesting, which Bloodborne does not appear to be.) I was actually thinking about getting it, till they started playing it and I realized how boring and repetitive it seems

Edit: Don't forget to downvote if you disagree with me, cumfaggots :) 




 Other than Dave Chappelle and Ron White, I don't like a single one of those or a single joke I've heard from anyof them 




 Write a youtube comment demanding that he come back. 




 Ya know what bugs ME? Steel Panther is in it. God, they suck 




 Then name me some funnier ones 

(This is not confrontational, I'd actually like to discover some if you happen to name any I haven't heard) 




 lol, that story is what sold me on Jim Jefferies. i saw bits and pieces of his anti-religion stuff, but when I listened to the album that one was on, I realized he can be funny with any subject matter. His TV show is pretty good too 




 The funniest Stand-Up Comedian Alive Today 




 And a shapeshifter (He's actually Danny in his spare time) 




 Jon's getting a sex change operation  




 Beej 2: The *coming* of JonTron 




 As much as stoners like to THINK they are funny or interesting when they're high, they're not. I don't think a single one of them even smokes weed (excluding Danny, who used to) and despite Stout Train existing, none of those episodes were good at all. (And I LOVE alcohol, so I thought it would be interesting, at least if they discussed it)

I wouldn't mind a Drunk Grumps with just Dan and Arin, especially if it's Arin's first time being drunk, but it would have to be a chill, non-obnoxious episode and not act all stupid-drunk like Barry and Ross did. Something more along the lines of Toon Grumps would be interesting. (I mean, they can play games, but be FAR less into whatever is on the screen)

But stoned? Sorry, but I'd skip over an episode of them just laughing uncontrollably for no reason and talking about how hungry they are. 




 That would be the most horrible edition of Game Grumps in its entire history 




 Yep, played it last week. It's aged beautifully and I don't think a single Mario game has topped it since 




 Anyone know when he'll be on Sleepy Cast? I'm more excited for THAT 




 I know, right!? How can they not know shit about the dude who invented **Salad!?**

 The Second Endless Ocean is my personal favorite. They're both at the top of their comedic game in that one. That's the first episode of GG I've rewatched (haven't finished it yet though. Been meaning to start it where I left off) 




 lol, dude, Game Grumps doesn't have a parent company and you're reading WAAY too much into them going on vacation. Do you know how much Starbomb albums have sold? They can afford multiple vacations 




 2 is the only good one anyway. If he played the first one I can see why he hate it.

I'd like to see a Spyro game on Grumps. Danny seems to love dragons and shit like that, so that could stir up some passionate discussion 




 He should get one or two stars from each, then fight Bowser 




 My fellow Americans... this nation is------ **I'll be right back!** 




 "Well kids, sorry, but that's the seventh night in a row... you know what that means!"

(Arin.... how do you **LIVE** with yourself!?!?) 




 If you watch Grumps for the gameplay, then something is seriously wrong with you.

However, it isn't entertaining if someone keeps making the same fuck-up over and over and over and over again and blames the game for it. Not because I'm watching the gameplay and I want to see progression, but because the conversation becomes stagnant, and it's just annoying to hear Arin ~~bitch about~~ er- "analyze" video-games.

Personally, I can't even stand when they talk about games at all, because for the most part, they aren't funny about it. But there were a few episodes recently where the fuck-ups actually were hilarious. Maybe they just need to learn to edit some moments out like that. If there are a bunch of fuck-ups that are funny, leave em in. If not, then just cut out that footage, and use the star selection screen as a point of transition, that way nobody knows anything was edited out

Just treat the show like a podcast that uses video-games to inspire discussion and it's entertaining. Otherwise, not so much. Arin and Danny are both super funny guys and I don't watch GG to see them beat games. It'd be better if they stopped playing them every time they weren't having fun 




 I can't stop laughing at this! :D 




 Ah, an illiteracy joke. Clever :)

 It's being edited. It's an actual project, not just a Let's Play. These things take time. Perhaps Barry is the editor and perhaps it got delayed because he felt overwhelmed by *real* editing work. Perhaps it's just a really huge/long project and they don't want to start uploading until it's all done.

 I think it got upvoted by the people who don't understand what Polaris/Maker is and their relationship with GG 




 If anyone is manufacturing controversy, it's the Grumps and Jon themselves. Multichannel Networks wouldn't waste their time doing this because they get such a small percentage of ad revenue from their users. It's not a productive use of their time

 As long as Arin and Danny are there, it would be the funniest Table Flip in history 




 and Arin comes in as Obi-Wan to defeat him 




 It's possible that he was only in LA to film various Youtuber's cameos. Maker has a studio in New York, which he could've been there working on his side of the live-action bits (which are very minimal compared to the gameplay footage) 




 I was fully expecting it. It showed two X-Wings immediately after he said that and I thought it would be Dan and Arin

 have you considered that he has a significant other that he doesn't discuss on the show? He's talked multiple times about not wanting to discuss his private life on the show.

Also, the whole "banging chicks" thing IS a part of his CHARACTER'S persona! Danny Sexbang and Dan Avidan are two different people (one is fictional, if that gives you a hint)

Lastly, why would "not having a significant other" make him gay? Are only gay people allowed to be single? Or are gay people not allowed to have significant others?

This is a big reason he wouldn't want to discuss his private life. Creepy posts like this 




 "Put it DEEP in her butt son.... if she struggles, give her the Ol' 1-2, POW!"

 I get ads every single video and I watch it on my TV. Other channels aren't like this, but the Grumps are for some reason (probably because I watch a succession of videos on their channel) 




 The only time I think he's acknowledged the issues is when they weren't his fault (like when people gave him shit because of the six minute episode, when Arin/Dan didn't record enough footage)

Other than that, he isn't even able to fix those things except for the thumbnails 




 He misses an assload of cues and there were blank frames in a few episodes, the audio levels were fucked up for a while, he put up the wrong thumbnail once or twice, I'm sure there's more, these are just the ones I remember off the top of my head

 So a Rabbi, myself, and a minister walked into a bar and the bartender said "what is this, a joke?" 




  If the entertainer listening to the criticisms is ultimately their own personal choice, then what's the point of your comment here even existing?


There are a lot of stupid people that don't understand the concept of criticism. This is where people labeled ventgrumps as whiners, nitpickers, etc. 

There's already several posts complaining that they don't want to be downvoted if they criticize the show. Why can't they stand that other people have a different opinion? "Oh no I got downvoted! I guess everyone else is an idiot!" is the general consensus amongst people like this.

 The criticizers know that the Grumps have a choice. 

The criticizers don't seem to know much of anything. There was a guy on Ventgrumps shortly before it closed complaining that Game Grumps is "now a comedy show and no longer talk about game design" **that** is exactly the problem with illegitimate criticism. If you don't understand what the show is and always has been to begin with, why should you post your opinion at all? And why is it such a sin for someone to downvote your completely useless opinion?

 Thus, your comment is completely useless.

I can see that it went right over *your* head, but it's not useless if it helps ONE person understand my point 




 It's one of the best sketch comedy shows out there.

Check out their movie "Run Ronnie Run" 




 VentGrumps did the exact same thing if you tried to differ with someone's "Criticism" so don't act like this sub is so much worse when people downvote something they disagree with. 

If they change the show to fit someone else's tastes, then there is a huge chance that it'll no longer appeal to the people who currently enjoy it (the same goes for all forms of entertainment)

The biggest problem I saw with VentGrumps was that people started their ~~whining~~ "criticisms" with the basic assumption that every person agreed that the show has decreased in quality at some point. (and the only ones who didn't were little children/fanboys that had shrines dedicated to the Glorious Grump Gods, or something) This is simply not true and the show always has its ups and downs, people just tend to remember the best parts and think it was more entertaining in the past.

Whenever there was a **legitimate** criticism *(like pointing out that I don't want to listen to 10 minutes of Arin trash-talking a game or watch 5 episodes of Arin dying in the same spot over and over again [both of which were only annoying because the conversations became stale])* I never got downvoted on the main sub and plenty of other people discussed this criticism openly on the main sub without downvoting.

If your post receives a large number of downvotes, that just means more people disagreed with your criticism than those who agree with you, regardless if it's "constructive" or not. Why diminish other peoples' enjoyment to please this **one** random person? If a musician I don't enjoy asked my opinion on how to make their music "better" and I offered some ideas that completely conflict with what their music is all about, do you think they should listen? More importantly, do you think they should listen to a large group of people all saying something different?

The only times I've seen Game Grumps pay attention to constructive criticism is when the majority of the fanbase agreed on something (my examples a few paragraphs above pertained to Super Mario 64 and their final few sessions of that playthrough showed that Dan was definitely listening to the people at that time and they got through with the game without any more problems)
If that's the case, then you won't be downvoted. If it isn't the case and your criticism is downvoted, then you need to accept the different opinion and move on

In the end, an entertainer can only create something that **they** want to, because it is impossible to please everyone.

 what if #HuffNation turned out to be a vulgar sex act? It was all just a ploy to get her to search it 




 She's also on the cover of their album "Strawberries and Cream"

And yes, she's been in a lot of NSP videos and suggested to Dan that they start holding auditions for other models/actresses like her to play Danny's love interests as opposed to just using their friends 




 She's been in several of his videos. BTW, You're friends with Lauren Francesca!? That's already an amazing thing to begin with! 




 It would be the greatest thing that could ever possibly happen on the channel, but sadly might not because Arin is "not interested" in that genre (whatever the fuck that means)

 The only difference I've noticed is Ross seems a bit more talkative/energetic in the Sonic series. But it could just be how he felt at the time of the playthrough, these *are* recorded in short sessions

 If you'd never play them for your family and friends then that doesn't mean comedy has less value, it just means you don't think your family/friends would enjoy this particular band. 




 Nah. As awesome as Skyhill is, there's more value in comedy, which he is really talented at 




 thank you :) 




 It's a subject that interests me (I've never done any kind of drug though and probably never will)

I think what interests me the most is how many people have shared experiences. I've been meaning to look it up myself, but I think others might be able to explain it better than a long complicated article 

Edit: I'm looking for a **scientific** explanation, not the typical spiritual drivel most people use when explaining it (hence why it's hard to research) 




 So did I!

By coincidence these are both my comedy idols.

What is the discussion you're referring to? 




 turns out God created the Earth on accident by spilling his soda 




 He **did** grow up as kind of a spoiled rich kid, so when the time came that he actually had to commit to/work hard on something, he probably couldn't handle it. It makes sense, and he did voice his disdain for the fact that it was a JOB (which is actually a very positive thing, despite his attitude toward it) several times on the show and in the Ode to Jon video 




  If you're JonTron 24/7, it's hard to stay funny and relevant, and that's probably part of why he left

True, but they only recorded on weekends in just a matter of hours. Hard to refer to that as 24/7 




 they're not owned by anyone (MCNs don't own anything, they just partner with people) but yeah, when it comes down to it, it's a **company** with **employees** that needs to keep the revenue flowing, at the very least in a just in case scenario where they end up losing money for some reason. 




 It's a compliment, but at the same time, people should've been educated long ago to understand that improvised scenes can be just as good as, if not better, than written scenes.

I mean, a written sketch/song is just a piece that's been improvised on paper

 turns out he's called that because his only weakness is Crowbars. (not sure why he'd broadcast that information that way, lol) 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pgv4t/iama_egoraptor_that_sounds_weird_i_am_egoraptor/c3p9u6e

That's just one. He's said it multiple times in interviews, this is the only one I know of for certain 




 that's what they're building right now, using money from Game Grumps and Starbomb.

Even if he did go to another studio, that wouldn't require him leaving the channel since his involvement in it is minimal already.

Danny had a day job up until the release of the first Starbomb album (because he only needs to be there for the recording sessions) 




 Wolfjob.  




 It'll be the whole channel once the company finally reaches the stage where they can create content for other platforms that provide more financial stability.

Arin and Ross are each working on an animated series, Starbomb is already a highly profited music project, Danny is always working on NSP and Starbomb, and there will be plenty of ideas that they'll have/pursue in the future.  

I foresee a Ninja Sex Party movie at some point that will bomb at the box office despite being totally rad and hilarious (like Tenacious D's movie) 




 So for what purpose would he leave a job that gives him an area to animate in an office that only asks him to work for an hour or two a week, leaving the rest of the time to animate? 
























 But they would still get stuck, regardless whether they consult the subreddit or a walkthrough. 

Your suggestion doesn't offer a solution to the problem you've posed 




 can't people buy the same hat though?

I'm not an expert, but I bet it's mass-produced 




 link? 




 Oversized Anal Beads 




 In an interview Brian did for Starbomb he said that Arin and Dan both wrote the songs, but Dan did the final draft of the lyrics. 




 But if you know exactly where they get stuck in advance, then it isn't a seamless entertainment experience

It's also not a big deal if they look up a walkthrough. 




 also all the spots in the game that they'll be stuck on

 Houston! We're going down! May-Day! May-Day! We're heading straight for a residential area! 




 Are you guys ready for starvation and joblessness? 




 You haven't unlocked it yet. Advance further in the story and get a higher score 




 They're mainly referring to the production costs. It takes a hell of a lot more time, effort, and money to make something like this than it does to make a Let's Play and even with all that time it takes, you're still putting out **less** content than the Let's Play 




 Yeah, this sounds nothing like the version I have. You can barely hear Arin and Dan's even worse 




 One of the top ones is like "dude, what have you become...." or something along those lines 




 It's illegal to sing a copyrighted song on anything (movies, shows, internet videos, your own musical cover, ANYTHING) that you haven't payed a Mechanical License for. While it's highly unlikely that anyone would go after them for singing these, if they just happened to come across and flag it, just because they felt like it, the video would either get removed or all of the revenue would go toward the copyright holder.  If this happens 3 times, the channel gets shut down. 

Why jeopardize your business over that? 




 I dunno, it just got less and less funny. Suzy was genuinely the funniest for once but then she left for the last two. I felt there were some storylines that should've been edited down, if not out completely, like when they were hunting Arin/Barry, they didn't need to leave in the "phased" part, they could've just cut to them being found. Little things like that, but mostly, it wasn't as funny as it went on 




 Okay.... *now* what? 




 Did ya hear what happened to Jared? He had a freak accident! He said he wanted to go tanning before summer started... 




 that'd be funny in a sketch or something if they always look like shit, like lipstick smeared all over the damn place.

 To do list:

 It got worse as it went on, but I enjoyed each episode 




 Something's wrong with youtube. I had several hundred views on a [video I just uploaded yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv45pHtzCcU) and now it's at like 60.

My friend contacted me, saying this happened to him as well

Edit: They're back now 




 no, it's a George Harrison video. It says it in the title. 




 Grump Craft 




 in other news, this guy is entirely wrong about it being a shitty reality show 




 the point is, they are doing an 8 to 5 job (or longer) doing the not-so-fun side of running a successful youtube channel. They don't just have fun, upload the video, then sit back and collect money. It's a challenging business endeavor 




 I know what you're thinking... did he give me 37 french fries.... or 34? Well, with all these customers, I forgot myself... but you gotta ask yourself *one* question... do you feel, **hungry?**  ...PUNK! 




 This week on Friends: Chandler gets a sex-change operation! And the rest of the gang finds out that each of them has contracted an STD! Tune in for all the *wacky* adventures! 




 It's all the business stuff during the week that he had to do that probably got to him. Plus all the work put into his own channel, not just making the videos, but the business side on that channel as well. It's definitely overwhelming and leaves you emotionally drained.. 




 I thought it was going to be Jon 




 I'll never understand why people expect a normal Lets Play from game grumps, but whatever. People are just stupid i guess 




 Yes definitely! Hell, it doesn't even have to be an animator, it could be anyone! Just sit down and talk over footage of someone creating something 




 She legitimately didn't care, so to her it wasn't about playing the game, like it has been with her in the past.

Suzy's definitely the funniest in Guild Grumps so far :D 




 This is really creepy.

also, who cares about this and why has there been "some confusion?" 




 Yea

 I don't know anything about WoW lore, but I'm sure there's more to it than that small amount of time Ross spent on it 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_II_%28film%29 




 meh, not as funny without witnessing their attempts to understand it. Like Arin's outburst about "that's not even from the game we're gonna play!?"

Or Suzy's interview, where she just looks defeated, but still trying to explain it 




 ok? Mine too 




  But the first 5 minutes was Ross explaining the lore. And that's fine and all, but I really don't think anyone wants to hear about the lore (prove me wrong!

That was the point. He wanted to torture them (especially Arin, who hates plot) 




 It's being WAY overblown. It's no more cruel than just messing with your friends for fun. Even Ross is laughing the whole time about the whole debacle. The point is: Comedy

That same argument can be applied to any 2D sidescroller. Plus, Sonic isn't about going fast all the time, and when it actually is, they're not gonna put much in the way that is unable to dodge. (can't really say that about the modern games, though) 




 You're taking issue with someone offering a different opinion... and people like you complain when the main sub does exactly what you're doing.

I'M taking issue with someone who wholly missed the point of the show. 




 Not at all. Are you fucking stupid? I was merely explaining that people are going to disagree with criticism and that you shouldn't complain when it gets downvoted 




 I played WoW for 30 minutes and felt exactly the same as Arin/Barry. It was NOT fun and the only bit of joy I could scrape from it was messing around with my other friend who, in turn, was not having fun.

The point isn't "let's teach these guys how to have fun with WoW"

The point **is** "let's make these guys play WoW even though they don't want to." 

It was extremely funny to watch them scrape some fun out of this experience that they wanted no part in, that someone worked hard on preparing. There were several moments where I laughed my ass off, the one coming to my head right now is when it cuts to Ross in the interview room, with his head in his hands, not even saying anything, then cutting straight back to the action.

In the end, the entirety of the Game Grumps channel amounts to turning on the recording devices and spouting funny dialogue or waiting for something funny to happen in-game. It's a fucking **comedy** show

  The Grumps have an established fanbase now. They'll watch anything the Grumps put out

Or perhaps there are people who genuinely enjoy this, despite the fact *you* didn't. There is no need to insult people for their tastes and demean something you personally didn't enjoy. 




 They are comedians joking around. Noone was mean to Ross and Ross was playing up his despair for laughs. This is not meant to be taken seriously in any way, even Ross's work put into crafting the whole thing 




 Ross already lost it. Arin made sure of that 




 No it's not scripted. That would be so much extra work and ultimately wouldn't be any funnier than if they improvised. 

Plus it just defeats the purpose of the "reality show" angle
