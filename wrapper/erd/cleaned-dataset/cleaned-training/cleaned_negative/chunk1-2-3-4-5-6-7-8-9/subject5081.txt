 The show's main stars are the cars.  

The only thing different is that the show isn't advertiser driven, so they can openly criticize and mock companies like Ford, Porsche, whoever.

 There's a reason why ODB had 13 children. 




 Ha.  I thought he just smashed the top tube first then tried sawing it thinking it could be welded back.

I'm guessing he pulled it from the trash (hence the rebar bike stand) or purchased from a police auction where they overbid crap.

I think a professional thief/seller would pull the parts and sell it or put them on another frame.

Maybe I like to think we live in a world where thieves are a bit more savvy.

I just don't think comedy has an 100% approval rating.  

He was funny when he cracked on Jim Norton for having a mancrush on Dice.  "Hey Jimmy you want to go to the mall together, ohhhh!" in Dice's voice.

 I think it's more than plausible he's gay.  You probably can't be openly gay to be on a shitty family sitcom.

He can date and marry much further up the Hollywood food chain yet chooses Diane.  Like he's not interested.

 Gordie Howe, eh?  Never heard of him.

It was actually Gordie who signed for less because the Red Wings "weren't making money" and had to sign his teammates too.

Then they leaked Lindsay's contract that was inflated to discredit him and his attempts to unionize.

Howe became a household name.  Lindsay got railroaded by politics. 




 Scrolling past something you've already seen is hard. 




 There's a hockey movie about how the Red Wings did pretty much the same thing.  As far negotiating salaries.

They won the Stanley Cup then traded away their best player at the time because he tried to start a union.

 /r/mma is worth checking out.  

UFC needs hype-worthy "name" fighters to survive.  Rousey is one of the last one's left.  Concussions, PEDs, gruesome injuries kill their talent quickly.

They pipelined a woman's division for Rousey.  I think she's a bandage to buy time for the UFC to clean up their men's side. 




 The business side of UFC is more interesting than the fighting.

The hyping of Rousey in lieu of all the men getting popped for drugs is pure magic.

The person who hipped me to the highlight reel narrative was a married woman years ago.

There's also drama, tragedy, first world complaints....  People complain about the weather, traffic, their partners, raising kids.

I think it's morphing into a more complete real world view.  

If you sign up to get married and cheat, you're simply a person of low moral character regardless of society or social media.

He picked a person who was into such things and obviously capable of cheating.  He's part of the reason why he's divorced.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Callahan_%28American_football%29


In January 2013, Callahan was publicly accused of sabotaging Super Bowl XXXVII by several former players.[5] According to comments by Tim Brown and others, the Raiders struggled on offense during Super Bowl XXXVII because of Callahan changing the game plan from a heavy run attack to a heavy passing one on the Friday before the game. Brown offered no proof for the sabotage claim, but said: "this is the problem we have, because of [Callahan's] relationship with Gruden, because of his disdain for the Raider organization; that's what makes people get to that conclusion."


 Rich Gannon defended Callahan, but did suggest that Oakland may have been disadvantaged by Callahan's failure to change the terminology for play calls at the line of scrimmage. According to Gannon, the same play names had been used during Gruden's tenure as Raiders coach, and Gruden had taught his Buccaneers defensive players these play names.


Jerry Rice, an NFL Hall of Famer who was a wide receiver for the Raiders at that time, was quoted as saying, "I was very surprised that he waited till the last second and I think a lot of the players they were surprised also so in a way maybe because he didn't like the Raiders he decided 'Hey look maybe we should sabotage just a little bit and let Jon Gruden go out and win this one.'"


Callahan has denied the allegations, stating that, "While I fully understand a competitive professional football player's disappointment when a game's outcome doesn't go his team's way, I am shocked, saddened and outraged by Tim Brown's allegations and Jerry Rice's support of those allegations made through various media outlets over the last 24 hours. To leave no doubt, I categorically and unequivocally deny the sum and substance of their allegations." Callahan further referred to the claim as "ludicrous and defamatory."


Brown backtracked from his comments a day later, denying having said that Callahan sabotaged the game. 




 Bryce Petty looks good.  I think what makes Peyton and Brady good is quick reads and quick throws.  If he can adjust to that style, he'll be a good NFL QB.

 Jerry is snobby queen who complains about everything. 




 Give some examples of Gawker articles you've disagreed with?  And some with bad science?   




 Not exactly the right term, but lots of poverty and crime in the city that's why everyone lives in the suburbs.  The city is corrupt and bankrupt.  Illitch and Ford were masters at exploiting this for their sports teams amongst others.  

http://www.thefreedictionary.com/banana+republic 




 Most people that claim Detroit live in the suburbs. 




 That's some serious due diligence. 




 Title and quote.  Not really sensationalized.

And elected officials should be held to a higher standard.

Or not in this case.

 It's funny because it's true. 




  The federal crime rate in the City Council is higher than in the most dangerous ghetto in the city. 




 Ha.  Chicago is a red tape corrupt shitshow of a city. 




 Classist 




 Because being petty doesn't really accomplish anything. 




 She is probably trying to avoid legal liability.  




 They report news.  This is a news site.  Tough call. 




 I laughed. 




 Downvotes are my favorite form of validation. 




 At 6:47 he puts his suit and tie on.  Minus the shirt. 




 7.8 yards will now be a first down. 




 He'll get flagged for verbal and emotional abuse when he cusses her out for a non-call. 




 Unethical.  Immoral.  Deceitful.

Not a way to conduct legitimate business. 




 The mods are cops 




 That's a great idea for a movie. 




 Is this a lightbulb joke? 




 They're probably making a killing from this.  The box probably costs more than the product.  They're adding healthy buzzwords.  

Store brands usually don't have to try as hard as outside sellers.

 Never thought of movies as a social thing. 




 That is the pooping picture.  Butt against the wall.  Head back.  Ready for magic. 




 They took the points off the TV broadcast shortly thereafter.  

It's not like Notre Dame wouldn't have caught it on the official score. 




 Not really depending on the emotional instability of the audience.  




 Tis a joke. 




 Sometimes I think this whole subreddit is getting trolled. 
























 Works for Bill Simmons 




 Lighten up.  Just downvote the shit you don't like.  Upvote the shit you do.   That's how reddit works.  No need to take yourselves and entertainment so seriously. 




 He said he didn't want it. 




 This man knows his shit. 




 I didn't realize this.  

I also think fish oil in large doses works better for inflamed muscles. 




 ....for men. 




 Just downvote it.  Or cry. 




 I make my own powder supps.  The only thing that burns is cayenne pepper when you poop.  Turmeric, ginger, and black pepper are really mild.

Zinc and B vitamins on an empty stomach can make you nauseous.   




 Woah.  That's some intense police work there. 




 Is there a YIL? 




 Just a puff piece.

  "victom blaming"

I like that 




 He obviously wasn't really playing basketball. 




 "Different cultures, cunt."

 Kefir is pretty easy to make, too.  It's drinkable.

I nuke the milk to temperatue.  Dumb some kefir in and wait.  It's pretty forgiving, too.

 LA Gear 




 Well he does editorials like this all the time.  Feel free to post the ones you disagree with. 




 I saw her live and up close.  She didn't sing.  It was also a free hour long outdoor concert that wasn't broadcast, so the fans were getting what they paid for. 




 Low altitude flying 




 The guy is an actor.  Still pretty good. 




 I understand people not liking Olbermann because he plays a caricature to make a point, but he's usually right.  

Hope Solo should have never went on TV.  She also shouldn't beat people.  She brought this all on herself. 




 Or PEDs and changing his body's chemistry 




 Nope.  It autotitles them like that. 




 If everyone has a beard, then it's really not unique.

Some people do look legitimately ridiculous in beards. 




 It's a joke 




 The history of the Lions being terrible. 




 The largest crowd to ever gather at the Silverdome was on September 18, 1987 for Mass with Pope John Paul II, with a reported attendance of 93,682 - just shading the record of 93,173 set at the Silverdome on March 29, 1987 for WrestleMania III. 




 Chris Evert has 7 titles 




 They need a height division for men's tennis.  That dude was amazing for a short player.

 Has never won a real war without outside help since never?  

Nice insult, bro. 




 Cabrera is on steroids though 




 LOfap 




 They're both cute and ultimately bland 




 Sour cream and sriracha.  They're pretty good. 




 I'm only laughing because I don't want to feel like a dick for laughing. 




 Deep 




 Ha.  Never thought to. 




 That's how reddit works 




 The other guy is great too.  They're selling a $250/year credit card. 




 That's the joke 




 What does yelling keeper mean? 




 Society, essentially other adults, feels the need to judge the decision not to have children.  




 It's because social media didn't exist back then and Hannibal framed the story/joke well.  His show wasn't meant for broadcast.

Google Bill Cosby memes 




 She recently died.

 He was part of this, the largest bankruptcy in US history.

 He's also a potato

 He puts himself at the center of the contestants' jokes and hams them up.  He's not really funny.  




 I think this qualifies as Tia 




 Sense of humor = none :) 




 Typical Robin Williams, stealing other comics jokes. 




 Batman and Robin (Williams?) 




 It's a different opinion.  Probably doesn't resonate with everyone.  What does?

 She was probably drunk.  




 They never did.  They're a piece of medal embedded in a sidewalk. 




 "Moderators may use their discretion to determine whether a post is trashy or not."

That's a fancy way to say you're taking it out of the vote of the subreddit and censoring shit yourself. 




 Why? 




 Defensive much.  Shit like that is silly.  It sounds cute but you don't get much out of it. 




 You're going into construction and lane switches.  It's not a smart place to pass or ride side by side with any vehicle.

Why not slow down and keep some space?  There are better spots to pass. 




 Sounds silly

He does have a snobbishness to him.  He also talks down to his audience. 




 30Rock openly made fun of GE.

But late night TV is more a commercial within a commercial.  Dave does have a crotchetiness to him. 




 It's one fucking coyote pup.  Lighten up. 




 2nd place is a pretty good showing for the Sabres. 




 It was a reach, but now I'm convinced. 




 Some good trolling.  




 It's not a savvy business move, then. 




 It's also a savvy business move.  Why produce a show that's going to be a ratings failure when you can run a rerun for with no production cost that will also be a ratings failure? 




 Leno was a ratings machine.  He was obviously pretty good at what he was doing, so much so they'd admit Conan was a mistake and pay him to walk away.

Here's Kimmel impersonating Leno:

 This an honest, open story from a young woman about her marriage. There are some powerful truths spoken here, worthy of notice and reflection. If youre married, have ever been married, or plan on getting married eventually, this is for you.

 Not everyone.  Not overrated. 




 It plumps when you cook it. 




 It sounds like a laugh track/canned laughter.  I think people might be getting had on this. 




 Fecundity means fruitfulness and fertility, the ability to produce abundant healthy growth or offspring. What a wonderful word fecundity is! It refers to a powerful productivity, usually in the area of natural growth, either from the earth or by human reproduction.

Great quality subreddit. 




 "Now 50% more corny references."

He's so fucking street. 




 Never heard that expression.

They replaced the train.  The track looks all the same.  It's an upgrade, they're calling a new ride. 




 Is it triggering? 




 Which one is he? 




 You're the first person who acts like Nike is ethical. 




 Funny to teenagers doesn't necessarily translate to funny to everyone.  Rewatch his comedy.   




 He's pretty much always been kond of a snide asshole.  But that's hip and cool.  

Never really heard him saying anything funny.  Just laughing.

 




 They're called moderators and they just delete posts. 




 They don't want to relearn a new possibly struggling QB. 




 Ha.  So much kneejerk.
