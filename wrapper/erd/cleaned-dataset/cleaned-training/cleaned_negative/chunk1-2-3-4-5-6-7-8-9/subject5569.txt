 For $18,000 should you steer clear of a salvage vehicle?  Uh, yes. 




 Everyone falls off the wagon.  We get sick, we get hurt, we get tired of eating healthy, tired of working out.  That's natural when you're making a life change.  Humans are resistant to change.  It's in our nature.  But you can get past it - heck, you've already lost 20 lbs.  Most people don't get that far.  Just keep your chin up and keep your goal in sight.  It may take some time - believe me, I know.  But you can do it.  We all know you can.

 According to the Anandtech review, they do not.  Also, given how much noise Motorola is making about their support, the fact that LG says nothing about it is pretty telling.

"However, this can be explained by the change to charging protocol, as it seems that the G3 doesn't support Qualcomm's Quick Charge technology. Instead, signalling is done over BC 1.2. As we'll see later in the article, this is due to the charger chip used."

"It's also a bit interesting to see that a TI BQ24296 charger chip is used instead of a Qualcomm solution, which means that the Quick Charge protocol isn't supported. It seems that signalling is done via BC 1.2."

 It's not worth $30K; that's what you paid for it.  There's a huge difference.  KBB says a 2013 BRZ with 10,000 miles is worth, in excellent condition, for a private party sale, up to $21,999.  When you're right on top of 50% value in damage/repair costs, that's when they tend to total...For your sake, I hope they don't. 




 Been referred to as nannies at least 10 years now (first I heard the term was in my GTO group in 2004 - when I was new to RWD cars). 




 If the quote is that high for repair, insurance may total it.  Hope you bought GAP insurance because you may otherwise find yourself without a car.

 So take 35% off your gross and you'll have a decent estimate of your take home.  At $40k you're bringing home about $2200 a month. 




 I'm still trying to decide if I want to buy winter tires or not.  There was only a total of about a week this past winter where roads were bad and on those days our offices were closed w/telework.

 Any tune can potentially void your warranty but in the US you're protected by the Magnusson-Moss Warranty Act, which puts the burden of proof that your mods caused a problem on the car manufacturer.  You do have to be willing to fight though, because they'll always look for the easy way out. 




 Finally, someone else who understands! 




 If you have ready access to E85 use that instead of the Crawford BPBs. 




 No, OFT is fully removable and doesn't leave any flags behind like ECUTek. 




 You should start the lugnuts by hand using the socket before attaching it to the wrench.  It sounds like you might've cross-threaded the lugnuts especially how you described the nut getting stuck.

Also, never use a torque wrench to remove things, no matter what mode you have it set to.  That's what breaker bars are for, and they're cheap. 




 That's cute, dear.  I've been on the Internet for 25 years, since my dad brought home a 1200 baud modem from work.  I'm used to it.

Performance modifications are not now, nor have they ever been, rice.  Jackass arguing with me has a problem with me removing weight from my vehicle for some reason.  Weight reduction can be both the cheapest and also most expensive ways to increase performance.  That I make my car to suit me and don't intend to race it doesn't make it rice.  It just means I'm not interested in racing my car.

The definition of tchotchke is "a small object that is decorative rather than strictly functional; a trinket.".  My statement was not an insult, it was a statement of fact.  "Blew" is a colloquialism for "spent" as you must be well aware.  I can even use it in a sentence: "OP blew all his money on tchotchkes".  Translation: "OP spent all his money on decorative items".  See how that works?

You may believe the way I phrased it was insulting, but that's just jumping to conclusions without thinking about the meaning of what I wrote.  Telling me I have no friends, drive a rice car and will get tickets is nothing BUT insulting, as there is no factual basis for any of those statements. 




 If you're buying it from a US carrier, there still hasn't been a single update.  But all the US versions can be rooted so that helps for optimization. 




 Yes, it blinks.  Does it even in a base FR-S. 




 What part of THE BACKSEAT IS SMALL AND I DON'T USE IT AND IT'S MY CAR don't you f'ing get??????? 




 Where have you found to mount one of these in an 86?  I tried it, but found it very unstable.  Certainly not the performance I was looking for in something that cost $30. 




 Moving magnetic fields are how things get screwed up.  There are tons of magnets around you every day and your credit cards and phone don't get wiped out.  High voltage lines generate huge magnetic fields and they don't kill your car when you drive under them.  I've been using a magnet mount with an iPhone 5S and now an LG G3 in my FRS for 5 months now, without any issues whatsoever.  They do test these things, you know.  Also, yes, I'm fully qualified to make the statements herein as I am a degreed electrical engineer. 




 Salesmen, even if they're your best friend, are still salesmen.  They have their soul extracted when they're hired, along with their sense of decency.  I have personally witnessed this with "friends" twice in the last few years.  They stop being people.  I wouldn't trust a car salesperson any further than I can throw one.  :D 




 Do you REEEEEEAAAALLLLY think that all of these are automatics?

Hint: no.

Where'd I get the pick?  FT86club.  Port in Japan packing these suckers out a couple of weeks ago.  http://www.ft86club.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1914420 postcount=477 




 I'm going to offer up a different mount solution, more available (Staples carries them, so do some Walmarts, but always Staples) and less expensive, and finally, easier to install:

http://www.scosche.com/magicmount

I have one permanently mounted right next to the radio on the passenger side (fully on the radio surround - it's about 1/4" wider than the sticky base, fits perfectly) and a second removable suction cup one that I use on travel and also with my OpenFlash Tuner. 




 You've obviously never read @Anthony's weight loss thread on ft86club if you think this is someone going nuts.

You're quite the rude little shit behind a keyboard, aren't you?

And no, weight reduction is not rice, no matter what you may think.  Weight reduction leads to reduced wear and tear, improved performance and improved fuel mileage.  None of those are a bad thing.  Spending $400 on purely cosmetic items, on the other hand, is pretty much the textbook definition of rice. 




 Are you kidding me with this nonsense?  Even without a muffler, the car is below limits.  My stock CBR1000RR motorcycle is louder.

Many cars come without spares.  Our Hyundai Sonata, for example, came with a flat repair kit.  So does the Porsche Boxster, Cayman, Corvette, Chevrolet SS...I carry a 2 lb flat repair kit I chose based on Amazon reviews, and roadside assistance coverage, which comes with the car if you weren't aware.  http://www.scion.com/promotions/serviceboost/

Also, do you really think someone you force to ride in the backseat of your FRS will still be your friend once they get out of the car?  I would never put an adult back there.  We have other vehicles when we  want people to ride places with us.  The rest of the time. the blonde in my  passenger seat is the only "friend" I need.

I don't autoX so if that's what you'd rather spend your money on, more power to  you, but don't insult my choices just because they're different than your own. 




 That may be true for you but other people use their cars for different purposes, and no one will ever sit in my back seat, so why not save the weight?  Also, the delete kit still provides separation from the trunk.  It's not just removal of the seat and that's it.  There are carpeted panels to make it look nice.  And Seibon has a CF delete that looks really sharp if you have a few grand burning a hole in your pocket.

Muffler delete, 25 lbs, lithium battery, 26 lbs, spare tire and tools, 25 lbs, rear seat delete, 27 lbs IIRC...Things begin to add up pretty quick.

Lightweight flywheel, 10-12 lbs, AL or CF driveshaft, 12 lbs, wheels, lightest I've seen will lose about 6 lbs of rotating mass per wheel, crank pulley, 4 lbs (apparently not good if you have done a flywheel), brakes 5 lbs per corner.   




 http://www.rearseatdelete.com/FRS-BRZ.html

This company has made them for various vehicles for years.  Plastic, covered in carpet, with sound deadening.  $380 shipped in the US. 




 OFT can also be used by a tuner to generate a custom tune.  Same process as ecutek. 




 Ok so I searched Japanparts.com and found everything except the STi logo thing.  Works out to about $400 before shipping.  Start button, $137.  Oil filter, $30.  Key cover, $43.  Battery hold down, $80.  Oil cap, $83. Radiator cap, $40.

So basically, OP could've bought an OpenFlash Tuner, an intake, a lightweight battery, a rear seat delete, i.e. something that would increase performance, for the amount of money he blew on these little tchotchkies.   




 Flying back to DC in the morning...looking for something to pass the time in the evening.  Thanks!

Or, is it just that you don't realize 3.5" diskettes were also colloquially referred to as floppies also? 




 OpenFlash is $645 or $535 if you already have the OFT...But they also tend to have a long wait.  I'd do whichever you can find in stock.

Personally though, EL all the way for me. 




 Wondering the same.  I caught a bunch of hell for making a similar comment in a past thread.  Personally...not a fan of unicorns, ponies...Don't know WTF this has to do with our community. 




 Good work.  Sleep well.  I'll most likely kill you in the morning. 




 Oh, cool, never even heard of Jackson Racing.  However, I looked both up on the CARB site and neither are ok (yet) for 2015 vehicles, so something to keep in mind. 




 OP is not in a CARB area - he posted a thread about Wawa gas.  They aren't in CA.  Also, I believe Innovate is the only kit out there that has a CARB option.  Finally, turbos affect mileage as well.  It's not free horsepower.  Common misconception. 




 ...IF E85 is available nearby.  For me it's over 100 mi to the nearest station. 




 I have a torn meniscus and arthritis in my left knee but I purchased the manual.  This is my first manual.  Passed 4000 miles over the weekend, 17 weeks in.  Driven in DC traffic quite a bit and my knee doesn't bother me.  I'd say the clutch is light but it is only holding 160ish lb-ft of torque.  Haven't wintered in it but plenty of Canadians over on ft86club that have...just need proper winter tires.  A car like this, I'd buy new.  They're likely to be modded, being a niche/enthusiast vehicle.  I'm actually leasing mine but that's because, on average, I don't keep vehicles longer than a year or two. 




 Erm...he says the deal breaker is the concern of someone reading his password as he enters it...I guess I don't understand that issue.  My password only shows up as dots and my entry keypad is randomized (obviously a randomized entry screen wouldn't work for,a,blind person without a haptic screen).  But honestly, we're worried about reading a password over a shoulder?  Really?  Is it only one character?  I can't believe this is a thing...

 The SR-71 display at Pima Air and Space Museum in Tucson AZ is much more impressive than in DC.

 Already have an OFT? 




 Which Fumoto did you go with?  Nipple, no nipple or short nipple w/ plastic insert?  After my free maintenance is over I'm planning on a Stahlbus as I have one on my bike. 




 I am.  My first shift knob being this is my first manual car.  Wish I didn't have to wait a month though.  In that time I'll probably get a set of winter wheels and tires ordered up. 




 I understand except that you're talking about a mechanical system.  It can't rotate at whatever RPM it wants.  At 40 MPH the engine is going a certain speed, the torque converter is going a ratio of that speed, the transmission input and output shafts are going at their ratio speeds, the driveshaft, differential, axles, wheels... It's not magic.  The link I posted in my response this morning has the graphs.  Also at WOT the torque converter is not locked up so it's not as efficient as a manual clutch at transferring energy from the engine to the wheels. 




 No, I understood you were talking a specific speed range.  In an MT 40 - 60 MPH can be accomplished without shifting.  I can't see how an auto would be faster as it would be operating at lower revs at 40 so would not be making as much power?  This is assuming both cars start in 2nd gear.

 Proof?  Or is that just like, your opinion, man?

Stock redline, may be so.  Once tuned, not even close.  OpenFlash Tablet, for example, raises redline to 7600 so it's only a single shift to 60 in the manual.  Stock, 60 is right at redline.

 The 86 is my first manual vehicle.  It was the first manual vehicle I've ever even driven.  The first time I drove it was after I signed the papers.  (I'd driven the auto of course but not the manual).

I drive it in DC.  The clutch is pretty light.  I have a messed up left knee and sometimes it causes me pain after driving for long periods of time in traffic but it's worth it, honestly.

Also, the auto's rearend is geared up from the manual (numerically lower) - it'll get better gas mileage but it will always be slower. 




 Amazon 




 Looks good.

Question though, why does your bumper seem so much darker than your hood? 




 I have the 3D Maxpider Kagu floormats.  Similar to the WTs but a (as I understand it) thicker material (helps keep that stepping on plastic tap tap tap sound down) and they were also significantly cheaper ($40 when I got them a few months ago).

Pic from my build thread: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v698/train_subject5569/FRS/IMG_4014_zps5cba4f43.jpg 




 Also 6' and no problems.  Girth will be a bigger problem than height.  If you're much over a 38" waist you may feel constricted too much by the shape of the seat. 














 Life, uh, finds a way.  You two are evidence of that.  Congrats on the wedding! 




 I've not encountered any sibling rivalry amongst my fellow Twin owners.  Pretty stupid given it's springs and a bumper that make the difference. 




 There are tons of Canadians on FT86Club who DD their vehicles through the winter.  They often talk about Nokian Hakkapapaletta (spelling...I could never spell the Greenland volcano correctly either) tires and/or Michelin XIce2 (3's are often stated as not as good).  Also, weight in the trunk - toolboxes with a sandbag each over each rear wheel for example. 




 OP asked about an intake and an exhaust.  My statement was a list of intake and exhaust parts.

Neither an OFT nor an OFH are an intake.  Even the OFT folks recommend replacing the intake pipe.  Also, OP said he was on a tight budget.  $300 (pipe, filter, muffler delete) vs. $1K is a pretty huge difference.  And that $300 will change the character of the car significantly.

I'm not saying that OFT+OFH isn't worth it - they absolutely are.  However, I was trying to keep my recommendation as low in $ as possible while answering both parts of the OP's question.

Also, not everyone has access to E85.  Where I lived in California and where I now live in Maryland, there is not a single E85 station within an hour's drive.  Kinda hard to use it when it takes a third of a tank or more just to go get it.

 Any reason why the mirror costs more than new and the LED DRLs are same price as new? 




 Ah, not so.  They can do one other thing - reduce weight.  Or gain it. But a single Berk track pipe like I run knocks 25lbs off the rear end. 




 Biggest gains at lowest price are simple: Silicone MAF pipe (Mishimoto, Perrin, Supertek....), panel filter (Perrin, aFe, K N...) and a single exhaust muffler delete track pipe (Berk, Nameless...).  And then as others have suggested go grab an Open Flash Tablet as well.

 California lives by very strict rules.  They will not allow you to move the cat at all.  Not by a micron.  And, within the first 50000 miles the cat if damaged has to be replaced by an identical OE part.  Also, at least in Southern California, they actually have roadside sniffers.  So yes, you don't need a smog check for the first six years of a brand new car's life, but if you get caught doing something naughty by a sniffer, well, ouch. 




 I have a tire repair kit/inflator and a toolbox with a Shorai lithium battery charger and TCW3 2T Oil (with which I was trying to quell the crickets).  Both are velcro'd in place with industrial velcro inside the spare tire area (spare and tools were removed).

P.S. The hard side of velcro sticks to the trunk liner so if you have small things in your trunk just attach a little square and it'll stay put (adheres well enough to hang from the trunk lid liner on the BRZ in fact - I added the kit to my FR-S). 




 That's not even possible since the stock exhaust manifold has a cat in it.

 FOLKS W 64GB SDCARDS - KNOWN ISSUE.  Only fix is to reformat to fat32 for the time being.

Permalink: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=55944771 postcount=106 




 Does your device pingback if its plugged in and you run adb devices?  If not it's not correctly installed yet.  Try a different LG driver pack - there are several on XDA. 




 There was no reason for a huge dev community when it only supported a single device on one of the US' smaller networks.  It'll pick up. 




 Use Tapatalk or the XDA app. 




 You should really learn how to use adb if you want to mod your device - it's very easy to screw things up, and then you'll just be here or on XDA asking for more help. 




 Dude, so you used a shortcut method and it didn't work?  Should've followed the directions.  That's why they're there... 




 It will not see a 64GB card or larger without using a tool to format as fat32 - not a bug; it's a limitation of TWRP. 




 It says right in the dev's video that it's a true unlock, not a workaround.  ROMs always have to be custom made for the device they're going on - that's nothing new.  




 "Auto focus"??  Seriously, in 2014, an aftermarket case needs to talk up a feature of a phone camera, one that most any phone camera has?  Odd.

Because apparently some people aren't aware... ;) 




 Anything's possible.  Could always flash back to stock. 




 Started in physics as that was what interested me a great deal in HS.  First roommate was an EE and I took an intro class for fun, liked it, and that became my major.  I also did significant outside major work in law, business and psychology.  Took the GMATs but ended up getting an engineering job and that's what I've been doing since in varying capacities.  But I wouldn't say my major was strongly tied to the specific work I've done the past 11 years.

Maybe think about what you want to do for work and see what folks recommend? 




 I have a 64GB Pro card currently in my G3.  Compared to a class 4 32GB Sandisk I used in my truck just as music storage, it is lightning fast.  And the phone in speed tests could tell the difference.  As far as a tangible benefit though, not sure.  I was just thrilled to get it for only $70 back in July @ BB via an Amazon pricematch. 




 Try this - you can use the wrench icon after tapping the screen to manage the AGPS state such as downloading new data and resetting the GPS., It can take as long as 15 minutes to get a good lock if you haven't had one in a while so plug into a wall adapter and let it rip.  If you still get nothing, check out where you purchased for some warranty service.

 No, not actually, but whatever.  The poster specifically mentions crickets and the HPFP, i.e. the same squeaking sound most folks also refer to as crickets.  NOT the sound of injection events. 




 Erm...The crickets sound originates from the high pressure fuel pump, part of the direct injection system.  That's very well known.   




 Right around where my lil bro's fiancee lives.  Nice.  We all grew up in Fremont.

If you can find a group of people with whom you share interests and, better, proclivities (i.e. what is and is not rice), all the better. 




 34...Male...Closest representation to my belief system is libertarian, which is barely second string in the US, and that doesn't really cut it.  I'm for: guns, marriage equality, choice (abortion), vehicle modifications, motorcycle lane sharing, reduced law enforcement, separation of church and state, preventing religious organizations from free use of public facilities, preventing religious organizations from operating tax free, preventing businesses from offshoring their tax burdens, against unions, against vehicle mileage taxes...Those are probably the things I care most about 




 Still on the stock head unit.  Really?? 




 So is every G3 user on Verizon.  Deal with it. 




 And what do you do when the demographic you want isn't in the mainstream?  Oh, that's right, not a damn thing. 




 I used to.  I voted for the first time in 1998.  Things didn't go how I voted.  They never have any time since then either.  When I moved last year across the country, I did not register to vote.  I am what you call a disenfranchised voter.  I do not feel like I am able to be represented by the election process as it exists in the US today, so I no longer participate. 




 No, never.  Grandmother lost to cancer, smoker.  Dad nearly lost to heart disease, cancer.  Other grandfather lost to cancer, smoker and alcoholic.

Also, addiction is giving up control to something outside myself, which I just won't/can't do. 




 Mine is always telling me to smile.  I put up a pic of Grumpy Cat that says "I AM smiling" and I colored it the "am" with a highlighter. 




 No.  Nothing is so important to me that I need to permanently etch it into my skin. 




 Eldest of two, was bullied through graduation from high school verbally and physically (rocks thrown, belongings messed with, etc.).

 People say that but there are plenty of people ethanol free who still have crickets.   




  Personally I'm all for technological augmentation.  I definitely don't feel as strongly about it though as you seem to. 




 You're right, this is Reddit, and this conversation happened weeks ago.  So you don't know what all happened, as I said.  Armchair quarterbacking on Tuesday does no good. 




 You have absolutely no idea what you have stepped in by commenting on this thread.  The context button does not even remotely tell the tale.  Nice job jumping to conclusions though.  I had every reason to respond how I did, Mr. Thought Police. 




 They've been talking this over on Slick Deals,and there's a pretty strong consensus that full price orders are not eligible. 




 No, it's a case of to each their own.  I like the idea that the bezel isn't just a spot for the logo.  That's why I'd never look at an M8 for example.  The G3 is nowhere near that bad but in this case the Note 4 is even more space efficient. 




 I've done both.  If your want to have your computer setup to talk to your Android, use IO as you'll get drivers setup, etc. which could come in handy if you need to reflash stock.  If you just want root NOW, use Stump.  Stump seems to make the USB Debugging setting in Dev Options not stick on reboot so you have to edit build.prop to fix it though. 




 Spent some time playing with a Note 4 at Best Buy yesterday.  Very tempting.  Screen is amazing and the camera is faster than the G3.  Also Panorama mode works - I find the G3's to be very glitchy by comparison.  It's right about the same size as the i6+ but slightly wider and thicker, as well as half an ounce or so heavier.  Like I said, very tempting.  And the BB and Samsung preorder deals are pretty good as well. 




 Well that provides a location for the fingerprint scanner.  Also, the menu and back buttons being in the bezel give you more usable screen area. 




 You'd adversely effect the phone's signal performamce if you used a metal cover unless you could be sure it was fully anodized/painted such that there was no metal/metal contact.

The antennas aren't in the metal band like an iPhone so that's why - see RF Exposure Info 1 para 1.4 for a diagram.

 I am a (very) infrequent consumer of alcohol, and I have never been party to illegal controlled substances.  But I don't go around telling others how they're horrible people just because they imbibe certain chemicals, natural or otherwise. 




 Hate to break it to you pal but that map's no longer accurate.  There's a Whole Foods in Fremont now, for example.  Was there in May.  Source: Mk 1 Mod 0 eyeball, plus grew up there and family still lives there. 




 Is that why I can never get Starbucks' app to work? 




 Bisexual male, LTR with a straight but not narrow woman.  As compared to me, she is a nymphomaniac.  Sometimes the physical and emotional needs she has wear on me, but I love her so I try to do my best.  Barring any unforeseen circumstances I intend to ask her to marry me in the near future.  Been down this road once before and am a bit nervous given how that worked out, but that was a different time and place and the ex and I were vastly different people.  Which is to say we were too alike to succeed. 




 Are you me?  Because, that's me you described.  Startlingly accurately. 




 Senior year 97/98 ;) 




 No, not in trouble with the teacher, in trouble with yourself for missing new material.

High school, oh man...Now I REALLY feel old.  That means when I was in  high school there's a one in four chance you weren't even born yet. 




 Don't disagree - have an LG G3 myself.  Be careful doing homework in class.  That got me in trouble back in the day (assuming you're talking college, you'd have been at best a kindergartner or first grader....man I now feel old lol). 




 Could ypu give me a usage scenario?  What would you need side by side?  I guess it's different for me as I can barely use devices in my job due to what I do for a living.  I see commercials of people using tablets and phones in their jobs and I wonder what that'd be like. 




 I can appreciate that.  I'm much in the same situation wrt people I consider friends.  I'm always available for a chat if you need to blow off some steam.  I'm sure many folks here feel the same.  I can't guarantee I'll be instantly available but fairly quickly. 




 I understand.  I heard similar comments when I was younger, but when I came out it was fine.  Yes, there was turbulence, but it was my fault.  I also was no longer loving at home, or even in the state.  Do you have a support system locally?  Friends, your fiance? 




 I can see this being useful on a tablet but on phones, not so sure of the utility. 




 It'll be gone right around the time racism fades away. 




 Why do you have to stay with your mom?  Is a nurse or other family member an option?  What are the reasons you haven't come out, just the accident?  I'm sorry you're going through this. 




 The G3 isn't listed on Mophie's compatibility page.

http://www.mophie.com/compatibility

I suspect that the current output is too low as I've seen that same error from the direct USB port in a Toyota Corolla rental I had last week - tried to charge, couldn't, popped that message up. 




 New features that haven't been incorporated into the regular builds.  Could be better performance, different fonts, different rendering engine...Just depends on what they're working on.  On  the desktop there are three or four different versions depending on how bleeding edge you want to be.  Beta is actually the "most tame" of those as it's where final testing happens prior to release.  I've always run Beta.  I run the Development channel on my desktop.  You can learn more about it from the desktop perspective here:

 Drive it until the tires go flat and then get new tires and drive it some more.  The best thing you can do to ensure your car lasts a long time is learn how to drive it.  Learn how to drive it on sunny days, cloudy days, rainy days, icy days, snowy days, whatever kind of days and nights you have access to.  And those nannies, don't turn them off on the rainy/icy/snowy days.  Enough people have already and they always manage to find a guardrail, curb or lightpost. 




 Nothing like that on my phone...And I have a very dark background.  It does look like a distortion caused by pressure just like /u/chicagostreetwalker suggested. 




 Any Verizon LG G3 is unlocked (for use on other providers except for Sprint).  However, have you verified that the frequencies you need in Brazil are supplied by a US purchased phone? 




 Except that messing with the cats is illegal at the federal level and carries an enormous fine if they catch you.  So keep that in mind.  They don't tend to go after individual owners though - they go after the installers and the manufacturers.  But it's still a risk you should be aware of.

(a) Enumerated prohibitions
The following acts and the causing thereof are prohibited...

(3) (A) ...or for any person knowingly to remove or render inoperative any such device or element of design after such sale and delivery to the ultimate purchaser...

...which is what happens when an ultimate purchaser such as yourself removes a cat.  As an example. 




 Well, given that warranties are time OR mileage, and the first twins were late 2012, and it's only 2014, and it's a three year / 36k mi warranty (in the US)...That's why I went with mileage. 




 Insurance didn't care whether I had a lease or financing.  They asked "Are you leasing or financing?"  I said yes.  Simple as that.  They only care from the perspective of to whom the policy pays out.  Also, I have no requirement to have my maintenance done at a dealer.  Pretty sure they can't legally force you to do that, even on a lease.  Now, Scion Service Boost gives you maintenance for 22,500 miles (basically, first three oil changes) - maybe that's where you're confused?  I'm in the US as well - things don't vary THAT much on a state by state basis. 




 They are slowish in acceleration.  6.6 to 60 in a manual.  They are not slow through turns.  Once you get going, if you know what you're doing, you can cut pretty good times compared to other vehicles.

Source - I have one... 




 Uh...there are tons of people with more than 36,000 mi on their Twins. 




 I'm on 8.1 64-bit; worked the first time.  I'd already set it up for back when I rooted it with ioroot in July though right when I got it the first weekend so that might've had something to do with it.  It was a major PITA to get the drivers setup the first time. 




 Firmware update is the screen you want.  A lot of the directions are unclear.  It'll say Download Mode in tiny font then go to the Firmware Update screen.  At that point you're ready to start LGFlashtool and pick DLL and TOT file.  I just did this yesterday. 




 I did.  Yesterday.  Thread on XDA.

http://forum.xda-developers.com/verizon-lg-g3/general/restore-verizon-to-stock-t2827878

Now yes it says for Verizon but with the right tot file it'll wprk just fine.  Working smoother now for sure.  I disabled all the disableable stuff, then rooted with Stump Root, THEN hooked it to my Google account. 




 Thanks! 




 The one I have just looks like a miniature ratcheting socket wrench - the bits fit into the end.  Similar to this:

 Hey do you have any more pics?  I've been trying to decide between the red/white and the black/white for my 37J.  Leaning towards the red/white like you have as it lines up with what I've been doing (expanding the red accents on the seats out to the rest of the car).

Thanks! 




 Penderyn! 




 Well there was an update today.  Dunno if that'd make a difference for you.  November doesn't really matter though seeing as the G3 only came out in July...

I also rarely text because it drives me nuts.  So I don't know if you're one of the text fiends like most kids these days but I can't frakkin' stand texting.  What takes thirty minutes via text would take 30 seconds on a phone call. 




 The Sprint version was the last one rooted.  You took a big risk getting that version.  It may never pay off. 




 The case back you got does have four pins on it right, not just two?  Some folks have been getting scammed on eBay, only ending up with NFC backs... 
























 Yeah, in Poland.  Not on any U.S.carrier.

 St. Mary's County, Maryland, USA aka "Southern Maryland".  Though I'm not "from" here.  I'm "from" the San Francisco Bay Area originally. 




 I don't like being in a position where I'm not fully in control of my faculties.  I've never smoked, I've never done any kind of illegal controlled substance, and I rarely drink.  I "drank" in college but that meant one beer, say.  I'm 34.

And it doesn't help that my girlfriend (30) just recently discovered she likes to party (drink, hang out at bar, stay out all night w/out me, and I do mean all night - talking 0600 return) and it's really stressing our relationship a lot.   




 I like it.  Never actually seen that one before, where does it get used a lot? 




 Thanks.  Things are challenging right now.  This helps. 




 I did the same last weekend, but ended up resurrecting Twitter and Google+.  G+ for photo backup and Twitter as I use it for many blog logins (to comment). 




 On 3.0 as of yesterday with 11C modem.  Working fine, don't notice much difference, truth be told.  A bit smoother scrolling, that's about it. 




 Not especially.  Usually it's because I called someone out on something and they didn't appreciate it, LOL.

 My OPSEC comment was in relation to some other posts you've made about your duties and qualifications.  Not this post. 




 Ya know, I don't think as an E3 you get to cop an attitude like this.  People make mistakes.  If you hadn't heard anything since September, you should've followed up.

Also, was looking through your posts and suggest this - OPSEC.  That is all. 




 Not to be trendy but I didn't vote either.  I moved last year and didn't reregister.  This is the first time since I could vote that I haven't.  Not a single race locally was affected by my not voting, for those who insist every vote matters. 




 I didn't see it mentioned but Innovate is no longer distributing these in the US - they're being distributed by a US subsidiary of the manufacturer now - Sprintex.

 Ok, OP, so you asked for advice on how to achieve in a career and you got a few folks bragging about their salaries.  Sorry about that.  I won't do the same.

I'm not in software but the general principles are the same.  Perform well at every level and go outside your required duties.  Take extra tasking on that would not typically be expected of you.  Let people know you're interested in new and different opportunities, even if they may seem outside your area of expertise.  Maintain networks of folks you've done work for - you never know when you might need or benefit from a reference.  Take training opportunities that come your way.  Make yourself invaluable.  Learn things that are new and exciting, or old and fading away.  Things that are out there in the world need to be maintained, just as much as the new things need to be created.  Strive to do better on every assignment then you did on the last.  If something's due on a particular date, get it done early.  Anyway, that's what I have for now.

 My parents tried to raise me in their church but it never clicked for me.  I consider myself an atheist. 




 2015s wouldn't be worth it, even if they did fit, given the fact there probably are very few to no systems out there and they'll all be brand new.  At that cost the aftermarket is superior.  That's why older takeoffs and rebuilds are worth iit by comparison. 




 Very good, sir.

 Speaking as someone who's worked as a civilian engineer for the Navy these last 11 years, get a(nother) haircut, hippie.  :D  But seriously, it looks good.

 This idea is not specific to this phone (doing research before updating).  It's all over XDA that this patch would likely close known exploits.  That's the whole point of patches.

 I had roommates for two years and then a private bedroom in a four room "suite"/apartment for the remainder.  It worked out fine.  I went to a small highly technically oriented school so we pretty much all had stuff in common.

 Watched this ep for the first time just a few minutes ago.  Loved the boating.  Though not as many gut busters in this as the few eps immediately prior. 




 Was watching with my girlfriend aboard NAS Pax River...Saw a bright red flash that lasted about 10 seconds then nothing.  Caught up with the live stream on UStream.tv to find out what happened and saw about the explosion.  One of my coworkers watched from a boat out on the Bay and forwarded some pictures as well.  Pretty crazy; an unfortunate setback for commercial spaceflight. 




 What the heck is a "sort of kind of relationship"?  I don't understand this attempting to be with other people when you're in a relationship.  If you're not in it to win it then in my opinion you shouldn't be in it at all...If you feel the need to explore then get it if the relationship.  Sounds like it's not meeting your needs... 




 Tied an onion to our belts too, it was the style at the time you see.

 I've got the Maxpiders as well.  Really wish Husky made the Xact Contours for our cars but they don't. 




 Yes, I understood.  My point was, it is good to share a video of people actually standing against someone, because it's far too rare an occurrence. 




 People actually cared enough to do something rather than turn away.  That in itself is noteworthy. 




 I find myself at DFW quite frequently and I'm sorry to say this is far from the first time I've seen stuff like this there.  Maybe alcohol doesn't belong in airports what with the potential for unruly behavior and all every time there's a delay or cancellation. 




 Well unfortunately we aren't evolved enough as a species to do away with the need for it just yet. 




 I'm think along the lines of Foxtrot Uniform. 




 There is a fix and it's called the Open Flash Tablet.  You're welcome. 




 You don't need xposed or greenify. Everything carrier and most LG stuff can be disabled without even needing root. 




 It is not a "manumatic".  It is a traditional torque converter automatic transmission.  Just because it has paddles doesn't make it a multiple clutch transmission.  It's no different than what's in your mom's Camry. 




 Um...why was ANY of that "funny?" 




 Well obviously in some cases that will work, because it has, but there's always a risk that in a particular update they change something that causes you to lose root or prevents the update from working.  Then again, those of us on Verizon have no experience with this process since we've never had an update yet.  And now that there's an unlock, I never will. 




 Currently you have to flash it back to stock.  Wiping everything in the process. 




 You ignore them. 




 You are indeed mistaken.  Unroot still requires LG Flash Tool.  It's not a Nexus. 




 Even if you are just rooted you should not install ANY update until its confirmed it doesn't cause any issues. 




 It has a .26" larger screen and it's just about the same distance taller and wider which makes perfect sense.

 I saw that too at one Maryland dealer.  Maybe they wait to install during PDI so they don't get scraped up on potential test drives? 




 Indeed!  Folks, for the record, if you want stock updates, then unlocking and maybe even rooting are not for you. 




 13 years can add a lot of perspective.  And I was feeling pent up.  The shitty thing about coming out is that it's something you do for your whole life, again and again. 




 A non gender specific pronoun would be something like "they"...not partner.  But I get your point.  My point is simply, don't expect to get away with that for long as people notice it taking an effort to maintain.  Intelligent people, anyway. 




 Because I used them to refer to someone I was seeing once upon a time and a particular friend/classmate caught on in minutes and basically outed me.  I was ready though so all in all it was a good thing  




 Uh...it was hardly a backdoor pilot.  A backdoor pilot is when you have the folks on NCIS travel down to New Orleans and then the week after NCIS: New Orleans starts.  Or when the guys on JAG go talk to NCIS and the hour after JAG is when NCIS has its first episode.  Or when the Originals of TVD travel down to New Orleans to get into fisticuffs and then next week "The Originals" starts...It's when a show uses another show's setting and varies the circumstances slightly to spin off another show.

 I prefer dark wheels on light colors but otherwise the style looks all right. 




 Lived and worked there for ten and a half years out of college until last August.  Being in the middle of nowhere brings it's own unique benefits and complications.  And it's so often windy.  That really got on my nerves as a cyclist and a motorcyclist.  The average wind is higher than the highest winds at Pax, for example.  But at the same time if you're outdoorsy there's plenty to go and do.  But plan to be out of town on weekends otherwise plan to be bored.

Feel free to shoot me a message if you have specific questions. 




 I guess the person's boot polish did end up catching on fire in the end.  Closing signature says "Singed,..."  ;) 




 Agree.  People catch on to non gender specific pronouns very quickly., Ask me how I know.  ;) 




 Um..no. Unless of course if you're referring to how I typically see other people.

My comic would look like this:
First panel, "On the first day god created nothing, because he doesn't exist."
Second panel: Just a sound cloud with the word "poof!" in it.
No third panel. 




 Cursed.  That's what it is.  Just like the frogurt. 




 These days I run an emulator of the graphing calculator I used in junior high and high school on my phone (HP 48GX).  So in that was they've changed. 




 Actually in that skit they identified a book, the sound a cat makes and the sound a cow makes.  Little tidbits of information throughout.  You have to remember, this was a show for pre-K type of folks... 




 Sheetz.  Ahthankyou. 




 I was only thinking of the data usage, not so much privacy.  I'm sure it'll be all encrypted and what not. 




 For the record...I am not now, nor have I ever been, a millenial.  That is all. :D 




 Been known since the first reviews came out...Anandtech addressed in their review.  LG didn't implement the required charging hardware. 




 I saw this article the other day...It seems like you have to purchase a subscription?  Also, it's sending the recorded audio up to a server if I understood it correctly, and finally, ideally it needs to be installed on the phones of everyone you're hanging out with.  It's a neat idea I will admit but the implementation is challenging.

 I'm so sick of these whiny kids complaining about Verizon not going live 'till the 23rd.  It's been known for weeks.  It was never a secret.  Guess what - if you want the phone, pull up your big girl panties and deal with it, folks.

 Me personally, there isn't one.  I don't use my phone for watching video.  My point was that the phone sitting with the screen turned on and otherwise not doing anything doesn't represent a useful scenario.  If someone was reading or watching a show there'd be processor activity, touchscreen activity, etc.  In this case there was none of that, which is why it is meaningless.

 Comparisons on car pricing among different countries are fallacious at best.  Tariffs can vary wildly depending on country of origin.  To say nothing of currency valuation, as you noted.  And then you have market pricing, import quantity, etc. etc.  And neither of our countries are the country of origin for the platform in this case. 




 It only comes on the BRZ Limited standard; it is an option on the Premium.  The FR-S has an entirely different spoiler (optional 2013 and 2014 base, standard 2014 Monogram, optional 2015 base).  The Release Series 1.0 2015 has a standard spoiler that is a three piece lip design, totally different from all other models in the US.  




 OP is a Canadian ;)  It'd be more of a joke if s/he didn't have winter tires.

 Yes, on an engine designed for high octane, when you use lower octane, you get less performance.  I said exactly that.  It won't hurt anything, however, which was my main point. 




 No one's sure really but when you let the clutch it faster you'll find it doesn't do it as much/at all.  But obviously that it didn't do it in the beginning means something is changing in the transmission and/or clutch. 




 First thing you should do after getting a twin is learn how to drive it so you don't have an unfortunate accident as many people new to sports cars tend to do. 




 The RS 1.0 has a body kit, lowering springs and an axleback exhaust (i.e. different muffler).  There are some other minor interior appearance things but really, that's about it.

The engine and transmission are identical to every other FR-S/BRZ. 




 It will adjust its timing for running on lower quality gas - all cars do that.  Unless you run a tune that truly requires a specific octane, all you will get from lower octane gas is lower performance. 




 The Mustang and Miata are "equally good"?  Say, wha?  If you really think that please get a Mustang as the point of a Miata or an FR-S/BRZ is in no way the same as a Mustang, aside from the moving from Pt. A to Pt. B thing. 




 Nope, it happens when shifting too slowly (well, releasing the clutch too slowly).  Cars like being shifted fast, it's actually less stressful as everything is closer to matching speeds. 




 That's this sound.

I don't think anyone is certain what it is yet, but the clutch being the thing that makes it is pretty certain.

 The crickets from the fuel pump and the AC chirp are separate things - one doesn't cause the other.  The fuel pump will be basically constant once warmed up - the AC is a periodic chirp/squeak that happens every 7-10 seconds when the AC is on or the windshield defrost is on. 




 I thought the discount was only live until the phone is paid for completely? 




 There are two chirps your car will make.  One is the high pressure fuel pump, which will be a near constant chirp/squeak once warmed up and we call crickets.  The other is the AC compressor which will chirp every 10 seconds or so when the AC is on (or front window defrost is on, as the AC is running then as well).  Both are totally normal. 




 My suggestion exactly - same on all sides and back, nothing on front.  35% is plenty dark for Nebraska. 




 Heh, yep.  Good people share this sort of info over on NASIOC ;) 




 Well my theory originally was to run the LWCP until I could afford a nice clutch/LWFW and tearing into the transmission.  However just recently a member started a survey thread about running both pulley and flywheel and there are plenty of folks who do without problem.  It's likely a combination of other mods like FI contributed to the problem, as well as being a holdover from other Subie engines (where it really was a bad thing to do).

 A Tundra, at the time.  Since then I've also had a Mercedes C350, a GMC Sierra 1500, a different Tundra and now my FR-S and my girlfriend's Hyundai Sonata.  And three different motorcycles.  And a Focus, Taurus and Corolla that were all driven by my ex-fiancee (that breakup was why the first Tundra went away as well...memories).

So yeah, I have a problem with buying vehicles heh.  I keep motorcycles the longest, till they're paid.  The GTO I owned the longest, not quite four years.  Then the first Tundra right about three. 




 Nope, disagree.  I did my research on all seasons and for the little bit of snow we get here they're ideal.  I bought the highest all-around performing all seasons as tested by Tire Rack - Hankook ventus s1 noble2s.  Working great.  Better than the stock summers in the dry as well.  I may get dedicated snows out in the future but these will more than meet my needs this season.  Especially given my ability to telework.

The last time it was on the dyno with me it was over 480whp, but that was before the intake and TB work. Through the 4L60E it was just over 600bhp.

 I figured the strut clearance thing would be an issue given the springs vice coilovers...I think most folks running that wheel are on coilovers.  Also I wasn't talking about the poke (how far the wheel sticks out) but stretch (how the tire doesn't go all the way to the edge of the rim).  I ran 245s on 8 inch wide rims on my GTO back in the day.

Enjoy your ride :) 




 That's funny - I just read through your build yesterday.  I like the new wheels.  I would've gone with narrower (or wider tires) as I'm not a big fan of the stretched look, but to each their own.

 Personally I don't think they'll end up selling it; they will however allow it on the network if you get it from Google. 




 Why is Anthony Kiedis chasing the Dynamic Duo?  He must want to give it away give it away give it away now to them or something...

 I don't take it seriously, I just understand the context, that's all.  If you want to see people taking a show seriously, head over to r/interstellar.  Fanatics over there... 




 Referring to Meechum as a security guard is a pretty harsh way to trivialize that relationship and his job...

 I see a build with today's date on it now.  invisiblek is the person who is responsible for official CM11 build so his builds of CM12 are likely to become the official one as well. 




 From invisiblek's site.  invisiblek.org 




 Not at the top level of the settings menu, no.  It it's buried somewhere I'm not aware of it. 




 Without a second thought.  If someone asked me to travel into space I'd be there in a heartbeat.

 Disable the Verizon software.  It's just there to snoop on you. 




 That they're blessed by CM rather than being produced by individual maintainers now (though generally the same folks are doing much of the active coding work).  First official builds were on the 5th of Jan.

 Yes way. :D

"One thing you won't find on the Aquos Crystal is an earpiece. For phone calls, the entire screen vibrates to produce sound. Sharp calls it a "Direct Wave Receiver," but to us it seems exactly like the bone conduction speaker technology we've seen pop up in Google Glass and a few other out-there devices. Just press it up against your head and you'll hear sound. Like a bone conduction speaker, the sound gets louder when you plug your ears, or if you press the Aquos against a pair of headphones, the sound will go right through them."

 I didn't say you did, was pointing this out for the benefit of the OP and other less knowledgeable folks.

It was changed because they're become more mainstream and don't want users getting into trouble having root enabled by default.  It just means those of us who have a clue have to do more work now. 




 Tapping the build number seven times is not unique to CM.  It's Android.  Though on CM it's where the root enable setting is now hidden. 




 This is called parking lights FYI.  In some places driving like that is illegal.  Just something to be aware of. 




 It's not a conspiracy, nor is it a theory.  It's a fact of how Facebook operates.  There is a ton of information online about how their algorithms work.  It's hardly a secret.  It kills your credibility to doubt they do it when it's full acknowledged by Facebook themselves.

I'm perfectly happy for folks who want to put themselves out there but I don't feel like putting up with ads and having my likeness used to convince my friends and family to buy things.

 I'll add, Facebook is turning the internet into a curated experience much like AOL back in the early 90s when it controlled a large portion of the experience; back then the internet was still a new thing for most consumers.  It's damaging how one entity has so much control over what people see. 




 Because I don't use Facebook; I don't have an account.  That's all.  Not a big deal...  you can make a forum thread as organized or disorganized as you want.  Facebook gets organized however Facebook wants to organize it to ensure they get paid.

 No, some of us jusr appreciate the ability of a vehicle to actually drive down the road and go around corners, that's all.  Not scrape hard parts because they hit an ant. 




 There's a plastidipped metallic purple one in Southern Maryland I've seen a few times. 




 No worries, I was just curious ;) 




 Do you plan to make a version of this build log that isn't dependent on suckbook, out of curiosity?  Say on ft86club?  I'd like to follow along... 




 As a motorcyclist and FR-S owner I just have to ask - what is considered a tank slapper in a car?  I've never encountered that language in reference to a four wheeled vehicle before.

 Yes.  Probably somewhere during 19 or 20 is when it ended.  And now I'm a well adjusted (lol) 34.5 year old.  Family and other folks passing away, last year of HS was a rollercoaster, and I too was dealing with being bi (tho at that time I was convinced I was gay).

 One of my coworkers called him Mister Who...I about died.

 I lost 82 pounds over 2008-2009 and let me tell you...That muscle your doc told you about in your buttocks, I'm still missing it.  It really only bothers me flying, so I took two of those stadium seat cushions and made a seat with a gap at the back so the seat puts no pressure there on my tailbone. 




 Good lord, 5 and 6 kids.  Where do these people live and how can I make sure I never find myself there? 




 In my experience, being friends or in regular communication with an ex is never a good thing for either party.  Move on.  You'll be better off. 




 I don't see there being another phone with this feature.  There's just no usage case that makes it worthwhile.

How do you know when a company is making profit hand over fist?  They come out with silly niche products like Samsung has here. 




 http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/25/google-io-2014-by-the-numbers/

To make the numbers easy, let's just use 1 billion total Android devices.  The OP says builds with less than 0.1% penetration are excluded.  That means, less than a million devices.  Given how the largest markets and most popular devices don't have released L builds yet...It's hardly unreasonable.  




 The point is there are more frequent accidents per capita.  One can draw the conclusion that quality here is not as good as elsewhere.  I linked the weather.com article but there were 10 more just like it referencing the same data. 




 Something seems to be keeping your phone awake a lot when you're not using it.  Do you have a bunch of apps set to auto update your feeds all the time like Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, News Plus, etc.? 




 Ad blocking, yes, need root to be effective.  Ad-Away from F-Droid market (not Play store).

Can Fb/Twitter be uninstalled/disabled in Settimgs  Apps  All?

You might want to check out /r/Android since you seem to be a new user. 




 You will always need to flash a GApps package if you're doing a clean install.  GApps is not now, has never been nor will it ever be included in CM. 




 Not so far.  Less than 2% battery drop overnight (6 hrs 45 minutes) as well. 




 GG4 was announced in mid-November.  This phone was in development since early summer at the latest, so that's why.  They're not trying to screw you, don't worry.  It takes more than a month to design, prototype, test and productionize a new item for sale on the consumer market. 




 I haven't seen either of my cousins in any way other than a Twitter profile pic in 25 years.  So it's entirely possible to not be aware of these things.

 So I'm not sure that the slidey ruler is the best way to determine how much one prefers a particular gender relative to one's own gender.  Also, it might be useful to ask how recently one had sex with same/opposite gender in addition to how often typically.  Also if one is in an LTR... 




 Up until the last few weeks it was black with a few Splendas.  Lately I've taken to adding some milk (say 3 oz in my 24 oz Contigo), which cuts the bitterness more efficiently for me. 




 No. 




 Changing a few suspension bolts and updated engine software do not make a new generation.  Every manufacturer does things like this every year.  When they redesign the HPFP so it doesn't chirp on non-Japanese fuel, THAT will be a generational change.

 First off, take a deep breath.  Second thing, go get a pregnancy test.  If she's missed a cycle then you probably know the result; HOWEVER, stress, diet, etc. can play havoc with women so it doesn't mean she is pregnant necessarily.  Then, depending on the results, consider your options.  You can find out about pro-choice help in MA here: http://www.prochoicemass.org/

 Rear fog lights are a luxury only feature in the US, typically only on Mercedes/BMW etc.  My C350 had it.  If you ever see folks driving at night and one taillight is brighter, it's because they're running the rear fog and don't realize it (on my C350 the headlight switch pulled out to turn on fogs - first detent was front and second was front and rear together).

 There's also threads over on ft86club all the time by people looking to swap trunks w/spoilers for those without... 




 And they're done this way because of past failures trying to do it all at once. 




 Plenty of folks (and there are a ton of Canadians over at ft86club.com) recommend snow tires and some weight.  A little caution goes a long way - no matter your vehicle you shouldn't be putting yourself in a situation where severe rotation is a possibility.  Modulate that throttle pedal, it's not an on/off switch. 




 OFT can do anything ECUTek can, short of auto rev match (so far).  It can be used to do dyno tuning, just like ECUTek can be used to create off the shelf tunes, which many people seem to think is the only thing an OFT can do.  And unlike ECUTek, OFT doesn't permanently modify your ECU at memory locations that can't otherwise be accessed.  Plus it's about half the price (if you buy the cable, and it doesn't look like you did).

 Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization.

I say "your" civilization because, when we began thinking for you it really became "our" civilization. 




 Ugh, tell me about it.  35 in less than 6 mos.  I used Mosaic when I was a kid.  And Simpletext for writing websites. 
























 Dollar sign goes before the number.  Also, dollar sign and USD are redundant. Just use USD.  Which also should go before the number. 




 Been doing this to me since October.  What's worse is even with no balance carried forward I get a late fee assessed.  Started after I changed plans while I was on a trip because I ran out of data (was on 1GB single line w/Edge and they moved me to 2GB single line at the same price).  This past month I got a bill credit for the inconvenience and a further assurance it's fixed.  Guess I'll see next week when my billing period resets. 




 Yeah, no kidding, but oil tends to move around inside an engine while it's operating...

Wikipedia on "Motor oil":

"In gasoline engines, the top piston ring can expose the motor oil to temperatures of 160C (320F)."

I do believe that's much hotter than 212F... 




 The diary would suggest there were plenty or right times and places that were never/haven't yet been shown to viewers.

 So what you're telling me is, Toyota/Subaru designed the FA20 to leak right above the overpipe in order to allow owners such as myself to verify I don't have a bad head gasket?  Ingenious.

 Whatever tiny bit of water is in your oil boils off when the engine is running...If there's a lot of water in your oil, you're gonna have a bad time. 




 No company cares about you (specifically) as a customer.  You are not a precious snowflake.  I don't know where people get this idea...

 Not a big reader are we...

 "Is the UIDH still present if a customer has opted-out of the advertising programs? Currently, when a customer opts out of the RMA program and is not a participant in Verizon Selects, the UIDH is present. In these circumstances the UIDH is used for the authentication purposes described above, but it cannot be used for advertising purposes because there is no information associated with the UIDH available to our ad partners. Verizon is working to automatically disable the UIDH for customers who are opted out of the RMA program or who opt out in the future. Verizon will also disable the UIDH for any customers who are ineligible to participate in these advertising programs, such as government and enterprise lines. We are in the process of making the systems changes needed to deliver these solutions, and will begin implementing modifications in locations across the country once testing is complete. Customers may opt-out of the RMA program from MyVerizon."

 OP...Best advice is maybe not to obsess about passing and just do your best.  You seem to be posting about this quite a bit this week.  Maybe take a break from it?  Maybe wait to take the test until it's a less stressful time?  I dunno.  That was almost 20 years ago now for me.  All I remember is that I made a right on red that I shouldn't have but they gave me a pass because the sign was really high up on the pole and hard to see in the vehicle I was testing in. 




 Going slow might be OK for a test situation but in the real world there are lots of places with minimum speed limits...Also, driving below the speed at which the rest of traffic is flowing can be dangerous. 




 Doesn't seem likely given there's an LG executive interviewed in this article saying they aren't ready to replace the G3 already; they also aren't announcing at MWC...

http://www.androidpit.com/lg-g4-release-date-price-specs-features

Also, I have read a lot about a 3K screen.  3K at 5.3" would be pretty silly given the success of the G3 and Note 4 at 5.5"+... 




 LG released the G3 on 17 July last year...Given it has been a phenomenal seller I don't see them replacing it this quickly.  They've only just announced the G Flex 2 afterall.

The others of course will introduce new phones at MWC in March as is pretty typical.

The M9 will very likely be the first available given it's already been out in the wild in concept form and teased online.  The M7 was announced in Feb and the M8 in March, so that's pretty in line with history.

The Z3 though was in September.  And this was hardly confirmation:  http://www.techradar.com/us/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/early-images-of-sony-xperia-z4-leak-with-a-little-help-from-007-1277841

The Galaxy S5 and S4 were both April releases after announcements at MWC in their respective years' February; since MWC is later this year than is typical it's likely the phones announced there will release later as well. 




 Thanks!  I try ;) 




 My co-workers, degrees and salary would tend to disagree but as ever, I value your insight. 




 No need to resort to name calling.  I already conceded that you know more about how my cat, who's lived with me his whole life, behaves than I do. 




 They'll be announced, but very unlikely they'll be available for purchase before summer. 




 This car doesn't have fogs.  Those are the marker lights/turn signals.  If fogs were installed they'd be in that black vent area.  Like this:

 Pub we went to in Fleet a few visits ago had a free range Mastiff.  It was glorious. 




 He's been my little buddy almost six years, and was a kitten when he joined me.  Think I know my own cat's mannerisms.

But anyway, I digress, as clearly all cats act the exact same way and have no personalities to speak of independent of instinct.  Whatever... 




 No, that's sitting at the window trying to figure out how to get at the birds eating the bird seed day just put down. 




 That isn't remotely what my cat looks like when he's about to go get something.  He gets puffed up, ears forward, shows his teeth and chits.  Sometimes he doesn't do the mouth gape bit though. 




 If you want better performance using the OEM OS isn't the way to do it.  Use CyanogenMod or another variation thereof.  The OEM will never squeeze all the performance there is out of a device because they're hamstrung by having to load their and carrier's crapware. 




 Yes, I do upgrade my PC.  I bought my last rather than do a homebuild, but since then I've upgraded storage twice (small SSD and then a larger SSD, swapping the small SSD into my bedroom HTPC), and graphics card to a newer single then an SLI configuration.  Processor, I still haven't needed as I'm just at 1080P on my living room TV and I've gotten tired of FPSs.

I certainly understand the parallels - I think though it's probably a case of a phone being much more important to some folks than they are to me, since I can't really do anything with it for work like a lot of folks seem to.

Thanks all for the explainers :)  




 But how much do these modules cost?  That's what makes the case.  It seems like a solution without a problem. 




 For those features, never.  I buy new phones for better and bigger screens typically.  If I'm listening to music it's via headphones - people who listen to devices in public over their device speakers...I find that incredibly rude. 




 FYI Cyandelta is not a Cyanogen product and is not officially supported.  The safest way to update is to use the real nightlies and make backups via recovery periodically... 




 Man, lots of water spots on the back window at 1:15...thought this was supposed to be a detailing shop? 




 Ok so...I really need for someone to explain to me the hoopla around this modular phone concept.  I seriously don't get it.  I feel like as a male age 18-49 electrical engineer I'd be the target demo but it does nothing at all for me. 




 Drier is better.  Hate hate hate goopy m c.  Also, initially undertook the noodles. 




 That was sort of exactly my point.  For one or two or a handful of beings in all the history of the universe it'd be amazing.  For everyone else, they'd never know the difference. 




 Here's the thing about that though...for 99.99999999999999999999999...% of living beings it'd be no different than our universe as it exists today. 




 Erosion due to glaciation, or so the ranger station would have one believe...

 Incomplete information is just as bad as incorrect. 




 Um, I was disagreeing with you on your statement that better materials, a dubious distinction in itself, are the biggest reason why a Porsche is more expensive than a Mustang.  I said nothing about a Mustang being better.  What costs more is the Porsche workforce in my opinion.  That and the logos on the fascia, wheels and tail.

The 911 GT3 is my dream car and I hope to get the next revision once my 2017 plan is complete.

 You can search within any site using Google...just do this - "search term" site:website.tld (you only need quotes if your search term is multiple words).  I do this all the time; works great. 




 I hate to be that guy but I really don't like this new boot animation.  First, the blinding white background (not to mention hugely inefficient for AMOLED folks); second, it makes the phone feel laggy as it slides off at the end (this is even apparent in the gif version you linked).

I replaced it after the first boot and I never want to see it again. 




 Ford managed to keep the new GT a secret up to their reveal; dunno why a phone manufacturer couldn't do the same if they tried. 




 You realize he was talking about buying both of those right, not one or the other? 




 Problem is the 2015 STs aren't out yet so it's not really a fair comparison (neither is the GTI Performance Pack). 




 220 is with perf pack; 210/258 otherwise.

For the GTI, have little feet.  It was uncomfortable working the clutch with my size 12s.  Not a lot of room between the floor and the bottom of the dash.  And the pedals were really low.

 Factory/dealer installed options, particularly with the FR-S.  Not these special models.  Let folks configure them how they want.  More color options.  Wheel options.  Stereo options.  Better quality interior like a stitched leather/alcantara dash.  A multiclutch transmission would be good but neither Toyota nor Subaru have one in production and so they'll never develop one for such a niche vehicle. 




 Realistically, that'll be years down the road.  Neither Toyota nor Subaru are exactly forward thinking when it comes to powertrains. 




 The headlights have nothing to do with the backup cam.  Both the BRZ and FR-S have near plug and play camera options.  The link below is one example (which will work with most any backup cam on the market).

 Yeah.  The bottom bolt was oily and harder to break free than the rest but I got it out.  Was afraid it was cross threaded because it was tight all the way out but it wasn't thank the car gods.  So it's take out all three bolts, use a long flathead screw driver to pry the stock plate off, clean off the mating surface with brake cleaner (and a razor blade if there's any RTV residue), dab some Permatex ultra grey on the parting lines between the cylinder and head (top and bottom), rub some oil on the new plate's gasket, then mount up the new plate and finger tighten the screws; come back after an hour and torque it to spec.  Then, let cure for 24 hours.

I'm sure it also helps that I have a lithium battery that's less than half the size of the stocker too.  Gives a lot more space to work.  Here's the new plate:

 I did the Raceseng plate install tonight.  Link below is my stock plate.  As a reminder, 2014 w/2014 build date; daily driver; naturally aspirated; about 8200 mi.

 The low resolution is really inhibiting ability to read the documents and screen but given the Einstein poster and book "Quarks" I'm going with physics student in addition to the other comments I've read.   




 Speaking as a production engineer, it's an absolutely shit thing Subaru has done with that plate.  It's a manual process with liquid materials and those are things you just don't do if they can be avoided, and it easily could've been based on the design and what was to be accomplished.  They'd have saved on labor if they had fine it with a plug and gasket, even if the parts were slightly more expensive. 




 It's actually stamped steel. 




 My daily driver naturally aspirated 2014 with 8,000 miles in it leaks from the cam plate like crazy.  But it's been too cold for me to install the Raceseng plate I bought. 




 So I'm sitting at DFW on a layover.  C terminal if you're familiar.  Anyway, there are two sets of wall plugs where I'm sitting.  Only one set works.  People keep coming up and plugging in to the bad one and their charger falls right back out.  Try again, falls out.  Try other plug, falls out.  I've seen this repeat ten times so far.  It's kind of amusing.  Mostly i devices but one BlackBerry, for those wondering.

Am I the only person with an external battery pack?  I have an LG G3 though... 




 My stock 1000RR would hit 83 in first, but I've long since geared it down.

 The outside diameter of the tire is typically kept the same when you go up or down in wheel size. So it'd fill the same amount of space in your wheel well.  It won't look any more or less like a monster truck than it does now. 




 31-33?  With an automatic maybe.  I'm sitting at just about 24 average over 8000 miles with my 6MT.

And yes, a supercharger increases volumetric efficiency so if you can stay out of the throttle you'll see the mileage go up slightly.  I experienced this on my GTO.  I actually was going to post this when I saw this thread this morning but figured some know nothing would downvote it into oblivion.  Guess I was right... 




 Why would anyone want to risk starting off the darkest timeline? 




 I just...don't even know what to say about this.  It snowed four inches overnight.  It's still snowing here.  Last week we had a night of 8 inches.  Second winter where I live and I've never seen a single person driving with chains on.  And you're doing this just in case for the one day it might snow an inch in Atlanta?  I...I don't get it? 




 Thunderstruck. 




 Exactly what I was going to suggest.  Do it with gas cylinders, water hoses, tires...escaping gas or fluid will always bubble :)  That's how I figured out one of my motorcycle tires was installed incorrectly years ago.  Lots of bubbles around the bead.  Works for gas grills, washing machines...you name it. 




 Wait, so did you get full on new headlight assemblies to in that $500?  I assumed based on the pictures you had a 10 Series or a Monogram. 




 I've been running a single exit Berk muffler delete since last May.  Yep, she's a daily driver.  But I'm deaf so it doesn't bother me one bit - I like hearing what I can of it.  Long term it's probably EL headers and an FBM single exit 3" system. 




 And that's why I haven't done it yet.  For the price you could do so many different potential performance things.  I definitely understand the appeal though. 




 That is not accurate.  There are plenty of phones that have no known exploits. 




 Let's make my 2017 plan a 2016 or heck a 2015 plan, howsabout it? 




 When did I say it was adequate?  I'm actively working to increase the horsepower of my FR-S.  But that's just what I do.  I used to have a 600 hp 04 GTO... 




 Check your PMs. 




 Um, you realize the portion of the graph that is increasing is horsepower, not torque, right?  The graph that's basically flat at 135 wtq with a dip in the 3-4.5k region is the torque graph.  That is a pretty flat torque curve.  Over 4000 RPM it varies less than 10%...Pretty much the definition of flat. 




 The torque curve is pretty much flat from 2500 to peak.  It's hardly "narrow".  It could definitely be higher for the masses though.

 Magnuson Moss protects from losing warranty - they can't just cancel it.  Contrary to what the article said.  The article was a useful brief on Ford Racing parts, nothing more.  And yes, of course the aftermarket will be better. That wasn't my point, which seems to be lost on you for whatever reason... 




 Yes, I believe that's true. 




 That's funny - I know plenty of people who survived on their stock summer tires just fine through last year's above average snow fall here in Maryland.  My FR-S on the other hand does just great on the Hankook s-1 noble 2s that I swapped to back in November from the stock Michelins. 




 I would never limit myself to OE parts.  But for those people who think changing your air filter voids your warranty, there is Ford Racing.  Or TRD, STi, AMG... 




 There are plenty of vehicles that come with summer tires.  Every Audi with a sport package, the WRX STi, Corvettes, Camaros, Mustang performance packs, Focus ST, Fiesta ST, all Porsches, the Genesis Coupe...basically any sports or sporty car. 




 They all have different wheels as well... 




 http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/buying-maintenance/news/a24602/ford-racing-really-wants-you-to-mod-ecoboost-engines/

You were saying something about no warranty? 




 Release Series is yellow... 




 What's "a normal car"?  The twins, like any other two wheel drive car, do just fine when equipped with tires appropriate for the weather and when they're not tracking through snow or water deeper than the front bumper... 




 Sounds like either you are running too low an offset or you need an alignment or both. 




 That car was actually made by the owner of streetfx... 




 This can happen with extreme drops (or lifts, actually) on any vehicle.  Keep it around an inch and you'll be fine. 




 I have Swift Sport springs coming for my FR-S.  I did get the BRZ model though, part number ending in 12.  One inch drop, substantially higher spring rates but still appropriate for stock struts based on my reading.  I wanted RCE yellows originally but couldn't justify the substantial extra cost, and the Swifts will allow a bit more tailwagging action than the RCEs (though will be much more surefooted than stock).

I got the BRZ version for the higher front spring rate - the FR-S version front/back ratio was only marginally higher than stock and I did want to add more stability. 




 Yes, but there's a difference between offering full service and there being a state law forbidding regular folks from pumping their own, as in Oregon and New Jersey. 




 After reading the comments I feel like I must be the only person here without a positive response.  Why exactly do you need a brand new sportscar as a sophomore or junior in college without (guessing since you mentioned parents) the means to pay for it on your own? 




 Why is this a surprise?  It's no different than lowering the resolution on a desktop PC before loading up a poorly done console port... 




 You can also do full custom dyno tuning with OFT just like with any other tuner.  The OFT in that case just acts as the interface to get the tune into the car, like the ECUTek cable.  But unlike ECUTek you can go back later and modify OFT tunes on your own.  ECUTek doesn't allow the enduser to do that. 




 I saw this yesterday too.  The 70% off thing is a scam.  The manufacturer sells this thing direct for $22; not whatever ridiculous before price Newegg has posted. 




 You did a great job.  Once the weather warms up here I'm planning on doing a metallic gunmetal on my stock wheels.  I think it'll look good against the white body and be different from the usual flat black. 




 What size spacers are you running?  Looks good. 




 Never owned a Mustang.

The whole point of there being a law though means you have to be willing to stand up for yourself rather than just roll over and accept the warranty being cancelled.  Otherwise the law has no power.  Of course some huge company will try to tell a consumer is wrong.  It's up to the consumer to fight back though.  Because companies don't give a damn about individual customers. Never have, never will.

If you're not willing to fight for your rights then you don't deserve them. 




 Yeah and with our luck it'll be in an Accord 




 Been modding cars for 11 years...hasn't happened yet. 




 Purple nurple! 




 Protip: revisit how warranties get voided.  It's not an automatic thing, and there are federal laws to help consumers.  Also, only an FR-S RS 1.0 ever cost over $30K. 




 Correct, it is not yet confirmed. 




 Civic will be much more expensive - the Si is in the same ballpark price wise.  The Miata only overlaps slightly - the majority of folks are buying them for top down weekend GTing, not for modding and autoX. 




 I find it amusing the people who think Scion has a boy racer image and Subaru doesn't.  WRX STi with the 12" tall wing on the back, hello?  You people that are so concerned about what others think of you that you let it dictate what kind of car you drive - I feel sorry for you.

 To answer your main question, anything that fits a 2013 will fit a 2014 and vice versa.

 Alignment looks fine but then again the pic's not dead on.

The window seals on the the Twins aren't the greatest so it probably doesn't apply that much pressure. 




 The only problem is, when it returns to freezing temps later this week, all that water that seeped past your window seals and down into the inside-outside of your doors will freeze your window motors right up until it warms up again.

It also happens when you reprogram the car with updated tunes (but you didn't mention anything about that). 




 Did you disconnect the battery while you were doing the change? 




 Yes, it is.  Saw it there after Boxerfest two weekends ago.  Didn't have a transmission yet. 




 Sell the phone on eBay and use it to pay off the contract? 




 The camo pattern and the bar are so close together it was hard for me to initially tell.  I'm still not 100% sure either way. 









 Agree.  Reflections don't match and while the other pipes cast shadows on the ceiling, the ones holding the tanks don't. 




 Good luck...I've had an absolute hell of a time trying to sell mine.  Between people trying to low ball and getting jerked around by scammers who don't show up to prearranged meetings, I'm about ready to just donate them and write them off. 




 Sounds pretty meaty.  I like it.  Are you all stock ahead of the overpipe (header, intake, etc.)? 




 To whomever downvoted me - it's nice that you are either pro-LGBT or antigun.  You have that right.  But you have to look at the whole picture.  Increased funding for schools (taxes).  Increased welfare (taxes).  Against immigration reform.  The only thing the guy has going for him is that he's pro-LGBT and pro-choice.

Why can't we have a candidate who'll just live and let live, so to speak?  You know, a Libertarian. 




 You almost had me, but he's totally for gun control.  This is why you can't be a single issue voter.

Also, the guy is a lifelong politician.  First campaign in 1972?  He's 73!   




 Holy hell that's fast.  Best I've ever done was 38 and that was pretty awesome. 




 It's Lake Bled in Slovenia.  I've been there :) 




 Yes, because more than half of all marriages don't end in divorce *rolls eyes* 




 Oh come now, shouldn't it be Hamsters and Wolverines? 




 So that car we saw at Boxerfest and then later it showed up to the afterparty/dyno day at Pure Auto.  The louvers look really good on the car in motion.  Stupid, stupid expensive though.   




 The LS2 is in a different vehicle now.  I had some pics of it too but just the engine bay.  When I dropped my car off for springs I go to hear it running.  Reminded me of my former GTO *sniff*. 




 It didn't have a transmission installed in it yet.  So, no.  The other car with the dyno sheet taped to the front made 588rwhp though; that was an FA20 with a Full Blown turbo kit.

There were several people joking though that the turbo wasn't big enough because folks could fit their hands between it and the fuse box.

In addition to the green one there were actually three 2JZ Supras, an old Cressida with a 2JZ swap and a 240SX with an SR20DETT (I think; I'm not as familiar with Nissans).  And an R32 Skyline GTR.  And a new GTR, a ZR1, a C6 Z06... 




 The 86 platform vehicles come either as a manual or a traditional automatic (torque converter).  Having paddles does not make them "semi-automatic" or a DCT/MCT.  Many automatic transmission vehicles come with paddles these days.  That's not to say the transmission isn't good, though.  You will however notice a significant difference due to the lower gearing of the automatic and the rear end used in the automatic cars (which is why they also get substantially better gas mileage than the manual).  




 I used to be.  I got rid of Facebook a few months ago. 




 Lem: Oh, my God. Maybe we're evil scientists.
Phil: (laughing manically) I'm sorry. I laugh like that when faced with an unpleasant truth. That's why I got thrown out of that Al Gore movie.

 If we weren't talking about something that only happened a few years ago, I'd agree with you.  But we're talking about 18 year olds who bullied/were bullied earlier in their teen years.  Class reunion time another 10 years down the line is the time for reconciliations.  Right now, they've both still got an absolute ton of growing up to do.  Not that I disagree with OP's sentiment in any way. 









 Ah hahahahahahahahahaha.  Live your life for a bit and then get back to us.

 Love that the first comment to the post is a CF'er.  









 Easy.  Pilot ID becomes RFID enabled and the lock is no longer controlled by a person. 




 I've always enjoyed Carcassonne. 




 Have one also, grey tinted Classic Check. 




 Good news everyone!  I mean, good luck! 




 Yep, I have a turn I take coming home that is a greater than 90 degree right hander - not quite a U-turn but nearly.  Nannies normal on stock tires they cut in hard but VSC in Sport I can execute a very graceful drift (under the speed limit with a green light and no pedestrians or cross traffic to yield to, of course). 




 Been watching this on wunderground all week.  Forecast kept going back and forth between snow and rain here in MD but settled on rain. 




 No. 




 No. 




 That's because a 225/40-18 is half an inch bigger in diameter than the stock 215/45-17.  A 225/35 would've been .4 inches smaller.  OP did about the best he could do, but I'd have gone smaller personally.  That combo probably weighs a ton more than stock given XXRs and Chinese tires. 




 You didn't get enough baggies.  I only see two boxes. 




 Did you take the stickers off your side windows or were they rolled down?  Can't tell with the beer goggles on the camera haha.  You are the guy from Bakersfield right? 




 No, no they don't.  But yes, it was.  Back when there was precipitation that regularly fell from the sky, anyway. 




 I had a salesman tell me the BRZ was a turbo and had AWD while he was showing to to me.  This was in Annapolis if anyone is wondering.  It doesn't matter the brand - there are know-nothings just trying to put money in the bank in every showroom. 




 Cb is a special edition only, supposed to appeal to women or some such BS; it's not a facelift.  




 And I see no one actually answered your question, so I will.  The Monogram was a 2014 only deal and they were "limited" production.  Plenty to be found on lots still but they are all leftovers at this point.  However, Scion being Scion you can look forward to a new special edition each model year with pretty good certainty.

2013 - Sc10n Series /// 
2014 - Monogram /// 
2015 - Release Series 1.0 (FR-S) / Series.Blue (BRZ) /// 
2016 - ...?  Whatever it is I can assure you it won't be a convertible or have a turbo contrary to what blogs you may read. 




 Ok, well, go have a seat over there and think about what you've done and how you'll make it up to her. 




 Are you wiring up the rear fog as a brake light, is that the idea (the central red reflector in the bumper on US vehicles is the rear fog in other countries)? 




 And they've done the same on the new GT3 RS.  It also is the first serial production car with a magnesium roof - even lighter than carbon fiber. 




 Between LWCP, LWFW and DS you're taking about 25 lbs out of the car.  Look at it that way. 




 I looked at it from the perspective of taking four pounds (I have the Raceseng) off the very front of the car - not so much for the rotating mass benefit but the improvement to the polar moment of inertia and CG of the vehicle (between the stock muffler-single delete and spare/tool removal that's almost 60 lbs off the extreme rear of the car).  Balancing that in the engine bay is harder and more expensive but every little bit helps.  Up front I did the pulley for -4 lbs and LiFePO4 batt for -26 lbs but I also did Grimmspeed MC brace, STB and intake for a gain of around 4-5 lbs.  Net change up front then is -25 lbs give or take. 




 Carbon DS is actually smaller diameter so it has less chance of interference with whatever exhaust you might run.  But they cost basically 2x as much.  Both AL and CF are significantly lighter than stock though. 




 I can totally appreciate being away and wanting to get right in it but dude, let her warm up first.  Foreplay before the main event.  Revving a cold engine is about the worst thing you can possibly do... 




 On this platform that's called a front pipe.

Header - overpipe - front pipe - catback (midpipe - axleback)

Do you have the single or dual Berk?  I have a single but exhaust is otherwise stock so far. 




 Understand.  Many car companies do though.  They care a lot.  They don't want to be fined or forced to leave the marketplace. 




 All eggs smell sulfur-y to me.  To this day I can only eat scrambled.  My girlfriend is a big time foodie and thinks I'm nuts.  *sigh*  




 Try almost 800 lbs heavier...

 Also, a loaded Accord V6 MT coupe weighs 3528 lbs.  So carting around an extra 800 lbs it needs the torque.

 At which point you install winter tires and continue about your business.  Which you should do for FWD, RWD, or AWD anyway. 




 No.  And a TSB is not a recall - a TSB basically is, if the customer complains about X, do this.  There've actually been 3 or 4 different TSBs for the HPFP.  However, this guy is really making a much bigger deal of it than it is. 




 Humanity made it to where we are today just fine without all that crap.  Don't let Fisher Price define your lifestyle dude. 




 Have you ever driven a V6 Mustang, same year as yours?  Ford heavily touted performance with that first ever 300 HP V6 marketing nonsense, but transmission and gearing were setup to be all about that em pee gee. 




 To your point, it's also not the place for people who don't own one. 




 I dunno, crashing through a k-rail off an overpass and falling to the ground 20 feet below would probably be kind of a little worse than ending up in a ditch... 




 A sleeper that sounds like a NASCAR is only a sleeper to a deaf person.  There should basically be no way to tell until you scream away from a starting line (you'll note I didn't say stoplight). 




 In the dipyourcar.com vids they always recommend spraying pretty thick out onto the tire to allow it to peel cleanly.  If it won't, you might not be spraying thick enough or uniform coats over the wheel. 




 Good on ya.  Also, digging the red flaps.  I run the same on my white FR-S. 




 I disagree.  Yes, better traction makes the rear step out less, but as you grow in competence as a driver it means the limits are being raised.  Which allows for further improvement.  Driving at the limit on a closed course can be more fun than drifting at 15MPH, believe me. 




 Stahlbus drain plug.  Don't need to prop your bike up that way. 




 Surely you mean ex-friend; alternatively, frenemy or nemesis? 




 Looks like setting to allow disabling was merged today.  Should be in nightlies tomorrow or the next day I'd guess...

 Haha yeah that also works, ye olde Dee Em Vee.  Enjoy the new ride, and make sure you keep an eye out for stray lightposts when you're drifting through your parking lots.  They'll jump right out at you when you least expect it. 




 Honestly, no.  BUT, previous to the intake I was already OFT tuned Stage 1 93 octane, running an aFe panel filter and Mishimoto intake hose, LWCP, LiFePO4 battery, no spare, Berk single exit muffler delete, so the gain from the new full intake and revised OFT tune are probably lost in the noise. 




 Ah, see here on the mainland we refer to that as the Eastern Shore no matter how far north/south you are to avoid that sort of confusion ;)

 I've got the Grimmspeed.  I don't really notice any specific sounds from it.  I'm not the best judge though, as I have no muffler, no hood mat among other things. 




 When you're first learning, you complete braking before turn in and then accelerate once you reach the apex.  As you get on in experience, you will brake to the apex and accelerate at the apex/out of the turn.  You want to brake smoothly so that you settle the suspension going into the turn.  The braking forces will give the wheels turning - the front - slightly more traction, which is good for turn in.

The stock suspension setup is biased such that the rear will be loose in turns - hence those big drifts.  This is on any of the three 86s, but the FR-S is setup the most that way.  The BRZ and GT86 less so.
