 This article gives a pretty good explanation of the study:

http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2013/06/low-doses-of-psilocybin-help-extinguish-conditioned-fear.html 




 Re-posted to correct misspelling in title. Here's the original paper: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am401956s 









 Oh, and here's the original paper: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am401956s. 




 Misspelling in title: There should be a "try" between "to" and "some." But your brain probably filled in the gap anyways. Isn't that crazy? 
























 Meh, I'd let the mods decide. Cheers, mate. 




 I agree with a lot of what you're saying, but one thing to also keep in mind is that the experts that you contact will also likely have "agendas and biases," especially if you speak with competing scientists.  




 There's also a great article here when this paper was originally linked to Reddit in June:

http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1fslo3/low_doses_of_psilocybin_speed_the_removal_of/ 




 Pretty sure the subjects only did it once. 




 TL;DR of the study:

 Yep. The study was also conducted in vitro, so that could also affect the results. 

What's really interesting here is that short-term exercise produced the hormonal changes with inhibitory effects on cancer cell growth. A previous study showed long-term exercise to have such an effect: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11490320.  



















 Here's the actual paper. It's open-access over at Scientific Reports: http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130625/srep02066/full/srep02066.html 


































 The piece is based on a recent study from the Scripps Research Institute that looked at cocaine addiction in a rat model. 









 I don't put much stock in computer simulations, but this is quite a provocative theory that makes some intuitive sense. 









 Yep. And according the the article, the researchers were working with low doses of psilocybin in a controlled environment. Self-medicating in an uncontrolled environment with higher doses may not be effective at all, and may instead be deleterious.  



















 Yep! I'm super pumped. 




 In general, science television today is but a shadow of a shadow of its former self. There are a few bright spots of course, like Planet Earth, Mythbusters, and Bill Nye, but for the most part, anything on Science Channel or Animal Planet is garbage.

I just finished watching Carl Sagan's Cosmos for the first time and was blown away.

 The researchers found that when they deactivated the macrophages, the salamanders healed in the same way other animals do: scabs and scars, but no new limbs

Thus, by process of elimination, they've found that macrophages are key to regeneration. It will be even trickier to find out why. 


































 Surprised to see that my hometown TV station made it on r/science. The last time they made worldwide news was for their drunk anchor. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2071669/Annie-Stensrud-Was-bumbling-news-anchor-drunk-air-Female-presenter-slurs-words-bizarre-broadcast.html 









 What's he doing at a World Wrestling Entertainment event? 




 One has to wonder about the multitude of ways that sports subtly affect our psyches and actions. The article mentioned that sports defeats also boost chances of traffic fatalities and domestic violence... eeek!  









 100% positive feedback: sounds like a responsible mother. 









 So rigid, methodical, and uninspired... but enough about the current state of scientific publishing. 



















 So many people carry around hatred and contempt after being wronged. The accompanying worry and anxiety must feel like a 20lb weight on each shoulder. You don't have to forget -- justice should be done in those circumstances. But forgiveness is the true liberation. 









 Technically correct. Though with male animals, vets almost always remove the testicles: simple, cheap, effective.

The downside is that your male cat won't be cooling its balls on the base of toilets. 









 If fusion reactions don't become self-sustaining, how do you explain stars? 




 NIF began focused on achieving fusion ignition and it still is. But they've missed so many deadlines over there that it seems they're starting to "diversify their research portfolio," so to speak -- taking on all sorts of projects.

I mean, that HUGE laser has to be used for something! 




 NIF's biggest problem is being able to sustain and control the fusion reaction. Judging by the article it doesn't seem that fusion ignition occurred, where the reaction actually becomes self-sustaining. In other words, I'm guessing that they didn't reach the break even point, if they did, that would be the headline.

 This study was released almost two months ago and already appeared on /r/science. I love how Scientific American simply slapped on a misleading headline and republished it. 









 Looks like they compared the subjects' final fitness scores/metrics to baseline metrics taken at the beginning of the program. Not sure if sedentary controls are really needed for a study of this design. 



















 STUNNER! 














 Here's a link to the research that I think the author is referencing:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23759244

Psychobiotics: A Novel Class of Psychotropic.

Abstract: Here, we define a psychobiotic as a live organism that, when ingested in adequate amounts, produces a health benefit in patients suffering from psychiatric illness. As a class of probiotic, these bacteria are capable of producing and delivering neuroactive substances such as gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin, which act on the brain-gut axis. Preclinical evaluation in rodents suggests that certain psychobiotics possess antidepressant or anxiolytic activity... 














 One time I ripped my boxers deadlifting and mistook it for an anal blowout. For the thirty minutes before I noticed that they were ripped, I was scared shitless that my colon would start leaking out of my arsehole. 









 Whoops, damn my brain. A billion billion is still less than 10^32, though! ;) 




 Only a billion years? Pffft. The proton can live for up to 10^32 years! 









 This study is interesting in that people commonly perceive cities as more dangerous due to higher crime and homicide rates -- we fear what we can't control. But in reality, the risk of injury death is higher outside of cities. 









 One findings that was surprising about this study was that people were least likely to intervene when the conflict was between a man and a woman. Those fights are often of a different nature, I suppose. 




 Yes, here are a couple.

I'd wager this might impart small boosts to bone density, but as far as increasing aerobic capacity or losing weight, the effects will most likely be negligible.

 Found a terrific study in PubMed:

**Lifetime exercise and disk degeneration: an MRI study of monozygotic twins.**

Study: "...the effects of power sports were investigated in 12 discordant [twin] pairs (2,300 vs 200 h of weightlifting). The age range of the twins was from 35 to 69 yr.

Finding: Increased power sport participation was associated with slightly greater disk degeneration in the lower thoracic spine, but not in the lumbar spine.

 This press release is terribly written.

Something to remember: Not all fat is created equal. Visceral fat, which coats internal organs in the abdominal cavity, is far more dangerous than subcutaneous fat, which is stored just underneath the skin. It doesn't look like the study made any effort to differentiate the two.

Addition: Yowzers. Nobody seems to like this comment. Here's information to back up what I'm saying. From the Harvard Medical School:

"Abdominal, or visceral, fat is of particular concern because its a key player in a variety of health problems  much more so than subcutaneous fat, the kind you can grasp with your hand. Visceral fat, on the other hand, lies out of reach, deep within the abdominal cavity, where it pads the spaces between our abdominal organs."

 TL;DR

http://www.realclearscience.com/journal_club/2013/10/16/why_do_we_elect_attractive_politicians_106724.html 




 Exactly. We've always known that muscles atrophy after disuse -- muscle is physiologically expensive for the body to maintain. What's incredible is how fast the body does away with them. 




 Precisely. I don't think people have to worry about wasting away from just days off at the gym. 




 Here's an interesting new study:

"Substantial skeletal muscle loss occurs during only 5 days of disuse."
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24168489

What did the researchers do?

"Twenty-four healthy, young (231 y) males were subjected to either 5 (n=12) or 14 (n=12) days of one-legged knee immobilization using a full leg cast."

What did they find?

"Quadriceps muscle CSA declined from baseline by 3.50.5 (P0.0001) and 8.42.8% (P0.0001), leg lean mass was reduced by 1.40.7 (P=0.07) and 3.10.7% (P0.01), and strength decreased by 9.02.3 (P0.0001) and 22.92.6% (P0.0001) following 5 and 14 days of immobilization, respectively."

The takeaway: It's amazing how fast muscles atrophy after only five days of total disuse! 



















 58% approval is nothing to scoff at, though. Polls never reached anywhere near that in the 60s, as far as I know. 



















 RealClearScience actually interviewed the author of the paper. (Link: http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2013/10/40-years-of-government-nutrition-data-may-be-flawed.html)

Here's what he said about the Coca-Cola funding: "Archer explained that it's an unrestricted research grant. In other words, the soft drink maker contractually has no input or say in what he researches or publishes."

I actually think that Coca-Cola wouldn't like the findings of the paper, because it's actually saying that people eat MORE calories than they think. Hmm now I wonder where those calories come from... soda maybe?
 









 For all those people eating paleo diets thinking to themselves that calories in vs. calories out doesn't matter, this study reported that obese people UNDERESTIMATED their intake by about 800 calories a day. So the largest individuals in society are actually eating a lot more. Thus -- if true -- the results of this study seem to further reinforce the USDA's general stance on obesity, that we just need to eat less and exercise more.

Study is here, btw: http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0076632

 Haha. I wonder if that's actually true? MOAR RESEARCH PLZ, SCIENTISTS! 







































 Seemed to me like the author did a decent job of summing up the research and then applying a critical, skeptical mindset to the results, which any decent science journalist should do.

Any scientific research is limited in scope in some fashion, but the point of comparing a one-off study like this to prior research is to give perspective. Sure, maybe the prior research had some limitations, but a whole lot of it also seemed to have reached the opposite conclusion as the current study, which is very important to know! 








































































































 The results of this study really aren't surprising. If teens start using nicotine before adulthood, they're more likely to crave nicotine throughout their lives. Prior research has demonstrated that brain development is altered with nicotine use. 

A major limitation of the study to keep in mind: "The studys cross-sectional nature didnt allow the researchers to identify whether most youths initiated with conventional cigarettes or e-cigarettes."

That's a pretty big drawback. 









 Fooled a lot of people:

"That is so dope but did you filter that or something? Looks almost too good haha"

 Fantastic! 



















 Taco Bell... breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

But in all honesty, [this](http://www.gastro.org/patient-center/digestive-conditions/gas-in-the-digestive-tract#Foods%20 %20Gas) guide from the American Gastroenterological Association lists foods like cauliflower, brussels sprouts, dried beans, broccoli, cabbage, bran, dairy, and fructose. Sounds like a lot of vegetarian diets are probably high-flatulogenic.  




 You're right to be skeptical. The picture the article paints is somewhat bleak. But there's a tinge of hopefulness at the end. 


































 Studies like these prompt a lot of boneheaded, insensitive comments, which attract the ~~sharks~~ amazing and awesome mods. :D
