 I feel the way every time i hear someone talking about the Constitution and original intent. 




 I read an interview with Frank Zane a while back. He talked how he would always look in the mirror and see something else to work on and improve, never being satisfied. This is a guy who had what is widely considered one of the most developed physiques of all time, was at the top of the bodybuilding world, and he was never really comfortable with his body even in his prime. Yeah, thats something that can keep you driven in that kind of competitive environment but there is also something really dysfunctional about it.  I think about that sometimes to keep things in perspective.

 Torres defense is bullshit.  He may have lined that hit up while Hossa had possession but after the poke check Hossa had time to turn, locate the puck, and take 2 strides. You cant tell me Torres didnt have time to try and avoid contact.  It was late and he clearly launched himself.  Torres was a dirtbag with Vancouver and hes a dirtbag now.

The right rules are in place to stop hits like this. The refs and the league should be embarrassed that there was no call.
 




 Hes articulating something I think about fairly regularly. Im not a Christian, Im not an atheist either. I consider myself more of a Panenthiest but I sympathize with a lot of the arguments that are made by atheists. However, I have a real problem with the way a lot of atheists approach religious people or religion in general as if there are no distinctions to be made between a everyday religious belief and the most egregious examples of fundamentalist insanity.

 Garth is probably right on this.  Start building muscle first. Take your time and get your routine sorted out. The added muscle will increase your at rest metabolism and make it easier to shed the fat over the long term. Do all the little things that boost your metabolism and get the fat burning going while you are getting bigger. Drink tons of water, eat small high protein meals every 2 to 3 hours, cardio in the morning if possible.  









 Ill throw down a hundy that says natural causes is a euphemism for in his closet, dick in hand, surrounded by pictures of Reagan, with an extension cord around his neck like David Carradine. 




 Ebionites. Couldnt think of it earlier. They were early Christians who insisted that Jesus was just a man. The messiah, but just a man. 




 The synoptics are also propagandistic, written by men familiar with Jewish scripture to convince Jewish communities of the day that Jesus was the promised messiah. Performing wonders, especially wonders associated with classic Jewish symbols of divine authority fits with that idea. Saying that performing wonders means Jesus was God still seems like a leap to me. While Jesus was certainly an apocalyptic preacher and taught of an impending judgment by the son of man it is not until the later gospels that  he claims to be this figure. There was an enormous amount of diversity of opinion in the early Christian world as to the nature of Jesus.  Just as a couple examples, some Gnostic communities believed Jesus and the Christ to be two wholly separate entities where Jesus was simply a temporary vessel for this divine spirit which abandoned him at the crucifixion causing him to cry out father why have you forsaken me. Others believed Jesus became the Christ only at his crucifixion. Others, somewhat later, said it was at his baptism. Still later, he was born the Christ.  There is a theological progression in the ancient texts building toward the idea of Jesus as man and God. But it is not fully articulated until nearly a century after his death and not settled as a point of dispute between Christian communities until several centuries after that(if it has truly been settled at all). Start with the earliest Gospel Mark, then Mathew, then Luke, then John and read them horizontally, the progression becomes quite pronounced. 




 How about Mathew, Mark and Luke? We dont get any explicit references to the divinity of Jesus until John which was written much later. And just to clarify Im not saying that they state he was not divine, Im just saying that they dont say that he WAS divine. It just seems like a pretty important point to omit given the centrality of the claim to later Christian beliefs.

 One of my favorite tony twist moments, I dont remember the year but Its opening game of the season.

Youre on a pace to score 82 goals!

 I see it as a cultural construct; a place to put the others who dont belong.  Hell was invented by people who were very sure they were not going there.

Unless you're willing to accept double predestination I don't think you can reconcile the christian concept of grace with the existence of hell. The Biblical support for the idea of hell is dicey at best.

 STAG 




 "1) Are all American war dead heroic because, if nothing else, they had the courage to volunteer for service knowing they might ultimately give their life for their country? That seems heroic to me. But if they're all heroes, does it follow that everyone in the military is a hero? Why is dying necessary? And if everyone who volunteers is a hero, what about the guys who would go AWOL if sent to fight, or who assault their commanding officer, or who run away in combat? What about the ones who are dishonorably discharged? Was Bradley Manning a hero? Had Lynndie England died in Iraq, would she have been a hero? 

2) What about people who volunteer for foreign armed forces? Are they all heroic? Or does it depend upon their country? If an American helping to liberate Libya would've been a hero had he died in action, shouldn't the Germans from NATO engaged in the same conflict be heroes too? What about the Islamic fundamentalists fighting alongside NATO? Heroes?  

3) What about the morality of the cause? Does anyone think brave Nazi soldiers during the World War II era were heroes? How about the soldiers in Stalin's army? Does the nature of the mission matter, so that a Soviet soldier who died liberating a death camp was a hero, whereas another who died while ravaging German civilians he was ordered to take revenge upon isn't? There's this reality to confront: if bestowing the title hero has nothing to do with the rightness or wrongness of the cause or mission, we'll have to grant the honorific to individuals who took part in deeply immoral acts... and yet, if the mission does matter, do we really want to deny the heroism of a GI who jumped on a grenade to save his platoon, even if we think the platoon's presence in country X was immoral? It's a confounding choice. 

4) Speaking of jumping on grenades, isn't "hero" often invoked in common parlance as if it means even more than serving and dying? For example, when we hear someone described as "a World War II hero," don't we expect that he did more than fall overboard and drown en route to the D-Day invasion? Don't we assume from that adjective that he undertook some dangerous mission, or distinguished himself in combat, like the younger Bailey brother in It's a Wonderful Life? Were the average American to watch From Here to Eternity, would he or she call Robert E. Lee Prewitt a hero?

5) And say, for the sake of argument, that all American war dead are heroes, strictly defined, but that the word and its emotional resonance is being manipulated by advocates of an imprudent war. Is it better to give soldiers an honorific they deserve, consequences be damned, or to withhold an honorific they deserve to prevent future soldiers from needlessly dying?"

 Religions are cultural linguistic expressions of our ancestors view of the human condition; what it is to be born and grow from childhood to adolescence to adulthood; to enter old age and die.  They are mechanisms through which wisdom traditions gain traction in and are transmitted through history.  A wisdom tradition is concerned with how should we live?  This is a question that science does not ask and cannot answer.   




 First, Term limits are just as likely to remove someone competent as they are to remove someone incompetent(honest as corrupt, etc).  

Second, Parliamentary bodies like congress have enormously complex procedural structures that lawmakers have to navigate to accomplish anything that want to accomplish.  Its inefficient, but its the nature of the beast. By term limiting out long time legislators you remove the people who maintain the bodys institutional memory. Which is to say that you get rid of the people who know how to do stuff.  New legislators will need to know how to do stuff so they will turn to those people outside the institutional body who are not term limited who know how the body works.  So you are actually conferring more power to Lobbyists and special interest groups over the legislative process. 

Last, by creating a set amount of time that someone can serve you remove the incentive for lawmakers to develop long term relationships and further polarize the body, making it more combative and generally less likely for that body achieve a compromise. 

The goal has to be getting *better* legislators. Term limits just get us *different* legislators.
 




 Wore JNCOs... I feel shame 




 Only according to your arbitrary definition of what constitutes divine revelation.  Outside of that narrow view your litmus test is useless.  Its not as if there is one universally agreed upon approach to which all faith traditions adhere.  

Fundamentalists make up a solid percentage of practicing Christians in the united states but they only represent a tiny sliver of Christian thought. The theological implications of divine revelation are broad and vary greatly across history, communities and individuals.  To simply assume that divine revelation must mean that one would have knowledge of the physical universe unavailable otherwise is shortsighted and intellectually dishonest. Just check out the revelation [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation). That just a small sampling and here is no shortage of approaches.

I wouldnt say Im convinced of atheism  Im agnostic. Im really comfortable saying I dont know. Agnosticism seems to me like the honest neutral position. The atheist insistence that one must find evidence in the natural world for the super natural strikes me as a self-refuting.  




 Claims of divine revelation or divine inspiration dont necessitate the expectation of scientific accuracy. It sounds like you are referring to biblical literalism or biblical inerrancy which are a completely different.  

Look, You don't have to argue like Pat Robertson is across the table from you.  Im not even Christian. I dont think the bible is divine anything, I think its an entirely human product. It tells us what our spiritual ancestors thought not what god thinks. 

At the risk of being overly broad and simplistic, it breaks down like this. There are two basic understandings of contemporary Christianity. Call them liberal and conservative for lack of better vocabulary. Both are the result of Christianitys collision with the enlightenment.   One is a defensive rejection of enlightenment knowledge (conservative), the other is a discerning integration of enlightenment knowledge(liberal). But its important to realize that both understandings are recent. Phrases like literally true or biblical inerrancy arent first uttered until the second half of 1600s and didnt become common until the 1800s.  

The idea that its dishonest for beliefs held by the community, literal or otherwise, to change based on new information is just ridiculous. To what other belief system would we apply such a standard? Why would we expect Christianity or its theology to be static? They dont exist in a vacuum, they are dynamic,  they grow and evolve and respond to history. Of course some literally held beliefs have been cast aside. Others have been invented from practically nothing (Trinity anyone?)This is the nature of ideas, the nature of culture and language.  That doesnt invalidate the entire tradition.

Look, I think the fundamentalist need to press their faith into sciences conceptual mold so that they can walk around with some  self deceived certainty about god and the universe diminishes their own tradition and is destructive to society. Yeah, ancient people believed stuff we know to be wrong (if only they had the benefit of your 17 years on the earth -just a guess-) Yeah some people, out of some sense of obligation to what they think they are supposed to believe about the bible or pure good ole fashioned stupidity, still believe some of those same things.  

Im not sure everyone gets it, maybe cry about it some more.
 




 I dont need a get out of disproof free card if proof in the scientific sense is not a standard to which I aspire.   An ancient cultures pre-scientific cosmology isnt correct so? Why would we expect it to be? And unless someone is using that as the basis for a public policy argument -in which case I will stand right beside you as we tell them to fuck off- why should we care?

BTW Genealogies are incredibly common in oral traditions. Usually as a way of keeping a family or tribal history but often as a way to confer or denote authority to a particular figure in a narrative.

Did you read Ops link? The kind of debate you are trying to engage in is part of what its talking about.
 




 I sympathize with alot of the arguments made by new-atheists but it feels like they are stuck on a single plane. I want to engage but it all seems so conceptually shallow I just end up whistling right passed. 
"metaphors aren't true therefore they are lies" and it kind of stops there. 




 You're right about this. Thanks for this thread.

 I just think King spends so much time in the characters head that it makes it really tough to communicate all the important parts of a story visually. Which is probably why Shawshank is arguably the best King adaptation;  It's not terribly long and there is a narrator.    

Apart from that can we just say, "do whatever Frank Darabont does."  




    My experience tells me that the average person and redditor only gets half the facts, half correct (both theists and atheists) because s/he doesn't bother too much on reading about them. That's why it's common to find fundamentalists refusing to "believe that we descend from monkeys" and many atheists half-assessing the ideas that inspired religious thought.    

I think its more than just ignorance.   I think a lot of atheists fall into the same kinds of fundamentalisms as the religious.  I know the defense but atheism is the absence of belief, we cant be fundamentalist. True enough if someone is just an atheist. But once you move beyond the absence of a belief into declaring an affirmative vision of the universe I know the true nature of reality then youre a Naturalist, Scientist, Materialist, etc. As such you can fall prey to the same structurally flawed kinds of assumptions usually associated with religious fundamentalism. 
Some of the questions from OP are truly Large Conceptual Stuff and have been around for centuries (what is god? What is his relation to the universe? Is it embedded in its creation? Does it "embue" his creation with divinity? With purpose?...). I get why concepts like these are hard to get and very easily misunderstood, but anyone who claims to be a (free-)thinker worth his value, owes to himself to read and understand many points of view before arriving to any kind of conclusion

Agreed. Are you familiar with Joseph Campbell? He who thinks he knows, doesn't know. He who knows that he doesn't know, knows. For in this context, to know is not to know. And not to know is to know.   




 Good call. omnipresence and a pantheistic god aren't the same thing

My experience on reddit has been that a lot of atheists have a hard time with the larger conceptual stuff.  My guess is that its because they spend so much time focused on the superficial anthropomorphized god of fundamentalists.

 Picking some hyper literalist branch of Christianity and arguing from their view is a cop out.  If its the divinity that you cant stomach then cut it out all together.   Think about it Christianity  as a sociological phenomenon and start there.  
All religions are  born out cultural linguistic traditions. If they are around long enough they become cultural linguistic traditions unto themselves.  In philosophy a wisdom tradition is concerned with how should we live? Religions are the vehicle through which wisdom traditions gain traction in history. Theyre steeped in cultural symbols and metaphor. Who needs god?  There are bible scholars who use the same  historical critical method that academic historians use. Some of them Christian but many of them secular academics. Marcus Borg and the Jesus Seminar are the first that come to mind.  But John Dominic Crossan is another, Bart Ehrman, etc. 

You can do this is a way that applies critical analysis.

 BROWN IS UGLY!  
























 I have a similar problem but its not related to anyones attention span.  Most people just care more about being right than they care about having an honest dialog.  Someone who cares about intellectual honesty or participates in the argument to develop a more complete understanding of an issue will always be at a strategic disadvantage when arguing with someone that just wants to win.

 I think this is right. In an honest discussion you have to be ready to be convinced. If you believe you have unique access to the capital "t" Truth  you are really just a salesman and do a disservice to yourself, the other party and the dialog itself.

 "Wherever you find injustice, the proper form of politeness is attack." -- [T-Bone Slim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Bone_Slim) 




 I was told once that Tao te Ching can be understood in 3 distinct ways.  1. how to be a Taoist sage 2. As how to be a good and just ruler 3. How to live a virtuous life.   




 don't forget Chuang Tzu (Zhuangzi / Zhuang Zhou). Probably a close #2 in terms of importance to the tradition.  A little heavier than the Tao te Ching but but the parables can be helpful is fleshing out some of the more abstract concepts that students sometimes have trouble grasping.

 First, let me just say that Im one of those people who tries to listen to an album 3 or 4 times from beginning to end before I decide what I think about it.

If Deltron 3030 is just a colab between Dan the Automator, Kid Koala, and Del then it an adequate to good follow up. In my mind, Deltron 3030 was one of the best concept albums of all time in any genre. Event 2 is missing that epic future apocalypse sound that characterized the first record.

  When you assume there's only one god, you're assuming the truth of at least one religion

Not so. Why couldnt each culture find its own expression of something universal that is beyond all of them? If you want to look at it in a narrow way I suppose you could say that makes all of them wrong, but I think it makes more sense to consider all of them right. I refer you to my own comment above:

 If lots of religions root their traditions in divine origin then one of the things that is common of religions is that they claim diving origin. Religions are cultural-linguistic traditions through which wisdom traditions are able to gain traction in and be transmitted through history. Religions reflect the culture and language from which they are born, and if they are around long enough, which they become.
Lots of cultures means lots of religions. Some religions are monotheistic, some polytheistic, some pantheistic, some henotheistic. It is not uncommon for a religion that is one of these now to have been something else in the past. It is the nature of culture and language to evolve and progress and concepts of god evolve right along with them.
To address your question more directly, many Christians refer to John 14:6 I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. to claim exclusivity. But many theologians simply ask the question. if Jesus is the way, what is the way that Jesus is? meaning that Jesus could be the incarnation of the way just as he is the incarnation of the word but that the way is not an exclusive path but a universal one that is accessible through all of the worlds religious traditions.
A simpler question might just be why would the creator of the entire universe with all its splendor and diversity choose to be known in only one of the worlds religions?  




 let us not forget the trinity

To address your question more directly, many Christians refer to John 14:6  I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. to claim exclusivity. But many theologians simply ask the question. if Jesus is the way, what is the way that Jesus is? meaning that Jesus could be the incarnation of the way just as he is the incarnation of the word but that the way is not an exclusive path but a universal one that is accessible through all of the worlds religious traditions.

A simpler question might just be why would the creator of the entire universe with all its splendor and diversity choose to be known in only one of the worlds religions?

 Joseph Campbell's spin on that, "The fool says in his heart there is no God' (Psalms 14:1). There is, however, another type of fool, more dangerous and sure of himself, who says in his heart and proclaims to all the world, 'There is no God but mine.'" - Joseph Campbell, The Masks of God, Vol. IV: Creative Mythology, p. 28 




 
Honestly, I just feel like Apple Pay pushes the act of spending further into the abstract. Maybe simple impediments to purchasing like finding my wallet are a good thing.   Besides, the idea that Im burdened in some way by having to swipe my cards seems silly. Apple pay is a solution looking for a problem. Lets make fun of it.

 this a great one.  It's the recorded oral tradition and a great read. 









 The blue crew basically executes promotions for the marketing department.  Things may have changed but at the time we were under the same direction of the guy who signed off on the music, graphics, etc.   

Most nights were routine. You come in, talk about the promotions running that night; who was going to escort Charles Glen (or whoever, I believe it was still alternating) to the ice, who was going to round up mighty mites and their parents and get them through security, etc.
We would pick the participants for contests from people on the concourse early so if my friends were going to the game I made sure they knew to be there early and to hang around the section where we came out on to the concourse so they could get one ice for whatever we were doing that night. Officially it was frowned upon but it was understood that if you had friends at the game they could participate in the promotion.

Once I got to wear plain clothes and walk around with a radio and pick the winners for contests on fan appreciation night.  Totally arbitrary; if I dug your shirt, you were the guy.

Probably my favorite story though was one night after the slingshot bowling thing on the ice.  We would get reminded all the time that we HAD to be off the ice before the intermission clock got to a certain time or the Blues would get fined by the NHL.  I think it was 10 minutes but Im not sure.   So we do the sling shot bowling and it goes like it normally does and its time to go.  I unlatch the big bungee cord from the penalty box side of the ice and start to gather it up. At I start to head for the Zamboni pit the guy out there with me starts yelling at me.   I run over and the bench door is closed on the cord and the thing is wedged shut.  We got a guy from the ice crew  over to help us out and the thing just isnt budging.  The clock is ticking down and there is still a huge bungee cord laying all over the ice. So with seconds left I run out and start gathering up the cord and start throwing it onto the bench and dove over the boards as time expired.  We couldnt just hang out on the bench so we ended up cutting the cord and leaving via the locker room which was kind of cool.  

Little things:  

A lot of European players play soccer in the halls to warm up, 

Saw Panger doing a national Hockey night broadcast for ESPN once and he would stand on a box when doing the pregame with Steve Levy.  Just a tiny man.

You all know that Christ Pronger was a beast but Im 61 and generally am thought of as a big guy.  Standing next to Pronger made me feel like less of a man. On skates the guy was just a monster.

I know a guy who managed to turn multiple years on the blue crew into a front office career in the NHL.

The actual Blues offices where the GM and everyone works are right there at Scott trade.  Its the door to the right of the parking garage entrance.  (it just never occurred to me.)
 




 i was on the blue crew for 2 years. back when it was coed.  kind of fun shooting t shirts out of a cannon and watching people eat it in giant hamster balls

 This is a new build (my first) that I finished last week. It's been running great since that time. Yesterday i turned it on and it booted to a blank blue screen with the cursor. I attempted to windows boot disc repair and system restore without any luck. I've checked the ram one stick at a time as was suggested for similar problems here and on toms hardware, no luck there.

This might not be related but at one point last night it booted up normally and while i was was playing a game my wife turned a TV on(i have the HDMI out on the videocard going to a 4x2 HDMImatrix and the second monitor disabled) which seemed to cue the blue screen. Hasn't booted since so i haven't had the opportunity to try and replicate that but it seemed relevant.

I've seen some suggestion for similar issues to attempt to reboot in safe mode and make sure my mobo drivers are up to date. maybe try and older driver for the video care? I'm going to give these 2 a shot first when i get home.

Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

 Deadwood. Jesus, how is that show not at the top of this list. 




 I've tried the other PCI slot without success.  I'm using HDMI but you are correct, nothing from the board or the video card when booting
 




 the power cables look good and I've updated BIOS.  I dont have access to another machine i could try the card in though. 




 I just finished my first build. Without the GPU the system boots fine and runs normally but once the GPU is attached the screen just stays blank. Fans spin and lights come on but nothing else. 1 long beep then 3 short. Some googling pointed me towards the possibility bad video card. any other ideas? Any assistance would be appreciated.

 I was initially put off by the lack of apps so starting looking for a way to run android apps (it's a windows PC why wouldnt there be a way to do that?). I found bluestack and it's worth a shot. It's basically an android emulator. It will allow you to run android apps and that opens up the whole universe of mobile/tablet based applications  




 this is all i was really hoping for. thank you. 




 2nd this.  The common notion that atheism is the neutral position is incorrect. 




 I have not read the book but the basic criticism of the new atheists outlined in the synopsis is dead fucking on. 




 The Varieties of Religious Experience by William James. Arguably one of the most important books of the 20th century. More than 100 years old but great religious scholarship and good read.

I second the recommendation for The World's Religions by Huston Smith. Also, while some scholars turn their noses up at the mono-myth -and its not necessarily religion per se- I still think Joseph Campbell is fantastic, check out The Hero with a Thousand faces.

Sacred texts you cant go wrong with; The Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads,  Tao Te Ching, Chuang Tsu , Dine Bahane (Navajo creation story), The Tibetan book of the Dead, The Lotus Sutra, the Heart Sutra 

Obviously there are more but these are the one I think of most quickly to give you some range within the different traditions. 
 




 worst beer in the world. just awful. 




 yeah, this is the way to go.  i also have an HDMI running to a matrix switch so i can toggle the TV as a monitor whenever. I like my Xbox but it doesn't really add anything this way. 




 I was changing the blade on a hockey stick once and reached out and caught a glob of hot glue as it was falling to the floor... Sticky. Painful. Stupid. 




 I coach youth football and every week the coaches watch our game from the previous week to figure out what we need to work on. 4 dudes pointing at a TV and expecting kids to get what is being explained to them seems like a bridge to far so i'm looking for a way  to highlight what we want them to see.

Most of this is just going to be highlighting individual players on a given play. It doesn't have to be fancy, it could be coloring the player a bright color or drawing a box around them. Then maybe some lines and arrows to indicate gaps and responsibility. the idea is to then email a few examples(maybe as gifs) to the kids parents so they can go over with them during the week. 

My experience with AE is mainly making gifs. This is probably rudimentary stuff but any kind of direction would be appreciated.  




 don't underestimate the value that a full version of windows gives you vs a mobile OS either.  So much flexibility. 

I picked up the i7 as a laptop replacement for my wife to use for school.  But at this point i like it so much i'm probably going to pick up an i3 to replace my iPad. 




 with 128gb micro sd cards in the $100 dollar range now, storage space can be less of a factor. That and all the cloud based storage options available (office 365 gives you 1 TB per user with a membership) is why i went with the 256gb model of the i7 instead of the 500. the bump in storage for the money just didn't seem worth it.  




 I think he's dead on.  Im not a religious person and am generally sympathetic to the kinds of arguments made by atheists. But as someone who has formally studied religion and philosophy, one of the things that has always struck me about Sam Harris specifically and new atheists more broadly is that they just dont know very much about religion. More than that, what they do know demonstrates striking level of conceptual superficiality.  

 




 Most of my life i probably considered myself SBNR. I never associated the idea with new agey spirituality at all, though. To me it was a way to reconcile the sense that there was something more to existence than the visible world while rejecting the institutional structure of religion which I saw as problematic very early on.

These days i just consider myself agnostic. Maybe a panenthiest if you really wanna try and pin it down.

 




 Im convinced that the only way to demonstrate the absurdity of the current false dichotomy of pro-choice vs. pro-life is to argue from the pro-abortion position.  I love this guy.

 Ive been reading both of you guys for a long time, I feel like the policy focus and reasonable tone of the work you guys do is really a breath of fresh air.

 Agreed. The Vader parallel is a good one. I could just never wrap my head around it.  Clearly he's a smart man but it's like he forgot how to think critically. He's a right wing think tank bubble boy.

 http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/03/politics/rand-paul-eric-garner-taxes/index.html

There is something about the most visible spokesperson of a political philosophy, the primary predication of which is suspicion of the state monopoly on violence, standing in front of a camera in the wake of the needless death of an individual at the expense of that power, talking about cigarette taxes that strikes me as ridiculous in the extreme.  Not just ridiculous, sad

Further, I see an absolutely vital place in our national discourse for a libertarian perspective in the wake these killings. We stand to benefit from a voice that is deeply suspicious of not just state power broadly, but with the specific execution of that power. And in a way that is cognizant of the structural inequality within and without our justice system predicated by our political institutions. After all, this is I think the libertarian critique of the state at its best and most useful. What is worse is that I think it is a pernicious and denialist kind of racism that prevents any useful contribution by libertarians. Its like theyve all bought into the idea that we live in a perfect individually driven meritocracy and that systemic variables dont exist oh, except taxes.

Id be interested in what you guys think, I just wanted to get that off of my chest. 
 




 of all the self aggrandizing bullshit... 




 Within the full context of her remarks, shes not wrong really. But it's a nuanced position and most people wont look passed the "concentration camps" line. It's a shame because her view on colonialism's role in the creation of terrorism and extremism spot on.
