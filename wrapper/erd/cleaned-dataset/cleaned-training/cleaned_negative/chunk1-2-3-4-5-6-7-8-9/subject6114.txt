 So basically, I'm writing a proxy server in C. It only needs to handle GET requests atm. I can take a GET request like very simple

GET www.amazon.com HTTP/1.0 

and then generate a request header like follows: 

    GET / HTTP/1.0
    Host: www.amazon.com
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:10.0.3) Gecko/20120305 Firefox/10.0.3
    Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    Connection: close
    Proxy-Connection: close

The proxy then forwards the request to the server in that form and reads the response. I get all the response headers back just fine, but when it comes to reading actual content and forwarding it to the client from the proxy I just get a bunch of replacement characters.

    ^3h)UKfD*yh2' Rb8"u                         =qggEyYj1'sp[MI

I don't really know why this is happening or how to fix it. 

If you need to see how I read from the response file (forward to client) I can post, but I don't think the way it is done has anything to do with why these characters are coming up. 




 The solution was actually really stupid actually. I was thinking along the same thing. I figured maybe the charging port had shifted or loosened and couldn't get enough current to charge. Turns out when it fell the charger was actually destroyed like at the end and my spare wasn't working either. Just needed a new charger. Damn I felt stupid. 




 As said in title - I just dropped my phone and it was almost dead so I tried to charge it and it no longer charges. Turned off/on, reset etc. I have no idea what to do? 




 I just searched around for them and only found one that looked like it - sadly without color :( If anyone knows I would love the one like the one on the car 
























 The content is gzipped but I have no idea how to take this into account -

 The cost of removing an element in a linked list is definitely less than rewriting an entire array. Worst case linked list search is O(n) time, but uses no resources, and fixing pointers is O(1) time with what, 2 writes? 

Meanwhile, copying and writing to a new array is what, 2n - 1 read/write operations? This is way more expensive in terms of resources. 




 So, I'm not sure what is going on here but consider this.

    output_greaterequal-first-next = pointer;
    temp =output_greaterequal-first-next;
    temp-next=NULL;

So imagine this is not the first element being put in your list. It is over the threshold, and there is already something in the list. You set the next element of the list to be the pointer so you could have had this to begin with:

First-A-B-C-NULL 

or something like that.
This means first-next is A. But now, you set first-next to pointer (P). So, now your list looks like this.

First-P

and then temp is also set to P, and then it looks like this.

Temp = P-NULL

and now the value is NULL so we break out but your list was messed up in the process it seems?  




 I'm not totally sure what you are trying to do but if you are trying to compare digits of numbers you can use % to get specific digits right, since modular arithmetic would get rid of the rest of the number? 

ex. 13 % 10 = 3

To get the 10's digit would be a bit different,

134 for example would be (134 % 100) / 10
134 % 100 is 34, and 34 / 10 is 3.  
























 You should look into Systems Level programming. Personally I find it incredibly interesting and fun. 

http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/

This is a pretty legit textbook to get you started, it also has like 7 labs in it to help you learn assembly, things like buffer overflow attacks, how to write your own malloc implementation and more. It is in C, not java - but still a great fucking book.  




 As I was going to St. Ives,  
I met a man with seven wives,  
Each wife had seven sacks,  
Each sack had seven cats,  
Each cat had seven kits:  
Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,  
How many were there going to St. Ives?   




 The proxy forwards all the headers shown above to the client.  




 I don't think that is actually true... If he just works with them all on the stack. Isn't that true? Then he can just access them all as element.value rather than element-value 
























 Could you perhaps try

     String.format("%02d:%02d:%02d", hour, minutes, seconds); 




 I would consider using python! Python is a scripting language and is pretty easy to pick up and learn and you can do a lot with it - that's why it is used as an intro language for lots of CS courses. 

There are also a lot of modules you can use to help you create nice things such as PyGame etc. I would definitely consider giving it a look.

 my first thought

 yeah, i send emails to an address like that all the time but when i try to send it form IFTTT it seems to just chop off the beginning.  




 The email I am trying to send is to a dlist and the format of the email is something like +dlist+~orgname/dlist/group@school.edu however, when ifttt sends it to gmail it gets sent as group@school instead of the entire dlist. 




 Perhaps you could do a cascading sort of notification system where if it is raining in a certain area it triggers an event, and that event will always trigger an iOS notification that has the zip code it will be raining in. Not sure if it will work but just a thought. 




 As title says, the trigger is the start of a calendar event but the recipe has never been run and many events should have triggered it. It is on a shared calendar could this be the reason it is not working?  
























 Using the thing to scroll on the computer while cooking is kind of useless since she stops fixing the salad to do it. Might as well just use the trackpad on the computer at that point... 




 I only brush my teeth once a day :( 




 There seems to be a lot of Hispanic people saying it isn't part of the culture to think someone dying is funny, and it isn't. It also isn't sad though, at least not in Mexican culture. Death is a happy thing, and celebrated on holidays like `Day of the Dead` so maybe it isn't taken to hard in their family. People saying they are assholes seem to be pretty quick to judge, and are telling you what you want to hear. 




 It currently is very difficult to make a recipe that is complex and robust. Sometimes, it is even harder to link recipes with events that you want to happen because it is a three step process where the middle step is disjoint from the final step. 

I wanted to have a recipe that every day at 12:30 PM grabbed the top post from a subreddit and posted it to the GroupMe. Now, I may be wrong - but I did look around and can't really think of a way to do this. However, if there was a way to make IFTTT recipes a trigger, it would really open up the possibilities for this. It would allow for hugely extensible recipes that could do huge amounts of work for you or even just provide some really cool functionality. Just a thought.

If someone knows how to do what I'm asking I would love to know since right now I'm pretty lost. 
























 Lucy, the movie had so much potential but they pretty much completely squandered the entire thing. It was such a cool idea :(

 I am very interested in seeing if this is possible anymore or at all. I have stumbled across a few posts from years ago where people have done this and seem to have the links removed. If anyone has any information about how to do something like this thanks in advance!
