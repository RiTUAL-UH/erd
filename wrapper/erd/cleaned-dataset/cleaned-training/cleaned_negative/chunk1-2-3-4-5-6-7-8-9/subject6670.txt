 You could always get some UV Protecting arm sleeves off of Amazon. I started using them recently and no longer have this problem! 




 There was minimal brake fade, I applied the brakes for a few seconds at a time to give them time to cool off in between. I do have the basalt braking surface on my rims, I'm not sure if that plays a role in not overheating 




 The largest descent I've done was about 500 feet over 3 miles... got up to 43-44 mph at the bottom 




 I got mine from farsports. 38mm front and 50mm rear, 650 shipped and they came in at 1290 grams. I've put about 1300 miles on them and haven't had a single issue. Even braking is pretty good (assuming you have a decent set of brakes... I have ultegra 6700 on my bike)

 I'm going to give this a shot tonight 




 It was my first time cooking duck, wasn't aware I was supposed to score the skin. Does scoring provide any benefits other than aesthetics?  




 We first baked two potatoes, then cut one in half and scraped out all but 1/4" of it. We completely scraped out the other potato. The potatoes were then blended with cream cheese, butter, brown sugar, salt, pepper, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cayenne. This mixture was then pipetted back into the first potato skin that we cut in half and then baked for 15 mins. Turned out great! 




 100% recommend 




 Mmm sounds delicious  




 What else could I use it for?

 It was actually my first time making duck! But for steak the sous vide provides an even medium rare with no overcooked exterior. The meat comes out super tender all the way through when on the skillet it sometimes comes out a little tough  




 It turned out great! So juicy and tender throughout. Thanks!

 I really want this to be the case :( 














 My girlfriend had a plate too. This is just half the steak (it was a 17oz cut) 




 I highly recommend trying it. It has changed meat for me completely. There are tons of diy ways but I just bought a sous vide machine made by anova culinary: http://anovaculinary.com/  




 Wow you're right it does look way better! 




 here's another dish I posted a while back... I think you may like the plating a little more

http://i.imgur.com/9XOx56o.jpg  




 haha i could have plated it better... it was late and I was starving and just wanted to eat! 




 Here you go:

Seasoned the steak with salt and pepper. Sous Vide with 1 tablespoon butter at 131F for 90 mins, then seared it for 1 minute per side on a really hot grill

Boiled red potatoes, mashed with 10 cloves roasted garlic, salt, pepper, butter, and milk until you reach your desired consistency. I even added the leftover juice from the sous vide bag :)

Zucchini and asparagus were seasoned with salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne, garlic powder, and olive oil. Throw them on a hot grill for about 5-10 minutes, flipping occasionally.

Broccoli rabe was blanched for 1 minute, then sauteed with roasted garlic, salt, pepper, and olive oil. It was my first time trying it, I didn't really like it (tasted kinda like horseradish) 




 Ribeye has always been my favorite. I actually enjoy the fattiness haha 









 Yeah I couldn't justify the extra $100 for an illuminated reticle. I'll probably never be shooting in low light situations  




 Glass is crystal clear, eye relief is about 4 inches I think. Awesome scope tho, highly recommended. It's just enormous, almost 16" with the sunshade on 




 The varmint models come with the 26" heavy barrel. I looked at the Magpul stock too, seems way economical specially since you can add the detachable magazine for not much more money. I just didn't want to wait :) 




 That's always great news, haha.

For now I'm just shooting Federal Gold Medal Match 168gr factory ammo. Once I become more comfortable I may start handloading, but I doubt it'd give me any advantage just yet since I'm still learning. 




 Remington 700 SPS Varmint chambered in 308.

I upgraded the stock to a Bell and Carlson Medalist Tactical/Varmint Style 2. Didn't really like the X-mark pro trigger so I swapped it out with a Timney 512. 

Optic is a Vortex Viper HS-T 6-24x50 SFP with milrad reticle. The mount is a Nightforce one-piece direct mount, 20 MOA.

Lastly is the Harris bipod, 9-13 inch. 

This is my first bolt-action and I'm looking forward to getting to know it and shooting a bunch to work on my accuracy. It will mainly only be used as a target gun.

Good job, reddit... 
























 Oh. I was being sarcastic anyways 




 Now you have 7 upvotes :) 




 Yeah, the sous vide is much quicker. I've used the reverse sear oven method many times with bigger cuts like prime rib, excellent results 




 Eh, I like my meat rare. This is cooked to 125F (rare is 120-130F for lamb). Also haven't died from E. Coli poisoning yet so there's that 




 No it obviously came from my garlic mustard tree out back 




 It was at 125F for an hour, followed by 6-7 mins under the broiler on low 




 Who said I was white? 




 Why thank you! 




 see below

 Yeah I have to hold my breath when I cut open to cryo-vac packaging haha 




 Yeah I have a tall steel pot I usually use. Pre-heat the water and throw the vacuum sealed meat in.

This rack was exactly 1.5lbs, and I left it in about 1 hour 




 Anova sous vide. Love it :) I applied the garlic mustard paste and broiled it after sous viding it 




 lol 




 Horseradish if you like horseradish. Otherwise, maybe just try it with the garlic and oil 




 i don't get it. 




 Not too difficult. There are a lot of diy guides online 




 I posted the recipe below 




 Check out the Anova sous vide 




 First I rinsed the lamb and then pat it dry. I used salt, pepper, onion powder, sumac, and sliced raw garlic on both sides of the lamb, then vacuum sealed it with 1 tbs butter. Used my Anova sous vide to cook it at 125F for at least 1 hour (you can leave it in the water bath up to 3 hours). 

Once you put the lamb in, you can start on the crust. Wrap about 8-10 cloves of garlic with some olive oil in aluminum foil and throw in a 400F oven for 45 mins to an hour. It's going to make your house smell heavenly so be prepared. 

Once the garlic is done, place it in a bowl. Add 2-3 tbs of mustard (I used spicy brown) and about 1 tbs olive oil. Add any other seasonings you want... I used salt, pepper, and sumac to complement the flavors in the lamb. Mash everything together to make a thick paste.

Remove the lamb from the vacuum bag and pat it dry. Place in a roasting pan or on a baking sheet and generously smear the garlic paste all over the top. Then set your oven broiler to low, and put the lamb on the top rack for about 6 minutes (I had to move it a few times under my broiler to get an even sear).

Remove from broiler once the crust looks good to you, let it sit for 5 mins and then carve away.

Hope you enjoy!
 




 Here it is before carving:

http://i.imgur.com/1mgMTa1l.jpg  




 No, it was insanely tender. Fell apart in my mouth 




 I sous vide it at 125F to account for the additional temp increase when putting it under the broiler to make the crust. Rare lamb is from 120-130F 




 Just made a thick paste out of roasted garlic, spicy brown mustard, olive oil, salt, pepper, and sumac. Apply the paste after its done in the sous vide and throw it under your oven broiler on low for about 6-7 minutes 




 I pat dried it after sous vide-ing... then put on my paste and threw it under the oven broiler on low for about 6-7 minutes 









 browned shallot and garlic in butter, added wine and cream and it became this color! maybe the longostino and shrimp added the pink hue?
