 Got to love what they have accomplished with this Channel, I love the new Astronomy and Government courses.  




 Rocky 
























 the struggle is real 





























 Must watch videos of chainsaws and trucks to feel like a man again

 That day was my father's birthday, being from Costa Rica, he didn't care at all of the NFL playoffs. So, he wanted to go to the movies, we saw The Hobbit. 
Watched the first half of the game before the movie and thought "ok, I think it's better if I stop watching". Couldn't believe the score when I came out of the room  




 Love it. Next you have to do an eye tracker graph  
























 I'm really looking forward for it.
