 wow thanks so much! Yup that sounds about right.  




 I know : / For my own modest personal use I can get away with a 5g for most small to medium beers. (Or so I've read) My friend who brews with me has a 15 G rectangular cooler that we can use if needed.  




 Yes but I will have an 8 gallon kettle soon. Never thought I'd be this pumped to get any kitchen equipment  




 Awesome! You would use 6.5 gallon carboy or bucket for that?

Also- if my mash tun only holds 5 gallons, can I sparge again to reach a proper boil volume? Or fly sparge ? Thanks! 




 These look great. Noob question:

Batch size is the amount of beer at the end of fermentation?

 




 Yea of course! Since I have limited volume for boiling, mash, fermenting etc anything that will yield roughly 4ish gallons once transferred f primary would be great. 5 gallon everything. For my birthday I am asking the brew fairy for a 7+ gallon kettle.  :D

 




 Hey all. New AG brewer and I would love some ideas for recipes you have tried with success. I am into any style of beer but my favorites are dry-Irish Stout's and virtually any English Blonde or Brown Ale. Would love to keep it noob friendly for all those who only have limited resources and experience like myself. I have a 5 gallon mashtun and a 5 gallon brew pot along with everything that came with Brewers Best base starter kit + a second 5 Gallon Fermenter. The more detail in your instructions would really help myself (as well as others looking to start or have just started AGB) out. Thanks a lot and look forward to reading! 




 Oh I definitely will get myself and iodine test. I didnt know I could get it at a CVS. 

As I get more familiar with all grain, I will try out some irish moss. I have heard good things. 

As for the carboy, I usually cover it with a towel to prevent light exposure. I removed it for the pics. Should I be wetting this towel? Does it really have a large impact on temperature?

Wondering how I can be sure I used enough water per pound of grain in y mash so for next time I want to be sure. I used http://www.brewersfriend.com/mash/
If I wish to build a recipe giving me 3 gallons at the end, what is the best way of going about that? Love the help so thanks a lot for that! 




 Thanks a lot! You know it 




 Thanks! I will invest in my own hydrometer. I left it at my buddies place from our last brew. Rookie move. I will also see how an iodine test can help if they are not expensive. Will need to research refractors and buy a hose for my barb on my mash tun.

Looks like its fermenting nicely. Some observations:

The color in ambient light is a nice dark Guinness like brown/light black. Shined a light to get a good look at the inside (to see what the hop situation is like) hops seem to floating around and appear to chillin on the krausen. What perplexed me was the color under this little light. It was more of a unattractive brown (see pics for an idea)  Cause for concern? I referred to my other beer for reference. 

My Irish red looks and smells amazing especially in ambient light. I then shined a light on it briefly and it too had a weird brownish hue. I am thinking the light doesn't help any appearances. 

I am gathering I extracted enough sugars from the malt and pitched enough yeast as it's a pretty active fermentation. Let me know if anyone has some advice as to how to clear up the beer, colors in early stages of fermentation etc. Would love to hear back. Thanks !

First Runnings http://imgur.com/sbqwzvg,aalmpgT#1 




 I have a few extract batches under my belt and I was really excited about trying an all grain recipe! I made my mash tun and I was ready to go. (I thought) So I went to my local homebrew shop and asked for enough ingredients for a 3 gallon batch. He hooked me up with assorted grains and hops for a porter. 2 row pale, chocolate, crystal, black and hops. I preheated my mash tun and then I started the process. 

I mashed for an hour at 151 degrees and vorlaufted until the wort was clear. It looked really good actually! Fly sparged but not sure if I did it well enough. Over time I expect I will understand more of how that works...
The boil really looked great. Barely anything floating in there, the foam looked like a barista at a coffee shop took his time making a cappuccino but instead of coffee it was my wort. I was pumped.

So the boil when on for an hour and the guy who gave me the ingredients said to just hop at flame out. I was like hmmm maybe I will add some at 30 minutes. So I did. I also added some at the very end of my boil. Thats when I was like hmmm. I see too many hops hopping around in this thing. Not sure if thats ok. I said dont focus on it...


After cooling the wort to 70 degrees there seemed to be a lot of gook at the bottom of my boil pot. It gave the wort an interesting hoppy aroma, naturally. Not that it was bad, just something I was not expecting. Then I siphoned into the carboy. I aerated the wort in the 3 gal carboy for 2 minutes and pitched my yeast. Sealed it and now I am wondering wtf I did will be ok or if it will kill me. 
Long story (sorry) short, I have no idea what to expect and I was wondering if anyone out there has just said 'hey Im going to see what happens today" and what the results were. Not sure how efficient the brew was as it was my first all grain but its all a learning process. (I am a novice homebrewer and I would appreciate any feedback. I really do enjoy the craft ----) Thanks for reading! :) 




 huge help! Thank you 




 Wow this site is incredible. Thank you! I ordered a kit that comes with a 3 piece ball valve, coupling, SS mesh filter etc. Cooler on Amazon. Looks like I have everything I need coming my way minus ingredients! 




 Ah thanks! I worry about the rules. Slowly noticing people take the trial and error approach with building these (and other things) I guess. As long as you have a seal, something to filter out grains on the inside, food safe parts and a way to transfer into a kettle, one would assume everything will work out, no? 




 I also feel like this has many of the components to help jump start the project. Ball Valve coupling gasket etc

 Thanks, Chino_Brews! I understand now. I will look into this more as I get familiar with homebrewing.  




 Ah. Thank you for that clarification. Thats what I thought. Very informative. This is a new hobby for me and I am excited to take it further. Even more pumped to drink this brew :D 




 Thanks! When you say 'not that great', how do you mean? I am not too worried but just was wondering what the community thinks. I didnt hydrate the yeast before pitching. What are the benefits of that? 




 I brewed a 1 gal batch of Irish Red the other day. Wondering if adding too much yeast affects clarity of the beer. They said to add roughly half but I may have added 55-60% of the packet at most to the fermenter. The fermentation was "happy" to say the last. Very active and I needed a blow off. When I exchanged the blow off for the air lock the aroma was very pleasant! Looking forward to drinking this one in a few weeks. Any thoughts  ??

 Hey all. New to owning any vintage gear so go easy on me :D I just got this receiver and after getting to know it a bit better, I have grown to really love it. There are some kinks however:
-Upon opening the box after getting it from my FedEx man and plugging it in, the left channel produced a very fuzzy, uncentered sound. After playing around, it seemed to go away. This was all in while my turntable was plugged into phono. Aux seems to work ok in that regard. Phono later seemed to work fine. Used for a few days and no issues. After work today I played a record and the left channel seemed to do the same thing but after switching to aux and back to phono, that fuzzy gross sound was gone. I feel like it needs a few to warm up. Anyone else have similar experience?
-While plugged into aux and with phones plugged in, the volume in the left channel decreases suddenly w.o warning. 
-Overall, the left channel is more muffled than a crystal clear right. I tested the speakers and it is not them. In the mix, it all sounds balanced and really warm. I have checked both the main and remote channels and they produce the same sound. 
-In the end, I love the quality of sound this thing produces. Overall, my Technics can play many records and sound great especially if I am spinning vintage records (Rush, Steely Dan, Police, Steve Miller Etc) and even sounds great with the newer stuff (Glass Animals, Sharon Jones, Flylo etc) It seems to me that hiccups only happen within the first 10 minutes off a cold start. I am wondering if these little quirks are all part of owning awesome equipment like this and if anyone has similar problems and how they deal/dealt with them. Thanks all! 




 listening to my dads "Aja" right now 




 Just found out my dad has an Technics SA 303 from when he was in school in the 80s. Were gunna grab it out of storage this weekend. Super pumped. Still curious as to why Home Theater receivers made 20 years later just dont cut it for audio. Appreciate the info! 




 Hey all. Looking to upgrade receivers as I have been using an Onkyo home theater receiver for a while now. Any recommendations for casual listener like myself? Anyone familiar with Technic's receivers at all? Would really appreciate some ideas.  




 It was about 69 degrees. It was in the fermenter for aprx 4.5 weeks. It tasted pretty good but it did have a soy sauce aroma.  




 Hey all. Just bottled our dry Irish stout yesterday and I noticed that it had a soy sauce smell. Gave it a taste and for an uncarbed, room temp beer, it had the right flavor and an aftertaste reminiscent that of a guinness. I am sure its all part of the beers progression to my glass but wondering if anyone else has had a similar smell upon bottling their dry stout. Cheers! 









 If you're asking me about price, you're barking up the wrong tree. :D 









 My gallon batches go crazy by the next morning! Makes me very happy  




 Thanks for the info. Looks like this yeast was packaged in April -____- Thought that it would be enough. We pitched a second package of dry yeast in there. I would rather over pitch than under pitch. If I do a full boil, does that mean I would require more yeast for fermentation? 




 no I didnt make a starter. Kinda new at this. But I know there is no action because the airlock is dormant and my carboy is krausen free. Looks the same as it did when I put the wort in the fermenter two days ago. Maybe its slow to start? Temp in the room is about 68. Kinda wondering whats up at this point.  




 So I am wondering why this Dry Irish Stout is not fermenting. I usually use dry yeast but I tried out Wyeast's Irish Ale liquid variant. Every other batch I have done, extract or all-grain has started to ferment within 6 hours. Its been 2 days and literally nothing. I decided to pitch some dry ale yeast I had around. Its pretty fresh so hopefully something will happen  soon. Any ideas or thoughts from previous experience reddit?? 




 Nice lookin mugs/brew! congrats 




 Just one quick Q. How much of my hops should I add to my kettle pre boil? and if it only a percentage, when should I add the rest? Thank you for the help!! 




 Thanks! Just to clarify are you saying that it should be at leasts 2 weeks ish in the Primary?

Also, what would you suggest the proper mash thickness should be? 1.25 qt/1lb grain? 




 Trying this recipe this weekend! Any tips?  




 Thanks for the reply. I know that the ring is normal but what about those white particles above the krausen? 




 I attempted an all grain brew for the first time. Didn't really smell too nice after the boil. Before it was awesome. Kinda smells odd now. Then I see these white things on the side or my fermenter after 3 days. Any ideas? Is this an infection or should I not worry? I'm tempted to dump it an try again for real in a week or so. Its only like 2 gallons.

 next brew day! 




 Wow I really appreciate this! Thanks a lot. I will definitely try this soon and get back to you. As soon as I get this 8 Gal kettle I can definitely do a 5 gal full boil and not be as paranoid. 

I do have one question. When you say add hops to the secondary, is this immediately after I transfer it from the primary after initial fermentation?  
























 Thanks for the cents! We are looking for an AG recipe. Looking to pick up from our local HB store. Any tips for using actual berries either in the secondary or flame out or in any capacity at all? Wondering how to best achieve those flavors. cheers.

 Depends on the mood. If im super stoned I will listen to very laid back chillwave esc electronic. I am not unknown to listen to 80s RnB with friends and have the occasional dance party. Love me some 60s   70s classic rock. Huge Rush and Moody Blues fan. Classical music is also super cool. Steve Reich to Bruckner-its all awesome. 




 Me and some friends were lucky enough to be there for this when they filmed it. They played through the tune like 6 times and each time it got better. As a trumpet player, I was super impressed that their trumpeter had the chops to play like that 6+ times. They ended up playin us some other fun stuff at the end. These dudes are crazy good and super fun! Real deal 




 Wow never done that. I'm sure it tasted lovely!

 smoking with friends outside makes me forget about the cold. We talk and its easy to not worry about weather and just focus on conversation. Otherwise, when I am alone, just dress warm, light my j and enjoy being with my thoughts. I did go to school where it averaged 0 degrees during the winter months so I have some training. Good luck! 




 great soundtrack. This reminds me a lot of some Phillip Glass operas. Check out Satyagraha if you like the Interstellar score. 

Unrelated to Glass, Steve Reichs Music for 18 Musicians is phenomenal. You will certainly go places if you listen to that above a [4]

 yea dude. I saw! So excited for them. Gunna totally check em out live next week at Rockwood in NYC 









 Hence the question. I had no idea. I now know all of this and so much more. It's great.  




 Full disclosure. I am a musician. Studied music theory, all eras of western music history and performance practice in college while playing in up to 10 ensembles a semester. I know how to analyze 12 tone music, perform some of my instruments hardest repertoire as well as understand its significance but I do not understand basic construction principles. I did not take a single class on the subject. I also have not played minecraft. Im more of a fall out 3 guy. Shadows of Mordor is also dope. Mario and Zelda are my bread and butter.  




 I will for sure  




 I was hoping to find out more about this. It was part of my original question so I appreciate you chiming in. Anyone have any insight? 




 Wow. I wood've had no idea 




 I live in the US, yup. Love hearing what the rest of the world uses to construct homes and why. Maybe we should take pages from their books.  




 Is this legit? 




 Do you see this changing in the future? How will we use wood to build our homes? Do you think we will see a shift to using more manmade materials over wood? Have you started to see this at all? Sorry for the questions. Very interested to learn what your thoughts are. 

Edit: I am speaking from a North American perspective. I am learning now that it seems we love our timber more than most of the world. Fascinating to hear about the alternatives and how sustainable wood is! 
 




 At this pace well probably see that as reality sooner than we'd hope. 

Edit: thanks for the knowledge folks! Had no idea wood was this sustainable.  




 In a world with no trees or a severe lack of trees, where would we turn? Besides that sounding like this intro to a shitty movie trailer, what can will humans use to make reliable and safe structures?  




 I was commuting to work and I saw a newly completed wood frame of an apartment complex made from - well you guessed it - wood! Nothing crazy. We build shit with wood all the time. Seems just like standard fare at this point. 

But wood is prone to so much damage especially over time; accidents, rotting, etc etc not to mention other environmental reasons. Why (besides our lack of desire for change and the sheer convenience factor) something else more durable and for lack of a better term, 'furureproof' has not been used or developed yet? If it has been, why has it not been made scalable.

EDIT: Thanks for your responses everyone. I am learning so much about wood, its uses in modern home construction, its sustainability and all of the alternative materials the rest of the world uses to build its homes. This is great! 

EDIT 2: So far today I learned that you can make not only houses from hemp but cars as well. Add that to the list of things everyone has contributed with, I can say that wood is very cool. Seems that while wood may work great in some places, in others it does not make as much sense. Love the endless stream of information that has been put forth in the thread, so for that I thank you all for answering my question and exceeding my wildest expectations. Looking forward to seeing us innovate with both timber and other materials as we build our homes in safer and stronger ways than ever before. 

EDIT 3: "Wood actually grows on trees" Cheers for that, folks!

 DAMN SON! Got me lol. Yea you're right still awesome AF tho right?? 'Pride' by Dynamo is killer. Their vocalist has a beautiful voice.  




 Bill Laurance was an original member Snarky Puppy, not to mention many of the personnel on his new record are from the current incarnation of the group. This includes Snarky Puppy's leader Michael League on bass and "Sput", one of their amazing drummers. Makes sense to me that Bill Laurance would record his album in similar Snarky Puppy fashion. The 'live' recording setup seems to work well for Ropeadope artists. 

As far as the musical influence, I hear something that strays a bit further left field from Snarky Puppy's concept of sound but I can totally understand what you're saying. In my opinion 'Swift', Laurance's new record, strays further away from the gospel of fusion that Snarky Puppy has given us and has taken an almost Phillip Glass contemporary classical oriented approach. The textures and themes throughout the songs almost are reminiscent of minimalist music of the 20th century. Sprinkle some Snarky Puppy juice on there and you have one hell of a musical cocktail.  




 If our beer sucks, oh well. We love it and so do our friends so we thought we would give it a whirl! 




 I agree. So pumped for their album. If you like Snarky Puppy and Bill Laurance you'd love Dynamo. Check out (Pride)[ Dynamo - Pride (Find Your Way)[https://youtu.be/wUxXaHdzxQU] 









 That is a very quick jump to the extreme

 This is Bill Laurance's group but a lot of the players on his new album are from Snarky Puppy.  
























 I know! Check [this](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-02/26/spotify-axes-apps) article. Looks like the apps took away from actually listening and discovering music aside from a few key players. Musixmatch was so popular they just integrated it.  




 Soundrop has been removed from Spotify as have most 3rd party apps. We used to use Soundrop at work but have not been able to since they decided to do away with 3rd party apps. Will have to look into plug.dj! 




 Yea ive been using their activity feed for a while and it's great. I'm hoping they make this live. For example: a listen with button or something of the like. Then you really are listening along with friends or artists. Totally at their discretion

1. How did you come up with the idea for the Dyson Air-Blade?

2. Who did you tell first about the idea to affirm your desires for a superior hand dryer and how did they react to learning that you wanted to make something that blows air out instead of being sucked in?

3. Do you think your invention has revolutionized modern bathrooms across the globe and if so, how?

4. Have you ever left a restroom using your own invention saying to yourself "Wow! My hands are so dry and that was fucking fun" just like we all do when we use your product?

5. What is your favorite type of chicken wing sauce?

For Under 500 USD you can get your music room similarly set up. It really is very solid IMO! If I had my way I would have gotten better speakers but as long as you have music and a comfy chair (my great grandfathers leopard colored-zebra patterned is what I use) you are golden! 
 














 perhaps but I feel that some genres still command a core following; a certain type of 'stereotypical' listener. Or it might just mean that music is more accessible and due to this people are listening to all different genres rather because they are all so easy to find. The internet is a global musical-ecosystem where all of these genres are floating around and is easy to access by all types of people. In contrast before the internet, it was much harder to find different types of music outside of what your community's radios were playing. That was why your spectrum of choice was mostly influenced by the radio and perpetuated to the other people around them and down the line to kids etc etc.  




 Love Streetlight Manifesto. Huge into jazz also. I work for a company who work with tons of metal artists and when I hear about all the subgenres I cant begin to wrap my head around it.

 Great point. Last night's really put that into perspective. 

TV spoilers below. 

So many things seem so trivial now but conversely, a lot of the feuds between houses could impact so much in the grand scheme of things. Bolton v Baratheon will determine if we see an entire army aid in the fight against the wights. Dany will most likely learn of what is really going on beyond the wall and focus her attention there. Tyrion will have to be our champion here. Her dragons now hold a huge key to forging weapons to fight the most dangerous threat known to their world. So she better learn to tame those things. And Bran is acting as Frodo did in LOTR. A huge burden to bear, essentially alone. We all probably suspect he and his contingent will be a huge asset to the fight against the Night King and his army. Not to mention so many others. My brain hurts. So many possibilities and all we can do is sit at the mercy of D D/GRRM. 

Edit: grammar 









 Hold on guys I gotta charge my pants.

 Its like having a kid. Not everyone plans on it but if it does happen, its pretty nice - until they shit on you.  




 "where have you been all of this time?!?!" 




 Nice shots! How far back were you? 




 I was 15 at my first Rush show. It was a good year. 




 We watched Dany go through something similar. We were not as attached to her as a character yet. Watching last nights post Wedding scene for me was almost as shocking as the Red Wedding. I'm rooting for Theon to make moves. Although chances are slim.  




 I just think so much of Power Windows and Caress of Steel are underrated. I love 'The Necromancer' and 'Fountain of Lamneth' so much not to mention those tracks helped birth '2112'. Geddy's bass parts on Power Windows are amazing. Namely 'The Big Money', 'Grand Designs' and 'Marathon'. 




 Happy birthday! What kind of kettle is that? Looks sweet.

 Everything Everything can best be described as Prog Pop but critics will label them as Art Rock. The band says they skew more pop.

The Lyrics are provocative and the music straddles the border of the most progressive to the catchiest of pop hooks. A must listen! 









 Thanks for the praise! You'll hate the name of our stout then. "Mint Chocolate Girl Stout". American Stout with fresh mint and chocolate. 




 Brew partner provided a thorough guide! 




 Naranja is Spanish for the color orange. Hops for the IPA cept we spelled it with a 'j' because it has an 'h' sound in Spanish! 









 Victory screech!!! 




 Why not? 




 great. I have never felt passionate about a candidate before and for the first time, I am extremely excited about backing somebody who could bring about the progress we need with a track record to prove it. Working to spread the word as well as support as much as I can for my state.  




 I am very new to this. Never declared a party. I am 100% behind Bernie and just sent in my affiliation for NJ. Are candidates really not voted on until next June?  




 Donated and got a sticker. I've never given a single thought to backing a politician in my life but here is to firsts. Bernie has my vote. 




 is there an active link to purchase this shirt? 




 Hey Andr. Love your remixes and originals a bunch! What is your process for making another artists song your own? How do you conceptualize a remix from start to finish? Cheers. 









 Do you feel that art has helped you understand the known or unknown universe at all? If so, how? 




 An audible gasp was what escaped my mouth when I heard the news. A legend. He will be missed big time but man, what a life he led. Rest easy, Sir.  




 He finally got the screentime to show us all that he is a jolly dude. Love that guy. 




 was studying abroad and my trip to Amsterdam was about a week away. I asked my friends to help me out. They obliged. I didn't inhale properly and it didn't work but once I figured it out that European Dominos tasted pretty good.  




 I work in music distribution on the retail side of things. I've been lucky enough to work both at major labels and indie labels. People are buying records more than you think so thank you to everyone who supports artists and by association, the people like us who work for them. It is part of my job to get familiar with every DMS (digital music service) as to better cater our content to their consumers. 

I am a Spotify power user. I love Spotify. It is my choice for on demand streaming. There are tons of great alternatives that essentially provide the same benefits like Deezer, now soft launching in the US, Rdio, Google Play All Access, Tidal, Guvera and many more. 

While I use Spotify for the endless amounts of curated mixes for any mood, genre, decade, (not to mention pick   curate my own playlists) I use Google Play Access to store all of my owned and downloaded content in the cloud. This way I can listen to anything I own that may not be available for streaming. Google also has an a la carte download model akin to iTunes. 

A new service called MixRadio (formally Nokia Music) is what I use for personalized algorithmic based playlists. Users get 6 skips and it is ad supported but the amount of music I have learned from using this service has amazed me ever since its launch. It learns your likes and dislikes better than most all other services IMO. Definitely give it a try.

Other stores like eMusic are totally different. They have a tiered subscription model for members. Each tier allows customers to buy a certain dollar amount of music a month. $11.99 a month gives you roughly 25 song downloads at $.69 - $.99 a track or 3-4 full albums. The plans range from amount to amount but prices are very competitive to combat iTunes leading download store market share. 

End of the day, it is what works for you. As long as you consume music in a way that is convenient all while supporting the artists and business people behind the scenes, its all good. Happy listening! 

edit: spelling 




 Yup - that is weed.  




 They probably wrote him out of the show at this point tbh. I would like them to return, however. There are so many storylines that need love i.e. Brotherhood Without Banners.  




 A king or high lord could make it happen 




 By Bran's burden I mean his journey.  He is beyond the wall with the Reeds to learn what the three eyed raven is about, the significance of his visions and who 'the children' and how they can help. Not to mention honing his warg ability. Probably a host of other things but those are probably some of the most important bits.  




 You smart smart human, you
