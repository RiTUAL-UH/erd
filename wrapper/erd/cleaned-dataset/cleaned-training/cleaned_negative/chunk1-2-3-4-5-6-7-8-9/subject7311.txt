 How do you deal with different reactions (positive/negative) to your cosplays and other professional photo shoots that you do? (meaning underwear ect). I'm guessing most people/fans will be happy with your work but is it difficult at times when there are people simply "hating" or "trolling" on your page in an effort to put down the great work you do?

 Hey, so lately I've been watching a lot of **Miyazaki** films, such as **Spirited Away**, **Princess Mononoke** and **My Neighbour Totoro**. I've also watched **The Raid** and **Raid 2**, and I think they're pretty awesome. I was wanting to get more in to Asian cinema as a whole. 

I like a wide variety of movies, and have no idea where to start. Are there any **large blockbuster** asian movies I should check out? And any **small/independent** films worth watching too? 

If you could give **reasons** to watch these films too without spoilers then I would appreciate it greatly.

**Preferably** no horror suggestions, as I am a massive wimp, however I do hear that some great horror films have originally come out of Asia.  




 I personally hope he does, he was one of the only redeemable qualities of the prequels, and it would be interesting to see what obi-wan did between 3   4. Unless it's just adventures on Tatooine. 
























 Thanks, forgot about checking the Criterion! 




 Thanks, I used to watch death note when I was younger (15/16), and I don't mind gore, so I'll be sure to look up Living Hell and Battle Royale. 

I've never watched foreign comedies, does the humour translate well over subs? Or would it be best to search for a dubbed version? 
























 Thanks :) 




 I don't mind older films at all, so thank you!

I've seen Seven Samurai get mentioned a lot, so I think I'll definitely check that out first. 
























 Thanks for the list, saving them all to look up later :) 




 Thanks, just looked up Dragon Tiger Gate, looks interesting :D
