 Vine: Me eating a do- 




 That is for soreness after you run. Fermentation is not an immediate process, it takes time. Lactic acid is a side product of fermentation. If you really want to rid yourself of being sore, stretch. It won't get rid of the pain but it will spread the lactic acid out throughout your body and you will feel it less.  




 GLaDOS: "There was even going to be a party for you. A big party that all your friends were invited to. I invited your best friend, the Companion Cube. Of course, he couldn't come because you murdered him. All your other friends couldn't come, either, because you don't have any other friends because of how unlikable you are. It says so right here in your personnel file: "Unlikable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikable loner, whose passing shall not be mourned. Shall NOT be mourned." That's exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official. It also says you were adopted, so that's funny, too."

 There are two white doors, one the door the heaven, one is the door to hell. Once you open you may never go back. Connected to each door is a machine. One tells nothing but truths, the other nothing but lies. You do not know which is which. You have one question to find out the answer. What do you ask?




ANSWER:
"What would the other machine say is the door to heaven?"
and do the opposite. 




 Was that a pun you sly bastard? 




 Not a teacher but another kid in elementary school went on for about 5 minutes about his brother's wet dreams. Didn't really know what they were at the time, all I remember was the vivid hysterical laughter of the teacher as she ran out of the classroom.

 All straight men can agree we have a natural desire for the female breast, why? They are not a reproductive organ and only real purpose is to breast feed. Is it just something to play with or is it just something we have all agreed to be attractive?

 The diet of a gay horse does not differ from that of a straight horse. That being said it is uncommon for two male or two female horse to be sexually attracted to each other, as it goes against their genetic drive to reproduce. The usual farm diet of a horse can be split into two parts: structural (fiber) and non structural (sugars and starches). Naturally the horse needs complete access to a fresh water source and an open plain. 

The following article should have sufficient information for those looking into the proper diet and nutrition for their horse:

 Now that PKA is taking a step in the more professional route I think it's time for an intro. Most of the videos lately start with Woody saying "Ok, we're recording" which is fine but I think a cool intro like Woody has had on his channel uploads over the years would be better. Just a suggestion, I thought would be nice for the show. Maybe it could be a Patreon milestone or be added to the current animator hiring one, or maybe some guys on the sub-Reddit want to post ideas or videos. I'm trying to take a page out of Woody's book and leave solutions to problems, not just problems. Just a thought, I want to know what you guys think.

 Thanks, the river turned out great, I'm glad you like it. I'm getting some more fish soon and I think your right with the white rocks. They stand out too much that it takes away from looking at the fish. All I need now is some more fish! 




 A wall paper I put as a background, thought it looked kinda fish themed. It's weird but it's better than seeing cables and wires. 




 Right now I just have fake plants in there but once the tank is established and I have more fish in there maybe I'll swap some props with real plants. I'll have to do more research on it though. 




 Thanks! I'm getting some more fish soon, I just need to get the chemicals right and let the bacteria build up to keep up with more ammonia from more fish. I'm still very new to fish keeping so I don't really know what kind I want but I have a great local store which will give me some great fish next time I'm there.

 I hear what your saying, I just don't think it's right to point out that wings progress may not be as good as everyone is making it out to be. He's still making a lot of progress and kicking ass while doing it. 









 His cheek bones look more prominent and he's much happier. We should stop focusing on how much weight he's loosing but rather that he is making an active effort to make a lifestyle change and needs our love and support. Who cares if Woody may have cherry picked a bad and good photo to use, they are giving their moral support and that's what matters. 




 He wrestled in high school and college, you can look it up pictures of him. You would think you were looking at a young Mike Tyson.
