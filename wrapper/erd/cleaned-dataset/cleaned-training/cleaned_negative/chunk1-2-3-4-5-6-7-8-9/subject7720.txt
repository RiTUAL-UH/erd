 so i dont know how many people know what a pack to power is, but i am doing one, and i figured since my home town is tapped out i would try the wonderful redditors.  now im abit more ambitious as im trying to get all 9 as opposed to one peice and possibly a set of each duel any way you can find my pack with each trade here: http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/showthread.php?t=408779

 very far shot, but the bat computer is a very powerful machine and the d.c.u. obviously uses alien tech, so i think that the bat computer and thus batman have access to Wikipedia in our world and thats how it has so much info on everything because its been written beforehand 




 my money is on the undertaker being he normally is around in the back, and vince would listen to him plus ive heard taker say hell in a hand basket lots of times on air

 /r/mtgtournylve come or don't no pressure  




 discuss tournaments or deck critique  









 they use the lights, and each person they have attacked save ryback has had a beef with him previously
 




 what if the sheild is working for the undertaker as well as paul heyman? 




 say i have two wild beastmasters in play and i blood rush one of them do the effects of the blood rush continue to stack with the two beastmasters bouncing off of one another? 




 So heres the deal, i have never really lived in a larger city before and i have no idea what im getting into.  I am very into table top games and movies.  so with that in mind where would i go to meet like minded people and make new friends who are down to sling some cardbored or roll some dice? 
























 awesome when i clicked the tweet there was no pic still awesome though 




 i dont know how to post a screen shot of his twitter but he said he was doing something with sting in june anyone have any info on this? 









 i think the colors might be off lol 




 lol 




 i was figuring with a vote by the comunity as to what goes in  









 punk dissaperes into the earn comes back a month later claiming he has found a higher power, becomes a student of the undertaker, undertaker passes punk the dark powers 









 what if... and bear with me here, what if wwe is doing the things it does with john cena to anger the iwc?   what if all the superman stuff is to make cena a meta heel, one that is specifically pushed to make a certain fan base angry,  he is over with casual wrestlers yes but that was probably the plan all along, get over with the casual and do what ever you can to anger the smarks... eh just a thought 









 i really want to do commissions because it seems more fun than just drawing them and keeping them around lol 
























 i would disagree, wizards already puts out the basis for magic the gathering as an animated property with its set trailers,  animated does not necessarily mean for children,  look how clone wars is done or avatar,  you can have serious themes like war and politics with humor and it still be an amazing show.  that being said magic's already expansive cast of characters would be amazing on screen, plus planeswalker action figures 




 i was thinking more along the lines of a show based on the lore of the game as opposed to the game itself 




 So i was watching the mtg set trailers, and it made me want a magic cartoon series soooo badly.  does anyone else want one as well? 




 do yo think that there could be a viable t.v. series of fear street marketed to the older teen aged crowd?  ghosts of fear street is still my favorite series of books to this day 




 again when ours were opened i saw two u/b walkers come from the same pack and several other instances of random in the seed pack,  mine was random 




 saw one opened not two hours ago and a r/g pw and elspeth in it 




 those of you opening the pre-re packs they are random not predetermined like previously thought 




 its an animated short that feels very much like D d and its silent, i saw it posted here before but i cant remember the name 




 actually i do classic enchantress g/w with armadillo cloak and ancestral masks 














 i think he is a free agent 





























 Forgive my grammar first off. If rob zombie wanted to make a movie where the victim is the story he should have made it a spin off of his own universe. Instead he decided to take an established continuity and shit all over it  




 home room, very underrated classic 




 Do we know what the free games for march are? 




 i was reading Youtube comments and there was alot of hate for, can any of you give me the reason? 




 i wouldn't call her ugly,  she is one of the most beautiful people i have had the privilege to watch.  in a world so defined by outward appearance its refreshing to see someone with such an amazing personality  




 id say Halloween 5 after, Michael Myers gets shot to shit and such and falls into the river and the old guy finds him and nurses him back to health 









 Really wanting to break into that line of work,  Dont need to get paid.  just a way to the project.  sorry if i posted wrong i, wasn't sure how to make this kind of post

 So i am D.M.ing a game in Gotham city, where my players are police and other Gothamites, and though i have found a few decent songs for the world i was wondering if this fine community would be willing to offer some suggestions, also any thoughts on what system to use for said game would be very helpful
