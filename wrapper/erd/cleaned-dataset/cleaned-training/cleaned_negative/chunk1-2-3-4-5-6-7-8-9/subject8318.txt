 Possibly dumb question but I've never figured it out: How does one download a fan edit? It doesn't seem like links are openly available. Do you have to purchase a bootleg DVD or something?
 




 As someone who was born in 1994, this was actually pretty mindblowing to me how that presented these "new technologies." I guess this was cutting edge!

 Ever wonder if religion could be totally wrong, but there is in fact a divine power behind the workings of the universe? 




 Nice, I'll definitely check out those shows! I love that kind of stuff. And I've heard so much about A Brief History of Time, I'll try to grab a copy. Thanks. 




 Hi guys, I posted this. I've been having some very grown-up thoughts lately. I'm 20 years old, and I've been an atheist as long as I can remember. I, like what seems like most people on the internet, always thought that religion is stupid.


This year, I've been revisiting some of my ideals. I became obsessed with space after watching 2001, the Cosmos, Contact, and Interstellar. The way I viewed the universe started to change. Are the scriptures all just gypsies and fairies, or is there any truth to be found? What is beyond the universe, and why did we come into existence? It's almost like I went full circle with my beliefs. Concepts that always seemed impossible to me now make more sense than ever. Marijuana and the art of film has given me a newfound spirituality. Pi and The Last Temptation of Christ gave me remarkable insight into what religion actually could mean. I thought that believing in God was close-minded. Now I wonder: is being an atheist the real close-mindedness? Shutting out all religious ideas doesn't seem 100% logical to me.


So tell me: ***Does God Exist?*** Has anyone else struggled with their sense of religious identity before? If anyone has any good science to bring to the discussion, that'd be great. Think philosophically, atheists. What lies beyond? Nothing? What could lie beyond? Could our consciousness transcend this dimension into another? Could extraterrestrial life be our biblical "God"?


Thank you! (I love having my mind blown!) :) 




 Does God Exist? *Could* a God Exist? I'd love mature opinions on the subject.

 I was a leasing agent for an apartment complex in Tempe, and the sales techniques they taught us to sucker rich college kids into signing contracts were very unethical. But maybe all sales are like that. Pure *evil.*

 This! Even in the Lost World, Isla Sorna was totally abandoned. It would be great to see a story of the hurricane hitting the island and seeing shit hit the fan as workers try to get off the island as dinosaurs begin to break loose. I always felt like Isla Sorna was a more ambitious project than the '93 Isla Nublar. I want to see it before it was hit by the storm.

 I'm trying to find more videos like [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSCrre45vCE)

It reminds me of some sick fever dream I might have had as a child. I wouldn't mind getting stoned and watching something similar to this. Anybody know of any other videos like this? 




 Oh my GOD! I LISTENED TO THAT SONG SO MANY TIMES IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL!!! 5th grade, 2005, specifically! I really thought it was Weird Al. Me and my buddy used to jam out to this in his shed when we first learned how to use the internet on our own. There was a YTMND and I remember finally finding an mp3 of it and being so happy. My parents didn't like it when I sang it at the dinner table. Haha I'm so happy you made this post. Thank you, catthedd. You had an influence on some young children in Arizona. 




 Am I the only person that feels bad for her? I don't like how police officers are so ruthless. 




 I kind of like it. It's charming. 




 I believe you. I don't necessarily believe they stole your story per se, but I actually know a few people that have also written scripts for Jurassic Park IV that are eerily similar to Jurassic World. I think a lot of people have a lot of the same ideas of what they would want to see in a new JP film.

 I've never been more depressed from a movie. I hated it. I don't know why anybody would enjoy it. 
























 Damn lucky. I wish something like that was in Phoenix (or literally anywhere in AZ). I checked on ebay and they're going from $90-$800. Anybody know of any other options for someone to get a copy? A past time of mine is to chill and look at look books(I recommend the free Vans look books you can get at the Vans stores). Any clever ideas?? Any high quality scans? High quality printer shops? If somebody reads this and has any ideas where I can get stuff like this, I would love you. 3
thanks fam

edit: I might even want to compile high quality scans of look books for people to DL. Print media is awesome. I want to get my hands on the Odd Future look books too.

 If the grandparents are cool, why does it matter 




 This is from the leaked Steve McQueen-directed All Day music video. It's like a 9 minute video (all one take) where Kanye is rapping All Day, then he sits down and sings this. He showed off the video in Paris a few weeks ago.

 It makes me frustrated that there's such an emphasis on the NSFW for language... 




 Why does everyone hate Cruel Summer?? 




 All the decorations in my room. They're all kinda shitty and cheap, but I accumulate a lot of memories over the years. For example, I have a samurai sword that's falling apart. My brother gave it to me when I left to college, and I kept it on display at my dorm. 

I got really stoned once and watched Breakfast at Tiffany's for the first time and I thought it was so cool I immediately went out and bought a big poster of Audrey Hepburn. I moved back home and I still have it above my bed, even though my family gives me strange looks.  




 Happier. 




 MBDTF, Cruel Summer, College Dropout, Yeezus, WTT, 808s, Late Registration, Graduation

i really like cruel summer...

seems like it's pretty clear that everyone thinks MBDTF is a masterpiece. 




 I should be diggin for dino DNA 
























 I want to see more dialogue from other characters. I really liked that MTV special of Pratt and Howard. I don't really want to be spoiled with more dinosaur footage. I want to see more humans. The cast in this film is so ace. 









 I would hope that he did that. All Day goes hard and all, but it feels stiff. Didn't I read somewhere that Kanye recorded a lot of versions of that song and eventually picked the most safe one to use as a single? 




 that's awesome! good work 




 The tequila banter was awesome. Gave me a sensible chuckle. Really excited to see some playfulness in the dialogue! 




 got that same vibe 




 I get what you're saying. But I feel like JP3 is just a monster movie. There's something missing.

 Haven't read TLW yet. 




 Exactly. 

Spielberg: "You know what would make this dinosaur movie kick even more ass? Bring the T-rex to San Diego, motherfucker$" 




 I gotta go with The Lost World, man. People are hard on it, but I loved it so much when I was a kid. The Lost World is an absolutely badass movie. To me, it's like the *Aliens* of the Alien franchise. 

I remember going to the theaters to see JP3 when I was 7 and thinking it just wasn't as good as the first and second. I was really young, but I knew. I felt it in my heart. It didn't have the magic that Spielberg brought to the table. 




 Dang!! Are copies of Operation Genesis that rare? Do you think my copy is worth a lot of money or something? Not that I'm trying to sell it, too fond of memories. 




 You need to get JP on bluray! 




 Came here to post this. :)

 +1 for Jaws 3 comparison.  




 He's someone who takes himself very seriously. He is a very talented artist. I think his overconfidence has caused him to say a lot of things that have gotten him into trouble. But it also causes him to create a product and a message that he truly believes is God-like. The loyal consumer appreciates how seriously he takes himself because it means he ALWAYS presents a good product. I think he feels like he has something to prove because he is one of the most hated men in the world, while simultaneously being one of the most admired and influential artists. He's kind of a weirdo. He's always saying stupid shit(you know it's true...) But it's a hell of an interesting story to see this eccentric family (Kanye   the Kardashians) trying to live normal lives in a a world where they a preyed on by the media. I personally think Kanye is so awesome and I admire his story.  I love how Kanye has had such a tough time with the media.  It's like he's in a constant war with the media over the status of his reputation. He's a fighter. I like that. And his music is fucking awesome and genre-defining. And I think he has good taste. I think some of the Adidas line is awesome. He's a real artist. And he has a crippling ego. But I don't blame him; I bet it's way more fun to live that way. I'd choose to live like a God, too. Wouldn't you? 




 The T-Rex paddock scene and where that 100-foot drop off came from. 




 Ha, right? He's just a kid!! Leave him alone and let him be. Want to see a *real* douche? Join a fraternity. The only difference is the media doesn't profit off of frat boys' douchey-ness.  




 Also, it's been circulating in the news that Bieber is the fifth most hated person in the world right now. They just filmed his roast and I heard he took it as constructive criticism. Now don't tell me that doesn't sound a little bit like Kanye after the Swift VMA's.

I can imagine that Kanye and Justin are actually pretty similar.  




 Haaa I snorted out my water.

 this interview is awesome. Thanks! 




 Eeek! This looks dooooooope! 




 Listen to Mac Demarco. Do it. Do it. Do it. 









 That is exactly how I reacted. 




 oh another thing i wanted to say about For the Kids is that the letterboxing really adds to the cinematic feel. Looks great! I think I want to do that on my next film instead of the basic ass 16x9. 




 I'm not sure of the exact model, but our cinematography used a camera slider for most of the better looking shots. Google it, there are even some cheap DIY builds. Also a shoulder mount  




 ay, thanks dude. worked hard on it :-) 




 Check out the film I posted on here, Simplicity, when you have time. It's not quite as funny though. Or at all. In fact it's rather depressing. 




 Haha this was awesome. Love the twisted sense of humor. 









 Yo, this is a pretty dope shirt! Where did you get them if you didn't make it? 




 "You're history."

man i hope that line is in jurassic world. 




 Contact is my favorite alien film!! :-) 




 It's not *that* far out, but Hitler and the Occult is a pretty interesting short documentary that talks about Hitlers religious beliefs. It's kinda cool. It gives you the impression that Hitler truly thought that he was a messiah of some sort. 




 Sorry. I didn't know my opinion would get downvoted. I just get the feeling that Kanye cringes every time he hears that song. It's a product of its time.  




 RAMPAGE EDITION 




 Ahh! The one on the left was one of my favorite toys growing up! Oh man, the nostalgia is hitting so hard. Thanks OP 




 Came here to post these exact words. You're cool. 




 Ah man, that reminds me that I'm actually banned from fat people hate. 




 I seriously hate Stronger. It's the only Kanye song that I really dislike. Sadly, it's the only Kanye song that I ever seem to hear on the radio and it drives me crazy. 




 Damn, that was beautiful. 
























 That's a big argument my friend group is having right now. On one hand, 3D can be distracting. On the other, this is a HUGE movie and a really important first-time viewing experience for us hardcore Jurassic Park fans. IMAX 3D, maybe? idk yet. 




 I am so FUCKING horrible at the battles! I was stuck on Level 9 for like three weeks. I've been having to invest a ton of time into planning out my next battle because I realized I needed a new team, but of course it takes FOREVER for me to get enough meat   coin to level anything up! Now I'm out of DNA so I can't buy any more dinosaurs so I can evolve the ones I already have! GAHHH it's so frustrating, fuck this game. Give me Operation Genesis 2. 




 Pretty cool video. Not my favorite Kanye verse, but it was cool. The photothot line tho! hahahah jesus.. 




 Rella by odd future 




 I get what you're saying. There are some songs by Kanye that I *really* don't like but I can turn around and find someone who thinks that song is a masterpiece. 




 This is probably what she meant when she said it was going to be a major SWISH 




 Cheers, mate! Been drinking and just started GoT as well. Lovving It! blessed be you, child 




 Haha too many spoilers. Just clicked on it and it was the finale of Jurassic World. NOPE! Didn't watch. What do you mean your worst fears are coming true? See something you didn't like? 




 ok 




 Oh my god, at 2:00 I almost felt like crying. That was beautiful. 




 Haha this is so bad, yet so amazing. 




 Still think it's kinda fun! I have a Jurassic Park in my pocket, I ain't complaining. (it's free! :D) 




 He doesn't mention anything about the wild raptors, leaving me to assume there aren't any. Bummer :(

I really wanted to see some vicious velociraptor stuff like in the last act of Jurassic Park. 




 It's exactly like in Jurassic Park, "The voice you are hearing is Richard Kiley! We spared no expense." On the tour. 




 I had that toy! It was an easter gift! Oh my god I'm crying  




 me irl 




 Hahahaha this is the best thing I've seen all day. 




 A student got to *intern* with him? I'm so fucking jealous. Goddamnit. 




 I think it's sus. He feels the Grammys are beneath him. 




 I think it's the I-Rex hatching as well as possibly it eating the sibling? 




 That was awesome. OH MY GOD IS IT JUST SPRINTING TOWARDS THE BATHROOM??

Hahahahaha I lost it, dude.

edit: when he spotted the bathroom... so relatable.  




 I'm really hoping that we've still seen only very little of this movie. What if the T-rex vs. I-rex scene is only halfway through the movie, just like the T-rex scene is halfway through the first Jurassic Park.

Ah, I doubt it. A boy can dream. The marketing on this probably has shown a clip from every scene of the movie. 




 Do you think Roshe Runs are ugly, too? 




 Haha I don't know if he drinks..but he smokes hella trees. That's all he really talks about. 




 I don't remember reading anything about Site B after Jurassic Park III. Has it been mentioned at all on the Jurassic World website? Any predictions on whether or not they'll talk about it in Jurassic World? 




 Mmm, my bad. Haha I thought I made such an awesome point. 




 Apollo flew too close to the sun. Got burnt. I'd say Kanye has pushed things too far many times, which is why public opinion is negative towards him. He flew too close to the sun.
