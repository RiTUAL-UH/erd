 It was more or less improvised. But not that complicated at all: cook the sushi rice (add some sugar, rice vinegar, salt) and let it chill.
Meanwhile cut all the other ingredients in little cubes and add a egg yolk. Then add the rice, form little balls (if you like put in the middle of some of them a little piece of feta cheese) and roll them in  a mix of flour, starch and sesame und deepfry them until they have a nice colour.

 celsius?! or this strange measurement unit based on a very cold winter in england ? ;) 




 You're right had to throw it away :/ 
























 I guess you got me there...^^ 




 red sauce (on the beef) : i made caramel and deglazed it with vinegar and worcestersauce added some ketchup and let it cook briefly and season with green pepper. 

the white sauce (for the salad) : just mix mayonaise,  	rough-textured mustard, salt, vinegar, white pepper.

 




 yeah but hey i made the bun ! 
























 it was my gfs idea to write "from the scratch" ... now i just hate myself :/ 




 They were easy to made and tasted well but took over 2h to make it 
(the most of the time you have to wait). 




 Had to google for sloppy joes, I kind feel pain when I see these 'burgers'.
