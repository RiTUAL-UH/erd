 Could you imagine looking at people and seeing them as 2d representations in a 3d space? Think paper mario/dukenukem 3d. Holy shitballs weird. 




 I enjoyed bc1 more than bc2. But nostalgia does that. Vehicles like the golf buggy were obviously map specific and you had the tanks and light vehicles. The maps had a more "designed for multiplayer" feel about them and not as natural/realistically structured as in bc2. 




 Until they ruin bc3, I still have hope. 




 There was levity. Troops would joke with each other and you could cut sick in a golf buggy [bc1] or a quad [bc2]. It wasn't "This a super cereal mission. Look at this palette of blue, black and grey-foreboding isn't it?"

BC tried to be just a game and not a war simulator
