 Jesus.   I didn't tell them anything that wasn't public knowledge.   But I won't respond to the idiots anymore.  

Thank you.  




 There are two different types of mod-removal actions.   They are called "Spam" and "Remove".    Your comment [looks like this](http://imgur.com/ADoQdfa) too me.   Submissions have the same removal options. 

If I click spam, it removes the comment and the spam filter learns that a moderator dislikes you and remembers that bit of info for future reference.     If I click remove, it just removes your comment but doesn't remember it for future reference.  

As to what the spam filter learns in these *spam* cases, is open to question.   Does it key on your username? Or that I removed a comment with the phrase "shed some light on it"?   Not sure if it learns either of those things, both, or something else entirely.   From observations I have made, I think it's the third option. But even that's just a bit of a educated hypothesis.    




 Defeating Link redirectors is old hat.  The admins have blacked holed more than a few of them via the soft and hard domain ban lists they manage.   Of those that aren't 100% blocked by the admins,  There are some standard Automod rules that block a good number of the remaining redirect domains.  




 It specifically says "for this page may edit".  So that seems to be how it works.  

The standard subreddit settings wiki-settings [look like this](http://i.imgur.com/h1SMc16.png), which says "Only mods, approved wiki contributors, or those on a page's edit list may edit", which is three separate classes.  If the second and third meant the same thing, I don't think they would both be mentioned.   




 Yes, it's possible to give a wiki-page in your sureddit different permissions than you default permissions.    [See this image](http://i.imgur.com/LhlhuPk.png). 

Change the permissions on your page.   Just give some specific mods the rights to "only approved wiki contributors for this page may edit", and don't add any.   Mods will still be able to edit it, and since there is no one else on the access list for that specific page, regular subreddit approved submitters won't be able to edit it.   




 What if I want to used "Rule #6" for the list in the mod log, and drop a mod comment that says "I'm sorry, but we don't allow [insert domain name here] in /r/example_subreddit".    

Rule #6 is meaningless to the user, and the later is too long for the mod log. 

Also, sometimes mods don't want to tell the user it was removed at all.  As often we block domains that we view as always spam in all situations.   Since, by definition in this example, the  submitter is a spammer, we don't want to notify them that Automod had stopped them.   Sure, it's easy for people to figure it out if they know what to look for, but most spammers never actually bother to check.     So, if I don't want to communicate the information, I shouldn't be forced to communicate the information. 
 




 You aren't the only one excited by that.    Some moderators I'm sure are now feeling *fully functional*.   




 I was going to look that up.   But thank you, that made my job easier.   I only even thought of it after randoh12 mentioned it.   It's not a normal thing I use in Automod.    




 I mod several subreddits with extensive Approved Submitter lists.   Some run in the multiple thousands.   I don't think there is a limit.  




 I should mention that Automod does have the feature to block certain Youtube channels.   Similar to a domain block or a user Automod-ban.  I don't use that feature much, as most Youtube spammers I find use different channels all the time.   That's my experience anyway.   




 I'm a mod of /r/History.  So, trust me when I say this. But 16th Century Spain had way too many Papists for 1950's Birmingham to be comfortable with.   Really doesn't matter which Birmingham you might be talking about either.    




 You realize that 1950's Birmingham would have claimed they weren't 16th century Spain.   




 Yeah, it was a simple ~100 year period when Whites only did business with White owned businesses in the post-Civil War South.   That wasn't a long time at all.   The market will sort everything out.   




 That would be better directed to the mods of /r/AskReddit.   I don't see why not though.  But I don't use /r/AskReddit a lot either.   




 In the future, please don't use bot-accounts in /r/Help or similar subreddits. 

Thank you.  




 I still have some down vote bots that follow me around from events from years ago.   Know this:  The bots votes look like the register, but they don't.  The admins have probably already shadow banned the bot.  The bot doesn't know that it's been caught and stopped.   

I've discussed this topic with the admins, and they have a lot of counter measures in place when it comes to things like down vote bots.  

Contacting The [Reddit admins](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com) to let them know might be helpful for your peace of mind.  But as I already said, I'm sure they have already neutralized the idiot down voting you. 




 There are other subreddits one could ask questions at too.   /r/AskReddit and /r/Self both come to mind.  




 I removed it a few minutes ago.  See my other comment in this thread.  




 It's been removed.  

The greater context is important.   

For example, the 1952 and 1953 events with the Iranian Coup and Counter Coup are very complex.   Prime Minister Mosaddegh and the Shah were both going at each other hard.   Stalin has only very recently passed away.   Soviet Troops had occupied Northern Iran during WWII and had only pulled out a few years previously.   Also, even good histories often leave out that Ayatollah Khomeini supported the Shah in his show down with Mosaddegh.    

Same problems with the later information about Iraq.   

These are not unimportant details.   The blogspam glosses over all that.  Dare I say the author of it didn't even know about any of these details.    It's a shit piece and it's removed.     




 A better link would be [this one](http://www.dancarlin.com/product-category/hardcore-history/current-hardcore-history/).   




 I'm sorry, but your submission has been removed. This subreddit is specifically for tech support help with Reddit.    Try asking your question in /r/Gaming or a similar subreddit.  




 http://www.reddit.com/r/mod/about/log/?type=removemoderator mod=AutoModerator

Almost caused a panic attack when I first saw it.  




 You already told him to do that, Chtorrr.   It makes too much sense.  He wants to believe he's found a loophole.   He's going to get rich via this loophole, don't you know.   




 You don't want to believe the people who are telling you, fine.  Get banned.  I won't lose any sleep over you at all.  

Good bye.  




 You are playing semitics games.   Sol Invictus and the former top mod of /r/Trees tried to play that game.   They were shoved off of reddit with extreme prejudice by the admins.    




 any form of compensation

Any form of compensation of any form of compensation. 

If you don't like the rules, then don't be on Reddit.  




 No.  




 Several Northern Generals, including Winfield Scott, the man who tried to talk Robert E. Lee into leading the Union Army of the Potomac, were also from Virginia.   Scott didn't turn Traitor because he was actually a man of honor.   Can't say the same thing for Lee.    




 The Constitution of the Confederacy (mostly a cut and paste job from the original US version) banned states from ever banning slavery in the future.  They wanted to limit states rights to even consider removing slavery from their new attempted government.     

Yeah, they were so in favor of states rights that they have to limit states rights.  By which I mean states rights was never part of what the Confederacy was about until long after they lost their treasonous war.  




 Normally it forces updates when you restart your browser too.  




 Because were not free if we aren't allowed to bully people into suicide.    Obviously.   

 




 Yup.   The Confederacy believed in States rights so much that their Constitution (mostly a cut and paste job from the original US version) banned states from ever banning slavery in the future.    Yeah, they were so in favor of states rights that they needed to limit states rights.   




 I would love to see the admins shadow ban anyone who criticizes Ellen Pao.   Cause those people are totally stupid and if they vanished, the average IQ of the Reddit userbase would increase by at least 40 points.   




 What I would like to see is the raising tide of Hate-Speech dealt with.   Holocaust Deniers, Neo Nazis, Homophobes, Ethnic and Religious Hate, etc.  Sites like Storm Front are actively trying to *colonize* (their word) Reddit with their bullshit.   This is something that the Admin-team should be addressing as well.  As it often leads to groups of people who make throw-away after throw-away accounts to harass people who believe simple facts like in the reality of the Holocaust.   




 Yes, real users should notice when they are shadow banned.   Then they can message the admins and be told what they did wrong.   I know this works because I was shadow banned for a short time once.   I asked the admins, they told me what I did wrong and asked me to not repeat the mistake.   I made the promise and they unbanned me.  

I've known other users who were shadow banned and then restored.   This is not hard.   It was all rather simply.  

And Reddit is not the only  site that does shadow bans or some nature.   Some sites call them quiet bans.  Others call them shadow bans.  It's the norm for the internet. 
 




 You need to message the mods of the subreddit it was removed from.  




 It's harassment no matter who it's yelled at.   




 There is [Karma Decay](http://karmadecay.com/) and [Google Reverse image search](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808) too. 

Neither is 100%, but both can be helpful.  




 Imgur.com has a close relationship with Reddit.   But it's still not Reddit.   Not going to remove this post, but people should try the normal trouble shooting things you do when you have trouble with a site.    

* Restart your browser  /  try a different browser
* Clear your cache
* Disable any browser extensions/add-ons you are using.  

That said, I just went to imgur.com and everything was working for me.   So maybe it's a network issue with some large ISP or something.  
 




 You think mods do it for free.     Everyone knows that mods are highly paid individuals.   For example, /r/Food gets [handsome payoffs](http://s14.postimg.org/hkbso7481/cca350tonnes.jpg) from the propane and propane accessories industry.   




 Magic Mushrooms induce the euphoria.   




 So, no space aliens then.   And I was sure Bigfoot was from outer space.   Must be a time traveler instead.   




 Wow.  You think they would just answer things with catch call application of *that's how magic works*.    




 Just like Reddit moderators.     




 As you have discovered, verifying your e-mail address is important.  But some subreddits will have account age and karma-requirements as well.   If you have a problem with a specific submission not going through, you need to contact the moderators of the subreddit you're having trouble in.   They're going to be the only people who can help you.  

 




 I don't think /r/engineering has ever trended before.   That's cool.   Maybe we'll see some new subscribers from this.   New users should know we are rather strict in our approach to moderation.   




 That would be interesting.  

I have not talked to the other mods of /r/History, but I think we might be willing to voltmeter allowing other subreddits to import the use of our anti-racist/anti-nazi rules.   We have previously made some of the rules available in places like /r/Modtalk or /r/Defaultmods, but we have several more than what we have already shown.   

Myself, but especially /u/Creesch and /u/Cordis_Melum, and others, have developed some very good rules that stop most racists, Nazis, stormfronters, homophobes, ethnic and religious haters, and other associated lunatics and crazies, from having free reign of /r/History's comment section.  

So, if you need people willing to help you with stuff like that, please let us know.   

 




 The moderators here can confirm.   The admins contacted us about this ahead of time.

 Well, say one thing for the Antebellum South.  The upper class was very well dressed.    In this case, they aren't wearing pants, and that t-shirt hasn't been washed in weeks.   




 Most of the subreddits I mod have automod rules in place to remove hate speech.    It just makes the comment discussions a little better.   Not a lot better, but a little bit can go a long way sometimes.   




 I'm sorry, but I have to remove this thread.  

This is an issue between you and the admins.    They don't want to allow it,  then.... it's their web site.    




 There is no  *beginning*  of a subreddit as such.   You will have to use search and just read old threads.    




 Actually it does stop the down votes.   It doesn't let the down voter know that though.  But after a while it discounts their downvoter crusade into the great /dev/null device in the sky.    

So, it's kind of a secret prevention program.   The down voter isn't supposed to catch on and stop.   They are just supposed to waste their time and effort forever or until they stop being jack ass.   Which ever comes first.  




 You might want to message the mods of /r/photoshopbattles and tell them about it.   They can drop a mod-comment waring people, remove the comment, etc.   




 How now brown cow?   




 Man, I don't suppress known truth.  I suppress unknown truths.  For example, I keep Mathematicians from finding out that 2+2 actually equals 6.

  Enrico Fermi, Max Planck, and J. Robert Oppenheimer

Fermi, yes.  He left Europe to get away from Mussolini's fascist government.  But Planck stayed in Germany for the entire war.   And Oppenheimer was an American, born and raised.   

As to the German Rocket Scientists, when they were captured by the Allies at the end of the war, they were amazed at being asked all the questions about rockets by the Americans.  Finally asking their American handlers why would the Americans need German Rocket scientists, when it was American Robert Goddard's work they were building on.  They were amazed the the US military didn't really know who Goddard was or why he was important.    




 Do not repeat phrases from the mod-guidebook to those are who aren't cleared for the information, please.  




 It looks like a subreddit you are attempting to comment in does not allow news user accounts or those with little comment karma to comment in their subreddit.  It's probably done for spammer and troll prevention.  

These are legitimate concerns for that mod team.  You should build some comment karma elsewhere before commenting there  Or alternatively you could try and message the mods of that mod team.   But I would bet that are going to tell you to build up some comment karma elsewhere first.   




 We have the [CSS banner](http://i.imgur.com/dPC9pAF.png) at the top too.  And the [submission box text area](http://i.imgur.com/PDMkyeV.png) that explains what the subreddit is for too. 

People straight up don't pay attention to those, nor to the sidebar.    And they don't look at the content already present before hand either.   

People think "I need help with something" and then they can't think of a subreddit is should be submitted too, so they type in "help" as the name of the subreddit.   

When the mods find these inappropriate submissions, we remove them.   Normally we give suggestions about where the submission would find a better home too.   Sometimes they are so crazy that we're even at a loss for where they should go.   Where were thinking "why would you even post  that on the internet?"

If you see a submission that shouldn't be here, please report it or [message the mod-team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fhelp).    We'll remove it then.  

Thank you.  




 Unsubscribe from it.   




 Message the [Reddit admins](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com).   There is something wrong with your account.   Your post (This post I am replying too) does not appear on your [user overview](http://www.reddit.com/user/leadguit).   You are not shadow banned.   So, there must be something wrong with your account.  




 I've seen instances where it doesn't do that if you aren't a mod of the subreddit.     I'm not exactly sure what causes it in those cases.   




 I'm thinking that the spam filter ate his comment for some reason.  If I'm right, the mods of /r/Minecraft are who he needs to talk too.   




 Did you old browser settings cache your password?  If so, you should be able to get Firefox or Chrome to tell you want it thinks your Reddit password is.  Then you can use it.   

If not, sorry, but since you didn't associate your account with an e-mail address, there is no other way to reset your password in a way where Reddit knows for sure that your account is you.

They should produce the same results, but both are formed a little different.    




 Glad I could help.   I use the hosts file to block a lot of advertisement-only domains.    




 Hosts files are an an old way, from pre-DNS days, that computers did IP lookups.  

I'm going to assume your running Windows on your machine.  The hosts file is probably located at:

* %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

Which is probably C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts for you.  

If there is an entry for reddit.com in that file, then your system is going to always assume is reddit.com is that IP address, no matter what DNS thinks.    Now a days, the host file is usually used to assign things to localhost so that your system doesn't try to visit them.  This can be used as a way to prevent a system from visiting potentially harmful sites.   They are also something that somebody can use to block users from visiting web sites for other reasons, because most regular users don't know about it's existence.   




 Browser add-ons, software on the computer, does the localhost file blackhole reddit maybe?     Is it a a work-machine where your workplace computer techs may have blocked Reddit with the use of software that blocks it?    I know that some of my employers have blocked sites like Myspace and Facebook.  




 Sounds like network problems from whoever is your internet provider.    Your phone would use your cell-phone providers network, which travels a different route to Reddit.  




 It's allowed.   That said, it is sometimes considered to be against the spirit of [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).   Depends on the subreddit, and the opinions of the mods as to whether they allow it.   When in doubt, message the mods ahead of time. 
 




 Because it's going to automatically submit something, you should clear that plan with The [Reddit admins](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com) before implementing it.   That seems very close to spamming.     

That said, there are people who know how to implement bots, such as /u/Deimorz, /u/multi-mod and /u/creesch who all know to make them work.   I'm not sure if any of them have written a how-to guide, but one of them may have.  




 Those are some bitter nuts.   




 It's been 9-months, so I am not sure what you can do now.   That said, if you think your account has been compromised, message the [Reddit admins](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com).   I'm sure they will be happy to look into the issue.  




 I'm sorry, but your submission has been removed.   This subreddit is for tech support help with Reddit.   I would suggest asking your question at /r/photoshop or /r/Images instead. 

Thank you.  




 Users can do that.   That's a moderator option.   You can message the mods of the subreddit and ask them to make the change for the thread though.   




 The mods of the subreddit are the only people who can help you.   That said,  sometimes it takes a while for moderators to get back to people.   If you haven't heard back after 24-hours, just politely message them again.  

 




 I'm sorry, but this post has been removed.   This subreddit is for help with Reddit.   I'm not really sure where one would ask about Lawn Mowers on Reddit.   /r/lawncare maybe?   

Thank you.   




 This post shows on your overview and it has not been removed.   If there are other submissions that are not showing up on your overview page, it would be because you deleted them.   Mod-removals don't make things disappear from your user overview.  

But one last thing you should check is /u/me/hidden area.   See if you hid anything from yourself.  That shouldn't remove it from your user overview, but I'm trying to think of other things you can check.   
 




 You mean your user overview?  

/u/me should take you there.   Or just click your username.  




 I don't think you can.

That said, sometimes it's a regular user who is just being weird and dislikes everything for the moment.   




 Reddit search doesn't search comments.  It never has.

 If it's not Zombie Stalin, he's too much of a sell-out to them.   And even Zombie Stalin would have people complaining about him being a sell-out for hoping on Corp Americans current Zombie band wagon.   I can see it now "Even Stalin whores himself to Madison Avenue's Corp-created fashion trends".  

Where as I would worry more than my name might be on a little list in Zombie Stalin's pocket of people who have to go to make room for the Zombie Revolution.  




 Or you could get a little karma, where the issue becomes moot.  It's not hard.   This is a change the admins implemented to stop spammers who were using it to get around other spam prevention tools.  




 [See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/2yob6r/creating_a_subreddit/).

In short, somewhat recent changes to subreddit creation requirements, you need karma to create subreddits.

 Maybe he just wasn't seeing it earlier.   




 You sure?   He had config earlier.   He has since gotten the access permissions.   I assume he has access to the stylesheet menu now.   




 There are stores in my area that have signs that say they card everyone.  It's because the stores want to make it is simple of the teenagers they hire to figure out who they should card.   Just tell them "Card everybody, no matter what".     

It's one-size-fits-all management because they don't want to face possible fines or even just hassle from law enforcement.   




 The page must be changing dynamically based on where my request is coming from.  I don't have the ability to watch it on that page.    I only get the opportunity to purchase it on iTunes for $12.99.   Pages that do that stink.   




 No, it doesn't.   It says "Watch Clips From the Film".   Those are just snippets from it.  The documentary only aired two days ago.   Not months back.   




 None of those are to the documentary though.   Trailer and an Info page and a dead link.   The documentary originally aired only two days ago.  




 That seems to indicate the issue is no longer manifesting then.  




 Could you provide a link to the original please?  

Thank you. 

 




 When I reply now does the mail icon light up?   




 Messages from Shadow banned accounts only show up to moderators in mod mail.   Mods will also see any comments they might make in threads in their own subreddits.   But users won't see the shadow banned accounts PM's.   And users will only see comments from the shadow banned if a mod has approved said comment.  




 No problem.

 You are sorting the comments by New.   Change it to either Best or Top. 

Also, check your [preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/) and check what you have "comment options" | "sort comments by" set too.   Again, probably best to choose either Top or Best depending on what you like.   I prefer Top, but the Admins recommend Best for most people.   




 Why is everyone always horrified of Clippy?   The one I truly fear is [Microsoft Bob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bob).   Bob was the most diabolical software creation in all history.   




 Any update on when this issue might be fixed?   




 It's possible somebody off-reddit shared the link.   On another site, maybe Facebook, Twitter, etc.   Which would then not be something Reddit search would know about.  




 [Look here](http://i.imgur.com/gY33ELB.png).

Wait, I think I see the problem.  You don't have full permissions on [that subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/spongebobfnaf/about/moderators).   If I recall correctly, you need either the access or wiki rights.  I don't remember which. 

As your top-mod for those rights.    




 I know people on both sides of this one.  I am still confused as to what actually happened.  I know enough about Reddit drama to know that not all the information is out here and generally known.   There is definitely something else at play here that is not known outside of their politics_mod subreddit.  

I know Luster and TheRedditPope and mod with them at places.  They are good mods and good people.  I also know noeatnosleep and mod with him as well.   He is also a fine moderator and a good person. 

I don't like seeing all the people condemning Luster and Pope when I am sure there is more to this drama.   I really have to think that this is a giant misunderstanding where nobody wanted to back down for some reason or other.   Hopefully everyone makes up soon and they all get back to moderating their subreddit.    




 That whole job of adding mods there was you and me and a few stray comments from a few others.    But we found a good collection of guys who now do most of the daily work.  I mod /r/Apple mostly from mod mail now and let the newbies (who aren't all that new anymore) run the day to day things like Stricky threads and the like.   




 It's was a big surprised considering that 1964 Republican Party Platform, which was not written by Nixon's people.   It was written by Goldwater's guys and some of Reagan's future team, who were then working for the Senator from Arizona.  




 Lets just remember, more than half the Senate (then) Democrats who voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Bill, by 1976 were registered Republicans.   The Republican Party welcomed the likes of Strom Thurmond and a bunch of the others with open arms.   To the point that you guys were celebrating their careers and saying Thurmond should have been elected President in 1948....  because he was against the anti-Lynching law.  He was out and out 100% openly pro-murder and the Republicans welcomed him into their party. 

Also, the 1964 Republican Nominee for President (Barry Goldwater) and the 1964 Republican Party Platform was anti-Civil Rights.  

Anyone who was welcomed into the Republican Party, who retired from politics as a Republican, should be counted as a Republican in those statistics.  You are just using Statistics to lie to people about Reality.  

The Democrats threw those jack asses out of the Democratic Party.  The Republicans welcomed them and celebrated them.   




 If somebody mentions more than three usernames in a comment, nobody get's a message about the username mention.  That's a measure put in place by the admins to prevent their user as a spam tool.  




 If you think you have a down voter that is doing it for nefarious purposes, then you should ask the [Reddit admins](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com) to look into the situation.   That said, sometimes it's a regular user who is just being weird and dislikes everything for the moment.   




 Karma is also rather easy to get.   All you need to do is submit a few things on occasion.     This morning I submitted about 10-15 news stories about various topics.    I read the news each morning, and when I found things I thought were a little interesting, I submitted them to /r/News, /r/Politics, /r/Worldnews and a few other subreddits.   

If news isn't your think,   /r/Funny, /r/Pics, /r/AdviceAnimals and the SFW-porn subreddits exist for most images, among several other subreddits.  

Offbeat weird internet things can submitted to /r/WTF, /r/nottheonion, /r/Offbeat, /r/NewsoftheStupid and /r/NewsoftheWeird.  

Those are just  three categories out of the whole of Reddit.   There are 49+2 [default subreddits](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/05/whats-that-lassie-old-defaults-fell.html) out there, plus a lot of sizable non-default subreddits.  The [100-largest subreddits](http://redditmetrics.com/top) are all 300K+ users now.  And there currently are 362 subreddits with more than 100K subscribers.  

There is something out there for everyone.   People just need to check it out and submit to those subreddit-communities that interest them.   If they do that, karma will come to them.   

 




 Want to mention [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/2yob6r/creating_a_subreddit/), as it addresses this issue a little more in-depth.  




 [I miss Warren Zevon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0FaVI9ae24).   




 From [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq#wiki_why_am_i_being_told_.22you.27re_doing_that_too_much....22) in the /r/Help FAQ:

Karma is stored (internally) on a per-subreddit basis; if you are new to a subreddit, you'll have to be patient. The delay will decrease as your karma in that subreddit increases and it only takes a fairly small amount of positive karma before the timer will turn off. This applies to both posts and comments. You can also get the timer turned back on if you make a lot of negatively voted posts/comments.

So, yes.... it is in there.   




 Never compare yourself to Jesus.   People who like Jesus get pissed about things like that, and people who don't like Jesus don't like Jesus.     




 In the future, please [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fapple) about things like this.  We will remove them.  

It's removed now.  

Thank you.  




 If that's happening, I would suspect that you have some browser add-ons that are doing something you don't expect them to do. 

For the moment, I would suggest you open parent permalinks via new-tabs rather than just clicking them. 

Not sure what else is going on, sorry.  




 Sorry, but no.   Only the submitter can edit it. 

That said, many subreddits create a shared-mod account that they often use for posting mod-announcements.   Anyone who knows the password can log into it and use it, including to edit the older mod-announcements.   In most cases, these kind of shared accounts are used specifically for this ability.   




 in the Subreddit Settings, look for Content Options.  [See here](http://imgur.com/UMNMDjA).

 You are welcome to build a time machine and warn Spez and Kn0thing back in 2005.  




 Just want to point out that this is addressed in the [/r/Help FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq). 




 It's been that way for 9+ years.   For all that time there have been some people who complain about it.  It's left in place because there isn't a better solution for the issue in many cases.   A bad solution that works 90% of the time is better than no-solution that doesn't stop any spam.   




 If the parent comment to the one you are clicking is on the page, it just jumps to the #tag location on the page.   If it's not on the current page, then it needs to load the URL to the permalink for it.   




 Admin /u/xiongchiamiov commented on this issue on this thread:

They are working on a fix for it.  Not sure where that is at in he pipe-line though.    But the admins are aware of it.   




 The rate limit has existed on Reddit since it was founded.   It is a simple way to prevent spam.   




 One of two issues is at play. 

* The mods of that subreddit need to approve it.   You would need to write to them to find out if they are willing to approve it.   
* You may be shadow banned on your (other, I assume) account.  In that case, the admins are the only people who can help you.  The number one reason get shadow banned is for spamming.   You might want to read the following rules of Reddit:
 * [Reddit Rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/)
 * [Spam Rules](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)
 * [Self Promotion Rules](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion)
 * [The reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

 If the government wanted to make sure nothing from /r/conspiracy made the front page of Reddit.com, I think calling up the admins and saying "We will give you $20 million to make sure /r/conspiracy never makes the front page".    If you are going to live in a conspiracy-world, that's so much easier than anything else.   

And if I was an admin, I would take that deal because nothing of value would be lost.

 Come on, everyone knows you only got to be a moderator via magic powers.   You hypnotized people into making you a moderator.    

Just like me.  
 




 The guy from 60 Minutes I miss the most is Ed Bradley.   He was great.  




 With a side of butt hurt.  




 I'm /u/Bechus, and AL is /u/ProbablyHittingOnYou.    




 Team..... Can't they just use the proper name: Mossad Golem Project Ice Cream Foundation.     




 That guy is such a big old evil agent of Mossad.    I heard he ate a live baby once.   




 Dude, I'm just with Mossad.   To find out if Rito is an arm of the NSA you'll need to check with /u/Agentlame.   CIA can be contacted via /u/Karmanaut.    /u/Bipolarbear0 is the representative of the Walmart Agency.   




 I'm sorry, but shilling for a gaming company only gets you a T-shirt.    The hats are only for employees of intelligence services.    And our space lizard overlords.   




 For the record, I was [cast as Tyrion Lannister](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/24w9xh/nsapril_revolution_leader_uhonestduanes_shadowban/chbahp0?context=3) and I'm not giving that part up.    They can be Cersei, but she isn't really a member of House Lannister anymore, since she married Robert.  They're the weird people who sleep with their siblings.  
 




 Who would want to control such a place?   I have better things to do with my time.   Like root out spam infestations.   




 Let's get these things straight.   I work for Mossad.   /u/Agentlame is an NSA wunderkind.    

As if either of us would stoop to work for the crappy CIA.   Do we look like /u/Karmanaut?  




 All down votes for me are currently counting as up votes.  Thanks the counter measures built into Reddit.   So, thank you for your unwitting support.  




 Oh, I am sure the admins are on it.   As it is right now now...... all votes for me, regardless of their being up or down votes, currently count as up votes.  The more they down vote me, the more comment-karma I earn.  

It's kind of funny to watch.   




 We asked him to remove his Bird Mask.  After repeated requests we discovered the horrible truth: It's not a mask.   




 But, you're an evil /r/History moderator.  You would think that.    Oy vey.  




 I love /u/Agentlame too.   That guy is great.   He makes the best brownies for the /r/Food mod team pot luck breakfasts.   




 This is a useless discussion to have in that subreddit.   These are people who think everything is slavery and rape except for actual slavery and rape.   Which they are sure aren't all that bad really.  

Which means logical communication with them is inherently impossible.   




 That is a good idea.   I will look into maintaining a list. 




 I've added it to several subreddits I mod.  I was an early adopter of it.  It's a very decent tool.  




 Slaves do not get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars each year.   That's why Universal Health care is not slavery.     Slaves are not highly paid.    




 Probably just burning sulfur.  Nothing to worry about.  




 Thank you.  Added those to the list.   




 In /r/Cancer we see a lot of  phony "I'm sick, I need money" spam submissions.  To the point that we were forced to ban fund raising entirely.   99% of them are really spammers or scammers.     




 The subreddits I mod do a lot of that.     It's a good way to limit the impact of the spammers.   But they still need to be reported to /r/spam.    




 When you have a young subreddit, you have to submit a lot of content yourself.    Also mention is **when appropriate** in comments in other subreddits.    

* Advertise it via places like /r/newsubreddits and via a nicely worded one-time self-posts in related subreddits.   One-time means one-time.   If you do more than that, the mods of those subreddits may take offense and the users may start to think you are just being a jerk/spammer.   
* You can also politely ask other mod-teams to list you on their sidebar.  But sometimes they will say no.   Be gracious when they decline your request.  If they think your a jerk, then they may block you entirely. 
* Ask some users who you see submitting similar content elsewhere to also submit to your subreddit.   If you like them a lot, maybe ask them to be a mod.  

And continue to submit content to it. This is the most important thing.   The more stuff you submit, the more people may take notice of it.   If there is no new content, then even if somebody discovers it months later, they won't come back again.    




 Let's cut this on to the chase.

Question: Does believing the earth is 6000 years old make you "an idiot"?     

Answer:  Yes, it does.   




 You know Hitler and Elvis share a second floor walk up in Cleveland.  But they had to evict Jim Morrison for not paying his share of the rent.   




 So far reddit moderators are still going undetected by society-at-large.    The plan is working.    




 For our purposes it is the same picture.   Removed! 




 Yes, it is.  This repeat submission has been removed.  




 The Duggar family, even without all the weird religion and stuff, is still just weird.  To be honest, revelations like this about a family of 19 kids.... not a huge surprise.   These are very weird people.  

Throw in the very, very Mormon beliefs, the TV show, the extreme right wing politics, and it all was bound to spin out of control into something very bad.     I don't know if it could have been prevented with all that crazy spinning all around.

 Thing is, there are a lot of wackos out there selling *cures* for cancer.    It's a common get-rich scheme a lot of very unethical salesmen engage in.   This includes a lot of spammers on the internet too.    

People with cancer are easy targets because they think "if it works, it's worth it".   A lot of people with cancer and other terminal diseases, they're desperate, so a good number throw money at these scam artists.   I wish people would stop preying on cancer patients.

 The opening of the Wikipedia article on [the Holocaust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust) addresses this issue with this sentence.  

Some historians use a definition of the Holocaust that includes the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to approximately eleven million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany and German-occupied territories.  

 




 Einstein wrote some essays about the Nazis rise to power.   I guess in the late 1920s there were groups that would give series of talks about how Einstein was an evil Jewish scientist who was working to destroy German Science.   Einstein got interested a bit and went to a few of these talks and sat in the back and listen to their crazy rants.   From what I recall, he said they never recognized him.    





































































 I didn't bother to carry on a discussion with him or any of the others.   I had better things to do with my time.   I had to work my way through a whole list of people who needing banning from the internet that day.     


































 Well, my their definition, anyone to the left of Hermann Gring is an out of control communist.    




 Agreed.     




 I was able to find [this one](http://i.imgur.com/FNkGCM6.png), which is a bit tame.    I think when the admins shadow ban people, their messages often get removed.   Or maybe it's the report button that does that.  If you report a submission in a subreddit, it auto-hides.  So, the same may happen with PMs, but PMs don't appear in your [hidden items](/u//me/hidden/).   

But if you were an average user and got a hate-PM like out of the blue, one might panic a little.  
 




 2+2 obviously isn't four.  It's a potato.  Only evil anti-Nazis think otherwise.   




 I'm sure /u/ani625 is correct about people trying to dox the spam-submitter.   So, that would be why they were going through there history and deleting old comments and submissions.  

There is like a big formal letter write up that is being PM'ed to people who the conspiracy lunatics don't like.    It gives you like 72 hours to admit you are wrong everything, and then delete or kill yourself, or they will come after you, your family,  your employer, your next store neighbor, your siblings, and the clerk at your local mini-mart.   It's stupid but looks like a terrorist threat.  

I've reported these idiots to the admins several times.   And they admins shadow ban them.   But if somebody just did a simple spam-report and then got that write up, especially if they do not have any experience with these lunatics, it might scare them.    So, deleting their user history could make sense to them. 

Myself, I just don't scare easily.   Not after years of sparing with these idiots.    









 Those people are very....    insane.  




 I'm steeling this write up from a great gentleman named /u/creesch.  

[Relevant xkcd](http://xkcd.com/1357/)

*I can't remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it's not literally illegal to express.*

---

Freedom of speech is a legal concept and a natural right of man that allows you to be free from persecution for espousing certain view points. 

The thing is though that freedom of speech and expression are not a absolutes. Even in the US there are laws that technically limit freedom of speech and expression:  Slander, libel, copyright, hate crimes, sedition and treachery for example.  

Then there are also other more basic rights that come before freedom of speech and expression and thereby limit them: the right to privacy, the right to have safety from violence, the right to fair trial. 

But that is all besides the point, reddit is a private company, so we venture into another area that a lot of people seem to misunderstand. On reddit free speech is often warped in this concept of "right to be listened to". While in reality the only thing it stand for is allowing you to be free from persecution for expressing certain viewpoints.

It does however not oblige other people to provide a platform for that speech. That is why schools can have and enforce rules against, for example, hate speech. So a school can discipline a student for distributing racial material but that same student can't be arrested by the government for distributing that same material.

 I would gladly pay the admins for their trouble.    $6.73 and an old 386 DX 40 motherboard to the admin who makes it happen.   




 It's even a rather simple and straight forward thing to get unshadow-banned.  All one has to do is say to the admins "I'm sorry, I won't do that again.  Please give me a second chance".   Sure, the admins probably won't give them a 17th chance, but 2nd and 3rd chances are not unusual for the admins to grant.  

The problem with most of the people babbling about conspiracies are that they never think they go too far.   Since calling the parents of school shootings victims and accusing them of being actors doesn't cross a line for them.... that just means breaking a few the rules of Reddit isn't going to cause them any moral qualms in the least.   




 It also sounds like the Christians who always talk about the non-existent war-on-Christmas.    Cause the holiday that controls something like ~half the American economy is in danger of being over shadowed by something else.   Probably the evil Sierra Club and Arbor-day.

 Admins can do whatever they want with regards to the site. If you don't like it, leave.

Hey, we're not going to get this wish.  They will never leave.  Instead they will just bitch and throw a fit for.... as long it's interesting to them.   As soon as a new cat video comes along, they'll watch that and not leave.   

Yes, they should leave.  For the love of all that is both holy and unholy they should leave.   But we're not going to get that lucky.

Just because one puts on a military uniform and plays marching band music doesn't mean your excuse for turning traitor makes sense.  Just makes you a stuck-up self-important idiot.   




 Another southerner who was loyal in the Civil War was Montgomery C. Meigs from Georgia.   He was the guy who decided to place the new National Cemetery on the Union Occupied estate that was then owned by Robert E. Lee.   The one we now consider the hollowed ground of Arlington National Cemetery.  

Meigs remained loyal to the Union and he was rightly pissed off that Robert E. Lee had turned traitor.   



















 As a Comp Sci project, it's sort of an interesting thing for them to do.   But if you want to user reddit, just using Reddit makes the most sense.  

Add in all the free-speech in all situations people who defend death threats and child porn.... and it's just a recipe for disaster.      







































 I listened to him on a interview of him on podcast once where he used the phrase "I'm as much of a feminist as a man can be as still retain a penis".     So he doesn't even try and run from the description.    He fully embraces it.   

People could only be surprised by his being very liberal because they are stupid.   Next up they will all write angry letters to the editor and blog posts demanding to know when water was made wet by the evil government.   
























 I have approved this AMA.   It was setup by /u/CaveDave for /u/NicholasVincent to do this.   I'll let Cavedave explain more.

 To the point that anyone who took up arms with the Confederates was required to re-swear Allegiance to the United States if they wanted to hold public office after the Civil War.   




 All the other reasons for the Civil War that you can come up with all lead back to Slavery.  

The Southern Agrarian Economy.... based on slavery.  

Tax issues.   Based on funds raised by working slaves on Southern Plantations.  

Trade issues.... around crops that were farmed by slave labor.  

States rights.... to own human beings as if they were farm animals.  

Not a one of those other issues does not lead directly back to slavery.    There is no other issue involved in the US Civil War.  It's 1all 100% of it about slavery.    Every other issue in relation to the causes of that war is actually the slavery issue in disguise.   




 They believed in so much freedom that the one freedom that was totally and forever to be banned by the Confederate Constitution was that Slavery could never be banned.  The one and only state right that they were totally fighting for was itself to be limited from the very beginning.   Slavery was to be a forever pact of the Southern States that seceded.    Advocating for change on that front was to be banned forever and ever.  Plus a few more years.  They considered slavery so important that they really drove it home in their treasonous rewrite of the Constitution.

 I model my moderation ways more on Tamerlane.   He supposedly dabbled in architecture, where he had towers built of human skulls.   You never hear cool stories like that about Hitler or Stalin.    




 Actually, the best domain to submit to /r/Politics is probably The Atlantic or The Nation.  And both of those are better quality.    Of course, YMMV.   




 The  "you're doing that to much" message never goes fully away.   It's controlled based on the karma one has earned in the specific subreddit.    If you go to a subreddit you have not posted in before and post things people down vote a lot, then you'll start seeing that message.   




 They are running from people like me.  You know, people who can't stand NeoNazis  and their stupid claims that the Holocaust never happened.     








































































































 It was never all that true.   The mythology about it is mostly something that admins let develop because countering it with reality would have involved doing something, like typing out a few comments.    Mostly the admins were very interested in something other than talking to users.   Which is mostly still the current modus operandi.   





















































































































































 IIRC, for about 5 minutes way back in the dawn times, it was the default way reddit worked briefly.   But it was killed by one of the First Ones and made optional cause lots of people were angered by it's existence.  Mainly cause it did weird things and took a long time to get used to when you did try and use it.   It seemed to be effected by a lot of weird things, such as different reddit preferences, browser settings, planetary alignments and whether you were into Star Trek or Star Wars.  And lord....  you don't want to know what happened to people who tried using it but were into Star Search.    They were flung into Stargate haven't been heard from since.

 I have had discussions with him in PM's about various things several times.   We compare notes on moderation and the like.  He really cares about /r/Science and does a lot of unseen work.   His article: [Reddits science forum banned climate deniers. Why dont all newspapers do the same?](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/) should be read by everyone.   









 I was talking to a feminist activist once who told me about how she got a bunch of complaining mens-rights guys coming to her blog where she was writing about how she worked to set up a woman's shelter.    She took a few of them at their word and decided to try and help them with setting him a men's shelter.    Instead of working with her they just called her names.   

A lot of those guys don't want to help men.  They just want to complain that sometimes woman are successful.   





























 I have no problem with your liking the prequels.    And to be honest, I probably would make peace with George if he would just refund my $10 cause of Jar-Jar.   




 From what I understand a lot of these kind of cases get appealed to the courts when the IRS tries to fine them.   









 I've  never really understood the whole "I don't like it so we must disallow it's entire existence" attitude a lot o people have. 

I don't like horror movies, but I don't advocate for a ban on them.  I don't like current Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon, but I have not petitioned the government to publicly execute him.   

Why can't people just be okay with things they don't like?   If you don't like Felicia Day, don't read articles she writes or watch videos she puts on the internet.  The Internet is a big place.  

For some reason, that just seems simple.   I guess it's not. 

Of course, I will still never forgive George Lucas for the prequels.   One still has to have some standards.    But something about the billions of dollars tells me that George probably doesn't care what I think.   :-) 









 A former slave responded to a letter from his ex-master after the Civil War.   [See here](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/01/to-my-old-master.html). 

The ex-master asked him to come back and work his farm.  The former slave responded with a request for 32 years back pay for himself, and 20 years of back pay for his wife.   And he also politely asked for a guarantee from the ex-master to not rape his daughters.   Figuring those were small things to ask for if the ex-master really wanted to just *let bygones be bygones*.   
 




 You can buy my silence with a Hershey's chocolate kiss.   




 /u/Nallen is basically the chief-of-staff mod at /r/Science and is one of the best mods across all of Reddit.   He knows how to weld the ban hammer and can more than hold his own with the best mods everywhere.     He's the one who setup the AMA with the guys from Monsanto.   From what I understand, it took months of e-mail exchanges with the company to get them to do it.    




 As with many things in life.....  Look around the debating table; if you can't immediately see who the asshole is, then youre it. 
 




 I suddenly have the urge to go to Olive Garden.  Those bread-sticks are amazing.  

 




 It does look a little similar to what happened in 2008 when the anyone-but-Hillary crowd all picked Obama early on and fought hard for him.     

The one big difference is that Obama was younger, good looking and telegenic.   Sanders, while not a lot older than Hillary Clinton (by six years), definitely appears older than she does.   Maybe that shouldn't matter in politics, but it does.  




 If the people truly disagree with the Courts decision, they can elect representatives to amend the Constitution.    What that entails is as follows

* 2/3rds of Congress starting the amendment process.   291 of 435 House votes and 67 of 100 Senate votes.
* 3/4ths (38 of 50) of the State legislature's to pass resolutions approving the amendment.  

Of course, on this issue.... those numbers aren't going to materialize.   Right now it would actually be much easier politically to amend the Constitution to 100% approve the Court's decision for all time rather then repeal it.   




 My sister ended up renting the whole conference room area at a major hotel for the wedding.  It included a weekends worth of rooms for the her and her now husband, the wedding party (ushers and brides maids) and both sets of parents.  About 10-12 rooms.  Included a stocked bar for the reception after the civil service they had performed.   All for cheaper than the church wanted for one day in mid-October in the North East.  

And it was at a Church she is an active member of too.   You would think that they would give a break for people who are really members of the Church.  

I'm sorry, but everything about it was crazy.   They got more space, more time, hotel rooms, didn't have to have a cash-bar, etc.   Way more than her own Church could have provided and it was cheaper.   I'm sorry, but that screams greed and nothing else.     









 *Being There* is one of my favorite movies.   I really recommend it.    




 Many people have been forgoing church weddings for a while now.  Often just to do with costs.  My sister is very religious, but when she found out how much her own church wanted to charge for the most basic wedding service, she went with a private civil service instead.   Churches can often be down right greedy when  comes to these things.   




 For a long time it was true.   But as with many things, Reagan didn't like the rule so he appointed judges who disagreed with the idea.   And then in 1994 Gingrich Revolution when the GOP won control of Congress.... the Senate largely only confirms judges who allow Churches a lot of latitude to lobby for candidates.   They get away with saying "We really like Congressman Smith" instead of "We endorse Congressman Smith".    And since they didn't say *endorse*,  they are allowed to all-but-endorse candidates.  

As long as they stop just short of saying "Vote for Congressman Smith", then it's not political.   At least according to a lot of judges out there.  So the IRS and other government agencies that might call them on the lobbying efforts have learned to ignore it except in the most egregious cases.   














 Chauncey Gardner, I presume.  
























 It's an age old  hobby of political groups.   Debating who's in the group and who's not in the group.   Then come the manifesto marathons where the subgroups all read each other out of the party.   And so you end up with the subgroups hating each other more than they dislike their actual political opposition.

 "If [the Civil War] wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about".  - Confederate General James Longstreet responding to a question as to the cause of the Civil War.  

Coupled with the [Declaration of Causes of Seceding States](http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~ras2777/amgov/secession.html) and things like the [Cornerstone Speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone_Speech) by  Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens.... the cause of the war was Slavery.   

All the ancillary other factors that people like to bring up, be it tax issues, tariffs, states rights, the Southern agrarian economy, etc.  Each of those other contributing factors contain slavery at the core of their being.  They can not be discussed in any logical way without directly discussing slavery.   Slavery can not be decoupled from the causes of the American Civil War any more than violence can be decoupled from war itself. 

This means the confederate flag (or the Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia if you prefer that name) is all about being a believer in slavery as if it was a good thing.  To say anything else is not just wrong, but willful and maliciously wrong.   









 If they refuse to leave for voat, can we lite up a pyre and enjoy a roast?   




 Where it the individual law that says you are a human with rights anyone is bound to respect?    Clearly if you want to claim you possess human rights you must be imagining new law into existence.   

Everything I just said is as crazy as what you just claimed.   




 I'm sorry, but the semantic content of interracial marriage question and the same-sex-couple marriage question are exactly the same.  They are the same question at the end of the day.  Both are 100% moral and ethical, and any other conclusion can only be based on a denial of human rights.   

Thomas and you may not want to accept this basic fact, but it does not change the basic fact that only way one can justify being against gay-marriage is to deny that gays possess inalienable human rights.   Anything else you might try and claim is bullshit lying on your part.  Your fully understanding that you are lying is not required.   You are just willfully lying to yourself as well.  




 The same bullshit arguments were made by people to oppose Loving v. Virginia.   They were willful idiots then, they are willful and malicious idiots now.   




 There is not one point in all of Scalia's dissent and his claim that same sex couples can't marry that wouldn't also once been made in relation to  interracial couples.   For hundreds and thousands of years that was banned.   But the court in 1967 found that thousands of years of bullshit around that was unconstitutional.  Same applies here.   The ban on same-sex couples getting married was illegal in 1789, the fact that the founders didn't know this just means they were **purposely** blind to their own laws.   They were wrong then, and Scalia is wrong now.   Period.  









 So, it wasn't left handled, non-religious, blue eyed, tall, polo shirt wearing Jews then.    Good to know nobody suspects me.

 It's not just NY City with these astronomical costs if you want to get a taxi medallion either.  I'm far from a libertarian.  But this is one industry where the government regulation has been used to keep competition out of the market place for decades now.  

If I want to take a taxi from my home into the metro-downtown area about 25 miles away, the price is over $100.   One way.    That's crazy expensive.    




 This time, why not the worst?   




 I assumed it was where you entered in a polygamous marriage but even then none of your husbands or wives want to sleep with you.   




 Yes, cause racist hate mongers should be provided a platform to spread their bullshit.     Really now.    




 The middle ground should be in making a self-post mod created thread and then removing all racist comments.   But then, people scream when that happens cause they aren't allowed to be racist shits.    Which is how you know they are only interested in propagating their racist hate.  




 Then why am I getting tons of PMs from /r/Europe users who lamenting that *the "kill all mudslimes" crowd is in full force and it's too depressing for me to wade through*.   Lots of people who are rightly disappointed that the mods there are now allowing racists to run roughshod over the subreddit now.  

It should be possible comment about what happened without calling for mass genocide of North African peoples.   Maybe some of them should try talking about it without direct appeals to hatred.    To call for indiscriminate murder of people who happen to be Muslim just because they are Muslim is to be no better than ISIS or other terrorists they claim to oppose.    




 Sherman wasn't the only one who thought the war was going to be long.  James Longstreet, when he was resigning his US Army post in Texas before joining the Confederate Army was asked how long he thought the coming war was going to last replied "At least three years, and if it holds out for five years you may begin to look for a dictator".  

Of course, he also said after the war when somebody asked him was the cause of the war war: "If it wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about".

 I was willing to fight to the bitter end.   But Sky asked me to leave the mod-list.   Not because he disagreed with me, but he wanted the idiots to stop screaming.    I told him giving into the idiots would just make matter worse, and that seems to have been the result.    That said, Sky is a friend of mine and I don't have to always agree with my friends.  




 Well, a small point of order.... but this god-person did promise in the bible that he wouldn't flood the entire world again.   Which is always why the bible thumpers have always confused me.   If the god-person was to flood the entire world again, he would be making himself a liar.    And asking him to make himself a liar.... doesn't that have to be very, very unholy and evil request for a bible believer?  

They are a perplexing people.   They want their god to be evil.   




 Especially if these people finally leave for Voat.   




 All gold is Jewish gold.    




 Thank you for making my point for me.    









 If I was made aware of that tread back then, I would have remove it.    I think the current mods should remove it now.   I will gladly pass that link along to them for removal.  
 









 No, what these people want to use the dead bodies of people who happen to be Europeans who visited Tunisia, a country that everyone agrees is not European, as props in their Hate campaign against Islam and Muslims.   They are using dead bodies like to propagate hatred.   




 This drama is started by the same people who wanted there to be zero mention of the Winter Olympics in Russia because (they believe) Russia isn't in Europe.     But now they are going to say Tunisia is.  

They're just angry *idiots* who like to get angry.    




 And the the New York Manumission Society, which got slavery banned in New York State..... it was disbanded decades after it successfully got slavery banned in NY State, three years before the publication of *Uncle Tom's Cabin*.    For the record, UTC was published in 1852.   NY State banned new slavery in 1799 and all remaining slaves were freed in 1827.   And the NYMS was disband in 1849.     

Oh, and in 1799 there were already fewer than 3000 slaves in NY state anyway.   So, it was a long time fading institution there already.  

The whole idea that people didn't know slavery was wrong until after 1852 is just incredibly stupid.   I get that maybe it was some kind of half-life date for popular opinion around 50%+ of the population finally seeing it as a moral and social evil.   But there had been people working against slavery for centuries at that point.   




 Within that is even a hint that States Rights was bullshit from the git go.  The Southern states in no way respected the Northern states rejection of slavery.   Part of the Southern demands when the war started involved the Northern states being required to make slavery 100% legal all the way to the Northern most tip of Minnesota.

 What we need to do is cross breed Mongols with Germans.   Then we'll produce the unstoppable killing machines. You know, Cylons.   




 Thing is, the tax issue is just the Slavery issue in disguise.   Because what is the tax on?    Goods that are created primarily via slave labor.  

All the alternative issues people try to bring up in relation to the Civil War are always, at the heart of the matter, the slavery issue at their core.  Take slavery away, and those alternate issues all evaporate away in a puff of smoke.  

Taxes... on goods produced by slave labor. 

Tariff issues, again.... on good produced by slave labor. 

States rights..... to own human beings as if they were farm animals. 

Straight up, there would have been no US Civil War if it wasn't for the problem of slavery.   Every issue that people bring up as possible alternate causes or contributing favors are themselves the slavery issue in disguise.   

It's one of those rare issues in history where the simple uncomplicated answer tells the full story.   Question: What's the cause the US Civil War?  Answer:  Slavery.    To give any other answer is to obfuscate the issue.

 /r/conspiracy is full of Nazis.   I know that.   Nearly the entire mod team there are wanna-be Nazis.   






















































 Isaac Newton, who was widely regarded as the best scientist ever....  he invented calculus, came up with Newtonian gravity and optics, etc.   You know what he spent a large amount of time doing?    He continually reread the bible while, get this, mapping Hell!    In the literal sense as if was a real place like London or Disney World.  

Individual Scientist often believe some strange shit.  What matters is what the Scientific Community on the whole espouses. And in the case of Climate Change, more than 97% believe it's real.    Of the remaining 3%, what you need to ask is how many are crazy outside their field of expertise and how many are paid to believe something else?     














 /u/nallen is one of the best mods of Reddit.   He knows how to swing the ban hammer when it comes to people who deny scientific facts.    If you deny climate change, evolution or the the germ theory of disease, the mods of /r/Science will jettison you from their subreddit.   They do it because facts are facts.  If you want to make up your own bullshit, then you don't get to play in their sandbox.   It's a great policy for them to have.   
























 And again, the admins took action.   But by default you want to assume everyone, probably including yourself, is secretly involved in a conspiracy.     And if you are confessing to something, then I think you should get to your confession.  




 You do a great job at /r/Help.  Thank you very much.   




 I heard he once killed and ate a jogger.    




 See, I don't think they are that well spoken.   And they are covered in drool.    




 It would be helpful if the admins read and responded to things in all the various mod and help-based subreddits.  Including /r/Help, /r/Modhelp, /r/Bugs, /r/ideasfortheadmins, /r/modclub, /r/Modtalk, /r/DefaultMods, and /r/ModSupport.   Plus any I am sure I missed.   




 For the record, SolInvictus was shadow banned by the admins for breaking the rules of Reddit.  He was removed for being a spammer.   It was clearly not a secret conspiracy or anything.  




 We should all just thank the Lords of Kobol that the admins used their deep fat frier on him.   




 Oy vey.  Really, anyone who wants to talk about the greatness of  voat, should just leave for that place.   




 Yes, there is a discrepancy.    Other than an abstract "what's the way it works", you aren't going to get much more. 

 




 From what I understand, same with vote manipulation and brigade detection as well.  














 In general, based on my personal observations, down votes don't count after about -15.   And there are cases where down votes count for positive comment karma as well.  The day I got more than -3000 down votes on one comment I net earned about 250 comment karma.  There were no corresponding comments that earned +3000 either.  

 












































 Ah yes, the various witch hunt threads that never even included half the real story.   You link to a bunch of stuff that is wrong about a whole bunch of things and you don't care about basic facts either.   For example, I didn't get kicked out at /r/Technology, [I quit and told the world why I quit](https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/23p696/meet_the_reddit_power_user_who_helped_bring_down/cgz8ecm?context=3)

As to /r/Europe.... [I said this](https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c0m0a/why_reurope_went_private/csrbiaw?context=3) a few days ago.   Mod leaks showing I was doing the right thing.   The same thing the remaining mods there are continuing to do currently.  Like that guy I am sure basic facts are outside your purview and I'm not going to waste any more of my time talking to you.   

I like how you see good supporters of you as people who uses usernames with K.K.K. in them.  [Look at what he mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoonTown/about/moderators).   Which tells the world everything they need to know about you and your so-called friends.  You don't know anything you are taking about.  If you said the sky was blue I would 100% know it wasn't.  




 I have to say, I'm very disappointed you joined a gang with Qgyh2.   We might need to evict you from the /r/History gang for that.  :-) 




 Come on, /u/Creesch.   It's obviously that the cabal is ruining the world.   Who is in the cabal?  I'm not exactly sure.     Nobody really ever seems to know what the secret cabal is up too.  From what I can gather I think it has something to do with controlling the coffee futures market.  














 There is a very simple way to make sure you never get reddit gold, even by accident.   Don't use Reddit.  If you have an account, you can always [delete](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/delete/) it.   




 I would take credit, but I was only doing what was right.    




 All Hail the one true DZNeill!   He died and then was risen for all Reddit sins remembered.     














 Dzneill singlehandedly ran the help-based subreddits for years.   Everything in /r/Help, /r/Modhelp, /r/ideasfortheadmins, etc. was answered by him.    He stopped doing it at one point because.... well, basically back in the day he never got attention from the admins when it was needed.      They just ignored all the good work he was doing for them.   I am still very disappointed in how they treated DZ back then.   









 I know and have modded with /u/solidwhetstone a bit.  And he isn't the type of person who flexes is e-peen a lot.    He may disagree with fellow mods a lot, but never in a non-productive way.   He has never appeared to be disingenuous to me.  

I would be surprised if he reverses himself on this issue.

They're hands were not clean.    




 Well, it's a [standard thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbsMZecRgbI) I am once again forced to link too. 

 




 I used to suggest that Reddit hire you.   You did a lot of great work for this site back in the day.   I still think they should.   But they aren't that smart.   




 Sorry, but no.   




 Most of the subreddits that went private are public again.  

/r/History, /r/Science, /r/IAMA, /r/AskReddit, /r/Gaming, /r/Art, etc. 

That said, you can check out the list of the subreddits you are subscribed to here:

* https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/mine/

You can remove subreddits that may be private from the list on that page.  



















 I removed a shit load of spam.   Things that still need to be removed for being spam.  I do that same thing now at /r/GetMotivated, /r/History, /r/Bestof, /r/Food, etc.   Spam is not a small problem and spam is still spam.    I had done more than 120K spam reports in my time on Reddit.   That's the second most of any mod ever on Reddit.   Only /u/Kylde has done more spam reports.   









 Considering I didn't remove the threads in question that you complained about before, that should tell you something right now.  But then, as I already pointed out.... you like to ignore actual facts.   In short, they are still being removed; you just choose to ignore it.  

Good day to you.    




 You're still cooler than she is.   




 Not true.   I was the mod who took /r/History private.   /u/Creesch later put it back online a few hours after /u/Nallen made /r/Science public again.   They were made public again because /u/kn0thing made threads in /r/Modtalk and /r/Defaultmods and seems to be addressing the issues.   Getting his direct attention was the goal.    

OF course, the fact that it took several hours to get the attention is still a bit whacked.  

People want to make crap up.   But then, they often like to do that because some people are just crazy.   




 I was removing racist bullshit from here.   Things I continue to remove from other subreddits I mod to this day.   Heck, the thread you guys complained because you thought I remove was **NOT even removed by me**.   It was removed by another mod of /r/Europe who is **still** a mod here.    But I stood by his removal and continue to stand by it.    Removal of that thread was the correct action.  It's still removed at this time.  The current mod team here continues to remove similar threads every day.   Not that you care really, because facts are actually unimportant to you.  

Racism and hate are a major problem on Reddit.  We know this because the Users of /r/Europe have said it was a problem. See these threads from /r/Europe on the storm front problem:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1w3fnr/seems_we_are_important_enough_for_stormfront_to/
* https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y0tbb/headsup_popular_neonazi_site_daily_stormer_is/

And it's a problem faced by all of Reddit.   For example, the definitive /r/History comment statement on the problem.  

* https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2puapu/alfred_hitchcocks_memory_of_the_camps_very_nsfw/cn0a25e?context=3

The history-based subreddits of /r/History, /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians, /r/BadHistory, etc. all ban users for racist and hate-filled opinions every day.  Be they racism, holocaust denial, NeoNazis, NeoConfederates, Pro-Slavery or simple history-fact denial.    World War Two happened, denying it will get you banned for that alone.   And no, the mod teams don't care if you agree with how we mod the subreddits.   If you don't like it, then you are free to unsubscribe at your earliest opportunity.  

Back to the issue of subreddits going private, /r/History was taken private after a long discussion among the mod team.  We were the fourth default subreddit to go private.  Only a few minutes after /r/Movies did so.   I was the one who made the setting change to take it private.   

We then made it available again after the Admins had made statements in various backroom mod-only subreddits.   /r/Science had already decided that it was time to come back, and we followed suit because the admins will giving the stated mod-issues the required attention.   

Others links that explain what was happening follow:

* [OutoftheLoop thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/)

* [Bestof Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/3bw7ms/top_mod_of_riama_explains_why_its_been_set_to/)

In short, mods doing their jobs are important for Reddit.   Mod tools have not been updated in several years.   Tools like /r/Toolbox which were created by people like /u/Creesch and /u/Agentlame are stop gap measures that they themselves have asked for the admins to copy their work for the benefit of all communities on Reddit.    

I could continue to go on here, but you won't read it and aren't really interested in what I am saying.  But somebody else might be interested in the actual facts, and so I post this answer for them.    
























 Several default subreddits have gone private at this time.   [This list](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bxjyu/list_of_subreddits_suddenly_going_private/) is being maintained by some people.  

So far /r/AskReddit, /r/IAMA, /r/science, /r/History, /r/Movies, /r/videos, /r/Art, /r/listentothis, and a few others have gone private.   Others links that explain what is happening are here:

 Just to make a bit of a public statement about /r/History.   

The mod team held a discussion and a super majority of the mod-team was in favor of going private in solidarity with /r/IAMA, /r/Science and the other subreddits.    We are hoping the admins get the message and that this is resolved in a way that we can all live with going forward.   




 There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . . 




 I've been around for a long time.   But there is the [Team Page](https://np.reddit.com/about/team/) that lists them all.  




 True dat.  




 /r/IAMA and /r/Science have both gone dark so far.   Both taken there by their mod-teams.  I am not sure what to do myself, but there isn't much else mods can do other than post a "were really upset by this decision" sticky that would get ignored.     Ignored so well that you wouldn't even know if the admins were aware of it or just not reading their PMs.   




 When you going to write your "When I was a Reddit admin" book?   




 /u/karmanaut knows that it's been set to private.   




 /u/ocrasorm is cool too.   




 I just tune those people out.   But yeah, that can be stupid.   




 The reason I have difficulty believing you here is that you have always had a problem in responding to people.  Mods often ask for input from Reddit, and rarely get it.   And this one is a problem that is going to be spread out across dozens of subreddits.   




 I didn't know he left /r/games or /r/gaming.    I"m sure it was because he thought he didn't have the time to mod them and wanted to let others have the sidebar display space.   Cause he's an upstanding person.   




 Please, let's not actually go crazy.   Bad decision is just a bad decision.     




 Well, there are a few others we like.   /u/deimorz and /u/krispykrackers are well liked.    But there are not a lot of admins that regularly talk to users.   




 Firing may be the wrong word here.   Laid off or let go may be a nicer way to describe it.   I wouldn't want to say she was fired, as that often carries the implication that the person deserved it.   And /u/chooter didn't deserve to be let go.   




 It wasn't a mod that was fired.  Reddit as a company let an admin  go:  /u/chooter  / Victoria.   She helped set up most of the highly visible AMA threads.   Not just at /r/IAMA but also at /r/Books, /r/Science, /r/Food, etc.   

She was a great admin.   

Edit:  /r/History has gone private in solidarity with /r/IAMA, /r/Science, /r/Movies and other subreddits now.  

Edit2:  /r/AskReddit, /r/Art, /r/Videos, /r/listentothis, and others as well.   




 Victoria setup several AMA's at /r/Food several times as well.  She was doing a lot of good work for Reddit.

 Invited.  




 Well, if anyone wants to volunteer, they should let me know.   














 Really, the place could use some moderators.   I would be willing to add some people to keep an eye on it and try and do something with it.   




 I was invited there at one point.   I just do mod mail there.   That said, the top-mod there doesn't do much.  I could add some mods there to keep an eye on things.   I could draft you and /u/Quouar if you wish.   




































































































































































 Well, this is new the definitive reddit-link/work on the subject.   

The only thing I would add is a quote from former Confederate General James Longstreet, responding to a question asking him what he thought the cause of the Civil War was: "If it wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about".  

But then, Neoconfederate apologists don't care about actual facts.   












































 I really wish the mods of /r/IAMA would shut crap like that down.  




 Correct.   Some images of Jesse Jackson with Dr. King [here](http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/01/76/11/516702/5/628x471.jpg) and [here](https://davidmandre.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/martin-luther-king_t3002.jpg). 




 That would be great.    I would love to see that happen.   Get rid of /r/Coontown, /r/GreatApes, /r/Holocaust, and other racist-hate filled scumreddits.   




 My sister, who is big into Facebook has never heard of Reddit.   Well, except from when I occasionally mention it while she is going on about how great Facebook is.  The vast majority of Americans just don't care.   That said, there is a semi-important marketing demographic some advertisers like.   Too many Redditors think that makes them important, when in reality it just makes them a target demographic to mine for money.   People still don't really care about them at all.   


































 You wouldn't have contradicted me if I had worked in a Battlestar Galactica reference.  :-) 




 Genocide Olympics:  The only winning move is not to play. 







































 Yeah, and I never posted why I quit /r/Technology or publicly took credit for it and revel in the fact that the automod rule set I created there is (1) still mostly used by /r/Technology right this second and (2) it spread to more than half the current default subreddits.  Oh, wait..... I did publicly post all that info and revel in taking credit for it.  

Considering I take credit for all this stuff, cause I like my badges of honor..... you're problem isn't that I did something bad.  It's that I did something good.  That others are seeing how my previous mod work was very good and are using it as the basis to stop you and your little nazi-wanna-be friends.  

You calling me pathetic is such fun.   Because it's truly meaningless coming from you.   [Goodnight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2dnfAJlUwo).   




 If your subreddit has to actually publicly post the "No Murder allowed" rule, you probably have a bit of quality control problem on your hands.   




 You are going to find this oddly fascinating.    Earlier tonight we had a user in mod mail explain that he was a Nazi, and not a NeoNazi.   As if there was some hair spiting difference I cared about in relation to that.  I guess the extremely violent (wanna-be, we hope) right wing cares about minor distinctions of that nature though.   




 And I'm sure it's a big coincidence that the hate-mongers who aren't regularly users of /r/Documentaries all found their way to that thread all at the same time too.   That isn't suspicious at all.   

Oy vey.   




 The mods of /r/Europe are still modding the same way.   Heck, they are probably now even stricter than I ever was.    But then, I think the mods of /r/Europe are doing a fine job.    




 The /r/European user-base is all Stormfront wanna-bes and related idiots.   A good number of them took issue with [my comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/ct5qt8e?context=3) when Spez did his AMA.  All while they were unwittingly [Proving my point](https://np.reddit.com/r/european/duplicates/3d4tnh/infamous_power_mod_utrain_subject8652_linked_to/) with their every objection.  




 The mods are removing stuff there because those people are trying to turn their subreddit into /r/conspiracy, complete with a lot of Antisemitic comments and other crud.   The mods are doing a good job cleaning it up with locking the comment-thread.  

Meanwhile, users from other subreddits are witch hunting the mod team there.   [Undelete](https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/3dsi69/massive_censorship_happening_within/), [Conspiracy-1](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dskoq/the_mysterious_case_of_deleted/), [Conspiracy-2](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dsq68/uss_liberty_documentary_reaches_front_page_with/), [Conspiracy-3](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dsmjd/watch_live_as_all_the_comments_on_a_rdocumentary/), [Conspiracy-4](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dt2kb/israeli_murders_rdocumentariescomments3dqwsathe/), etc.  

Calling them complete lunatics would be putting it lightly.   



















 Are you sure Fox News isn't in the service of Mephistopheles?

 We got a note from a user and I looked at this and removed it now.  

In then future, when you have a concern that something that might not be an appropriate submission, please message the mod team and we'll look at it as soon as we see the mod mail. 

Thank you.

 If we are lucky, the press will force him to change his mind.   




 I did ready my comment ahead of time.  But it was based on four or five comments I had written over the last couple of weeks.   I just edited them all into one comment.  Mostly because I knew there would be tons of comments in the thread.   And now after about an hour it's gotten over 8500 comments.   It's on it's way to 40K or 50K+ comments in there probably. 

I assume several other people did the same thing.   




 The comment was at about +120 then they linked to it.   I'm sure they will be by to tell us how they aren't a brigade at all.  




 Don't bullshit me.    The *ethics in journalism* line is total fucking bullshit of the highest order.   It's a lie you guy's KNOW is a lie but say it anyway.   That subreddit lacks all ethics.  

What is /r/KotakuInAction about:

See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3d2hv31/kn0thing_says_he_was_responsible_for_the_change/ct1qs7n) by /u/str1cken.  It will tell you want that subreddit is about.    I'll cut and paste the comment here.  

 gt;I haven't seen any personally "nasty stuff" about Pao

 gt;Nothing based upon her Gender or Ethnicity/Race.

Hey there!

I was curious about this myself, so I did a little bit of research.

Right now 16 of the top 20 posts *of all time* in KiA are about Ellen Pao directly (the post includes her name in the title) or indirectly (either about policies she has made or holding her responsible for things happening on reddit).

Weird, right? This sub is 10 months old but 80% of the top-upvoted posts in the subreddit are about Ellen Pao. Huh.

I know, I know : It's actually about ethics in games journalism.

Here are some choice net-positive-vote-total comments from just the top 5 Pao-related posts on KiA:

"[Arrogant bitch defines Ellen Pao quite well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3c2e68/ellen_pao_to_nyt_the_most_virulent_detractors_on/csrq9ha)" [+222]

So let's put that one to bed : Plenty of KiA users have said and upvoted "nasty stuff" about /u/ekjp and there's definitely more than "nothing based upon her Gender or Ethnicity/Race." 




 The best run subreddit communities are the ones that have mod-teams that enforce the rules and don't allow any hate-speech and other bullshit.  

For example, /r/Science does not allow bullshit opinions that aren't scientifically valid.    Either as submissions or comments.    So, they will ban you for creationism, anti-vaccine BS and [climate change denial](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/) as these are all views that are backed by all the world scientific community.    In short, they want everyone to know that /r/Science is scientifically accurate.  The same goes for other science based communties on Reddit such as /r/AskScience and /r/Biology.  

Likewise, /r/History and other history-based subredits like /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians and /r/BadHistory don't allow history-denial.   So, things like Holocaust denial, Lost Cause of the Confederacy propaganda,  Ancient Aliens crap, Neo Nazis, White Supremacy and other total bullshit views will get you banned.  

There is a large problem with hate-based groups that are trying to *colonize* (their word) Reddit in their attempt to spread their views.  Hate based groups like: White Supremacists, Neo Nazis, Skinheads, Holocaust Deniers, Extreme Misogynists, Homophobes, Racists who view all Muslims as terrorists, Extreme Racists, etc.   It's a large number of groups, and there is a massive amount of overlap between these subgroups.  

These radical nuts run subreddits like: /r/CoonTown, r/GreatApes, /r/European,  /r/Holocaust (holocaust deniers), /r/TheRedPill, /r/KotakuInAction, etc. 

Right now, [/r/CoonTown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits.  That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.  

If they don't take care of it, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.  

Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more [media outlets](http://gawker.com/so-long-reddit-1717315112) will start pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.    

Another point that largely gets  ignored in this debate:  Non-racists generally don't want to hang out with racists.   Racist and hate-group users generally strive to drive out the non-racist users.    

Everybody has a story about the racist family member that they only see once a year at some family gathering,  and we all dread running into that family member.   We really don't want to hang out, even for a short amount of time, with that person.   Well, when it comes to family we make sacrifices, so we (1) try and only talk about the weather or sports with them and (2) are very thankful it's for only one-hour a year.     But when it comes to non-family, you don't make the same allowances.    We just cut those people out of our lives.   

Bad users will drive out good users.  And then more bad users will be attracted to this site.  And it will become a bad-user reinforcement-cycle with more and more bad users driving out, they hope, all the good users.    These groups even know this, and count on the non-racists leaving.  It's why they use terms like *Colonizing*, as they are actively attempted to take the entire site over.  That is their goal.   They are not interested in undirected discussion with anyone.  They want to control the narrative and how any discussion happens.  They are actively trying to turn young people who aren't already racist bigots into more racist bigots.     If you allow them to run wild, 90% of the good users will leave.  And what's left will simply be a Storm Front members wet dream.    

Paul Graham mentions this issue with bad users in [this essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html).

Other web sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google+ have taken to dealing with racist hate groups. It's high time that Reddit did the same. 

I also want to address the BS that some limits on free speech are inherently bad.   Because the only country that really thinks free speech means "Anything Goes, including extreme bigotry" is the United States.     But other nations, such as Germany, France, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Italy, etc.  place some limits on "Free Speech" via bans on things like Holocaust denial.    Now..... I'm sorry, but you can't tell me Germany or Canada is any less free than the United States.    The reason the Germans don't allow open-Nazis into the political debate in their country is that they tried it once.   It ended badly. 

In short, you don't allow these people a foot hold because their goal is to make Reddit into a hate-propaganda site.   Hopefully the admins are finally going to do something about these groups.   It's high time the admins took action.

 FPH was never a top-20 subreddit.  It had about 150K subscribers.   That would, rounding up a bit to assume it had nearly 160K, had made it the 220th largest subreddit.

 /u/Blackstar9000, good to hear from you again.  And good to hear that you generally agree with me.  I didn't see this thread until just now.   Next time maybe shoot me a PM please.  

I see most of the other points I would have made in response to you already made by some others in this thread, so I won't bother repeating them.   

But I do want to reiterate one point that I think was large ignored.   Non-racists generally don't want to hang out with racists.   Racist users generally drive out non-racist users.    

Everybody has a story about the racist family member that they only see once a year at some family gathering,  and we all dread running into that family member.   We really don't want to hang out, even for a short amount of time, with that person.   Well, when it comes to family we make sacrifices, so we (1) talk try and only about the weather or sports with them and (2) are very thankful it's for only one-hour a year.     But when it comes to non-family, you don't make the same allowances.    We just cut those people out of our lives.   

Bad users will drive out good users.  And then more bad users will be attracted to this site.    These groups even know this, and count on non-racists leaving.  It's why they use terms like *Colonizing* when it comes to what they are trying to do.  

They want to take over.   They are not interested in undirected discussion with anyone.  They want to control the narrative and how any discussion happens.  They are actively trying to turn young people who aren't already racist bigots into racist bigots.      If you allow them to run wild, 90% of the good users will leave.  And what's left will simply be a Storm Front members wet dream.    

I want to address the BS that some limits on free speech are inherently bad.   Because the only country that really thinks free speech means "Anything Goes, including extreme bigotry" is the United States.     But other nations, such as Germany, France, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Italy, etc.  place some limits on "Free Speech" via bans on things like Holocaust denial.    Now..... I'm sorry, but you can't tell me Germany or Canada is any less free than the United States.    The reason the Germans don't allow open-Nazis into the political debate in their country is that they tried it once.   It ended badly. 

In short, you don't allow these people a foot hold because their goal is to eliminate people they disagree with.    




 It could have been harsher.  I could have invoked Turtle Power.   




 Is that the one guy created all those fake accounts?    I would have thought he would still be sleeping.

 Commie bastard.  :-) 


































 Excuse me, but "open and honest discussion" never includes calls for mass genocide.    And anyone who thinks it would doesn't understand what any of those words mean.  Period.    




 Except that the best run subreddit communities are the ones that have mod-teams that enforce the rules and don't allow any hate-speech and other bullshit.  

For example, /r/Science does not allow bullshit opinions that aren't scientifically valid.    Either as submissions or comments.    So, they will ban you for creationism, anti-vaccine and [climate change denial](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/) as these are all views that are backed by all the world scientific community.    In short, they want everyone to know that /r/Science is scientifically accurate.    

The same goes for other science based communties on Reddit such as /r/AskScience and /r/Biology.  

Likewise, /r/History and other history-based subredits like /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians and /r/BadHistory don't allow history-denial.   So, things like Holocaust denial, Lost Cause of the Confederacy propaganda,  Ancient Aliens crap, Neo Nazis, White Supremacy and other total bullshit views will get you banned.  

There is a large problem with hate-based groups that are trying to *colonize* (their word) Reddit in the attempt to spread their views.  Hate based groups like: White Supremacists, Neo Nazis, Skinheads, Holocaust Deniers, Extreme Misogynists, Racists who view all Muslims as terrorists, Extreme Racists, etc.   It's a large number of groups, and there is a massive amount of overlap between these subgroups.  

These radical nuts run subreddits like /r/Holocaust (holocaust denial), /r/CoonTown, r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/TheRedPill, /r/KotakuInAction, etc. 

Right now, [/r/CoonTown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits on the site.  That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.  

If they don't take care of it soon, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.  

Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more [media outlets](http://gawker.com/so-long-reddit-1717315112) will start pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.    

/u/Spez's post here gives me hope that, at long last,  the admins are finally going to do something about these groups.   It's high time the admins took action.  




 Okay.  




 Yes, and it's a poorly managed bizzaro land at that.   

Daeres is a very good moderator.  He's not some kind of crazy guy who sends in 5000 tanks to crush the bones of his enemies beneath them, like georgy_k_zhukov.   He's more interested in utilizing highly controlled air power to bomb out a city center and then secretly poisoning the local water supply.   And that is when he releases the genetically modified killer hamsters with lasers on their heads into the ecosystem.    

From a mod perspective, it's never a simple banning.  It really can be a thing of pure beauty. 







































 I would see anti-brigading measures as something important to moderators.    I'm pretty sure that I am not the only one.    I am not sure if it's priority #1, but it's certainly important.  




 [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/23p696/meet_the_reddit_power_user_who_helped_bring_down/cgzbvef?context=3).  Good night, Alice.  




 I'm sorry, but equating /r/Atheism with people calling for mass genocide of X-ethnic group.  

Holocaust deniers are not part of any "bastion of intellectualism".  

You are purposely being colossally intellectual dishonest and undeserving of any more response.

Full stop.   









 /r/Technology was removed as a default by the admins after I resigned in a very public way from the mod team.   It was the lack of actions by the mods who refused to improve the subreddit that caused the admins to remove it as a default subreddit.   [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/23p696/meet_the_reddit_power_user_who_helped_bring_down/cgz8ecm?context=3) for info on what happened. 

As to the Automod config that I helped author at /r/Technology, it has ended up being used at more than half the current default subreddits.   You act like that is some kind of shame for me, but get this: **I'm proud of that fact**. It was and still is a great configuration. Heck, /r/Technology is still using the majority of it right this second. 

The other mods there with me, /u/Agentlame, /u/Skuld, TheSkyNet, etc. all of us resigned in protest at the inactivity of our then fellow moderators.   Fellow mods who refused to discuss anything at all about how the subreddit should function.    Of course, we were of the opinion that a subreddit called /r/Technology should actually be focused on technology, not ancillary topics like business, marketing, politics or simple news.    Stock price fluctuations are not about technology.   A simple car fire is not a r/Technology story.    News stories have a large subreddit called /r/News that exists for them.   And political stories have a large subreddit called /r/Politics for them. 

My degrees are in computer science.  Software and hardware are technology.   Stock price is not.   An article about how a new type of electric car works is technology, where as an article about the current stock price of the electric car company is not.    

Heck, the haters figured out we were doing the right thing after we resigned.  That was why lots of people demanded the resignation of the old do-nothing mods and many of the new mods after we left.  

 




 Web sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google+ have taken to dealing with racist hate groups.   It's time for Reddit to do the same.  

When a site allows racists to run wild, good users will leave because they will not wish to associate with racists.   In effect, bad users will drive out the good users.  Those users who leave are replaced by more bad users who are attracted by the permissive attitude.   By allowing racists free reign, they will proliferate and become an even larger problem.   

Paul Graham mentions this issue with bad users in [this essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html). 




 There are many things were there are NOT two sides to the issue.   There is just the correct view, and the wrong view.    For example, evolution does not have two sides to the debate.  Instead what you have people who believe in science and complete and utter morons.  The anti-science idiots have no right to their opinion.   Period.  

This is true of several issues.   Evolution is is real.   Climate Change is real.  The Holocaust happened.  The US Civil War was about Slavery.   Anti-vaccine hysteria is bullshit.     

/r/Science does not allow comments from people who don't believe in evolution, spread anti-vaccine propaganda, or deny climate science.   The same goes for other science based subreddits such as /r/askscience and /r/Biology.    

[An article](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/) written by /u/Nallen on why /r/Science does not allow Climate Change deniers. 

Likewise, /r/History and it's fellow history-based subreddits such as /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians and /r/BadHistory do not allow Holocaut Denial, Ancient Aliens BS, Lost Cause of the Confederacy crap, Neo Nazi propaganda, and other forms of history denial. 

And I'm sorry, but these are not topics that the mod-teams of these subreddits are going to open up for debate.  Because there is no debate about them by anyone except hate-based groups who are knowingly pushing hate-based agendas.    If you do not like these mod-policies, then you are free to unsubscribe from our subreddits immediately.  




 [I'm familiar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackout2015/comments/3c8cdm/the_rmodtalk_clique_is_not_allowing_new_mods_to/cstaed0?context=3) with their partial brand of idiocy.   There are many of those types of subreddits.  I was not attempting to create an all-included-comprehensive list.  




 I have been very disappointed in the reddit community for a while now.   There were often submissions to backwater hate-based subreddits about Ellen Pao that had comment chains which were all comments about her sex and race.  This was well before the blow ups with the mods.  Nominally the news story submissions were about her law suit with her former employer, but they were all nothing more than excuses for idiots to gather round an make  sexist and racist comments.  

Subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/SubredditCancer, /r/Undelete, /r/KotakuInAction, /r/Redpill, /r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/GreatApes, etc. all made common-cause in the effort to say nasty stuff about Pao.  Then when the ruling about FPH was handed down, they made sure to invite all those hate-based users into their idiot-clubhouses.  

When the mods of the defaults acted, independent of of any of that crap, those idiots pored out of the word work again.    Mod teams wanted to make sure that our users and the press knew that we didn't care about Ellen Pao's lawsuit or be thought to be in common cause with a bunch of hate-based idiots.  At /r/History we threw together a [wiki-page to explain our reasons for going dark](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/timer).    

Now something that needs to be addressed very quickly are the various hate-based groups which are actively attempting to *colonize* (their word) parts of reddit.   Several hate based groups of white supremacist, neo nazis, holocaust deniers, etc. are setting up shop around Reddit.  
 
Right now, [/r/coontown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits on the site.  That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.  

As such, the admins need to directly address the proliferation of hate-groups on Reddit.  There are lots of subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/Holocaust and other subreddits that solely exist as propaganda outlets for pure hate.     If they don't take care of it soon, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.  

Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more media outlets will pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it. 

I've been saying this [since before](https://www.reddit.com/r/modtalk/comments/3c7pj1/rmodtalk_seems_like_a_very_levelheaded_community/cstg9jt?context=3) Ellen Pao resigned.   I'm saying it now.  I will continue to say it in the future.  
 









 I'm surprised this story doesn't claim he killed them all and was instead about whether he was legally entitled  to keep the dead bodies.   




 Do you think Trump could type more than 140 characters?   




 A simple alternative might be some kind of thread-trigger (similar to when a mod flags a thread as nsfw), that automatically causes a stanza that locks the thread to be added to the subreddits Automod config.   Then it could be a simple extension of how automod already functions.   But without the mod needing to know how to code it directly or edit Automod config.   




 Just going to leave [this here](https://xkcd.com/1357/).

 It's one thing to see a good and bad side to various issues, but there are some things are primarily one or the other.   And by vast orders of magnitude.   For example,  white supremacist hate groups are bad.   I think we can credibly say that without worrying about extraneous factors.   

The same goes for similar groups that espouse holocaust denial, proponents in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, Lost Cause of the Confederacy crazies, believers that all-Muslims are terrorists, etc.   One also finds that these other fringe groups all have more than a small amount of overlap with the white supremacist racist groups.   So much so that I think we can begin to speak of them as one large hate-feast.

 /u/Maxion and /u/dzneill used to be good at that too.   /u/Il_Shades, for about two weeks until Anu and Max drove him to quit cause he dared to think that the rues applied to everyone.     














 My second link explores our arguments with him about that.  /u/Rolmos and /u/Creesch are in that thread showing the screenshots of do-nothing Qgyh2 from the modlog.   




 The automod configuration wiki page from /r/Technology ended up being used by more than half the current defaults.   Right this minute.    You act like that is some kind of shame for me, but get this:   I'm proud of that fact.   It was and still is a great configuration.    Heck, /r/Technology is still using the VAST majority of it right now.    

Go sell crazy somebody place.  We aren't buying it here.   




 You saw who the applictions were from and HOW they were collected.   And you know I was not the one who was adding anyone as a moderator. /u/TheSkyNet, /u/Agentlame, /u/Skuld, etc. were the ones inviting the new moderators after they were voted on in the backroom.   But then, you just don't care what the facts were, then or now.   




 Except the fact that Qgyh2 wouldn't let /r/Technology recruit new mods to join the team, and when we decided that we had to do it because we desperately needed more hands to help run the subreddit..... well, that blew up big time.   [See here](https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/23p696/meet_the_reddit_power_user_who_helped_bring_down/cgz8ecm?context=3).  

Also, he's famous for doing nothing.  [See here](https://np.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1pkb2b/sorry_reddit/). 




 You sound like the kind of guy maybe I should try and recruit to mod /r/Food.   









 I didn't remove those for personal grudge.  I removed them because those idiots were using /r/Ideasfortheadmins for their personal grudges.   And I would remove it again today for the same reason.  

You want to believe BS, you can believe it all you want.  But it's still BS.

If people want message mod teams, there is a link of the sidebar of every subreddit that does just that.   It's very easy for them to use it.   But they always want to act like it's something only rocket scientists can figure out.   



















 He was fried.  Let him stay fried.   




 It's not just /r/AskHistorians, but a whole bunch of subreddits, from /r/History, /r/science, /r/askscience, /r/Biology, /r/BadHistory, /r/HistoryPorn,  and even none history or science topic subreddits.   Places like /r/Politics, /r/Bestof, /r/GetMotivated, /r/Apple, /r/AskReddit, /r/IAMA, /r/todayilearned, etc.  All have varying rule-sets they use for comments and submissions.   Some remove not much more than the rules of Reddit require, but all will remove a bit more than the admins require.   Even if it's just blatant mass-postings of profanity  (Things like the word "FUCK" repeated hundreds of times), to racism, trolling, etc.  

Mod teams get to define these rules.   If users don't like it, they can discuss it with the mods or use another subreddit.  There are thousands of subreddits out there.   But /r/History is never going to allow Holocaust denial.      And while Spez has now said the didn't mean to effect this, some undesirable users are going to point to his comment to play bullshit rules lawyer games.   




 Just going to cut and paste what I just posted in /r/Modtalk. 

---  

/r/History removes hundreds, if not thousands, of comments on a daily basis.  This is true for several subreddits.  We also ban people a lot for breaking our rules against history-denial.   Holocaust denial is just the #1 form of history-denial.   There are several other types.  

/r/AskHistorians is the same way.   Same with /r/HistoryPorn, /r/BadHistory and several other subreddits.  

/r/Science bans science-denial, be it climate change denial, creationists, anti vaxxers, etc.   Same with lots of other science-based subreddits. 

The mods of these subreddits use all the tools at our disposal to deal with these idiots.  Regular bans, Automod-bans, automod rule sets for both comments and submissions, and we even have more specific bots that enforce rules where automod can't.   And we still have a lot of mod-work that needs to be done to keep our subreddits properly clean and curated. 

If /u/Spez thinks moderators are going to have to tolerate these assholes ruining our subreddits, and their agenda-pushing political bullshit, then he should just cut to the quick and resign as CEO right now.  

---

I will say that Spez is now trying to engage with moderators, but it's just beginning.   









 One thing that I think the admins are going to need to directly address is the proliferation of hate-groups on Reddit.  There are lots of subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/GreatApes, /r/Holocaust and others there exist solely to spread hate.   

Right now, [/r/coontown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).

If they don't take care of it soon, reddit will have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.  

This info was brought to my attention by /u/PraiseBeToScience in another discussion.   I didn't know the problem was that extreme already.  

Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit. Or any other corporation for that matter.   This is something that they need to address.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully the media pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.  









 What was it - more than Four years ago?   This place exploded into a bunch of shit.   I'm still not exactly sure what happened then and I was there for it.

 The Confederate Constitution forbade states from ever amending their constitution from interfering with the institution of slavery.  The Confederate Constitution made slavery a forever pact that could never be removed.   They loved states rights so much that at the beginning of their attempt-a-country they limited the power of states rights.  

I'm sorry, but there were no other real issues involved in the American Civil War.  All the other ancillary issues are the slavery question in disguise.    


 




 The reason Lincoln eventually became anti-Slavery late in the war is that he realize it was the root cause of the Civil War.    The country couldn't exist with it and not fight Civil Wars.  If you ban it, then you get rid of the root problem of the war.   

The Confederacies own leaders said they were fighting the war for slavery.   The Cornerstone Speech by Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens explains point black the the Southern States were attempting to found a new nation based on ""upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition".  

So Lincoln decided that to win the war for real, Slavery had to be eliminated.   After the war, the former Southern leaders took to rewriting their own history to say that they were fighting for other things.   Normally bringing up States Rights, but also talking about the Southern Agrarian Economy, Tax issues, Tariff policies,  etc.   But each of those alternate explanations for the war are all really just the slavery question in disguise.  

Southern Economy was based on slavery. 

Tax issues, around profits made from goods produced by slavery. 

Tariffs on products again produced by slavery. 

States rights, to own people as farm animals.  

Slavery is the core issue the war was about.    Every other issue involved in the war was, at it's heart, also the slavery issue.  

After the war, Confederate General James Longstreet was asked what the Civil War was fought over.  His response was simple:  "If it wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about".   He knew what his war was about.  Saying it was about anything else is outright lying.  

Frederick Douglass became one of the people who helped turn Lincoln into the *Great Emancipator* after his death.    Douglass understood that Lincoln had figured out that the root cause of the war was slavery and that he then fought to destroy the very institution that caused the war.   




 Sadly, they think laws against murder are also being required to do something. Well, not do something, but laws against murder clearly limit their liberty to murder people.   And once you have placed limits on murder, then it's just a slippery slope to real crimes, like lying to an insurance agent.
