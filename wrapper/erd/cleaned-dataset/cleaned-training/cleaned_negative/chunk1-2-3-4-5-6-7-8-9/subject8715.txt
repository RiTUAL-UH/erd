 White Heat! 




 Everyone hates on it. But you know what? It's motherfucking Turbo Time, so fuck em. 




 "Where am I? Am I still in prison?" "You're in the hospital." "Ta-da..." 




 Jingle All the Way. "That was really a bomb? This is a sick world we're living in with sick people!" 




 Anne and her rules. No walks, no trips to the groomers. In the end, I just snapped. I screamed at her, Anne! Im dying here! It's like we never leave the house! Thank God, these well-dressed German men heard my barking and broke into the attic. Those brave heroes rescued me.

 




 That is a very odd scene that could be read in a variety of ways. Either way, it seems too ambiguous to be definitive. But I do think you can make a pretty strong case for Nick's bisexuality throughout the book. I'll have to keep that in mind when I re-read Gatsby. 




 That's an interesting interpretation, but why do you believe it to be definite? 
























 I posted this last night, but it was so late that I didn't really get a response.

10 Team 1pt PPR
Trade Away: Percy Harvin
Receive: Alshon, Reggie Bush

I'm just wary of Harvin's durability and I like Alshon better long-term. 




 10 Team 1 pt PPR

His Alshon for my Harvin

I know Alshon isn't playing well right now, but I feel better about him long term. Thoughts? 




 WR 2 is definitely my big weakness, but no one is biting on a trade. Just have to ride it out I guess.

Thanks! 




 10 team 1pt PPR

QB: Stafford
WR: Megatron, Sanders, Benjamin, Gordon
RB: Ball, Gio, Pierce, Doug Martin, Knile, Khiry
TE: Gronk

 




 10 team 1pt PPR

QB: Stafford
WR: Megatron, Sanders, Benjamin, Gordon
RB: Ball, Gio, Pierce, Doug Martin, Sankey
TE: Gronk

WR and the flex are definitely a problem for me. I left a few players off here because I'm working the waiver wire tomorrow.
 




 10 Team PPR
I have two flex spots to figure out this week. Candidates are Doug Martin, Bernard Pierce, Kelvin Benjamin, and Greg Jennings.

Pierce had a solid week, but obviously the other three did not... 




 It's a Wonderful Life. It's a beautiful movie and it is one of the few "classic" movies that nearly everyone will watch and love because of its charm. 
























 My friends and I wore the hell out of that pause button for the "upskirt" scene. It's amazing what the teenage brain thinks it sees. 




 He's officially out now with a concussion. 




 That's what I assumed, but I wanted some reassurance. Good thing I made him throw Bush into the deal as well. 




 Who won this trade?

Alshon/Reggie Bush for Percy Harvin

Thanks! 




 Depends on Charles' injury. If he plays, take a risk on Khiry. If Charles isn't playing then you have to go with Knile. 




 I doubt Charles will play, but just keep monitoring the situation. If he plays, I would go with Smith. 




 1pt PPR
Emmanuel Sanders or Reggie Bush?

The Sanders matchup worries me... 
























 This might get buried, but I wanted to share my Christmas tradition with you guys now that it's officially the Christmas season. Since high school, my friends and I have done this crazy marathon. We buy a shit-ton of terrible food, laugh, and enjoy all the best that Christmas has to offer. Even though my friends live in different states now, they're flying in for this crazy ritual.

I've seen a lot of posts about marathons/traditions here, but I have never seen anything as crazy as this. So, hopefully you guys appreciate this and feel free to ask questions!

Here's our schedule: [CMM Schedule](http://i.imgur.com/q0wZ8ou.jpg)

 I mentioned it in another thread somewhere, but I'm rolling with Gordwalk Hemphigher. 




 14! 




 We decided that whoever wins the loser's bracket gets 1st pick. The champion is last pick and everyone else is random. It keeps the consolation players involved and it's more fun that way. 




 Would I have named my team Gordwalk Hemphigher for someone so basic? Give me a break, son. 




 I always read The Great Gatsby around the beginning of summer. I don't know, it just feels right. Plus I feel like I learn something new from it every time. 
























 It's hard to tell, but from my what I've seen from Manning this season, I just highly doubt he has another season in him. But the question is, who are you grabbing at QB towards the end of the 1st round that has the potential to be a franchise QB? 




 There's actually a documentary about him that's pretty interesting. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1352717/

"John Cazale was in only five films - The Godfather, The Conversation, The Godfather, Part Two, Dog Day Afternoon, and The Deer Hunter - each was nominated for Best Picture. Yet today most people don't even know his name. I KNEW IT WAS YOU is a fresh tour through movies that defined a generation."

Edit: Wow, I didn't expect my simple post to blow up that much. Also, thanks for the gold! 




 Crash Bandicoot is the Mario of Sony for me. I miss that guy. 




 See, I read this as "Yes...if Peyton Manning is still here." Do you think DT wants to spend the prime of his career with Osweiler/whoever else we come up with? I think it sounds nice, but I would guess we need to pay up if Peyton retires after this season. 




 Well, that's certainly better than a 24 hour marathon of just Deer Hunter. 




 Thanks! It's normally two of my friends, one is my high school best friend and he's 23. The other one is a friend who started doing this with us a few years back and he's 28. Other friends come in and out for certain movies, mainly Die Hard. 




 Absolutely. I think it's thankfully gained a lot of kitsch value over the years, probably from people my age who grew up with it. 
























 Hell yeah. For the uninitiated: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Be7Xryos4 




 Look to the right of the alarm clock. Classic 90s film subliminal message. Timestamp 55:13. 









 Check to the right of the alarm clock. Timestamp 55:13 in Beethoven. Classic. 









 Well, life moves pretty fast... 




 Not really. There are two top tier QB prospects in Mariota and Winston who are likely to go 1 and 2 overall. Those teams won't trade. All of the other QBs are going, at best, top of the 2nd round and below. Guys like Grayson and Hundley are available around then. I doubt either are all that special. 
























 Dibbs on the Broncos... 




 Oh yeah, I loved 2K5. It was an amazing game. Obviously Madden 15 has its problems, but it is definitely the best Madden game in years. I guess take that for what it's worth.
 




 Madden 15 is a big step up, at least for me, on the PS4. Madden 25's defensive AI was terrible and I hated every second of it. 




 I'm in and I'd like to put in my vote for fantasy draft. Makes it far more interesting. 




 He said that, but a chance to return to your old team with one of the most talented rosters in the NFL is a different ball game. 




 The fact that it happened so quickly leads me to believe it has to be Kubiak as the #1 choice. I would guess they didn't want him to make a decision before they had a chance to offer. 




 My favorite was supposedly Walt's favorite. The transformation shot from Cinderella. Especially with the music

 Sounds awesome! Can you post that in the doc? I would, but I'm not sure of where you want the line breaks and that can obviously be a pretty important factor in poetry.

Here's the doc again: https://docs.google.com/document/d/109jlykx7_TnQwomYNdkBgx1bMZTunyA2ty7GmeSLbdc/edit?usp=sharing 




 Hello /r/books and r/poetry!
My group and I need help with a social experiment for our Poetry for the People class. We are trying to construct a poem with various users submitting 1-2 lines. We want you to feel free to express whatever poetic style you choose, so it can be a sonnet couplet style, free verse, heroic couple, weird stream of consciousness hormonal teen style, or whatever you think of when you think "poetry"

We're looking for anywhere from 25-50 lines to create a completed poem, so we could really use the help. And if you choose to write, please come back and explain your choices in this thread!

Our professor told us that no one had ever successfully completed a social media approach, so we would love to be the first and gloat. Also, my groupmates don't believe in the power of Reddit and I would love to prove them wrong as well. So please help me force some eating of crow and thank you in advance for your help!

 Oh yeah, I know. It's a good idea for sure. Just throwing my 2 cents in. Also fuck GroupMe. 




 I like the gift card thing. But I guess I just don't get the point of DaddyLeagues when all of those things can be done on the EA Madden page (as far as I know) and we can just twitch everything. 




 As someone with a pretty huge fear of death, I was mesmerized by this book. I was obviously horrified sometimes, what with the really stark and detailed description of the dying process. With that said, I absolutely agree that it is a must read book. Tolstoy's writing is obviously incredible, but the character does not at all reflect any sort of "carpe diem" mentality (at least from what I remember), which makes the book's themes even more appropriate.

Thanks for bringing this up because it often gets overlooked, understandably, amongst Tolstoy's other work. Also, it's a short novella, which makes it a pretty good starting point for Tolstoy's style if you're intimidated by the length of his other works. 




 Not the greatest movie, but the trailer for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was cut beautifully. Also, using Saint-Saens "Carnival of the Animals" was perfect. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAYtpZgelAM 
























 Let's change the rule that allows Cham in...

 Jimi Hendrix did the same thing

http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61926/book-hendrix-used-gay-ruse-to-avoid-vietnam

I also love the name "Gay Ruse" for a band now. 




 Thanks for that info! I've legitimately never heard of ECs before, but I'll definitely check them out and hopefully share with our class. 




 Yeah, unfortunately it was overrun by jackasses last night. 




 Emily Dickinson! 




 Well said and well written. Do your lines on Word normally turn into a "full length" poem, or do you turn them into something else?
