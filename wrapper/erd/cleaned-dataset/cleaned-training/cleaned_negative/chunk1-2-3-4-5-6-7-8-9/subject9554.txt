 Isaiah 45:7: I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things

Exodus 32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people

Judges 9:23 Then God sent an evil spirit

Jeremiah 45:5 behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD:

Jeremiah 49:37 I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:

Micah 1:12 . evil came down from the LORD

Micah 2:3 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil

Exodus 22:29-30 You shall not delay to offer from the fullness of your harvest and from the outflow of your presses. The first-born of your sons you shall give to me. You shall do likewise with your oxen and with your sheep: seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day you shall give it to me.

Ezekiel 20:25-26 Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not have life; and I defiled them through their very gifts in making them offer by fire all their first-born, that I might horrify them; I did it that they might know that I am the LORD.

 No, the real name isn't a requirement, or an issue. You have no clue what you are talking about. The issue is it deletes your avatar, subscriptions, and allows spammers to spam mercilessly. 




 Videos that were live streamed dont have the new commenting system, yet. 




 I am not the only one with this issue. I have heard complaints from many people on YouTube. 




 1. Links are now enabled to be posted on comments. Yes, you have been able to post links by changing symbols etc. however, those links were harder to use, and less people used them. Now, comments are a Stewart to spreading RATS.
2. Comments no longer have a character limit. Although you can now better voice your opinions, and bring out your argument in one comment instead of four, there is a lot more spam that comes with this system.
3. Top comments aren't relevant. The only way that top comments are deemed relevant to the video, is through google. Here is a good example: http://i.imgur.com/3YS2RmA.png
4. Google+ deleted subscriptions and profile picture(s). When you add an account, feel free to resub to all of your subscriptions,because "upgrading" deleted all those.
5. Google+ is an extra hassle to the simple commenting system we had In the past. Google has failed to address the flaws in the previous system, an ha created more weak points I. The recent update. 




 It doesn't work because it is worse than the old system. You have bots posting links now, and these links are-- I'm assuming viruses. The comments no longer have a character limit, which just brings a.whole new level to the spam.

All the replies aren't hooked together. Honestly, reddit has the best system for comments, communication wise. 




 Why would I be happy that someone is attempting to force me to do something I don't want to? 




 The new comment system is flawed and worse than before. Why the fuck is it a good idea to allow bots to spam virus links, why is it a good idea to allow unlimited character comments? The idiots that came up with this should be hurt. 




 What fucking clowns idea was it to allow links to be posted in comments? What moron decided unlimited character comments were ever a fucking good idea? 

The new update isn't helping communicate, because its a shirt way of displaying the comments, and it fails.

I don't even have to complain about google-. That's a whole nother pile of shit. 




 They are a nice way to communicate.

When you first login, you will be able to greet others etc. First you must get a place to live, there are apartments and hotels in the spawn town, or you can go into the wild and make your own house.







Drugs:

The secret word is lol. Admins are the FBI agents, they, and Police (mods) will work together to make drug busts. The current drugs are mushrooms, and sugarcanes. After you are caught with drugs, you will be sent to a probation officer every week. The probation officers are advanced Police officers, which manage all the players that have been caught with drugs.

Companies/Jobs

This is going to be long, as there is a lot to explain. When you join, you have the opportunity to look for an employer. More advanced employers have a prefix made for the company, and have the company prefix color. To have this, the employers must have donated $5 or more. The employers are your managers etc. They will pay you to do their companies job. Each company is a supplier, unless you are a store. If you are a store company, for ex. Walmart, you can make stores, and pay the supplying companies, money for their stock. When you pay the company, the employer pays his employees, this is what runs our server. You can chose from the following to make your company:

1.) Store

2.) Farming co.

3.) Mining co.

4.) Fishing co.

and any other resource gathering/selling companies. You can make blacksmiths etc, what ever jobs you find in real life you can make.








Towns:

Towns must have a theme, a town without a theme will not exist. Each theme has to be someone similar to the towns it is near. There should never be a medival town, near a futuristic town. Default towny stuff...

 Driverless cars are more dangerous that cars with drivers. These cars will not be able to react like humans can to certain events, and there will be traffic jams, and fatal accidents.

I highly doubt government officials will use self driving cars, just due to the risk, and it is much easier to shut someone up with a "computer malfunction" and get away with it. 

We are not yet ready for this technology, and it shouldn't be available to the public. 









 Execution baby! No need to waste more at payer money when te average middle class student cannot pay for college.

 God made every person, and he made us all flawed. No one has the authority to judge people who are straight/gay. I don't see why a lot of you care, it doesn't affect you whatsoever. 




 Our education system is a joke. No one cares about classes, they are all boring lectures of stupid where some prick refered to as a teacher, tells you to do shit.... We learn to complete tests, little of that knowledge is used in our careers.

Now I bet since we are so behind, they might give us more work which will lead to less giving a shit, and lower grades. 




 Unfortunately, unless we go about uhh, round 500x the speed of light, that shit ain't close.

 I am not here to start a war. I do not like to look at things from one side, so i am just going to ask you some questions, hopefully you won't take offense.

Let's start like this, I was raised as a Christian. We went to church every Sunday, I mindlessly prayed, went to Sunday school. I began to despise going to church. It was just boring, all that was discussed was the same concepts of love, respect.

I began to question the bible, gods, and their existence. I began to see a lot of contradictions, and when I asked my parents, they either changed the subject, or told me I should talk to the padtor.

I did just that, yet I still kept getting strange answers, that contradicted what was said by others in the past.

Out of curiosity, I read the bible, word by word. That too was full of contradictions, and passages that could be interpreted both ways.


Why have you started believing?

Have you read the bible word for word and seeked an unbiased meaning?

What are your personal opinions about athiests?

Do you think that it is right for God to send athiests to hell for eternity, because they didn't let him save them from him?

What are your opinions on heaven/hell? 




 I am confused. Why would age have anything to do with this? 
More importantly, why didn't she use the parachute?

 1. I believe what can be proved to me. There is evidence to prove existence for everything around us, but there hasn't been any evidence of a god. I can believe that there is a god, it is possible, but there is no evidene that suggests there is a god.
2. I believe there was a man who is refered to as Jesus.
3. The only problem I have with religion is that it is being used as a way to gain wealth, and religion has an impact on critical thinking. 




 Yup, praise The Lord for wrecking the car.... Fuckin morons.

 Sorry to hear that. It is sad when stuff like this happens. That is why I hate the brainwashing done by religious persons.

 They have a flag now? 




 Flash op 




 I despise the new system of continent locking, and fail to understand what the goal of this system is. I assumed the continent locking system would prevent unbalanced populations on continents, or bring players from indar onto Esamir and Amerish, however, I was truly disappointed.

The only continent I enjoy playing on is Esamir. The landscape isn't the greatest, however, that is the only continent that I can get good frames on, because PS2 is so poorly optimized, it makes Arma 2 look good. Now, after switching between 3 different characters, on 3 different servers, it just so happens that Esamir is locked on all of them.

What is the point of the continent locking system? Well, on the bright side, SOE statistics on performance will now show that the game is performing even better, because everyone who plays on Esamir because their PC cannot handle med-large battles on the other continents, due to the poor optimization, memory leaks, and so forth, will quit playing. 




 His head is huge, and empty...

 Looks like their offices are sausage fests... 




 If it takes so much skill, learn to aim to the point where It takes you 2-3 shot before you hit an ESF, and stop bitching.

Simply l2aim. 




 After they reach the peak of sales. 




 Flak is more dangerous than annoying my friend, if the gunner is smart. Now imagine flak and g2a lockons are everywhere.... Oh, and only 3 lockons kill you.... Food for thought?

All I see here is "br100's vetted stuff after playing for hundreds of hours, but i don't want to work for it" 




 Do you fly an ESF? 




 You hear about that street shooting the other day, kid shot himself in the foot in the middle of the street... 




 Air isn't the problem. The fact that your whole faction in the battle is waiting for someone else to play AA is the issue. If there are aircraft dominating a fight, repair an aa turret, pull a burster max, pull a sky guard, he'll even a lockon launcher will make them go away. 




 Unfortunately, some of them are ridiculously stupid. 




 Clearly SOE wants everything to be specialized, so why not allow us to refit our air Vic's?

It could cost like 25 aero resources for each weapon you change and what not. 

This would make it better for switching between a2a and a2g load outs. 




 I should have made it more clear that they went overboard on their nerfs on libs. I agree they need nerfs, but just amplifying their sound, and making them slower/less mauverable, and see how that would change things.

The reason people use rocket pods is: versatility. This is also the one thing game the game lacks.  




 Why does SOE constantly over-nerf? First, they needed rocket pods, so they didn't hurt infantry, now they are merging them against vehicles? 

First they said that rocket pods were meant to kill tanks, now yet are meant only AI?

So tell me SOE, what fked up stats are you basing these nerfs on? You clearly aren't takin into consideration that sky guard will destroy all air now, since libs and ESF won't stand a chance against them? When you use your statistics to make nerfs, do you take into account the amount of dodging that ESF's must do while fighting vehicles? Because the vehicles don't have to dodge, most of them can shoot back, and outdps the ESF's already.

Why don't you make small incremental nerfs, so you don't overdo it, and make the vehicle useless? 

 




 "As a BR 1 blah blah blah..." You didn't think this argument through. Irately, a BR 1 will have an uncerted air vehicle, making it hardly effective. Secondly, it requires skills that new players don't have.

You can easily take down enemy air with 20 mins of practice with any AA weapon, whereas it takes 30-50 hours of flying to be decent.

 




 Rocket pods don't need a nerf... It is hard enough to survive coming within 500m of an enemy sunderer with enemies that think "oh, look, air! Let's grab AA!"

Have you thought this through? I feel like this will do more damage to the air game, and the lib issues aren't being fixed: they can  turn around practically as fast as am ESF. It is ridiculously hard to fight a solo lib, considerig it is a bomber, it should need an ESF escort to survive enemy ESF attacks.

 




 Lol, I had the option to spawn at NC's WG 




 This has been pissing me off lately. I don't know whether this is a bug, or a stupid mechanic of the game. For some reason, the game decides to give me shitty spawns I don't care about, but areas being capped, with 0% our pop, don't give us spawns?

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=267590053
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=267589686

Quite frankly, doesn't help fights. 




 How much do you fly an ESF. If you have less that 30 hrs in the air, your opinions about thermal are invalid. 




 Can I borrow your enemies? Mine shoot back.... 




 Essentially coyotes? 




 Buffing AA 




 Libs are the problem. The current AA is really effective against ESF's, and buffing it would make ESF's unplayable. 




 Nerfs... Lots of em  




 Libs are the issue, not esf's. Esf and galaxies fit their role, while libs don't. With a decent pilot, libs are good for a2a and a2g, that isn't why they are around. Don't nerf ESF, libs need a nerf.

Edit: autocorrect fixes 




 Mattherson laggs quite a bit at times, this is even with a lower pop.  




 Wisest thing ever said. Some people don't understand that air can only dominate if it isn't attacked. 3 HA's with locking can kill an esf instantly. 

I play AA, and am a decent pilot, and you won't believe how many times we big out when we get locked on. Some pilots use flares though,not my thing. 

 




 When will AA get a nerf? Burster maxs and sky guard can destroy an esf in 2-3 seconds. When will soe make air game better? I feel like I am flying paper in the sky.

The amount of time and effort we put in to be decent pilots, is all countered by weapons, that require 1/100th of the skill to use.
Mattiace did a good job of explaining why there should be a balance for skill, not just weapons. http://youtu.be/F7AxfS3FHTQ

What are your opinions on AA as pilots, and what are your opinions on AA when playing the role of AA? 
























 Takes 3 zephyr hits to kill from full health w/o flak armor... So, you must be counting wrong  




 No! Everyone is perfectly fine with Nerfing weapons that aren't op, simply because a user, or several, have learned to use the weapon to its full potential.

Nerf the velocity of the rockets, and/or significantly decrease the damage. This weapon was here for the noobs, it should be a way for them to slightly increase their dps since their aim with nose gun will be bad.

- reduce cost to 250 certs 
- reduce damage significantly
- reduce velocity slightly 




 Try using a headset, they are louder then gals 




 I'd call hax, but ur in BLNG. That lib gameplay was beautiful. 




 Makes sense... Cause humans are animals 




 Server is up, you will have IP on Sunday when I'm back, and I can talk to you and explain some things. 




 I'm on vacation this week, but if you are interested, I am looking for some staff for a modern city rp server 




 I wonder when infantry side will realize that vehicles aren't op, you need to get good before they are effective. 




 Age? Experience?  




 What....a...fucking...idiot 




 Well, ever since that one terrorist event thy happened at those towers; I think a plane hit them or something. I'm sure you will know what I'm talking about, I can't seem to remember the date. Anyways, after the whole plane crash, security has become an upmost priority in the US 




 Last time I read this story, she disrupted class by shouting bless you.

Unless this information is wrong, this is why she got suspended. 




 Team viewer should work... Crappy fps though 




 The problem with g2a lockons is when you dive from flight ceiling after spotting a g2a enemy ESF. You engage in combat with that ESF, however, you have no friendly AA, and a HA locks onto you. Losing 1/3 of your health in mere seconds while in a dogfight is ridiculous. Unless you have great aim, and can quickly take out your target, and are dead.

There are situational exceptions, such as a valley to hide behind on Indar. And whatever else have you, but on continents like esamir, you are screwed. The chances of successfully running away from an ESF are slim.

It would be nice to have a "fix all." As everything has little versatility. In a place where there is an enemy ESF farming your faction, and it is a small fight an no one or one person is countering the ESF, it would be nice for aa lockons to do a bit more damage. 

 




 You obviously had some trouble thinking this through on a logical level. I understand if you hate logic, but we have to use it.

If the vehicle is at a stop, the repair rates are the same as getting out and repairing. The vehicle will still lose health, it will just save time getting in and out.

I truly hope your comment was a work of sarcasm, and not sheer stupidity. 









 If they remove termals, then they should remove any form of g2a, as it will be OP 




 Trucking was much better 1-2 decades ago. Gas prices have risen a lot, which has a huge impact on profit. 




 Darwin's theory of survival of the fitted has just been tested once more.

Feel sorry for the sister... 




 I wish this was my car... No cop would want to search my car; they would be too terrified that I would start preaching. 




 I don't follow... What has too little information? Wh-- I don't see your argument for this change... 




 Within last 2 months. I took a break from ESF s, and came back to libs. I noticed the change when vetting my vanguard  




 The base designs are the problem! Vehicles should be hard to kill, and you should be rewarded when you pull one, because they cost time, and resources. 




 I used then like a month ago and they were 350 




 Thermal optics were great for finding enemy vehicles on Hossin. At 350m, I though the range was short, but I deemed it a tradeoff, and accepted it. 

At this point however, at 180m, thermal optics are practically useless. Why don't you just fly low and find vehicles that way? Because I don't like AP rounds up my ass, thats why.... 

Why does the community feel like pushing SOE to nerf things that are in a good state?  




 Scrin had a valid point. Why should an invisible player be able to do damage to a vehicle? Make Max vehicle render range 300 then, or make infantry render at current vehicle render range... 




 I don't get why people bitch about stuff killing them... Maybe it is because I have 1000+hrs of Dayz?

If you get killed somewhere, more than once, by an HE tank, don't go there?? Get a vehicle and kill them??

Why is it that you have to shout "nerf" whenever you die? 




 Call out their position in region chat for other pilots.... 




 As long as they aren't over Ukraine, there isn't any serious danger... 




 Or... Destroy their nukes ;) 




 Why are these 'rebels' so dumb. Why would a Ukrainian military transport be flying 6 miles in the air, into Russia? Are the Ukrainians invading Moscow to take Russia now?

Fucking common sense  




 But there is a risk. When you have an ai weapon, you are going to get wrecked if you get attAcked by any ESF, or a tank. 




 Uhhhh... Lib OP! PLZ nerf higby!!!!
/s 

That aim was beautiful! 




 It's basically certain-death... 




 I have a better one: 5 reavers with tomcats..... 




 Clearly this is the result of piracy!

There we go haha. I was on my phone, so must've somehow copied the wrong link. 
























 You struggle with reading... but it's okay! This is the planetside  community, who gives a fuck? Spew stupid statements everywhere!!!! 




 Esf makes decision to run anti armor just like tanks can make the decision to run AA as secondary... 




 Skill is also a huge factor... banshee missed a bunch of shots ... 




 Thanks, the eggs and fruit sound interesting. Overnight oats.... I'll have to look that up haha.  




 Breakfast has been my main downfall in my diet. I wake up at 6am, and I don't have very much time, or motivation to make breakfast at that time, so I grab something quick like cookies and milk, or a toaster strudel. 

I don't like the food TBH, and I want to eat something healthier, but can't think of anything that won't take long and much effort to prepare. What do you eat for breakfast? 




 Could be even attempting to fight a pilot with 10x the hours while he is running any locks and you can rename your character to rekt 




 Do you have log files containing server crash logs? 




 You might as well not waste time making them unlockable.... Atleast if it will take THAT many kills... There aren't even 100,000 people playing this shit show. 




 Spigot will give you a performance boost, but it won't be something crazy. Using flatfiles is generally better than sql databases, and you get better performance with them.

Performance is hugely based on the way your plugins are coded. If you have anything custom coded by an inexperienced deceloper, that may be your biggest performance hit.
 




 Take some time to read through the stickied posts. They have a lot of information.

If you have any specific questions, please ask 




 Aod? They can kill in a 1v1? 




 Would love to 1v1 you some time :) 




 Well then... locking have failed miserably... coyotes for example are 1k certs, but obviously any new player can afford those...

New players don't learn shit from lockons, and when aces use them, we shit on every newbie pilot either way.

All lockons should simply be removed from the game. That's it... removed :O 
 




 Yup u are a brain dead moron. Unless you play on Briggs your shitty little PPA esf will get destroyed in seconds by any competent pilot, or you will get shut down by 1 flak source. 




 The lib was never buffed? Unless you call adding a few shitty weapons no one used anyways a buff... 




 I don't understand how the SOE dev team works.... When the majority of pilots complain about something being broken, like a2a missles, or coyotes, nothing happens, yet when a minority or majority of ignorant infantry complain about something like the banshee, it is immediately nerfed?

The air game has been shit forever.... The constant gank squads of 4-5 ESFs running lockons ruins the experience, not to mention the fact that AA can kill an ESF as fast as an assault rifle can kill infantry. Why are the real problems being ignored?

Its a problem on every server, and on every continent, yet appeasing infantry is more imporant than fixing 1/3 of the game. The pilots have been ignored, are being ignored, and will be ignored. 




 One competent burster max, sky guard, or aa turret is enough to scare off ESF's... 




 Since capitalism... 




 Referring to the tree in my pants?.... No....? No?....... Okay :( 




 I feel like this video explains my opinions:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ela3ChTzFcA 




 I don't think an icon is needed. We have a count of enemy forces on the map. Just add another counter for air, an one for tanks. That way players can see how much infantry, air, and ground vehicles there are 




 Why does it make sense that ESF's die faster than infantry in 24-48 fights? Why cannot pilots enjoy battles too? I understand that from an infantry point of view ESFs can be OP if there is only 1 person trying to counter 2-3 of them, but 1 burster max can easily scare away if not kill a solo ESF.

G2A locks only kill a2a pilots trying to kill ground farmers. Maybe I should try farming the ground instead of going for enemy ESF's? 




 I don't ruin good fights, unless you count saving my fellow ESF's. I only play A2A on my new char: rainnnfall. 




 I am talking about just coming NEAR a 48 person fight.... Anywhere within 100m 




 I started to write a nice little thread, pointing out the flaws and possible solutions to the problem with AA not just from the perspective of a pilot, but of an average infantry player, and I realize there is no point.

I challenge any game developer to pull an ESF, and attempt to engage anything within 1 hex of a 48+ fight. Oh, and maintain a KDR of at least 1 for 1 hr.  




 Unfortunately, flak is everywhere, and can shoot across a hex or 2. 




 It's designed to be a deterrent, but it's a killer for any ESF in a dogfight. 




 The seat number was his... 




 The devs don't fly..... Ever... 




 Oh that's weird... When I tap anything with my ESF it just explodes. 




 Fairly good quality video. I find it kind of ironic that infantry claims flak is UP, when you can get kills that fast. To be fair, those air vics were sort of beat up, but flak is very powerful, you just got to know how to use it. 




 Sorry, forgot to talk to you. Add me on skype: train_subject9554 and send me a message 




 It's as updated as I can get it. Then again, apple products are shit anyways. 




 These cars are going to be a disaster. Our GPS systems still take us on nice long trips in circles rather than get you to highways. 




 The problem is that you don't make progress as fast as you should for directives. 




 What if this bug will never get fixed because It forces ppl to use implants? 




 Since the release of directives this problem seems to have increased. The last person to do damage to a target should not get the kill. I propose that the player who did the most damage to the target gets the kill.

Why wasn't this the system in place since the beginning? 
























 You don't gain muscle without working out... it just doesn't work that way  




 It strictly depends on the calories that the bar has in relation to your diet.

If you are eating less calories than you are outputting you will lose weight. 




 DOMS are from doing something new your body isn't used to... 




 Lunges and squats don't work the same muscles in the same way. 




 1-2 pounds a week is the recommended... however if you are morbidly obese higher wouldn't hurt. 




 Your growth won't be stunted from lifting, more so the fact that you won't be lifting anything heavy for a while. 




 Thanks for this information. 




 Thanks for the information. 




 What impact will not doing cardio for a month have on my ability to do cardio? Is it like lifting where not doing it for a prolonged period of time will lead to loss of gainz? 




 So, did ya do it? 




 /r/fasting 

 




 Sounds interesting, I'll be keeping an eye on it, and might even post there once I have my diet at a level I deem acceptable  




 I'd you are using MFP to track your calories, I recommend not logging your exercise.

MFP is very inaccurate in calculating what you burned, so you may end up over eating as a result.

Any proof of him owning the machine? Proof it was disposed of by the new tenant?  




 Personally, I find myself playing legacy more than default. I find that legacy had better gameplay when it came to raiding, and overall just playing. 

Although the map isn't particularly as good, or as good looking, I still enjoy it because it has a special feel to it that I can't describe.

 If you struggle with reading, don't post your opinion, you look like a fool.  




 The gun wouldn't be likely to jam if it is in good condition, which it should be if you don't attack others with it...

This would discourage players from starting fights, and victims would be encouraged to attempt to retreat rather than go Rambo  




 I feel like people just look for things to be upset by. It was clearly a joke, and they weren't advocating selling puppies online.

 Your two team suggestion would make it worse.... whoever writes the code should be fixing the bugs in that code. That is the most logical and efficient way to do it. Otherwise the developer responsible for fixing the bugs has to figure out what the first dev wrote and why.

Games are harder to develop than you think. Yes it's extremely disappointing, but that's life.
 




 How about f2p servers, and subscription servers?  




 High killstreaks are highly situational at this point... I don't fly a2g as much as I used to 6monyhs back... but it's not easy to snag a kills or 2 before having to retreat. Besides... you play on Miller hahaha 




 Do you even fly? 




 Lol, what ground farm? Ground farm has been gone for months.... maybe an esf will get lucky and fins a 6v6 to farm until they realize that one person with flak can scare off/kill the esf....

People will bitch about esf being OP but for some odd reason they aren't flying them.... because they are UP.  
























 What a joke. Anything not in the US best interest is an act of terrorism. Ignore the covert ops like Bay of Pigs that the US has attempted.

 Ventilation walls. Would be built in place of other walls, and would allow for temperature "leak."

We all know how annoying it is to place a heater in every colonist's room. What this new wall type would do is allow for the heat of one heater to fill all the rooms that have a vent in between them. 




 Nothing.... you just waste 60 mins you could have spent playing a real game 




 Thanks 




 Majority. ... duh 




 Song? 




 Yup... I can agree with that. 




 IMO cut until you are happy with how you look, then bulk until around 15%BF and repeat. 




 No... no it shouldn't.... why would it ask the other team?  




 I think that just giving 10 mins to reconnect would be a life saver....

Computer takes 30 secs to boot up, steam takes 2 minutes to update and stop being a bitch, and the game takes a few seconds to launch.... 3 mins isn't enough time by a long shot. 









 I should have worded that differently. It changes the way that the college will react. 




 It isn't something you should count on.  Cops are paid for court time, so there is really no reason he wouldn't mind showing up. 




 The fact you will be selling them changes everything. IANAL but I am sure it's a copyright infringement. 




 Not entirely legal advice, but I would recommend purchasing a dashcam... would give you solid evidence you weren't in the wrong.
Edit:typos 




 Who's side are you on? Now when the government is making an attempt to stop them from screwing us ovee, we blame the government?  




 A crazy high population.... not exactly wealthy, and an anti meat religion.... yeah I can believe it. 




 It's a strategy and tactic for winning..... why are you complaining? Any player can do it, therefore it is fair... 




 You could drop it down to around .8g per pound. 




 You won't be overtraining. Don't even worry about overtraining tbh. 

As long as you are training different muscle groups each day, there shouldn't be an issue. 




 It's not an issue at all... People should have the right to chose to end their life of they wish to no longer live it.... 
 




 Look around on Craigslist. I'm sure new years resolutioners are selling them right about now.

 It means you are still eating enough to maintain your bodyweight even with your activity level.

Count calories for a week, you might be surprised with what you see. 




 Yeah ok...... ignorant as hell. 




 I tend to lose weight on cruises... I hardly eat much because there is so much to do and see. 




 Yes, let's just ignore everyone who goes to college, gets a degree for a career, and is fucked cause they can't get a jo b in that field.

 That actually happened... were many news articles about it not too long ago.
 




 Guys, it's a joke, not a dick. Stop taking it so hard. 




 Wait.... Beta is over? 




 ~~SOE~~ DB has decided to dramatically increase the price of many weapons, some of which gave the new players a competitive position against high(er) BRs. TB went from 100 to 875 certs (although the raise could be justified)-- basically, almost all vehicle weapons were raised to 875 certs.

What would be the reason for such an increase? Money -- don't waste your time spewing bullshit and claiming it isn't. This is where the Laffer Curve comes in. DB didn't raise the station cash (or whatever the name of the currency is now) price for the weapons because it would mean that less people would purchase them, they simply raised the price of the certs, in hopes that new players would either rage-quit, or spend money on the weapons.

Smed, I would be tossing $100 bills at this game if it was well optimized, bugs that players reported were fixed within a week, and the game was focused around **TEAM** play, not solo play.

 Still no pics? 




 Why did you bother posting this.... The article layer admits that it is only a password to a workstation and is useless unless you are in the building. It also doesn't actually control anything... 




 Capitalism 




 Keeping it is theft. Well, if you keep it but don't open it and give it back if hw comes looking for it, it is completely legal. Opening it, using it, selling it, etc is illegal because it is his property. 




 You made some good points. That is all. 




 When you are mocked for being fat, doesn't that make you wanna change it more? Actions have consequences, like I will prolly get downvoted by a bunch of butthurts. 




 It isn't the same. You won't have any modded servers wlth hundreds of random players to play with. 




 Thank you for the advice. To be quite honest, I am quite frustrated with the direction Minecraft is headed in at this point. 




 Minecraft desperately needs and update to cater to the needs of builders. Minecraft has ignored the wishes of the players who love building and creativity, and many have stopped playing because of this.

1.) All building blocks must have a half slab and stair version of them. This is not only a very quick and easy addition to the game, it will put the game in a much better state than where it is right now. Imagine how much potential hay half-slabs and stairs will add to the game! 
2.) Vertical "stairs" and "half slabs" must be implemented. This is a long overdue feature that will allow players to be much more creative and add much detail to what they build. 

These two and simple additions to the game would bring back thousands of players who enjoyed building, and played Minecraft because of building. Mojang has ignored the minority of builders and has catered to the childish PvP centered barbarian majority. Minecraft has a lot of potential, please let builders build.
