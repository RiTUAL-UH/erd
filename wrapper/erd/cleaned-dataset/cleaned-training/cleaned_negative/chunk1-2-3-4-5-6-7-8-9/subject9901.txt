 I decided to go with something a bit more [evil](http://imgur.com/6f21foR). It automatically closes the portal as soon as someone goes through. 




 I was trying to rig the portal with a BUD switch that would (hopefully) anger pigmen and they would attack whoever would go through the portal.  





























 There are pressure plates on the other side forcing them to spawn in the [string](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/2hzs4d/a_ridiculously_quick_nether_portal_trap_imagine/) that updates the piston. 




 People spawn in string that is next to the piston and then the portal automatically closes behind anyone who goes through it :}


Edit: Explain better 





























 There are tens of us, TENS!! 




 Nah, im just an ass hole who likes to build traps around my house. 




 ya, i need to work on my explanations lol. 
























 When people say "It's only a game." 




 I always release the ones i dont want, and i make a habit of only putting pokemon above lvl 25 into the system. 




 I know how you feel, I just got my first paycheck from my first job. The lack of ambition I have had for a couple years is finally gone and I can do things. Life is looking up for us both!!
