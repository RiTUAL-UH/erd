I tried demo and i love it, but i do not have enough money at the moment (and i am going to write an article on it when i get it). Sciency rockety stuff! I would be very grateful :) 




 I have a spare copy of this great game. Actually, it is my the most favorite game ever.
Post the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything and i will decide. 




 So, a few weeks earlier a guy stopped me near the place i go to school. It turned out the guy is a Hindu preacher, trying to sell some books about Krishna and talk people into religion.

I kinda like him, we talk for a moment every time i go that way, but he appears to be very brainwashed/clearly instructed. First, when i told him i am an atheist, he tried to tell me atheism is a religion (i told him it is in fact absence of faith). Today i told him i read The God Delusion and he went on how atheist don't know facts and write about it (i even told him Dawkins has all sourced), whereas religious books are true (particularly his own religion's one, obviously, because when i told him e.g. Bible and Quran are just books, that it is not an evidence of anything, he seemed to agree).

I am not sure if it's worth trying to learn him at least anything, I don't know if he listens. But I don't particularly like arguing with people, so i am not pushing anything.

 Hi everyone,

i do not expect to be many Czech people here, but i am going to post it anyway. With help from couple of other Czech bronies i managed to finish Czech Subtitles for the first part of [Brony Chronicles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2EOfhvvURY feature=player_embedded).

It was difficult, but i am proud of it. I do not expect it to be well-received here, but even if one person find it useful i will be happy.
BTW yes, i already posted it on Czech forums.

It it for 720p version downloaded off YouTube.

 When my cat lies somewhere, she put her legs and tail under her so she looks like a little furry blobby bean. It's adorable.

I just wanted to share with you. 




 Say it with a picture! 




 It's old, useless and powerless, i just want to be sure it won't shock me or something. 




 After five troublesome years i can finally rest from it and study English. 




 Here is a download link to the torrent, thanks to the loyal seeders it is quite fast.

 Can i set all except characters/objects/buildings on minimum and maintain good fps? What has the biggest impact on performance?

**DEEP WEB**, not the surface one
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Web 




 We've seen it in many movies and experienced in many games - enemy/alien threat is overpowering some major USA city, in the end the military/goverment decides to send a nuclear missile in there. Could that be a real scenario and under what circumstances? 












































 Psychonauts is an older game, yet it is my THE MOST favourite game ever and i will tell you a few reasons why:

* It's very different than any other games in terms of its originality
* Art style is fantastic even with limited texture resolution and limited amount of polygons
* The game is very humorous and funny
* Each level offers its own unique gameplay 
* Game setting is quite joyful and the plot is intriguing
* It has many things to collect, which serves not only for a sole purpose of being collected, but it's important for game progress.

Albeit it's an older game, the time hasn't taken anything from its enjoyability. If you pass off on it, you will miss one of the most original games ever created. 



















 I tried to Google, but i am not much smarter. 



















 I was going there, because some awesome things there were mistaken for uncool. Have we won?

 We got NMM, Discord, Chrysalis and Sombra. We all are excited by possibility of seeing some of them again, but every season so far introduced at least one new villain. Who do you think it will be in Season 4?

 Starswirl the Bearded was a powerful magician, who lived more than 1000 years ago. He invented spell to transform a pony (unicorn or pegasus) into an alicorn. The regal sisters used this spell to become alicorns and thus defeat Discord (and then Sombra). They kept the book for themselves and Celestia is testing her pupils (many generations of them). If they prove themselves to be worthy enough, Celestia reward them with turning them to alicorns. 












































 There is Derpy trying to open cookie jar with her hooves without succes, cursing "What kind of sadistic retard invented this crap?!. In the next panel is Celestia opening the cookie jar with her magic and she says something like "Hohoho". (i love her expression while she's doing so, that's why i am looking for it) 










































































 Today i found quite shocking (and somehow truthful) quote from Terry Deary: 
"I've no interest in schools. They have no relevance in the 21st century. They were a Victorian idea to get kids off the street. Who decided that putting 30 kids with only their age in common in a classroom with one teacher was the best way of educating? At my school there were 52 kids in the class and all I learned was how to pass the 11-plus. Testing is the death of education. Kids should leave school at 11 and go to work. Not down the mines or up chimneys, mind, but working with computers or something relevant. Everything I learned after 11 was a waste of time. Trigonometry, Boyle's law: it's never been of any use to me. They should have been teaching me the life skills I was going to need, such as building relationships, parenting and managing money. I didn't have a clue about any of these things at 18. Schools need to change."

 I enjoy fanfics, where ponies are getting drunk (no clopfics), i read a couple of 'em, but i want more.  




 Hi, a 7305 days ago, i was born here in Prague. Today I am 20, and i am no longer a "teen". Here's a few notes:

- i i am kind and friendly
- i am timid and shy
- i would want a family one day
- i am an atheist

Anyway, happy birthday to me! :)

 After playing a real obscene number of hours in Kerbal Space Program, I got into Simple Rockets pretty well, even landed on the Smoon and Smars - it is a bit easier thanks to being 2D - but I can't seem to be able to match velocity with rendezvoused-with ships. Docking was one of my favourite activities in KSP and I was quite good at it, but afaik there is nothing like relative velocity nullifying marker in SR. I managed to dock only once, and it was not very graceful, which is displeasing.
I don't know how to use that grey thing. 




 It was on Reddit some months ago, it was a project of a group of students of Spanish language. I need it quickl, thanks. 









 a) Every so often I experience a bug where the ship starts to rotate (using reaction wheels, it consumes power) by itself and only SAS keeps it in check and I can't get rid of it (not even by reloading). I suspect it has something to do with using physical/time warp or SAS toggling while rotating. Does anyone else experience this? How to get rid of it?

b) Is it possible to jettison an engine without having it set as an action group? 




 The beginning of the conversation is lost (it began at Omegle, it was basically that he is a Messianic Jew and he believes in the creation by Yahweh). This is copy paste of our email conversation (without names, emails and greetings); I would like to know what do you think of my reasoning, if I should improve something. Thanks.

 E.g. if I was dreaming about riding a rollercoaster which was about to smash into a wall, a cat jumping on me in the real world would project itself into the dream as the impact.

I don't think that the message needs to be spelled out. In this form it is quite obvious.

Aside from the message, it is extremely well done. 




 Hello!
I am quite fond of KSP, and this caught my eye as something I would surely enjoy (building bases/ships/...). It is on sale, however, I can't spend money on it this month. I would be very thankful to whoever would be so generous as to gift me,  and I make sure to pay it forward in the future. :)

 It was an issue we came upon today in school while discussing animal mistreatment. 









 This question occured me today - do the turning radars at KSP point at some specific point or trajectory in space? Is is possible that there are some undiscovered easter eggs? 







































 Fellow froods and froodesses!
Every Earth year on May the 25th, we hold a tradition of visibly carrying towels around with us, because on this date, there is a regular increase in flying saucers fly-bys, though we can't see them easily due to SEP field, and we have to be prepared for sudden untold adventures, Earth demolitions or serendipitious petunia materalizations.

In every case, this act also serves as a homage to Douglas Noel Adams, who ~~wrote~~ received from extraterrestrial beings this utterly extraordinary trilogy in five parts, and decided to share it with us.

Whatever happens this day, don't panic. Or every other day, for that matter...

Just reading this makes me sick. They use religion as an excuse to slaughter each another. It is surreal. 




 I am interested in reading Krauss's book Universe from Nothing, and I'd like to know if the recent discovery of gravity waves affect that hypothesis in any way, and how?

If this question makes no sense, I am sorry, I am no scientist. 


































 Ever since 0.23.5, I am often experiencing a weird time warp/gravity physics bug, where all parts of my vessel except the main part (capsule or whatever) go limp (as if in a freefall without horizontal speed), it becomes fixed (meaning it doesn't move and it is not affected by neither pressing keys or burning) and the trajectory changes rapidly even when not burning. When I try to time warp again it says that the time warp cannot be used under acceleration, or it disassembles rapidly. 

It happens in orbit around Kerbin. 




 I've seen a mod that adds giant asteroids (FSAA or something like that) as parts, but no mods that make them appear like vanilla asteroids. I understand that they would be virtually unmovable, but cool bases could be built on them. Is there any engine constraint preventing this? 














 I have passed both levels in practice tests, but I have a dilemma. I was almost bored when doing B2, but I am not very sure I can pass C1 again, though I did good in the practice test. 




 I run it on an old notebook (to process one chunk of data lasts several hours) and I don't know if I actually contribute to anything. And I heard some skepticims about whether one should run it. 

























































































 It seems to make the game a lot more realistic, if harder. Or there could be an option to toggle KSP/realistic gameplay.

What is the reason for not having incorporated it in the game yet? 









 Today I decided to play Ace of Spades Classic once again, so I go to a server and join the blue team. After changing several maps, one turns up where blue team is having its ass kicked really hard, when a message suddenly appear in the chat:

 We may not be winning in the game, but we are winning in our hearts.

Thank you, random stranger, for encouraging me a little.

 Come on sucker, lick my battery! 




 Do you think it had some connection to THE box or to Rainbow Power? Surely if she was studying somethingunrelated, they could just make her sitting and reading silently? 


































 She's an indoor cat, and we don't plan her to have kittens anyway, so we're going to get her spayed. I googled about it and what are the benefits, but I still feel bad about how drastic it seems and that she won't be able to reproduce. It is just sad :( 









 I sometimes go there to see what retarded things people say there, and it never fails me laugh. But it also enrages me a little, when I what turds can people spew of their mouths, and how ignorant some of them are - religion serves them as an excuse to not seek reason, to abandon critical thinking, to embarras themselves. Cattle do not see the stars and think they are special in the universe. In comparsion with immersity of the universe, we are uncomparably less than nothing.

I hope there won't be a shortage of people who publicly present reason, science, atheism etc. to people, because I have a grave feeling that it might actually be possible for the world to become a place where non-believers would be put ot death, if there would be no vocal opposition.

Just wanted to get this off my chest, carry on, or discuss it, if you wish. 














 I am watching Frozen right now (had heard that it is a nice progressive fairy tale) and it is well known that Disney movies work for majority of people, they can make people smile and cry at every age. Why exactly is that? 









 What if all those things with right arm are just a running joke to tease us, just like with the snail? Are there some solid pieces of evidence implying that he is really going to lsoe his arm?

I just watch the series, I haven't read comics or anything other yet. 














 [In the newest infostorm](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/265-Kerbal-Space-Program-Asteroid-Redirect-Mission-The-FAQ) there was this passage.

 **What is this Claw thing?**

The Advanced Grappling Device, or claw, is your primary means of capturing an asteroid. The Claw works very much like a docking port, however, it doesnt require a mate node to dock to. That means it can grab on to almost any object. Once grabbed on, you can even transfer fuel from the grabbed objects (provided they have any). 

Does this mean that regular docking ports become less useful? This wording implies that I can just launch a fuel tank tank with a probe on it into orbit and suck from it with this claw thingy. 














 I posted some shops to /r/photoshopbattles a few times, but I actually enjoy more cutting people/things out than think what witty should I do with it. 





























 A few weeks ago I have read an article about possible human colonies floating in Venusian atmoshere, and a question occured to me whether something like that would be possible to build in atmosphere of some Kerbol system planets?

I read on the wiki that lighter probes don't even need a parachute on Jool, so I don't think it would be completely impossible. What do you Kerbal rocket scientist think?

 I do it just as a hobby, don't get any money. 
























 Life would have been much easier.

**Edit:**

Utterly meaningless coincidence: 

Bartledanian books are 100 000 words long. According to the [Words to Pages](http://www.wordstopages.com/) converter, a book with 100 000 words written in Arial font size 12 with double spacing would have 365.3 pages. That is almost exactly the same number as number of days in a year. 









 Whoever posts best inspirational quote wins and I'll send them the key. 




 Just because it is so nice and quiet here 









 I get that you can carry 1000 books in a reader everywhere, but paper books are flexible, have "personality", last potentially a very long time and frankly, do you really need to read 15 books at a time? 




 No posts. I am not longer interested in it, so anyone else can take care of it. 


































 I know there is no point to it without mods beside satisfying feel, but i would like to ask you what do you think should be there, how big it should be and so on.

EDIT: Without mods of any kind

 I think we should get a bot which would after typing something like "BibleVerse: Part XX:XX" respond with corresponind verse from standard King James Bible.

Commenters on this sub often adress some verses, so this could be useful. I wonder whether this idea have been proposed before, if it was, i am sorry.

Same could be done for other holy books too.  




 It's because of authority of the person who said them? Or because the quotee formulated the idea so well that a quoter feel they don't need to add anything?

And why some people hate quotes so much?

 



















 I was on Minmus with Bill and Bob. On the top of a lander there was a rolling probe, so i rolled it about 1,5 km away, did some measurements and flew with Jeb to collect data (well, more slid than flew).

When i was a few tens of meters from it, i switched to probe to slightly angle it for convenience. When i wanted to switch back, there was no Jeb.

He disappeared.

I was confused at first and looked for him all over, but he simply vanished. I went to Astronaut Complex and he is listed as MIA.

What the hell?

BTW when i planted the flag i named it Jebediah's Vision after that creepypasta; coincidence much? 




 [SteamID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039)

It released yesterday, but i don't have any money. It is on sale now. I would be very grateful and make sure to pay it forward later. 




 I play on lowest setting due to my old PC, but i was thinking if i could afford to make my game a bit prettier without losing performance. 









 After almost 300 hours of playtime i found out how to rotate parts in 5 steps and how to clone. I feel stupid. I was thinking how people make Death Stars and bowling balls and lithobraking stuff and it never occured to me to google it.
If i did not watch some Manley's video i wouldn't know it... I thought i figured the game by myself. Well, i have a lot to learn yet.

Edit: And of course the rest of controls too, i forget to mention it. 




 I am browsing interwebs and what i don't see like announcement that the Octodad sequel finally came out! I am extremely happy, but i remember i ran out of my allowance for this month and will have to wait and buy it when it will be not on sale anymore.

So please, if someone could give it to me, i would be very grateful and make sure to pay it forward later.

 I am pleased. I love oatmeal. I think i am going to make myself a cup. 




 The question of money would be put aside, because people would realize the utmost importance of expanding into space, so all materials and workforce would be for "free" (people could even volunteer for working on some tasks like manufacturing parts, which would then be send to ~~World Space Center~~ Starfleet from all over the world; those who participate in programme would get all they need from governments) 


































 Note: I am a fan of 2005's Doctor Who. I am not planning on watching older series, i am quite content with the new.

I must say it is one of the best series i've seen. About a year ago i started to hear from my friends how good it is, they posted DW related things on Facebook and i am naturally quite open-minded, so i put it on my imaginary "To watch" list, but i did not rush in any way, actually, it was one of my new classmates who gave me needed push.

First episodes were feeling like it was a cheap TV production - it probably was, and i do not complain - and it got better with time. I love series which have consistent universe, and DW satisfied me in this way.

Not everyone may see it same, but i like how they put homosexuality in there every so often - i am not a homosexual or in LGBT community, but i am happy for those people, i support them (of course i like gay jokes and so on, but that is different). I also felt some atheist themes in the series, that was pleasant too. I also very like the Doctor's "no guns" policy, it's not something you can see very often today.

I sure am going to continue watching, though i call myself just a fan (don't really have urge to call myself whoovian yet; maybe this will be my backup fandom)

 There is always someone who hasn't seen something yet. 




 I flew to the Mun and collected high amount of scientific data, but i underestimated needed power to get back to Kerbin, and poor Kerbal must have EVAed (of course with data) and set himself on stable orbit. So i send first rescue - it was a probe with four solar panels, i don't know how, but i managed to position the way that no light could reach them, thus rendering probe dead. For my second try i attached two 1x6 automatic panels to it and i even managed to get rendezvous orbit - but in the wrong way! Now i am going for my third try. Wish me luck!

EDIT: Finally! That was insane, it took 4 tries before i managed to pick up poor Kerbal, and then i had to position vessel hanging on a parachute so he won't fall off his seat (another valuable lesson - always using capsules). 









 If i add an addon, will it render my vanilla profile save unusable in vanilla again, even if i don't use modded parts? 




 I have googled a bit, but i can't see nothing. 














 What is the point in rescuing Kerbals?

Have you ever collided with a piece of debris from your earlier launches?

Do you consider mods cheating? 




 I landed dozen or so manned modules on Mun, i learned to dock on orbit (i started to build a space station) and i got a few new upgrades.

 I have never been particularly good at multiplayer shooter games (and I don't play them often, so I am not very skilled), usually I was in the bottom half of the scoreboard, but I always enjoyed myself.

What are your feelings about it and about low-scoring players? BTW I am not looking for comfort, so please speak your honest opinion.

- Philae bounced twice and travelled some distance, but somehow managed to land again and it is stable, but it is rather unknown if it is on its side or upside down or what

- most instruments work, ESA getting science data

- all means of firmly attaching to the surface failed (that is bad for drilling, isn't it?)

- no panorama photos were released yet

Edit: Lol, it was actually three landings 


































 If something goes wrong and the lander bounces off despite the engine pushing it "down", will its mission be considered entirely unsuccesful? Do they have one shiot only or can they try to push it down again after bouncing off?

 I installed WD Black 1GB yesterday, but neither Windows nor Disk Management can see it. I plugged SATA data cable into the motherboard and I am powering it through [SATA-Molex adapter](https://i4.alza.cz/ImgW.ashx?fd=f3 cd=MK297a i=1.jpg) plugged into a cable that was until now powering only 2 fans. I checked the cables and they seem to be plugged well.

Edit:I forgot to add Troubleshooting tag, sorry.

EDIT2: Issue solved, thanks for help.

 It is on sale now, but I really don't have any money left, and it has been made available on Linux now. I'd be grateful if someone were so kind and gifted me (of course I'd pay it forward). :-)

[My Steam ID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039)

The base game would be enough.

EDIT: I just got it from one of my friends. 














 By idle I mean when they sit somewhere and stare at things. Do they asses dangers and look on their environment for changes or what? 




 If you put a small engine on the bottom of a rocket/tank with larger diameter than  that of said engine, then when you attach something to the engine from below it creates fairings, but those have only the engine's diameter.

It can be secured with struts, for sure, but it looks ugly as hell, and having to meddle with Procedural Fairing's interstage fairings is a bother.

Is there any mod which makes it right?

 I have 64-bit Ubuntu and tried to apply this patch, but it does nothing for solving the mk1podCockpit/model problem for me. :( 




 After X hours of building I am exhausted, so I am going to make it simple:

I have to plug the GPU and 2 fans (front and rear) into the PSU.

GPU has connector, which is split in two, each of them looks like this

 I o x x x I

Both fans also have dual connectors, but they are each different:

 I x x x x I

 I o o o o I

"x"s represent pins, "o"s are holes

The PSU is modular, and I have one cable which corresponds to GPU's and fans' connectors. 


From PSU end, it goes like this:

 I o o o o I

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 IooooI    (a small header connector)

How should I plug it all to the PSU? It doesn't seem doable. 














 I bought some new hardware and got a Radeon Silver Reward code. Since I am not in need of any new games at the moment, I decided to give it away here. You can get 2 games this way.

For my amusement, draw a squird (squirrel+bird) drinking Bailey's out of a shoe, the best/most humorous drawing wins the code (I'll PM it to the winner).

EDIT: It is over, /u/saad93 is the winner. 




 I am about to order all components for my first build and I was skimming through my picked parts when I noticed that PSU was 430 V and recommended voltage for GPU was 500 V.

So I searched for a bit and found a similar question here on BaPC where was said that recommended GPU voltages are for the whole system.

I also used a PSU calculator and it showed me that even less voltage is needed (400 V), so that confused me even more.

How do I make sense of it?

Link for picked parts:

http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2efx5f/build_ready_is_this_good/

If it turns out to be OK, this post might be regarded as Build Ready I guess. 




 I have decided on my first build, but today I remembered that people recommend to install OS on a SSD. The problem is that I do not have enough money at the moment to buy both at once, so I am torn if I should get a SSD first and add HDD later, or go for some SSHD.

I have to decide quick, since I am going to buy all components tommorrow, so if you could recommend me some drive, it would be great.

Here are the parts I have picked.

My budget is maybe 20 000 K (960.20 USD), this build without SSD would cost me 23 741 K (1139.81 USD).

I can add a new screen and SSD later, but it is going to suck until then (my current screen is a tiny 1024x768 one).

I would appreciate your help with rating this build and, if possible, recommending something cheaper. I didn't make this [Build Ready], because I am not entirely sure yet.

Thanks

What in the actual fuck... Really, this is an example of the perverted religious culture.

 






















































 I'd argue it is very hard growing up in Western culture and not know anything about religion. 




 I would have no problem with religion if people wouldn't believe it. 




 Of course there is a heat shield,I forgot to mention it. 




 Good idea, thanks 




 I am currently designing a lightweight escape pod for two Kerbals, basically seats on a cubic strut with a parachute with fairings (but I don't think they're necessary now). now I have to just solve the stabilization during activating small separating boosters, because it tends to spin instead of keep firing retrograde. 




 You did good. Some people created a dumbfuck religion out of it and try to make it last as long as possible - blame them for that we do not know yet what happens.

 As Cooper is falling in the black hole (or is it already *somewhere else*?) we can see he is falling towards [a spherical structure](http://i.imgur.com/vFciagz.jpg). Given his relative size to [the space of the tesseract](http://i.imgur.com/LD4OvfQ.jpg) and assuming a "chamber" in there is taken as a cubic space with every side being one clearly visible rectangle (or mabe rather the dimensions of Murph's room), I'd assume it could be estimated how many "chambers" there were, but I can't do the math. 




 "Probably a dozen times since their deaths I've heard my mother or father, in a conversational tone of voice, call my name. Of course they called to me often during my life with them  to do a chore, to remind me of a responsibility, to come to dinner, to engage in conversation, to hear about an event of the day. I still miss them so much that it doesn't seem at all strange that my brain will occasionally retrieve a lucid recollection of their voices."

Just thought it would be nice to point it out, since Google search turns out twisted versions of this quote. 









 For me it is a horrible/overly complex UI. That is the reason why I do not play many strategies/MMOs, I just want to have fun without having to learn what all buttons do and so on. But if I immediately think the game is worth it, of course I can sacrifice the time learning it. 




 One of my cats purrs very easily and so I can clearly hear changes in purring, and I noticed about 3 "levels" of purr she gives off depending on the amount of her satisfaction and contentment. The usual purr can then be accompanied by a "deeper" purr or even another sound.

It is mindboggling that it is not funded more. 




 Almost all of my EPL bases are on planets (and one is in orbit above Kerbin), but I haven't as of yet tried to make a functional base on an asteroid. I am not sure if it can be mined without additional plugins (and screw realism, infinite fuel asteroid deposit ftw). Can it? 





























 I have built a base on Duna, but I can't get the converter to convert. There is everything - drill, karbonite tanks, pipes and so on - but the damn thing is stubborn as Jeb. I have tried various pipe flows but it doesn't help. Isn't there a mod which makes it work automatically?

 I want to buy it, but I am not sure about this. 




 I saw some bottles of cider in Tesco and thought it would be nice to drink some again, so I bought a few, but it gave me 
tummy ache and a little bit of diarrhea and I was lying in bed all day. Is cider supposed to do that? Poor Applejack. 





























 I remember nothing else about it, but I saw it maybe 15 years ago 



















 Hi, just a quick question, in some games (currently Just Cause 2) VLC's global keybinding doesn't work. I like to listen to my music instead of in-game music and while it is just a matter of alt-tabbing for 2 secs to make it work and then going switching back to the game, it disrupts the experience. Does anyone know a solution? 
























 I mean, it is fun to have your rovers jumping, tubmling and exploding, but if you seriously need to get somewhere far it is a nightmare, as the rover easily slides. Is there a mod which improves that? 







































 Firstly, some of you may criticize me for this, but I mean no harm - I was browsing FB and look at some dude's profile and there was [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/Zp0JW6k.jpg) of him with his girlfriend. It made me happy for them.

Most people would consider them rather... not pretty, but they don't mind. They found each other, and you can really see their happiness. There is hope for every one of us. 












































 It has this adventurous feel, almost nostalgic. Why is it so obsure, I heard about this twice (the first time I forgot about it). 









 I just saw a ultrasound photo on my feed from my other cousin. 














 The other day I bought a carrot and when I turned a corner to a dark alleyway it hopped out of the bag, pushed me on the ground and brutally beat me up while laughing evily. 







































 In Pale Blue Dot Carl mentions his colleague who visited New Guinea highlands and found a tribe that was ignorant about technology but not about the Moon landing and the astronauts. I googled, but I can't seem to find what tribe it was. Can you help me? 
































































 As of now, shockwaves are only a visual effect and I think that's a pity. It wouldn't have to create a chain reaction, just disassemble things in proximity and push them away (or just push away if more distant). I kind of miss this feature. I googled but to no avail. 









 I built an EPL base on Minmus, but I cannot use it properly because there are two fuel ducts endpoints above the launchpad left over from positioning it and they clip with vessels and fuck shit up. Can't grab them and I doubt I can shatter/smash them with robotic arms. I set up a second launchpad, but I don't want to abandon this one.

[Look](http://i.imgur.com/MEQLMqd.jpg) 









 Upon "finishing" my 0.90 career mode, I started a new game with a couple of other mods, namely Karbonite, Extraplanetary Launchpads, and SCANSat so I try building fully self-sufficient bases elsewhere and explore the system more easily.

I have finally understood how those work, but I am having problems setting the SCANSat big map to the resources mode. It just still displays altitude map. I have sent a probe with both Magnetometer and SAR detector in a polar orbit of Minmus (I don't know whether SCANSat detector is enough). Do I have to activate the magnetometer? It didn't show the option before activating the detector, but activating the detector keeps my energy drained at 0.01, so I have no way to check, because it won't let me.

 There was a scheduled whatnot with the central heating in our building, he was one of the workers that came here. I did not expect that at all, I was in a bad mood and it made me very happy to see him. I love meeting my old friends. :')

 Hi, I just want to say that people often confuse me for you, and that the similarity of our nicknames is purely incidental. :-) 




 No, I am not him. I was asked a couple of times before though. I have identified with this nickname since primary school. Copypaste of my username's origin :

It has nothing to do with fun. It has to do with panting. "Funt" means to pant in Czech and when I was little and used to go to school with my sister I would pant because she was bigger and older than me and I had problems to catch up with her. Idk exactly when it happened, but she called me "funk" a couple of times, I think, and I made a nickname out of it later. It is not easily translatable, but I think "the little one who pants" could be fitting.

Btw it's uncanny, though, we both live in Europe and I am just a few months older than he is.

Ok you got a point with this one. 




 I'll pass, real laser tag is better. 




 Didn't you know? The /r/gaming is all about nostalgia. 




 You are admitting to being a part of the problem - you want the button to last as long as possible, and we all want to know what happens when it runs out. You are despicable.

What if the button is in pain and it screams PRESS because it eases its pain? 




 I wouldn't change my flair for anything. 




 The button clearly says "BUTTON PRESS BUTTON PRESS IT BUTTON THE BUTTON PRESS IT PRESS THE BUTTON BUTTON BUTTON PRESS IT THE BUTTON THE BUTTON PRESS BUTTON IT PRESS IT THE BUTTON PRESS IT NOW", so you are clearly commiting a heresy against the button by waiting. Pressing the button should be your duty since the button commands you so.

 Kerbal Space Program: The Prequel 




 A few days ago I landed on Minmus but realized I hadn't restored one of my science instruments, so I went down from the orbital station with a jetpack -if it weren't for ragdolling, I wouldn't have enough monoprop left to do that. 




 I strongly disagree, ragdolling is very fun in KSP. I would keep the ragdolling but as other people have pointed out in this thread, the issue is the recovery. When you want to ragdoll you just let it be and when you don't you should be able to instantly recover. 




 Why do you think it doesn't fit? 




 There was a thread when OP asked what would people do with their clone. A lot of people answered they'd fuck themselves. So, if you'd fuck your clone, your copy must also be pretty much into it. 




 Why? 




 If dV requirements stayed the same, then from Eve to low Moho orbit is is takes 1600 m/s of dV according to this tool

http://ksp.olex.biz/

Something something Oberth effect, like in a sense that a burn is more efficient when done closer to the source of gravity or whatever (except in case of plane change), so it is not very much higher with planets closer to the Sun.

 My brain hurts. 




 I dare not guess. But the idea of an interplanetary orbital station which flies from place to place stripping places of their fuel and science is strangely attractive. Maybe even smaller inter-asteroid station would pay off with science gains (considering the negligible dV requirements for moving between them). 




 Moho and Tylo are like muggers who stop you in an underground crossing at night and take all your dV.

Eve and Laythe are like pedophiles who lure Kerblings into their cellars with science and lock them up.

 From my experience, NERVA tended to overheat when on a large craft, but it is still quite efficient. I think it would be amazing on very large crafts constructed in orbit, which I have never done. Eh, I think I should try it and fly it in orbit over Duna.

[My design is somewhat simpler](http://i.imgur.com/05wzTZL.jpg) (sorry for it not being transparent, there are two cubic struts on top of each other with 2 batteries and 2 seats on sides and 1 parachute on the top inside).  I tested it and it works, the fairings proved to be necessary since the heat/hot air killed the kerbal even behind the heat shield. The spin stabilization works, no need for a reaction wheel. 




 Can you think of some examples of religion-exclusivities?

 I hated playing it because of only one reason - it frikkin scared me. I don't like horror games - I can play some, though, like more action ones like L4D or KF -, call me a chicken but I can't do it. 

On my first playthrough I got scared shitless almost to the end of Ravenholm and I stopped playing there until two years later (recently), when I thought fuck it and finished the game with cheats - it made it much easier for me. Subsequently I made it through E1 and I have yet to complete E2.

I think best thing about HL games is the world itself, the lore, the story and the atmosphere - it is mysterious, alien, attractive, and desolate. I am no big HL fan, but there is much to be read about it on the internet.

 It is 1600 mHz and DDR3, it may not be listed on the website, but I see no reason it shouldn't work well together (given that other Vengeances of the same specification are there). I have to admit I didn't even check the specific model on my mobo's page because I didn't know I could, I just went with the general compatibility rules. 




 Just defended a Swagian castle with my men and the castle staff against 800something men (they retreated after I mauled 160 of them). So many soft peasant bodies down the cliff... 









 The building guides usually say what should be compatible with what. 




 I had read that it was supposed to creak, but I still thought my money went to the drain. :D 









 I had always had obsolete PCs, mostly second-hand - I had spent a good amount of time gazing at screenshots in game magazines, drooling and dreaming. I had never thought I would ever play those shiny shiny games. I know very well the ails of lowest setting gaming and slow 90s PCs. The breaking point came a year ago when I knew I would have a part-time job and I was wiser and knew that my dream could come true, especially thanks to Reddit.

Prior to the building I thoroughly went through every BaPC guide and BaPC-recommended guide to learn how to build a PC, I even went through rookie-mistake-horrors threads. When I finally picked the parts after some googling and consideration, I asked here if it is good and subsequently changed over half of the parts according to advice. I am not a good picker, I guess.

The building itself went good, though I was nervous as hell and it took me all day. Like "Gosh, my fingers sweat so much, argh, my hard-earned two-month pay have just gone out of window it will all burn out on the first go" everytime I touched anywhere. I don't think I should worry so much about touching the components, should I? The feeling when it turned on was worth it, though.

The sad thing is, I remember how to connect and take out parts and whatnot (during building I was surprised that I almost didn't need a guide how to connect the parts together, it is very obvious - literally, as BaPCers say, like a Lego), but by now I have wholly forgotten what to look for when picking parts (unlike some people here who just go to the store and casually pick up good compatible parts), but I suppose I can consult the internet when the need arises.

 What an accurate description! 









 I disagree a bit. It is now commonly thought that spirituality has to do with supernatural, but Saganian definition of spirituality applies to us all. I wish the word "spiritual" wasn't associated with the supernatural, superstitious or gullible.

 Spirit comes from the Latin word to breathe. What we breathe is air, which is certainly matter, however thin. Despite usage to the contrary, there is no necessary implication in the word spiritual that we are talking of anything other than matter (including the matter of which the brain is made), or anything outside the realm of science. On occasion, I will feel free to use the word. Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or of acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.
 




 I think that scientific understanding of the world can bring some consolation. You learn that all dies and ends, but however sad that is, it is okay and it is natural to be sad about that. Our little while living in this vast and wonderful cosmos is so much more precious.

 That would be sweet if doable. Rovers bounce horribly and are very unpractical atm. I think there should be at least an option to let rovers stick to terrain, because driving several tens of kilometers is just tedious with all the explosions and whatnot. It does not even have to be teleporting, I would love to be able to ride on planets discovering interesting locations, but as I say, riding rovers now is just terribly done. 




 A bug. Unfortunate. I encountered this with Jool in 1.0, under 1000 km there was a ghost force giving me velocity. 




 Don't timewarp so much. Often there will be some miscalculation or whatever with SOIs and it may throw you out of the system.

I think you could alter your orbit a little bit and see if you still get caught by Tylo, if not, then wait for a good opportunity to burn to get an intersect with Bop/Pol.

 Yes, I mean, if you read the Bible as a fantasy that it is, you can draw good lessons from that and discard the bad ones (like you can do with any other book). When you believe it is a innerant guide to life and morality, that is where the problem arises. 




 Why not both?

 Most libraries don't have the kind of money Best Buy does, though. 




 I work in a library as a shelver, and often I go pick up some book from the depository for someone - there are many tens of thousands of books and if some of my colleagues misshelved a book by just one shelf, it would practically be lost.

The visitors do that often and it is just by luck when I find out and shelve it correctly during my shift, and there is like one big audit a year for the public part of the library. Please, try to get books back to their place.

 Nope, [that sword](http://fable.wikia.com/wiki/Solus_Greatsword) is even more powerful. Curiously enough, according to wiki it seems that Sword of Aeons has been [grossly nerfed](http://fable.wikia.com/wiki/Sword_of_Aeons) in TLC, otherwise it would indeed be the most powerful one.

I wonder why, it defeats the purpose of having to kill your sis to obtain it. Solus Greatsword should be less powerful. 




 Oh man. I killed my sister in Fable 1 for that sword - the fact I have a sister IRL made it quite hard for me (there were even some tears). Little did I know that in TLC edition there were one more powerful sword...

 Would you just grow it for colours or what? We had microscopes and we identified them. Also, why the fuck do people sniff unknown growth on petri dishes? In my class we would get likely berated for that. Geez, I miss my microbiology class... 




 We had a pretty good microbiology lab in high school and we tested stuff and sometimes pathogen appeared - of course, we were careful with that. It may have been against the regulations, but our teacher took it as an opportunity to encounter some real dangerous microorganisms.

 Due to how many lies, disinformation and so on has been spread through the whole history, I think that only convincing evidence would have to be a hard physical kind, measurable, repeatable, unambiguous and concrete. 




 Indoctrination, magical thinking, lack of understanding of scientific method, widespread disinformation, you name it.

 It seems to me a special kind of mental gymnastics after supposing that the universe might have had a simple external cause to be able to somehow connect it with some very specific god like the Christian one and all the religious mythology.

 I think some of the stages are actually pretty fun - bacterial stage and civilization stages stand out for me, others would need a major revamp.

 You may not believe how hard it is to find a butt turned away when you're looking for it. All full buttholes, spreadeagles and other kinky explicit things, but you have to search a while for a classy butt.

The shit is surprisingly easy to find, though. 




 I dislike very much when people call those people "nice guys" - suddenly "nice" is not a good pleasant quality to find in a human, but a part of a mocking stereotype. I think I am a nice guy, I try to be, but I am not a stereotypical "nice guy". 




 I absolutely hate that stereotype, it stigmatizes us and many kind and friendly people who happen to have some of the characteristics of the stereotype.

 Imo videogames can be very enriching experiences. You can learn from them and try things you couldn't in real life, they provide catharsis from stress and much more.

 Sometimes I think that I waste my life with videogames, but other times I see that it is not necessarily bad. "Get a life" is a poor argument, because "getting a life" is not very well defined activity - I have a feeling that is mostly mean "be a complete square", because it is often used at gamers, anime fans and other such subcultures.

Of course it is not the real thing you, but you can draw insights and ideas from them, and it can change your view on certain subjects or even life itself. Experiences are not just physical activities, mental experience counts too - reading a book is similar, though not interactive, and most people consider this and that book to be an experience. Thus, I conclude that it can't be said that videogames are not experiences. 




 Kerbal Space Program:

- total lack of documentation of controls

- as of yet no 64-bit

- waste of educational potential; it is educational in itself, but if there was a in-game wiki friendly explaining the science and mathematics behind the orbital mechanics, it would have been enourmously advantageous - games are the most natural form of learning

- lack of some underlining story - afaik the easter eggs were planned to have been connected and to point to a faraway planet whence Kerbals come from

- I was actually kind of disappointed when I heard that the Kerbol system is actually unrealistically small. It might have been better with real-scaled planets

- lack of faster time warp - as RSS shows, it is doable, and waiting isn't much fun

- Lack of more structures on the planets and moons

I could find a lot more

 It always makes me think what those people think it is about the age of consent that somehow magically makes fucking someone who was 15 the day before when it was "wrong by most people's moral code" absolutely OK the next day? (age of consent is 16 in many countries, mind you) Fucking a 9 year old (let alone a toddler) would, I think, be "wrong by most people's moral code", but the claim that with 15 year olds it's the same is just silly. 




 Of course it's not real.  




 It's amazing how Reddit always hops on subculture hate trains. I am not a furry, but I don't see anything wrong with furries. 




 I'd imagine that some cities weren't affected at all (except by nuclear winter). There would be some mutants, but nothing worse than before. 




 I don't know if interesting, but quite embarrassing - when I was in primary school, one winter day I and my classmate were going to wait for the public transport and we somehow thought it would be fun to throw chunks of frozen snow in front of passing cars. We kept doing it for a few minutes and then a policeman came from the nearby police station (it was in fact next to a police station) and warned us not to do that

It was incredibly stupid.

 I was playing on a crappy PCs until a year or so ago when I built my own powerful PC. As always, at first sight 60fps is butter smooth and you get used to it, so it doesn't even seem so after while. But then you get a game where fps was locked at 30fps and it takes a while to get used to it and it looks quite jittery at first or even after during quick camera movements.

 Ayy, Vietnam flashbacks! 




 The thing is that the religion virus preys on naturally selected human characteristics like pareidolia, superstition, pattern-recognition abilities (these three got a lot in common), the drive to protect offsprings, the self-preservation instinct, and other things.

You gotta train and educate people in critical thinking and skepticism to recognize inborn human fallabilities, whereas faith and religion thrive on the lack of these things.

It's a hard fight, and it may be that some form of religion always arises and it is thus virtually unweedable, but it is worth trying to get people to be more reasonable, because it brings progress.

One of the things I hope I live to witness to, though, is humans landing on Mars. There is at least a possibility that in some martian rocks there are fossilized microorganisms. 




 I am under the impression that they actually [confirmed](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/18/philae-lander-comet-surface-detects-organic-molecules) presence of organics. It is not that of a big deal, since we know simple organic molecules are pretty common. 




 Hi, I am mainly a hoarder of pictures (26k so far, all handpicked) and I was wondering if there is a simple utility to download them for me.

This one site regularly links to pictures (mainly on deviantart), and it would be good if the utility could be set to identify the posts with linked pictures, get their links and download them in full resolution? 




 thank mr. skeltal

 Oh bot, you so silly.

 I was thinking about Philae today, glad to hear it is back. 




 I got a 2 GB and several hundred MB ones, but I have since disassembled them (fuckers are extremely tough to crack) and use the magnets as key holders. 




 No, people keep asking, though, so here's a copypasta of the explanation:

It has to do with panting. "Funt" means to pant in Czech and when I was little and used to go to school with my sister I would pant because she was bigger and older than me and I had problems to catch up with her. Idk exactly when it happened, but she called me "funk" a couple of times, I think, and I made a nickname out of it later. It is not easily translatable, but I think "the little one who pants" could be fitting. 




 Thanks for reality check.

 The depth is fixed, but you can put the drills lower on the rocket so that they don't go so deep. 




 It's not cheating, but it helps greatly to have it. Without it you have to overengineer a lot because you don't precisely know dV and TWR data.

It's better for you if you learn to eyeball it first imo, though, 




 I just fly before the port with RCS, roughly align myself (viewing both vessels and their relative position from different angles), and then slowly flying towards it and aligning it better. I use no mods.

The attractive properties of KSP ports also help, because even if you align the rockets imperfectly it will latch. 




 Try to fly it to another spot on the asteroid, and/or deeper/shallower drilling (or reinstall KSP/verify cache).

 Is there a sub for greentext gaming stories? I have read quite a few, but only in their respective threads. 




 Except *the proteins*,  of course.  




 Who says I form an identity over it? I use the word, because it is shorter than "a fan of My Little Pony :Friendship is Magic". Even if I did, i don't see anything inherently wrong with it if it doesn't hurt anybody else. 

And I hardly ever talk about it with non-bronies, much less shove it to people's faces.

 Very cool. It shows how slow the movement really is. That makes me wonder, what do the rover operators do while the signals travel back and forth? Do they decide what the rover should explore next or do they browse Facebook and dank memes? 




 AND they don't use timewarp, which is quite impressive, really. 




 Because it was such a big claim, I (who, I admit, usually don't read papers, yes I know, I should probably start) read [this paper](http://www.esciencecentral.org/journals/rosetta-studies-of-comet-pchuryumovgerasimenko-prospects-for-establishing-cometary-biology-2332-2519.1000126.pdf) of his yesterday but still remained unconvinced. 




 Could you give him at least due credit for his theory of stellar nucleosynthesis? 




 I am not sure it would cause mass panic. Sure, it would cause a massive amount of stir, but why panic? Some religious groups would go out of their way to deny that, conspiracy theorists would have group orgasm, plethora dank memes would be spawned, but nothing that would affect everyday life in any way.

I just don't see that much happening.





 




 Fucking casuals. 




 Have you read the conversation below? I don't think they were joking.  




 Friggin modders. 




 In a broad sense a brony is just a person who likes the show and calls themselves that, it doesn't imply much more. 




 Sure, because liking things is creepy. /s

Get over yourself. 




 Nice. 




 Relevant Pepe is relevant. 




 Mountain Dew is always filled with piss, no matter if opened. But only the original piss is tasty. 




 Sweet rig, tho. But really should clean up those bottles. 




 Not so bad, just old and with marks from being soaked with something/spilled on. 









 Yes, I have.  I am a brony, and I know people who have their rooms full of merchandise (i don't), but that doesn't mean they're creepy (most of them are kind, friendly people, who just enjoy it). If they ever do some doll photo op like this, they do it in jest.

That said, there are people who are actually mentally unwell and delusional about their waifus (the word is also mostly used ironically) - I recall one who was **really** possesive about one of the characters and had all sorts of fantasies about their mutual love and was jealous of others liking her, really argumentative about it; was allegedly also physically violent toward his classmates -, but that is more of an exception. 




 I doubt they actually think like that, it's just like a stuffed animal and you pretend to make food for it for Fb, but of course it's understood that you make food for yourself. 




 That doll was supposed to be cute, but from this angle looks like an old woman. 




 I find the first one funny :D

It also reminds me of something, can't remember what it was :/ 




 or /r/TheDepthsBelow  




 Go away, Pao. 




 I know, I was just thinking that such a thing wouldn't be physically possible. (as opposed to some other imaginary network themes) 




 I haven't. Some random guy on FB has this as his cover photo, and I though it was cool. 




 Aren't all world eaters imaginery, though? 




 This is art. 




 I am not saying it isn't. 




 No. Would she use the word "fat" for describing this girl? :P 




 I agree. And there are two more reasons I stopped playing. 

1. I am a chicken, so I played on Peaceful. But on Peaceful you can't craft many items because there are no materials that only come from monsters. (it was more than a year since I last seriously played MC, so correct me if I am wrong)

2. There are so many craftable items, but there is no ingame documentation. I get that it is meant to be discovered by the player, but I think there should be ingame wiki for those that want it. The need to have MC wiki open in the browser ruins immersion. 




 Well, yeah, I guess. Maybe she wanted to show off the booty her uncle is getting...? 




 I don't think people here would mind that if she wasn't fat. 




 What if you're jumping to conclusions? 




 Thanks, I like nice art. 




 Ask the guy. 




 What if it's not her biological uncle? 




 Yea, I think so. (though there are people who can draw photorealistic sceneries) 




 I am pleased that this is a thing.

 That is the point when we become figurative hivemind. It is not perfect, but in a way the internet connects our very brains together. I mean, look at Reddit. It's a fascinating concept.

 No, no, no. It shouldn't end like this. The moment there is even a possibility their money slows their flow they cower in fear. Reddit should make them really remember. Reddit should keep going black, at least for several days, so they know the community are the ones with power, not them. If it stops now, they will not learn. 




 Still prefer Reddit tbh.

 There is a thing called defenestration. We Czech people have some history doing it. ;-) 




 This is the thing I remembered first too.

I think if more people read Carl Sagan's books, the world would be a better place. Basically everything he ever wrote was a gem, full of wisdom, challenging the reader to think about their own prejudices.

The Pale Blue Dot quote was my first introduction to Sagan, linked on Reddit. I cried for half an hour. 




 They only adopted gulag, we grew in it, were moulded by it. 




 I love Reddit as a community (and I would hate to lose all my history with this site tbh, and all the entertainment and dank memes), but things have to change. We must show that we will not submit to literal SJW moneygrabbing Hitlers that currently run the site. 

BTW frankly I enjoy this drama and rioty chaos, gives my popcorn a great flavor B-J 




 How much money would Reddit lose per day if all big subreddits gone private?

And who the fuck doesn't wipe and destroy memory cards fillled with CP if they are getting rid of it?!

 Humans are not born with developed bullshit detectors. If they don't know the criteria by which to judge if something is true, or if admitting they are wrong would contradict their deeply held beliefs, people will happily believe bullshit. Consider people who believe even the most credulous things (New Age woo etc...) without equally strong evidence.

People also do some pretty dumb stuff. Even if 50 % of the stories on the subreddits like /r/FloridaMan , /r/NewsOfTheStupid , or /r/offbeat were fake and the other 50 % true there would still be quite a few some pretty dumb stuff people do.

Have you read /u/MyLifeSuxNow's story about his bitch wife? Afaik in the end settled Reddit found out that it is made up when people were pointing inconsistencies in it. And yet, it wasn't a very credulous story, I could totally see that happen. I thought it plausible, so I believed it until other people called BS. No big deal, it was just a funny story anyway.

And it is by no means the only example of me being fooled by a story and it most probably won't be the last. Hell, I even believed some of the more known conspiracies when I was younger and less educated - I think it's important I remind myself of it every so often, just to be more compassionate to other people. I am not perfect.

BTW  with "there is a real contingent out there who literally wants to "kill all cis white men"" part you reminded me of something I heard in one podcast, where the podcaster gave a story how he and some guy with a different opinion fiercely argued over the internet and called each other names, yet when they incidentally met IRL they laughed at it and had a reasonable civil discussion. I think most people would also be civil in such a situation. 




 It's not just about "going outside", that is all I meant to say with my comment. 




 Can you actually offer some reasonable argument or are you gonna keep using that stupid stereotype? 




 wat :D 




 have you heard about balaka and anti-balaka in africa? religious clashes in india? extreme buddhism? 




 I struggle to learn to be more civil on the internet, as there is always someone who doesn't know something others do or who can't recognize something to be fake as well as others. We've all been there.

 




 That's one effing tight edit.
