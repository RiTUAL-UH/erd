 Great question. A wallet with $500 hidden that well makes me think they were pot seeds from some righteous plant. I was more concerned with my sisters friends coming over  which is why I was hiding in the closet to being with... Nine-year-old me had some game.  




 'Draw' numbers one through ten represented by dots in a pattern and some simple math from there. Then breakfast burritos.  




 I found a wallet with $500 and a small envelope of seeds tucked in the frame of the inside of a closet (where the moulding would be). I was pretty young and showed my mom... real slick. The thought of how many WarHeads and candy cigars that could have bought kills me.

 Eh, kind of. I dropped out of college after my first year because my band got picked up by an independent label. Long story short, after some cool shows and a lot of fun, I ended up working nightshift in a factory. Went back to school and now work in a research lab, live with my SO, and come home to her and my dog each day. Not quite the rockstar life I thought I'd live, but honestly, I like this one better.

 Walked into the house after a particularly long day at work to fresh baked Guinness stout chocolate cake (Yes, cake made with beer), Metallica slamming out of the stereo, an Allagash White, and a backrub.

 Think of the brain in terms of musicians. Each region of the brain has a set of different tasks that it performs and one that it is typically known to be 'responsible' for. In this sense the frontal cortex (The outer part of your brain just behind your forehead) controls your higher-thinking processes but is 'known' to be, generally, responsible for your personallity. The cerebellum, the little baseball-looking lobe at the lower backof your brain controls things like muscle memory and muscle tone, but is generally taught to be 'responsible' for fine motor coordination. 

Now, just like a lot of artists who have many songs (in the case of the brain - functions) the brain regions might have "one-hit-wonders" which are the functions that people usually remember. Name one song, without google, that MC Hammer did that was not 'Can't Touch This'. Most of us cant. That's how we end up saying that the occipital lobe (Back outer part of your brain behind that pointy part in the back of your skull) because known as the visual center. As with every one-hit-wonder some artist will write a cover song! There are many parts of the brain that are responsible for many tasks and there is a lot of overlap between them (There are 45 centers in the brain that play a role in vision) and can even 'rescue' the functions is others become damaged. 

The parts I mentioned above are more responsible for less vital functions. That is to say that if they became damaged you most likely would still survive but could become deaf, blind, develop cognitive defects, etc. You mentioned blood pumping and breathing. Well those are controled by the inner part of your brain, what's in the center and at the top of the spinal cord. Those parts control vital senses that are absolutely necessary for you to live. damaging that part usually results in death. 

Now the awesome and amazing part is that all of these things are happening all at once. If we're thinking about parts of brains as musicians who are playing their whole discography and their well known hits and some are covering songs written by others then we can think of the brain as SXSW. This orchestra of musicians all playing at once and working together is what allows us to run (Primary motor cortex, at the top of your head and cerabellum among others) and to read (occipital lobe, and frontal lobe among others).

Hope that helps! 




 The Limulus immune system is pretty simple. It's composed of the amebocyte, plasma, and a few proteins. To be honest, my largest body of knowledge is into their nervous system (primarily molecular and electrophysiological). But [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873049/) abstract gives a decent overview. They're a pretty amazing creature. If nothing else, they pre-date dinosaurs and yet we can go to the beach and see them each spring/summer. 




 It stands that we (the royal we/academic community) dont know as much as we need to. Unfortunately there are not any real regulations against harvesting and bleeding crabs. Hopefully more new [research](http://www.biolbull.org/content/225/3/137.abstract) will bring this more to the public eye. Sadly, once the crabs are released back to the wild after they are bled, it is not unheard of for a crab to be re-collected by mistake and bled a second time, thus killing the crab. [Here](http://limulus.mx/lo-que-late-dentro-de-una-sangre-azul/?lang=en) is pretty cool article about how their blood 'works'.

 When you look at the stars you are seeing a collage of the past. You're seeing light from stars as they were thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of years ago. Many of them may not even exist any more and yet we see them as they were. So when you look to the sky at night you are seeing many pasts during your present. 

Also - first post! I've been lurking for the right thread 
























 I work in an R D lab... You're right, it probably is the custodian performing an experiment and settling the over/under debate once and for all.  














 If you don't have one, make a duplicate of your car key. You'll want to let it run for a few minutes before you drive off in the morning. Nothing sucks more than locking your keys in the car at 5am when its -10. Also look for a place with off street parking if possible - this is key if you're moving to the Portland area.  During heavy storms all cars must be removed from street parking to clear the road for plows and it can be a major hassle to find a spot.  




 Not going to lie, I'll throw in some Austrian Death Machine for a laugh or two. But if we're talking about just sweet jams that put us in a good mood - I've been digging Vildhjartas Mastaaden album.  









 Howdy! Just curious - how do you all typically store your iaito after practice, specifically, the sageo? Does it differ from post dojo or post home practice? I'll usually wrap a neat loop around the midpoint of the saya with a slipknot as we wrap up at the dojo, but I'll do a cho musubi after home practice. The difference is mostly time. What do you all do and why?
 




 Last night was date night and I surprised the better half with a show in Portland. Vivid Motions production [Thug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXF_rui1ZWM). It is a 'dance theater' that tells the all-too-real story of a kid in Portland who grows through death, abuse, and mental illness. It was absolutely stellar; If you're looking for something to do this weekend certainly check this out!

I grew up in West Lebanon/Hanover NH (Where Dartmouth is) and it is surprising rough in certain parts; big heroin problem. A few years back some junky was calling for pizza deliveries and robbing the delivery drivers at gun point... on Dartmouth campus and throughout town.  




 Senior year of high school I asked my best friend to go to prom with me. She said 'yes' so I started making plans and when I told her what time I'd pick her up she was shocked. It turns out that she said "if my current date falls through, then yes"... I had two days to find a new date and successfully convinced my best friend that I'm an idiot. We didn't go to prom together, but, we've since been together for 8 years.

 Some what tangential but I was at an animal behavior seminar (I work for a veterinary diagnostics biotech company) and one of the presenters who studies wild dogs and wolves indicated that muzzle and face 'biting' among dogs is a symbol of affection.

 No problem! It's a lot of fun and there are always things going on with the program as far as activities and events. Here is the site:

 Portland mentoring alliance through portland high school. You are matched with a student with whom you have similar interests and you spend time each week doing something you both enjoy. It can be hugely important to some of the kids and is a pretty fun program. Its a great way to help at risk kids keep out of trouble and to help other kids learn more about the world and get them through that awkward process of becoming an adult. They always need mentors, especially male mentors. 




 This. My SO and I play a game we call 'Left, Right, Straight' in which we drive/walk around town and pick random turns at each intersection. We've discovered a lot of awesome stuff about our city doing this. If you have GPS on your phone you've got nothing to worry about; just have fun. 




 Thanks! The leave it command sounds like it might be a huge help in this; I hadn't even thought about it for squirrels! 




 Thanks for all of the info! She certainly has a big personality. She does have the husky independence but that is overlayed by the  Basenjii stubbornness. There are days where she listens great and others where the only reason I know she hasn't gone deaf is her running to the sound of me making a peanut butter sandwich. If she doesn't want to do something she will protest the whole way.

I'm going to work on trying some of her commands in different environments, that's a pretty solid bit of insight! We do short leash her when we walk past a few certain houses and cherry trees but I want to try to break her from the habit of eating everything. I'm afraid she's going to swallow something dangerous that we might not have been able to spot in the grass some day. 

Thanks again! 




 She's got a pretty good drop it but she keeps going if it's something she can eat. I'll check out the links to see if there is a better way to deploy it than we currently are. Thanks!

As for the interactive toy - We tried that one. She likes to take things apart if it's possible. She burns through the 'indestructible' toys in no time. Any feeder toys that are as rugged as the 'black Kong' that you'd recommend? 




 Just discovered this sub. So far there is a lot of good information but so far I've yet to stumble across a thread with the answers I'm hoping to find. 

We adopted a 2yo Husky/Basenji/Border Collie mix this past March and she walks very well on a leash over all, but, often times she can be pretty difficult. She tries to eat everything on the ground; berries, trash, bugs, etc. We feed her a stable diet that our vet approves of (activity level and weight appropriate 2x a day at regular times) but it makes no difference. We've tried walking using small treats and redirection but that still didn't help. She does eat incredible quickly at breakfast and dinner and when we are putting food in her dish will do every trick she knows at once (It actually is as funny and endearing as it sounds). She loves to eat but we keep her at the target weight assigned by our vet.

Eventually we'd like to train her off leash but it's seeming that between her prey drive (She locks on to any squirrel or bird) and her focus on what might be edible on the ground suggest that it might not be a possibility in the near future. 

Any tips on how to get her to stop trying to eat the neighborhood trash? Bonus tips for working on prey drive (We currently make her sit, redirect her attention to us, and wait for her calm down when she locks on to a squirrel.)?

Thanks! 




 
* Fort Williams and the Portland headlight in Cape Elizabeth are pretty excellent if you like the cliff over the ocean feel.
* take a ferry from Commercial st to any of the islands or just ride one around the loop to see the coast and skyline
* Check out the cemetery on Stevens ave. I know it sounds a bit macabre but it truly is scenic and beautiful. All of the statues and monuments make it feel like walking through a museum and there is a small duck pond in the back. 
* Deering Oaks park has some nice scenery and usually some cool stuff going on. Bintliffs Cafe right off the park has the best brunch in the city IMO. There is also The Holy Donut right there which makes some of the best you'll ever have.
*   Riverton trolley park has trails through the woods that are literally impossible to get lost on and have cool stuff to look at like a river and a 'castle' wall. The Alligash Brewery is right across the street and will serve you with a free flight of their beers upon walking in.
* The back bay has a 3 mile trail loop as well as some benches and cool views of the city skyline. Not too far down the street is my favorite sandwich shop called The Local Press (woodford st) which is a must try. 
* if you're looking to get out of the cold and grab a drink or food check out Novare Res for over 500 beers and small but pretty impressive food plates (Crab Rangoon grilled cheese sandwiches are killer) or Sillys for a pretty cool menus and stellar shakes.

 I've recently started learning Toyama ryu (I practice MSR) to 'save my knees/legs' from over training. Toyama is a requirement for nidan testing in my organization so it is something I will need to learn anyway. My question is this - in the fourth form, Ushiro, there is a moment where both arms open and the chest is completely exposed. What is the purpose of this? My instructor believes it is to generate power or that it may possibly be to 'move bystanders' out of the way. Any insight? 




 One major contributing factor is what is called your chronotype. Tons of functions in our bodies are governed by cirvadian rythems which are ~24 hour cycles that influence the way many functions in your body work. An example of this is how you always seem to get hungry around the same time each day, or better for this thread, how you get jet lagged when you fly a few timezones away. You have a set of very specific proteins that, through a relay of 'signals' in your brain, adjust to light/dark cycles. These proteins interact to make a 'clock'. This clock has an output which could be anything from releasing certain hormones to make you sleepy to raising or lowering your body temperature. Now here is where chronotype comes in. Each "healthy" persons brain chemistry functions largely the same but with some differences - timing of protein and gene interactions are among them. Some people, no matter how regular and consistent their schedule or routine will always function better when they wake up late. Some earlier. It comes down to environment, life style, and genetics. Hope this helps!

 Here's the deal: I have been searching for an original (not the re-issue) Washburn HM-20V for over ten years and have been unsuccessful. I have scoured ebay but managed to either miss a decent auction or have not been willing to shell out $800 for a guitar with a broken head-stock and bent truss rod. I've given my phone number to all of the local and semi-local guitar shops and haunted message boards; I've searched Craigslist for most major US cities. A few years back when they were first released I picked up a BSG Customs M-20 (run of 50 HM-20V re-issues before the mass re-issue). I love everything about it. I played with a guy who had an 80's HM-5V and it wasn't half bad. 
Now my question is this. Has anyone played the HM-20V or even own one? Is my white whale worth the hunt, or are the odds so dismal I should just resign myself to not finding one?  




 Have you seen "The divide" if not I think you'd cry alone in the corner and contemplate what's worth living for. FTFY ;-) 
























 Probably not very helpful opinion but as you said, these are ahistorical. There is a reason these swords were invented for the movies... If you're looking to cut than I'd hugely recommend a more traditional Katana. The curvature of the blade, while an artifact of production, helps hugely with slicing. The major issue is that these are slicing weapons, not chopping. As such if you're looking for functionality I'd go with what's been historically tested and proven. Just my two cents. 




 The Arcadia National Bar is perfect for a bachelor party... Beer and arcade games. 




 It seems like something worthwhile to learn, even if you don't do it for practical reasons. It'll certainly increase understanding of the iaito (shinken, etc) if ntohing else 




 I'll certainly try adding another Seppa, I don't think there is that much play, but it's something I've been toying around with in my head for a while. What about using some thin copper sheet and cutting my own seppa? 




 Treat it with Beeswax... I see where this could certainly help, but would you mind going into more details as to why and how you do it?

Thanks! 




 so I purchased a [tozando toryumon classic iaito]( http://www.tozandoshop.com/Toryumon-Classic-FAST-SHIPPING-p/070-toryumon[fast].htm) about 6 months ago and so far its held up well enough but it has developed a bit of play in the tsuba and the samegawa/ito is shrinking or slipping. I would imagine with a lower end iaito this would be common. I do practice frequently but take excellent care of my equipment. this raises a couple of questions  - what are some common issues with iaito (or any gear like hakama, etc) that are treatable or even preventable. what do you do that other might not know about? 

E: [images of ito and samegawa wear]( http://imgur.com/N1MDaSK,H7vpooI) 




 Late to the party here but a couple of points:

- read up on [Miyamoto Musashi](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi). He is a historical, and legendary, samurai. Musashi was most famous for writing Go Rin No Sho (the book of five rings) which was a book on tactics and swordsmanship. Find a decent translation and give it a read. But prior to writing it he was heralded as one of Japans greatest swordsmen... Ever. Among Hus feats was defeating a man named Kojiro who wielded an odachi. Musashi allegedly carved one of his own from a boat oar to win the duel. Also relevant to you is his development of a style called Hyoho niten ichi ryu. Niten ichi ryu is centered on using the katana and wakizashi together and simultaneously. Very unusual.

- As an iaido student believe me when i tell you this: one handed odachi is not the best choice. Super human strength (mentioned in other comments) will work  only in suspending belief but not to anyone with practical historical context. The katana and odachi both are slicing weapons, not chopping. Propper cutting is wildly difficult to do even with years of practice.  A factor to consider is that a good cur must come from using your core muscles and legs. This requires both arms to do well. Clearly this is not an absolute as musashi was able to make effective cuts with one hand but its wily atypical.

- short of trying some classes yourself check out some iaido and kenjutsu videos on YouTube. Any koryu videos will provide a good context of what good Japanese sword techniques should look like.

- at the end of the day its your book and write what you love. Two quick and awesome reads would be the book of five rings and the Hagakure. They'll give you a lot of historical context. Just make sure you find a martial translation rather than philosophical or business related. 




 Oh for sure! but what you don't want to do is take them unless you're I'll. Sugar and especially salt have so many field uses (sterilization, treating oral injuries, etc) that its useful to have raw. Also this mixture will replace sodium, chloride, and iodine ions you lose in sweat, urine, and stool as well as help supply glucose to your nervous system to combat dehydration. Its not to be used to combat illness but rather to rehydrate and make the infection less life threatening. 




 One huge thing you can add to an altoids kit is salt and sugar. Instead of using packets buy a pack of drinking straws (preferably multiple colors) and pinch one end with needle-nose plyers over a candle to crimp. Measure in 1 table spoon of salt. Crimp open end same as first. Repeat for sugar. This will create waterproof and compact storage. The W.H.O recommends treatment for diarrheal diseases and dehydration with a mixture of salt and sugar in clean water (where there is no access to medicine or medical attention. Eg refugee camps). I'm on mobile and don't remember the ratios but a quick Google search will pull that up.

 That book... just... I don't even know what to say about that one scene in the cave. You know the one. Only King could write that and not have Chris Hansen kick in his door with the Dateline crew.

 Oh for certain. And that's a great point - its the classic "ninja" sword I was referring to; I could have spoken more clearly. I think that the sword in Japan has an incredible history and is an amazing feat of engineering (in its simple elegance rather than complexity). I just see the henain period and on as producing some of histories most incredible swords. The change in sword geometry calls for a change in cutting technique. As an iaido student I know how to cut as taught by my school and its lineage, that's an incredibly narrow part of the picture.

 I have to be honest, as a "gun nut" I am shocked that this is just now a thing in Texas. It is like this in New Hampshire, the 'Live Free or Die' state; as it should be. Someone who physically, emotionally, or otherwise abuses anyone, let alone a partner or family member clearly is not responsible enough to keep and maintain a firearm. That person needs help. While it is difficult to say whether they have less of a right to defend themselves I have to say, in these instances yes, they do have less of a right. They lost that right when they abused an individual. 




 You'll have a much easier time with cats than a dog. Like everyone said, just ask. This should go without saying, but, if your emailing: proofread, use complete sentences, and be professional.

 This American Life did an awesome episode with something very similar but in Freedom NH. Look it up and give it a listen if you need some inspiration.  




 I don't dislike all books that have religion. Like I said, I find theology fascinating and extremely fertile ground for excellent stories. What I dislike is authors who treat religion as "I believe this. This is the truth" rather than "I believe this; what do you think". 




 I guess what I am trying to say with the 'ideals' comment is that I would like the freedom to interpret a story for a meaning that I can resonate with. I am a huge Stephen King fan; in a lot of his books he has religious undertones, etc but he uses them in a way, that while possibly representative of his beliefs, they are open to interpretation and are non-alienating. What I dislike is authors who treat religion as "I believe this. This is the truth" rather than "I believe this; what do you think".  




 What gets to me is when the book  is used as a vehicle to propel an individuals ideals. The Shack for example was a great concept for an excellent novel, but was essentially a sermon. While I am an agnostic (I admittedly lean towards atheism) I respect and support all religious beliefs and will continue to do so until there is empiracle evidence one way or the other, and will always respect an individuals believes regardless of their validity. I find theology fascinating and see a huge amount of potential in it as a tool or topic. I become turned off when the story feels cheapened because the author writes it to talk about his religion. Those are typically books I'd avoid, but that's difficult in instances like The Shack. 

As an aside I do become agitated with false logic. As a scientist I have the obligation to remain open minded to all possibilities but also an obligation to laws of nature and logical reasoning. There is a book titled something like 'Why science can't disprove god' which sets out to say god must be real because science can't prove otherwise. That's wrong on several levels - primarily in that the burden of proof lie with the accusor (If you say something is real you must provide the evidence; I.e Bigfoot) and that **science is not an enemy or religion**. We simply cannot test it so we move on and concern ourselves with things we can. 




 That's exactly where I was going with the religious thing. 




 What things can you just not get through the moment it is brought up. For me it is religion; it just kills a book dead in the water. For some reasons I have an easier time believing and accepting in Westeros and Hogwarts. Prime examples are The Shack (Young?) and Cronins The Passage (Incredible book; what saved it was him leaving it open to interpretation rather than saying God is real).

So what kills an otherwise good book for you? 




 Excellent post. I will say, however, it feels very much the heart and soul of Numenera... Check it out if you haven't yet.  




 Whoa, what do you think you're doing? Only Garth and I get to make Wayne's World references! 




 This studio we recorded in had this clock that would play Westminster Chimes (you know the tune if you hear it) ever hour. We heard it so often that our drummer would subconsciously pick up a guitar and start playing it at random. It was a pretty good laugh 




 YouTube - I have been listening to Audio Books at work for the last year (Got tired of exhausting podcast archives). I have almost always found what I was looking for on YouTube.  




 Be careful of letting people over hype it - I hated Avatar because I was expecting something magnificent and earth shattering, not just a better, blue Pocahontas. That being said, I didn't read it until I was 23 and it kicked my ass. I typically love dark books (Cormac McCarthy, Stephen King, etc) but HP series managed to keep me enthralled through all 8 books; took me through the entire emotional spectrum; AND delivered to my tastes for the bleak. The continuity is air tight as well. Great series.  




 Over production. I had to stop listening to Stephen Kings 'Insomnia' because of the music that would play intermittently OVER the reader. Admittedly it was a pretty cool lead but too distracting.

 Moved here a few years ago from NH and love it. I've lived three different Portland neighborhoods and honestly the only real drawbacks are: Tax, especially being from NH. Our lovely Governor is bat shit crazy... And just got re elected.

I love the cultural diversity, the food, the sports, the events... Wouldn't want to be anywhere else 




 Oh I get that. Remember the days of AOL Chat Room play-by-post games? ... what ever happened to those any way? 




 I've never played on those sites, just looked at some games. What beurocracy is there? 




 They are a notoriously terrible telecom company that is  consistently in hot water for shady business practices and horrendous customer interactions... And they have a monopoly in several areas of the US (like my city) 









 Would I be able to consolidate having several different servicers? Is it possible to consolidate the loan that's in my parents name?

Good luck with the pay as you earn! I did Income based for a couple of years until I finally landed a decent FT job in my field and it was a huge help.  




 Luckily no. My buddy was moving and I've always driven his truck in the past. Made him drive it this time and taught him how - How sick he got (nerves) made me wonder what would happen if he did hit something. 




 Hi PF (Insert obligatory "Long time lurker/first time poster comment here).

I have been paying back student loans for a while and I got to thinking that I must be doing something inefficiently. They are as follows:

Loans I've been paying:
Vermont Student Assistance Corp - Subsidised Stafford at 6.8% with a $2,133 balance down from $3,500
Sallie Mae private at 9.25% with a $2,868 balance down from $3,500
Sallie Mae private at 8.75% with a $983 balance down from $2,000

Loans just entering repayment:
NelNet - Subsidised at 5.6% with a balance of $3,500
NelNet - Subsidised at 4.5$ with a balance of $4,500
NelNet - Subsidised at 3.4% with a balance of $11,000
NelNet - Unsibsidised at 6.8% with a balance of $25,500

Granite State Management and Resources - Parent Plus loan - Some where in the $10,000 range down from $20,000 (Monthly payment of $217; I've been paying this one for a few years)


My income:
$50,000 a year or $1,156 bi-weekly after tax, deductions, and savings (10% auto transferred into savings account each check). My (Non-loan) expenses are about $1,100 a month including rent, groceries, car insurance, phone, etc. I have no debts other than my student loans (I own my car and rent an apartment).

My Loan payments total up in the ballpark of $750 a month and there has to be a way to lower that number. I do pay at least double the minimum payments on the Sallie Mae and first subsidized loan. The Parent loan I don't have any information on as it is technically my fathers loan I am only an authorized payer on the account and cannot view any information; my dad has yet to send me the information. 

TL;DR - 50K in student loans, 50K in income. Read through the sidebar but need the ELI5. What's the most efficient way to pay them down? 
I read through the sidebar but could use something more watered down. I know next to nothing about loan consolidation or finance in general. Would anyone mind giving me some advice? Thanks!
 




 I got to thinking - they seem incredibly aggressive when it comes to their insurance policies. What's the deal? What was your experience like? 




 Danger! 




 That's the site! 




 No but I think Jennie McCarthy said the cause autism 




 Well I guess stealing Christmas counts as burglary  




 I would certainly be interested in this as well. Let me know if anything comes of this. I know it exists - I stumbled across a site once but can't remember what the hell it was. 




 His does it stack up to Taco Escobar? Granted TE is a bitch to get to and park during tourist season, but those nachos... 




 Check out his short story Willa. It was the perfect ending to that story. Other excellent endings are Nona and Typewriter of the Gods. All short stories and quick reads. Check them out, especially willa 




 I might just make this an adventure any way... Great idea! 




 But what if they're third-eye blind? Heh... I'll see myself out. 




 Try having them find something off of the corpse an explorer who never made it out. Maybe there is something that grows there of interest. Could be that there is a lonely traveler who is lost and driven to insanity... Maybe helping him out alive is worth their time

 Why is this so far down? Here, have an upvote from 65,000,000 B.C 




 The first is 3. After that its 2 each level applied 




 That looks like a pretty solid possibility! All I've been able to find thus far is a 'plank' of bamboo. Thanks! 




 I managed to find some wooden bookshelf pegs that are exactly the same size and shape as my mekugi, but they feel much softer. I am hoping that Tozando wouldn't commission their iaito parts from Ikea. I'm in the US.  




 Howdy,
   Recently my iaito (Tozando Toryumon series) has had some looseness in two areas. It started with tsuba rattle which I repaired by making an extra seppa out of thin brass sheet and by tapping the inner diameter of the tsuba with a punch. This fixed the problem, though after a couple of days I could feel some looseness between the nakago and tsuka, especially during suburi. I added a thin cardstock shim inside the tsuka which worked for a few days but now the nakago/tsuka looseness is back and is making a creaking sound.

I have consulted my instructor and he is heading to an aikido seminar later this month where there will also be a person who repairs iaito. He will be bringing my iaito with him to be looked at. 

I have stopped using it and it is being looked at by someone with more expertise than I.

That being said, would this nakago/tsuka looseness (And the associated creaking sound) be a result of worn mekugi? It does show visible wear. I cannot for the life of me find replacement mekugi at all, let alone mekugi that I can shape to my specific tsuka/mekugi-ana. All I've been able to find is smoked bamboo stock or "Use a chopstick". I'd rather not use a chopstick or bookshelf pegs, etc. I'd like to stick to smoked bamboo and ensure that I'm not damaging my iaito or creating an unsafe practice space. 

Any leads on where to find decent mekugi? Also any idea what, if not the mekugi, is causing this looseness and creaking?

Thanks! 




 There was an Adams Family cartoon episode about this. It was as awesome as it sounds. 




 Not enough warriors references on reddit 









 Use pool shock. Its typically 36 or so. Cleaned pools for a summer in college. Just be careful not to die when using that stuff. 




 Well that's just, like, your opinion, Man. I exclusively use 12s. 8s make a tiny raincloud in my heart 




 Willa by Stephen King 




 Oh, I know that guy; he's a nihilist. 




 I didn't know it even was a thing... But I guess we fry twinkies here so why not? 




 Pshh, ok Mr. Know it all. 




 I loved American Gods and Neverwhere. I think she'd dig some of his stuff for sure.  




 Its a haul from damriscotta but Weekend Anime in Westbrook has weekly DnD  




 My SO loves Harry Potter (Favorite books) and is trying to find that next book or series to grab hold of her. She hated the violence and gore of ASOIF and isn't big on Lord of the Rings either. Any fun series out there that an adult can relate to but spares extraneous violence, etc? 

EDIT: Thanks for all of the suggestions! I think I am going to take a swing at The Night Circus and maybe even a couple of the others. Who doesn't like options?

 I'm going to have to go with the 'sex scene' in Stephen Kings IT. SPOILER: in the book all six kids seal a pact by taking turns having sex with Bevvy... This scene of eleven-year-olds banging in an underground tunnel is described in all its creepy detail.
