 All about that flick bout that flick no tapping 




 That could be worst 




 Well I was just there with the Realtor, that place is beyond massive. To all the people who think it's not for sale, it definitely is. It's destroyed though, I'd say 150000 dollars just to keep it standing for 10 more years. 




 How is this creepy?  




 Welp just left my contact info. My so is either going to kill me or love it, then the asylum will probably kill me.

 The real nightmare is how often this gets reposted and still gets upvotes. 




 Just make sure you kill the skeleton lord that summons the pinwheels last, those things are a pain. 




 That's the mt Vernon infirmary that's for sale right? 40000 something square feet of that type of stuff... Lol 




 This makes me feel the teeth on my brain....

 Everyone knows this is from the film the lord of tears right? 




 I can't really tell when it stopped being intentional

 I use neko wool jap cotton. Most people don't realize you need to peel away the front and back layer of the sheet before wicking so it often gets bad reviews. 




 Just look up search by image on Google play or the app store. I'm not sure how exactly it works, but I know it searches for all sizes of the current image and returns visually similar images. All you have to do is select the image from your gallery and search. 




 I never said I was into it, but it's really not that bad 




 Where is the bear cub? 




 I've never seen a point made this well before... 




 Living in a remodeled uhaul truck until I'm done with a road trip, so I'd be a bit more concerned with the appearance of a hallway 




 I'm going to assume you've never heard of reverse image search?  
























 Um I guess that depends. I think there are some RDAs that have a kind of tank attachment but a true RDA is a "deck" you build your coils on. Instead of a glass tank you wick them with cotton and put your ejuice on the cotton, so when the coil(s) heat up it/they burn the juice off the cotton, giving you vapor. 




 A vape store owner I know runs .02 on a mephisto with an el diabolo 26650 mod. I've seen the build but am way too nervous to be around when he uses it. 




 What size wire and how many wraps? 




 No worries. Its rebuildable dripping atomizer. Look into them, you'll need one of them to get awesome clouds. The only tank I've ever seen that would give you a decent cloud is the arctic with the .2 coil, but that still could never compare to an RDA lol. 




 My two favorite mods are my el diabolo 26650 and my hammer of god that takes 4 18650s. I feel like a mod is only going to get you so far though, the RDA is (in my opinion) much more important. The best I've used were the Buddha zephyr, the 26650 mephisto, and the mutation. What RDA are you using now? 




 That's awesome! I've just heard stories about it melting so I've not really been interested lol 




 I've not used nickel yet, but with kanthal that would take a year to heat up! Lol 




 Came here to say this lol

 AND MY HAMMER 




 10/10 would eat TV dinner on.

I your hardware though! Have you been at it long? 




 I also come from the wonderful world of hookahs. A few burn holes in my carpet/couch/deck/everything motivated me to switch. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do! 




 Yeah me too. I've drawn up a lot of plans for a box similar to this, I'm a machinist so I could really go crazy with it. I'm a bit nervous though so I'm reading up a lot on the wiring and stuff. 4 batteries that close to my face, really wouldn't want to do that wrong! 




 I feel like not many people know about this guy (at least not many people around me), so I thought I'd share:

http://vaperzcloud.com/products/hammer-of-god-box

It was my first mod and it's still my favorite. 10/10 woud buy again. 




 I'm assuming its a compressed air cannon, which could toss somebody. I'd be more worried about his ears than anything. Saw this a year or so ago on YouTube and I feel like he got up afterwards.

 Okay, so I was wondering if you have a hammer of god (which has 4 batteries) would super sub-ohming be safer? I'm not big into low builds, but in my mind the load would be evenly distributed among all 4 batteries. Is that accurate? Why or why not? Are there any articles I could read on the subject? 




 Can we get a glow shot?! 




 Nah that should be fine. Right guys? Guys? 




 I've had that. I cheated against my girlfriend because I wanted to beat her just once. She had been cheating too so it became a game of luck. She still won. 




 Also came here to ask. 




 Off topic, but is 3/4th proper? 




 The best part is he takes the rock too. You can tell he's on a budget! 




 Did you bring your TURBO rda??! 




 Fair enough 




 I think we both know that no one thinks a dog has lived 7 years when we have lived 1. Their bodies are aged roughly 7 times faster than a humans though. 




 Couldn't you just close the door? 




 Did... Did you just say dogs don't age faster than we do? No one is saying that time passes faster for dogs, but they certainly do age much much faster. I'd like to see one external source that says otherwise. 




 He shouldn't have been standing in front of it in the first place though. 




 What if you'd have to drink the dick because you've been hitting it for so long 




 Kinda the same thing as a gentlemen's club I guess. Men come in to look at women. 




 Batman is in there twice too lol 









 Or is it incest?  




 I see that hammer pipe mod over on the left! I hated that thing... It looks nice but it's pretty finicky. If you're into spending any more money I'd look into the hammer of the gods box mod. It's my personal favorite. 




 If you like the freak show look for the mad hatter. Same manufacturer and they're both fantastic. 




 I said a year not two, that's just ridiculous. 




 Doesn't that take a year to heat up? 




 I bet that's got a good throat hit

 She's doing neither actually. Just acting completely normal. 




 Yeah I can tomorrow. It doesn't even look too bad the eye lid is just a bit red. Not even puffy really. Might it be possible she poked her eye with some hay? She does tend to toss it around and role in it... A lot... Lol 




 Will be worth noting that we opened a window and had a bunch of company the day prior. Maybe allergies? 




 My vape store will trade vented batteries for 50 off a new one, see if your will! 




 Hey, my rabbit is sick. One of her eyes is red and she's got a stuffy nose! She's still bouncing around and happy, eating (and tossing her bowl when she's done) with no sign of pain whatsoever. I'm thinking it may be a cold but I'm unsure. The vet literally won't do anything with her. Like that shouldn't even be a thing but he just keeps saying she's okay. The closest one is 3 miles away and I can walk that but the next one is 12 miles away. If it could be something serious I'll do it but she seems fine. Sometimes she'll close the eye but that's it. Any suggestions? 




 Is it the 18650 size or the 26650? 




 I'd have to say no on that... 




 Which mephisto? I've got an authentic mephisto RDA with a 26650 el diablo that work okay. Are the clones any good? I spent 100 on my RDA and for the price I'm disappointed. 




 When my girlfriend wants me to leave the vape store 




 With a 9 wrap parallel you'll get the same surface area as an 18 wrap with lower  though is the point I'm making I guess. But definitely if you can push more power through the coils you'll get comparable results. 




 Ohh okay I'm assuming you mean the box is series right? I only have unregulated mechanical boxes that are parallel so I don't actually have experience with controlling power levels. 




 What are the benefits of doing this instead of a 9 wrap parallel? Are you aiming for a longer ramp time? Not being sarcastic or anything I'm genuinely curious Lol 




 I believe so, I followed a tutorial online. This is the first real repair I've ever done to a car besides like breaks and stuff. 




 So what would you make of the smoke? If the pump is out I know it would leak but not at the back of the engine right? 




 I'm really hoping it was a miscommunication. I've had people tell me it wouldn't hold pressure with a blown head gasket, is that correct? 




 So that means replacing the water pump may do it? 




 Fill the back seat with bags of ice! 




 Edit: it is a 94 BMW 325i not a 328, not sure why the 8 is there.


Hello, I've been having some trouble with my BMW overheating. I bought this car because I wanted something nice to drive and also a car I could learn to work on. So today removed the radiator and the fan blades (?) To change the thermostat which went well but after reassembly when I turned it on and ran it for about 20 minutes it began over heating again! There is white smoke coming from under the left side of the engine which leads me to believe there could be a leaky head gasket but I noticed something rather peculiar. The hose to the right of the water pump was hot to the touch, but to the hose to left of it was much cooler (still hot, but not nearly as much). I took it to national tire and battery for a pressure check and they said it held 75lbs of pressure just fine. Any thought guys?



TLDR: 94 BMW 325i overheating, pressure check went well, small amount of white smoke coming from under engine on passenger side, changed thermostat and it didn't help. 




 He's one k away from racism 









 I've come to terms with it. How are they making the money to do this??? I've never seen something this overly advertised in my entire life!

 Kinda depends if it's a double cheeseburger. 
























 Out of juice for a few weeks, won't have the money for more until the first. Can anyone help me out? 




 I would replace it if you don't mind driving an older car. I wish I would have done that with my Sebring instead of getting my mazda 




 I've only found a hammer of God at one store, but the Buddha zephyr is pretty popular. There's also the fat Buddha which is geared more for flavor builds and there's the mangala which is a short version of the Buddha. All the parts for those 3 RDA's are interchangeable too which is nice. 




 Well I'll hit it for a good 4 or 5 usually, the awesome thing about royal wire is it heats up super fast but it takes forever to get too hot. I've used a ton of different wires and royal is my favorite by far. If you build you should try it out! 




 Better than I expected honestly. I mean a higher resistance would be better but I'm completely satisfied. It's a bit warm but its not bad.  




 My favorite build is the hammer of God box mod with the Buddha zephyr. The Buddha has a MASSIVE chuff cap and handles heat realllyyyyy well, and the deck has deep juice wells. Also, tons of building space. I run 4 vtc5 batteries in the mod but vtc4s are pretty fantastic too. I get a bit less flavor but the clouds are just massive. I'm going to get a lot of hate for this but I've got a .03 ohm build on it and it's never been even remotely a problem. All together it cost me about 300 dollars.

My build is a 6 wrap dual parallel 20g royal wire, so lots of surface area with a super low resistance wire. Flawless on every front. I've been in 4 cloud comps with it and never lost one. It outperforms my 26650 el diablo mod with the mephisto rda which costed me 350 dollars not counting batteries, wire, and cotton. 




 I think I'd be too tempted to fire it... 




 It just seems to be the common consensus from the people I've asked. Do you know the other things that will be required after engine replacement.? 




 I've heard the head gasket goes out faster after you fix it, so for the same money I can swap the engine and solve the problem for a lot longer... Right? Is it true that the head gasket wears out faster after repairing it?

 Don't invoke the holy.... Spirit....

 Lol sorry if it was too vague. Just caught my attention and I got a kick out of it.

 That escalated quickly... 




 Like what are the implications of that though? What can that do? This Atty is made of spare parts from destroyed zephyrs my friends have given me so I'm not too worried about it 




 Guys calm down. The houses are just reeeaaaallllyyyy nice

 "And that was when I quit my job" 




 Gonna be honest here, I run .04 on a 4 battery box mod in my buddha for competitions. Have been for about 3 months now. Never had a bit of trouble. 









 Know anywhere I can buy a drop bear helmet?? 
























 Alright, so is that going to require taking anything major out? 




 I was in a spot where I needed to force cold air into the engine, that's what I had to do. I didn't come here for support with my decisions, I came here for help. It's applicable to the problem so I included it. From what I've read it should cool down when I rev the engine or go around 60 if its the fan clutch right? I shouldn't have to hit 100mph to get results. I feel like it cooled down there because there was so much air going into the engine. Is there a definite way to tell if it's one or the other without tearing it apart? I live in an apartment complex that doesn't care for me disassembling my car in the parking lot lol 




 Yep. 




 I noticed they were using the "Roman candle" for their spells. It's good, but I think it's a bit reckless considering you cannot turn them off. The "flare gun" item has a lower rate of fire, but the damage is much higher. 




 Well the strength skill will be phenomenal also, but I'm not sure which career skill he'd have time for. I have heard that it's possible for a player to incorporate those skills into a career tree but it isn't easy. 




 If you aren't picky go for the machining skill tree. I've always been in it, you learn skills that can branch out into other skills like metallurgy, electrical, maintenance, and other kinds of things. Good say to grind currency too, in the US server I've averaged 16.00 an hour! 




 I had a similar experience, I was just drinking some vodka for the happiness buff and my frame rate dropped insanely low. Like we're talking black screen except for a minute every couple hours. Next thing I know I've spawned at this stone query (fortunately I didn't lose any gear) and my pre 2000 update vehicle I just grinded currency for was missing its bumper. The devs really need to work on this. 




 Yeah I heard something about the vampire boss thing, but I'm pretty sure they changed it to a hand-spear type weapon in an update following this sword. Apparently the boss was really op so they put in a stronger weapon to counter it. I'm pretty sure they removed the vampire boss completely around the time of the firearm update (at the very latest). 




 Know if they'll be restocking? 




 I gotta have that thing Lol. Does anyone know if its going to be sold separately? 




 Well, the car won't cool down until I hit over 100 so I think the fan clutch is probably okay. Is there a way to check the radiator? That is comparably easy to get out of the car if I can check that out 




 I have a 94 bmw 325i that's overheating, it seems to be leaking a small bit of oil but not too much. I think it's the water pump but that thing is an absolute nightmare to get to. Is there a way to troubleshoot it to see if that is actually the problem?

May be worth noting that the thermostat was not working but I replaced it... Still overheating though. I think maybe the overheating from the thermostat may have melted the plastic impeller on the water pump. Is there anything else I should look into in addition to that? NTB did a pressure check and said it was holding pressure, if that helps at all. 




 Think 16 gb of ram will do it? I'm in the midst of building my pc so that's all I have ATM. I plan on adding another 16 gb and a much better graphics card eventually but that's neither here nore there lol
