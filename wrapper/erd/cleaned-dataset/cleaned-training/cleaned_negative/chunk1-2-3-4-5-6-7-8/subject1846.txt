 Oh so sorry m'lady, it's not often you see a beautiful woman such as yourself on sites such as these. You must be very intellectual, are you an atheist by any chance?

 Here's the thing. You said a "black person is in prison."
Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who studies blacks, I am telling you, specifically, in Ebolatology, no one calls black people prisoners. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying "negro family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Niggerae, which includes things from niggers to negroes to lightskins.
So your reasoning for calling a black person a prisoner is because random people "call the black ones prisoners?" Let's get sandniggers and mexicans in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a nigger or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A nigger is a nigger and a member of the negro family. But that's not what you said. You said a black person is a prisoner, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the negro family niggers, which means you'd call lightskins, sandniggers, and other races prisoners, too. Which you said you don't.
It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

 I just learned of this recently in my high school history class. At the Battle of the Granicus, Alexander the Great was about to be killed by Spithridates, a satrap, from behind. As his arm was striking, Cleitus the Black severed his arm just before he could deal the finishing blow. Cleitus the Black was a commanding officer of Alexander. I did a project on the battle. It was really like out of a movie. What's ironic is, later in Alexander the Great's conquest, he killed Cleitus in a drunken quarrel.

 I am from Canada as well and I have seen commercials for the Canadian army. They were really high-quality too. 




 So let's say episodes 7-9 all turn out to be successful, what would you think about a remake of episodes 1-3 (assuming that is legally possible)? They would stick to the same storyline and plot relatively, but get rid of things that were quite obviously failures, and maybe add some new things in to make it feel like a different movie, and fix George Lucas' problems. Then these prequels would replace the old ones as canon, and the old ones could be called the "Jar Jar Trilogy" or something and will basically be referred to as Star Wars' blunder years. 

I think it could definitely work if done correctly. The prequels are actually a great story, just not told very well, in my opinion. What do you think about this? 




 Because I still haven't seen Star Wars: The Force Awakens. And yes, I'm being completely serious.

 Hello folks, I am pretty new to after effects so bear with me. 

I followed [this guy's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx0bKB9aL08) tutorial on how to make smoke in after effects, using the particle playground effect. So I got my desired smoke effect, and all is well, except for one problem. At the start of my 5 second composition, there is no smoke, but as you play the composition, the smoke emerges from the position at which I put the producer (or whatever you call the point of origin for the particles). What I want is for the smoke to already be at its maximum height at the start of the composition. I can't figure out how to do that. 

I hope you guys understand what I mean by that, and if not, I'll add screenshots from my composition. Can anyone help me out and let me know how to make it so that the smoke is already at maximum height at the start of my composition?

Thanks in advance.

 A real human bean 





























 If we are talking about opening scenes, I gotta say Inglorious Basterds. I was holding my breath with anticipation for those 15 minutes and what was on the screen was a guy drinking milk. 




 Yeah, Pratt would basically be Andy Dwyer looking for artifacts. 




 That's also one of the reasons you can't have Chris Pratt. He is Chris Pratt in every role. I agree with you on Bradley to a degree though, I just think he looks a lot like young Harrison Ford.  




 JUST DO IT! MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE! 




 Bradley Cooper looks the part. Chris Pratt has got the charisma but he's basically one big goof and I wouldn't want to see him as Indiana.  This Matthew Davis guy looks acceptable, but I don't know if he has the charisma or the star power or the acting chops. 




 Deckard being a replicant undermined the film a little as well.
 




 I just pray we don't have a complete copy of the OT with Kylo Ren being Darth Vader and Snoke being the Emperor pulling the strings from behind the scenes. It would be lazy writing. Hopefully the story is significantly different. 




 This is bullshit - you're oversimplifying a complex situation to the point of no longer adding anything useful to the discussion. 




 MAD MAX: FURY ROAD!!! 




 Making a full planet of Boba Fetts was definitely a terrible decision on George Lucas's part.  




 I just watched that film two days ago for the first time as well. Thought the bar scene and the opening scene were fantastic pieces of cinema. I couldn't really tell if the film wanted to be taken seriously or not though. 




 Just watched Ex Machina. Thought it was absolutely fantastic. Isaac and Gleeson are some of the best actors working right now, for sure.

 I suppose we all have different senses of humor here. I for one, would not laugh at someone kicking BB like a soccer ball. 

IMO the only comedic relief that should be in star wars is C3P0. 




 The whole point of the new trilogy is to tell a new story, not retread the exact same story as the OT. They might as well clone Vader, and Sheev, and then we can have the exact same original films all over again! 




 They tried slapstick comedy with Jar Jar. Look how that turned out. 




 Clone of Tarkin sounds stupid and leads me to think this is just fan fiction. 




 I hope there's no cringey "jokes". Kicking BB-8 would not be funny. 




 You'd think they learned that "funny" characters don't work with Jar Jar 




 That would be so awful. It'd be like Han Solo turning to the camera and winking. 




 When you say it will dispell many rumors, do you think it will confirm the general plot that MSW has come up with or disprove it? 




 I'm pretty sure in the upcoming Battlefront game you will be able to fly TIE fighters on Hoth.

Another question, how did they get the AT-ATs onto the ground in the first place? Just drop them from orbit? 




 I've always wanted to be a Y-wing pilot, even though everyone else would probably rather fly the X-wings. 




 Yes but Boba died (in terms of the film canon). And I wouldn't want to see him shoved in the new one just to be like "Hey guys, you love this character, here he is!" Too many old characters already. 




 The point is that Luke was swayed by the dark side, but ultimately triumphed over it and learned balance. It would be annoying to unwrite all of that for the sake of the new trilogy. 

When I said I could see it under certain circumstances, I was thinking more along the lines of he goes a little insane while in exile. I just don't think his character would be the kind of person to drop all that he's learned throughout his journey and become evil. 




 I know but seeing people well past their prime when we didn't really want to is what I'm saying.  




 Boba Fett has no place in Ep7. THAT would be lazy storytelling. I can see Luke going to the darkside under certain circumstances, despite the fact that it is a retread of Vader, and goes against his character. I'm not hoping for that though.

What I do want to see is good writing, as in dialogue that doesn't make you cringe. I also want to see some new and interesting characters, things we haven't seen before. My worry is that JJ will try too hard to focus on the OT and the past, that he won't be able to move us forward enough.

In terms of the returning cast, I really only care about Luke. Han and Leia seem like they are characters who were never meant to get old. I don't really want to see old Leia in a slave outfit or old Han struggling to catch his breath while walking.

All in all, I want to see something written well that is not too hung up on the OT. 




 Its quite likely  




 If anybody has something to discuss then make a new thread cause I'm hungry for some star wars talk. 




 No proof, but considering the amount of characters it's entirely possible. I just wanted to hear the opinions of others. 




 It's like poetry, it rhymes.  




 I dont understand this new meme 




 I assume too bloated as in too many characters, not enough time to develop them, resulting in a mess.

[Link to thread.](http://boards.4chan.org/tv/thread/58347456) It's mostly shitposting but there is a little bit of discussion.  




 I was in a SW thread on 4chan and someone said that a test cut was shown to the guys at Disney and no one really knew what to make of it because it was very bloated in terms of characters.

Now obviously we can take this with a grain of salt because there was no source or explanation, but it got me thinking that he may be right considering the amount of characters which will be featured in TFA. I would list them all but I'm sure everyone here is well aware.

So I wanted to know your thoughts on this. 




 This looks fun. Does anyone know if there will be an actual story mode? Or at least missions of Star Wars battles we already know? It seems like single-player Stormtrooper zombies could get boring. 




 I agree with this guy. Sometimes it's nice to see what other people think and speculate in this sub.
