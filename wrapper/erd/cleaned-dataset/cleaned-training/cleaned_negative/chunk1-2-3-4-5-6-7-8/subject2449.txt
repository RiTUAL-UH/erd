 It's meant to be played in the background or while your doing something (e.g playing a game) and plus there's a visualizer so I didn't really think about transitions.

 Well I'm in the UK, so it's a bit different here, all of the people in my year/grade (year 10) have to take all the sciences, maths  religious studies etc and I take an exam at the end of next year which is our 1st important exams we do here. Thanks for the nice comment :) I appreciate it :) 




 Thanks :) 

Hmm about careers idk, I'm pretty good with computers so maybe a computer related job, but I'm also quite academic so anything which interests me really (unless it's physics cause I'm terrible at that :p) 





























 Braken's new song (ID) is called Far Away. 



















 Thanks man, this helped me alot when making my lyric video :) 














 What else is a mix? Its a mix of songs -_-. If you go search EDM mix or melodic dubstep mix etc its the same as my video.
