  there isn't a separate "Conclusions" section like you are implying

You seem to have skipped the first page of the [2000 CDC report](http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/images/dogbreeds-a.pdf). The Conclusions section is on pg. 836, 1st column, 5th paragraph. The quote that ""other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates" comes from the Conclusions section on pg. 836 and not from the Discussion section on pp. 838-840. I am quoting directly from the lead sentence of the Conclusions section, so I have trouble seeing how that is a distortion of the "conclusions" from the Discussion section.

 How does that not suggest that they are more dangerous than "any other breed"?

Yes, it suggests that pit bulls can be dangerous (because they kill consistently each year). Yes, it suggests that they are more dangerous than **some** other breeds (because their fatalities are disproportionate to their breed population). No, it does not suggest that they are more dangerous than **any** other breed, which is why the conclusions of the report include that "other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates." This is clearly explained in the lead paragraph of the Discussion section:

 Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the relative dangerousness of each breed. For example, 10 fatal attacks by Breed X relative to a population of 10,000 Xs (1/1,000) implies a greater risk than 100 attacks by Breed Y relative to a population of 1,000,000 Ys (0.1/1,000). Without consideration of the population sizes, Breed Y would be perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.

I've already quoted this explanation in an earlier comment, but you seem to have trouble grasping why this definition of relative dangerousness negates your assertion (or you're willfully ignoring a basic principle of Statistics 101). So, let me put it into concrete numbers to demonstrate how it leads to the CDC's conclusion that "other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates" and contradicts your assertion that "they are more dangerous than any other breed."

* Breed X = Husky

* Breed Y = pit bull

* Breed X fatal attacks = 21 (Table 2 from CDC report)

* Breed Y fatal attacks = 76 (ibid.)

* Breed X population = 1.0% ([source](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf))  68M ([source for dog population in 2000](http://www.statista.com/statistics/198100/dogs-in-the-united-states-since-2000/)) = 0.7M

* Breed Y population = 6.7% (ibid.)  68M = 4.6M

So, the CDC's argument in concrete terms becomes the following:

 Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the relative dangerousness of each breed. For example, 21 fatal attacks by Huskies relative to a population of 0.7 million Huskies (30.0/million) implies a greater risk than 76 attacks by pit bulls relative to a population of 4.6 million pit bulls (16.5/million). Without consideration of the population sizes, pit bulls would be [incorrectly] perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.

Does this concrete example using the CDC's fatality numbers make more clear why *some* other breeds is accurate but *any* other breed is inaccurate?

 leads you to disregard the best available statistics in favor of willfully blind and frivolous pit bull advocacy

The best available statistics are those described by the CDC in the lead paragraph of their Discussion section, which leads to the lead sentence in their Conclusions section. Why do you choose to willfully ignore the best available statistics as described by the CDC and instead apply your own *ad hoc* statistics to raw data buried in the middle of the Discussion section so as to reach a conclusion that's directly contradicted by the CDC?

 You are behaving in a way that has been documented to be typical of owners of "outlaw" breeds such as Pit Bulls.

I am not an owner of a pit bull. I am an owner of an "outlaw" breed only if Dachshunds are classified as such. [Here are my reddit posts of my four wiener dogs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dachshund/search?q=author%3Atrain_subject2472 restrict_sr=on) I am a dog lover and a research scientist specializing in the area of risk assessment, so my mind is clouded with bias on this issue only in the sense that I consider myself an expert in one particular aspect.

 even worse is your post on /r/TheGentlePitbull

Please look more carefully at my comment threads about the same report that were posted on a different sub. I do not find the study compelling because breed was eliminated from the analysis due to large discordance between eye witness identifications, animal control reports, and police reports. I felt that the discordances should have been resolved (rather than thrown out) and that breed should have been included in the multivariate analysis. I emailed the principal author (Prof. Pastronek) suggesting as much and would be happy to share his responses with you by PM. 




 I never suggested that the CDC didn't find any evidence that pit bulls are dangerous. [I said](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/30xla3/if_my_son_so_much_as_cries_he_rushes_in_to_save/cpxgs58) that the CDC didn't find any "evidence that pit bulls are inherently **more** violent than any other breed" (emphasis for clarity). I don't see it as inconsistent or disingenuous to believe that pit bulls can be dangerous while also believing that they may be less dangerous than other breeds.

 it is bizarre and confusing that you are focusing on the statement that "other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates"

I'm focusing on that specific statement because it directly contradicts your ([implied](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/30xla3/if_my_son_so_much_as_cries_he_rushes_in_to_save/cpxe6xa)) assertion that the CDC report is "evidence of [pit bulls] being more inherently violent than any other breed." 

 and not statements from the same report such as:

I don't think that it's bizarre or confusing to focus on the lead sentence of the Conclusions section rather than a paragraph buried in the middle of the Discussion section. Using your example statement from the Discussion section, the CDC researchers go on to indicate that the "breed-specific problem" might not be due to inherent dangerousness but might instead be due to sex (pg. 839, 1st column, 4th paragraph), to reproductive status (ibid.), to breed popularity over time (pg. 839, 2nd column, 1st paragraph), etc. If one focuses on individual parts of the Discussion section, then it can be easy to take those parts out of context and fall prey to confirmation bias. By contrast, the Conclusions section summarizes the totality of the research, not just piecemeal parts, and is less likely to suffer from bias (imho).

 casual disregard for basic statistical analysis

What basic statistical analysis am I disregarding? It's the CDC, not me, that looked at fatality fractions and instead suggests that fatality rates are a better method to quantify relative dangerousness. It's the CDC, not me, that looked at "several interacting factors [which] affect a dogs propensity to bite." These are basic principles of statistical analysis used in risk assessment (base rates, univariate vs. multivariate models) which I appreciate that the CDC did not disregard in reaching their conclusions.

 Would you please voluntarily step down from your position?

Feel free to bring this to the attention of my fellow mods on /r/science as evidence that I should be disqualified from their ranks. I think I'd greatly enjoy defending my support of the CDC's risk assessment methodology and conclusions. Here's a link to get you started:

 You're right, the 2000 CDC report doesn't prove there is no evidence, only that one particular group of researchers didn't find any evidence 15 years ago. However, the problem is that /u/Good_timesd didn't cite the CDC in support of his argument; rather, **you** cited the CDC in support of **your** counter-argument. And that's why I'm confused. How does the CDC report constitute evidence that pit bulls are inherently more violent than any other breed when one of their conclusions is that "other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates?" 




 They reach the opposite conclusion (emphasis for clarity):

 Although fatal attacks on humans appear to be a breed-specific problem (pit bull-type dogs and Rottweilers), **other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates**.

Bite rate and fatality rate are equated with relative dangerousness by the CDC researchers on pg. 838 of the report:

 Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the relative dangerousness of each breed. For example, 10 fatal attacks by Breed X relative to a population of 10,000 Xs (1/1,000) implies a greater risk than 100 attacks by Breed Y relative to a population of 1,000,000 Ys (0.1/1,000). Without consideration of the population sizes, Breed Y would be perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.

In other words, the CDC researchers concede that pit bulls are responsible for a greater number of fatalities but indicate there is no evidence that they're responsible for a greater fatality rate, i.e., there's no evidence that they're inherently more violent. This supports /u/Good_timesd's statement that there's "no evidence of them being more inherently violent" and not your statement that it's "completely false." 




 I'm confused why you cite the [2000 CDC report](http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/images/dogbreeds-a.pdf) as evidence that pit bulls are inherently more violent than any other breed when the researchers reach the opposite conclusion. Are you sure that you didn't intend to cite a different study?

 The quote is from the 2nd paragraph of the *JAMA Pediatrics* editorial and is a summary of a CDC report from January 2015, which is Reference 1 listed at the end of the article. The quote is *not* a summary of the rest of the article, which focuses primarily on Reference 2, authored by Fontanella *et al.* and published this month. As such, the title is not an appropriate summary for the submission.

 Papers submitted to the *Journal of the BVA* might be peer-reviewed but that does not necessarily mean that they're all research papers. In the case of this submission, it's pretty clear that it's a review paper and not a research paper, in particular since it appears in the Vet Record Careers section of the journal and not in the Research section.

 The reference that you cite is from the 14th paragraph of the article and is preceded by information obtained from other sources (2008 TED talk, 2011 documentary, etc.).

 Overweight patients, with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 25, had lower mortality than normal weight patients, that is, those with BMI between 18.5 and 24.9. However, obese patients, with a BMI greater than 30, had mortality risk similar to that of normal weight patients.

  When did I say those breeds shouldn't be handled the same way?

/u/lol_wat94 asked the question: "why are we spending all this time ganging up on one?" You replied that "those 20 other breeds rarely, rarely, rarely do when compared to this one breed." The implication of your answer is that it's reasonable to gang up on pit bulls and not gang up on the 20 other breeds, i.e., that those 20 other breeds shouldn't be handled the same way as pit bulls. If that wasn't the intent of your answer, then please clarify how you feel the 20 other breeds should   shouldn't be handled the same way as pit bulls.

 But obviously, they are not the biggest problem.

How so? The data in the [Clifton report](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf) suggest otherwise.

  How is that not a problem?

When did I say it wasn't a problem? /u/lol_wut94 asked the question: "why are we spending all this time ganging up on one" when there might several other breeds (perhaps 20) that are equally or more dangerous? So far you've evaded the question rather than answering it. So if you   I agree that pit bulls are dangerous (/u/lol_wut94 might disagree), then what's your answer to their question: why do you seem to be only focusing on pit bulls? 




 While it is true that pit bulls account for the majority of dog bite-related fatalities (DBRF), that does not in itself demonstrate that they're more dangerous than the 20 other breeds mentioned by /u/lol_wut94. That's because in [risk assessment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment), relative dangerousness is objectively measured not by fatality *numbers* but instead by fatality *rates*. Here's how it's described by the CDC in their [report on DBRF](http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/images/dogbreeds-a.pdf):

 Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the **relative dangerousness of each breed**. For example, 10 fatal attacks by Breed X relative to a population of 10,000 Xs (1/1,000) implies a greater risk than 100 attacks by Breed Y relative to a population of 1,000,000 Ys (0.1/1,000). Without consideration of the population sizes, Breed Y would be perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.

When relative dangerousness is calculated in this manner, then fatalities by those 20 other breeds are not so rare when compared to pit bulls. Feel free to run the numbers yourself based on the most recent [Clifton report](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf).

 [According to the CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/images/dogbreeds-a.pdf), there are approximately 800,000 dog bites per year that require medical attention. [According to the CVMA](http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.colovma.org/resource/resmgr/CLSD_Data_Presentation_Sept2.pdf), pit bulls account for 9.35% of dog bites (as opposed to fatalities), so about 75,000. [According to Merritt Clifton](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf), pit bulls make up 6.7% of the dog population, so about 5.5 million.

800,000 dogs attack per year out of a population of 83.3 million (1.0%). 75,000 pit bulls attack per year out of a population of 5.5 million (1.4%), which means that 98.6% of pit bulls don't harm anybody. Your sources are well   good but they only show that the 1.4% of pit bulls that attack are more dangerous than the 1.0% of other breeds that attack. However, your sources don't disprove /u/Schneiderman's claim that "the majority of pit bulls do not harm anybody." 




  Even if you take the pitbull stats and cut them in half- they are still by far the most dangerous breed

You make a valid point but seem to forget that this is not statistically how relative dangerousness is calculated in risk assessment. Here's how it's explained by the CDC in their [2000 report](http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/images/dogbreeds-a.pdf) concerning dog bite-related fatalities:

 Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the relative dangerousness of each breed. For example, 10 fatal attacks by Breed X relative to a population of 10,000 Xs (1/1,000) implies a greater risk than 100 attacks by Breed Y relative to a population of 1,000,000 Ys (0.1/1,000). Without consideration of the population sizes, Breed Y would be perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.

When fatality *rates* are considered in a more statistically rigorous manner than simple fatality *numbers*, it could be argued that other breeds might be more dangerous than pit bulls (which just so happens to be the conclusion of the 2000 CDC report). 




  Total bite-related fatalities between 1979 and 1998:

I think that you mean *total dogs involved in bite-related fatalities* between 1979 and 1998. That is, it looks like you added up the 6th column in Table 2, which are the numbers of dogs, as opposed to the 3rd column in Table 2, which are the numbers of fatalities. They're not the same because sometimes multiple dogs were involved in the same fatality.

Here are the other numbers for comparison:

* Grand total (fatalities): 238
* Non-pit bull: 162
* Pit bull: 76

Top 5 as a percent of total:

1. Pit bull: 32%
2. Rottweiler: 18%
3. German Shepherd: 11%
4. Husky: 9%
5. Malamute: 6%

As an added bonus, here's how the top 5 stack up when comparing fatality rate, i.e., % fatalities divided by % population, as described in the first paragraph of the Discussion section of the CDC report:

1. Malamute: 6%  0.08% = 75.0
2. Husky: 9%  1.0% = 9.0
3. Rottweiler: 18%  2.8% = 6.4
4. Pit bull: 32%  6.7% = 4.8
5. German Shepherd: 11%  3.7% = 3.0

  What do we lose by banning dangerous breeds?

Keep in mind that the councilmen have suggested banning only pit bulls and not all dangerous breeds. It's possible that the problem is a combination of potential for injury and breed popularity, since pit bulls are the 2nd most common breed after only Labs. And according to a CDC report from 2000, Rottweilers were responsible for more injuries 20 years ago when pit bulls were less common. So, banning only pit bulls might not solve the problem if owners simply adopt other dangerous breeds instead.

  I'm not the one singling them out, they're doing that themselves.

How so? According to the [Clifton report](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf), the fatality rates for Akitas, German Shepherds, Huskies and Chows are likewise disproportionate. Citing the Wikipedia page on fatal dog attacks certainly indicates that fatalities from pit bulls are disproportionate to the breed's population but it doesn't disprove /u/nomecks's point that there are other breeds with a similar issue.

  The risk to humans during encounters with pit bulls far out-weigh their prevalence as a dog breed.  Thoughts?

The same can be said of wolf-like breeds (including German Shepherds   Huskies) and Chow-like breeds. According to your source, the fatality rate (fatality % divided by population %) is 9-to-1 for pit bull-type dogs, but it's equally disproportionate for wolf-like dogs (4-to-1) and Chow-like dogs (20-to-1). I would propose that your interesting   reasonable options should be considered for all three breed groups and not just pit bulls. Otherwise, if those options are only considered for pit bulls, then the data suggest that other potentially dangerous breed groups are being unreasonably excluded.

  we would still be left with a highly disproportionate kill-rate.

I think that you mean disproportionate kill-numbers. Because when kill-rates are calculated (as described in the 1st paragraph of the Discussion section of the 2000 CDC study), then pit bull fatalities are not disproportionate compared to other large breeds:

1. Malamute: 15 fatalities  20 years  50,000 dogs = 0.015-per-1,000

2. Husky: 21  20  680,000 = 0.0015-per-1,000

3. Rottweiler: 44  20  1.9M = 0.0012-per-1,000

4. Pit Bull: 76  20  4.6M = 0.0008-per-1,000

5. German Shepherd: 27  20  2.5M = 0.0005-per-1,000

 Sorry, no. 




 I think it's debatable whether there's been no significant rise in number of victims of mass shootings. It's a point convincingly argued by Northeastern's [James Alan Fox](http://hsx.sagepub.com/content/18/1/125.short) but also convincingly counter-argued by Harvard's [David Hemenway](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/mass-public-shootings-increasing-in-us/). I think it's more to the point that even Fox concedes that mass shootings have been a stable phenomenon for the past 20-30 years, which contradicts your implied argument that violence is on the decline (by citing gun homicide rates) and instead supports /u/djroomba__'s argument that "these killings will not stop."

Now if you want to argue against /u/djroomba__'s opinion that changes to gun laws   mental health care will reduce the frequency and number of victims of mass shootings, be my guest. Because as far as I'm aware, such conjecture is typically based on qualitative comparisons between policies in the USA vs. other countries and not on any scientific research.

  Around 60% of dog attacks in the world are pit bulls only.

Do you have a scientific source that supports this claim or are you just exaggerating? The CDC found that around 50% of fatalities (not attacks) in the USA (not the world) were by pit bulls. The CVMA found that less than 10% of dog attacks in Colorado were by pit bulls. I'm unaware of any scientific study that looked at dog attacks worldwide.

 They are banned in UK and New Zealand.

Pit bull-type dogs (as commonly understood in this thread) are not banned in the UK. Only purebred Pit Bull Terriers are banned by the [Dangerous Dogs Act 1991](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/65/contents). Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers and mixed breeds are all allowed in the UK. For example, [here is just one list of Stafforshire Bull Terriers available for sale to Londoners](http://www.pets4homes.co.uk/sale/dogs/staffordshire-bull-terrier/london/).

 It is also banned in parts of Canada, after which dog attacks dropped by 80%.

Do you have a source that supports this claim or are you just exaggerating? Because I think you might have your numbers backward. The Toronto Humane Society conducted a [study in 2013](http://www.torontohumanesociety.com/pdfs/Breed_Specific_Legislation_Jan-14.pdf) which found that "dog bite rates in 36 Canadian municipalities found no difference between jurisdictions with BSL and those without." In particular, the number of bites by pit bulls decreased by 98% after BSL was enacted in Ontario ([as reported by the *Toronto Star*](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/10/03/pit_bulls_were_torontos_biggest_biters_before_the_ban.html)) but the number of bites by all breeds remained essentially unchanged: [5,428 in 2005 to 5,345 in 2009](http://www.citynews.ca/2010/04/28/number-of-bites-largely-unchanged-after-pit-bull-ban/). The only reference I could find to an 80% reduction in dog bites was in Calgary (from 10-per-10,000 people in 1986 to 2-per-10,000 people in 2006) but Calgary employs strong licensing   enforcement and not BSL.

 But 1 in 10 will destroy someones life.

Do you have a source that supports this claim or are you just exaggerating? Because it seems like it's pulled out of thin air. [The Clifton report](http://www.dogsbite.org/dog-bite-statistics-study-dog-attacks-and-maimings-merritt-clifton.php) indicates that pit bulls are responsible for about 115 serious attacks per year and comprise about 6.7% of the dog population, so about 5.6 million. If the average pit bull lifespan is 12-14 years, then basic math tells us that 1-in-4,000 will destroy someone's life, not 1-in-10. What are the "statistics" behind this seemingly outrageous claim?
