 Don't even consider staying in the Sperdorm! Live somewhere where you can live the life, learn Turkish, etc...

If you have a decent budget (maybe up to 700 lira a month) try Cihangir, galata, etc... You can also try living  in Tarlaba for a different experience if you want full immersion  (IE living in a Kurdish\Roma ghetto).It's cheaper there and in a few other places like Kasmpaa than in the trendy neighborhoods but requires some more street smarts and Turkish skills. Student-oriented places can also be found in Bekta or, of course, near Boazii.

 Key tips from someone who has lived in Turkey...
* Do not stay in Sultanahmet, which is a giant theme park for tourists. Stay in Beyoglu. I've heard good things about the "World House" hostel and also "Neverland," which was the cheapest and attracted the most quirky and interesting guests at the time.
* the couch surfing network in Istanbul is great. Use it. At least goto a meet up  
* Your budget will be greatly reduced if you don't drink. Alcohol is heavily taxed and very expensive. 
* Immediately buy the "Istanbul Eats" book or visit their blog (same information). Use this and you won't have a bad meal. 
*Spend more time in Turkey\Istanbul than you think you'll want to. 
* From the airport you will save a lot of money if you take the "Hava" shuttle instead of a cab. Just make sure it's going to the right place (probably "Taksim")
* Goto the following neighborhoods: Taksim, Galata, Tnel, Cihangir, Balat\Fener, Kadky, Karaky, one of the islands if the weather is nice, perhaps Arnavutky or Rumeli Hsar\Saryer. 
* Save money by taking public transit. The bus system is great as are the trams, metro, ferries. The *Dolmu*es, a kind of shared taxi, will especially save you money and time
* Bargain 
* Try to go elsewhere in Turkey... Kapadokya. The Coast. If you are really intrepid and adventurous perhaps the South East. Skip Ankara.

 The best I've ever gotten was when I was stuck in traffic on the Bklyn bridge. The cabby looked into the mirror towards me and squinted. He said "You are Jewish... yes?" Trapped in the moment, I wasn't sure how to proceed but I decided it was best to be truthful and after a moment I replied, "Yes..." There was a long pause.

Finally, he looks back into the mirror and simply declares. "At home we fight, but here we are friends. We have the same food."  




 I would do this:



These could be in any order:
1 day devoted to the museums others have mentioned and central park.

1 day starting in Union square, walking down through the west village, crossing over to the east village and then perhaps down further through soho for dinner in chinatown. You could also do that all, get a late lunch in chinatown and then continue across the brooklyn bridge and see dumbo, bkyn bridge park, brooklyn heights and get dinner around there. There's great middle eastern food that's cheap on atlantic ave. and many other options on smith st. 

You could easily split the above day into two and make that the third day. Instead of wasting your time in the tourist wasteland that is timesquare, what about finding a theater experience more true to downtown NYC? Check out the Saint Ann's Warehouse in dumbo (you could walk there over the Manhattan bridge from china town after your lunch!) Look in the village voice or timeoutNY for listings. Or sleep no more. Or The Flea Theater. 

  




 Does anyone know if the typical delivery man in NYC actually receives a tip if you list one on seamless? I usually hold off and tip cash because I'm not sure...

  As for spices I think you would be fine if you just goto to the store and buy the following:

* Cumin
* Paprika
* Cayenne
* Cinnamon 
* Nutmeg
* dried mint
* oregano
* Bay Leaves
* thyme \ Rosemary 
* tumeric 

Perhaps also:
* Coriander
* Cardamom
* Saffron
* fennel seeds
* mustard seeds
* Cloves
 
I hate buying spices in America because you can't try them first. As far as I'm concerned they're all terrible so it doesn't make a difference if you get them from one place or another.

 Hi!

I'm making a minced mushroom filling for Iranian "sambusas" kinda like baked samosas. I'm wondering if I should sear the mushrooms whole first or if I can mince them first raw and then cook.

What I did this time:
Minced shallots   browned in butter\oliveoil 
Minced 'shrooms and added to the pan and seasoned 
I was also going to add walnuts but forgot! (woops...)

 Sound designer\accordionist here. Feedback suppressors, if you're *very* lucky address the symptom but not the overall problem. When you get to the venue you need to consider your placement in relation the speakers. Are you playing in front of the speakers? This will create feedback in nearly any system. Perhaps you're mics are gained to high. If you address these two things and it's still a problem, then you can look into some EQ - For this individually raise each band until you find the one that corresponds with the root frequency of the feedback. What band enduces feedback. Once you find it, you can bring it back until the feedback is reduced. It's much better to manually counteract it like this than to use a feedback suppressor in attempt to address it automatically (which probably won't work). I've never met a sound professional  who uses one of these devices.

 Long story short i had a FOs install apt today and mobilyan showed up. After 7 hours of calling customer support I finally reach the executive support line where I'm told that fios isn't available in my building dispite prior notices of availability. 

Later I get a call from the guy in the truck who tells me he actually came but the neighboring landlord refused to give permission to run the line past his building! I went to the restarant downstairs in the building next door where they refused to give me their LLord's contact info and mentioned that I'm not the first person to complain. I did some detective work and found the guy's address and associated phone number. I tried calling but nobody picked up.

The girl said "I too so much E and now I can't remember my room number." Then she asked the older man "are you rolling?!" and he said "Have you every heard of Jesus Christ?"

 * Paring knife should def be on the essential list. 
* You don't need a million pans. I'd say one large frying pan, a smaller cast iron skillet, stock pot, medium sauce pan, and an enameled dutch oven will get you VERY FAR. 
* The one thing you're missing is a lot of small assorted containers\bowls\dishes for  mise en place 
* i'd also add a palate knife (like what painters use for spackle) for scraping things around 




 First by watching mom. Then in college I got to practice when the meal plan sucked and I just craved Turkish food! I made friends with the cafeteria workers and they would give me ingredients from the store room :-) I learned to cook non-Turkish food when I then lived in Turkey and craved thai food and more :-p 




 I agree with ostones and would add to always focus on making your left hand more stacatto for clarity. Also try playing repeated notes in the melody with different fingers on each one. It's a good habit to get into now for when you start playing super fast later. A great exercise is playing triplets on one note 321 321 321 321 or 123 451 234 512 345

 As others have said it's a mix. What's in it is up to you but I'd say cumin is generally dominant. When I make lamb kfte \ merguez I use:

* 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1 1/4 teaspoons ground coriander (toasted)
* 1/2    teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 1/4 teaspoons fennel seeds (toasted)
* 2 tablespoons harissa or ac biber salas

 Sorry I misspoke, I was referring to a putty knife not an offset spatula. Great for omelets, anything on a skillet, cleaning your cutting  board.

 Two ways I like:

* Cut in half, where the pit was drizzle some nice olive oil and handsomely season with S\P.

* When I have a little more time, I love to caramelize some shallots with cumin, paprika, lime juice. Throw in some almonds at the end. Put it in a bowl, and make some toast in the same pan. Then I take an avocado, mush it up, add salt, pepper, olive oil and a little bit of balsamic or rice-wine vinegar. Spread that on the toast, and add the shallot\almond on top.  




 Inclusion or exclusion: Perhaps a normally loud atmosphere grows suspiciously quiet. Or maybe some element of the atmosphere starts in a rhythmic fashion, like water dripping or a rusty fan.Or maybe it's nature and the animals that inhabit the enviornment start making alarm sounds.  




 Think of not only where you are, but what's beyond the walls of the scene. 

* What time is it? 
* What season?
* Is it tense? 
* for your restaurant is it fancy, is there also a bar? where is the kitchen?
* How does the environment react to what's goin' on?

If it's a tense winter night, chances are there aren't going to be crickets in the background or children going to school for instance.

 Hi All!

I'm having a Sambusah party in 2 days (Iranian pastry empanadas). I've made them before but need advice on making A LOT in the most efficient way possible. This is for around 20-30 people so figure I'm making around 100-150 total sambusahs. 

I plan on making my 5 fillings on day #1.

Day 2 will be all about stuffing and folding them. Then baking some and frying some so that they'll be fresh when people start arriving in the evening. I have 2 questions:

* What is the most **efficient way to prep** so that I can do as much ahead of time but keep them fresh. Can I stuff some day-1 and refrigerate, or will they got soggy? Maybe freeze the ones I'm frying?

* **Folding** them can be a time consuming process. Any tips to speed it up?

*  I was also considering other forms some could take, like an **open cup**. Any tips on how to make puff pastry mini cups? Could I make these day 1 and then fill them right before? Should they be refrigerated or room temp? 




 nope... it actually seems like a marketing stunt for ABC to promote it's new show  




 on new years day there's the "polar bear swim" there which is probably pretty fun to check out 




 Yeah they're great! If you like them make sure you check out the [Golden Festival](www.goldenfest.org).  




 Native Brooklynite here. Use [HopStop](http://www.hopstop.com) to figure out trains once you know your destination. 

I would suggest either walking across the Brooklyn bridge to DUMBO or you could take the F to York or the A\C to High St. Walk around [Dumbo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DUMBO) and then go up the hill (or squibb bridge) to [Brooklyn Heights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Heights) to see some really nice tree lined brownstoney streets and the [Promenade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Heights_Promenade). 

Some alternatives: Walk the length of **5th Ave in Park Slope.** You could either take any train to Barclay's Center or 2/3 to Bergen.  Cool things to check out there:

* [BierKraft](http://www.bierkraft.com/)

* [Skyice](http://www.yelp.com/biz/skyice-sweet-and-savory-brooklyn) good Thai food that's a bit better than standard fare. Casual. Really interesting icecream flavors

* [Gorilla Coffee](http://gorillacoffee.com/) Strong Stuff!

* [Barbs](http://www.barbesbrooklyn.com) Amazing music every night of the year. 

* etc...  

Or take the B\Q all the way out to **Brighton Beach.** Get lunch at [Cafe Kashkar](http://kashkarcafe.com/) or one of the [Russian places](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Brighton+Beach+Russian+Restaurants find_loc=Brooklyn%2C+NY)  and then walk down the boardwalk to Coney Island which is erie but kinda cool in the winter. Good if you're adventurous and like Russian stuff. 

Don't goto Williamsburg. It's just an extension of Manhattan and full of people trying too hard to act like what they think of as "real New Yorkers"    




 I spent some time this summer interpreting from my non-native second language (Turkish) into English for some friends I was traveling with. When I was in the thick of it, doing it daily, I started dreaming in both simultaneously. It was as if I was interpreting the dialog in my dreams as it occurred.  




 Yeah you're right. I had the impression that she wanted to explore authentic East New York to see "what the city is really about..." 




 * **The Staten Island Ferry** You don't need tickets, don't worry about it. 

* **Ground Zero** No idea, but I'm sure you can just show up. 

* **City pass....** I'm a native New Yorker and never heard of this. The MET is free and you can give them whatever you want at entry so a "discount" seems silly.  

* **Subway** Get a weekly pass. That makes sense since you'll be jetting around all week. Every station has a machine where you can get one. 

* **Tickets** Goto TKTS. Like u/SilverMarch said the one in Downtown Brooklyn is the easiest. From there you can easily walk and see the Brooklyn Heights promenade\DUMBO\Brooklyn Bridge


* **Central Park** Like anywhere in New York, **the best thing you can do is just walk around, get lost and find your own little surprises**. The horses are pricy but easy to find. 

* **Bus Tour** No clue. Be a real New Yorker and walk! 

* **The Projects** Don't be an idiot.  




 Folks have already suggested Kalustiyans and Sahadi's as I was. I'd also add Patel Brothers in Jackson Heights to the list for anything indian. Go there to be inspired: there will be plenty of stuff you don't even recognize.  




 Also check the places across the street from Sahadi's or Damascus next door for middle eastern goods.  




 It is become even less sparsely populated to due to migration after the late 80's onwards. People in the East came to the Istanbul \ the cities seeking work and refuge from armed conflict between the state and the PKK.

[FB Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1463670323866314/)

Join Tipsy Oxcart for a night of funky Mediterranean madness at Radio Bean. All the way from Brooklyn, Tipsy Oxcart plays electric, sweaty, bumpin' Balkan music, channeling the spirit of 36 hour weddings to keep the crowds dancing until the sun comes up. Serving up originals and fresh, upbeat arrangements of urban dance tunes, the band deviously infuses the sounds of South-Eastern Europe with elements of jazz, funk, and more. Dig naughty violin solos, atomic accordion grooves, freak-me-out clarinet, and the baddest rhythm section this side of the Mediterranean. A party with Tipsy Oxcart is guaranteed to shake the dance floor all night long!

 I'm in NYC 




 Thanks for your help! It's a doc so there isn't really much subby material so I think I'm probably fine in that dept unless I'm overlooking something? Theater speakers are full range and the LFE is literally for LFE(?) Is there crossover that I'm overlooking and need to account for?   




 Room isn't treated but I have a pretty good understanding of its deficiencies. Mixing LCR so 5.1 minus 2.1...  




 Hi Folks,

I'm mixing a film that got picked up for a festival. My small room is loosely calibrated to -79dB on my nearfields. When I print the stems I want to make sure this thing is going to translate decently to the theater. Are there any steps I can take from my room to make absolutely sure there aren't any surprises when it gets to the theater?  




 I've rarely had a problem with my big guerrini which I know fits perfectly in the overhead of a large transatlantic flight. That said I know professionals who will actually take the instrument apart into its two halves and have separate cases for each.

 Fish sauce and shallots. 




 np- still learning the basics myself. 
If you can't find kafir lime, you can dilute normal lime juice with a little mayer lemon. 




 You want the little fresh or pickled "bird's eye" peppers used in Thai and Indian food for CHILLI PASTE.

 However what you are making is CURRY paste, which is different. For that you're best bet is **dried** puya peppers. You mash them up in a mortar and pestle with all the other stuff. Some trouble-shooting tips for 'ya are: 

* When making your curry, first sautee the paste alone in oil for a bit until fragrant to cook all the raw shallots/garlic/other stuff. 

* You are correct to add sugar. Best bet is to dilute **palm sugar** (not white granulated cane sugar) in a mixture or lime juice and fish sauce. Then add that to the pot to incorporate it into the paste.  Add coconut milk after. 

* The boxed coconut milk is better than the canned. 
* finish it all off with some unsweetened coconut cream once your protein is cooked (not cream of coconut or creamed coconut). 
*I've never used it since my city has access to thai stuff, but you could try http://www.templeofthai.com/ for ingredients. I'm guessing you may have also been missing galangal and lime leaves too which makes a world of difference.   









 I do it all the time for live theater, and have never had a problem with hair noise. I usually use 2 toupee clips, hiding the cable under a part of hair, securing a loop of cable to the back of the neck with skinprep+transpore. The mic sits centrally right at the hairline, best situation are bangs to hide it. You can match the cable color to the hair with shoe paint, just be sure to cover the element with a little e-tape first so you don't mess it up. You can color the element itself with a paint marker.  




 Mic + pot of hot oil + something frying in it.  









 There are a bunch of video on youtube of how to do it. I just seasoned mine yesterday and it worked fine:

 Basically, scrubbed the waxy stuff out of it with warm water, detergent, and a scouring pad. Then I heated it up on my range  REALLY HOT. Next rubbed oil all around in it. Then burned that in occasionally rotating it around to hit as much of the surface as I could- you're going for a smooth burnt black finish on the inside. 

 I've heard of an alternate method using salt to get the same effect but I don't know much about it.  




 Could it be some kind of metadata or a copyright marking trick? 




 actually paying far under the stabilized rate 




 According to NYC housing code my landlord is legally obligated to renew my lease after it expires. He also never disclosed that the apt. is rent stabilized and I found it out later (illegal although I don't really care). Should I continue to bug him to formally renew it, or in the eyes of the law am I safe and still covered. (see below) 

The catch: My lease has a clause that it's good for a year (which has passed) and "thereafter it shall become a month-to-month tenancy."

Later it says, "TERMINATION: After expiration of the leasing period, this agreement is automatically renewed from month to month, but may be terminated by either party giving the other a 30-day written notice of intention to terminate. Where laws require "just cause," such just cause shall be so stated on said notice..."  

Am I safe from sudden eviction or is he legally permitted to kick me out after a months notice? (a bad situation to be be in) 




 CHEESE!
