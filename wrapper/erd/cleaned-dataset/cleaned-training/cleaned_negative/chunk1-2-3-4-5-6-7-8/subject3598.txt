 a greatly under-played but key part of the Glorious Revolution was the Mutiny Act of 1689.

This Act was passed in 1689 in response to the mutiny of a large portion of the army which stayed loyal to James II.

The 1689 Bill of Rights also prohibited a standing army in peacetime without the consent of Parliament.

A new Mutiny Act was passed each year until 1879.

 The crown had its own revenues too. The navy could fund itself through prize money from captured ships. 

Doug allen wrote on this.

There was a traditional crown revenue called ship money.

The crown needed money from parliament to fund a standing army. 




 Japan was against Germany in world war 1.

the Japanese-Russian non-aggression pact did not help Germany either.

a complicated relationship indeed between the Nazis and Japan.

why Hitler declared war on america has not been well-explained. 




 I should add that making the mutiny act expire annually was one of the ways parliament forced the crown to call annual sessions of parliament. 




 I agree. more of an accident.

the navy was created under the royal prerogative

a standing army was tightly controlled because of its importance to power struggles in the middle ages

 Fama's views did learn with his research and incorporated it into his investment company. smart man and very rich as are his top students.

 I'm a big fan of Fama's work on anomalies. They certainly have played a role in the development and establishment of neoclassical ideas about financial econ. I was nearly involved in quite similar research on bond markets. 

**BUT**

With that said, his ideas are in competition with other ideas about movements of asset values, which are also considered "mainstream" these days. 

Behavioral econ, for instance, which discards the idea of "homo-economicus".

 "the man is arguing that concentration of the world's wealth into the hands of a small couple of people is a bad idea from an economic perspective."

No he is not. Krugman is moralising about distributive justice.

John Rawls is often put forward as the starting point for political philosophy of political progressives. Rawls was interested in the implications of different social institutions for his conception of justice as fairness.

Rawls pointed out that behind the veil of ignorance, people will agree to inequality as long as it is to everyones advantage. Rawls was awake to the power of incentives.

Rawls lent qualified support to the idea of a flat-rate consumption tax (see A Theory of Justice pp. 278-79). He said a proportional expenditure tax may be part of the best scheme and adding that such a tax can contain all the usual exemptions. 

The reason why Rawls lent qualified support to the idea of a flat-rate consumption tax was these taxes what people take out of the common store of goods rather than what he or she contributes.

Incomes tax must be opposed on social justice grounds, but not progressive consumption taxes. 

Given that the super-rich top 0.1% do not spend much of their incomes, they are grossly over-taxed relative to what they take out of the common store of goods.!

He preferred progressive consumption taxes, according to Rawls, it imposes a levy according to how much a person takes out of the common store of goods and not according to how much he contributes. 

A simple way to have a progressive consumption tax is to exempt all savings from taxation. A taxable consumption is calculated as income minus savings minus a large standard deduction.

With his emphasis on fair distribution through state initiatives, Rawlss initial appeal is mainly to the left, but left-wing thinkers also found his acceptance of capitalism reactionary and his tolerance of social discrepancies unpalatable. 




 Alchian (1969) lists three ways to adjust to unanticipated demand fluctuations:
	output adjustments;
	wage and price adjustments; and
	Inventories and queues (including reservations).

Alchian (1969) suggests that there is no reason for wage and price changes to be used regardless of the relative cost of these other options:
	The cost of output adjustment stems from the fact that marginal costs rise with output;
	The cost of price adjustment arises because uncertain prices and wages induce costly search by buyers and sellers seeking the best offer; and
	The third method of adjustment has holding and queuing costs.

There is a tendency for unpredicted price and wage changes to induce costly additional search. Long-term contracts including implicit contracts arise to share risks and curb opportunism over sunken investments in relationship-specific capital.

These factors lead to queues, unemployment, spare capacity, layoffs, shortages, inventories and non-price rationing in conjunction with wage stability.

Alchian and Woodwards 1987 Reflections on a theory of the firm says:

 the notion of a quickly equilibrating market price is baffling save in a very few markets.

Imagine an employer and an employee. Will they renegotiate price every hour, or with every perceived change in circumstances? If the employee is a waiter in a restaurant, would the waiters wage be renegotiated with every new customer? Would it be renegotiated to zero when no customers are present, and then back to a high level that would extract the entire customer value when a queue appears?

 But what is the right interval for renegotiation or change in price? The usual answer as soon as demand or supply changes is uninformative.

Alchian and Woodward then go on to a long discussion of the role of protecting composite quasi-rents from dependent resources as the decider of the timing of wage and price revisions.

Alchian and Woodward explain unemployment as a side-effect of the purpose of wage and price rigidity, which is the prevention of hold-ups over dependent assets.

They note that unemployment cannot be understood until an adequate theory of the firm explains the type of contracts the members of a firm make with one another.

Benjamin Kleins theory of rigid wages in American Economic Review in 1984 is one of the few that explored rigid wages as an industrial organisation issue. Klein treated rigid wages as a response to opportunism and hold-up problems over specialised assets and are forms of exclusive dealership or take-or-pay contracts.

 For links discussing the quality of the analysis of Leigh and Gans, see http://offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.co.nz/2009/09 




 I agree. see Steven Kaplan and Joshua Rauhs Its the Market: The Broad-Based Rise in the Return to Top Talent Journal of Economic Perspectives 2013 who found that:
 Rising inequality is due to technical changes that allow highly talented individuals or superstars to manage or perform on a much larger scale.

 These superstars can now apply their talents to greater pools of resources and reach larger numbers of people and markets at home and abroad. They thus became more productive, and higher paid.

 Those in the Forbes 400 richest are less likely to have inherited their wealth or grown-up wealthy.
 Todays rich are working rich who accessed education while young and then applied their natural talents and acquired skills to the most scalable industries such as ICT, finance, entertainment, sport and mass retailing.

 The U.S. evidence on income and wealth shares for the top 1% is most consistent with a superstar explanation. This U.S. evidence is less consistent with the gains in earnings of the top 1 percent coming from greater managerial power over the determination of their own pay in the corporate world or changes in social norms about what managers could earn.

Todays super-rich are highly productive because they produce new and better products and services that people want and are willing to pay for.

These rewards for entrepreneurship and hard work guide people of different talents and skills into the occupations and industries where their talents produce the most. The efficient allocation of talent and income maximising occupational choices were important to Rawls framework.

-	After 2000, the Austrian school can still all fit into one room and most would still know each other from the same one or two graduate schools. Most would be recent graduates of George Mason University.

 see also Taxation and Market Work: Is Scandinavia an Outlier?
Richard Rogerson at http://www.nber.org/papers/w12890

Abstract: 

This paper argues that it is essential to explicitly consider how the government spends tax revenues when assessing the effects of tax rates on aggregate hours of market work. 

Different forms of government spending imply different elasticities of hours of work with regard to tax rates. 

I illustrate the empirical importance of this point by addressing the issue of hours worked and tax rates in three sets of economies: the US, Continental Europe and Scandinavia. 

While tax rates are highest in Scandinavia, hours worked in Scandinavia are significantly higher than they are in Continental Europe. 

I argue that differences in the form of government spending can potentially account for this pattern.

 Abstract:
To generate big responses of unemployment to productivity shocks in a business cycle context or to productivity changes in a welfare state context, researchers have reconfigured matching models in various ways, e.g., by elevating the utility of leisure, by making wages sticky, by assuming alternating-offer wage bargaining, by introducing fixed matching costs, by modelling costly acquisition of credit, or by positing government mandated unemployment benefits, layoff costs, and taxes. 

All of these redesigned matching models increase responses of unemployment to movements in productivity through a common intermediating channel that we call the fundamental surplus fraction.


The fundamental surplus fraction is an upper bound on the fraction of a jobs output that the invisible hand can allocate to vacancy creation. All such models generate larger unemployment responses to movements in productivity by making the fundamental surplus fraction smaller.

Abstract:      
Until the 1970s, Hong Kong's Government collected as few statistics as possible, a policy only partially explained by its commitment to laisser faire. Statistics were seen as threatening its freedom from London's control and its ability to limit political debate locally. Using unpublished material from the Hong Kong Public Records Office, this paper reviews statistical issues of major importance in Hong Kong's transition to an industrial economy and its emergence as a financial centre. It demonstrates how the quality of statistics affected the management of financial markets and banking crises, and identifies the wider costs of the shortage of comprehensive statistics. 




 It would be a lot easier to just increase the earned income tax credit? 




 data is as a percentage of the average wage of a full-time worker 




 Most are those who support the minimum wage shift gears their applied welfare economics in all other social context to emphasise how the losers should be given priority and greater weight when adding up the social gains and social losses of economic change.

The social cost of the minimum wage is not discussed in this way: how many jobs are lost and that these job losses are much more important than any gains to society. All that is done is the number of jobs lost is compared with some other social metrics such as how much the wages go up for those that still have a job and that is enough to conclude that there is a socially beneficial change from a minimum wage increase.

Any low paid workers affected by the minimum wage increase are just reduced to numbers and added and subtracted with great ease and few moral compunctions about interpersonal comparisons of utility

A minimum wage increase is not free if one worker loses their job. The Paretian Criterion states that welfare is said to increase or decrease if at least one person is made better off or worse off with no change in the positions of others. 




 So minimum wage still disemploys. Editorial asks if that is a pareto improvement

Abstract
This study investigates the impact of ending the military draft on voter turnout in the U.S. The main study period runs from 1948 through 2006. After controlling for the unemployment rate, the degree of labor force unionization, the U.S.-Iraq War, the impact of voting in presidential elections, the female labor force participation rate, the percent of the adult population with a college degree, income, and a variable to reflect strong approval or disapproval of the U.S. President, compelling empirical evidence is found that ending the military draft in the U.S. acted to significantly reduce the aggregate voter participation rate.

 from abstract: The top 1 percent of households hold over a third of the country's total wealth, while the bottom two quintiles hold a fraction of that wealth. 

As such, the rich are able to develop and maintain highly diversified portfolios of investments, including stocks, bonds, derivatives, insurance, precious metals, degrees, multiple homes and other real estate holdings. 

The ability of the rich to safely diversity their portfolios allows them to take on riskier investments without incurring the hazards associated with the far less diverse portfolios of lower income individuals.

 I am talking about implementing a minimum wage for each different market 




 There is a vast difference between unsubstantiated and drawing on a literature whose results are mixed or open to different interpretations. 




 It took it time to concede that point.

The economics of the minimum wage is a curious area of public debate.

People are very much anti-economics, but as soon as an argument comes up that vaguely supports the minimum wage not harming unemployment, they become extremely knowledgeable of that entire literature in all its nuances.

We are now discussing whether on the best possible interpretation of the employment effects of the minimum wage been minimal whether a minimum wage increase can actually implemented without harming employment. 

The answer to that question is no. 

Much easier to just increase the earned income tax credit. 




 Remember Stigler's 1946 paper that showed that increasing the minimum wage on the assumption of monopsony power requires a separate minimum wage for every different market. 




 Is an increase in the minimum wage a pareto improvement?

 Noah Smith is full of it. Economics was never a priesthood of free markets.

Milton Friedman was a wild man in the wings until late in his life. Hayek had trouble getting up a job after about 1950.

If you mentioned Milton Friedman in a job interview before about 1995 or thereabouts, that was very career limiting. If you mentioned Hayek's name at a job interview and there was any sign of name recognition, that was evidence that you would been interviewed by well-read people.

A great many economists started out as socialists. There was great resistance to public choice within the profession and it is still is not well recognised in basic textbooks.

As correctly cited in the article the average economist is a moderate Democrat. That is a shift to the right, not to the left.

Economists are more likely to vote Democratic than Republican by a margin of 5 to 2; and even the Republican-voting economists tended to favour a lot of government intervention.

As for the Austrian School, that was so small until the late 1990s that they wouldn't need to book ahead for the table at a restaurant.

Before immunization in the United States between three and four million cases occurred a year. Most of those who are infected and who die are less than five years old. Adults have little or no memory of before the age of 4.

The risk of death among those infected is usually 0.2%. Complications are usually more severe in adults who catch the virus.

 Thanks, the law and economics of criminal justice does not seem to be as accepted as widely as I thought.

Some of the first articles in law and economics by Richard Posner and William Landes were on the economics of the courts, legal administration and the judiciary as a whole.

When Gary Becker wrote the economics of discrimination, many simply did not accept that it was a topic for economic analysis. Likewise, when he wrote Human Capital in 1964, he later explained that is book had such a long subtitle to overcome criticism of describing people as capital. 




 Shouting at people and telling them that their stupid and corrupt and on the take is rarely as a successful strategy for any salesman who has to earn his salary by selling something to them.

 correct. A big policy dilemma when setting in income thresholds for means testing the incomes of welfare beneficiaries is you can make the welfare benefit pay.

In New Zealand, you can earn $200 a week without losing any of your welfare benefits. That makes part-time work plus a single parent welfare benefit a viable investment.

There is an argument that welfare benefits should rebate dollar for dollar on any income earned to ensure that the gap between working and not working is large and the rewards are to work full time, rather than work part time and staying on the benefit, including its various second-tier benefits related to health costs and emergency grants.

 Spontaneous murders are called manslaughter where I live, because they're not premeditated. 

As for crime related murders, the large fall in crime rates in recent times as discussed well in the writings of Steve Levitt. He points out that executions are simply too infrequent to figure in criminal calculations regarding risks.

Furthermore, gang bangers, a spell on death row probably extends life expectancy relative to been murdered by business associate in a drug dispute.

 The story about the unqualified main coach for Real Madrid B Team is absolute magic 




 This review, and his review in the Journal of political economy are to of best book reviews I have ever read.

Praising what can be praised, and giving excellent criticisms of what he disagreed with. 

Straighter shooting book reviews, you will not find 




 so if you were managing these facilitators, what performance targets would you set. would take-up rates be included? 

Would you happily employ a facilitator were never persuaded anyone to come to one of these conferences? How would you know they were doing their job if you didn't expect them to deliver anyone to these conferences? 




 But that's what happens. 

Ministry of Justice facilitators have performance agreements and performance targets and among those targets is making sure people show up at restorative Justice conferences. I will know for sure when my official information act request is answered.

You wouldn't last long as restorative justice facilitator if you simply accepted no as an answer to a suggestion to attend at restorative justice conference and ended the call. 

 




 So you want to use victims of crime as unpaid social workers subtly pressured as a friend was by these facilitators to do unpaid social work with criminals. Deterrence of crime is the function of the legal system.

About 2500 of these conferences occur each year which is a small percentage of convictions. 




 How much has the IPCC estimated global warming to reduce GDP? 




 I do not give a toss about the offender. The victim owes them nothing.  




 Does the sentence increase as a result of the restorative justice conference? 

 




 Well if they want to meet with the convicted offender, they are free to contact the police or the court to arrange to do so.

The Ministry of Justice should never contact the victims  that is re-victimisation. 

Enough people complain about the trauma of having to testify in court and be cross examined. Once that is over, the victim should be free to get on with their life and never hear from the court again once they have completed their testimony. after giving their testimony, it is for the victim to decide whether to have further contact with the criminal justice system.

Why is the sentencing deferred pending a restorative justice conference?

If the offender who pled guilty is genuinely remorseful, that remorse will not be contingent on a reduction in sentence because he or she attended a restorative justice conference?

 




 Google Robert Hare: he's the world expert on the psychology of psychopaths. He agrees with you completely. 




 judges are now forced to adjourn all cases after a guilty plea to give Ministry of Justice conference facilitators time to coax offenders and victims to come together. 

I can think of plenty of cases, including the two examples given in the article, with the victim would never want to see or hear of their attacker ever again except that there been sentenced to an appropriate term prison.

People complain about giving evidence in court been a traumatic experience. Imagine having to meet with the offender again so they can pretend to be remorseful. 




 A great summary of everything you wanted to know, but was afraid to ask about Saudi Arabia. Very penetrating questions and good answers.

 Once again from the pew research Centre, everything you wanted to discuss about political polarisation but needed data. You now have it. 




 We don't object paying more for a meal at a restaurant at dinner time rather than as lunchtime; the people object to paying more for the taxi late at night where the driver must risk the dangers of night-time work on their own! 




 Is surge pricing another name for over time and night and weekend pay?

Union contracts provide for overtime pay, if you work more than the specified 8 hours a day.

Union contracts also provide that if you work at the weekends you are paid at 150% of the normal rate; and double party on public holidays.

Seems like the travelling public don't like what they's will was very good in union contracts if they were a union member. 




 You can't let facts bugger a good story story.

 I have not seen these 1942 reports with newspaper headlines in London before 




 "This paper provides a relatively non-technical survey of theoretical research on the eect of sovereign risk on the market for sovereign debt, with an emphasis on the way sovereign risk constrains the
process of globalization. 

After summarizing the legal environment governing sovereign debt, it discusses the forces that encourage repayment of sovereign debt when legal enforcement is ineffective.  It then reviews the recent literature that examines the quantitative importance of these forces. 

It concludes by discussing a range of institutional changes and policy reforms that might act to further reduce the level of sovereign risk and hence strengthen the process of globalization."

 That slippery slope argument was a favourite of the reactionary right 




 Their ability to believe it all stone cold sober worries me more 




 "Since 1 January 2002, the Tribunal has had the power to declare acts or omissions of:

the legislative, executive or judicial branches of government, or
a person or body that performs any public function, power or duty to be inconsistent with the right to freedom from discrimination, as affirmed by s.19 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.
An act or omission will not be inconsistent with those rights if it's shown to be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society."

That declaration of the human rights Tribunal plus 61 Votes on the floor of Parliament on an amending bill will get you somewhere

 "All that a court of justice can look to is the parliamentary roll: they see that an Act has passed both Houses of Parliament, and that it has received the royal assent, and no court of justice can inquire into the manner in which it was introduced into Parliament, what was done previously to its being introduced, or what passed in Parliament during the various stages of its progress through both Houses of Parliament."

per Edinburgh   Dalkeith Railway Co v Wauchope (1842) 




 When was the last time a New Zealand Act of Parliament was declared invalid by a court? 




 The constitutional position in New Zealand [...] is clear and unambiguous. Parliament is supreme and the function of the courts is to interpret the law as laid down by Parliament. The courts do not have a power to consider the validity of properly enacted laws

per Rothmans of Pall Mall (NZ) Ltd v A-G [1991] 2 NZLR 323 at 330 (HC) 




 The previous posts do not discuss the arguments submitted to the court as the case unfolded over the course of the day 




 Why is it going to take a three day High Court hearing to establish that Parliament is sovereign and therefore can make or unmake any law whatsoever.

This isn't a matter of statutory interpretation of ambiguous text. 

A specific bill was passed for the sole purpose of stripping sentenced prisoners of their voting rights as one of the consequences of being convicted of a serious crime. 




 The customer is always right. 




 Essay arguing that the Greens are no more than a reincarnation of the 19th century British Tory Radicals with their aristocratic sensibilities that combined strong support for centralised power with a paternalistic concern for the plight of the poor 




 Many a war criminal would go free without the ability to criminalise organisations.

"Joint criminal enterprise" ("JCE") is a mode of liability created by judges on the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia that allows the tribunal to bring charges against members of a group responsible for war crimes or crime against humanity even if there is no evidence that the particular individuals physically participated in the crimes.

Germany prescribed a successor to the Nazi party when it started winning seats in the State and Federal parliaments. 

This party was led by the SS major who was at the centre of the coup attempt in 1944  initially he was ordered to arrest all the Nazi leaders; then Hitler got on the phone to him and he arrested the coup leaders. He was an unrepentant Nazi.


 




 This is a great interview where Samuelson reflects on the state and evolution of modern economics with great impartiality 




 Nice discussion of junk science intruding into legal procedure. Some really crazy theories tend to get believed these days.

Indeed, forensics scientist have to counter the CSI effect: they have to testify before the jury to show that there are a number of things forensic science cannot prove contrary to what you saw on TV 




 I could not agree more. 

I don't know how the media takes seriously after been so wrong so many times but as Richard Posner said in his book, public intellectuals, the media standard for public intellectuals is pretty low. 




 To undo election, disputed votes must exceed winning margin, of 18000

 Sadly, most people would dance on the grave of your admitted error and use it to totally discredit you.

Politicians never admit error because it will be used again and again against them in the future. Oddly enough, in politics, admitting error is a sign of weakness. 




 One of the purposes of John Rawls' veil of ignorance and Buchanan and Tullock's veil of  uncertainty is that the basic social institutions be designed when we have abstracted from the grubby particulars of our own self-interest.

Behind the veil of ignorance and the veil of uncertainty, we would all agree that resources are limited, including in the health sector and some drugs can't be funded  choices must be made.

Once we go in front of the veil of ignorance and find out that we are the one missing out on that drug, naturally, our views will change.

Is always the case that someone just falls on the other side of any line in the sand. If you move that line, there is always another set of people who are just on the other side. 




 I have updated my post and discussed how your response is straight out of Yes Minister. I also repositioned my comments as replies to you so that the thread makes more sense 




 When a scientist makes an error, he admits it. That is what Richard Tol did.

Do have a problem with scientists admitting that they make errors? Do you praise them, or criticise them for their scientific honesty? 




 I notice you do what bureaucrats to an focus on error rather than the main thrust of an argument.
You completely ignore this part of what I posted because it's inconvenient to you:
"The recent IPCC report found that the temperature rise that we are expected to see sometime around 2055-2080 will create a net cost of 0.2-2% of GDP. The UK, Japan, and the US wanted this rewritten or stricken.
The IPCC report showed that strong climate policies would be more expensive than claimed as well  costing upwards of 4% of GDP in 2030, 6% in 2050, and 11% by 2100."

 You are very correct in what you say with Pharmac making sure that its limited budget stretches further.

Expensive drugs with marginal impacts require tough choices, and some people don't like to face up to those choices.
 




 This LSE link is an affirmation of doorknocking. It is consistent with the economic concept of expressive voting.

Models of expressive voting postulate that voters consume ideological or moral stances on issues by voting for them, even when they are against the voters own narrow self interest. Expressive voting is more likely if the probability of being a decisive voter is low - the election is not close.

People vote to express certain beliefs. Voting gives a sense of identity and purpose. Expressive voting is equated to cheering for sporting teams. People vote in ways that cheer for good things and boo at bad thing.

This is why higher income people vote Green  this allows them to feel good about themselves (and perhaps then get on with climbing the greasy pole After cleansing themselves with a morally attuned vote).

Another way to find identity and purpose is to vote for a particular candidate because he asked you personally - you're doing him a favour. Good people do favours and listen to arguments and personal appeals.

 Nice story about the last holdouts to vaccination 




 A nice summary of the political psychology of partisan divide.

The drawback of these studies as with others is that a particular focus on the fact that people's voting patterns changes they get older, they get more conservative.

They often lack a gender analysis: women are much more likely to change their vote than men depending on whether they are single, married, a single parent or recently divorced. This vote switching is driven by the demand for social insurance in different family circumstances. 




 Isn't the correct course of action. A complaint to the police? It's a job of the police to investigate allegations such as this.

 In his influential book, Capital in the 21st Century, Thomas Piketty argues forcefully that rising wealth and wealth inequality is an inherent characteristic of capitalist economies and calls for strong policy responses, in particular a substantial wealth tax implemented globally. 

This paper takes issue with the facts, logic, and policy conclusions in Pikettys book, suggesting that the factors needed to support the inexorable rise in capitals share and concentration are lacking and that among tax policy reforms aimed at dealing with economic inequality a wealth tax finds little support either in Pikettys own work or elsewhere in the literature.

 Recessions harm the bottom of the income ladder much more than the middle or top.

In recessions, the unemployment rate of University graduates doubles to 4%.

 Labor input growth during the recovery of the U.S. economy from the Great Recession of 20082009 has been considerably lower than expected. A number of scholars have attributed this disappointing outcome to the prospect of higher taxes, induced by the fiscal imbalances that will materialize in coming decades under current policies.

The paper finds that the empirical relevance of the fiscal sentiment hypothesis depends on whether this Frisch elasticity of labor supply is closer to the relatively large values needed to account for the observed volatility of labor input at business cycle frequencies, than to the lower values estimated by microeconomic and quasi-experimental studies.

 There was a massive trial with the polio vaccine before it was introduced in the whole community. The trial involved hundreds of thousands of children. 




 Measles is the most contagious disease that is known. It is therefore not possible to use tort liability to sue the specific person who infected you because it is not possible to trace the infection to a specific child.

The classic example was polio. 90 to 95% of people infected with polio were asymptomatic but infectious to others. It was spread by failing to wash your hands properly after going to the toilet. Small children tend to do that.

 The flaw in the reasoning about administrative costs been at driver of higher costs in America is competition.

Leaving to one side the Federal prohibition against interstate competition in health care plans, and any state mandates as to what must be in ill health care plan, two considerable asides, all the is saying is there is an entrepreneurial opportunity to win business in health insurance by offering simple plans that are cheap to administer.

The extent that administratively complex plan survive in competition rather than because of mandates, suggest that consumers are willing to pay for whatever they buy.

A nice reminder of the 1960s and that the Apollo program was incredibly expensive for its time. Something that is forgotten in retrospect, especially when it's put forward as a rationale for further public investment in incredibly expensive science projects. 




 I actually disagree with the Australian system which I used to be subject to. 

First, people save far too much for their retirement. So much so, that they'll be wealthier in their retirement, if they make it that far, than they were during their working lives.

Secondly, there are required to save for their retirement before they have bought other basic things such as a car and a house deposit.

The practical upshot of the Australian system is that low paid workers save for their own retirement rather than rely on an means tested old age pension that would be funded by taxes on the middle-class. These low paid workers are in the peculiar position of having retirement savings but not enough savings to buy a house.

 david Friedman argues on this that

It follows that the employer will insist on such an agreement only if he believes that its value to him is greater than its cost to the employee The contract is designed, after all, with the objective of getting the other party to sign it."

Libertarians do attract a lot of comment and the Twitter Left is rather keen to label the right-wing opponents, as libertarians. This is despite the fact a lot of voters don't understand what a libertarian is.

Indeed, back in the 1990s, most libertarian gatherings were so small that they would not need to book ahead at a restaurant to make sure they got a table.

It is only recently that Milton Friedman became a respectable figure in policy circles. Indeed, at job interviews in the 1990s, if you mentioned Hayek's name, and there is any sign of name recognition, you would been interviewed by a very well read people.

As I recall my warned over Marxism, is the idea of violent protests to exit provoked that backlash and the resulting repression cause the proletariat to see that capitalists for whom they are and rise up and overthrow them.

I then detrended these real GDP data series by their respective trend rates of growth: 1.9% for the UK and 3.6% for Ireland. 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT 

Light penalties widely applied and serious penalties applied to a few can both deter unlawful behaviour. But in the case of riots, it is hard to prove wrongdoing and important to clear the streets. Arresting widely and temporarily can be more effective. 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT

Arrests for alleged violent crimes were involved in three of every four reported homicides by law enforcement personnel - a force-on-force situation, such as an intervention with an ongoing assault, robbery or murder

A nice little roundup of life before vaccines became available shortly before I was born when which means I was lucky 




 In an historic building, it is normally impossible to change any of the exterior of the building. Routine repairs attract scrutiny and as for the chances of any renovation that changes the building, forget it 




 In Excel, I first computed real GDP PPP per working age person for Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain using working age population data from OECD StatExtract and the conference board, total database on real GDP levels PPP.

I then detrended growth in the four countries by 1.9%. 




 I used Excel to divide the working age populations of Italy, Germany and France into real GDP PPP since 1950. I then detrended those series by 1.9% to see when there was above and below trend growth.

The working age population data was from OECD StatExtract; the real GDP PPP data was from the conference board, total database.
 




 Is an opportunity to apply your own economic skills to what he is saying 




 Thanks for these superb link. Christina Romer writes some really good stuff 




 When I have time, I'll dig out an article written by Paul Krugman in 1998, making the exact same points as the American Enterprise Institute, but with a more detailed analysis of the fiscal politics. 




 Using Excel, I first constructed real GDP per working age person using working age population data from OECD Statextract which was then divided into real GDP PPP data from the conference board, total database.

I then detrended the real GDP growth data for Sweden, Britain and also the USA as a comparator by 1.9% using Excel to plot the data. 




 I used Excel to plot data from my country and for the USA from a comprehensive international database at the Federal reserve bank of Dallas on housing prices.  




 They have 5 seats. Could be the difference. 




 You could be right. Wasn't that 600 million years ago? 




 where? 




 I used Excel and Open Office Draw to divide real GDP purchasing power parity for New Zealand, Switzerland and Australia from the conference board total database by their respective working age populations from OECD statextract.

I compared New Zealand and Swiss GDP per working age person with that in Australia to show a normal economy as compared to two in long depressions.

I then detrended real GDP purchasing power parity per working age New Zealander, Swiss and Australian by 1.9% to show that Swiss and New Zealand economies had deviated by 30% or more from trend between the 1973 and the early to mid-1990s. That is, both economies were in a great depression over those respective periods. 




 The point of the article title written in Australian English is irony: after decades and decades of mass use and but one death and that is disputed apparently 




 I reproduced a UK chart for New Zealand using Excel to analyse 2013 Census data to create several pie charts and a time series chart to show the extent to which a Generation Rent has emerged in New Zealand in the last 10 years.

I then used the economist housing price index tool to create individualised charts to see how housing affordability had tracked the emergence of generation rent in New Zealand and Australia.  




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT

LBGT people probably are attracted to jobs that either:
(a) require subtle interactional skills, which they have cultivated because they live in a hostile environment, or 
(b) they seek jobs where they can work by themselves so they dont have to deal with hostility or constantly trying to stay submerged. 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT.

Yet another excellent application of the Dunning Kruger effect. The notion that opinions are equal implies nobody is wrong and nobody is right 




 In a disappointing omission by a newspaper that fancies itself was the newspaper of record for America, the New York Times article did not mention that teenage girls simply are much better at reading in PISA tests than teenage boys and therefore will make different career choices to men because they want to take advantage of their full mix of skills 




 Maybe you do not understand the larconic tone of the Australian English title 




 What do you mean? 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT.

A wonderful collection of data and surrounding discussions that shows how rapid social change can be. People think nothing ever changes, but the article shows things can change and change rapidly. 




 None of the British reporting I have seen, such as in the Guardian point to examples where rent controls are kept rents down without supply falling short of demand. 




 The offsetting behaviour effect found by the study reported in this post is simply brilliant 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT.

A relatively impartial and balanced roundup of presidential deceptions over the last 60 years and their consequences. Well worth reading, especially if you're a political junkie. 




 I thought the recent elections weren't too bad in that there were actually some issues in the election that were not sectarian. 

I'm told water pricing was a big issue in a recent election. That was big achievement because it wasn't a sectarian issue 




 Russia is going through the same sort of process with Stalin. They either love him or hate him.

The blogger linked from is fascinated with dictators and is very good at explaining things such as cults of personality and why dictators can be personally popular despite the rest of their administration been extremely unpopular with ordinary people.

Abandon footnotes is one of the best blogs I have come across in the last few months 




 Thanks. The particular blog the link came from, which is based across town from me seems to be fascinated with Spanish history and politics, particularly anything to do with dictators.

Last time I put a link on history sub Reddit it was deleted because I didn't include a comment summarising the link. Not easy to put in a comment when you're operating off the mobile phone or tablet rather than your desktop. 




 Monopsony is a bit overrated in my view particularly for unskilled workers who can actually move into a lot more jobs than I can as a University graduate 




 I used Excel to deduct the usual 1.5% bias because of new goods, quality variation and the like from the consumer price index inflation rates of Germany, France and the UK. 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT

A nice little roundup of the constitutional protections of the rights of parents vis-a-vis their children over the years in the Supreme Court 




 All agree that the consumer price index (CPI) is biased and overstates inflation. In 1996, economists hired by the Senate Finance Committee estimated that the U.S. CPI overstates annual inflation by 1.1% (Boskin et al. 1996). That estimated CPI bias has not gotten smaller with time. It is now up to 1.5%, even 2%.

I thought I might see what happened if I I used Excel two take account of this one and a half percentage point annual bias because of new goods, quality variation and other known biases in the CPI estimates for the USA, UK and Japan in the relevant OECD StatExtract database for annual CPI inflation.
 




 In addition to the 20% of College males will have an off-campus girlfriend one or two years younger, you must remember Seinfeld's law: 20% of the population are undateable.

As a college bound young woman is most likely quite datable, they will suffer in particular from Seinfeld's law cutting 20% off pool of college-age boys. 




 I use Excel to chart the Cara McDaniel database for the average tax rate on labour income and capital income, the average tax rate on consumption expenditure and investment expenditures and Social Security contributions for the United States, Canada and then the UK, all calculations from 1950.

I then use Excel to calculate real GDP per working age American, Canadian and British by taking working age population data from OECD StatExtract and dividing it by real GDP purchasing power parity data from the conference board, total database from 1950. 




 The average tax rates on consumption, investment, labour and capital for Australia and New Zealand are constructed in Excel from a database developed by Carla McDaniel from her Ph.D.

These trends in average tax rates for Australia and New Zealand are then compared with the performance of their economies with an Excel chart constructed from working age population data in OECD StatExtract and real GDP PPP data from Conference Board Total Database, January 2014.  




 Using Excel, I compare data on annual hours worked per engaged person tweeted by Max Roser with an annual hours worked per working age person series with the USA, Germany, West Germany and France.

I constructed this series with Excel using working age population data from OECD StatExtract and total hours worked data from the conference board total database. These series started in 1950 or 1956.

I then used Excel to construct average tax rates on labour income from Cara McDaniel's website to calculate average tax rates on labour incomes in the USA, Germany and France since 1950 to explore reasons for the differences between the Max Roser tweet data and mine.
 




 The working age population data is from OECD StatsExtract. Excel is then used to divide that into  real GDP PPP data from the conference board, total economy database, which is then detrended at 1.9% per year for both economies. 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT.

With the exception of Israel, the Middle East allies of the United States are the type of friends that make you prefer your enemies. Indeed, in Syria, apart from the Kurds, very hard to find anyone you want to line up with.  




 Homeopathy has been part of the NHS since its foundation. There was even a homoepathic Hospital, which I think closed recently 




 Detrended with Excel using data from the OECD StatsExtract and from the Conference Board Total database using trend growth rates frequently employed by Edward Prescott and his writings on Japan and USA respectively. 




 Yes, a great list of yours

 Those neoliberal tax reforms saved the welfare state. 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT

When Brennan said at a tax reform conference in Australia over 20 years ago that efficient taxes and tax reforms are both bad because they lead to higher taxes and a larger government, no one understood him.

Idealists all, the audience, including me, assumed they were advising a benevolent government, not a revenue-maximising leviathan government  a beast that needed to be staved with constitutional constraints on the number and size of tax bases and tax instruments.

Fiscal arrangements were analysed by Buchanan and Brennan in The Power to Tax in terms of the preferences of citizen-taxpayers who are permitted at some constitutional level of choice to select the fiscal institutions they are to be subject to over an uncertain future.

Those in elected office are assumed to exploit the powers assigned to them to the maximum possible extent: government is a revenue-maximising leviathan.

Buchanan and Brennan were all for inefficient tax systems because they do not raise as much revenue. A government that cannot raise much revenue cannot grow very large.

It was a number of years before I came to agree with Brennan and Buchanan. I had to break out of my applied welfare economics thinking and move over to constitutional political economy.

Tax reform saved the late 20th century welfare state by raising the same or more revenue with less taxpayer resistance.
