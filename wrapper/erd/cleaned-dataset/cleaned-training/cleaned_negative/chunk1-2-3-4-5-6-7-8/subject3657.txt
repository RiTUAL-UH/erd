 If your a fan of It Follows I highly recommend you watch The Guest. It is a action/horror/thriller with a lot of the same vibes and similar music. I personally love It Follows because of the pool scene, the music, and the last shot which sticks with you
 
























 Tarantino making a sci-fi Space epic. Something that takes place in a huge universe yet at the end of the day focuses on the main characters and their dialogue. 
























 people would shit bricks if this ever happened.   One can dream 
























 Cars 2.................lol jk

I Recommend Fast 5. Its the best in the series by far ( in my opinion)  
























 Argo.....it just sits on my shelf, I know I should watch it but for some reason I just haven't  
























 The Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has the depth, the Lore, The Grand Scale.

And It will be remembered 20 years from now 
























 The Lego Movie.

Everyone Praises it for being the "Best Animated Film" of 2014.

Although it was visually stunning, I thought the movie was boring, stale, and I did not really connect with the humor.  I do understand the movie's appeal to others, it just is not a good film in my eyes. 
























 I feel the same way about this movie !. After watching it I was very underwhelmed. It was clever, unique, and visually impressive. But when it finished I also did not get the hype. I think the hype comes from the director ( Wes Anderson), the dude has a cult following.
