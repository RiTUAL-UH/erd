 [A Touch of Cloth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Touch_of_Cloth), biting satire of British procedurals (and American). It was created by Charlie Brooker who worked with Chris Morris on Nathan Barley. Chris Morris played Denholm Reynholm from IT Crowd. I could go on, but I have to poo.

 Ooo great idea will have to revisit this one 




 Its "the walk," Hollywood version of man on wire. 




 That's a good idea, but I'm going to have to wait for the movie to come out. Right where this ends giant "coming soon" "imax 3d" text comes zooming in towards the viewer. My orig idea was to do a huge 3d k zooming in after the 3d imax, but I couldn't get the timing to work. Also I tried fading out "the walk" to just "k" but that looked stupid with my shitty ae skills.

 gah that sucks  
i've used it without too many problems on both fedora and ubuntu 14.10, currently using it primarily on 14.10, if that helps at all. 




 kdenlive is kind of like premiere, I guess. I can chop stuff up easily and apply most effects (composite, transitions, speed) but it crashes if I apply too many at once. One of these days I'll have to make a miserable hifw trying to learn blender gif.  
Also, I could never get motion tracking to work in kdenlive, hence ae/ps

 I've found it easier to composite in pngs of the text using a video editor and then use gimp for the final crop/touch up stuff. If you use linux kdenlive+ffmpeg+gimp can get you started. I think /u/matt01ss did some gimp tutorials a long time ago. Maybe /u/jimlast3 or /u/chemicalole can chime in on your specific question.
