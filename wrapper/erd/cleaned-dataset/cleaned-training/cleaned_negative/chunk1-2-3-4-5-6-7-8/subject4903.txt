 Can you change the color of the upper border (where minimize, maximize, close buttons are) from white to another color? 
That design is so tiering for the eyes at night with that all white window 
























 Yes Mammoth that is what I meant but I did not knew what is it called. Thanks for the answers guys 










































































 Hey dudes and dudettes. Anyone running  AMD cards has problems with the game crashing? As I stated in the title this happened to me even before 9.9. Granted my AMD card is an older one a HD 7770 but I don`t seem to have these problems in other games so the driver/card is fine and I also run the game at low settings. I tried new drivers, even tried reverting back to several older versions but this problem is still there. 










































































 Will PETA come after me when they find out how many mosquitos I have killed this summer? Because I have treated them badly
