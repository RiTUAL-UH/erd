 There Will Be Butthole 




 I like this!  I need to do this...After I beat the Hydra I kind of just sat there thinking how cool this game is, gazing upon the bottomless lake.  Went up the ladder without completely running around the lake for that golem.  Really trying hard not to use guides except for which weapons I shouldn't be wasting my shards and embers on.  Thanks! 




 I do have my battle axe at +4..... 




 I'm level 38, Sorcerer (hi strength, dexterity and intelligence)....Have beat Havel using parrying and backstabs, beat the Darkroot Hydra, and Moonlight Butterfly etc, but CAPRA DEMON !!  Such little space to move around and those dogs!  I can kill one by throwing firebombs over the gate before I go in, but when I go in he just steamrolls me.  Using Drake Sword and Dragon Crest shield....What else do I need to do?!?!
edit: Thanks for all the help, really appreciate it! 




 The thing that bothers me the most is how these anti-gay, self righteous, 'morally just' people can smile while they protest people's right to live and be happy, and free from unwarranted social injustice.  Ignorance IS bliss i guess. 




 I live in LA and never get to sees stars like this.  This is porn.

 Who Framed Roger Rabbit    
the animators, who created all the characters.everything involved in this movie is suspect...theoretically who framed Roger Rabbit is a 'biobpic'.  Lots to explore here. 




 Shit.  "Here's the new shit".  "I am the shit".  "You can't handle this shit".  
I stood next to a young woman at an airport baggage claim who was on the cell phone telling the other party that she was in fact "waiting for her shit" to come through the conveyor, then she would meet said party at the designated meeting area.   Presumably to talk shit about each other. 




 Its friday he gets more than one :) 




 Katana-Rama!  BANGBANG! BANGBANGBANG!  also chimichangas. 




 (cracks knuckles) Seeing's how I'm on an ADR stage and waiting for the next 'talent' I thought I'd join this whole ADR, Pam, Pan debate.  If anyone calls it 'Automatic Dialogue Replacement' it's cause you're on set, record a take but notice that an airplane sound (or dogs barking, or a car horn or anything NOT related to the sound sonically) is on the recording.  Well you like the performance but the audio is bad, so you will be "Automatically REplacing the Dialogue" later to preserve the shot.
Generally speaking you should think of ADR as ADDITIONAL Dialogue replacement".  Such as Voice Over (narration) or bad quality audio that you don't notice till the dialogue edit happens.  Or if you have to revoice an actor for various reasons.  Hope this helps!  ...and her name was PAM like the spray.
edit: Also LOOPING refers to the days when we still used film for the ADR stage, they would just loop the line over and over and the actor would say the line in a loop.  We still do it sometimes these days, but the word Loop just stuck.   




 Sooooo...you're both assholes?

 Still need help?  I'll be around tonite US Pacific time 




 And you bought all the transients from the undead female merchant?  Jagged ghost blade and cursed greatsword (made from Soul of Sif) kills ghosts.  If you can get one transient and you have the gold serpent ring I would highly suggest doing some transient farming on the ghosts.  Also you don't HAVE to go here right away.... 




 Sounds good!  I'll be on tonite like 8? pacific time 




 Got dragon scales?  I've got 10+ eye of deaths... 




 You can buy skme from undead female merchant in tunnel before burg or serpent ring farm some from the ghosts.   




 I'm on PS3 and have been in the Burg recently.  last nite I lose my first two rounds, get summoned for a third and as soon as I arrive the 'Target Destroyed' and bam 660k souls!  This seems to happen once or twice for me every time I fight for a couple hours.
The worst part of PvP for me is the lag.  lately I've been getting backstabbed from the side or even front! 




 rock and roll!  message me back here later where you're at... 




 My friend Sarah Sitkin made the video for [Little Red Lung - 50 Fingers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx-xE8GOoxk) !
 




 the "Four" Kings...when I finally beat this boss, there were three other Kings waiting in the Abyss for their turn.  Definitely a race against the clock.  I ended up two handing a Dragon's Tooth and using a +15 Pyromancy.  Also, I spent a lot of time PvP-ing and co-oping to level up a lot, so I recommend that as well 




 yea relax, go to where you killed the bell gargoyles and talk to ol' ozzy.  He'll set you straight.   




 But wait!  Smough and Ornstein! 




 Pam and Jim's wedding on the Office.  It was cool until the dance thing at the wedding.  Threw my hands up and said I'm out of here, but came back later....to the cold open where they do that little music video thing at the beginning starting with Andy in the elevator.  Terrible.

 Just some quick questions/rant....Sorry in advance if these are 'basic' questions...
Never took the covenants too seriously mainly because I think of Dark Souls as a game vs man (singular)....Anyways, got all the way to Smough and Ornstein in Way of White without summoning another player besides the two Knights for Gaping Dragon who I ended up beating without their help anyways....Was having some 'difficulties' with Smough and Ornstein and decided to upgrade my weapons with Andre/Giant Blacksmith and then figured I'd stay around Andre and join the Forest Hunter and see what happens, mainly because I want ALL the rings....  Little drunk during the whole joining process with Alvina, but all of a sudden bam I'm invading and fighting and at 99k souls when my max ever had been like 30k!!  The past two days haven't been as awesome and here's my questions....

1. Is forest hunter all 2v1 ???  
2. Anyone that's human running through this area has a chance of being invaded by me regardless if they want to, right?  
3. Is it random who I invade?  
4. Are people waiting to be invading/summoning me, and if so how?
5. When I get close to someone so our shields can touch they're all of a sudden backstabbing me.  How do I do this?  I thought I was good at it....
6. Can I summon another Forest Hunter member to fight people?  
7.  Is there a better covenant for someone like me who likes a more 1v1 approach?  I just don't like getting ready to fight someone then all of a sudden another summon is behind me blasting me in the ass.
8. Where the hell do I farm Humanity???
9. And finally, is Dark Souls online experience just another example of online gaming these days?  Where's the humanity!?!?!
Thanks again, I'm on a PS3 and want to keep PvP-ing........ 




 Billy Butthole 




 It's 'a' before a consonant sound, 'an' before a vowel sound 
























 Ha!  that's why i put something between me and him and blasted him with fireballs.  Cheese I know but hey, survivalism ya know? 




 Go back to Quelaana in Blighttown by warping to Chaos servant bonfire and going back through Queelag's boss room.  Be careful though, not to draw enemies close to her and risk aggro-ing her.  She'll upgrade your +15 to ascended +5.  I used great fireball, black flame, and great chaos fireball on Gwyn.  




 Just beat him a couple days ago on NG.  +3 Ascended pyromancy flame, and kept one of the stalagmites in between me and him i.e. Smough fight.  Done in like 5 minutes, found it suprisingly easy for the final boss.   




 http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1nwvu3/7_movies_that_will_leave_you_devastated/.   Keep seeing donnie darko and requiem as most disturbing blah blah movies and thought I'd suggest some good alternatives.   




 Company of men is pretty messed up!!  Baxter is pretty intense too good double feature! 




 I originally saw Frontier(s) on netflix streaming.... 




 Yeah that just kept getting worse and worse as it went along....sad 




 Donnie Darko?  Please.  Here's some truly devastating movies...
[Bedeviled](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBq0SLWNF-E)....[In the Company of Men](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtpmAdgl8UI)...[Martyrs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpDiQimK6U)...[Frontiers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnoGQfW51ng)...[Inside](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVGswuX42x0)...[Baxter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqJtJL6bSRg)...[In a Glass Cage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l09AIbYPWLQ)...[Schramm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgk-gBoa54o)....[Angst](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfqN2wuH_Ck)
Also 'Fat girl' by Breillat and 'Michael' by Schlienzer 




 Donnie Darko's the most over-rated crap movie ever.  You left off Martyrs, A Serbian Film, Bedeviled, In the Company of Men and Irreversible..... among others that are WAY better than Darko and Requiem 




 We are legion for we are many..... 




 About two hours ago I got summoned to help someone get to O S and there was an invader right at that spot.  I gave em the ol' Wrath of God right off that ledge....was that you per chance? 




 Mega mule right?   




 Sooo, after being a dragon for two days, I put my dragon summon in Oolacile Township.  Get two summons in about twenty minutes.  Third summon is wearing full dragon gear.  I drop a prism, he/she drops 99 of all slabs.  DRAGONBROS! 




 It's f***ing game board. 




 Block ornstein on way in to fight then run to opposite side of room staying outside pillars.  Smough isnt fast and this will help seperate them.  Pyromancy flame is great for this fight.  Rats in the depths are good for humanity farming.  Also solaire did nothing for me, just gets himself killed right away.  However he does make a nice distraction. 




 I just joined too, same question.  I know the person youre trying to invade has to have a dragon scale.  Ive had moderate success in oolacile township by pvp bonfire, other than that not so much.  I would guess the main pvp areas?  White a red signs still work fine 




 Let's rock...
 




 What's your soul level? If you go past 120 you'll have a hard time being summoned in earlier levels even for S O.  Also what system? 




 Mimic!  Oh wait it's just a chest, phew 
























 VERRRY GOOOD 




 It's like pharis hat fuckd the joker!  Also chester's jacket makes zero noise.... 




 Bonewheel skeletons and Bed of Chaos for obvious reasons.
Also I have a problem USING homing soul mass.  I wish it 'homed' better.  If I'm facing two enemies with varying health, I wish it sent one, then two etc to kill first enemy, then used the remaining mass to kill second enemy, as opposed to sending all to enemy that is closest.  But I guess that how's 'homing missiles' work.  I also wished Dragon's Breath sent enemies flying like gravelord souldance.  I mean it's 50 INT and kind of a pain in the ass to get it should do more than it does.  
Also I hope in DS2 that if I'm locked on an enemy and they fall off a cliff, I lose my lock on them as soon as they are in the point of no return on the cliff edge.  

 




 Female, White/Silver hair, Crown of Dusk, Arotrias armor, and an Obsidian Sword 2 handed (moonlight great sword also acceptable) 




 Do it! See how hard it is for us guys to be in this position!  




 Or almost anything besides going to church.  Instead of donating to collection plate take me to actually help people 




 Dark souls  




 Hope these aren't repeats - after killing dragon in painted world you can jump behind his body to go straight to priscilla.  You can kill sif with a bow on the ledge left of his fog gate.  Use your shield (L1) RIGHT at moment of impact to deflect attack without breaking poise 




 Me too :) No sword!

 Upgrade your weapons at Andre.  If you want to melee sif, try grabbing a summon to help, and stay under him and hack away.  or if you have to cheese him to move on with the game, you can jump to the ledge left of his fog gate and blast him with poison arrows.  He just sits there and takes it. 




 After killing the zombie Dragon, do a jump two hand attack on his legs and his half body will stand up (which to me is probably the coolest/weirdest thing in Dark Souls) then you can jump directly down to Pricilla!  




 Near the Avelyn? : )

 This is for...Mathilda.... 




 Thanks!  I was definitely in human form which explains the summonings.  That helps too with the tendency info, I'm going to go ahead and assume NG+ or more is in my future.. 




 Dark souls vet trying to wrap my head around this feature.  Also, the summoning is different too right?  I helped someone beat the Giant spider then ran back to help someone else and I couldn't use my summon blue or black..

 Sure!  Yea, I'm just aware of the cut items not why they were cut.  I really hope we get to interact with NPC's more in DS2....Would love to see cut scenes that show the NPCs story, like when you rescue Dusk and she's talking about how she got trapped, or with Rhea when she's talking about her 'companions'.

 Any of the knights in Anor Londo drop a good amount of souls....and the Lightning Zwei is good for everything!  Chaos Zwei is pretty brutal too...

 
























 welllll....besides the premise itself, they explain how awesome the security systems are.  Then the kids try to break in and Ethan hawke is like, "well ya know nothing's '100%' safe".  what???  Also it's not the son's first Purge right?  So why is he letting people in?  Why does the kid even have access to the security system to begin with?  Why would there ever be a scenario where for one night, do whatever you want,  because then for the rest of the year you'll be on your best behavior!  Then, it just turns into another lame american horror movie where all the bad guys HAVE to cock their head to the side while wearing a mask before they kill someone.  The girls HAVE to be in white dresses holding hands skipping around.  Pick an any American horror movie from the last ten years and I can almost guarantee it will have a young white girl in a white dress.  Then oh yeah the neighbors are psychotic killers too.  Shyamalan twist bitches.  It just, ugh was so bad.  Could have been a fun b-movie schlock fest but took itself to seriously.  the only reason I went in the first place was a second date with a girl.   That was our last date : )  And don't get me started on Sinister!  Why is there Academy Leader (the 3 2 1 countdown) at the beginning of the reels of footage?  Did the bad guy take the reels to get post production work? 




 The Purge was probably the stupidest movie I've seen in a loooong time.  Just dumb.

 I do post audio for movies/tv and let me tell you, it's not just comedies but ALL movies.  After the 'economy' in 2009, this has become the new standard.  It's either Avengers, or independent stuff that will show up on Netflix and people will pass over because they haven't seen or heard anything about it.   It sucks.  The company I work for are constantly getting underbid by people working out of their garages and then the clients eventually come to us to fix the problems.  The middle class really is gone.  We have a team of five full time staff and we have to do four movies at once to stay open.  But to be honest this whole business is screwy....I wish I had more answers, but it seems people are just cutting costs everywhere.

 I startd the game almost exactly like this, except I actually got pretty far with my magic and no shield.  Hell go watch a no shield fists only run to give you some confidence!  

Dont worry the game is a little confusing as far as 'where to go next'.  But that's dark souls for ya!  I say NG is like a practice run through and the real game starts NG+.  Keep a notebook and write stuff down like, 'black door in forest area wont open'.  By the time you get the necessary items you will probs forget where to go to use them!


The lady in Majula will level you up by the bonfire. Defs get some strength to hold a shiled and get a longsword and level it up.  Start putting points in att and int.  Do a rounded charactwr with faith and int.  You will find a staff that will cast sorcereries, hexes AND miracles it's awesome.  Also for a first run, join the way of blue cove so if you get invaded, a blue sentinel can be summoned automatically to help you kill the invader.  You can be invaded while hollow now.....

Oh and talk to everyone!!  And....pull the lever
