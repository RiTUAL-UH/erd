 no. 




 go play rust if you're just going to bitch and complain  




 you must have severe autism 




 the machete is really bad, its better to use your fists. make sure you aim for the head also 




 i just found this out and wanted to share my findings, guess ive already been beat 




 nobody cares 




 the first car is supposed to come before the end of the year, and barricading is starting to come in right now. 




 become a woodsman and hunt animals 




 for future reference, its 'Dawg' gotta turn up that gangsta  




 this is ironic coming from you xD 




 yea he was fine  afterwords  




 u cannot fixerino this terentino  with a riperino lamentino 




 many years ago my friend cracked a glow stick open and sprayed juice in his eye, had to shower with his eyes facing the faucet  




 you have much potential.  




 well thats their problem 




 every single thing you said has been confirmed for the game. do some research before making a dumb post. 




 no, you're just covering your ass for being a retard 




 you must know absolutely nothing about game development. 




 are you retarted? 




 they are easy, you just suck 




 seems  cool but people would just have both at the same place and when they die on one they go on the other kill the people and get the loot. 




 it doesnt matter why you did it, you still changed game files, which is against the rules. 




 people like him are the only ones who know whats going on 
























 aww is the little one mad? you shouldn't have temper tantrums on the internet kiddo ;) 




 a DMR is basically just an M14 with a scope, so id rather see the M14 in and be able to put the long range scope on it, and spray paint it black. boom a DMR 




 get better 




 they have stated that they wanted to add more places like skalisty, but they arent sure what they want to add. 




 since they shifted the season to summer i really dont see a need for heat packs 




 especially with the new darkness, you wouldn't notice it if you weren't looking exactly at it 




 its shift i think
 




 TLDR 




 hypOthermia is cold, hypERthermia is hot 




 thats to be expected, they re in fact, **EXPERIMENTAl**
 




 that makes literally 0% sense  




 the first vehicle, the V3S military truck, will most likely come in .51 or before christmas 




 neato 




 you have much potential in the jimmy rustler community, young grasshopper 




 try to be less obvious about trolls next time, might be more effective 




 yes, literally everyone. 




 says you :D 




 i think there was a nuclear power plant on taviana 




 the community will be much better without you, leave. 




 games take on average 3-4 years, this game has been in development for just over 2. **IT SAYS MANY TIMES NOT TO BUY THE GAME** 




 the first vehicle is very close to being finished, so it will be out before the end of the year. 




 uh, no. 




 it doesn't need to be balanced at all, if you dont like it get better.  
























 player tensions are what make dayz, dayz. people are willing to kill entire squads to get one vehicle, making, repairing one, and keeping it hidden a very high priority, as it should be.

So i made this in like 45 mins because it seems like fun to make maps for people to play. If you have any tips for improvement like cover/sniper nests/etc. it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! 




 its hard reading comments as autistic as yours  




 ur dumb as fuck arent you 




 get over it, literally nobody cares what happened to you 




 reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepost 




 to find the last server you played on, click "play" in the main menu instead of "choose server" 




 you're dumb as fuck 




 like you could do better 




 if you dont play the game, why the fuck do you care what it looks like. and no, you couldnt make it any better 




 Step 1: take off all gear. Step 2: jump in a lake. 




 TLDR 




 spacebar? 




 probably not the only one 




 "hey kid wanna buy some drugs?" 




 i assume you have mild to severe autism 




 i usually play dayz for a week, then csgo, then dayz... etc. 




 im from the midwest, and i dont call it pop, and neither does anybody i know 




 this is a really bad idea. try again 




 why are you tying to shoot underwater 




 yea green oops 




 nobody cares 




 who cares 
























 are you dumb? 




 get better 




 that would make it extremely easy to get guns, which isnt good for dayz 




 its bad 




 Basically playing lone wolf is boring and nothing ever gets done. If you are interested in contacting me my steam name is Microbyte with a RS 2007 elf as the profile picture. I prefer teamspeak, but i can work with skype.  









 Do you think this would be a good idea for a map?

the image is taken from http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=5343 with some slight adjustmants to orientation. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. (This map is only for me to see the tepography, i already have a basic version of it here: http://imgur.com/CGxj8CQ ) 




 how many times are people going to comment dumb shit that was confirmed to be coming like a year ago 




 its more than one per server. most likely wont increase, its meant to be very difficult to get a ghillie 









 thanks man! 




 So i want to have crates from maps like Dust2 and Inferno, but i dont know how to get them into my map. can anybody help me out? Thanks! 




 Here is a link to the original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/hammer/comments/2o40wm/first_csgo_map_idea/
Here is a top view of the map: http://imgur.com/sZr3zDt

So i started the grey/orange basic version of my first map idea, and finished it! (probably) Here are some screenshots:

 alright man ill keep that in mind! 




 i tried to start it yesterday, but i dont know much so didnt continue, but i do plan on starting soon 




 what if i added some double doors and boxes to inhibit the t's view of b: http://imgur.com/k6xPYNi 




 maybe i could put a wall there from T to a tunnles and have a hole with something to break like in mirage to mid/window,  and also at the windows at mid: http://imgur.com/PX2ncic 




 i have Hammer and plan to start making it sometime soon, but i just got it and dont know much :/ 




 So i made this in like 45 mins because it seems like fun to make maps for people to play. If you have any tips for improvement like cover/sniper nests/etc. it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

http://imgur.com/h9Pfkbs 




 thanks for the info! 




 what if i moved it farther away like Nuke so that CT's had more time to get there
http://imgur.com/h9Pfkbs
 




 if you didnt care what people thought, you wouldn't have posted it to reddit. 




 im tired of these "wah wah somebody killed me this game sucks" posts. seriously, its annoying. nobody cares that you found somebody in cherno and looted up then died. 
























 ik, and ill be sure to update it once further progress is made. :) 




 Firstly, i know thats not how heightdata works, its just a basic placeholder so i know where i will eventually put them, and build around them and not worry about elevation. And thanks for the additional tips, ill be sure to keep them in mind 




 Ill be sure to take a look at those videos soon, but for the moment i added some mountains/hills that are actually in ireland, its not pretty, but it will do the job

http://imgur.com/Vi3g66d 




 So i have added some new ideas to my map (it is still just a drawing that i have moved from paint into paint.net to allow me to have more freedom to do assorted things) First, some 'story' about parts of the map. the northern most city, "North City" has a tall wall going around the surrounding area. Players will need special clothes in order to survive the radiation of north city for more than a minute. North City will have lots of military loot and will (hopefully) be a hotspot for players to go to to get good gear. This idea isn't even 10% done, so any feedback would be highly appreciated.

http://imgur.com/dhDhOZO 




 If i were ever to make it it would be somewhat smaller than altis, its just the shape that i am getting from ireland 




 i can always just make it smaller if i ever end up actually making it 




 The terrain is a 70% replication of the island of Ireland, rotated 90* to the left. I have some basic ideas on where mountains will be, but haven't given much thought into choke points yet. no cities or towns have been added yet, as i am having trouble designing them 




 So i gave up on making the design for this map awhile ago, but recently started working on it again. Here is the basic drawing: http://imgur.com/lWDKGJp Each square is 1 Km by 1 Km, at the longest points it is 14 Km horizontally, and 12 Km vertically. Soon i will add mountains and elevation lines. all feedback is wanted. 




 yep, because as long as its in alpha, it still applies  




 So at the moment i have a basic map i made in Paint, and i want to know what software i need to make it look like the maps of chernarus and other maps, any and all help is highly appreciated.

my map - http://imgur.com/wkkgzit
reference map - http://imgur.com/m70sWow 




 what i really like is the gloomy clouds and the street lamps, as well as the flooded area. its good, and i look forward to exploring its depths. (you should put some easter eggs like hidden areas or messages)

 how can you not like the dayz mod, ive heard of people not liking standalone, but never the mod 




 good 




 http://lmgtfy.com/?q=DayZ+Standalone+changlogs

 how about you quit bitching, and get better so you dont have a horde of zombies  behind you

 they prob rent servers to farm loot 




 1. this game has been out for 1 year, not 2
2. crying about it wont help anything 




 pink armband  everything else in the game 




 you're basically screwed 




 http://imgur.com/FdUcVn1

well, i put to rather large "hills" in, similar to the ones on taviana. each color change in 20-30 meters, and everything that is white is between 0 and 30 m high. in the image it is compared tot eh size of namalsk, for reference  




 Well I was hoping to get road map and after that put in the geography 
 




 me too 




 hes a hipster 




 or you could just learn how to read russian 




 nobody cares 




 tldr 




 dayz 




 try epoch or overpoch, epoch lets you build bases, and overpoch is a combination of overwatch, which adds more guns, and epoch. (ps taviana is best map NA) 




 how about you look on the map

that might help 




 ive run in to many hackers on sa, meanwhile on the mod i have never seen one 




 right click
move mouse
click 




 when does it come out? i remember on your previous posts you said relatively soon 




 i feel like you could get rust poisoning from flippping the kara around your hand :)  




 i also like teh tiger tooth, a golden knife. i hope there are rare stripe patterns 




 yes i think so, i havent seen or heard of anyone getting a knife other than th new ones in chroma 




 are none of these on Huntsman? 









 So i have the basic outline and locations of towns/cities/airfields, i just need help with design. i need help with building placements. If you could also help with road placements, but i feel as though thats too much to ask 


here is the concept: http://i.imgur.com/7z6huty.jpg

if you can help me out at all, it would be greatly appreciated 
























 H1Z1 is the same engine as Planetside, thet game aleready has the templates, vehicles, and weapons. The DayZ engine was built from scratch so they have to make all of the base things 




 In empty space we know it isnt actually empty, there are tons of things in empty space. But what is between atoms themselves? is that perfect empty space? 




 PC Specs:
Intel i5-4440s 2.80 GHz
8Gb DDR3 RAM
H81M-A motherboard
GeFORCE GT 640 




 So i keep getting this error when i try to install something for give admin access to something, could anybody be any help?
Windows 8.1
i heard somewhere it was a memory issue so i have 8gigs ddr3
 




 Step 1: Don't Capitalize Every Word  




 Dayz is cpu intensive not gpu 




 I want to know what your thoughts are on this and how i could improve it

http://imgur.com/GetrbkJ 




 nvm i fixed it 




 now the game wont even launch 




 So i launch the game and start playing on a server and after about 5 minutes stuff like this starts to happen and it gets really laggy (5 fps). then my game crashes. does anybody know how to fix this? id really like to keep playing this game.

http://imgur.com/O3DBgq2 




 if you were a developer you would know that isnt how development works, so i highly doubt you are a developer 




 you must know nothing about game development, the people who make models and clothing CANT CODE AI. i dont see how this is still confusing to dumb people 




 i guess i just haven't decided yet 




 yes i know, i guess its an easter egg for those who catch it 




 i was thinking it could be a really hot desert with nothing in it or really high mountains with no desirable resources  




 So i just now found this subreddit from Vsauce3's video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=160GmnKOeps index=8 list=PLiyjwVB09t5xhhW0IfHke782_PqlLOxU0

and i just wanted to share a fictional map i have created and would appreciate any tips for realistic borders.

 Cry about it until you realize nobody pitties you for being friendly 




 By recent do you mean the new patch released a week ago? 




 To clarify, yes, I was double carrying. I had a mosin on my back and the ak in my hands, when I stop in a bush to reorganize. I had forgotten I was dual carrying and drank a soda. I then realized that the ak had been lost, and I was too far away to justify going back and getting it. 




 So i just lost my Ak101 when it dropped near a bush, and im just wondering why this still happpens 




 we dont need boats as long as we have the V3S submarine 




 they are really only useful for distractions because they draw attention to them 




 i played today for 3 hours and only saw about 5-6 zombies 





























 well these 45 upvotes seem to say otherwise 




 i got the Red 9 and Winchester off of some guy who tried to rush me in a police station 




 How good is farming atm? 




 The Model 70 is extremely accurate and i haven't had the chance to test the Red 9 yet. 




 So I have brown-level hunger and after searching through 3 rather large cities/towns and not finding any food, i decided to search for apples. 15 minutes later and 20 apples eaten my hunger has not gone down at all. They either need to make apples better or raise the chance of finding apples. (its also weird that you can see apples on the trees yet somehow dont find any)

If you are going to have nature be the only way to find food, make it common.

After running around the countryside for a few hours i had only spotted 1 animal, a moose. however, as soon as i saw it (about 200m away) it bolted away from me making it impossible to hunt. 




 where did you find the hunting scope 




 go inland 




 go inland, there is plenty of loot inland 




 Do you know where the scope spawns? i want to put it on my Model 70 




 duct tape and a little elbow grease 









 Will this map be ported over to standalone once the renderer and mod tools are released  




 (Based on group activity)

Phase 1
Jordan, James, Sly, Dan, Ze, Sp00n, Seamus

Phase 2
Jordan, James, Aleks, Dan, Kevin, Dex (Seamus?)

Now we wait for what Phase 3 of The Creatures will be. 




 dont try and shoot right after running 




 games been out for a year, you haven't waited for years 




 id be willing to bet that the one unlocked after the campaign is the Chicago one we've been hearing about. 




 What kind of setting is Laboratory rumored to be in? 




 So i haven't seen anybody talk about this, so ill take the initiative and do so. 

http://i.imgur.com/ohFafpm.jpg

From this we can gather that a map (or maybe just the trailer) is set in an old-style house/indoors. We know Samantha is in control so we can assume its during ww2/a little later. 




 cant wait for release 




 The number 621 and variations of it appear many times during the BO3 "Ember" teaser. I probably missed many times it appears, but here are the ones ive noticed. At 0:59 the time of the newscast 6:21, 1:10 the Olympic running world record 6.21, twice at 1:28- stocks up for 62.10% and for RPRK up 6.21%, at 1:56 bottom left is the time of the newscast 6:21 AM, 2:05 time of newscast 6:21 PM, and during the military scene at the end 2:26 upper right is the time.

Most likely nothing important but something i noticed. 




 So if i understood correctly, there there were 11 murders, thw puppet, the toy animatronics, golden freddy, and the bonnie Chica and foxy. If this is true, what happenes to the souls of the toy animatronics between fnaf2 and 1  




 1. Shadow Bonnie and Phantom Freddy are the replacement / temporary suits that employees wear, to Springtrap and Golden Freddy.

2. Purple Guy #1 (http://i.imgur.com/6FU0a95.png) kills The Puppet Child on the street and the 5 children using Golden Freddy at Fredbear's Diner, and later is caught and arrested.
(maybe the calls in FNaF2 are pre-recorded)

3. Purple Guy #2 / Night Guard ((http://i.imgur.com/G5vDChg.png) maybe before Jeremy?) does something unknown? to make the spirits hate him.

4. The Puppet controls the Toy Animatronics to kill the night guard in FNaF2.

5. Toy animatronics are scrapped and possessed animatronics are repaired for FNaF1 (presumably The Puppet is also scrapped).

6. The events of FNaF1 take place.

7. After FNaF1 the possessed animatronics are destroyed by Purple Guy #2 and the spirits sp00k him into Springtrap, killing him.

(afterthoughts) If the calls form FNaF2 AREN'T pre-recorded, and the 5 children are killed DURING FNaF2, why are the old animatronics from Fredbear's being possessed?
