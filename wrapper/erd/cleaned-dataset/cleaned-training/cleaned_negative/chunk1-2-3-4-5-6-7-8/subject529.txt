 This question is purely theoretical for the time being; however, I am genuinely extremely curious about this: Is putting sperm directly into a man's bloodstream a guaranteed way to permanently sterilize him? As in, is this type of male sterilization incapable of ever failing for any male?

Any thoughts on this?

Also, Yes, this is certainly a completely serious question.

 OK--here is my question:

Do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a "back-alley")?

This question is not an abstract one; rather, this question is a very real and relevant question for me personally considering that I myself want to become a eunuch in large part for sterilization reasons but also, if possible (after all, I still want to get erections using my penis) for feminization purposes and to reduce my sex drive.

Now--why exactly am I asking this? Well, many pro-choicers, both on Reddit and elsewhere, have told me that they are unwilling to deal with *any* risk of an unwanted offspring being born. Thus, I see absolutely *no* reason for me to be okay with *any* risk of this occurring. However, since I myself obviously don't have the option of abortion (and would *never* rely on *any* woman's word that she will get an abortion *regardless* of whatever promises she made to me beforehand) and consider the idea of abstaining from penis-in-vagina sex with *all* fertile and potentially fertile women to be both utterly unrealistic and utterly unacceptable, there is no other acceptable choice for me in regards to achieving this goal other than castration due to the fact that *all* non-drastic contraceptives and sterilizations have a failure rate.

Also, before someone brings up the "Do no harm" principle, I would like to point out that:

1. This principle was already thrown out of the window when doctors performed many/most medically unnecessary elective surgeries.

2. Self-castration attempts and "back-alley" castration attempts are *much* more dangerous than getting castrated (as in, getting an orchiectomy) in a safe, medical setting.

3. There is *no* other way for a man to get himself sterilized in a way which *cannot ever* fail.

4. The worst effects of castration can be mitigated/dealt with the help of hormone replacement therapy.

Also, in regards to lawsuits, let me say this--first of all, as far as I know, there are waivers for doctors to significantly reduce or eliminate this risk. However, even if one ignores that, it is worth noting that, short of a massive botching of my (planned) castration (orchiectomy), I myself would consider it to be extremely immoral to sue a doctor for performing a castration (orchiectomy) on me. After all, if I will even try suing such a compassionate and caring doctor for doing this, then this doctor might become more hesitant to perform elective castrations in the future, which in turn could very well result in more self-castration attempts and in more back-alley castration attempts (both of which are (much) more dangerous) afterwards. Thus, for me, suing such a doctor for doing this is absolutely intolerable!

In addition to this, please don't lecture me about biological differences! After all, I myself have absolutely *no* intention of being a slave to biology! After all, just because biology is unequal and unfair certainly does *not* mean that we cannot and should not make it more equal and fairer.

Thus, again, my question here is this--do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a "back-alley")?

 Are there any doctors who perform orchiectomies without a therapist letter right now? If so, then is it okay to tell me their names?

 Basically, this question is pretty self-explanatory: Other than a massive screw-up on the doctor's part during a surgery, are waivers an extremely effective way for doctors to avoid getting sued by patients who change their minds about their surgeries later on?

What especially got me curious about this is this part of this article:

http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/health/no-sex-please-were-eunuchs-28469767.html

"
Before the operation he had a half-hour consultation with the surgeon about why he wanted to be castrated. At the time I didnt know why I wanted to have it done, Roger admits. I just knew I wanted it. He wanted to make sure that it was the right decision to make. I had to sign a waiver so that I couldnt sue him for any kind of negligence. He gave me all the opportunities to back out of it.
"

Frankly, as far as I know, the doctor mentioned in this article (who I think is now deceased) never got sued by any of his patients for performing elective castrations (which, for the record, I strongly applaud him for doing due to my own egalitarian views on this and due to the fact that it is better than self-castrations and "back-alley" castrations).

Anyway, any thoughts on this?

 In your opinion, how much of a role did 9/11 have in Al Gore's decision not to run for U.S. President in 2004? After all, 9/11 and its aftermath helped push the dispute over the 2000 election into the past (which might have helped Bush) and also helped Bush by giving him an anti-terrorism and anti-Axis of Evil platform to use in his 2004 re-election campaign.

 I know that this might be a pretty unimportant issue, but what if the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum narrowly failed rather than narrowly passed (as in real life)? For the record, by "narrowly failed", I mean the pro-independence side winning, say, 54.5% of the vote and thus narrowly missing the 55.0% threshold.

Any thoughts on this? Also, it would be especially nice if someone with some knowledge of Montenegro and/or of the Balkans in general could respond to this question of mine.

 As for me, I am tempted to say that I would have created a very loose Iraqi federation with three extremely autonomous parts--a Sunni one, a Shiite one, and a Kurdish one. All of these parts get a share of the Iraqi oil revenues (based on, say, their population or whatever) as well as the right to secede (in which case they gain full control of the oil on their territory but lose their rights to the revenues from oil in other parts of Iraq). If neighboring countries have a problem with this Iraqi right to secede, then I would tell them to deal with it. Also, I would have had Iraq create a Western-style constitution which would allow democracy and free elections to occur in Iraq. In addition, I most certainly would not have disbanded the entire Iraqi Army in 2003; rather, I would have only purged the "bad apples" (as in, those with a lot of blood on their hands) at the top of this Army.  Also, before I forget, I would have also demanded that Iraq give the U.S. a part of its oil revenues in order to compensate the U.S. for its losses in Iraq.

Frankly, if my approach in regards to this would have been followed, then there might have very well been no Sunni insurgency in the 2000s in Iraq and likewise no ISIS presence in Iraq right now.

 I was wondering if anyone here who still has a penis but who already got rid of his or her testicles (for whatever reason) is able to tell me how exactly penis-in-vagina seek feels for him or her right now; specifically, does this sex feel good? As good as it was before?

The reason that I am asking this question is because I myself want to get castrated/have an orchiectomy in order to be sterilized in a way which cannot ever fail (after all, even vasectomies can fail), in order to regulate my sex drive, and in order to help feminize my body to some extent (after all, I am a gender-fluid/cross-dreaming person). However, I would still like to keep my penis indefinitely as well as to have penis-in-vagina sex.

 Was the Safavid conversion of Iran to Twelver Shia Islam an early example of a nationalistic move by a government? After all, as far as I know, the goal of this mass conversion was to help create an even more unique Persian/Iranian identity which would help Iran (then known as Persia) preserve its independence in the face of threats from the Ottoman Empire. Plus, this move made Iran an "island" of Shiism surrounded by a sea of Sunnism.

Frankly, to me, if one replaces the religious aspect with the ethnic aspect, this Safavid policy appears to be very similar to some of the policies of European nationalists in the 19th century and beyond; after all, as far as I know, some/many European nationalists in the 19th century and beyond (such as those in France) pursued policies such as teaching everyone the same dialect of their official national language in order to create and foster a greater sense of national unity and cohesiveness in their countries.

 What if Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi would have tried pursuing a rapprochement with the West in the early 2000s (such as by renouncing terrorism, paying compensation for Lockerbie, et cetera) but refused to give up his WMDs and nuclear weapons program? In this scenario, would NATO have still intervened in Libya during the Arab Spring in order to help overthrow Gaddafi?

 This might be extremely unlikely, but here goes:

What if the U.S. had given Saddam Hussein a crystal-clear and stern warning that the U.S. will intervene if he will invade Kuwait and Saddam Hussein thus decided to invade Syria instead due to the fact that, while Syria doesn't have much oil, conquering Sunni-majority Syria might allow Saddam and his Sunni supporters to further consolidate their power in Iraq. Plus, Saddam might come to believe that a rematch between Iraq and Iran is inevitable; thus, he would like to pursue regime change in Syria in order to overthrow the Iranian-allied Assad regime there and in order to eliminate the possibility of a two-front war (for Iraq--after all, Iran is on the eastern side of Iraq while Syria is on the western side of Iraq) in the future.

How exactly will an Iraqi invasion of Syria in the early 1990s (say, sometime between 1990 and 1995) turn out? Also, would there have been a significant difference in the outcome of this war if this Iraqi invasion of Syria would have occurred before as opposed to after the collapse of the Soviet Union?

 This joke is in the form of a story; anyway:

-Bob goes to Mary and Richard's house (for the record, Mary and Richard are boyfriend and girlfriend).

-Mary opens the door wearing nothing but a towel.

-Bob tells Mary: "I'll give you $500 if you will show me what exactly is covered by your towel!"

-Mary thinks about this and then temporarily removes her towel, thus showing Bob her naked body.

-Bob then gives Mary the $500, and Mary closes the door afterwards. Afterwards, Bob goes back to his house.

-With the $500 in her hands, Mary goes upstairs, where Richard currently is.

-Richard asks Mary: "Who exactly was at the door?"

-Mary replies: "Oh, it was just our creepy neighbor Bob."

-In response, Richard asks: "Did Bob ever tell you anything about the $500 that he owes me?"

 OK--basically I myself am a gender-fluid person who identifies more as male than as female; however, the idea of feeling female extremely strongly appeals to me. While I am capable of sometimes living as a (trans-)woman, I suspect that it would be very hard for me to do this all of the time; however, the idea of living as a (trans-)woman full-time would extremely strongly appeal to me if there was much less transphobia than there currently is. (For the record, I do strongly want to feminize my body, but I would still prefer to live as a male most (but certainly not all) of the time unless (God forbid) "my hand is forced" in regards to this.)

Thus, my question here is this--when exactly, if ever, do you think that we will be able to successfully change people's gender identity (on a completely voluntary basis, obviously)?

Also, to clarify--I myself certainly don't care whether or not other people would utilize such technology if it is ever developed; rather, my primary interest in such technology is personal.

 Here is my question--once we will be able to alter people's brains*, how exactly will we regulate this technology?

Any thoughts on this?

*In regards to this, I am talking about both getting rid of undesirable things, such as a sexual attraction to prepubescent children and a propensity to commit crime, as well as talking about more casual uses of such technology, such as changing one's sexuality (such as from straight to gay) and/or gender identity.

 Would such a move on Obama's part significantly backfire? Or would no one really care about such a move?

And Yes, this is a silly scenario, but it is purely hypothetical and I am genuinely extremely curious about this.

Anyway, does anyone have any thoughts on this?

 As you hopefully know, when Britain withdrew from Palestine in 1948, Palestine was (supposed to be) partitioned between the Jews and the Arabs. Likewise, when Britain withdrew from India in 1947, India was partitioned between the Hindus and the Muslims so that each of these religious groups would have a state which they would solidly dominate (of course, the Muslims in British India appear to have wanted this much more (and for obvious reasons) than the Hindus in British India did).

Anyway, what I am asking here is if there could have been any other realistic cases where European powers partitioned their colonies into two or more separate countries (in order to create separate countries for various ethnic and/or religious groups) before they (the Europeans) withdrew from these colonies and gave these colonies independence. If so, then exactly which other former European colonies could have been partitioned in this way shortly before they acquired independence?

Any thoughts in regards to this?

 OK--basically I myself am a gender-fluid person who identifies more as male than as female; however, *the idea of* feeling female *extremely* strongly appeals to me. While I am capable of sometimes living as a (trans-)woman, I suspect that it would be very hard for me to do this all of the time; however, *the idea of* living as a (trans-)woman full-time would *extremely* strongly appeal to me if there was much less transphobia than there currently is. (For the record, I *do* strongly want to feminize my body, but I would still prefer to live as a male most (but certainly *not* all) of the time unless (God forbid) "my hand is forced" in regards to this.)

Thus, my question here is this--when exactly, if ever, do you think that we will be able to successfully change people's gender identity (on a *completely* voluntary basis, obviously)?

Also, to clarify--I myself certainly *don't* care whether or not other people would utilize such technology if it is ever developed; rather, my primary interest in such technology is personal.

 My question is this--would Hillary Clinton be running for U.S. President in 2016 if U.S. President Barack Obama would not have picked her as his Secretary of State (which in turn would have caused her to remain in the U.S. Senate) and if Obama would have picked a younger and less gaffe-prone VP such as Evan Bayh or Tim Kaine?

 In regards to this contraceptive testosterone gel:

http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/block-that-sperm/384971/

"A testosterone gel: The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is nearing a second round of clinical trials of a hormonal gel that men are directed to rub daily on their shoulders (a place thats not too hairy and not too sweaty, the NICHDs Diana Blithe told me). The gel contains Nestorone, a synthetic progestin that, by inhibiting testosterone production, stops the testicles from making sperm. The drug would also deliver testosterone to the blood, in an effort to prevent any change in libido, ejaculation, or muscle mass. Blithe says she hopes the gel will make for an appealing alternative to vasectomies and condoms."

I've got a question--other than the fact that it is presumably temporary and presumably capable of failure, how exactly, if at all, is this contraceptive testosterone gel *meaningfully* different from physical/surgical castration plus testosterone replacement therapy? Maybe I am totally missing something here, but the only *meaningful* differences between these two things which I see are the fact that this gel is presumably reversible and the fact that this gel is presumably capable of failure.

Any thoughts on this? Is my analysis of this spot-on, or am I completely missing something here?

Also, Yes, this is certainly a completely serious question. :) Also, I am certainly *not* trying to provoke anyone here; rather, I am simply trying to learn more information myself. :) 




 Let's have Al Gore officially win in 2000 by winning Florida by several hundred or several thousand votes as a result of George W. Bush saying a(n additional) stupid remark shortly before the 2000 election.

In this scenario, what exactly does U.S. foreign policy look like from 2001 to the present-day?

As for my own thoughts on this, here you go:

Al Gore (U.S. President between 2001 and 2009):

-9/11 still occurs due to the fact that, as far as I know, at least some of the issues (such as various U.S. intelligence agencies failing to sufficiently work with each other) which failed to prevent 9/11 would have still existed in this scenario.

-After 9/11, Gore would have still invaded Afghanistan due to the Taliban refusing to accept all of the conditions in his post-9/11 ultimatum to them. After helping the Northern Alliance overthrow the Taliban, the U.S. would have successfully killed Osama Bin Laden. However, after Bin Laden's death, Al-Qaeda would still continue to exist and to function with new leadership (but would gradually become weakened over time). Hamid Karzai is still installed as the new President of Afghanistan in this scenario, and while there is much more of a U.S. and Western focus on Afghanistan in this scenario, a lot of the issues which affected the Western war effort in Afghanistan in real life would have still been present in this scenario. Thus, I suspect that the U.S. will eventually lose its patience in Afghanistan in this scenario (and earlier than in real life) and thus eventually push for the creation of a Northern Alliance-"reformed" Taliban unity government in Afghanistan with a small long-lasting Western troop presence in Afghanistan in order to help keep the peace there. Whether the U.S. and the West (as in, the other NATO countries) will succeed in regards to doing this is anybody's guess.

-Gore does *not* invade Iraq due to the fact that he does *not* have a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein like Bush Jr. did. Rather, Gore exploits the aftermath of 9/11 to fully restore the sanctions regime on Iraq and to keep a close eye on Saddam Hussein.

-Gore successfully pursues a rapprochement with Iran due to their mutual hostility to the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and Saddam Hussein. Gore views a U.S. rapprochement with Iran as a useful tool to help stabilize Afghanistan and to put additional pressure on Saddam Hussein.

-Without an Iraq War, Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi takes longer to pursue a rapprochement with the West. However, 9/11 helps gradually push Gaddafi and the West closer together, which in turn results in Gaddafi fully renouncing terrorism and giving up all of his WMDs and his nuclear weapons program sometime in Gore's second term (2005-2009).

-There are more U.S.-Israel tensions in the early 2000s than there was in real life due to the fact that Gore, unlike Bush, doesn't fully support *all* of the anti-terrorism actions which Israel conducts during the Second Intifada. After Arafat's death and the second of the Second Intifada, however, U.S. and Israeli relations become warmer and Gore unsuccessfully makes a push for Israeli-Palestinian peace which fails due to Ehud Olmert's 2008 or 2009 resignation as a result of corruption allegations against him.

-Gore *might* militarily intervene in order to stop the genocide in Darfur, perhaps with the help of NATO; however, I am certainly *not* completely sure about this.

-North Korea probably does *not* build a nuclear weapon as early as it did in real life due to the fact that Gore, unlike Bush, would probably *not* be unequivocally hostile to North Korea.

-Without the Iraq War, U.S. relations with Europe would be better and warmer than they were under the Bush Administration in real life.

Some Republican (maybe someone such as George Allen; U.S. President between 2009 and 2017):

-Once the Arab Spring occurs, the U.S. and NATO still overthrow Muammar Gaddafi's regime in Libya. Likewise, NATO (including the U.S.) and Iran launch a joint large-scale military operation/campaign to overthrow Saddam Hussein during the Arab Spring due to the fact that the Arab Spring provides a good opportunity to do this. Afterwards, Iraq either gets partitioned into two or three separate countries or becomes a semi-functioning Shiite-led democracy which gives large autonomy to its various ethnic groups and regions. However, the process of stabilizing Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein could take a while, just like it did in real life.

-Likewise, the U.S. provides a large amount of assistance (including lethal military aid) to both opponents of Assad's regime in Syria and to the Ukrainian government (who are fighting against Russian-supported rebels in Eastern Ukraine). In turn, this results in Assad eventually getting overthrown in Syria and to a more difficult fight for Russia in Ukraine but one which Russia nevertheless still manages to eventually "win".

-The U.S. is no more successful at making peace between Israel and the Palestinians between 2009 and 2017 in this scenario than it was either under Bill Clinton or under Al Gore.

-North Korea withdraws from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and successfully builds and tests nuclear weapons sometime between 2009 and 2017.

Anyway, what exactly am I forgetting to list/state here?

Also, does anyone have any thoughts in regards to any of this? 




 Both make Jews run faster!

(Sorry, but as an agnostic Jew myself, I hope that it's okay for me to make this joke.) 




 For the record, I myself say Yes due to the fact that Pakistan will be unable to ever get a better offer than this and due to the fact that this will allow Pakistan to spend *much* less on defense and thus *much* more on improving the lives of its population. 




 Both make Jews run faster!

(Sorry, but as an agnostic Jew myself, I hope that it's okay for me to make this joke.) 




 that she went to the funeral naked! 




 OK--basically, I (the OP here) am a 22-year-old gender-fluid/cross-dreaming male who would like to get castrated (Yes, castrated, as in getting my testicles removed) and is willing to do whatever it takes in order to get this done.

Now, why exactly do I want to get castrated? Well, first of all, I would like to get sterilized in a way which cannot ever fail (after all of the remaining sperm in my body already die off, that is). Vasectomies can fail, all other available contraceptives can fail, and as for Vasalgel, it is way too untested for me. Plus, I have never heard anyone give me an extremely good reason as for why exactly Vasalgel is incapable of ever failing. The fact that Vasalgel hasn't failed yet doesn't necessarily mean that it will never fail for anyone; after all, I would think that vasectomies likewise had a 100% effectiveness rate before the first historical vasectomy failure actually occurred.

Also, before anyone brings up the idea of me only having sex with women who share my own views in regards to pregnancy, I would like to point out that I would never rely on any woman's word that she will get an abortion (or give our hypothetical future offspring for adoption, for that matter); after all, a woman can simply change her mind on this later on.

Also, abstaining from vaginal sex with all fertile and potentially fertile women for the rest of my life is likewise both completely unrealistic and completely unacceptable for me.

Thus, I have to take matters into my own hands and seek out castration (Yes, castration, as in the removal of both of my testicles) by any means necessary. Afterwards, I will need to utilize hormone replacement therapy in order to deal with the less pleasant effects of castration.

Also, I would like to point out that I would like to regulate my sex drive and that, as a gender-fluid/cross-dreaming person, I might very well want to take female hormones after my planned castration if I am still (somehow) able to indefinitely get erections (using my penis, which I intend to keep indefinitely) afterwards. I mean, the idea of me becoming a six-foot-tall beauty strongly appeals to me, and not in a sexual way. Indeed, whenever I shave my face, I am always reminded of just how incredibly beautiful of a (trans-)woman I would make. :) However, at the same time, just to be safe, I want to keep all of my options open in regards to which hormone replacement therapy I should take after my planned castration (Yes, castration).

Anyway, what I am wondering is if anyone who is either a eunuch or a trans-woman can give me my advice in regards to utilizing hormone replacement therapy (either kind) and in regards to living a life without gonads in general. In addition, I would also like to hear about the sex lives of eunuchs, specifically in regards to erections, orgasm, et cetera, since this information is certainly of personal interest to me. Also, if anyone has any additional information which I might be interested in, then please don't hesitate to share this information with me!

Also, one more question--exactly how long will I need to wait after castration in order to be completely sure that all of the remaining sperm in my body are already dead?

And Yes, if anyone has any doubts in regards to this, this is certainly a completely serious post. 




 After all, the money from this sale can be used to help finance Syria's reconstruction after its years-long civil war.

Thoughts on this? 




 For the record, I am personally going to say No because I expect another recession to begin in the U.S. sometime between 2018 and 2020, which in turn will result in Hillary Clinton either losing reelection in 2020 or not seeking reelection in the first place. After all, an economy can't keep growing non-stop forever. 




 What exactly are your thoughts on this wedding song?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FULXLzn4Gl0

(Love of My Life - The Wedding Song by Darla Day)

Personally, as someone who is a Pastafarian on my good days and an agnostic on my bad days, I strongly like this wedding song despite its religious tones. After all, it just sounds so beautiful and wonderful! :)

Also, while I myself am too young to get married, say, within the next decade, I might decide to use this wedding song when I will eventually get married (if my future wife will be okay with it, that is). After all, the references to "God" in this song can certainly be interpreted as references to the Pastafarian God. ;)

 I myself am pro-choice, but I tend to view things from both sides in order to see where exactly one is coming from.

That said--do you agree with the statement above? 




 Back when I was in middle school, I had a very tall teacher named Richard; looking back, I should have called him Big Dick. Also, it is worth noting that Big Dick was hard but pleasurable and that all of the teachers at my former middle school liked Big Dick. As of right now, Big Dick is currently the assistant principal at that very same middle school; thus, one can certainly be surprised as how far Big Dick can go. ;)

Also, before anyone brings up the idea of me only having sex with women who share my own views in regards to pregnancy, I would like to point out that I would never rely on any woman's word that she will get an abortion (or give our hypothetical future offspring for adoption, for that matter); after all, a woman can simply change her mind on this later on.

Also, abstaining from vaginal sex with all fertile and potentially fertile women for the rest of my life is likewise both completely unrealistic and completely unacceptable for me.

Thus, I have to take matters into my own hands and seek out castration (Yes, castration, as in the removal of both of my testicles) by any means necessary. Afterwards, I will need to utilize hormone replacement therapy in order to deal with the less pleasant effects of castration.

Also, I would like to point out that I would like to regulate my sex drive and that, as a gender-fluid/cross-dreaming person, I might very well want to take female hormones after my planned castration if I am still (somehow) able to indefinitely get erections (using my penis, which I intend to keep indefinitely) afterwards. I mean, the idea of me becoming a six-foot-tall beauty strongly appeals to me, and not in a sexual way. However, at the same time, just to be safe, I want to keep all of my options open in regards to which hormone replacement therapy I should take after my planned castration (Yes, castration).

Anyway, what I am wondering is if anyone who is either a eunuch or a trans-woman can give me my advice in regards to utilizing hormone replacement therapy (either kind) and in regards to living a life without gonads in general. In addition, I would also like to hear about the sex lives of eunuchs, specifically in regards to erections, orgasm, et cetera, since this information is certainly of personal interest to me. Also, if anyone has any additional information which I might be interested in, then please don't hesitate to share this information with me!

Also, one more question--exactly how long will I need to wait after castration in order to be completely sure that all of the remaining sperm in my body are already dead?

And Yes, if anyone has any doubts in regards to this, this is certainly a completely serious post. 


































 What exactly would have happened afterwards? How exactly would the history of Israel over the last seven years have been different?

Any thoughts on this? 




 What exactly would have happened afterwards? How exactly would the history of Israel over the last seven years have been different?

Any thoughts on this? 




  First of all. Welcome to the subreddit, Israeli friend. I would like to first acknowledge that I wish Pakistan recognizes Israel and establishes diplomatic ties, as this is probably the sanest thing to do, considering the Arabs have never spoken a word for Pakistan's Kashmir dispute.

Great to hear! :) Also, for the record, one can recognize Israel without supporting all of Israel's policies.

The BBC offers scenarios of possible solutions to the conflict: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/south_asia/03/kashmir_future/html/default.stm

Yes, I saw that BBC page before. :)

I am of Kashmiri heritage.

OK.

The Kashmiris are a muslim majority nation, and are only in India because of Maharaja Hari Singh's (a hindu) decision to join India, with complete disregard to the views of the Muslim masses living in his state, who wanted to join Pakistan.

As far as I know, though, Hari Singh only chose to join India due to the fact that Pashtun forces from Pakistan had already invaded Kashmir by that point in time.

India's PM at the time, Nehru, promised the Kashmiris that their right of self-determination will be met, and "India is not fond of forced marriages". Unfortunately, that promise was not kept.

Well, if Pakistan would have been willing to withdraw all of its troops from Kashmir in the late 1940s and/or in the early 1950s, then maybe a U.N.-sponsored plebiscite would have occurred in Kashmir.

Let me assure you, most Kashmiris today either desire independence or to join Pakistan - and they do not want to join India. And they do not want the LoC to remain a border between their nation.

Well, at the very least, I will say that a majority of the people in the Kashmir Valley almost certainly prefer independence.

An internationally-monitored referendum should be held in Kashmir, with 3 choices: 1. Independence from both nations. 2. Join Pak. 3. Join India.

That would have been great, especially back in 1947 before the British left.

However, it might be both too late and a bad move to hold such a referendum in Kashmir right now:

http://www.rediff.com/news/report/eu/20070306.htm

India will never allow this because Kashmiris will most likely opt for independence or merger with Pakistan. Merger with India WILL NOT happen. I assure you. So I will discuss only 2 scenarios that are most likely to happen.

Well, there is also the matter that, as far as I know, any territorial changes to India require an amendment to the Indian Constitution.

Scenario 1: Independence. Kashmiris from Pakistan and India unite to form a nation. Their flag will be very similar to Pakistan, and their national language will be Urdu, just like Pakistan (most Kashmiris are Urdu speakers). They will form a state very similar to Pakistan and Afghanistan. Over the course of decades and centuries, eventually this landlocked nation will join very close ties with its more culturally-close and religiously native neighbour, Pakistan. They will be so interlinked, that I can predict that within a 100 years of Kashmiri independence there will be a merger with Pakistan or form a very very close relationship, a defensive or economic union.

Good luck getting India to agree to this, though.

Scenario 2: Pakistan merger. Personally, I want this to occur. But I would like Jammu to stay with India since they are majority Hindu and don't want to merge with Pakistan. If this scenario is to occur, it should be everything north of River Chenab to join Pakistan, and below to join India.

I don't think that the people in either the Kashmir Valley or Ladakh (which I think is Buddhist-majority) want to join Pakistan, though. Heck, the people in Ladakh might prefer Indian rule instead.

Also, for the record, my solution here isn't meant to be fair. Rather, it is meant to be realistic. If there is a way to restore the 1947 demographic situation in all of Kashmir, then maybe, just maybe a plebiscite should occur. However, I am unsure if this is possible to do; after all, how good was record-keeping in Kashmir back in 1947? 




 Two questions:

1. How many people in India and Pakistan are able to prove their ancestors' place of residence back in 1947?

2. Didn't Pakistan allow many people from other parts of the country to settle in Kashmir after 1947? 




  I know you meant this as a "realistic" solution, but I think your bias is showing.

Well, like it or not, but realities aren't always pleasant.

In every option you gave, it's either "have Pakistan recognise this", "have Pakistan recognise that",

Yes; correct!

not to mention the joke about India paying an "extremely tiny" bit of compensation to Pakistan for the Siachen glacier (that was a joke, right?).

No, it wasn't; rather, it was a serious proposal. After all, why exactly should India give Pakistan a lot of money in compensation for a glacier where no one lives?

Though you may have been sincere in that suggestion, there's no amount of money India could ever offer Pakistan to withdraw it's claim to disputed territory.

Even to a glacier where no one lives?

It's unrealistic to think Pakistan would accept such an offer anyway.

Then I don't think that you will be able to have peace with India.

 The most realistic (and fair) way is like /u/GuyOnToilet said, to hold a referendum in Kashmir (with UN oversight) and allow the Kashmiris to decide their future,

Didn't Pakistan, unlike India, allow people from other parts of the country to settle in its part of Kashmir after 1947, though? If so, then such a referendum might be unfair to India.

(However, I will admit that such a referendum *should* have been held back in 1947, before the British left.)

whether India would respect the result of such a referendum is another issue entirely, they certainly didn't when it came to Junagadh.

Weren't the referendum results in Junagadh extremely strongly *in favor* of India, though? 




 For the record, I myself am certainly *not* a Pakistani. In fact, I don't think that Pakistan even recognizes my birth country (Israel). Thus, to accuse me of being biased in favor of Pakistan here would be ludicrous. 




 If they don't like it, and they can, you know, move (back) to Israel. 




 No, she isn't. :) 




 Huh? 




 In other words, a pharmacist. 




 Huh? 




 This woman needs a lot of jail time, a lot of mental health treatment, or both of these things. :( 




 I normally hate Assad's guts, but in this specific case, I will say this:

Way to go Assad! :) Keep it coming! :) Woot woot! :) 




 That would ideally be great, but the problem is that, as far as I know, not everyone who or whose family left Kashmir after 1947 would be able to prove that they previously lived in Kashmir. 




  It's sad these people will have children

This *can* certainly be dealt with, though. ;) 




 Donald Rumsfeld and Saddam Hussein in 1983--BFFs for sure:

 Also, what about non-binary people? Or does Iran not recognize non-binary gender identities? 




 This might give Pakistan an unfair advantage, though. After all, as far as I know, Pakistan, unlike India, *did* change the demographics of its part of Kashmir after 1947-1948. 




 Sexist Persians. :( 




 Why *isn't* this funny? 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Homo ... erectus. ;) 




 No, but they did a lot of other bullshit back then. :( 




 And yet we are supposed to be fighting for freedom and women's rights there. :( 




 Unfortunately some Muslim countries are still even more backwards than Hell is. :( What a shame and a tragedy. :( 




 Well, at least Russia respects the U.S. :) That's certainly a good start. :) 




 To the Jewish Ice Cream Taste Question. ;) 




 Nazi ice cream! ;) Run for your lives! ;) 




 Yep. :) 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 I am sorry, but can you please rephrase what you said here? 
























 Any thoughts on this? 




 Yes, some of them do. 




 Well, if necessary, Israel and/or someone else can use force in order to achieve this goal. 




 Also, though, for the record, there *is* another solution which India can try doing in regards to this, but it can get *extremely* nasty:

1. Have India propose my solution for Kashmir to Pakistan.
2. When Pakistan refuses, have India eliminate Kashmir's autonomy and encourage large-scale immigration of Hindus to Kashmir, especially to the Kashmir Valley.
3. If Pakistan responds to this by increasing its support of terrorism, then have India begin supporting terrorist groups inside of Pakistan (such as the Pakistani Taliban and Baluch separatists).
4. When Pakistan will complain about India changing the demographics of Kashmir, point out that Pakistan's friend and ally China is doing the same thing in Xinjiang and that Pakistan always appears to have been quiet about this.
5. Offer to restore Kashmir's autonomy if Pakistan agrees to recognize both the Line of Control and the Line of Actual Control (on the Siachen Glacier) as the permanent international border between India and Pakistan.

There--how exactly is that (other than *extremely* nasty, obviously)? 




  The nations that would be acceptable to both- Scandinavian countries, etc.- are not nations that have traditionally looked to be international peacebrokers at all, let alone in South Asia. The only exception is France, and even then the French limit their international role to their former colonies (primarily West Africa).

Then bribe the French to agree to do this.

 I'm not sure it would, as those factions (e.g., military) looking for total control of Kashmir would see such an action as strengthening the case for the LoC to become the border, thus weakening their stance.

It might be hard for them to effectively make this argument considering that Pakistan has already agreed to the Simla Agreement more than 40 years ago, though. After all, the Simla Agreement states that neither India nor Pakistan will use force to solve the Kashmir dispute and that neither India nor Pakistan will go beyond the Line of Control.

 Oh okay, I'd though you meant to use them as an example- African forces (it seems to be mostly Ethiopia and Rwanda) that act as Peacekeepers may work on the small scale in Africa (which is where they tend to be deployed), but a mission to Kashmir would be far, far more internationally high-profile, would demand far more manpower, and would be fundamentally different from their standard role, which is prevention of civil wars in Africa.

 I'm not sure African nations would commit to troops in Kashmir- quasi-state-sponsored, seasoned partisans are not the same as African warlord guerrillas.

What about if African nations are bribed enough (as in, given enough money) to agree to this, though? Would that work for this?

 I agree, but unfortunately that's not something achievable with diplomacy.

Agreed, unfortunately. :(

 Would this necessarily be a bad thing in the long(er)-run, though? 




 Maybe, but if the U.S. and/or someone else will succeed in removing *all* of Pakistan's nuclear weapons in time, then this civil war might not be that catastrophic and might actually (and ironically) result in some good in the long(er)-run. 




 Yes, this appears to be accurate. Of course, with my proposal, UN peacekeepers would need to be the ones who will be manning the borders.

Also, though, I would like to point out that if one can resolve the Kashmir dispute in a mutually agreeable way *without* holding a plebiscite there, then one can get rid of the plebiscite part of my solution to the Kashmir dispute. The purpose of the plebiscite in my solution to this was to give civilian Pakistani politicians a way to save face so that they could not be accused of making peace with India at the expense of the Kashmiri people. 




  Part of their traditional neutrality is that they definitely don't do this kind of thing- they keep to themselves.

In that case, though, what about Sweden or France? Also, Norway or Iceland might work for this as well, as might Austria. Any thoughts on this? After all, there must be *some* country which would be willing to do this and which would be acceptable to both India and Pakistan.

No problem! The issue then is that the original Step 3 (greater interaction/trade) wouldn't be possible as a means of getting a border resolution, as Step 3 would itself need a border resolution to happen.

Actually, I might know a compromise in regards to this: Pakistan might provisionally recognize the Line of Control as the permanent boundary between India and Pakistan (just like West Germany did with the Oder-Neisse Line in 1970) but reserve the right to withdraw this recognition afterwards. Meanwhile, a final Pakistani recognition of the Line of Control as the permanent boundary between India and Pakistan will only occur after a favorable result in the plebiscite which I mentioned (similarly, Germany gave final recognition to the Oder-Neisse Line in either 1990 or in 1991).

There--would that work for this?

Arbitration already works poorly enough in Africa, which can't harm western militaries without guerilla tactics. Pakistan has nukes and India is a rising superpower- this is a whole different ballgame.

Actually, I was talking about using African troops for a U.N. peacekeeping mission to Kashmir. I just want to clarify this part in order to make sure that you understood my point here correctly.

The issue is that the military faction wouldn't let the plebiscite happen at all precisely because of this.

Then have the Pakistanis launch a revolution or something against the military faction in Pakistan. After all, without this, there can probably never be a mutually acceptable peace between India and Pakistan. 




 Yeah--please say whatever you want to say in regards to this. 




 I recently thought about what exactly my ideal solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be (this is a conflict which is of large personal interest to me due to the fact that I myself was born in Israel and still have Israeli citizenship right now).

Anyway:

-All Israeli settlements in the West Bank which are located near the border with Israel will be placed under Israeli sovereignty.

-All of the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem will remain under Israeli sovereignty.

-The Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem will have completely free and fair sovereignty referendums/plebiscites held there, with the final border in Jerusalem being drawn as closely as possible according to the results of these referendums/plebiscites.

-The Old City of Jerusalem would either be divided or become an international zone, with freedom of worship for all.

-The Palestinian refugees would be unable to return to Israel proper but they would be able to settle in the new Palestinian state. However, it would also be nice if these Palestinian refugees would get the option of remaining in the Arab countries where some of them are currently living and to acquire citizenship and full, equal rights in these Arab countries.

-The Palestinian state would need to be fully demilitarized; it will be allowed to have a police force to maintain order, but not an army.

-*All* terrorist organizations should be *fully/completely* disarmed, with this being verified by neutral observers.

-It would be nice if the Palestinians (with the help of the international community) bought the northeastern part of the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt in order to expand the Gaza Strip and thus help deal with the overpopulation which is currently occurring in the Gaza Strip.

-Israeli settlers who will end up in the new Palestinian state should be allowed to remain there if they agree to fully respect all Palestinian laws and to become Palestinian citizens. They will be able to keep their Israeli citizenship if they want, though.

-The Palestinian state will receive territorial compensation of equal area and as much equal quality as possible for the areas of the West Bank which Israel will annex/keep.

-*All* incitement on both sides might stop and be made illegal.

Am I missing anything here?

Also, how exactly does this list look? 




 Yes, I do. 




  Well that's a good thought. But waiting for decades doesn't seems like the solution. About 15 years should be enough.

Yes, 15 or 20 years might be good enough for this. However, if the first plebiscite in regards to this fails, then there will need to be another plebiscite in regards to this at some future point in time.

 And some patriotic Indians will all cry on this thread. They don't think about humanity but fulfill their own selfishness.

Why, though? After all, my solution here is *not* going to cause India to lose *any* of its territory. 




 Yes, Step #3 here is certainly crucial. However, all of the steps in my solution will need to be fulfilled in order for a permanent peace to be achieved between India and Pakistan. :)

Also, in regards to Russia, I don't think that its problems have as much to do with it still being in land-grabbing mode as with the fact that there is still a lot of corruption and a lot of dependence on natural resources for Russia's economy growth and prosperity. 




  Pakistan is a 'US ally'- there's no way the State Dept. would ever put itself in the position to potentially internationally arbitrate that Pakistan supports terrorists.

Very good point; thus, what about Switzerland? Would Switzerland work for this?

Except that would involve basically a massive political change/revolution in Pakistan, if not an invasion (... as in 1945 Germany).

Agreed.

Somewhere between India and Pakistan there needs to be a point at which people cross the economic border and are subject to import laws. This means one of two things needs to happen:

1. India and Pakistan set up a customs border along the line of control... which would be a de facto international border, which is really what the whole crisis is about in the first place.

2. India and Pakistan both treat the whole Kashmir region as outside their national borders, meaning people could move freely within Kashmir but would need to cross a border to enter India or Pakistan.

Thanks for clarifying this part. In this case, your suggestion #1 would be the one which needs to be implemented.

They would probably help with the vote itself, but a vote of this magnitude would have a massive danger of violence and tampering attached. You'd need UN Peacekeeping troops, and I don't know what country would willingly supply them.

What about some African countries, though?

I don't think it would- a vote in favor of India would be a massive slap in the face to the nationalistic and military factions in Pakistan.

Yes, it might be a slap in the face to them, but it will allow moderate Pakistani civilian politicians to save face by arguing that Pakistan didn't make peace with India at the expense of the Kashmiri people. 




 Good luck with that, though. After all, Pakistan already has *a lot* of nuclear weapons. 




 Does a country need to withdraw all of its forces from a particular area for a plebiscite to take place, though? In other words, would the U.N. be able to keep peace, quiet, and order in Kashmir if *zero* Pakistani and Indian forces were placed there at the time of this plebiscite?

Also, for the record, this plebiscite is meant to allow Pakistan to save face in regards to recognizing both the Line of Control and the Line of Actual Control (on the Siachen Glacier) as the permanent international border between India and Pakistan. 




 Well, if my first step here is not going to be fulfilled, then I don't think that one can have a mutually agreeable solution to the Kashmir dispute. 




 OK--anyway, here is my solution to the Kashmir dispute. This solution is not meant to be the fairest, but rather the most realistic in regards to having it be accepted by both India and Pakistan:

Step 1: Have Pakistan withdraw all of its support for Kashmiri terrorists and insurgents.

Step 2: Have both India and Pakistan (somewhat) reduce their military presence in Kashmir.

Step 3: Allow greater interaction, trade, and cooperation between Indian-controlled Kashmir and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir.

Step 4: After at least a couple of decades, hold a plebiscite in both Indian-controlled Kashmir and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir which asks the residents there if they approve of making the current situation in Kashmir permanent as well as in making the Line of Control the permanent international border between India and Pakistan.

Step 5: If this plebiscite is approved by voters in both parts of Kashmir, then have Pakistan recognize the Line of Control as the permanent international border between India and Pakistan. If this plebiscite is rejected by at least one of the sides, then seek an alternative formula for Kashmir, very possibly along at least somewhat similar lines.

Step 6: Have Pakistan agree to make the Line of Actual Control on the Siachen Glacier the permanent international border between India and Pakistan. Since this will give India permanent sovereignty at least most of the Siachen Glacier, India will pay an [b]extremely[/b] tiny amount of compensation to Pakistan in order for Pakistan to save face in regards to this.

Step 7: Have India and Pakistan make love rather than war. ;)

There--how exactly is all of that? 




  It'd be great if this happened, but:
 Pakistan will claim it already doesn't support them, so there would have to be some sort of third-party judgement by an agreed-upon arbitrator as to whether Pakistan supports terrorists or not (and what 'support' means). I don't think any country, or the UN, would put itself in that position.

How about the U.S., though?

Also, without an end to terrorism and to the Kashimiri insurgency, I don't see it being advantageous to India to open up Kashmir's borders. After all, this could allow more insurgents and terrorists to come to India, and India certainly doesn't want that.

 Kashmir is pretty much all their respective militaries do, and I don't know much about India's but Pakistan's has massive political power- they thrive off border tensions, and I can't see why they'd agree to a lessening of force.

I would presume that the role of Pakistan's military in this scenario would need to be decreased (similar to how the German military's role significantly decreased after 1945).

 How? Where is the customs border?

I am sorry, but can you please elaborate on this part?

Would each country be forced to treat their respective national 'borders' with the entire Kashmir contested region as international boundaries?

Yes, they would.

Also, how does this consider deliberate settlement to skew demographics for the future plebiscite?

How about only allowing those people who or whose ancestors lived in Kashmir in 1947 (or at some other year) to vote in this plebiscite? Would that work?

 Again, a vote would need to be run by an agreed-upon international third party arbitrator.

How about having the U.N. monitor this vote, then?

In this case, I don't think it would happen, seeing as I don't think either country really cares what the residents' opinion on the matter is.

Yes, you might very well be correct on this, though Pakistan has frequently voiced support for the aspirations of the Kashmiris. Of course, voicing support for this is different from actually supporting the aspirations of the Kashimiris.

Anyway, though, this plebiscite will allow Pakistan to save face in regards to this. 




 OK--anyway, here is my solution to the Kashmir dispute. This solution is not meant to be the fairest, but rather the most realistic in regards to having it be accepted by both India and Pakistan:

 Unfortunately, it is not completely original. 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Yes, I know that I am hastily generalizing here, but my point here is still a valid one, especially when comparing science-minded people with, say, Young Earth Creationists. 




 Can I just buy something with these $10 instead, though? 




 I am sorry about your anxiety in regards to this. :( Ideally, transgender people shouldn't feel compelled to remain in the closet.

Also, thank you very much for this information about bottom surgery. I've got a question, though--can't a penis pump significantly help with getting erections and whatnot?

In addition, exactly how much does your testosterone replacement therapy cost? Also, did you experience any unpleasant consequences/side effects of taking testosterone, or has your experience with testosterone so far been fully pleasant? 




 Also, out of curiosity, exactly how much does your testosterone replacement therapy cost? 




 What exactly does a meta stand for, though?

Also, how exactly do you deal with any possible unpleasant consequences of testosterone replacement therapy (such as an increased cancer risk)? Serious question, for the record.

In addition, how exactly did your emotions and personality change before and after you began taking testosterone? 




 Transphobes are certainly vile scum, but I thought that money itself does not have any views. After all, the recipient of a monetary donation gets to decide what to do with this donation, correct?

Also, since the Girl Scouts are returning this money, should Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation likewise return all of the money that she and it received from misogynistic and homophobic countries? Serious question, for the record.

Any thoughts on this? 




 I suppose that the mentality in regards to doing this is "Better safe than sorry." 




 This question is certainly not meant to offend anyone; rather, I am simply very curious about this: If you are a trans-man and got rid of your gonads, got a penis, and/or are using testosterone replacement therapy, then what exactly is this experience like for you? Is dealing with things such as testosterone replacement therapy pretty easy? Are you pleased with the functioning of your penises (if you already have penises, that is)?

Any thoughts on any of this? 




  Jesus they take 5 cm!!

Yes--at least, that's what I heard. 




  Wow. If you don't mind sharing, why?

Because all non-drastic methods of contraception and sterilization appear to be capable of failure and because castration plus female hormones might end up being very useful for things such as feminizing my face as well as reducing my sex drive.

I can't imagine myself being in a situation where I would even consider those options unless my life was threatened

Well, you appear to be more tolerant of the risk of an unplanned pregnancy and its consequences than I am (assuming that you are a cis-man, of course). Plus, I am presuming that you, unlike myself, don't cross-dream, correct? 




 No; heck, if anything, vasectomy is actually pretty mild in comparison to what I intend to do (castration/orchiectomy).

Rather, I am simply curious to hear if there have been any known cases of what exactly I am talking about here. 




 If so, then I would please like to hear your story. :) 




 No problem! :) 




 Can't a judge state that one part of the U.S. Constitution overrides an earlier part of the U.S. Constitution, though? 




 Congratulations to the Kurds! :) Hopefully their success in regards to ISIS will continue! :) 









 Maybe you are correct on this; I am not completely sure.

However, I did previously see an article in what appears to be a legal journal which argues in favor of having a court ruling get rid of the natural-born U.S. citizen requirement for the U.S. Presidency:

http://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287 context=lawreview

Any thoughts on this article? 




 In such a case, I would be skeptical of their claims, but I would still like to hear them out. 



















 You can't hear numbers. ;) 




 Not in French, you can't. ;) 




 Thank you very much for sharing all of this information. :) 




  At the time the constitution was written, the founders only had to look back a few years to King George I, whose lack of apparent interest in England and commitment to Hanover could serve as a reminder.

OK.

But I recall a more recent example of a head of state of Germany who expended a great deal of energy attempting, with success, to annex his natal country. Needless to say, it didn't end well.

It didn't end well, but this was a result of Hitler being a poor decision-maker--not the result of Hitler being a naturalized German citizen. 




  Not to my knowledge, but how many countries allow foreign-born people to run for President? Isn't that a fairly common restriction in many democracies?

Actually, I don't think that this is the case in most European democracies.

For example, Mexico requires not only that you be a natural-born citizen, but that at least one of your parents are as well. They also require that you not be an official of any church, nor be currently serving the in military.

I would suspect that any country that based their democracy off of the US model would have similar requirements.

Yes, but this doesn't appear to apply to the democracies in the "Old World." 




 I've got a question, though--can't this requirement be gotten rid of by a court ruling as well? As in, some activist judge finds something within the U.S. Constitution which he or she claims overrules the natural-born U.S. citizen requirement in the U.S. Constitution.

Any thoughts on this? 




 In other words, religious people can have an excuse for everything.

Any thoughts on this? 




 Also, for the record, the question of mine which you quoted here still has a lot of merit. *Have* there ever been any such cases (in any country)? 




  When the Constitution was written, it was pretty common to marry into the ruling family of another country and use that as leverage to take over. That was pretty much the standard operating procedure of European politics for hundreds of years.

Sure, but the U.S. wasn't a monarchy even back in the late 1700s.

 The original intent of this clause was to prevent someone like King George (or a French/Austrian/Spanish king) from running for and winning the presidency of the newly founded American democracy, thus returning to European rule. Remember, a monarchy would have very, very deep pockets to fund an election in the colonies if they tried it (much greater than any competitor).

Yes, I think that you are correct in regards to this.

This wasn't outside the realm of possibility in 1783.

Agreed.

I don't believe the original intent was primarily xenophobic or discriminatory as we'd consider those terms today.

The original intent? Very possibly not, but nowadays this part of the U.S. Constitution is very much xenophobic and discriminatory.

 While I think there is merit to discussing whether we still need such a protection today,

If so, then I am interested in hearing your thoughts on this. :)

I'd disagree with your assertion that it had little to no value in the past.

Did I ever outright say that, though? What I think I said was that it outlived whatever value it ever had in the past. In other words, I did not say whether or not it had any value in the past; rather, what I said is that regardless of the answer to this question, this requirement has no value today. 




 Yes, I think that you are correct in regards to this. :) 




 My view on this is is pretty simple:

The "natural-born U.S. citizen" requirement for the U.S. Presidency should be eliminated. It is xenophobic, discriminatory, treats naturalized U.S. citizens as second-class citizens, outlived whatever value it ever had, and creates a slippery slope.

In regards to the value of this requirement, let me ask one this--have there ever been any cases of naturalized citizens democratically coming to power in a particular country and then betraying their adopted country's interests in favor of their birth country's interests? Also, Adolf Hitler certainly does *not* qualify for this, considering that Hitler did not sacrifice Germany's interests in favor of Austria's interests; if anything, he got rid of the independence of his birth country (Austria) and allowed his adopted country (Germany) to annex his birth country.

As for the slippery slope part, I would like to point out that, as far as I know, a similar rationale which is used to deny naturalized U.S. citizens the U.S. Presidency was previously used to justify the forced internment of Japanese-Americans (a majority of whom I think were U.S. citizens) during World War II. Likewise, a similar paranoia existed in some Americans' minds when Roman Catholics Al Smith (in 1928) and JFK (in 1960) ran for the U.S. Presidency due to their fear that they would take orders from the Pope. This is what I meant in regards to the slippery slope part.

If a naturalized U.S. citizen who runs for the U.S. Presidency seems suspicious, then the American voters can simply not elect this candidate in the first place, just like they can avoid electing natural-born U.S. citizens who are running for the U.S. Presidency and who seem suspicious. However, in the name of equality, naturalized U.S. citizens should certainly be allowed to run for the U.S. Presidency just like naturalized citizens can already become the head of state and/or the head of government in many countries worldwide today. Plus, it is worth noting that many naturalized U.S. citizens could have been better U.S. Presidents than people such as George W. Bush actually were in real life. After all, naturalized U.S. citizens might appreciate the U.S. and U.S. citizenship more than natural-born U.S. citizens (some/many of whom might take it for granted) do.

Anyway, if someone wants to try changing my mind on this, then please do so.

 Who the Hell is Johna? 




 No, I don't. 














 In comparison to whom, exactly? 














 "She" meaning one's wife or one's wife's friend? I just want to clarify this part. 




 If so, though, then wouldn't that mean that he himself is (secretly) gay or bisexual? 




 Are you talking about this guy here? :

http://cdn-www.i-am-bored.com/media/thumbnails/carth.jpg 




 And if it isn't? 














 Before or after she cleans herself up, though? 









 Yep. ;) 














 http://rs2img.memecdn.com/isis-supports-gay-rights_o_4120639.jpg

Well, I can dream, can't I? ;) 




  That may have been a good clue.

And your statement here may have been the understatement of the year. ;) 




 What a shame! ;) After all, I already spent a lot of money on popcorn! ;) 














 Yes, I am aware of Israel's Law of Return. However, when I lived in Israel, I don't think that I was officially considered to be Jewish due to the religious definition of a Jew. 




 No, I don't think so. 




 Are you talking about this movie here? :

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_(film)

If so, then No. 




 Out of curiosity--what exactly do you mean by this? 




 This badass:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_von_Lettow-Vorbeck 




 Being Jewish according to Jewish law. 




 Any thoughts on this? 









 OK. Will do! :) 




 Yes; that was a typo on my part.

Should I create a new thread with the correct spelling, or what? 




 Can someone please fix my typo here? I obviously meant to write "Hungarian" instead of "Hugnarian" in my thread title here. 









 Thank you, Arnold! :) (not sarcasm) 




 What if German President Paul Von Hindenburg decided to retire in 1932 after Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck agrees to run in his place?

Would Lettow-Vorbeck have defeated Hitler in 1932? If so, then Hitler and the Nazis probably never come to power in Germany in the legal way considering that Lettow-Vorbeck very strongly hated Hitler's guts. However, since the Nazis cannot come to power in Germany legally in this scenario, do they attempt to launch a repeat of their 1923 coup attempt but on a much larger scale once the Nazis determine that their electoral support has probably already peaked? Also, do the German Communists attempt to launch their own coup in this scenario (with the support of the Soviet Union, of course)? Could Germany have descended into full-blown civil war (between the German government, the Nazis, and the Communists) in 1933 or 1934 in this scenario? If so, then how exactly does this German civil war turn out? Also, how does this German civil war affect the outcome of the 1935 Saar plebiscite?

Also, how exactly would Lettow-Vorbeck have handled the German economy as well as German foreign relations? Likewise, would Lettow-Vorbeck have ran for re-election in 1939? If so, then would he have won re-election in 1939?

In addition, how exactly would German history in the 1940s, 1950s, and beyond have developed in this scenario?

Any thoughts on any of this?

Also, for reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_von_Lettow-Vorbeck

 Nope; here is some reading for you to do:

http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/27/us/supreme-court-homosexual-rights-justices-6-3-legalize-gay-sexual-conduct.html 




  It's not really a lot of time, most of the time sex for me lasts a while. It's just foreplay.

Understood; thanks for clarifying this part.

I'm not even sure what that means lol. I'm me I guess hehe. I'm mtf trans and I'm just like ehh I'm done and I don't see it necessary to spend money on surgery I personally don't need.

What I meant was this--do you identify as female all of the time (as opposed to only a part of the time)? Serious question, for the record. 




 Nope, simply from a personally curious genderqueer person. 




  Umm it depends a lot on the mood I'm in, if I'm being actively aroused by someone, and if they are doing things that are particularly arousing. It's like asking herding cats a bit. So I can't really put a number on it, but I'll give a ROUND number of maybe like 30-45 minutes to get good and erect maybe?

That seems like a lot of time, though.

No I don't intend to. I like it where it is.

Understood; also, out of curiosity, do you yourself identify as a binary trans-woman? 




 Apologies for asking, but exactly how long do you concentrate before you can get an erection using your penis?

Also, out of pure curiosity, do you ever plan to get rid of your penis and to get a vagina in its place? 




 OK--this is a question which is of personal interest to me (Yes, I am completely, 100% serious in regards to this)--if a genderqueer person who is physically a eunuch (as in, this individual was born with a male body and then became a eunuch) takes female hormones for several years and then begins taking male hormones, then would he/she be able to get erections using his/her penis?

Any thoughts on this? 














 In your honest opinion, what exactly are the best all-you-can-eat buffets in Orange County, California?

The answer to this question is of personal interest to me considering that I myself live in SoCal and absolutely *love* food. :) 









 Any thoughts on this? 




 Any thoughts on this? 



















 After all, I myself love to eat, but I am also *extremely* open to the idea of me taking female hormones in the future. (Also, Yes, I have a lot of desires and issues that I need to deal with, as you can tell by my Reddit posting history.) Thus, is there any way for me to take female hormones and to still have a large metabolism afterwards?

Any thoughts on this? 







































 Maybe the McRib; I mean, just look at it:

http://grub.gunaxin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mcrib1.jpg

 




 Stewie Griffin from Family Guy?

After all, he was initially a matricidal-minded evil genius because he became a flaming gay drama queen. ;) 




 Because Xerkule previously used the word "men" rather than "male." 




 Either Jackass: The Movie or American Pie. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8iqEfje7Aw
 




 It *doesn't* detract from the point. 




 Good points. :) 




 Well, come on! After all, I *must* know this information! ;) You see, I'm an NSA agent and we're compiling a database of this information, so yeah. ;) 




 Yes; correct! 




  The quick and dirty way is to see who has a bigger, newer air force. modern jet fighters are imported and expensive and thus are a good barometer of how seriously the country in question is taking its defense spending. It is far from a perfect metric, and the thai airforce is a bit longer in the tooth than I would have expected, but on the whole it's very much superior.

Thanks for this info.

why would they want to?

Because Mongolia has a lot of natural resources?

Also, what about Russia conquering the Russian-majority parts of northern Kazakhstan in the event that Kazakhstan ever tries to, say, withdraw from the Eurasian Economic Union? 




 Just curious; after all, I want to compare your size to my own. :) #notcreepy 




 *All* the stupid people? Is Donald Trump from Florida? 




 So what *is* a statically relevant number? 




 Are you sure about that, though? 




 Israel doesn't commit terrorism, though. 




 South Carolina ... figures--those rednecks! :( 




 Why exactly were you worried about Florida, though? 




  You could arguably just call it american colonialism?

Why, though?

The situation just seems so bizarre that i doubt it could or would happen anywhere else. If anything, i would expect to see the proliferation of more national movements like, flanders, catalonia, kurdistan, than wanting to join another state.

Are there any other national movements which you have in mind which could be successful in the future, though? 




 Some women *do* give birth after age 40, though. Heck, even my own mom previously did this! 




 That might be due to cis-men's lack of an extra X chromosome and/or due to cis-men's greater level of testosterone in their bodies, though. 




 Because when one commits terrorism, one is not taking anything which belongs to another country for one's own use.

(P.S.: I myself obviously and certainly *don't* support terrorism, including by Iran.) 




 So toofine is being sarcastic? OK, that makes sense. However, it is worth noting that, as far as I know, more men smoke and get heart disease than women do. 




 How exactly do you know that Thailand is better armed than Malaysia, though?

Also, what about, say, China trying to reconquer Mongolia? 




 So are they making Russian food right now? After all, Vladimir Putin appears to be making a lot of effort to portray himself as a boogeyman in Western eyes over the last 1.5 years. 




 No, it isn't. 




 Fat exchanges, anyone? ;) 




 OK; understood. 




 What are you talking about, though? After all, women can certainly smoke and get heart disease, no? 




 Yes, because legalizing gay marriage is certainly going to encourage Australian cattle to have more gay sex and thus to breed less, correct? ;) 




 Understood. Also, out of pure curiosity--what exactly is your penis length when it is flaccid? 




 Funding terrorist groups certainly isn't the same as annexing a part of another country's territory, though. 




 Out of curiosity--if the "Little Ice Age" helped result in a shorter average height for Northern European men, then could this mean that global warming will help result in a taller average height for Northern European men?

Any thoughts on this? 




 That, and maybe poorer nutrition as well. 




 What about the Malay-majority parts of southern Thailand being annexed by Malaysia, though? 




 Agreed; however, for the record, ethnic Persians in Afghanistan are Sunnis, not Shiites. In contrast, ethnic Persians in Iran are overwhelmingly Shiite. 




 There! I fixed it! Is it better now? 




  Maybe, but they already do,

This won't be the case if sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program are lifted, though. 




 Yeah, I guess. English isn't my first language, so yeah. 




  6-7.5" seems about perfect for most girls.

Is that flaccid or erect, though? Serious question, for the record. 




 Yeah, a longer penis can be advantageous for more difficult terrain. ;) 




 10.5''? Is that when his cock is flaccid or when his cock is erect? Serious question, for the record. 




 Well, at least he can try getting a penectomy. ;) 




  and he can't understand why his business never got off the ground

His business might have never got *off* the ground, but at least his penis got *onto* the ground pretty quickly. ;) After all, after a certain amount of penis growth, one's penis *literally* reaches the ground. ;) 




 Porn ads are lies? 




 Completely agreed.

Indeed, I have recently heard a Persian refer to the people in southern Iraq as being just "a bunch of Arabs." Seriously. 




 I wasn't only talking about Russia making such a move, though. After all, other countries can likewise make such a move. 




 Agreed. ;) 




 You appear to have forgotten the fact that a *much* smaller number of women currently die as a result of childbirth than was previously the case (throughout the overwhelming majority of history). 




 End the war on drugs. Period.

Enough said. 




 OK; anything else, though? 




  Iran. Sorry, forgot to put that in there. Iran is a Shiite religion and so is Southern Iraq. I think Arab implies Sunni.

And yet many Arabs themselves would disagree with you that Arab implies Sunni.

 Iran doesn't care about the International community.

It appears to care enough about the international community to engage in serious negotiations with them over its nuclear program.

If it took Southern Iraq it would take control of the Mesopotamian river delta and control the oil flowing out of Iraq.

True; however, Iran would probably have to endure *massive* sanctions as a result of this annexation as well. 




  Well, it's important to remember that Crimea isn't really the first "Crimea".

Actually, it *is* the first "Crimea" in the 21st century.

Russia pulled almost the exact same stunt with Abkhazia and South Ossetia against Georgia,

By "almost," do you mean that Russia wanted to outright annex these two territories and then changed its mind at the last minute?

If so, then I would please like a source for this.

and Transnistria against Moldova.

Russia doesn't even recognize Transnistria's independence, though.

One could also argue that this is similar to what Israel is doing to Palestine.

If one compares it to Israel's 1980 annexation of East Jerusalem, then Yes, certainly. 




 Well, you can't blame me for being lazy. ;) 




 What else would China want other than Taiwan, though? 




 Seriously? 









 Who exactly will annex southern Iraq, though? After all, I don't think that Iran wants to significantly increase the number of Arabs under its rule. Plus, Iran already got in enough trouble with its nuclear program; thus, why exactly should Iran anger the international community even more by annexing southern Iraq? 




 Incestuous marriage and polygamy, of course. ;) 









 LOL cumbox! ;) 




 Uh ... religious Muslim conservatism. :( 




 Fuck Singapore. :( 




 The two atomic bombs weren't enough revenge for us, though. ;) 




 By "future Crimeas," I mean cases where a country sends some of its troops (or some of its "volunteers") to occupy a territory, quickly hold a referendum there, and then annex this territory. In fact, this is what Russia previously did (or appears to have done) in Crimea in early 2014.

Anyway, any thoughts on this? Also, Yes, this is certainly a completely serious question. 




 Much more women also historically died during childbirth; in turn, this also made women's life expectancy lower than it would have otherwise been. 














 *Much* bigger problems, in fact. 




 That Bush Jr. overthrew Saddam Hussein at least in part as a result of daddy issues. 




 You might be able to thank the Second Intifada for that, though. 




 OK; that said, though--wouldn't it have been more productive *not* to make jockstraps assless if they were only meant to be used for this purpose? 




  My apologies. I must have blinked and missed its moment in the sunshine.

Apology accepted. :)

 Sprang from nowhere and practically vanished to the same place, am I right?

Yes, you are correct in regards to this. However, Kadima only appears to have vanished after Mofaz brought Kadima into Netanyahu's coalition in 2012 and then accomplished nothing inside of this coalition. Had Mofaz not done that, then Kadima might still exist today. 




 Kadima was actually the *largest* party in the Knesset back in 2008, though. 




 You're welcome! :) 




 I guess so. ;) 




 Apparently these are the three songs in this video:

Keep Quiet (Original Mix) by Simon Patterson Feat. Lucy Pullin, 1998 (TyDi   Dennis Sheperd Remix) by Binary Finary and Silent Tears (Orjan Nilsen Remix) by Mark Sherry Feat. Sharone. 




 Convince my parents to invest *a lot* of money on various Intrade betting options, such as betting on an Obama victory in 2008. 









 Well, now you know the importance of time. ;)

On a more compassionate note, though, I'm sorry for your loss. :( 




 If a sushi chef is offended by this, then he or she shouldn't probably be making sushi in restaurants for a living in the first place. ;) 









 2 what? 




 Yes, I think so. 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 I don't smoke weed *at all*, though. Seriously. 




 Here you go:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner 









 It's the current mentality of many Israeli *people*, though. 




 For the record, though, I will say this--it appears that Libya was a larger threat to Israel back in 2002-2003 than Iran is today. After all, unlike Iran, Libya actually *did* want to build nuclear weapons in 2002-2003 (and earlier as well). In this regard, I am certainly extremely happy that the U.S. and U.K. got Libya to give up its WMDs and its nuclear weapons program in December 2003. In addition to making Israel more secure, it also allowed NATO to help overthrow Gaddafi eight years later (in 2011) without the fear of WMDs or nuclear weapons being used against NATO member countries. 




 Can't he try having Israel bomb Iran if he really wanted to do this, though? 




 Well, you could have researched it more. ;) 




  You keep harping about Israel being "threatened"

Actually, I am simply saying what the current Israeli mentality in regards to this is. Personally, though, I agree with you that Iranian nukes almost certainly not mean that Israel is going to be nuked.

when in fact it is Israel that is threatening everyone else with their real, actual, existing nukes,

Who exactly is Israel threatening with their nukes, though?

and furthmore the people who are actually being wiped out are the Palestinians, at the hands of the Israels.

I don't think that the Palestinians are being "wiped out," as you claim. However, I myself certainly support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict approximately based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed land swaps. Frankly, it might actually be a good idea for the international community (including the U.S.) to pressure Israel more in regards to this (of course, the Palestinians also have some issues of their own that they will need to deal with before Israeli-Palestinian peace can be made).

The Israeli politicians themselves admitted that the "Iranian threat" is domestically exaggerated for their own purposes.

Yes, and this certainly does not surprise me.

Israel is not the victim.

Agreed, but many Israelis disagree with your view on this. 




 Yes, it did, because it shows that you didn't give enough of a damn to research how exactly her name is spelled. :( 




 Why, though? 




 Actually, the Israel-Lebanon border has been pretty quiet over the last nine years. 




  What a load of crap.

Israel prefers to be safe rather than sorry. I have to admit that it is idiotic for Iran's leadership and/or military to threaten Israel, though. After all, this only feeds the paranoia that many Israelis have in regards to this.

First of all, 40 nations can make nukes quickly right now if they wanted to, so there's nothing special about Iran joining the same club as about 1 out of 4 nations on the planet. http://old.seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002041473_nukes21.html
Unlike them, Iran has repeatedly offered to play additional restrictions on its nuclear program, well in excess of what it legally required of Iran but these offers were ignored by the US. IAEA Director ElBaradei noted this himself:

Yes, you are correct in regards to this. However, Iran's threats to Israel is what Israel makes especially concerned about Iran. After all, Israel appears to be cool with Muslim-majority Pakistan having nuclear weapons due to the fact that Pakistan isn't threatening Israel.

Why? Because the US was always using the "Iranian nuclear threat" as simply a pretext to topple the govt there, just like "WMDs in Iraq" had nothing to do with any actual WMDs. Again, IAEA Director ElBaradei:

Actually, I agree with you that Iran might *not* be interested in building actual nuclear weapons right now. Indeed, if our assumption here is accurate, then it would probably be *counterproductive* for Israel to bomb Iran considering that this might actually make Iran determined to build actual nuclear weapons.

Second, Iran is not out to nuke Israel, never was.

I certainly agree with you in regards to this. After all, the Iranian regime's main priority appears to be its own long-term survival. However, Israel wants to reduce this risk to exactly zero.

That was bullshit cooked up by the Israelis because a potential improvement in US-Iran ties risks leaving them out in the cold, so they've been pushing for YEARS to get the US and Iran into a war, just as they did with Iraq.

Maybe, but the statements of Iranian leaders in regards to this certainly haven't been helpful in reducing Israeli paranoia in regards to this:

https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei#2000

"Iran's stance has always been clear on this ugly phenomenon (Israel). We have repeatedly said that this cancerous tumor of a state should be removed from the region No one will allow a bunch of thugs, lechers and outcasts from London, America and Moscow to rule over the Palestinians."

In fact, Iran accepted over 100,000 casualities from chemical weapons warfare by US-backed Saddam, and refused to reply in kind on moral grounds though it could have done so legally. So when they say they oppose WMDs, they've proven it with blood. http://cns.miis.edu/archive/cns/programs/dc/briefs/030701.htm

Yes, I agree with you that the Iranian regime probably does have some moral aversion to chemical and nuclear weapons for the reason that you pointed out above. However, as far as I know, the Iranian regime *can* be flexible in regards to this; for instance, I think that then-Iranian President Rafsanjani wanted to build chemical weapons in 1989-1990 in the event that a new Iran-Iraq war would have broken out.

Meanwhile, the only country in the Mideast that actually has nukes is Israel,

Correct (if one does not consider Pakistan to be a part of the Middle East, that is)!

and the only country that is known to have tried to sell nukes to others is Israel.

Yes, Israel tried to sell nukes to the racist Apartheid regime in S Africa

Well, Israel certainly appears to have screwed up in that regard. After all, *no* nuclear weapons-state should sell or give its nuclear weapons to other countries (and Yes, this certainly includes Pakistan, especially in the event that Pakistan tries giving or selling actual nuclear weapons to Saudi Arabia).

This was back when Iran was supporting Nelson Mandela, who had been labelled a "terrorist" by the US -- Mandela later came to Iran and personally thanked them for their staunch support, and refused to join Clinton's sanctions against Iran.

First of all, please let me say that I certainly oppose the Apartheid government which existed in South Africa back then and am glad that it was eventually gotten rid of. However, wasn't Nelson Mandela actually involved in terrorism back then? 




 Bonjour to you, my good man! :) 




 He said that their names are Bruce and Kaitlyn [Caitlyn]. 




 Actually, I myself am currently childless and nevertheless still like the Teletubbies. :) 




 Dude ... that's just fucking awful! :( Please--no awful jokes like that. :( 




 Because I wasn't talking about a personality change here; rather, I was only talking about a species change here. 




 Wouldn't this allow Iran to build nuclear weapons very quickly if it decided to do this, though?

After all, I know that countries such as Japan already have a nuclear weapons capability. 




 Maybe ... maybe. 




 So two of the Teletubbies are transgender? 




 Well, Netanyahu also doesn't want a second Holocaust. After all, many Jews were unfortunately previously caught off-guard when they didn't take Adolf Hitler's 1939 prophecy that European Jewry will be annihilated in the event of another World War seriously. :( 




 So two of the Teletubbies got sex changes? 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Aren't Po and Laa-Laa females while Dipsy and Tinky-Winky are males, though? If so, then one male and one female have a "stick" on the top of their heads while one other male and one other female have a hole on the top of their heads. 




 What exactly is that supposed to mean, though? 




 Very true. 




 Something which involves me having a vagina, I suppose.

Since I myself have no intention to get a vagina indefinitely, I will never attempt this in reality indefinitely. 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Oh! OK; understood. 




 If Netanyahu genuinely wants to sabotage this nuclear deal, then he would probably be *much* better off by vehemently arguing in favor of this nuclear deal and frequently saying that this nuclear deal will subdue Iran and put Iran in its place.

If Netanyahu will actually do this, then it might very well make it *much* harder for Iranian "moderates" such as Rouhani and Zarif to get the necessary support for this nuclear deal back home in Iran. 









 Actually, I think that he might ironically be *helping to stabilize* U.S.-Iran relations by making it easier for Iranian "moderates" such as Rouhani and Zarif to "sell" this nuclear deal back home in Iran. After all, they can claim that this nuclear deal is great for Iran due to the fact that Netanyahu (Iran's enemy) strongly opposes it. 




 Redditors can be *extremely* insightful at certain times. This is indeed one of those times. :) 




 On the bright side, though, comments such as these might ironically make it easier for Iranian "moderates" such as Rouhani and Zarif to "sell" this nuclear deal back home in Iran. 




 Well, Yes--Netanyahu is paranoid about Iran. Thus, what exactly would you have expected? 




 Except the hawks, that is. 





























 Yep, and in this regard, legalized gay marriage is technically an expansion of rights for *everyone*.

(P.S.: I myself certainly support legalized gay marriage worldwide.) 




 Grover Cleveland is close behind FDR in regards to his total number of vetoes, though (if one combines Cleveland's first and second non-consecutive terms, that is): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_vetoes 




 Yep. :) 



















 Also, again, *any* risk of an unplanned pregnancy which is unacceptable for at least some pro-choicers in the hypothetical event of an abortion ban (even if one takes rape out of the equation, though for the record, male-bodied people *can* be victims of rape by female-bodied people) likewise isn't good enough for me either. It really is that simple (even if one ignores all of my gender identity issues). Thus, the choice for me is either castration in a safe, medical setting (after some therapy, obviously) or a "back-alley" castration, and I am pretty sure that any decent person would prefer the former over the latter if these were the only two acceptable options for someone (such as for myself).

Also, Yes, I am certainly well-aware of the difference between pregnancy and child support. However, this only strengthens my own point about risk here considering that a low enough risk should make this difference irrelevant; thus, if this difference is relevant, then the risk of an unplanned pregnancy certainly isn't low enough for me to stop worrying about it. 




  I'm not sure, is it rape if two nine year old kids have sex?
 Or what if it's two 13 year olds? Same issue.

I would say Yes to both of these questions. 




 By that rationale, though, would forcing males whose contraception failed to pay child support for 18/21 years (or possibly even longer than that if it's a severely disabled child) be a punishment for these males? 




 You *are* aware that my proposal here is similar to what Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf previously proposed, correct? 




 I think that you made a double-post here. 




 Understood; that said, though, I still felt compelled to ask this question anyway due to the fact that it is something which has strongly interested me ever since late 2008.

Also, would asking about Shimon Peres winning in 1996 be a better question (in your opinion)? 




 He appears to look *a lot* like Mulan in this self-portrait. ;) 




  Mufaz is not Bibi or Peres, so no.

What exactly makes them meaningfully different from Mofaz, though?

 The fact that you are asking there and not in r/technology for example means you think there will be a difference from their point of view.

This doesn't seem like an appropriate question for r/technology, though.

 To the point, Nobody cares about him or remembers who he is.

Maybe; of course, I still find it interesting that Mofaz almost defeated Livni for the leadership of Kadima back in 2008. 




  My life in Israel TM

OK. ;)

 Mufaz had no supporters outside some Kadima members he brought into the party.

Well, he must have brought a lot of supporters into the party considering that he almost won the 2008 Kadima leadership election.

Under his leadership in 2013 Kadima barely entered the Keneset when before it was the ruling party. That's what happens when the public votes, not just your buddies.

I think that this occurred due to the fact that Mofaz had Kadima enter Netanyahu's coalition in 2012 and then failed to accomplish anything when Kadima was in this coalition, though. If not for that mistake, then Kadima might have done *much* better in the 2013 Knesset elections. 




 I've got a question, though--would it really be in the interest of the Kashmiri Muslims to have Kashmir become a Hindu-majority, non-autonomous part of India rather than to have Kashmir remain a Muslim-majority, autonomous part of India? After all, these would probably be the only two options which I would accept if I myself was an Indian. 




 What exactly are the source and basis for your assertion here, though? 




 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaul_Mofaz 




  I don't, it's just not important.

Are you sure about that, though? Also, by that logic, would Netanyahu's victory over Peres in 1996 likewise be unimportant?

and why are you asking the same question at r/"Palestine" (and everywhere actually)?

Because I want as many people as possible to answer this question.

what is the answer you're looking for?

I am not looking for any specific answer. Rather, I simply want to hear people's thoughts on and responses to this question, whatever these thoughts and responses might be. 




 You forgot about Israel, though. 




  Are those all equally comparable?

Yes, I would think so.

If Palestinians are more easily identifiable and able to return, but poles aren't, does that mean the Palestinians also shouldn't be?

Yes, it does, at least for the time being.

 As well, since you've essentially said it's impossible to do and not going to happen, and therefore shouldn't happen in Palestine, do you then still oppose a referendum in Kashmir? Seeing as the refugees aren't going to return, why shouldn't they just have a referendum with people who are there?

Ah ... I see where exactly you are going with this. Anyway, I will say this--your position on this is certainly not an invalid one. In fact, I am no longer going to outright argue against it. However, if I was an Indian, then I would refuse to agree to a referendum in Kashmir until all of the areas in Kashmir will become Hindu-majority (this might be accomplished by allowing Hindus from other parts of India to buy land in Kashmir, et cetera). However, in such a case, the outcome of this referendum will probably simply be a reconfirmation of the Line of Control as the border between India and Pakistan. 




  Pakistan fought 3 wars with India before they hooked onto the Kashmir issue around 1990.

Weren't two of those three wars about Kashmir, though?

So Kashmir is not the real issue but a symptom of a violent Islamic expansionism that has been going on for more than a millennium.

Actually, I think that it is a bit of both. Both the 1947 Partition itself and the forced migration which resulted from it probably strained Indo-Pakistani relations, as did India's military intervention to ensure Bangladesh's secession from Pakistan in 1971 after Pakistan committed genocide there. However, I *do* think that the Kashmir dispute is a part of the reason for India's and Pakistan's hatred of each other.

 Legally speaking, the entire Kashmir state belongs to India and if that legality is called into question then the existence of Pakistan can also be questioned since both have come into existence from the same Instrument of Accession, which is why Pakistan occupied Kashmir is not included in Pakistan's Constitution and people living in those territories are not Pakistani citizens.

Yes, this appears to be accurate. However, from that perspective, why exactly did India take the Kashmir issue to the United Nations in the first place instead of simply finishing the job militarily in 1949 and kicking Pakistan out of all of Kashmir? (Heck, I think that India even agreed to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir in the late 1940s before changing its mind on this later on).

 The only excuse that Pakistan   other Muslim countries have for Kashmir and Israel is of human rights, democracy   plebiscite etc. but then that can be easily busted by the fact that there is hardly any human rights   democracy in most Muslim majority countries.

Agreed; also, if Pakistan wanted a plebiscite in Kashmir, then it could have already held such a plebiscite on the parts of Kashmir which it already currently controls.

 Plebiscite cannot be conducted in Kashmir because Pakistan has not only changed the original demography of Pak occupied Kashmir but they have also driven out 500,000 Hindus from India's side of Kashmir using state sponsored terrorists.

Agreed.

 Which is why in November 2010, United Nations has excluded Jammu and Kashmir from its annual list of unresolved international disputes under the observation of the United Nations Security Council.

Yes, I think that I have previously heard about that. However, Kashmir is still currently de facto disputed between India and Pakistan.

 So the matter ends there as of now, with the Line of Control being the temporary solution.

Yes; also, though, it is worth noting that my own solution to the Kashmir dispute advocates eventually converting the Line of Control into the permanent international border between India and Pakistan. 




 Yes, I would ideally support a Palestinian right of return along with things such as the right of ethnic Germans and their descendants to return to areas such as Kaliningrad Oblast and the right of ethnic Poles and their descendants to return to the parts of the former Soviet Union from where they or their ancestors were previously expelled. 




  Do you recognize Palestine?

Do I think that there should be an independent Palestinian state approximately based on the 1967 lines? Yes, I do (but with some mutually agreed land swaps).

Just curious.

OK.

And the Palestinian right of return?

As of right now, No, considering that the application of this principle isn't universal. For instance, Russia certainly won't allow the ethnic Germans who were expelled from Kaliningrad or their descendants to move back to Kaliningrad right now.

However, Yes, I do *ideally* support the right of return both in Israel and everywhere else.

Hoping for some consistency.

OK.
 




 Actually, you appear to be forgetting the fact that Mofaz came within several hundred votes of defeating Livni in that 2008 election:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadima_leadership_election,_2008

 




 What exactly would have happened afterwards? How exactly would the history of Israel over the last seven years have been different?

Any thoughts on this?

 This might have been the case up to 2010, but no longer appears to be the case.

Also, it is worth noting that Japan's government always keeps track of their oldest man and woman just to make sure that they are still alive. 




  I mean I was 3 at the time

Well, I myself was 6/7 back in 1999. :)

but honestly time seems to be flying faster than it ever did when I was younger.

Agreed.

Eh, I guess that's getting old.

Agreed. :( 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 History, especially post-1815 Western history. :) After all, the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath really did make history more interesting, in my honest opinion. :) 




 None, because I intend to get cryogenically preserved and the hopefully successfully revived after I will die. ;) 









 I am still waiting for a response to this question--did this man take hormone replacement therapy after his orchiectomy, though? 









 How exactly are you defining middle-aged here, though? After all, being 42 years old wouldn't exactly be middle-aged for a man who lived to age 112. 









 Did the Communists ever actually have a realistic chance of coming to power in Iran, though? 




 There--fixed ... just for you. :)

 I'm sorry ... what? 




 Only if he is in Heaven right now. 




 If so, then why exactly didn't someone save him? 




 Yep--the last two appear to have send him straight to the afterlife. :( 




 Um ... why not? 




 Yes--Kathleen Snavely; she was Irish-born but died in the U.S.A. 




 Yes, I guess so. 




 Actually, two currently living *women* are still from the 1800s. :) 




 Actually, he was Japanese. 




 If so, then this might have been the best way *ever* for someone to commit suicide. Seriously. 




 That, or maybe his stomach and thus his body couldn't take in that much food at once. 




 To eat all of that? 




 Indeed, he is remembered by Swedish schoolchildren as "the king who ate himself to death":

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_deaths#18th_century 









 I apologize if this question was already asked before (including by me), but out of curiosity--exactly which additional countries (as in, countries other than the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia), if any, do you think would have been likely to have gotten federalized based on ethnic lines if Communists would have come to power in these countries?

For the record, these countries need to be countries where Communists actually had a good chance of coming to power (especially, but not only, during and/or after World War II).

 Most of the people of Belarus, Crimea, and parts of Eastern Ukraine might be okay with this. However, Yes, there will probably be large-scale protests and riots in western Ukraine and perhaps in central Ukraine as well. Indeed, I wouldn't be surprised if these large-scale protests and riots will eventually cause the Russian government to allow most of Ukraine to secede from Russia.

 Does Adolf Hitler rabid anti-Semitism and the policies that this caused him to implement count for this? After all, I can't imagine that events such as Kristallnacht were viewed very favorably in the West. 









 I am! :) 




 Actually, this would be a case where I would encourage transgender individuals to defy the chromosome labels on these bathrooms. :) Civil disobedience at its finest! :) 




 So, in other words, ISIS = evil whereas SISI = good, correct? 




 So you're saying that Captain Moses (a.k.a. Captain Mosey) did not get the Ten Commandments (well, later the Eight Commandments) from God at Mount Salsa? ;) If so, then shame on you for challenging my Pastafarian faith! ;) You, sir, are going to spend Eternity in Super-Mega Hell unless you repent for your sinfulness! ;) 




  Sisi is right in saying that a lasting agreement would make things better.

It will make things for Israel and Palestine. For the record countries in the region, though, not so much. After all, the Syrian Civil War has literally nothing to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

You are also correct in your belief that the P.A. would not honour an agreement.

Actually, I think that Fatah *will* honor such an agreement. However, terrorist groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad are going to need to be fully and veritably disarmed in such a peace treaty. If Fatah cannot accomplish this task itself, then it might be up to Israel to do this, and unfortunately doing this can be extremely bloody for anyone who tries to do this. :( 




 Actually, as far as I know, Mahmoud Abbas *did* previously present his own peace proposal while Netanyahu did not. If Netanyahu is unwilling to present a peace proposal of his own, then how exactly can peace talks meaningfully advance? 




 This would be a final peace treaty, though, rather than a temporary one. Thus, any violations of this peace treaty will probably be treated very severely. 




 Yes, they certainly should. Of course, Netanyahu likewise needs to want to make peace with the Palestinians as well. 




 Agreed. Solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be great for the Israelis and for the Palestinians, but not so much for the neighboring countries in the Middle East. After all, things such as the Sunni-Shiite conflict have literally *nothing* to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 




 Yes, Israeli-Palestinian peace will make the Middle East somewhat safer. However, one should also be aware that a lot of what is currently occurring in the Greater Middle East does *not* have much, if anything, to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Thus, the mentality that Israeli-Palestinian peace will result in everyone in the Greater Middle East shaking hands and singing "Kumbaya" is extremely delusional and idiotic! 




 A *woman* recruiting *girls* for Islamic State; shit--doesn't she realize that Islamic State is *extremely* misogynistic? :( 









 I strongly hope that you are correct in regards to this. 




 Understood; did you like the Norwegian and Russian foods which you ate there, though? Also, can you please elaborate on exactly what kind of foods it was (as in, the names of these foods)? 




 Yeah, basically, I think that Kagame needs to make a distinction between hate speech (which I have no problem banning in Rwanda for the time being, though ideally I would oppose banning it anywhere) and legitimate criticism of him. After all, advocating another genocide in Rwanda certainly isn't the same thing as criticizing Kagame for his authoritarianism. Based on what I have read, Kagame makes no distinction between his critics (and in, he doesn't care whether or not they are hate-mongers); however, this certainly doesn't surprise me considering that it is in a dictator's interest to suppress any dissent and opposition.

That said, though, in spite of all of Kagame's flaws, I certainly prefer him over what happened in Rwanda in 1994. After all, please correct me, but the impression that I am getting is that if one shuts up and doesn't criticize Kagame, then the Rwandan government will treat this individual well and help improve his or her life over time. If so, then Rwanda appears to be *much* better than some other dictatorships right now. :) 




 Congratulations to your dad! :) * Hugs * :) 




 Did you like the food there as well? 




  Saudi Arabia. Arabs are by far the most warm-hearted and friendly people I've ever met.

Would this still be true if they interacted with an Israeli-American Jew such as myself, though? 




 Very interesting! :)

Also, out of curiosity, isn't Paul Kagame and his leadership of Rwanda been responsible for a lot, if not most, of the progress that Rwanda has made over the last 20 years? 




 Very interesting. :) Was your trip extremely expensive, though? 




 Where exactly within South Korea did you visit, though? 




 Yes, please. :) 




 It appears that these bathrooms are transphobic. :( What a shame! :( 









 As for me, my great-uncle, who was born on June 20, 1906 and died on January 25, 2002 at the age of 95 (for the record, I myself was born in 1992).

 Nothing, since I *don't want* to have balls! :( Seriously. 














 So do I! ;) 









 RAmen, brother! ;) 




  Well, from my limited understanding of France in this time period; no.
 Perhaps you can make some stretch that the relative disunity of France in the Hundred Year's War (HYW) is comparable to the initial confusion and disorder present in the RKKA, but I'd say its too much of a stretch. The disorder in the RKKA in 1941 is as much a result of purges and confusion as it is because of legitimate losses; the savagery and speed of the initial attack is as much to blame for the RKKA's condition in the first month of conflict as any pre-existing conditions.

OK.

 Comparatively, France's disunity has far more to do with the fact that well....'nations' as we understand them simply didn't exist at this time. In terms of unity of command and concentration of forces, England's far greater unity gave it a de facto local superiority or at the very least parity in numbers.

I've got a question, though--didn't the French King already have the authority to raise troops from areas which were under this control and/or under the control of his vassals back then?

 In short, the political and other pre-existing conditions are in no way similar and its a gross misunderstanding of the politics of France in this time period to simply look at size and population and go 'France's military potential was infinitely greater than England's.'

Please pardon my ignorance in regards to this, but did vassals of the French King actually have the authority to disobey him during this time? As in, if the French King would have demanded some troops from them, would they have been able to refuse this demand of his without any negative repercussions for themselves?

 Finally, the HYW in reality is a series of separate wars, and must be imagined in such a light. Several of these series of wars ended with treaties highly favorable to the English, and one can indeed safely conclude that the English Kings related to those treaties did accomplish many of their political goals.

It is worth noting, though, that Nazi Germany might have likewise been able to get a favorable treaty from the Soviet Union in, say, October 1941. However, Hitler appears to have been too greedy and wanted more and thus ended up losing everything in the end. 




 Fuck yeah! 









 OK--I apologize if this sounds far-fetched, but I was thinking if there is actually a very good analogy between the Hundred Years' War and the Eastern Front of World War II.

To elaborate on this, in both the Hundred Years' War (which, as far as I know, was actually a series of wars) and in the Eastern Front of World War II, a less populous country (England and Nazi Germany, respectively) was able to initially make very large territorial conquests in a much larger country (France and Russia, respectively). However, in spite of their very large territorial conquests, neither England nor Nazi Germany succeeded in achieving their ultimate war aims (conquering all of France and conquering the Soviet Union up to the Urals, respectively). Likewise, both France and the Soviet Union were eventually able to "regain their footing" and to use their numerical superiority (and presumably resource and logistical superiority as well) to push back against the English and Nazi German invaders and to eventually kick both of these invaders out of France and Russia, respectively. To my knowledge, after the English were kicked out of France and the Germans were kicked out of Russia, neither England nor Germany was ever able to pose a serious land-based threat to France and Russia, respectively.

Any thoughts on this analogy of mine?

 What exactly does BFE mean, though? Also, exactly which Russian foods did you eat?

As for me, I ate various Russian foods which my parents made, including borscht, shchi, Olivier salad, pelmeni, plov, et cetera. These Russian foods really were quite delicious! :)

 Well, maybe Russia can look at Israel to see what exactly Israel is doing right in regards to this. After all, the current fertility rate among Israeli *Jews* is currently 30.1 or 3.1 children per woman. :) 




 Actually, Russia is my daddy. ;) 




 Fuck yeah, she is! :) 




 So basically, Russia wants Kinder fur Der Reich, correct? ;) 




 You're straight? Are you sure about that? ;) 




 That joke is fucking awful! 














 What if you were born intersex, though? 




 Agreed. 









 There is none; I am just saying that some clothes, such as some panties, are especially made for certain people; else, they wouldn't literally be uncomfortable to wear for (many) men with penises. 









 Actually, I was talking about it in a literal sense--these panties might literally not have enough room for penises. Seriously. 




 Actually, he might be happy now that he realizes that he might get his 72 virgins earlier than he previously expected. ;) 




 Great! :) Now, hopefully they will enjoy their 72 male nerd virgins ;) :

 Female panties (often) aren't mean to be worn by males with penises, though. ;) 




 http://omniatlas.com/

A great atlas for post-1818 maps. :) 




 Yep, though I think that having Colorado do this was legal. After all, don't the states themselves determine how to pick electors? 




  I'm not so sure... I guess "Was the Redemption inevitable" is one of those unknowable questions of history.

Do you honestly think that the North would have had the will to keep large numbers of U.S. troops in the South for decades, though?

 Either way, "You'll let us terrorize, disenfranchise and persecute black citizens, and we'll make your guy president" is pretty awful.

That already began to occur before the 1876 election, though. In fact, I think that there were only 3 Southern states where federal U.S. troops were still stationed in 1876. 




 Why not cross-dressers, though? 




  Maybe, but then the south wouldn't have been left to the redeemers.

Actually, I don't think that the North would have been willing to keep large amounts of federal troops stationed in the Southern U.S. eventually.

This election was so crooked it fucked up free elections for nearly 100 years.

Frankly, I am extremely skeptical of this due to the fact that I think that Redeemer rule in the South would have eventually been inevitable either way for the reason which I stated above. 




 Ah, Yes, Kazakhstan, Home of Borat! ;) 




 "No, No, No--what exactly is that American flag bikini doing here?" ;) 




 Wow! I can't believe that it took them this long to do this! ;) 




 Actually, Hayes might have won if this election would have been completely free and fair due to the fact that Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina all had a Black-majority population back then. 




 Understood. 




 Wow! He sounds a lot like myself in many respects. :) Seriously. 









 Out of curiosity, though--what exactly was your ex-husband's sexuality? 




 Sure, she's discussing her own lived experiences. However, I stand by my statement that she is hastily generalizing by assuming that *all* cross-dressers only do it for sexual reasons. 




 Thank you. :) For the record, though, unlike you, I was born with a male body, so yeah. 




 So jock-straps and the like? 




  Late 20s.

Understood.

 Have you seen a gender therapist?

No, not yet. However, I certainly intend to do this eventually. :) 




 One can argue that cross-dressers *are* making a type of temporary transition, though. 




 Yes, I get all of that, but I am unsure that this makes these terms themselves less valid when it comes to cross-dressers.

Also, please let me think about how I best want to express my own thoughts on regards to this. :) 




  Yeah I basically consider myself "some kind of genderqueer" in my head.

OK.

I've thought about a gender therapist but it's not really a priority right now :)

Well, if you will have the money for it, then at least seriously consider doing this eventually. After all, it might end up helping you out. :)

I am going to be starting a new job later this year though, and definitely want to come up with a more neutral sounding nickname to introduce myself by at the office.

Good luck with this, then! :)

Also, though, out of curiosity--exactly how old are you right now? 




 So a genderqueer appearance wouldn't be sexually attractive for you? 




 I certainly understand where exactly you are coming from in regards to this. However, I think that you are hastily generalizing about cross-dressers' motives; after all, I myself would enjoy cross-dressing if I had a nicer and much less hairy body, but my own interest in cross-dressing is primarily non-sexual. 




 I'm actually very aware of this, but thank you anyway. :) 




 Insulting in what sense, exactly? 




 Thanks for sharing this info. :) Also, maybe you are genderqueer. :)

In addition, out of curiosity, did you talk to a gender therapist about this yet? After all, a gender therapist might be able to help you out in regards to this. :) 




 No, I'm just lazy. ;) 




 Yeah, I will make sure to ask this question there. :)

However, if I am right in regards to this, then would you be okay with giving me an apology for this? 




 Frankly, I really should ask transgender people about their views in regards to this. 




 What you are telling me is actually news to me. Seriously. Thus, here's what I am going to do--I am going to ask transgender people on Reddit and elsewhere their thoughts about using such terms to describe non-transgender cross-dressers. After all, I might as well educate myself on this, no? 




 Understood. 




 OK. 




 Why, though? 




 What exactly do you mean by "basically"? I'm just curious. 




 Understood. 




 What if he wants to be a civil rights activist and to stay where you two currently are and to personally fight this bigotry, though? 




 Actually, in such a case, you would be an FtM cross-dresser, but not an FtM transgender person. 




 Great to hear! :) 




 So you're a lesbian? 




 So what exactly would they need to do in order to look attractive to you? 




 What if everything that he is going to ask you to do is to go to public events with him while he is dressed as a woman so that the two of you will look like a lesbian couple? Serious question, for the record. 




 But what if she wants to present as a male while she is cross-dressing? 




  I don't see any problem with the way you designated your opposite-sex cross dressers. I can sorta see why other people might not be pleased with it but alas.

Well, Yeah--it's just much more convenient to use short abbreviations for this. :)

And my answer is shit yes I would. I would have a killer time participating, too.

Would you enjoy going with him to public events looking like a lesbian couple, though? 




  FtM and MtF are terms for binary trans people, not for people who cross dress.

Source, please?

I'd date a woman who cross dressed. Would be awful hypocritical of me not to.

I wouldn't date a woman who cross-dressed and used the term FtM to describe herself or her fashion choices.

Out of curiosity, though--what exactly is your sexuality? 




 Understood. 




 Understood. 




 Understood. 




 What if it was important that you were involved, though? 




 Good to hear! :) 




 Well, there are a few men who are that short.

Also, though, they can buy their own female clothes. :) 




 Is this invalid terminology for cross-dressers, though? After all, it's much more convenient than writing this out. 




 Also, it would certainly be nice if one avoids making hasty generalizations, including in regards to my question here. 




 Out of curiosity--are you very short? 




 I didn't ask about trans people here, though.

After all, not all cross-dressers are transgender. 




 Any thoughts on this? 














 Thanks for clarifying this part.

Also, I am certainly glad that I could be of help to you! :) 




 Also, no offense, but a Google search might have avoided years of agony for you. Just saying. ;) 




 No problem! :) 




 But then the act itself still won't be illegal; rather, simply talking about it might be illegal. 




 Yes, it is. Also, that book's name might be The Kingdom of Matthias. :) 




 Yes, it certainly is an attack on free speech; however, it still doesn't make gay sex itself illegal. 




 That doesn't make homosexuality itself illegal, though. 




 Putin the Ass:

http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/putin.png

 




 Gay sex *isn't* illegal in Russia, though. 




 Great news! :) After all, the War on Drugs is obviously a failure and should thus be ended. 




 Unlike Socrates and Jesus, though, Abraham didn't die for his beliefs--did he? 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Eh ... frankly, I myself like Stewie both ways. :) 




 OK, cowboy (or cowgirl). ;) 




 Robots, of course. ;) 




 If *he* will win the Latino vote, then the KKK will win the Black vote. ;) 




 So you're a time traveler, eh? ;) 




 After all, Jesus's and Socrates's life stories have notable similarities. 




  I don't remember him running around naked in the streets.

Were you actually there, though? ;) 




 Frankly, this reminds me of Josef Mengele (sp?) giving candy to Jewish children before he conducted *extremely* brutal experiments on them. :( 




 Actually, we exist because the Flying Spaghetti Monster (a.k.a. His Almighty Noodliness) willed it. ;) 




 Apparently that part of this article got stuck in his ass; that's right--his ass can tear apart online articles--that's how powerful it is! ;) 




 "Oh, what a cute little puppy! In fact, it's cute enough for punch!" *Punch!* ;) 




 Yep! :) 









 It is worth noting that the U.S. conducted nationwide censuses from 1790, though; in contrast, the first nationwide railroad in the U.S. was only completed in 1869, 79 years later! 




 Intellectually honest and decent people would nevertheless oppose this, though. 




 You might very well be correct in regards to this. :( 




 Do you mean people with the last name Taft? 




 Then Third Wave Feminists can either get some sense or go to Hell. 




 Did you see any images of President Taft there, though? ;) 




 No--rather, like my and my parents' trip to Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands that year. :) 




 For the record, here is a book about this man: http://www.amazon.com/The-Kingdom-Matthias-Salvation-19th-Century/dp/0199892490 









 Any thoughts on this? 









 Because seven eight [ate] nine. ;) 




 Also, unless men's and women's bodies react to alcohol differently (do they?), I think that if one argues that women with a certain alcohol level in their bodies are too drunk to consent to sex, then men with the same alcohol level in their bodies should likewise be considered to be drunk to consent to sex. After all, it would be fair that way. 




  What I'm saying is, when rape claims come up, it's less about the chick proving it than it is about the guy proving it didn't happen, he's generally assumed to be guilty even though the IUPG statement is thrown around.

OK, but *why* exactly is this the case? After all, while I didn't pay much attention to this, didn't the Duke Lacrosse team case bring false rape accusations to the attention of the American public?

A chick can claim rape/sex assault and Kickback while the guy's life unravels and unless he miraculously finds a way to prove his innocence, at best he'll be seen as a sketchball for the rest of his life, at worst he'll be locked up and put on a list.

Why the fuck is this the reality, though? After all, if what you are telling is the truth, then this is a *very* dangerous situation!

Someone sincerely for gender equality totally should be against this but since many feminists are really "anti-men" and don't want actual gender equality, theyre not gonna complain.

Unfortunately, you might very well be correct in regards to this. :(

While I support a lot, if not most, of what feminists advocate, I absolutely loathe it when feminists seek revenge for centuries and millenniums of men discriminating against women. Yes, that was certainly a tragedy and it shouldn't have occurred, but we can't wave a magic and and undo the past. Frankly, if I myself had such a revenge-filled mentality, then I would support throwing a whole bunch of nuclear weapons on Germany in revenge for the Nazis previously killing many of my Jewish ancestors and relatives. However, this would obviously be utter madness, which in turn further demonstrates the utter and absolute futility of having a revenge-filled mentality. After all, I think that David Xanatos in Gargoyles said that "revenge is a sucker's game." 




 Please forgive me if I am missing something, but it seems like for rape, as for all crimes, the burden of proof should be on the *accuser* regardless of his or her gender. After all, it's "innocent until proven guilty," no? 




 Why the heck is the burden of proof on the male, though? After all, if one is against sexism and in favor of gender equality, then shouldn't one oppose this? 




 As far as I know, Russia held its first comprehensive/full (meaning that everyone in Russia was enumerated) census in 1897, whereas many other European countries (Britain, France, et cetera) held their first comprehensive/full census several decades, if not more, earlier than this. My question here is this: why exactly did Russia hold its first comprehensive/full census so late in comparison to other European countries? Was it due to the much greater logistical difficulties involved (of course, this didn't stop the U.S. from conducting such censuses decades earlier than Russia), or was there another reason for this?

Thoughts on this? 




 If this type of policy was implemented everywhere in real life, then there would be *a lot* more rapes going on to the point of undermining and diminishing the importance of *actual* rapes. 




 Frankly, if a woman tries pulling such shit on a man, then this man should file an accusation and say that this woman is the one who *raped him*.

 









 Yes, it probably did. Basically, if Hamas doesn't fvck with Israel, then Israel isn't going to fvck with Hamas. 














 Money speaks louder than facts. :( Unsurprising, but certainly shameful. :( 









 Agreed. Frankly, I despise equating all Muslims with terrorists just as much as I despise equating all Jews with Communists (which is what the Nazis previously did, with extremely tragic consequences afterwards). 




 RAmen, brother! :) 




 RAmen, brother! :) 




 Good! :) Kindness such as this really should be reported about more often! :) 




 OK--here is my question:

Do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a "back-alley")?

This question is not an abstract one; rather, this question is a very real and relevant question for me personally considering that I myself want to become a eunuch in large part for sterilization reasons but also, if possible (after all, I still want to get erections using my penis) for feminization purposes and to reduce my sex drive.

Now--why exactly am I asking this? Well, many pro-choicers, both on Reddit and elsewhere, have told me that they are unwilling to deal with *any* risk of an unwanted offspring being born. Thus, I see absolutely *no* reason for me to be okay with *any* risk of this occurring. However, since I myself obviously don't have the option of abortion (and would *never* rely on *any* woman's word that she will get an abortion *regardless* of whatever promises she made to me beforehand) and consider the idea of abstaining from penis-in-vagina sex with *all* fertile and potentially fertile women to be both utterly unrealistic and utterly unacceptable, there is no other acceptable choice for me in regards to achieving this goal other than castration due to the fact that *all* non-drastic contraceptives and sterilizations have a failure rate.

Also, before someone brings up the "Do no harm" principle, I would like to point out that:

1. This principle was already thrown out of the window when doctors performed many/most medically unnecessary elective surgeries.

2. Self-castration attempts and "back-alley" castration attempts are *much* more dangerous than getting castrated (as in, getting an orchiectomy) in a safe, medical setting.

3. There is *no* other way for a man to get himself sterilized in a way which *cannot ever* fail.

4. The worst effects of castration can be mitigated/dealt with the help of hormone replacement therapy.

Also, in regards to lawsuits, let me say this--first of all, as far as I know, there are waivers for doctors to significantly reduce or eliminate this risk. However, even if one ignores that, it is worth noting that, short of a massive botching of my (planned) castration (orchiectomy), I myself would consider it to be extremely immoral to sue a doctor for performing a castration (orchiectomy) on me. After all, if I will even try suing such a compassionate and caring doctor for doing this, then this doctor might become more hesitant to perform elective castrations in the future, which in turn could very well result in more self-castration attempts and in more back-alley castration attempts (both of which are (much) more dangerous) afterwards. Thus, for me, suing such a doctor for doing this is absolutely intolerable!

In addition to this, please don't lecture me about biological differences! After all, I myself have absolutely *no* intention of being a slave to biology! After all, just because biology is unequal and unfair certainly does *not* mean that we cannot and should not make it more equal and fairer.

Thus, again, my question here is this--do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a "back-alley")?

Any thoughts on this? 
























 OK; good. 




  Well in my opinion if Olmert had been PM for 1 more year we would have definitely had a peace deal.

Agreed.

If Peres had been president instead of netanyahu in 1996 or in 2009 we would have had a peace deal.

Agreed about 2009, but I'm still not sure about 2006.

If Israeli public opinion swings to the left again then the likelihood will go up, but I don't know when that would happen.

Perhaps sometime in the 2020s?

 Ideally the two sides could come to some arrangement where if the settlers cannot be removed, then at least the borders are not very strict, where Jews and Palestinians can use the same roads and live near the same areas in a middle strip of territory between Israel proper and Palestine proper. Jerusalem may also need to be shared somehow, because there are simply too many settlers in East Jerusalem. Its a shitty situation, but if both sides actually wanted to make peace then it could definitely happen.

Yes, I agree with this. Of course, I honestly wonder if the Arabs in East Jerusalem prefer Israeli rule or Palestinian rule. Any thoughts on this?

Hopefully Netanyahu will be replaced in the next 5 years by a genuine two state solution supporter,

Agreed.

and if Abbas dies he will be replaced by someone like Barghouti or Fayyad who would be as willing or more willing to make a deal with Israel.

I don't think that Barghouti will replace Abbas after Abbas dies or retires due to the fact that I don't think that Israel will release Barghouti, at least not anytime soon. Fayyad might be a possible Palestinian Presidential candidate, though, as might someone such as Jibril Rajoub (sp?).

Also, out of curiosity, do you think that we would have already had a final Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty if Shaul Mofaz would have won the 2008 Kadima leadership election? Serious question, for the record.

Also, three additional questions:

1. What exactly do you think the future of the Golan Heights will be?

2. What exactly do you think that Hillary Clinton's policy towards Israel will be if she will win the U.S. Presidency in 2016?

3. Out of pure curiosity, exactly which party did you vote for in the 2015 Israeli Knesset elections? 




 Done. :) 




 OK, but could I just call him from a therapist's office if necessary? 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 What exactly are your thoughts on Ellen Pao? 




 Thank you very much for this info. :)

Also, calcium chloride is table salt, correct? 




 Tom Monaghan is such a lucky bastard! ;) 




 Maybe, or maybe it would have been even more successful. 




 Yep. :) 




 Martians are aliens, though. 




 It is. 




 Nostradamus = The Great Illusionist. ;) 




  True, but I still think that a deal could have been made. Arafat despite his many faults in my opinion did ultimately want to make a deal. I think that if the deal that Peres agreed to in 2011 was offered to Arafat in the late 90's then we would have had a peace deal.

OK; fair enough, I suppose.

The president has no actual political power, which is why we don't have peace with the PA right now, but my understanding is that Netanyahu let Peres negotiate with Abbas in secret talks to see if a deal could be reached. Peres came to an understanding with Abbas on a fairly comprehensive deal, but Netanyahu was not satisfied with the details and then unilaterally ended the talks, as he has the power to do since he is the PM, not Peres.

OK; this appears to make sense.

Also, out of curiosity, when exactly do you think that we will have a final Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty (as in, in real life)? 




 Couldn't Clinton feel free to negotiate starting from 1997, though? After all, he wouldn't have had much to worry about politically after getting re-elected in 1996. 




 OK; for the record, you might very well be correct in regards to this.

Also, though, I wonder if having Peres win in 1996 could have caused the Second Intifada to break out earlier in the event that Israeli-Palestinian peace talks would have failed. Any thoughts on this? 




 Two things:

1. Abbas isn't Arafat.

2. Did Peres even have the authority to negotiate a deal with Abbas? After all, isn't the Israeli Presidency supposed to be a purely ceremonial position? 




 That would be rather risky to do from my house since I don't want my parents to know about this, though. While I told my parents that I want to be a eunuch and to feminize my face and body (and was crystal-clear so that they will know that I am not joking), I don't want them to know the extent of the preparations that I am making for this yet.

 









 So you think that Peres would have actually succeeded in creating a mutually agreeable peace treaty between him and Arafat? 




  Just tell your doctor about this. Tell him that by preventing you from getting one, he is directly responsible for endangering your life. I don't think he will be willing to do that anymore if you present the case this way. But I might be wrong. Any doctors can give some advice on this?

Believe me--I will make sure to tell this to all of my therapists and doctors. 




 Believe me--I strongly do not want to do this and thus would strongly prefer not to do this. 




 Believe me--I strongly do not want to do this and thus would strongly prefer not to do this. 




 That's too far away, though. 




 Believe me--I strongly do not want to do this and thus would strongly prefer not to do this. 




 I previously tried contacting Dr. Arknoff using his website and put in my e-mail. I don't think that I ever got any response from his office. Thus, should I try to do this again? 




 Care to please elaborate on this? 




 What do you mean by "No," though? 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Any thoughts on this? 














 Their last common ancestor in the male line was French King Louis IX, who died in 1270, 319 years earlier! 









  You only have one chance at this, and there is too much that can go wrong. I obviously get dysphoria and gate-keeping, but one can navigate the medical system.

Not all aspiring eunuchs succeed in doing this, though. Else, self-castration attempts and "back-alley" castration attempts would never occur.

It's great that you're really trying hard to go with the safe route, but please don't let potential failure of that to drive you to do something possibly harmful to yourself.

Understood; I just really hope that at least one doctor in the U.S. is going to be willing to perform this procedure on me.

Basically, I have three goals with an orchiectomy:

1. To achieve "bullet-proof" sterilization. Since all non-drastic methods of contraception and sterilization (including vasectomies) can and sometimes do fail, they are just not good enough for me.

2. If my expectations in regards to female hormones will turn out to be accurate, then I would want to use female hormones on a regular or at least on a semi-regular basis. After all, I have heard good things about female hormones from both trans-women and trans-men. However, I must find some way to still be able to get erections using my penis, as well as to still be able to have penis-in-vagina sex, while I am taking female hormones, since otherwise female hormones might not work for me.

3. To better regulate my sex drive and to give my ejaculations and sexual arousal more meaning.

Also, though, independently of that, I also want to permanently get rid of as much of my body hair and facial hair as possible due to the fact that this hair makes me dysphoric (and I unfortunately have a lot of it, so yeah). Likewise, I want to feminize my face to some extent as well, though I still want to live as a man (albeit as a very feminine eunuch) most (but not all) of the time after I will get all of this done. 




 Who exactly told you that, though?

Also, for the record, I myself have also previously heard something like that. 




 Again--I'm not worried about money; rather, I'm worried about excessive gate-keeping. 




  My mother used to use fire to sterilize needles when we had splinters and this method of sterilization is also used in labs. So I would suggest dipping it in rubbing alcohol (make sure it's not soaked so let it drip until it stops dripping) and then put it in the fire for about 5 seconds (really until the rubbing alcohol is burned off). And this tool should be metal.

I don't have any fire at my house, though.

If you can do that even better, they could help you faster I would think.

OK; good.

I suggest learning how stitch pieces of fabric and learning the stitch used to close skin. Also for the stitches if you can somehow use the ones surgeons use.

OK, I suppose.

What would you use these to do?

Rubber bands: Put them around my testicles, thus cutting off blood flow to my testicles. After a certain amount of time, my testicles will die due to the lack of blood flow. Afterwards, with the rubber bands still attached to my dead testicles, go to the emergency room and have my dead testicles get removed.

A burdizzo: Cut the spermatic cord and thus kill the testicles, no? Also, afterwards, go to the emergency room and get my dead testicles removed.

Alcohol injections: Use them to kill my testicles and then go to the emergency room afterwards in order to get my testicles removed. 




  Honestly, in a rational way of thinking, if the safe route doesn't work then a DIY orchi shouldn't really be an option.

Unfortunately, though, there is still excessive gate-keeping in regards to orchiectomies. After all, why exactly do you think that self-castration attempts and "back-alley" castration attempts still occur nowadays?

An orchi isn't exactly a ton of money. Maybe work, safe, and be patient. You'll probably get there.

No, but it does involve excessive gate-keeping for aspiring eunuchs. 




 Thanks for this info, and I apologize for making you uncomfortable with these questions of mine. 




  First of all I just really hope you'll try your hardest to do it the safe and legal way, please, please, please try hard to do it that way!

Yes, I will certainly make sure to try extremely hard to get it done the legal and safe way. In fact, I will make it crystal-clear to the therapist at my university (once I will talk with him or her about this issue) that the alternative to safe, legal castration is self-castration or a "back-alley" castration on my part and that thus I extremely strongly prefer that I be given some safe, legal pathway to a safe, legal castration regardless of just how many roadblocks this pathway will have.

Basic tips: make sure all tools are sterilized and sharp (dull blades can lead to more injury).

What exactly should I use to sterilize these tools, though?

I suggest researching where your major blood vessels are to make sure you don't hit one of them.

Completely agreed.

Have 9-1-1 on speed dial and a phone right next to you in case anything goes wrong.

Yes, that certainly makes sense; that said, though, what about doing all of this in, say,a  private stall in a hospital bathroom? That way, I will be able to run to the emergency room shortly afterwards.

Make sure to leave skin to stitch the skin up so you don't have anything exposed.

I am not very good with stitching, though.

Have something like Bactine to put on the open wound to prevent infection

OK.

If anything goes wrong, get professional help, do not hesitate to go to the ER or call 9-1-1.

Completely agreed.

Also, though, what about using rubber bands, a burdizzo, and/or alcohol injections?

I really hope you can do it the safe route though, where professionals can do it and you have access to anesthetics.

Completely agreed; however, I am just not fond of the gate-keeping in regards to this and thus unfortunately have to be prepared for the tragic situation where the worst comes to pass. After all, I have already heard of some aspiring eunuchs who previously went down the self-castration and/or the "back-alley" castration route due to the fact that they could not get this done in a safe, medical setting. :( What a tragedy. :( Also, if you are curious, I identify as genderqueer. :) 




 What about using a burdizzo or rubber bands instead, though? 




 Thanks for this info. I just looked up what a scalpel is and it scared the Hell out of me! :( 




 Also, though, exactly what tool did this "surgeon" use to perform your orchiectomy? 




 Understood.

Anyway, if I will have any more questions about this, then I will make sure to ask you. :) 




 Wow! On exactly which websites did you get this information, though? 




 I am surprised that people advertise illegal surgeries such as this over the Internet, though. (After all, this surgery is illegal, correct?) 









 OK--basically, I (the OP here) am a 22-year-old gender-fluid/cross-dreaming male who would like to get castrated (Yes, castrated, as in getting my testicles removed) and is willing to do whatever it takes in order to get this done.

Now, why exactly do I want to get castrated? Well, first of all, I would like to get sterilized in a way which cannot ever fail (after all of the remaining sperm in my body already die off, that is). Vasectomies can fail, all other available contraceptives can fail, and as for Vasalgel, it is way too untested for me. Plus, I have never heard anyone give me an extremely good reason as for why exactly Vasalgel is incapable of ever failing. The fact that Vasalgel hasn't failed yet doesn't necessarily mean that it will never fail for anyone; after all, I would think that vasectomies likewise had a 100% effectiveness rate before the first historical vasectomy failure actually occurred.

Also, before anyone brings up the idea of me only having sex with women who share my own views in regards to pregnancy, I would like to point out that I would never rely on any woman's word that she will get an abortion (or give our hypothetical future offspring for adoption, for that matter); after all, a woman can simply change her mind on this later on.

Also, abstaining from vaginal sex with all fertile and potentially fertile women for the rest of my life is likewise both completely unrealistic and completely unacceptable for me.

Thus, I have to take matters into my own hands and seek out castration (Yes, castration, as in the removal of both of my testicles) by any means necessary. Afterwards, I will need to utilize hormone replacement therapy in order to deal with the less pleasant effects of castration.

Also, I would like to point out that I would like to regulate my sex drive and that, as a gender-fluid/cross-dreaming person, I might very well want to take female hormones after my planned castration if I am still (somehow) able to indefinitely get erections (using my penis, which I intend to keep indefinitely) afterwards. I mean, the idea of me becoming a six-foot-tall beauty strongly appeals to me, and not in a sexual way. Indeed, whenever I shave my face, I am always reminded of just how incredibly beautiful of a (trans-)woman I would make. :) However, at the same time, just to be safe, I want to keep all of my options open in regards to which hormone replacement therapy I should take after my planned castration (Yes, castration).

Anyway, what I am wondering is if anyone who is either a eunuch or a trans-woman can give me my advice in regards to utilizing hormone replacement therapy (either kind) and in regards to living a life without gonads in general. In addition, I would also like to hear about the sex lives of eunuchs, specifically in regards to erections, orgasm, et cetera, since this information is certainly of personal interest to me. Also, if anyone has any additional information which I might be interested in, then please don't hesitate to share this information with me!

Also, one more question--exactly how long will I need to wait after castration in order to be completely sure that all of the remaining sperm in my body are already dead?

And Yes, if anyone has any doubts in regards to this, this is certainly a completely serious post. 




  It's not hard to remove your testicles; the hard part is avoiding death, infection, and mangling the area.

In that case, do you have any advice on how exactly to reduce these risks? After all, I myself am personally curious about this in the tragic event that the worst will come to pass. 




  If you are ever so ready to go down the self route look at alcohol castration.

Please elaborate on this; after all, I myself am personally curious about this in the tragic event that the worst comes to pass. 




  If you don't bleed to death in the first few minutes

Holy shit! One can bleed to death *that* quickly from doing this? 




  I got an orchi from effectively a back alley 'surgeon' when I was 21 and I almost died of a massive infection.

Apologies for asking, but how exactly did you find such a surgeon in the first place? 




  What do you mean by that? Remember, unlike the US, Mexico has always been a very centralized country, more so in that era.

What I mean is that Mexico could have "thrown in the towel" and saved some, if not a lot of lives, by ending the war earlier. After all, Germany stopped fighting in World War I way before Allied troops would have been in Berlin.

The northern territories were vastly deserted, and few people lived there, so the Mexican army had little to think that losing those battles would lose them the war.

How exactly did Mexico plan to expel the U.S. from these northern territories, though?

If someone attacked Canada, and they occupy the northern territories, no one would say the war is decided. Now, the distances between Puebla, Veracruz, and Mexico City are not that large, and the bulk of the army was in Mexico City anyway, so it made sense to make the final stand there.

Was there ever any doubt that the U.S. would end up defeating Mexico in the end (including capturing Mexico City), though? 




 I personally strongly like them, but I have also heard some other people dismiss them and say that their music is "elevator music" and/or something along those lines.

Thus, what exactly are your own thoughts on the band Air Supply? 




 Why did Mexico fight on until the very end in the Mexican-American War? Did it seek to bleed the U.S. sufficiently dry in order to make the U.S. seek a compromise peace and in order to have the U.S. reduce at least some of its demands for Mexican territory? Or was there another reason for this?

Any thoughts on this? After all, in the Mexican-American War, the Mexican military was willing to do what the German military refused to do in World War I--specifically continue to fight a losing war all the way up to the very end, up to the point when enemy troops have already captured the Mexican capital. 




 Well, Ukraine gets some territory in exchange for losing some other territory. 




 What if Ukraine will get Transnistria (from Moldova) as territorial compensation for its loss of Crimea, though? 




 At least an East Pakistani could reach West Pakistan purely by sea, though. In contrast, a Muslim from Hyderabad certainly wouldn't have been able to do that. 




 But if I was a Russian nationalist, then I would never agree to that. After all, Kaliningrad represents the massively enormous bleeding that the Soviet Union endured during World War II in order to defeat and destroy the Nazi German regime. 




 Actually, that was the popular vote in New York state, whose electoral votes decided the outcome of this election. 




  Also, since we can't assume that British people in 1947 could see the future, does your plan include a partition of Hyderabad as well?

No, because Hyderabad does not have a common border with Pakistan. 









 By "Bundu," did you mean "Hindu"?

Also, though, wasn't there large-scale support in favor of partition among Indian Muslims (or at least in some/many/most Muslim-majority parts of British India)? 




 Completely agreed, which is why I intend to take hormone replacement therapy (specifically, estrogen). 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Oh! Anyway, thanks for this info, and goof luck with your future plans in regards to this. :) 









 Can Trump's outrageousness win him a new reality show, though? 




 Clickbait? 




 Donald Trump--once an ass, always an ass. ;) 




 Correlation does not necessarily equal causation, though. 




 Indeed, I think that the 1884 U.S. Presidential election was the closest one (percentage-wise) up to the 2000 U.S. Presidential election. 









 Being excessively lazy? 









 Good. :) 




 OK; good. :) 




  I lived in Korea and Germany and enjoyed both. I would never have fit in long term in Korea but I had a lot of German friends and could have easily and happily stayed there long term.

Thanks for this info. :) Also, out of curiosity, do you speak Korean and/or German fluently?

The problem with holding a vote is some people will vote one way and some the other.

And yet Britain managed to deal with this in Scotland, as did Canada in Quebec.

I would never tell a large group of Americans that they have to forcibly relocate or they are no longer American citizens.

You won't have to do either of these two things, though.

Also the federal govenrment has built infrastructure in every state and every state in effect has a share of the national debt I would not let a group vote to simply not pay their share of the debt.

What about if a U.S. state agrees to pay its share of the U.S. national debt before seceding, though? 




 I've really developed a soft spot for Pope Francis in spite of the fact that I am a Pastafarian. :) Seriously. :) 




 OK; fair enough, and for that, I apologize. 




 It states this on his website, though:

"Some doctors require letters from other physicians in order to have this surgery done.  This may or may not be required in your case."

The "may or maybe not be required in your case" part raises some questions in regards to this. 









 Where exactly outside of the U.S. did you live, though?

Also, for the record, the U.S. Civil War actually appears to be a poor example to use in regards to this. After all, I myself ideally support allowing a U.S. state to secede and yet would have still supported the Union in the U.S. Civil War due to the fact that the Confederacy was pro-slavery. 




 Also, out of curiosity--are you still able to get an erection using your penis right now (if/when you actually want to do this, that is)?

I apologize about asking this, but I am extremely curious about this due to the fact that this question is of personal interest to me. 




 I've got a question for you, though--would you support allowing any U.S. state to voluntarily secede from the U.S. if a majority of that state's voters wanted to secede from the U.S.? 




 From this article itself:

"

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected Mr. Azoulays remarks. In a statement, he described them as hurtful and said they do not reflect the position of the government. Mr. Netanyahu said he had spoken with Mr. Azoulay to remind him that Israel is a home for all Jews and that as minister of religious affairs, he serves all of Israels citizens.

" 




 I just want to test out the impact of testosterone on me in the event that I will be a eunuch (just to make sure that I would still be able to get erections and whatnot). After all, I want to keep all of my options open in regards to this just to be safe. 




  Actually the eunuch.org website recommends chemical castration using a T-blocker first to see how it is before getting an orchiectomy, just as /u/dnanyu suggested.

Yes, that certainly makes sense.

 Also not having either T or E can result in your bones becoming brittle.

Yes--due to osteoporosis, correct? 




  You are making a lot of hypothetical assumptions here. No one knows how things would have turned out. East Pakistan went to the Pakistan to match religious lines, but that eventually resulted in war and the creation of Bangladesh. No one saw that coming. Who's to say that Kashmir wouldn't have gone the same way?

Please pardon my ignorance in regards to this, but didn't East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) try seceding from Pakistan due to the fact that Bengali parties won a majority of the seats in the Pakistani government and yet were not allowed to form a governing coalition? If so, then this wouldn't work for Kashmir due to the fact that Kashmir has much less people than East Pakistan had.

 Hindu princes were willing to give up their territory to India, but if one of them was forced to give up his land to Pakistan, then all of them might have balked.

Which in turn is why I am advocating having Britain always make this decision in place of the princes. Yes, the princes were nominally sovereign, but this didn't really mean that much and Britain could have thus probably easily overrode the princes' will in regards to this.

 The Kashmiri people were split on religious grounds (although they were mostly Muslim,)

That's why I proposed partitioning Kashmir.

but the royal family was Hindu.

Yes; correct.

 Britain didn't want to upset the arrangement any more than they already had.

And that was a mistaken on Britain's part.

 There was already a lot of ill will between Pakistan and India.

Agreed, but that was due to the 1947 Indian partition and due to the previous Muslim-Hindu tensions. With Indian Muslims having their own state in Pakistan and thus allowed to determine their own destiny, Indo-Pakistani relations might have gradually become better over time.

Kashmir hasn't helped, but it certainly isn't the main motivating factor.

What exactly is your basis for this statement, though?

There are hundreds of years of bad blood between those countries, and it's hard to say that things would be different with just one change.

It is worth noting, though, that as far as I know, Hindu-Muslim relations in South Asia were previously never as strained as they became in the 1930s or 1940s and beyond. 




 So should I post this thought as my own Shower Thought here? Serious question, for the record. 




 Exactly what country are you from, though? 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Nobody? ;) As in, not even one person? ;) 




 Great to hear! :) Hopefully this will provide additional "ammunition" for the pro-marijuana legalization side to use against our opponents! :) 




 Agreed; that said, though, I wonder if I can try out testosterone blockers with estrogen and then with testosterone just in case. I mean, I might very well prefer to use estrogen (at least most of the time), but I do want to keep all of my post-orchiectomy options available just in case. 




 Hopefully this is a new thread topic here.

Anyway, my argument here is this:

If the British would have partitioned Kashmir along religious lines in 1947 (with the Muslim-majority areas going to Pakistan and the Hindu-majority and Buddhist-majority areas going to India), then there would have been no decades-long Kashmir dispute and conflict. In turn, this would have meant that several tens of thousands of people who got killed in real life would not have gotten killed (as a result of the warfare over Kashmir).

In addition to this, Pakistan might not have went nuclear without the Kashmir dispute, which in turn might have meant that there would not have been a risk of a nuclear war in South Asia in the 1990s and beyond. Likewise, without the Kashmir dispute, Pakistan's military and intelligence service might not be as pampered and might not have as much influence as they actually have in real life.

Also, with less Indo-Pakistani tensions, both India and Pakistan would have been able to spend more money on things such as economic development and mutual cooperation instead of spending that money on their militaries (armed forces).

In addition to this, while  the war over Bangladesh might have still happened (whether in 1971 or in a different year) without the Kashmir dispute, this war in itself might not have derailed Indo-Pakistani relations in the long(er)-run. After all, Pakistan only lost Bangladesh due to the fact that it was committing genocide there and thus indirectly caused a humanitarian crisis to occur next door in India (as a result of millions of Bangladeshi refugees fleeing to India).

Anyway, does anyone here have any thoughts on this? 




 Actually, California first needs to successfully secede from the Union in order to become a Great Power in its own right. ;) 




 California, here we come! Right back where we started from! California! ;) 




 Yes, I certainly understand all of that. :)

Also, for what it's worth, I'd like to try out testosterone blockers and estrogen as soon as possible (say, within one year or so). If I will like them (especially estrogen), then I will continue using them (and some of the effects of estrogen, such as the increased emotions, actually sound very appealing to me). In addition, it is worth noting that perhaps these testosterone blockers and estrogen will allow me to get a better picture of my own gender identity (as appears to have previously been the case for some other male-to-female cross-dreamers).

In addition to this, though, an orchiectomy also has sterilization value for me considering that all other contraceptives and sterilizations, including vasectomies, can fail. Frankly, I myself certainly need to be sterilized in a way which cannot ever fail (after freezing some of my sperm, of course). 




 Would France have tolerated the existence of a Communist government in Spain, though? 




 Thanks for this info; thus, I wonder if this might depend on the person. 




 OK, but wouldn't one need to take hormone replacement therapy in addition to testosterone blockers in order to eliminate the risk of depression? 









 The Saudis would beg to differ with him on that. 




 Ah Yes--I still remember when I myself played Yu-Gi-Oh 10+ years ago. :) 




 I don't think that the Western Allies would have been interested in a separate peace with Germany with or without the Nazis. After all, as far as I know, FDR viewed all of Germany, rather than only the Nazis, as being the problem. Plus, Churchill wouldn't have went against FDR on this considering that the U.S. was essentially Britain's "sugar daddy" during this time. 




 Thank you very much! :) 




  Ah. TIL something new.

Yeah, take a look at the pre-Operation Barbarossa front lines:

http://omniatlas.com/maps/europe/19410621/

True, but the Soviets are prepared to go full scorched earth on the Germans. Had they (the Germans) fortified their positions, they may have to fight a bigger Red Army, but they themselves would also be better supplied, would have higher morale, can have better air support and would not have to engage in so much street fighting.

Sure, but it still wouldn't have been enough for the Germans to win. In fact, I am unsure if the Germans could have even bled the Soviet Union sufficiently dry in order to make it a draw--after all, if the Soviet Union becomes visibly weakened, then the Western Allies might be compelled to send some of their own troops to the Eastern Front in order to help the Soviet Union out. 









  Didn't he went through Ukraine to get to Russia?

Yes, he did, but that was only *after* he invaded the Soviet Union.

I think he should've just taken control of Ukraine, strengthen the supply lines and position there first, then strike Russia proper.

Yes, Hitler could have done that, but that would have also given the Red Army more time to prepare and to recover. 




 Yep. *Shudders* :( 




 This is certainly extremely great news! :) 




 Unless they have or previously had a penis, that is. 




 Unless they are trans-women and have or had a penis, that is. 




 Ukraine and the Baltic states take Putin pretty seriously, though. 




 Yes, very possibly. :) 




 Hitler didn't control Ukraine before the invaded the Soviet Union, though. 




 Yep. 




  Wow. In hindsight, the reliance on horses is probably a mistake.

Agreed; after all, it's 1941, not 1841.

 ... 'course, in hindsight, the invasion of the Soviet Union is probably a bigger mistake.

Actually, I am not so sure about that. After all, if a Nazi-Soviet war was inevitable, then couldn't it have been better for Hitler to strike sooner rather than later? 









 It was still Constantinople back then, though.  




 From this very same article:

"
Sukhomlinovs opinion piece sent a clear message to friend and foe alike, including Germany, where its inflammatory rhetoric only stoked paranoia about encirclement. When Kaiser Wilhelm received a translated version he scribbled angry notes in the margins, noting that Russias strategic railroads were All against Germany! and concluding Well! Finally the Russians have shown their hand. Any person in Germany who does not now believe that the Russo-Gauls are not working together at high tension for a war with us very soon and that we should take corresponding counter-measures deserves to be sent to the lunatic asylum 

A few days alter Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg passed the article along to the German ambassador to London, Prince Lichnowsky, with this gloomy note: The reaction on German public opinion has been unmistakable and serious. Whereas formerly, it was only the extremists among the Pan-Germans and militarists who urged that Russia was making systematic preparation for a war of aggression upon us very soon, even moderate public men are now inclined to this view
"

For the record, Franz Ferdinand was assassinated just 15 days after Sukhomlinovs opinion piece was written. 














 What is nobody's business but the Turks'? 




 May he RIP. :( While I have never watched any of his movies, I have heard that he was a good actor. :( 









 I think that almost all of the Sudeten Germans were expelled regardless of whether or not they actively supported Nazi Germany. In fact, I think that the only Sudeten Germans (5% or so of the total Sudeten German population) who were allowed to stay were those who either had crucial skills which could not be replaced or those who were married to ethnic Czechs. 









 What about if you're a Black guy in Central Africa, though? 




 I am still a college student, but I might as well put my dad's profession here (since I'm pretty sure that he qualifies for this):

Computer programmer and a manager of several people at his job. 









  Yup, and kicking a particular ethnicity out of a country is still a form of genocide.

So the post-World War II expulsion of the Sudeten Germans was a form of genocide? 




 Yeah man! Completely agreed, unfortunately. :( 




 And events such as this are why some/many Israelis are concerned by the idea of an Iran with nuclear weapons. 




 And the Alaouite (sp?) Dynasty couldn't have modernized Morocco without French (and Spanish) help? After all, starting from the late 19th century, Japan was able to modernize by itself, no? 




 I apologize for asking, but did it hurt (for your girlfriend, that is)? 




 OK--as a genderqueer person who wants to become a (physical) eunuch, here is my question: Can getting an orchiectomy before one begins hormone replacement therapy result in depression? After all, I have heard that the effect that an orchiectomy has on one's hormone levels can result in depression.

Any thoughts on this? Also, Yes, this is a completely serious question, for the record. 




 It's great that the Roman Catholic Church has finally apologized for the previous sins of Catholics in the New World. :) After all, an extremely late apology is certainly better than no apology at all. :) 




 Except by us Pastafarians, that is. :) 




 Yep. :) 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Any thoughts on this?

Also, having World War I break out a couple of years sooner might accomplish this. 




 In spite of this, though, Trump is still a joke candidate. 




 You forgot hot Korean women and the best food anywhere in North Korea. ;) 




 And how exactly is this meaningfully different from making Hitler jokes? After all, Lil' Kim probably still had a long way before he will catch up to Hitler in terms of brutality. 




 Well, wasn't Kim's grandfather hand-picked by Stalin to lead North Korea? If so, then this might explain a lot. 




  I would rather have him deposed, and tried for crimes against the North Korean people in an international court, facing life in prison.

Life is prison? Why not death instead? 




 Well, Lil' Kim *could* try organizing a Night of the Long Knives-style event in North Korea if he really wanted to. ;) 




  They are not, which is why they've tried to assassinate him (thwarted by a traffic lady)

Source, please? 





























 Thanks for this info. :) 




 So talent agents look for people who are singing and dancing at public places such as restaurants? 





























 Great to hear! :) Frankly, we should hear about these kinds of stories more often. :) Seriously. :) 




 Yes, you are even more important than coal. :) 




 Good! :) After all, doesn't coal help contribute to climate change? 




  1/4000 x 18/100=0.0045%. Those are your odds of knocking a girl up with both forms of contraception in place.

I don't think that you are calculating this correctly. However, even if so, since these odds aren't good enough for at least some pro-choicers in the hypothetical event of an abortion ban, these odds likewise aren't good enough for me.

Plus, I have heard that condoms reduce sexual pleasure and intimacy. Thus, I certainly don't intend to wear a condom all of the time (though sometimes condoms might be necessary to wear for STD protection).

Outside of user error you're looking at even lower odds.

Yes, but I always take user error into consideration.

Honestly this is a really poor reason to make a decision like this and any licensed professional specializing in gender identity issues will be very very disinclined to provide you with what you want if you mention this as one of your reasons. Remember that it's part of a gender therapist's job to weed out the transgender's from the mere fetishists.

You might very well have a point here; however, I nevertheless need to do a test run on female hormones and anti-androgens just to see their impact on me. After all, I certainly can't keep this metaphorical box locked forever.

Plus, transitioning for fetishistic reasons is a bad remove since female hormones might very well reduce one's sex drive.

 Alright look. After talking with you a little bit I honestly think you should do you, whatever you decide that is. It's just... what you were asking was a little concerning is all.

That's all. Just a little concerned about you.

Understood, and thanks for caring. :) Seriously. :) Also, though, for the record, I will certainly discuss all of these issues with a therapist at my university and then decide how exactly I should proceed from there. :) That sounds like a good plan--correct? 




  It's not quite a language disconnect. You can usually tell from a person's writing voice that english isn't their first language. Generally they make bizarre syntax choices or use phrases/words in a manner that isn't necessarily incorrect but isn't quite right either. But the writing is still filled with emotional context.

OK.

 That's not what I detected here. Rather there's a weird level of emotional detachment to your writing. You come across as a fleshy computer making a logistical decision, not a trans person attempting to alleviate an emotional condition.

Well, the thing is that I am not a transgender person in the conventional/binary sense (I mean, I wish that I was a binary trans-woman, but I'm not). However, I could very well identify as gender-fluid/genderqueer/neutrois. Basically, I don't have much problems with living as an extremely feminine man for the rest of my life. However, I also often daydream about the idea of me being a woman, including having a female brain/mind and everything. Indeed, the concept of autogynephilia (in a broad sense--rather than only in a sexual sense) appears to describe me pretty well. (Yes, I am aware of the BS conclusions that transphobes have made form the autogynephilia concept, and I certainly don't agree with those BS conclusions.) Frankly, if I will live long enough and we will develop successful technology to change one's gender identity without significantly changing one's sexuality in the process, then I would probably seek to utilize this technology myself sooner or later. Seriously. After all, if I could become the (trans-)woman of my daydreams in every way, then why not do this at some point in my lifetime?

Also, for what it's worth, I previously discussed my history of cross-gender feelings here: http://www.crossdreamlife.com/viewtopic.php?f=1 t=2519

I also made some other posts on that forum which might interest you (under the username "Futurist"). Thus, please feel free to check out what exactly I wrote on that forum. :)

Given that, I'm not saying that this is actually the case, merely that your writing voice is so devoid of emotional context that it appears to be the case. I have no idea what is actually lurking under the surface of your mind.

Well, maybe now you have a somewhat better picture of what exactly is actually lurking under the surface of my mind. :)

 The last person I got to know pretty well who was asperger's was also trans (FtM for the record). He didn't describe gender dysphoria (though that doesn't mean it wasn't there, I don't know his life like that) but seemed to think men get more respect in society and thus wanted to be identified as a man. It was less about who he innately saw himself as and more about his place in the herd and I can't help but wonder if you're not coming from a similar place. You seem to be under the impression that this choice your making will allow you to fill some role you see for yourself.

Actually, I think that my own case is different from the case of the trans-man whom you are describing here.

 People on the autism spectrum in general don't seem to be strongly gendered in the classical sense and I'm personally inclined to think it comes with the territory of autism.

For all I know, you could be correct in regards to this.

Your dysphoria over your hairiness could also be a byproduct of ASD, less related to any ideas you have about gender and more just something your autistic brain cooked up as being unappealing.

Actually, it's not just that; after all, my excessive hairiness is also preventing me from cross-dressing, which I strongly want to do sometimes. :(

 I'm not saying you shouldn't try to be whatever flavor of gender you want, cause buddy I'm the last person to try and talk you down from that. But I'm I personally believe that you're autistic and that your condition as such is coloring your choices.

OK.

You really need to speak to a professional before making any sort of permanent decisions about your body.

OK, and will do! :) 




  How certain are you that this is actually bullet-proof?

Castration? More certain than I am for anything else. (Of course, there can be a possibility of some testicle cells accidentally not being removed or the possibility of 1+ extra testicles existing somewhere else in one's body.) Of course, I could get my vas deferens snipped, cauterized, and tied in addition to getting castrated. After all, one is not incompatible with the other.

 1 in 4000 is an incredibly low number.

And yet it is not good enough either for pro-choicers in the hypothetical event of an abortion ban or for me.

After all, these types of odds mean that out of every 10,000 male-bodied people who get this done, there is a whopping 92% chance that at least one of these male-bodied people's vasectomies will fail.

Combined with condoms and you're as close to bulletbabyproof as you can get on this earth.

I hate to break it to you, but condoms by themselves have about an 18% annual failure rate if one takes use error into account (as I always do). Also, that's just for one year--imagine what the data would look like for 10, 20, 30, et cetera years!

As I said before--my views on the risk are based on those of pro-choice people in the hypothetical event of an abortion ban. After all, I have hard pro-choicers complain many, many times to politically anti-abortion people about the risk of contraception failure and sterilization failure.

No no no. Hormones can have dangerous side-effects and it's not something you take for funsies. Seriously.

Yes, I agree that one always needs to be on the look-out for negative side-effects of hormone replacement therapy. However, it is also worth pointing out that, as far as I know, trans-men live about as long as cis-men do. Likewise, I would think that trans-women wouldn't live much less than cis-women do if one takes transphobia out of the picture.

Furthermore you could end up growing tits which kind of runs counter to your goal of a more androgynous look.

So do you have a way of taking female hormones and not growing tits?

Also, it is worth noting that tits can be hidden and that I can get surgery to remove my tits later on if I will get desperate. Also, for the record, some cis-men also have female-like breasts and even female-like nipples.

If the hair bothers you get it lasered off.

Yes, that's what I intend to do for the rest of my body, along with electrolysis for my face.

 Go see a real doctor not some idiot you talked to on a message board.

Agreed. Of course, it is worth noting that I could also try out anti-androgens and female hormones (preferably with the help of a doctor) and see if I will like them. It other words, it would be a test run of sorts. :)

 Someone with credentials needs to talk you down from this ledge.

We'll see about that.

 I have no idea what you even mean by this or what kind of expectations you've placed on blocking testosterone production in your body. I sense that things will not work out the way you hope, however.

What I mean is that I would like to reduce my sex drive and also to give sexual arousal more meaning by making orgasms longer. After all, I currently orgasm too quickly, which in turn reduces the meaning and value of orgasms for me.

Also, again, there is always the possibility of doing a test run with anti-androgens and with female hormones before I will decide whether or not to proceed with surgical castration. :) In addition, though, I have to try out anti-androgens and female hormones in any case in order to get a clearer picture of my own gender identity. While I obviously have some cross-gender feelings, I'd like to see if these feelings are even deeper than I realize. Frankly, doing this previously helped some other cross-dreamers get a clearer picture of their own gender identity; thus, perhaps doing this will likewise do the same for me. :) 




 Actually, becoming a eunuch by cutting off my testicles with scissors is way worse than injecting alcohol into my testicles. After all, I have heard that the scissors route can result in me being dead in several minutes as a result of massive blood loss. :( 




  I don't intend any insult with this question, but have you ever been diagnosed on the autism spectrum?

No, but I suspect that I might have Asperger's and/or some amount of OCD.

Also, though, for what it's worth, English is not my first language. Thus, maybe this helps make my writing voice off-putting (which, for the record, I sincerely apologize for). 




 Don't worry--after all, I certainly intend to discuss all of this with a therapist at my university once my summer vacation is over and then take it from there. :) 




 He was still an anti-Semite when he discovered this news, though. This is why I didn't write "former" in my thread title here. 









 Out of curiosity--won't all of the British intelligence files in regards to Rudolf Hess's death likewise come out in 2017? 




 Hopefully this question is okay to ask here.

Anyway, who exactly are your favorite androgynous fictional characters?

As for me, Dio Eraclea from Last Exile would definitely be either at or near the top of my list in regards to this. :) 




  I DO hope you get through this in a safe, medical setting. Good luck with your aspirations!

Thank you very much! :)

 Just don't do something based on something some moron on the interwebs said.

Believe me--I would strongly prefer to get this done in a safe, medical setting. Let us just seriously hope that gate-keeping among doctors won't prevent me from getting this done in a safe, medical setting, though. 




  I feel like you are having a bit of dysmorphia about your sack.

Maybe, but if so, at least I have practical reasons for this dysmorphia.

 You can't couch your issues in different flavors to solve your goals man, thats not logical. You should understand that the lack of testosterone from a full castration will make you not care about that stuff nearly as much as you do now.

Oh sure, but I will still have a romantic attraction to some women, now wouldn't I?

 You could find yourself alone and confused from lack of drive to pursue others. These are things you might not learn by asking one sided questions.

While I might have less drive to pursue others sexually, I will still have a lot of drive to pursue others romantically. Plus, it's not like women have zero sex drive.

 I have balls but no sex drive, enough that I worry about taking testosterone supplements.

Exactly how old are you, though?

 I ruined several relationships because neither of us understood how to talk about the problem.

I am sorry to hear that. :(

 I hope you can find someone to talk to about your sexual needs and help you to find an answer that is beneficial to you before you do something drastic.

How about a therapist at my university, though?

I'm glad to pm in further if you like.

OK; thus, go ahead and do this! :) Seriously. :) 




 OK; good. :) 




 The worst way to do what, exactly? 




 Also, for the record, I will also allow you to read this explanation of mine in regards to this (I previously typed it up for another poster here):

I have three goals with an orchiectomy:

1. To achieve "bullet-proof" sterilization. Since all non-drastic methods of contraception and sterilization (including vasectomies) can and sometimes do fail, they are just not good enough for me.

2. If my expectations in regards to female hormones will turn out to be accurate, then I would want to use female hormones on a regular or at least on a semi-regular basis. After all, I have heard good things about female hormones from both trans-women and trans-men. However, I must find some way to still be able to get erections using my penis, as well as to still be able to have penis-in-vagina sex, while I am taking female hormones, since otherwise female hormones might not work for me.

3. To better regulate my sex drive and to give my ejaculations and sexual arousal more meaning.

In addition to this, though, independently of that, I also want to permanently get rid of as much of my body hair and facial hair as possible due to the fact that this hair makes me dysphoric (and I unfortunately have a lot of it, so yeah). Likewise, I want to feminize my face to some extent as well, though I still want to live as a man (albeit as a very feminine eunuch) most (but not all) of the time after I will get all of this done. 




 No problem! :) 




 Hopefully this question is okay to ask here.

Anyway, who exactly are your favorite androgynous fictional characters?

As for me, Dio Eraclea from Last Exile would definitely be either at or near the top of my list in regards to this. :) 




 Haha! 




 Actually, I *am* extremely paranoid in regards to unplanned pregnancy. You can thank pro-choicers for instilling a zero tolerance of risk in me in regards to this. Seriously. After all, I heard pro-choicers complain many, many times about contraception and sterilization failure. However, unlike these pro-choicers, I simply don't have the option of abortion in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, which in turn means that I absolutely cannot risk an unplanned pregnancy in the first place. Also, abstaining from sex with all fertile and potentially fertile women for the rest of my life is both completely unrealistic and completely unacceptable for me.

However, in addition to this, I did say that I am interested in using female hormones and reducing my sex drive, both of which is accurate. After all, I have heard (from both trans-women and trans-men) that female hormones make one more emotional, which is certainly something that I want. Plus, having a lower sex drive would be a good thing since it will allow me to focus more on other things but also allow me to have sex when I will want to. Plus, I have heard that female hormones increase the length of one's orgasm and make one body sexually aroused in a different way, both of which I would certainly like to try out. Also, I would like to have a more feminine face so that I would develop a more androgynous appearance.

In addition to this, though, I absolutely hate all of my body hair and facial hair and thus want to permanently get rid of as much of it as possible. This hair makes me feel dysphoric and I would prefer that all of it simply disappeared and never grew back. After all, I would like to have a more feminine and "clean" appearance as well as to cross-dress at times. 




 Well, I would strongly prefer to become a eunuch in a safe, medical setting. Thus, let us seriously hope that I will succeed in doing this. 




 A 0.07% chance of an unplanned pregnancy isn't good enough for some/many pro-choice females in the hypothetical event of an abortion ban. Thus, these odds likewise aren't good enough for me either.

As for injecting 190 proof alcohol into my testicles, I would only do it as a last resort if I could not become a eunuch in a safe, medical setting (which is my strong preference in regards to this). 




 You said it, cowboy (or cowgirl)! ;) 




 Oh, sure, the Iran fear-mongers have been wrong numerous times before! 




 But I will get to the emergency room in time to prevent it from killing me. 




 It's a different photo, though. 




 Yes, you can phrase it that way 









  That would SUCK!! I'm glad you made a solid recovery from that...

Thank you very much! :) Also, for the record, I had surgery done to eliminate my huge (1.3 cm) underbite a year ago. The recovery process from that surgery was extremely brutal (but I did fully recover in the end).

but injecting almost straight alcohol into your scrote?!? That may fucking kill you! There is blood flow there and it will go to your brain. I would not do this, what so ever!

Believe me--I will try extremely hard to get this done in a safe, medical setting before I will try doing this. Also, though, as far as I know, some people did previously succeed in using alcohol injections to destroy the function of their testicles. 




 Because even it isn't bulletproof; plus, remember--women have the option of abortion, whereas I certainly don't have this option (and I never rely on any woman's word that she will get an abortion in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, so yeah). 




 Actually, as far as I know, eunuchs still have some testosterone left in their bodies--just much less than before.

Also, as far as I know, Viagra and/or some amount of additional testosterone can help with the erections. Of course, interestingly enough, I did talk to some trans-women on Reddit who still have their penises (but not their testicles) and who are still able to get erections using their penises as well as to still have penis-in-vagina sex. 




 Thank you very much! :) 




 Here's what I have found in regards to late failures:

https://www.vasweb.com/vasectomy_faqs.html

"From these four cases and reports in the literature, late failure resulting in pregnancy is possible but rare, odds being about one in 4000, a rate of failure much lower than with any other form of contraception."

Also, re-canalization can occur in between tests. 









 Also, take a look at the info here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasectomy#Efficacy_as_contraception

"A 2005 systematic review of twenty-eight studies including both early failures and late failures described a total of 183 failures or recanalizations from approximately 43,642 vasectomy patients (0.4%), and twenty studies in the same review described sixty pregnancies after 92,184 vasectomies (0.07%).[29]" 




 Done! :) Also, thank you very much for this advice! :) 




 Many people. 









 Yes, many Republicans are warmongers; what exactly did you expect? 









 You're banging some Persian chick? ;) 




  Good luck.

Thank you very much! :)

Also, what about rubbing alcohol. Aren't those often sold at 90% abv

I am honestly unsure; please let me ask the people at the Transgender reddits what exactly their own thoughts on this are, though. 




 It might be less painful than accidentally almost completely tearing off one of my pinky toes, though. Yes, I had to endure that as a result of an accident nine years ago; thankfully I was able to get stitches afterwards in order to successfully reattach my toe to the rest of my body, though. :) Seriously. 




 And why exactly would you read about me on the news? 




 Thanks! :) 




 Well, I have three goals with an orchiectomy:

1. To achieve "bullet-proof" sterilization. Since all non-drastic methods of contraception and sterilization (including vasectomies) can and sometimes do fail, they are just not good enough for me.

 Also, an ER trip is very likely going to be much cheaper than child support payments. 




 OK; let me say this, though--you win some, and you lose some. 




 Vasectomies aren't 100% effective, though. 




 OK; fair enough, I suppose.

Thus, should I delete this TIL? 














 Says you. ;) 




 Yes, that might be at least a part of the reason for this. 




 For one, my desire for sterilization which is incapable of *ever* failing. 




 Actually, we *do* currently have tools which allow women to pee standing up. :) 
























 That's OK. In any case, I was primarily curious about the legality of this.

For the record, I still hope to become a eunuch in a safe, medical setting. However, if this will not be possible, then I might very well travel to a U.S. state where 190 proof is legal and then damage my testicles there to the point where they no longer work. 




 By injecting this alcohol into their testicles using a syringe, no? 




 A male-bodied person without testicles, of course. 




  In any case please do try to exhaust all of your options before resorting to this.

Completely agreed. :) 




 To put it bluntly, I want to use 190 proof in order to severely damage my testicles in the event that I will be unable to become a eunuch in a safe, medical setting. Yes, I am completely serious about this; after all, apparently some other aspiring eunuchs previously did this and successfully achieved their desired result. 




  As far as consumption goes, you're not going to find a big difference between the 151 proof everclear that you can buy in california and the 190 proof you can buy in other states.

Thanks for this info. That said, though, what about for other uses of this? 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Also, out of curiosity, would a series of Everclear alcohol injections to the testicles work for this? 




 Yeah, as far as I know, unlike the Iranian government, ordinary Iranians (especially the younger generation) are actually quite pro-American. :) 









  That's a tough one. If being 'transgender' means having a female brain in a male body (and vice versa), then what does simply being gay mean? You feel like a man but you desire men. Seems like a grey area.

Being gay means that you have sexual desires similar to those of heterosexual people of the opposite gender.

I don't think that's fair. "You're a man who likes women but all women are gay, so let's chop your dick off."

If this comes with a change in one's gender identity, then let's go for it! :) After all, I myself would certainly volunteer for this! :) Seriously.

But honestly, yes, it's very troubling. The best case scenario for pedophiles is to watch child pornography and try to stop thinking about ever having real sex. Can you imagine that being the BEST life you can have?

Or they could simply have sex with adults (perhaps with adults who are dressed like children if they are *that* desperate).

Also, Yes, this would certainly be tragic (plus, it is worth noting that actual child porn, as opposed to cartoon child porn, is obviously illegal). However, it's not like we have any better options at this point in time (well, other than surgical castration--seriously). 




 Yeah, that's where I got the idea from this post from. :) Deal with it! ;) 




  Gender identity isn't the same as sexual attraction,

No, it isn't, but this will easily solve the problem in regards to this. (Heck, as a side note, I want to become a lesbian trans-woman even in this current world. Seriously.)

Also, though, as a side note, I wouldn't be surprised if the process by which one becomes transgender in the womb is similar to the process by which one becomes gay in the womb. Seriously. After all, I have previously read that both gay people and transgender people have feminized/masculinized brains relative to the sex that they were assigned at birth.

but I see what you're saying.

Yes--if you can't deal with the status quo, then there should ideally be some way to change the status quo without harming anyone.

Yes, I highly doubt any pedophile would rather stay a pedophile.

Yes; correct! In turn, this is why I strongly hope that a cure for pedophilia (probably by altering one's brain in some way) will eventually be found.

However, for the time being, pedophiles should be offered treatment and counselling. Likewise, any pedophile (and any other adult, for that matter) who genuinely wants to become a eunuch should be able to do so in a safe, medical setting. Seriously. 




 Out of curiosity--have you ever seriously considered becoming a eunuch? After all, becoming a eunuch (as in, getting rid of your testicles) will probably permanently get rid of most of your sex drive. Also, Yes, I am completely serious about all of this.

 




  Being a pedophile is just like being a straight male in a world where all females are lesbians. The obvious result is that you'd have sexual desires that cannot be met without hurting someone.

I really hope that technology to change one's gender identity exists in such a scenario; after all, I'd certainly like to turn myself into a lesbian trans-woman. :) 









 As every *currently living* person on Earth, that is. 




 OK; thanks for this info, and good luck with your future plans in regards to this! :) 




  No, no I didn't. I was referring to HRT.

Oh; OK. That said, though, did you get an orchiectomy yet?

 Abortion is not exactly a walk in the park.

No, but it *is* a piece of cake in comparison to an orchiectomy.

In any case, what I meant is that, if it is difficult even getting a vasectomy, getting an orchiectomy will be even more difficult.

Agreed, unfortunately. :( 




  I really have no idea. I am in Europe, and am DIY for the moment, so my info is limited to wild guesses.

Wait--you actually performed your orchiectomy yourself?

I think you may be facing more than a bit of opposition, though. I remember reading of people who had a lot of difficulties for a simple vasectomy/tubal, so there's that.

In regards to a tubal litigation, though, a woman who could not get a tubal litigation done could simply get an abortion afterwards (and a second abortion if the first abortion fails, and so forth); thus, it is less pressing (in other words, less urgent) than me becoming a eunuch. 




 Also, out of curiosity--exactly how difficult do you think it will be for me to find a doctor who will be willing to perform an elective orchiectomy on me? 




  A more fair comparison would be getting kicked in the crotch by the Hulk. There is a world of difference between a sudden impact and cutting in.

OK; understood.

 Of course, going off cyproterone would lead to a (slow) reversal of most of its effect. It might just leave you permanently sterile.

The key word here is "might." "Might" isn't good enough for me, considering that I want something which is guaranteed to leave me permanently sterile.

 Regarding 2), after removal of the testes erections will be more difficult and you will likely experience shrinkage. You could always take T and/or viagra to avoid this.

Yes, I am well-aware of this. Thus, I should discuss this with a gender therapist before I will actually become a eunuch.

 If you take estrogens (even anti-androgens/orchiectomy cause this, to an extent) you will feminize. Breasts included.

As long as I can still pass as a man (even an extremely feminine man), though, then this shouldn't be a problem. After all, even some cis-men have large breasts and even female nipples. (Plus, there is the option of breast removal and/or breast reduction surgery later on if necessary; frankly, I appear to be largely indifferent in regards to breasts.)

And you need either estrogen or testosterone to avoid osteoporosis, so this might be a problem.

Yes, I am certainly well-aware of that, which is why I intend to always take at least one of these two hormones. 




  The crotch has way more nerves than your pinky. I really doubt you would be able to deal with the pain, especially if you are trying to do an orchiectomy at the same time.

OK, though for the record, I did previously get kicked in the crotch by some idiot (back in middle school) nine or ten years ago and managed to survive it.

And, while I don't know exactly how much blood flows to the testicular artery, I know that you can bleed out in seconds if you cut the wrong artery/vein. Thus, even being near or inside an hospital might not be enough.

OK; thank you very much for this information.

I'm not suggesting cyproterone acetate as a long-term solution. I was under the impression that you wanted to attempt a DIY orchiectomy now, and while it may not be good on the long-term it would certainly be effective in shutting them down and making them shrink.

OK, but what about if one goes off of cyproterone acetate? Would the testicles then go back to normal?

Regarding gatekeeping - tell your doctors that you are going to do it, with or without your help. It might help or it might not, but if you really are determined in going through with it they should - least harm - help you do so safely.

Completely agreed. In fact, this is what I am going to tell the therapist at my university at the start of the Fall 2015 quarter (I am currently on summer vacation, so yeah). I haven't talked with him or her at all yet; thus, I will need to discuss everything, including this, with him or her.

As always, IANAD.

Thanks for this disclaimer. :)

Also, for the record, I have three goals with an orchiectomy:

1. To achieve "bullet-proof" sterilization. Since all non-drastic methods of contraception and sterilization (including vasectomies) can and sometimes do fail, they are just not good enough for me.

2. If my expectations in regards to female hormones will turn out to be accurate, then I would want to use female hormones on a regular or at least on a semi-regular basis.

  I answered you in another thread, but I'll answer you here, too. Always remember that IANAD.

OK.

DIY surgery is, as a rule, a very bad idea. Even quite simple field surgery (extracting bullets and shrapnel) is dangerous if you are not trained. And even if you have training infection is a pretty big risk.

OK.

And a DIY orchiectomy seems to me like a doubly bad idea, because:
The area is highly innervated - this means that the surgery will be quite painful.

I think that I can deal with this pain, though. After all, I previously (nine years ago) accidentally almost completely ripped one of my pinky toes from the rest of my body; it hurt like Hell and I had to get stitches afterwards to reattach this toe (Yes, this stitching was thankfully successful).

The testicles are fed by the testicular artery, and if you clip/cut/damage it you will likely bleed out.

What about doing this in the private stall of a restroom right outside of a hospital emergency room, though?

Now, if you:

...

 There would be no problems. But that would not be DIY surgery anymore, would it?

No, it would not. Thus, would even seeking a "cutter" to do this be a better move than doing it oneself?

 You aren't trained as a surgeon. You won't know how deep you have to go or how deep you can go or how you have to cut or what you have to cut. It's likely that you won't have the precision needed to operate safely, even if you knew exactly what you need to do.
You don't have access to sterile equipment. This means infection and possibly gangrene.
You don't have access to local anesthetic. This means that you will have to bear through the pain - and there will be a lot of pain, risking that a spasm will kill you or something - or take painkillers/alcohol and thus impairing your concentration/precision.
You are operating on yourself. That means a difficult angle, that means having to suffer through the pain of the operation and having to do it.

Yes, you appear to be correct in regards to this.

Other than cutting into your scrotum and removing your testicles, there are other methods to kill them. But safely? They are likely relatively more safe than DIY an orchiectomy, but they are not safe.
Clamping them with an elastic band would work. You will need to keep the band firmly in place until your testicles fall off (I think they autoamputate - any doctors here?). But this will be extremely painful and not without risks. Your testicles will basically rot, and if you remove the band you will likely die from shock.

OK; thus, if I will get really desperate, then I might do this. However, where exactly do I get an elastic band?

 TL;DR: don't DIY an orchiectomy. Might I suggest cyproterone acetate instead?

No, cyproterone acetate is certainly *not* going to be an acceptable long(er)-term replacement for an orchiectomy. Rather, my testicles *have* to come off, and I absolutely cannot compromise in regards to this.

Also, for the record, I still seek to become a eunuch in safe, medical setting (well, once I will raise the money for this and for HRT, that is). However, I am asking about a DIY orchiectomy here in the event that the tragic worst-case scenario comes to pass in regards to this. After all, I know that there is an awful lot of excessive gate-keeping in regards to aspiring eunuchs who want to get elective orchiectomies, which in turn results in some of these aspiring eunuchs attempting DIY orchiectomies and/or "back-alley" orchiectomies instead. :(

 Edit: I cannot words at 04:21. I should really be sleeping.

OK. 




 OK; I will make sure to read what they have to say in regards to this. 




 Didn't the Muslim League (running on a pro-secession and pro-Pakistan platform) overwhelmingly win in the Muslim-majority areas in the 1946 election, though? 
























 Yes; this article got that part wrong. 




  Exactly how is it better?

Well, it's no longer in the Middle Ages.

The US invasion has failed to eliminate the Taliban,

Yes, but I am unsure that fully eliminating the Taliban is necessary.

who happen to be still strong as ever,

Eh ... I'm not so sure about that; after all, isn't Pakistan cracking down on some of the sanctuary areas in Pakistan which the Taliban have previously used?

the Afghan government does not control large swathes of the country

Give them time, though.

and their security services are in no way prepared to handle the whole country by themselves.

Not yet; however, as long as Western money keeps on flowing, they will have additional time to improve their skills.

As soon as the US leaves Afghanistan will enter another civil war. Afghanistan will be back where it started.

Maybe ... maybe. However, it is also worth noting that Afghanistan didn't collapse or come close to collapsing when the U.S. decreased its troop presence there from about 100,000 to about 10,000 over the last 4 or 5 years. 














 Completely agreed. 




  genderfluid

Gender-fluid: Someone who alternates between genders.

 crossdreaming

Imagining oneself as another gender/sex. 









 Thank you. :) 




 Congratulations to him! :) I am certainly glad that he is now cancer-free! :) 




 Understood; also, though, for the record, I still want to get this done in a safe, medical setting. I am simply preparing for the tragic worst-case scenario just in case. :( 









 However, I can ask this question here again in one or two years, correct? 




 Thanks for this info. :) 









  it has the lowest chance of complications and the fewest risks as long as you are going to a reputable surgeon.

That's the crucial part, though; after all, unfortunately gate-keeping has not allowed all aspiring eunuchs to successfully find such a surgeon. :( 




 In the big picture, Yes. However, I am not talking about 1979 Afghanistan here--rather I'm talking about 2001 Afghanistan here. 




 Eh ... I'd say that Afghanistan is better off now than it was back in 2001. 




  On second thought don't actually do that.

Too late. ;) 




 That's because he was the first U.S. President who was born after the U.S. actually became independent (in 1776). 









 Yes, but wrong in the sense of being too *pessimistic*. 









 Any thoughts on this? 




 Why not? 




  What a fascinating man.

Completely agreed. :) 




 I don't want GRS, though. 




 You already got a part of Kashmir, though. 




 Or only have gay sex while one is in college. ;) 




 What exactly does RIT stand for? 




 What exactly is a Monroebot, though? 




 Then don't have a kid in the first place. Problem solved. 




 You are forgetting the fact that after sufficiently intelligent and sentient artificial intelligence (AI) is developed, even robots would be able to claim that the sex that they had with you was non-consensual. 




 Unless I am missing something, it appears that the left of guilty of hypocrisy in regards to this (and I say this as a liberal-leaning person myself). After all, if the left wants the government and authorities out of people's bedrooms, then why the heck it is supporting a law as drastic as this one?

I certainly think that people who are guilty of sexual assault should be punished, but laws such as this one appear to reduce the importance and meaning of *actual* sexual assault. :( 




 Ah; OK. Got it! :) 




 You're freaked out by vaginas? 




 So 9 out of 10 Chinese people would be willing to support the proposal which I stated here? 














 Other than more warfare, fighting, and deaths, obviously (and unfortunately)? 









 Yep. :) 




 Yes, while I like things such as hijabs. ;) Seriously. 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Yep. :) It's a bit disappointing that none of them became supercentenarians, though. :( 














  Let's be honest China's claim is most likely right.

Do you mean in both the east and in the west?

  Mcmahaon line was drawn up the British.

Yes, but China was already willing to agree to it back under Mao (as in, before the 1962 Sino-Indian War).

 Some of that land if theirs , not all , but some.

So what exactly do you propose should be done in regards to this?

 In reality we lost a lot of land in the west with Sindh and Punjab due to that idiot Gandhi.

Can you please elaborate on this part? 




 I'm sorry ... what? 




  I'd prefer you didn't do it at all;

So do I, actually. 




  China will keep the issue boiling until it reaches a position of maximum strength where it can leverage a deal highly skewed in its favour.

How exactly will such a deal look like, though? Also, will India even accept such a deal? 




  I think that the majority of Palestinians in general would vastly prefer to live in Israel rather than Palestine, Israel has a prosperous economy, low corruption, no occupation, no restrictions on airspace or resource use, no significant conflicts, and a very good political system. However Israel has consistently forbid any Palestinian in the Palestinian territories, as well as the 700,000 Arab Israelis displaced in 1948 from having Israeli citizenship or from having any sort of representation in the Knesset. Now Israel wants to annex and have permanent exclusive Jewish control over Arab East Jerusalem, the universally recognized rightful capital of Palestine, without taking any of the Palestinians elsewhere else in the occupied territories. This is completely unacceptable. You can't just take the capital of a state which you find valuable, and leave the rest to languish. You either have to let the Palestinians have a real viable state (give them east jerusalem) or you have to annex the whole of Palestine. A partial measure is unacceptable.

OK.

I don't know enough about it to say my opinion about that.

OK.

It will be Israeli.

So Syria (if it will even survive its current civil war intact) will never get the Golan Heights back?

Exactly the same as Obama and Bush. She will vocally condemn the expansion of settlements, she will call for east jerusalem to be the capital of Palestine, but she will do nothing practical other than support Israel with aid and weapons, and defend it from UNSC resolutions at the UN.

What about if a new Israeli leader wants to make peace with the Palestinians, though? Will she agree to mediate between the two of them?

She will be more hawkish on Iran than Obama, if Obama has not locked in a very comprehensive deal by the time he leaves office.

If so, then one should be happy that Obama will probably have such a deal locked in by the point that he will leave office.

Clinton is very eager to display her hawkish side, she has made that exceedingly clear.

This might be in order to silence sexist critics who challenge her toughness due to the fact that she is a woman, though.

Also, one more thing: If terrorist groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad refuse to fully and veritable disarm in the event of a final Israeli-Palestinian peace deal (even if/as they agree to recognize Israel), then who exactly is going to forcibly disarm these terrorist groups? Israel? 




 Any thoughts on this? 
























 Wouldn't that have been successfully dealt with if Obama was Hillary's VP for the last eight years, though? 




  yea he was. The reason he went along with Oslo is because Oslo was actually engineered while Bush Sr. was in office.

Yeah, I don't really have as much of a problem with Oslo (which, for the record, I think was necessary) as I do with the lack of response to terrorism that came with it and with the increased expectations for peace which in turn might have helped result in the Second Intifada breaking out after the collapse of the Camp David peace talks in 2000.

Bush I was the first president to begin talks with the PLO. Plus, Oslo was popular in Israel back in the early '90s.

Yes; all of this appears to be correct.

 If you read "Putting People First," which was the Clinton/Gore campaign book, they were actually against a Palestinian state before they came to office.

Understood; for the record, I don't have a problem with a Palestinian state--in fact, I support such a state because it's better than having Israel rule millions of Palestinians. Rather, I have a problem with the way that the Oslo process was handled.

 Also, Clinton treated Netanyahu better than Bush Sr. treated Shamir, or Obama treats Netanyahu, even tho Bibi and Bill weren't as close at Rabin and Bill.

That might be debatable; after all, Obama's actions, as opposed to his words, aren't anti-Israel or even anti-Netanyahu. Indeed, I think that pro-Israel advocates have been too harsh on Obama.

Also, in regards to Netanyahu, didn't Clinton actually send some of his campaign advisers in order to help Ehud Barak's campaign against Netanyahu in 1999? If so, then that's more anti-Netanyahu than anything that Obama has done.

Of course, as a side note, I do think that Netanyahu's stalling in regards to the peace process was more acceptable in the 1990s than it is today. After all, unlike Yasser Arafat, Mahmoud Abbas actually *did* deliver on his promises to stop terrorism (Yes, there is Hamas in Gaza, but Abbas can't do anything about them for obvious logistical reasons). 




  For all we know Obama would have flamed out during this 8 year period.

Why exactly do you think that, though? 














  She'd be centrist because she is already fighting history trying to get a 3rd consecutive term for her party.

OK.

Between 1952 and now, 1988 is the only election when that's happened. While in 2000, Al Gore kind of did the same in that he, like Bush Sr. in 1988, got the largest share of the vote, he 1. didn't make it to the White House, and 2, like Bush in 1988, had a smaller margin of victory (winner minus loser) than his predecessor had the cycle before.

Yes, though it is worth noting that we came close to having the same party win the U.S. Presidency 3+ times in a row in 1960, 1968, 1976, and 2000.

 One of the other reasons she'll be a centrist is because Obama's faced a lot of problems in Congress because his perceived liberalism caused regional issues. Hillary is going to want less north-south division.

Yes, but is she going to be successful in this regard? After all, isn't she already extremely polarizing?

 She also doesn't want to suffer the fate of Bush Sr., who got pushed to the far right on social conservatism by Buchanan, Quayle, and the family values crowd. Hell, in the summer of 1992 (when Perot had left the race), and Bush was still getting owned by Clinton, people wanted him to swap Quayle ("Murphy Brown as a professional woman hurts kids") with Pete Wilson from California. Buchanan's speech at the RNC played a role in the fact they never came close to covering their polling deficit until Perot re-entered and took away change vote.

The thing is, though, that having Hillary be centrist might cause less liberals to go out and vote for her; frankly, I am unsure that she would be able to get enough centrist voters to make up for this vote deficit.

 There's a tendency of voters to move against the party/ideology thats been in power for a long time. Anyone notice how badly Ike beat Stevenson? While Ike was no conservative, he was a move away from what was liberalism back in 1952 and 1956.

Yes, but the Democrats won the White House for *five* consecutive terms between 1932 and 1948 and also had to deal with Korea and corruption in 1952. Thus, 1952 probably isn't a good comparison to either 2016 or 2020. 




 Because they strongly like Western culture? ;) 




  Also I'm not racist.

Sure you aren't. ;) 




 If so, though, then why exactly aren't sailors that smart? 




 What about the seals, though? 




 I agree with you about the latter but I am uncertain about the former. After all, her husband wasn't exactly that pro-Israel back when he was U.S. President. 




  where as the town where I grew up you can probably rent a full house for 1000-1200/month so they can have a much lower minimum wage.

Where exactly did you grow up, though?

  What do you believe would cause Iran to drop its support of Shia proxies in the region?

Regime change in Iran might accomplish this task.

However, don't some of Iran's proxies, such as the Houthis in Yemen, actually have legitimate grievances? 




 The scene about Biggus Dickus from Monty Python's Life of Brian:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K8_jgiNqUc 




 OK; if so, then I apologize for asking this.

Also, out of curiosity, how exactly do you think that a Hillary Clinton Presidency (starting from 2017) would be different from Barack Obama's Presidency (in the 2009 to 2017 time period)? 




 Would this be good enough for you? :

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/hillarys-war-how-conviction-replaced-skepticism-in-libya-intervention/2011/10/28/gIQAhGS7WM_story.html

"During the initial weeks of unrest in Libya, Clinton was among the White House officials clinging to fading hopes that Gaddafi might fall without any help from the West.

From the first armed resistance on Feb. 18 until March 9, the disorganized opposition movement appeared to be on a roll, taking control of Libyan cities from Benghazi to Brega and Misurata on the Mediterranean coast. But in a single, bloody week, Gaddafi loyalists turned rebel gains into a rout, crushing resistance in towns across Libya before marshaling forces for a final drive against Benghazi, the last opposition stronghold." 




 Please let me try finding some and then get back to you on this. :) 









 Understood.

Also, out of curiosity, exactly which U.S. state are you from? 




 As far as I know, though, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met Mahmoud Jibril (one of the Libyan rebel political leaders) for the first time in mid-March 2011. Before that meeting with Jibril, I think that Hillary Clinton opposed U.S. military intervention in Libya. Rather, it was only after that meeting that Hillary changed her mind in regards to this and helped convince Obama to militarily intervene in Libya. 




 So you ended up changing your mind and voting for Obama? Or did you vote for Clinton and then change your mind and began supporting Obama?

Also, why exactly do you think that a Clinton Presidency (starting from 2017) will be "centrist"? After all, if anything, I think that Clinton will want to continue Obama's legacy. 









 Yeah, I also think that, short of perhaps a partition of South Tyrol, the status quo is probably the best option for South Tyrol. After all, South Tyrol already has many ethnic Italians living there, especially in large cities such as Bolzano. 




 Why the heck would have Obama told Gaddafi to step down if he thought that Gaddafi was winning, though? After all, it would be utterly idiotic to damage one's relations with Gaddafi if one thinks that Gaddafi is going to defeat the Libyan rebels. 









 Gaddafi, not Assad. :)

Anyway, though, apparently the West felt so confident in the Libyan rebels winning that Obama said in late February 2011 that Gaddafi must resign. Do you want me to give you proof of this statement of Obama's? 



















 Because, based on my memories of this, the Libyan rebels were initially successful in February 2011 before Gaddafi's forces began to turn the tide in early March 2011 (or somewhere around there). 




 Well, at least I still have 21 years to buy some popcorn for this occasion. :) 




 For me, at least, it would be this:

http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/events/other/10/index.shtml

"On 29 July, the Population Division will release the twenty-fourth round of official United Nations population estimates and projections."

Yes, I absolutely love demographics. :) 




 As for me, I was too young to vote in 2008, but I supported Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries that year. While Obama has some flaws, I do not regret my support of him in the 2008 Democratic primaries; after all, in my honest opinion, we needed a break from 20 (or 28, if one includes Bush Sr.'s Vice Presidency) continuous years of Bush-Clinton rule. :) Thanks to Obama defeating Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primaries, we indeed got such a break. :)

Anyway, any thoughts on this? 




 What exactly is this, though? 




 An extremely hot rock or something along those lines. :( 




 Oh; OK.

Anyway, I think that Bush could have gotten the U.S. Congress to approve of another war if Iraq would have been a quick success. However, I suspect that a part of the reason that Bush invaded Iraq was because he had a personal grudge against Saddam for trying to kill his dad; thus, Bush might not be sufficiently motivated to invade any other countries even if Iraq ended up being a quick success. After all, simply posturing and making himself appear to be a fighter against "evildoers," as well as pointing to his successes in Afghanistan and Iraq, might have been enough for Bush to win re-election in this TL in 2004. 




 I am sorry, but what exactly does WOT stand for? 




 I am curious to hear the personal opinions of South Tyrolese people in regards to this. 




 Also, in regards to Bush, did his administration actually have such a plan? Or was it mere rhetoric on their part (possibly in order to help helping Bush's 2004 re-election campaign)? 




  I'm unaware of any attempted annexations on his par

Well, there does appear to be this annexation attempt on Gaddafi's part:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadian%E2%80%93Libyan_conflict

"Gaddafi initially intended to annex the Aouzou Strip, the northernmost part of Chad, which he claimed as part of Libya on the grounds of an unratified treaty of the colonial period.[4]" 




 The thing is, though, that I am unsure that Bush would have had a "window of opportunity" to do this before the Arab Spring; after all, as far as I know (AFAIK), the Iraqi insurgency was already gaining steam by December 2003 (which is when Gaddafi actually made the final decision to give up his nuclear weapons program and his WMDs). 




 Thanks for this info. :)

Thus, if France would have turned against Saddam in 2002-2003, do you think that this would have been enough for Saddam to act quickly enough to save his own skin? Or do you think that Saddam would have still gotten overthrown in this scenario? 




 In order to secure Libya's WMDs and nukes?

Also, by sooner, do you mean sooner in 2011, or even before the Arab Spring broke out (and if so, then when exactly)? 




 OK; fair enough, I suppose.

Also, out of curiosity, do you think that NATO would have still militarily intervened against Gaddafi in 2011 if he would have kept his WMDs and his nuclear weapons program in 2003 (and later as well)? 




  Gaddafi on the other hand, as far as I'm aware, didn't have the same desire to be the regional strongman. He wanted to run his country and carry out his own stuff, but wasn't exactly trying to claim himself as a defender of the Arab world (granted he didn't share a border with the eternal enemy like Saddam did). And wasn't as chummy with some of the P5 (since Italy doesn't have a veto) so he would have had more reason to fear the US threats.

Wasn't Gaddafi pretty close with Russia and/or China, though? 




 Frankly, I don't think that Iran will ever give up its sponsorship and support of its Shiite proxies unless it absolutely has to do this. After all, Iran can project its power both through them and by threatening to violate this nuclear deal and to build nuclear weapons. 




 Couldn't Gaddafi have quickly conquered Benghazi and then have quickly rebuilt it with his oil money, though? 




  It's so much more complicated than that... their nuclear program is way down the "what caused Ghaddafi's downfall" list. Internal opposition, sectarian violence, push for reforms, economic instability... there's a long list of bigger factors.

But if Libya would have had missiles which would have been able to carry nuclear weapons or even WMDs in 2011 and which would have been able to hit Britain, France, and/or Italy, then this might have given NATO second thoughts about militarily intervening in favor of the Libyan rebels that year. After all, I don't think that NATO would want to risk having British, French, and/or Italian citizens get killed by Libyan nukes or even by Libyan WMDs. 




  Ghaddafi envisioned an African Union that is not robbed of its resources by others, that solves their problems internally, that has a bigger political impact and is independant from institutions like the world bank, IMF etc. He also believed in socialist ideas and wanted to establish welfare states in other countries much like his own, which was, according to the UN, much more progressive than most East European countries.

OK.

 After the 9/11 attacks Ghaddafi actually wanted to join the war on terror and reached out, he thought he could get international support to get rid of a problem that has been plaguing him ever since, a minority of jihadists in his own country that were constantly interfering with his rule and did not agree with his ideas.

Didn't U.S.-Iran relations also improve during the War on Terror and before Bush's Axis of Evil speech, though?

 Unfortunately he was perceived as a supporter of terrorsim because he was still being hold responsible for the Lockerbie bombing(while it is well known that it was Iran) and other terrorist activities in the 70s and 80s.

OK; that said, though, why exactly do you think that Iran is to blame for the Lockerbie bombing?

 Also the strategy of the US immediately after 9/11 was to invade several North African countries, Lybia among them.

Source, please?

 After invading Afghanistan the US concentrated their effort on Iraq, the country they wanted to invade originally as a consequence of 9/11.

OK.

 At this point Gaddafi saw what the US is willing to do to countries they deem to be supporters of terrorism, that have or are developing WMDs.

OK.

He also understood that without international support his dream of an African Union will never become true. Thats why he approached the international community and offered to dismantle his nuclear program

OK.

that never really gained traction and was pretty much doomed to fail.

Source, please? After all, the impression that I have is that Libya's nuclear program was actually very technically advanced due to the help of the A. Q. Khan network and that Libya's primary weakness as a lack of domestic nuclear expertise.

 He did and subsequently became an ally of the west.

Yes; correct!

 Iran didnt. They never feared a US invasion due to its sheer size and military power. Iran has always been what the US turned Saddam into, a state with a working military that has huge arsenals of WMDs and an entire people that are willing to die fighting invaders, especially the US. They were sure no one would come after them, especially after the massive problems emerging in Iraq and Afghanistan. The US couldnt handle even a single warzone, there was no way that they would ever try and attack Iran.

It is worth noting, though, that Iran *did* halt all of its uranium enrichment between 2003 and 2005; rather, unlike Libya, Iran never gave up its *entire* nuclear program.

 Another thing this made abundantly clear is that you need a nuclear program and nukes to prevent aggressors like Israel and the US from invading your country. I firmly believe Iran will have nukes at some point in time, it doesnt matter if they established their civilian program first, they will get them and rightfully so.

That wasn't that clear in 2003, though; rather, that only became clear in 2011 with Gaddafi's overthrow.

 Nuclear energy is a giant money sink when only used for civilian purposes. Its extremely expensive, other forms of energy production are far more economical, Iran is rich on natural ressources, the risk of having your civilian nuclear power plants bombed by Israel/US is far too high and the question of what to do/where to store depleted fuel rods has not been answered yet.

 A nuclear program in this day and age has only one goal: The Bomb.

Thanks for this info; that said, though, as far as I know, Iran has stopped actively pursuing an actual nuclear weapon in 2003. Rather, after 2003, Iran has apparently only been interested in having the capacity to build a nuclear weapon.

 Iran needs it, Iran gets it. Assad wanted it too, the Israelis bombed his test reactor. Saddam wanted it, the Israelis bombed it.

Do you think that Israel would have been able to likewise effectively bomb Libya if Gaddafi would have insisted on keeping his nuclear weapons program, though?

 They cant do that with Iran. Its too powerful. Not only would their Jets not make it there, the backlash would be severe.

What if Saudi Arabia will help Israel bomb Iran, though? Then would Israel be able to successfully do this?

 As far as Ghaddafi goes: Stopping his nuclear program and the efforts to get nuclear bombs and allying with the west was what ultimately lead to his death.

Yes, you might very well be correct in regards to this.

 In the light of the Arab spring the jihadists thought they could overthrow Ghaddafi and gained a lot of international support. The west dropped his ally who, just months before, had eaten at their table and camped outside UN facilities. They later started a bombing campaign to ensure the victory of the jihadists which in return turned Libya into a Sharia state and established a branch of the IS. Would not have happened with a nuclear armed Libya.

Largely agreed, though I don't think that most of the Libyan rebels are as bad as you make them out to be. 




  I would have to research it, but I remember they did this shortly after US/UK invasion of Iraq as if to say, "Shit, I didn't know you guys were that serious about these things!"

Yes, I think that the Iraq War was a factor in Libya's 2003 disarmament. However, please keep in mind that Iran also temporarily stopped enriching uranium between 2003 and 2005 (perhaps also due to a fear of the U.S.). However, unlike Libya, Iran never gave up its entire nuclear program.

And they dismantled and verified to us, not to the UN, if I remember correctly.

I think that Libya did this because Gaddafi still wanted to keep all of his options open between March 2003 and December 2003; in other words, during this time, while he seriously considered pursuing a rapprochement with the West, he also wanted to have the opportunity to change his mind in regards to this. It was only in December 2003 when Gaddafi made the final decision to give up his nuclear weapons program and his WMDs. In contrast, if Gaddafi would have come to the U.N. rather than only to the U.S. and Britain, then he might not have had the opportunity to change his mind in regards to this later on. Indeed, I seem to recall that the 2003 negotiations between Libya, the U.S., and Britain were kept secret until December 2003, when Gaddafi made the final decision to give up his nuclear weapons program and his WMDs.

 Why didn't Iran? If I had to guess, I'd say Iran was more confident than Libya.

So Iran was less concerned about U.S. military action against it in 2003 than Libya was during this time?

Maybe Libya wanted something from the West and thought it could buy a favor or two with this concession.

Yes, but didn't Iran also want better ties with the West during this time? After all, Iran *did* halt all of its uranium enrichment between 2003 and 2005 (during this time, Iran was negotiating with Britain, France, and Germany over its nuclear program); however, unlike Libya, Iran never gave up its *entire* nuclear program. 




 But if Libya would have had missiles which would have been able to carry nuclear weapons or even WMDs in 2011 and which would have been able to hit Britain, France, and/or Italy, then this might have given NATO second thoughts about militarily intervening in favor of the Libyan rebels that year. After all, I don't think that NATO would want to risk having British, French, and/or Italian citizens get killed by Libyan nukes or even by Libyan WMDs. 




 Yes, but please keep in mind that, as far as I know, even with this nuclear deal, Iran would still retain the capacity to build a nuclear weapon. Thus, if things will ever get desperate for the Iranian Ayatollahs, they would simply be able to violate this deal and to quickly race to build nuclear weapons.

In contrast, as far as I know, Gaddafi gave up his entire nuclear weapons program in 2003. Thus, he had no opportunity to quickly race to build a nuclear weapon when things got very desperate for him in 2011. 




 As far as I know, though, Libya didn't have sanctions on it in 2011; however, this certainly didn't prevent a large part of the Libyan population from rebelling against Gaddafi that year.

Plus, I think that Iran was under much less sanctions in 2009, which in when it experienced large-scale demonstrations against the disputed re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. 




 Yes, but please keep in mind that, as far as I know, even with this nuclear deal, Iran would still retain the capacity to build a nuclear weapon. Thus, if things will ever get desperate for the Iranian Ayatollahs, they would simply be able to violate this deal and to quickly race to build nuclear weapons.

In contrast, as far as I know, Gaddafi gave up his entire nuclear weapons program in 2003. Thus, he had no opportunity to quickly race to build a nuclear weapon when things got very desperate for him in 2011.
 




 Yes, this might be partially correct; however, I also got the impression that Europe and the U.S. miscalculated by initially calling for Gaddafi to resign when it looked like the rebels would win the Libyan civil war without any help. Then, when the tide began to turn in Gaddafi's favor and (I think) Gaddafi threatened to stop selling oil to the West, the West realized that it miscalculated and decided to help the Libyan rebels by implementing a no-fly zone in Libya and by pursuing a bombing campaign in Libya against Gaddafi's forces. 




 That was only after a civil war broke out in Libya, after Britain and France lobbied for U.S. military intervention, and after (I think) Gaddafi threatened to stop selling oil to the West due to the West previously calling on him (Gaddafi) to resign, though. 




 Again, that 2003 "Iran-U.S. grand bargain" claim here appears to be a half-truth:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/12/09/kerrys-claim-that-iran-offered-bush-a-nuclear-deal-in-2003/

However, I do agree with you that the Bush blew it by including Iran in the Axis of Evil in 2002. With that speech of his, I think that Bush was trying to increase or at least keep his own popularity at home by portraying himself as a fighter against "evildoers" in the style of FDR and World War II; while this speech (as well as John Bolton's "Beyond the Axis of Evil" speech several months later) might have worked (after all, Bush did win re-election in 2004), it also hurt U.S.-Iranian relations for the next decade. 




 Actually, your 2003 "Iran-U.S. grand bargain" claim here appears to be a half-truth:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/12/09/kerrys-claim-that-iran-offered-bush-a-nuclear-deal-in-2003/ 




 Please keep in mind, though, that just like Libya, Iran was also at a perceived risk of enduring U.S. military action in 2003. However, unlike Libya (which gave up its entire nuclear weapons program, as well its WMD stockpiles, to the West), Iran merely stopped uranium enrichment for 1.5 years between 2003 and 2005 but never offered to give up its entire nuclear program. 




 You might very well be correct in regards to this; after all, the impression that I get is that, even before 2003, Gaddafi had already gotten out of the terrorism business by the mid-1990s (but still refused to pay compensation to the Lockerbie victims until 2003); in contrast, Iran still appears to be in the terrorism business even today due to its support and sponsorship of groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas.

Thus, my point here is that, as you said, Libya might have wanted a genuine rapprochement with the West whereas Iran might simply want a modus vivendi with the West. 




 Fair enough, I suppose. 




 Actually, Libya was also a signer of the NPT even before 2003. 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 I don't think that Israel has threatened either Libya or Iran, though. 









 Any thoughts on this? 



















 Good luck to you, then! :) 














 Completely agreed. :) 




 That's certainly very interesting! As for me, I don't think that I have ever dreamed in black-and-white. 
























 Any thoughts on this? 




 Yep. ;) 




 Caitlyn Jenner, not Bruce Jenner. :) 














 I think that he died a day after the duel; also, I don't think that he died from poor medical practices. 














 Good! :) After all, it's not like the U.S. embargo on Cuba has produced any positive change(s) there. 














 Thanks for this information. 




 In order to save money, no? 




 Is East Jerusalem genuinely the most valuable chunk of Palestine, though? 




 The problem (from the Israeli perspective) with annexing all of the Palestinian territories, though, is that doing this will very likely ensure that Israel will no longer have a Jewish-majority population. 














 Yes, and? 
























 Great news! :) 




 Yeah; hence my point that not everyone could be a Schindler during the Holocaust even if they wanted to. 




 What about implementing democracy in Iran? After all, the Iranian people give me the impression that they are more ready for democracy than, say, the Egyptian people are. 




 Actually, I think that FDR was an economic liberal back in the 1930s. 




  Because Germany doesn't have double jeopardy laws.

Then Germany should fix that as soon as possible.

They also broadly applied a law to mean the military chef, the guy who washed clothes and the toilet cleaners are all "complicit" in war crimes because they are "essential" the camp (the camp too, not essential to the process of war crimes. Just the camp).

He wasn't actually found guilty of any specific crimes at all.

It's a disgusting political move so they can gain brownie points from their electorates and political lobbies for being the ones to punish a Nazi.

Yeah, you might be correct in regards to this. I mean, I hate Nazis, but if this man didn't know about the Holocaust and whatnot when he joined the Waffen SS, then I don't think that he should be held responsible in any way for it. Plus, in any case, putting someone on trial two or more times for the very same crime seems extremely wrong to me. :( 




  Good question. If the answer is yes, then I suppose that would answer your original question.

I am not so sure about that, though. After all, theoretically speaking, it is possible that some East Jerusalem Arabs want to become Israeli citizens but are afraid to do this as long as the Arab-Israeli conflict is unresolved in order to avoid being shunned by their families, relatives, friends, and acquaintances.

I know some had the option of citizenship when Jerusalem was annexed after the 67 war, but most didn't take it, similar to the Golan Druze.

Yes, that is correct; however, I am unsure that one can automatically conclude from this fact that most East Jerusalem Arabs prefer Palestinian rule over Israeli rule. 




 Wait--he's already been acquitted of these same war crimes? If so, then shouldn't it be illegal to put someone on trial two or more times for the same crime(s)? 




 Out of curiosity, exactly which failed revolution attempts throughout history came the closest to succeeding?

Any thoughts on this? 




 I've got a question--would this fetal tissue only be the property of the women who get abortions? Or would the fathers of these dead fetuses also have a clean to this fetal issue? Completely serious question, for the record. 









 Yes, I am aware that the overwhelming majority of Israeli Arabs are Israeli citizens whereas the overwhelming majority of Palestinian Arabs are not Israeli citizens.

That said, though, can't any East Jerusalem Arab (or at least any East Jerusalem Arab without, say, a criminal record) apply for and receive Israeli citizenship? Serious question, for the record. 




 Also, out of curiosity, if you had to permanently pick right now, would you yourself choose to be an Israeli citizen and to live in Israel or to live in a Palestinian state (assuming that such a state was magically created right now)? 




 Wasn't Ronald Reagan previously a Democrat, though? If so, then people changing their minds and views over time really shouldn't be viewed as being that surprising. 




 Thanks for sharing this info. :) 




 Thanks for clarifying this part.

That said, though, would acquiring Israeli citizenship make life easier for you or not? I am simply curious about this. 




  It would be a powerful lesson, unlike no other. Skinheads might take heed.

Yep. :) However, I don't think that he will be able to give any such lessons while he will be in jail. :( 




 Doesn't Israel also provide you with welfare whenever you need it, though? 




  Sure, that's a legitimate argument to make and should be weighed into factor when answering your question.

Agreed. :)

But everything I said also makes sense too right?

Yes, it does. :)

Either way I'm sure you'll find lots of Arabs who prefer Israeli rule and I'm sure the converse is true that a lot of Arabs don't want to live under Israeli rule, but do so out of basic necessity.

Agreed.

I guess you can say these Arabs have to make a choice between living in good personal economic conditions (filled with discrimination at every level) vs. having freedom but likely way worse economic conditions and poorer social capital.

Agreed.

Basically, I think it boils down to quality of life vs. relative freedom (fair treatment). Different people have different preferences. I personally would choose the freedom route but I can't speak for all Arabs living in Israel.

Agreed; however, it is also worth noting that if Israeli Arabs actually wanted to live in a Palestinian state, then Israel would probably be willing to transfer at least some of its Arab-majority areas to a future Palestinian state in the event of a final Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty. After all, Israel probably wants to become even more Jewish, and what better way to do that than by transferring some Arab-majority areas of Israel to a new Palestinian state? However, I think that many Israeli Arabs themselves protest whenever anyone suggests such a proposal, which in turn might explain why exactly the idea of transferring Arab-majority areas of Israel to a future Palestinian state hasn't been discussed much, if at all, in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. 




  Iran will have the same problem to contend with. and without the oil,

Doesn't Iran have a more talented population than Saudi Arabia has, though? Serious question, for the record.

 and without the oil, why does the US even really care about the Middle East?

Due to Israel, the threat of radical Islam, and the Middle East's strategic location.

 The one exception is Israel, and Saudi Arabia is much closer to the US position on Israel than Iran. Now, if Iran's government were (by revolution or otherwise) willing to forgo arming terrorist groups such as Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Hizballah, then I think we would run into the scenario you are describing, and relations between the US and Iran could develop pretty fruitfully at that point.

Frankly, I think that a final Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty is more likely than not to occur by the end of the 2020s (in other words, sometime within the next 15 years). 




 Maybe the Germans are trying to compensate for being too soft in regards to their treatment of ex-Nazis in the first couple of decades after the end of World War II? 




 Didn't Schindler have a lot of money which he could use in his quest to save Jews, though? If so, then it is worth noting that not everyone has the kind of money or the same opportunities that Schindler had. 




 Yep--safe from an imaginary threat. 




 What about if he's still alive in four years' time, though? ;) 




 That statement might be overly general, though. 




 I fucking hate Nazis, but if he didn't know about the SS's atrocities when he joined the SS, then I am unsure that he should be punished for this given his lack of options in regards to this. 




 Yeah--the word "Nazi" sends shivers down my spine whenever I hear it. :( 




 For what it's worth, if the court was going to find Groening guilty (as it did), then a better punishment for him would have probably been for him to be required to teach young Germans about the evils of Nazism. After all, four years in prison might not mean very much for someone of his age (assuming that he will still be alive in four years, that is). 




  Dunno how accurate that one is lol

*Cough, cough* Rob Ford. ;) 




 Canada--our goody, two shoes, little brother! ;) 




 Does this ban apply to cartoon child porn as well or only to actual child porn, though? 




 Before I watched it, I would have probably said either Last Exile or its sequel. :) Seriously. :) 




 What about if Hillary Clinton will win in 2016? 









 Jesus had two daddies; just saying. ;) 




 Wow--this is probably the first time in a long while, if ever, that Angela Merkel said something that I disagree with. :( 




 Look--I am certainly keeping an open mind in regards to this. However, I do think that you forgot one crucial distinction between Israel and Palestine--Israel, in contrast to (the future state of) Palestine, is a wealthy, developed country. Thus, even with all of the discrimination that Israeli Arabs (as in, outside of East Jerusalem) endure, only a minority of them actually wants to live in a Palestinian state or in another Arab country (as opposed to living in Israel). 




 Horny cop alert. ;) 









 Thanks for sharing all of this info. :) 




 With the extremely recent signing of the Iran nuclear deal, what exactly do you think the future of U.S.-Iran relations will be? 

For the record, my own thoughts on this is that U.S.-Iran relations will continue to be pretty cold under the current Iranian Supreme Leader (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) but possibly become warmer under a future Iranian Supreme Leader (after Khamenei's death). Indeed, I expect a U.S. embassy to open in Tehran in either the 2020s or in the 2030s. 
  
In addition to this, though, Iran and the U.S. will obviously continue cooperating against ISIS, et cetera; after all, both Iran and the U.S. have mutual interests in regards to this. However, even after U.S.-Iran ties will become fully normalized (probably sometime in either the 2020s or in the 2030s, depending on when exactly Khamenei dies and on who exactly succeeds him as Iran's Supreme Leader), I expect the Iranian regime to continue its hostile, anti-American rhetoric at least to some degree due to the fact that, as far as I know, the legitimacy of the Iranian regime appears to depend on such rhetoric from Iran's political leaders and from Iran's military. 

Also, though, once the oil in Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia will begin running out, the U.S. could move even closer to Iran, especially if the Iranian regime will get overthrown by that point in time. After all, as far as I know, the Iranian people are, on average, more pro-American than many Arabs are, and frankly, this could very well remain the case a couple of decades from now or even several decades from now. 

Anyway, any thoughts on this? 




 Are you yourself a federal employee or a bank employee, though? 




  At their best, which area seems to function better overall in terms of public and emergency services, utilities and shopping and various other aspects of daily life, occupied territory or Palestinian run territory. And if there's a difference does this hold true in Palestinian territory that neighbors occupied areas?

OK, but what exactly would the answer to this question of yours be? 




 Why exactly would we get an extra day off if Jimmy Carter would pass away, though?

 I have previously read that more of them prefer Israeli rule over Palestinian rule, but I am unsure as to exactly how accurate this data is.
