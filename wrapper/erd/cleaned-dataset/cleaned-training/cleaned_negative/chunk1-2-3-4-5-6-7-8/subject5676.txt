 Almost everything by Simon Armitage is great. His poems capture an enjoyable blend of darkness and humor. 
I quite like this one:

 I think it's best to stick to an idea of a thyme scheme aabbcc can work but often it just sounds busy, maybe try other rhyme schemes but never feel like you have to be confined to it, especially in spoken word. With meter, it can be just a matter of going over it.
Good luck. 




 Happy Birthday, 1951 by Vonnegut is an amazing short story, made me feel many emotions. 


































 Thanks this, it's very helpful. I do often worry my characters fears are too similar to my own. Think this concept should help me add more range. 
 




 Yossarian and the Chaplain from Catch-22, always wondered about how the rest of their lives would go. Then I found out about Closing Time. Both wonderful novels.  




 We may go to the same Uni, I saw him read at my Uni last year too. Though I imagine he does many readings. 




 I love this poem, it's one of only a few poems I know by heart.didn't mean to memorise it but it's always stayed with me. 
























 When I finished Brave New World, I had to stop reading for a month. I was 16 at the time and it was the most impressed and ethically challenged that I had felt with any book. Trying to read other books after that experience was a little unfair so I just had to stop for a while. 




 "One bird said to Billy Pilgrim, 'Poo-tee-weet?'" 




 This has made my day. 




 I wish "Bad Motherfucker" was written on his lightsaber.
 




 The library near where I live received a donation of about 10 dark horse star wars omnibuses, when I was in high school. I still get them out and read them a couple of times a year. 
 
























 I love reading! It has always played a massive part in my life. I've been writing a lot since around the age of 15. I am now 18 and I'm editing my first novel.  A good friend of mine is editing helping me and she is overwhelmingly positive. though when I read my work, I find it hard to not compare it to the books that I love, which are always significantly better. I"m wondering if others feel this way about there writing? And if so, how do you approach these feelings? 
 




 I would say don't give up on the idea of survivors if that is what you want, it may seem that there is no way but perhaps there is  a way which will think up while you're in the shower one day. Its always ok to rewrite the ending. Also I think a less depressing kill everyone off would be something whereby everyone devoted their resources to the survival of a specific individual or everyone collectively just sits down in one another's arms and accepts their fate.  




 Thank you for your honesty. I Think this is a really great example of how a work of fiction can provoke some major change within people and their perceptions of the world.  




 My Grandfather loved Nevil Shute! I believe they exchanged letters for a small period of time in the late 50s. My grandfather was an engineer as well and would not read any other fiction. 




 For me personally it would be the novels of Aldous Huxley, Disgrace by J.M. Coetzee, and Chuck Palahniuk's Lullaby. All of these have changed the way I see the world and I find it strange, that I once had not been influenced by them. 
























 I read it a few years ago. I was just completely blown away by it. The writing style is amazing especially the focalisation on the main character. I loved how the novel captures the grey area of morality in modern society.  




 My high school philosophy teacher gave me the myth of Sisyphus at a dark time in my life. It was a very interesting book. Since then I've read a few others including the stranger. I would recommend reading the collection of Camus's notebooks.  




 I think 14 is a good age to read that book. Its around those years which you begin to consider the depths of morality. I found the book enthralling and I still enjoy it. Though I read The Great Gatsby  at 18, and all though I found it to be well written, the themes and messages were things I had already considered through other media. Of course this shows the impact of the novel on society, I'm just saying that some of those novels written in a different time or place are more significant at younger ages.  




 Thank you for the time you invested in writing this post. I appreciate the advice very much. 
I agree with you wholeheartedly! Especially concerning skepticism when it comes to the kindness of friends opinions. I do want to one day be a great writer. I think I just have to learn to stay on the self assessment side, because being a defeatist will get me nowhere.  




 I have, it's quite heavy, but it certainly opened my eyes to a side of philosophy that i had not previously considered.  
























 Fuck I want that! Well I guess robina is only an hour away from me. And it's only 2 weeks pay.  









 I would watch porn narrated by the voice from halo multiplayer. 









 I wonder if this will lead to any confusing fetishes? Glass, blood, embarrassment, mom...

 I bought it for a friend when they had the flu. She read it in a day and it became her favorite book. I've read all his books and enjoyed them all. This one is great and the book thief is great as well.  




 I thought so too. Got down voted pretty quick. Its from Star Wars Tales 19. 




 "Of all that was found. And all that was lost." -John Connoly. The Book Of Lost Things. 

It was the last book my father read. I read it a year after he died. I was 12 and so was the protagonist, both of us grieving a lost parent.  




 [I Am The Messenger] (http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19057.I_Am_the_Messenger)
The character is a bit older, but its a very good book. The book is mostly about the development of a young man whose life at the beginning of the novel is rather stagnant and unfulfilling.  
























 It worth mentioning that the poem is meant as a parody of shows like Opera and how self harm is considered a taboo topic.  




 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Was an interesting book, very well written and wonderful world building. The ending made me pretty sad.  




 Stephan Dedalus from A portrait Of The Artist. May seem a masturbatory answer (oddly fitting due to the nature of the book). Just because I grew up very religious and very conflicted about my thoughts, feelings and desires. Not understanding the world. The joy and terror of being a bad person in your own eyes. Rejecting your previous beliefs once you become an adult. Deciding to pursue writing. 




 I like the concept and it's quite well written. I really enjoy the final line. I think it might be more effective if you placed the platitudes in bold. Or I guess you could just preface the preface the piece with an explanation. I think the piece could be more humorous and effective in other, less form heavy writing styles. Overall I think you did well! 




 [I Say I Say I Say] (http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/i-say-i-say-i-say/) by Simon Armitage. Just allowed me to laugh at my own self destructive past and recognise that its an oddly common thing.
