 Ironically, Mark is the one who invested in Rapid Ramen. I think it was more about the entrepreneur's drive/determination. He seems to look out for the hard workers, since he was in the same situation (i.e. trying to get his companies off the ground). 




 I think 19 Entertainment basically "owns" anyone who appears on the show. Even if a contestant signs with another label, 19E has the right to "manage" and get a cut out of profits.

 What are your favorite quotes from the show?

I particularly liked "What, do you want to sing Kumbaya? This is business...get to it!" from the 10/4 episode. 




 Is it greedy for Fox to take a cut of American Idol record sales they helped generate? I don't think so. These shows make people famous/millionaires overnight. Not too much to ask  to take some profits back to pay bills.

I understand Cuban's point, though. Some entrepreneurs might not be in a position to give up additional equity, and the sharing clause deters them from being on the show. 




 Coming in unprepared. 




 Daymond is worse, in my opinion. He rarely invests and frequently talks down to entrepreneurs as if he's the king of everything. 




 More like 2.5 hours, according to Cuban. 




 Not necessarily. Viewers may like/buy the product, regardless of what the sharks say. 




 2% profit or 5% equity. Either way, being on the show increases sales sometimes 10-fold, so might be worth it.

 My vote - John Tarr, can't go wrong with him 




 Valid concern. Wendy's Spicy Chili can really impact performance after 3-4 bowls 




 Might want to try a hedging strategy to offset potential losses 




 I agree. What's being asked is superfluous

 "I'll give you half the money you need for twice the equity you're offering" 




 Yes, I think he would be the least likely of all the sharks to donate money to charity. He's greedy with a capital "G". 









 If you can't build a prototype yourself, you'll need to use a site like Freelancer.com and have someone build it based on detailed specs. BUT, before talking to anyone, have them sign an NDA (non-disclosure agreement).  




 Sending a letter to yourself was basically useless even before the patent rules changed. You can send an empty unsealed envelope to yourself before you have an idea, and then add a letter and seal it later. Will not hold up in a court of law. 




 What type of business, if you don't mind me asking? 




 Unorganized with finances or everything in general? 









 Or buy one from eBay/Craigslist for $10. 




 "It's a one-year membership in the jelly of the month club.'

"Clark, that's the gift that keeps on giving the whole year" 




 Funny how Amazon released this "news" that isn't supposed to take place for at least 5 years on the day before Cyber Monday. Coincidence? I think not.

 What about TV shows with intricate plots that require critical thinking? And what about the health aspect....still sitting in the same place while reading/knitting. 




 I can't say...

 I'd have to agree. Disagree with scientific research that says "all TV is bad." 




 Checking Reddit Front Page 




 TV gets the blame for people being overweight/using less brain power, but if you're sitting for the same amount of time doing something else, aren't they the same?

 Still, he seems to think his time is more valuable than any other Shark, and ironically, he probably has the least net worth.

 OK, yo! 




 Posted a pic of myself when I was maybe 6 years old on another site. Someone commented and said, "looks like you're about to be on a Life Cereal commercial". So, me being a geek decided to Photoshop the pic on a Life Cereal box and post as a reply (which I did). Happy now? 




 Question blocks are horrible 




 Could be because they were fortified with 9 essential vitamins and minerals. 




 Well, only one box is in the image. 




 Sounds stupid, but here it goes. I was searching for a Life Cereal box image so I could Photoshop an old pic of myself on the box (the reason for doing this is a different story). As I was searching, I came across a Batman cereal box, and it instantly brought back memories. From there, I searched for other vintage cereal boxes and came across the Nintendo box, which is my favorite. Mmmkay?
