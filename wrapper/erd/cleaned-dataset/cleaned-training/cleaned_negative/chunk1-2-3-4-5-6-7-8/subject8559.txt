 Yep. Something that allows you to see the past, present and projected "flow". This will enable more efficient planning rather than having to destroy and rebuild.

 This is what happens when there is lack of competition. Less ideas across the table, less financial risk and "more of what you love".

 Could you imagine looking at people and seeing them as 2d representations in a 3d space? Think paper mario/dukenukem 3d. Holy shitballs weird. 




 I enjoyed bc1 more than bc2. But nostalgia does that. Vehicles like the golf buggy were obviously map specific and you had the tanks and light vehicles. The maps had a more "designed for multiplayer" feel about them and not as natural/realistically structured as in bc2. 




 Until they ruin bc3, I still have hope. 




 There was levity. Troops would joke with each other and you could cut sick in a golf buggy [bc1] or a quad [bc2]. It wasn't "This a super cereal mission. Look at this palette of blue, black and grey-foreboding isn't it?"

BC tried to be just a game and not a war simulator 




 I read that in H. Jon Benjamin's voice 




 Battlefront was pretty cool too. The thing I enjoyed about the BC series is that it didn't take itself too seriously.
