 interesting  




 I don't hide it

I can't 




 Straight bio at one point, a film about his capture at another

Confused  









 yep 




 cool, any others? 




 wut 




 It's bad.  




 ta 




 Confusing  




 he's not wrong  




 Blow Out

Well. watched it about 2 months ago, me, g 2 friends

across the board hated the film

 




 I'd need an explanation for many of these but interesting none the less  




 -2 for answering politely and with thought

this fucking sub - childish fanboys everywhere, fucking pathetic 

and they don't even fucking know they are as well which is the truly disturbing thing  




 what a dumb

only reason to watch brazil  




 pathetic

 




 I am still confused.  




 What part exactly ?  




 Watching Interstellar gave me pregnant.  









 land of the free

 




 ah sure 




 spent a month in santiago, stunning city the old city is just amazing, lovely people, really nice compared to other parts of spain, yeah food awesome

next place I want to visit in spain is Galicia again

funny the sea inside is on tv tonight here, amazing film 




 I lived in carabanchel (not the prison) and there was two bars near us. One was jammed, chepa, the other had a drunk owner, his wife, much smaller considering the apartments around

Jesus the food

one day cause I was the drunken irish regular TEFL teacher guy they gave me deer stew for free

ridiculous 

I know the wages are shit (my ex has a chemistry masters and worked a government job for 600 a month - some people dont get that part) but fuck it was great

walking around, in the heat, looking at stuff, have a beer somewhere, bottles of tequilla in the chino for 5 or 6 quid. crazy 

spanish deli opened near me, the guy who runs it lived two metro stops down from me too, world is small
 




 yeah, it's a weird one, a sag necessary release that was never going ot be in the cinema Vs. a film that has somewhat of a release worldwide

interesting stuff canuck  




 You could seriously just eat in the pub there, so good, sound slike you have a great life

sigh
  




 friend over there now doing camino

just texted me

9 quid, starter, main, bottle wine, bit of dessert

fuck me

wasn't that cheap in madrid 

 




 yeah I am thinking it is because HR is saying 10-15 screens? 




 I didn't I was just showing the actual record.

The HR report seemed to have a minimum of 10-15 screens as a necessary condition.

Either way I was just putting more info in. Silly me.

   I'll stop: a group of young white 20-somethings sitting around taking drugs talking about how they're going to film themselves robbing a bank.

Well fuck... 4 years working on *Crack The Blog Bank* down the drain. 




 Rewatching Barton has dulled my view of it.

And writing things about writers who have problems writing is often better suited to the movies 




 Yeah you tell em! 




 Cough newspapers cough.

The funny thing is when you see some technowarrior on here laugh at newspapers closing I just shake my head.

I admire wikileaks but it is not going to be able to do what the time or the guardian does.

You complain about tv news being shit - go out and vote with your wallet. Subscribe to X Y and Z. Get an international, one more local, one magazine with commentary. Digital or paper. 

Money where mouth is.

These stations have sponsors, loads of money, they pander to the dumb masses.

You want good journalism, pick up a paper.

Otherwise - and this goes to 99% of users on reddit who complain about this - just shut up.


 









 Most people have heard of great white, hammerhead and tiger sharks but there are many other species - and every year a number of new ones are discovered. One enthusiast has, so far, identified 24 types of shark and related fish that were previously unknown.

 As bad as some shows are and as critical as I am known to be there is a lot going for the show

But... yeah... it's too slow

Horrible to say but a truth isn't it

Not for me (penny dreadful anyone?) it's too slow for the average viewer

And I have to agree. Should have loaded the show, 5 series formula, moved far quicker

Indulgent, good but indulgent

Why cancel? Is there producer deals in place that stops a new showrunner changing it?

Bizarre, considering the background  




 You haven't answered the only question of a source yet.

When you do that, and then we ignore all the evidence of the close relationship between man and dog, we can continue the discussion.

Do not try and twist things with me. 

 




 Yes dog were work animals.

 To early farmers, they were no different from other work animals, such as horses or mules.

Source? 




 Never once mentioned pets. 

 




 they boiled them alive, burn them alive, skin them alive 




 no, work away

 Hyperbole but I understand the point he is trying to make.

 And if he did that today he'd probably be criticized for it, the way the Godzilla director was criticized for not showing Godzilla early enough.

If the 2nd half of that Godzilla film was actually good it wouldn't have mattered. People wanted godzilla because they were bored shitless staring at one of the most blank and charmless actors that hollywood has now decided to add to the roster of young talent.

 A summer blockbuster isn't going for Oscars? What a fucking shock!

Kinda missed the point there mate

 




 Turn around in the context of it being a summer blockbuster etc.

There has been very little of the usual hyperbole regarding it as a film overall.

Seems to have jumped that and went straight to the 'what you expect it's a (insert plot or concept) movie not Ingmar Bergman, get over yourself'

 




  Some of the worst characterization and dialogue I've seen in a blockbuster with decent expectations since The Phantom Menace.

Fuck you might be fucking right
 




 That sounds really high. 




 I'm not really sure if you are slow or just drunk or something.

I was agreeing with you. I said yes, 30,000 years is the number, and that 30,000 years is quite an applicable number to use the term ancient since recorded human history itself only spans about 5,000 years.

Bad troll is bad and can't even play the game properly. Jesus wept.

 Yes, yes it was supposed to make us feel like a dinosaur. 




 Generally positive but with noticeable negatives

 I think the turnaround on this film will be swift even on reddit.

 




 No you used a gif.

  I just think its pretty hilarious given that JW is breaking a lot of money-making records, so I'm sure the studio is SO SAD when you criticize the movie

Shame on some people for wanting to discuss the movie despite its financial success or what the studio thinks, shame.

 Also, you editorialized the headline in this post, which is kind of bad form.

No I didn't, that was a result of the suggest title.


 




 Inoffensive is rather a harsh term in my book. 

Some films = entertainment, sure I get it, but when something is so lifeless and slapped together makes you wonder who is at fault here?

People bitching about the lack of original movies don't go see original movies (fuck sake they think mad max and dredd are somehow original)

Movie making by numbers. A computer could write the script, hit the beats, put in the awful dialogue and away you go. 

Which is fine when it makes money.

But it is like they sometimes don't think they need to try anymore. Just tie it together and push it out. 

Outside of the animation people and the score there was zero artistry in that movie. 




 Oh reddit comments did. Yeah I dunno if that counts. 




 Shame on some people for wanting to discuss the movie, shame 




 I think he makes good points.

 




 Maybe he has particular reasons for it. 

Like how I won't pay money to watch the FIFA film etc 




 what a shit trailer
 




 Yeah 30,000 years is the number. http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/21/dogs-may-have-lived-with-humans-30000-years

http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/22/408784216/who-let-the-dogs-in-we-did-about-30-000-years-ago

Which in terms of human history is pretty fucking ancient.

You really are picking the one person to try and one up there sunshine. 

Bad troll or genuine idiot? I can't tell which one you are.
 









 I can't tell if this is trolling or genuine. Either way it's not working. 














 Meet The Spartans is fairly perfect

Southland Tales is a grand failure 
 




 A Sport and a Pastime was recommended to me on here. I have it somewhere, just got distracted. Better pull it out so

 Then the Guardian are saying it is very funny 




 Oh yes I understand. China is an embarrassment in terms of how it treats animals. The same edgy users on here who think torturing live animals to eat to ward off the summer heat  is culturally acceptable are the same ones who will criticise the very same people who eat rhino horns to get an erection.

 I think it is the reason many fucking hate him. Not that he isn't a good player etc just that the guy dishes it out and yet will throw himself on the floor at any moment 




 it might have made you feel smarter I dunno

 




 I mentioned the blackout in china which is upcoming for a couple months (chinese only films)

I wonder did this create a kind of push to see this before it came into effect  




 I must be looking at different eggs 




 It's the wild west now in digital distribution. A few successful voices are very loud and influential and everyone standing in the shadows echoes it because they think they will be the next in line. 




 In what context. Food and agriculture? Ok. Exactly. My point. 

What was yours? 




 As expected, because you have nothing.

(inb4 k or think what you want or something to that effect before you run off...)

Snowflakes, when their awesomely unique idea(l)s are challenged, do quickly turn into cowards 

 




 Eh,

 I never mentioned it, everyone knows this, nothing to do with the reality of musicians earnings

I just explained that point, in the very sentence you pasted. Are you serious? You actually answered your post for me. How everyones knows about the new ways to do those things, but it doesn't change the reality about earnings.

Which was the topic.

  The only way musicians are going to have a chance at making real money from their music is if we do away with record companies, which is what the internet is doing.

And again I said it wasn't, all it did was open the gates and allow millions to scramble for the meagres. No *real* money involved. Only the lucky few will get anything, much like the system with labels.

Again, would you like to come back to the topic on hand and address that?
 




 I know the average redditor is pigshit ignorant but christ the comments across the board regarding this issue, from cultural this to animal that, have been fucking sickening. 

And when you think most redditors are from developed nations with decent educations it makes you wonder where the planet is going.

Oh and the fucking edge. Don't get me started.  




 Way to address nothing there. 

I say again the internet has changed nothing in practical monetary earning terms, it just opened the pool to everyone.

 We are not talking about the new ability to distribute, advertise etc etc, I never mentioned it, everyone knows this, nothing to do with the reality of musicians earnings, but of course you brought it up as some proof how right you are, baffling

I'd ask you to actually argue but I don't think you want to. The fact you really do think you are right is insane to me.  




 We are talking about the internet changing things, dumping labels and allowing artists to earn money.

You go off on a tangent which is irrelevant to the fact that all it has done it made a level playing field for millions, and so with everyone scrambling for money few earn, the exact same way it is now.

Do you understand? 

 , so that's somehow a bad thing? 

Course it is. Most musicians will fucking tell you this. A saturated market is now just fucked.

Deals, beiber, money - yawn - heard it all before. Nothing you say is new. I can't stress this enough. 

Snowflake generation. No doubt in my mind. 




 Why would there be one?

The ignorance of people baffles me. 

And it is the same pathetic 'superior' stance.

 




 I explained it to another user who actually asked instead of just ignorantly preaching off topic as you did. 

And deep down you probably still think you are right and I am just a dumbshit. Christ in fuck. Snowflake generation.

 




 Google human dog relationship in history. Simple.  




 The only thing the internet is doing is making a somewhat open playground for vomit. The chances of making money are probably slimmer considering the sheer numbers who have no gates to cross to get places. No surprise you become famous online or whatever and you still sign with a record company in the end. It's a great online  reddit snowflake generation fantasy but it is not the truth.

Keep in mind the user above didn't even understand his own argument and started going on about organising gigs and all of this.

Nothing to do with it.

And I already know the arguments which are going to come in now. Every time the same ones. 




 No it isn't. The relationship of dog and human is ancient and far more complex. Do some research. 




 Every time the same pathetic 'superior' arguments.  




 No, it really isn't. Everything you will say I have heard before. Comes back to this - no it really isn't.  














  which is what the internet is doing

It really truly isn't 




 who is saying it isn't a parody?

 Interesting, will def watch it at some point.  




  The film begins with a continuous four-minute take that starts on a television screen showing a Hindi soap opera and pulls out into the street, where armed gangs are furiously searching for a man, gunning down anyone in their path who might be his ally. They bomb his house. When the pressure becomes too much to bear, there is a cut, and with it, an exhale. But there is no loss of tension. The film powers forward, relentless, for the next five hours.

Sounds pretty amazing. 




 I think he was taking that into account. 4th or 5th paragraph down lists the few meagre funnies in it.

 Well going from a straight bio, to a film about his capture, then to a film with a tacked on american star and a bizarre contrived love story...

 It really doesn't. It's pretty much identical to the rest of reddit. 

 There seem to be a lot of people here who only go on /r/soccer and one or two other subreddits, avoiding the defaults entirely.

That is not unique. 

I know what it is about.

 If the /r/soccer mods don't share those grievances then why would they shut it down?

Already explained several times. Solidarity, make the voice of the admins across reddit heard, and as it seems as this thing expands a bit the users who are obviously pissed as well.

Burying head in the sand is all this is.

And I am not even talking about fully dark, just 12 hours, or even allow discussion about it instead of yanking posts. 


 




 If you know why then why are you not participating as well?

Even if only for a short time?

 We have no reason to go dark.

Yes you do. I already explaining it to you.

  None of the defaults have asked us for solidarity

Shouldn't need to.

 we have no issue with the admins.

That doesn't change a single sausage.  




 taking my ball etc etc

jesus 




 Seems to be one of many, but you still haven't answered my question, why did you not go dark at all?  Or even investigate why so many defaults have done so? 




 Response to the comment thread in general. Other user talking about internet anarchists.  Not really the issue so stop getting off track. 

I understand irrational hive internet warriors complaining but this is not that.

 




 it is about reddit and /r/soccer is a part of reddit and your account and your opinions and voice are too

thinking you are special and an island and above the rest of us is cringe

grow up 




 no it is an issue for the whole of reddit

look at /r/all now

you think that is angry teenagers complaining?

sigh

also good job responding to questions, well done
 




 
You have no idea what is going on do you?

SRD top post I think has a lot of the info

Go read and then when you have some information come back 




 You are not separate in any way.

Grow up. 




 12 hours and they'll be back

things are getting trippy, why so many people are complaining  




 obviously yes, but this will be removed and mods dont seem to want to explain why

really disturbing

 




 Hive mentality. Some loud people spoke the rest have to maintain their geezer image.

But that really is getting off topic.

Point is people should, and the mods should have went dark for at least 12 hours 

Not doing so is cowardice  




 Or they are pretending they don't, which is very likely, but either way I am shocked that mods didn't take some action.

 




 No I said you are pathetic for ignoring what is going on with the very website you use.

Burying your head in the sand.   




 Bullshit. Fucking snowflakes on here thinking they are special is no different to the rest of reddit. 




 Yes it is. Stop thinking you are separate from the rest of reddit is hysterical. 




 Yes it is, one run by volunteers etc etc etc

 




 Not really the point of what is going on. People on here seem to be talking about it without knowing the facts. 




 This is one of the funniest things I have seen on reddit ever.

Funniest or scariest I am not sure.

No, it isn't. 

Please tell me ye don't actually believe this. 

And the flat out bullshit comments about not knowing what is going on and all of that. 


 




 srd has loads of posts on it explaining it in detail 




 why not? 




 beer 




 No it isn't. Not at all 




 I love the fact you have completely ignored the main point of my response

 your transfer news on reddit... which at the moment has long standing problems that need to be dealt with

So if you do have other accounts and have been here a while you should know what is going on and why the mods are pissed off and that this is not just about someone being fired

of course you would know that wouldn't you

instead your response is I don't care what goes on I just want my transfer news

that's pretty pathetic  




 most people on here think this is just about someone being fired

and they also seem to think this sub and its users are somewhat special snowflakes separate from the rest of reddit

 




 some places reporting what had happened

but again this is not just about her being fired, if anyone on here bothered to read up about it

jesus christ like

Right there.

In the very post you responded to.

 




 Most people who jump on downvoted comments are indeed trying to score karma so yes you probably were. 




 or perhaps because most videos posted with similar titles (irish something doing something) are either comical or tragic?

and I clicked it thinking it will be one of those and instead its just people talking about game development

but go on with the edgy cunt comments, I'm sure you'll reap some karma with that

 I think both of ye have points.

For me it is the constant nature of the updates, the almost immediate call and response.

When there was time between such things I think someone in a certain mindset could focus better and do their own thing.

Now half the time you feel like giving up because you heard X Y and Z already did it. 




 Not sure but man did they unleash the hate

 Yeah no 




 hello 




 Don't bother. Guy is circlejerk as far as I can see, although I think he actually believes all the nonsense he is saying.

I gave a coherent polite response, he basically in our conversation has now tried to dismiss it twice, ignored it when I responded to his concerns (had to do it again and repeatedly ask him if there were any more), and failed to bring up any relevant points

then I  watched as the conversation lead to a fixation on the word 'junk', to some attempt at entering a philosophical convo about the nature of knowing, and then onto the easy dismissal of both of us being too tired.

Bizarre creature. 

Scary thing is I think he really believes he is not just iamverysmart he actually believes he is having a brilliant discussion on reddit and just destroying everyone.

Avoid.  




 Yeah I am.

Downvotes, hiding, negative karma, eomtional aspects, delays, all parts of downvoting.

 Man you really need some rest. 

No I am pretty sure everything I said was perfectly coherent and correct.


 




 No I am pretty confident in my posts. More so - 100%.

 




 I'm proposing removing the downvotes, that was the very first thing I said.

And downvotes and hiding go hand in hand.

WTF man.



 




  And is that going to change when all people have is upvotes? 

Yes, I already explained this.

 The posts which go against the hive for example will still be visible without having to click anything, not get downvoted into negatives, which hides them, and if a low karma user can subject them to that delay in posting.

I already said this. 





 




 No, it is impossible. That is a fact of life. No one can truly know what another feels and thinks. 

But again, it's got nothing to do with my ideas about removing downvotes.

  I wrote a lengthy reply there.

The long response? Yeah it doesn't address my points at all.

 I wouldn't call it "criticism" as I haven't heard of a single decent proposed alternative. Without a suggestion, it's not criticism, it's just (to put it bluntly) whining.

I gave you one, showed how it works, showed the benefits, and answered your concerns.

I really don't understand what you are looking for.





 




 Yes to an extent. 

I am more concerned with the negatives, take /r/movies for example, go and give a 200 word post about how you think QT is shallow and you will get downvoted, an innocuous comment about Marvel will get you downvoted etc

 I suppose part of my issue is that removing downvotes means we can't downvote these things to help get actual commentary to the top, but that's already not happening. 

IMO the hive is too strong 




 Do I trust the mods. Statistically, over the hive, I would say yes.

I have mentioned a true appeal system on reddit before. I'd love to see one in place. 

 And to what end? What's really bad about the current system? All you provided was the adjective "junk".

What is wrong is that perfectly fine opinions are constantly getting downvoted because the hive disagrees with them.

In essence, using your terminology, they are being 'punished' for expressing their genuine opinion, because the hive does not agree with their POV.

We are not talking about anything offensive or anything like that, just a genuine opinion expressed cleanly - that is what I am talking about.

But I've already said that as well. So I am confused as to why you accused me of just saying 'junk'.

I think my point has been quite clear from the start. Removing downvotes so that peoples genuine opinions which go against the hive remain and are not 'punished' by the hive.

 




 But it's impossible. So instead you concentrate on the results of  rather than knowing the actual reasons.


It happens, what can we do about it - that's what we are talking about.

Put that aside, it really is not the issue.

I cannot truly know why another person does anything.

but - I do know that plenty of perfectly sound opinions are downvoted in certain threads as they go against the hive.

That's all I can work with.



You said I supposedly didn't answer your concerns - I showed you again my answers (which were already in the thread.)

I'm confused as to what you are trying to get at.

And I am being polite as hell about it so can you please explain have I dealt with your questions about the downsides of no downvotes? or where there others?

Because your responses now seem to be pushing towards the philosophical  




  Removal (by mods) work, but that's
Placing a lot of burden on the mods, and

 Not really punishing the poster, because deletion does nothing to your profile.

This is what I got. Is this what you are referring to?

Mods - that is their job, and they can get more if needed, already addressed that.

" If more mods are needed get them, it's not a paid position, plenty of willing people."

Yeah downvotes used as punishments... eh, yeah back to my original point -

"The reddit hive cannot be trusted to act reasonably, especially not about emotive topics."


So in fact I had already addressed both of these in the thread.

Is there some post I am missing ?

I'm trying to meet you half way here.  




 Yes, why would anyone ever try to explain the personal motivations of why anyone does anything? It is impossible.

No one can truly know the intentions of another.

 No, it's okay. Like I said, I'm fine with the discussion ending here.

I politely asked you to. Please, for my own sake. 




 Track it down and ring the number on it is best bet

I heard there is some public nuisance thing but everyone says the guards do fuck all

 




 And yet after X number of hours it is supposed to be public nuisance under new laws? 




  So you refuse to acknowledge the reason other people upvote things

No I didn't, I never mentioned it.

This is not really up for argument. I didn't once mention anyones reasons for upvoting anything.

I said they routinely upvote 'junk' as you call it. I never mentioned why they did anything. It would be pointless.



 I gave you one,

I'm just out of a day long boring coding class and my eyes are tired -  sorry do me one small favour and just point me to it
 




 Because reddit is mainly 15 year olds who have never been in a relationship over 6 months 




  So you refuse to acknowledge the reason other people upvote things, and just dub those as "junk", 

No I didn't.

Never once approached it.

 and you refuse to acknowledge there might be downsides to your proposal?

There aren't. 

All it does is allow everyone the equal voice of 1 upvote and no downvoted into negatives which hide the comment and if you are a newish user start the ridiculous delay process which prevents you from posting often.

Any site rule breaking content will be reported and removed by mods. If more mods are needed get them, it's not a paid position, plenty of willing people. In fact the inability to downvote certain comments in a thread could lead to them being ignored more often, as many people go to the negatives first to read the nasty comments.

There are absolutely no negatives in my idea.

If you can think of one I'd love to hear it. 


 




 Good. Disgraceful incident.  




 You already did. They upvote the equivalent of 'first' to the top.

There are no downsides. All it does it prevent things from being downvoted into the negatives and hidden. If they are against site rules they are reported and removed by mods. If they are fine but go against the hive they remain in view.

Nothing else to it.  




 Looks pretty shit. Wait for the film. But looks very stylish and light hearted

 




 About what?

Guy did like two bank jobs and got knocked up. 




 Great actor.

 




 The reddit hive cannot be trusted to act reasonably, especially not about emotive topics.

They routinely upvote junk to the top, and routinely downvote peoples opinions because they disagree with them. Some try the old 'you didn't explain yourself properly' bullshit line so they can feel superior about the fact they are one of the hive but that's about it.

That will never change. 

Only solution is to remove the ability to do so.

 




 Remove downvotes completely. I don't think it is possible though. 

No downvoting into negatives to hide comments which in turn attracts the hive to automatically downvote and brings out the downvote trolls who comment or insult just to get upvotes themselves.

All opinions unless blatantly against site rules should remain.

 




 interesting idea 




 This is pretty much the first shower thought that hit home.

 




 Guy should be banned for a year  




 Nice to see this instead of the braindead iamsosmart justification of that festival in china.  




 Reddit in general. check our /r/flicks if you want some decent non intensive movie stuff 




 vidal fingered a guys ashole? 




 THOR 2 




 nICE? 









 That guy should be shamed. I'd pull the team from the competition. 




 cherry crabbies? never seen before 




 So right. These interchangeable directors, who are they? I check their IMDBs and barely recognise things until boom they got a huge film. 

So I go check above. Oh yeah he did that film 20 years ago which was okay. Then some crap and tv and then he got thor. 

Are the studios so confident they don't require anyone with a vision because of their involvement? Do they just get a blank slate to come in and direct their product? Because that is what it feels like.

The scripts are just well I dunno. 

Jurassic World was the same. The Avengers is getting there.
