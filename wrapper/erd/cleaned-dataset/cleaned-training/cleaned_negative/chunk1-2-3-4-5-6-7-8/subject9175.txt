 Possibly Escaflowne 




 V/H/S 2 is pretty good as well. 




 I shouted at the screen for the last five minutes. 




 God yes! And, when you think about it  [](#s "you realise that there is no real threat and that only real villain is the now helpless old woman who dies half way through the film! ") 




 Sleepaway Camp  














 It's been a while.

Had a shithouse day?

Send me a message and I'll send you a pizza. 




 Can anyone suggest a good Melbourne based web designer to help me put together a basic site for my business?

I'm looking for someone creative (read, artsy) who is also professional.

 



















 I watched Zombieland recently and it made me feel ill. However, M* A* S* H, Buffy and Heartbreak High (Australian soap for teens I grew up on) all eclipse their cinematic origins.

 









 I've recently given up reading Empire and listening to film podcast because I got sick of spoilers and bad reviewes. Just because the film is called [](#s "Seeking Friend For The End Of The World") doesn't mean [](#s "the world is going to end in the movie") so don't mention that fact in the film! 

I'm also sick of the obsession with focusing on whether the reviewer liked or disliked the film. That was important when we had only papers to tell us if films were worth watching, now, with the internet, we can get a sense of quality in seconds. 

I want **real** analysis! Make me think!

 


































 I run a weekly variety show called The Variety Collective which I shamelessly PLUG here ever once and a while.

We're currently looking for new acts who'd like to perform at the show. We book professional and semi-professional performers including magicians, circus performers, sideshow artists, clowns (the good ones, not the creepy American style ones), musicians with gimmick and pretty much any other skill based entertainment you can think of. 

If you know of anyone or are a performer yourself it would be great to hear from you. 

 



















 I love con artist movies.

I just wrote a book on them which is coming out next year.

So, if you can name a con artist movie that I haven't seen I'll give you some sweet, sweet gold. 

I'm pretty picky about what films I consider con artist movies. (Ocean's 11, The Usual Suspects, The Thomas Crown Affair don't count I'm afraid)

 I remember having nightmares about this scene from Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzolCu-QLw0

Now, I don't know what I was so scared of. 



 




 For me it's always been Invasion of The Body Snatchers (1978).

http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/InvasionOfTheBodySnatchers1978/invasion23.jpg

Even the Mad Magazine parody gave me nightmares.
What's yours? Post screenshots if you've got them. 




 Pick your favourite scene using special effect created with latex, models, perspective, stunts, explosions rather than CGI. 

Link to a video or pic if you can. 












































 Often, a movie adaptation will improve on the original book. The following are films I feel are an improvement on the source material. I've used spoiler tags as most relate to the ending.

Breakfast at Tiffany's
[spoiler] (#s  "The introduction of the love interest and the rain-soaked finale makes for a cheesy conclusion but I love it all the same.")

Fight Club [spoiler](#s  " 'You met me at a very strange time in my life" and then Boom! In the books, the attacks fail and he ends up in hospital.' ")

Matchstick Men [spoiler](#s "The reunion in the carpet store and the reconciliation with the wife  after the finale twist doesn't appear in the novel and it's kind of a downer.")

Thank You For Smoking [spoiler](#s "In the film, he becomes a hero and returns to work. In the book, he becomes an anti-smoking advocate.")

First Blood [spoiler](#s "In the original novel, Rambo is the bad guy and is shot to death. In the film, he is a troubled veteran whose actions are understandable.")

The Mist [spoiler](#s "In the film, he shoots his young son in the head to save him from the monsters in the fog not realising that help the sounds he hears is the army on the way. In the book, they simply drive into the mist.")

What are your favourites?



 


































 Listening to the radio a few weeks back, they were talking about the 'Dumb Ways To Die' video and it's success. 

One of the guests, who works in advertising, suggested that the advertisement's goal is NOT to make people safe around trains but to make Metro more likeable. 

It's much harder to be cynical about a whimsical safety advertisement than a whimsical crappy-public-transport-authority advertisement.

 A few people have bought up the Melbourne Magic Festival in the past few days so, as one of the organisers, I thought I'd start a one-stop thread for people to ask questions, make requests and post Arrested Development quotes.

The festivals runs from 1-13 July at Northcote Town Hall.

 I saw a guy ram a car with his motorcycle today and then swear at the driver. 

Sadly for him, the car was an unmarked police car and the driver and his passenger were cops.

The sirens went on and the jerk freaked out, sprinted across Bell Street and dove head first over the eight foot high fence before disappearing into the scrub around Merri Creek.

The cops took after him and the last thing I saw before the lights changed and I had to drive away was the podgy copper trying to scale the fence after him.

It was like something out of The Bill. 




 In hindsight, saying 'nothing sus' makes it sound sus.

I need a talented under 18 year old musician to do three songs for a gig on 5 June. It's a variety show (comedy, magic, circus etc.) and we need a shit hot musical act. 

There is some money involved which is nice. In the past, we've had everything from piano accordions and choirs to MCs and standard covers. 

Hit me up at info@conman.com.au or below. 












































 I do a show about scams and con artists and had a gig last night at Parliament House. Security searched my bag and, after seeing what I was carrying, decided to call the police.

My evening ended with me being interrogated by the Australian Protective Services for 20 minutes while they did a background check on me. 

"But officer, I'm an HONEST con man..." didn't seem to cut it.

In hindsight, trying to bring a hammer, two nails, a sharp knife, a lock picking set, two loaded dice and a small bottle of lighter fluid into the building might have been a mistake. 














 I'm putting together a board game event in July and I am looking for groups that might be keen to have some input on the show.

 I've three double passes to my comedy festival show.

It's looking like a quiet night and I've got the Herald Sun reviewing my show. All the other reviews have been glowing but getting a nice review in print would be great. 

The show is an expose of my time as a regular on Today Tonight and all the awful things you didn't know about that show (as well as the awful things you already do know) 

If you're keen, email me at info@conman.com.au

PS - I've tried not to make this a blantant plug for the show. I'm really just giving away some tix.

EDIT 2: - The reviewers have asked to SWAP night to WEDNESDAY! So if anyone would like to come WEDNESDAY night, please email info@conman.com.au. Obviously happy to see the comps who are coming tonight!

 I'm looking for someone who is enthusiastic and friendly who'd like to hand out flyers for me for my comedy festival show tonight (and several other nights) from 7:15-9:15 in town.

I can afford $15 per hour. 

Let me know if you're keen.   














 I help run a weekly show at The Brunswick Green. Every few weeks we invite a few redditors for free to get new audiences.

This week, I have three double passes. Hit me up on info@conman.com.au if you want one.

 I've been developing a simple yet kind of addictive card game over the past year. The idea is for players to act as spiders and spin a web to help win a prize. Players can cut, tangle and steal each other's webs.

There are pictures that explain the game better here at the facebook page I set up the other day...

https://www.facebook.com/danglegame

Have you seen a similar game before?

 




 I need a QUALIFIED handy man to build some floor to ceiling, wall to wall shelves. The job with probably involved a bit of joinery.

Any recommendations? 




 I opened my stand up show Today Tonight, Tomorrow the World last year in Melbourne and couldn't have done it with the support of all the redditors who plugged it and came along.

So i'm paying it forward and giving away some free tickets to my show at Gluttony for the next two weeks. 

We had a full house last night and comments from twitter said:

"Just saw Today Tonight. Magnificent! Highly recommend." - @screamcreative2

"go see this show! you will be surprised!" @traceymathers 

"This is a brilliant show, everyone should see this show, very smart comedy." lebby panaayiotu. 

If you'd a free double pass hit me up on email to info@conman.com.au with the date you want to come (I'm on until the 9 March).

www.conman.com.au/todaytonight

EDIT: Thanks for the love guys. Had a few redditors come in and see the show last night. It's a tough fringe for performers so it's nice to know I have friends out there. I can spare a few more tickets if anyone missed out.  














 I run The Variety Collective every week at The Brunswick Green on Sydney Road. 

We have a rusted on fan base of people who come every week to watch comedy, magic etc.

I'd like to bring in a new audience so I thought I'd give a few double passes to my reddit friends.

Send me an email to info@conman.com.au.

https://www.facebook.com/events/362457663861245/?fref=ts

EDIT ONE: A few tickets left...I'll let you know when they are all gone. 
























 TO: Goodlife Health Clubs, Australia
SUBJECT: Are you shitting me?

I quit your crappy gym FIVE YEARS ago. 

You wouldn't take no for an answer and spammed me for MONTHS afterwards. 

I had to threaten legal action to get you to stop sending your damn crappy emails.

And now, in 2013, you've started again.

I'd rather sit alone in my house, morbidly obese eating shake-a-pancake from the bottle than ever deal with you people again. 

Sod off.

 ...and my damn iphone just ran out of juice.

Was it pair of docs? Or a paradox? 

EDIT:

 I was looking at the Kickstarter/Pozible projects I've supported and there isn't really a pattern to what I like. Sometimes I'm just on the bandwagon, other times I just want to know the game EXISTS (even if I don't play it)

What makes you support a campaign?

 









 I can only clearly remember two scenes.

One, involved a politician, possibly the prime minister standing on balcony shouting insanely while an aide tries to convince to take cover. Moments later, a nuclear bomb goes off.

The other, set after the apocalypse, sees a group of people kept in a cage while lions and tigers circle them as the new ruling class laugh at this 'reverse zoo'

it was a really disturbing satire of the politics of the time. 

(it's NOT Threads :) ) 
 









 I'm looking to print my first card game and I've been recommended contacting this Indian company. 

http://www.playingcardsindia.com

Has anyone ever played any of the games they have printed? Or can you offer me any advice or picking a printer?

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: The game I am creating is called Dangle (http://danglegame.tumblr.com)

 




 I love film but I am entirely sick of our culture's obsession with ranking, rating and reviewing them. 

I don't really care if a critic thinks a film is good or bad, I'm more interested in analysis, interesting trivia and where a movie fits in the history of film.

I spend less time here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1478964/reviews
and more time here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1478964/trivia

Can anyone suggest any good podcasts I can listen too?

 









 I'm looking to print a 100 card game next year and I'm looking at various options for printing.

The game involves a lot of laying down and picking up card from the table so I really need something thick and high quality.

I've check out game crafter but I'm looking for other ideas.

Thanks for any help! 







































 Been sick as a dog this week. I thought it was food poisoning but it's hung around for days.

Is there a nasty stomach virus going around?  









 It turns out there is some sort of sporting event on tomorrow night, the second night of my Fringe Festival show which means tickets sales are down a little. 

Since redditors were nice enough to come out to my test show back in August, I thought I'd throw out five double passes for the Saturday night show. 

The show is called Today Tonight, Tomorrow The World and tells the tale about how I sold my soul to the most infamous show on Australian television, Today Tonight!

Send me an email at info@conman.com.au to score one of the double passes.

https://www.facebook.com/events/412320292137593/ 
























 I'm putting on a show in a few weeks about being a little bit famous.

Have you ever been on TV or in a movie? 

What did you do?

https://www.facebook.com/events/412320292137593/ 




 I'm in town for a few days and I keep hearing people dissing Melbourne.

I didn't know this was a thing. 

Also, people keeping telling me a look like a pedophile and/or hipster. 

Is there a big problem with hipsters/pedophiles in Sydney?

 









 It's that time again.

Had a shit house day?

Send me a message and I'll send you a pizza.



 




 Had a shitty day?

Time for a random act of pizza.

Send me a message and I'll send you a piping hot pizza.

EDIT: Pizzas are all gone for tonight. May the pizza gods smile on you. 



 




 I'm hoping to put on a free night of comedy while I'm in Sydney in a couple of nights.

I'll be previewing my new one man show before it premieres at Melbourne Fringe Festival at the end of the month. I did a preview earlier this week in Melbourne and it went quite well.

All I need is a small space with a bar and possibly a data projector.

Any ideas of where I could I put on such a night?
Would you guys like to come?

https://www.facebook.com/events/412320292137593/

 




 I suffer from anxiety, particularly relating to money and bookkeeping. Often, if I make a mistake on an invoice, I don't get paid rather than go through the stress of resending the account. It's a serious problem that I'm slowly working through.

As such, I just can not handle complicated book keeping software. I've been using a 20 year old copy of MS Money for years which has a basic ledger (income/expense) which has finally stopped working. I'm a sole trader who provides a service.

I need to upgrade but I can't find a piece of software I can handle. All I need is to track income and expense taking into account a 10% sales tax. (GST, I'm in Australia).

I'm working on Mac if that helps.

Thank you in advance for any advice you can give. 




 I'm trying to plug an event and I'm looking for good, free Melbourne gig guides (like Eventfinder or OnlyMelbourne).

Are there any that use or like? 




 Fans of This American Life will already know who Mike Birbiglia. He's a comedian who, with the help of Ira Glass, has made a hilarious movie called "Sleepwalk with Me"

http://movies.mmgn.com/Videos/SLEEPWALK-WITH-ME-Official-Trailer

It's only being shown at a handful of cinemas in the US and it would be awesome to bring it to Melbourne. 

Joss Wedon thinks this is a bad idea: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj6_020FFXU

If you want this awesome film in Melbourne, head over to Cinema Nova's facebook page and twitter and ask them nicely.

 FREE COMEDY and AMA.

In October, I'm premiring a brand spanking new show at Melbourne Fringe.

It's a stand up comedy show about the time I appeared on Today Tonight, meeting Naomi Robson and getting screwed over by the show. 

It's called 'Today Tonight, Tomorrow the World'

I'm having a test run of the show on 28 August at The Brunswick Green and I'd really like to get some complete strangers along to laugh at my jokes or throw puppies if you hate it. (please don't throw puppies. It's not their fault I'm not funny)

https://www.facebook.com/events/412320292137593/

If anyone has any other ideas on how to get some people along to check out some free comedy, let me know.

Thanks. 

PS - You don't HAVE to hate Today Tonight but it helps.

PPS - Ask me anything about myself, Today Tonight or comedy.

EDIT - I've had 50 people email me at info@conman.com.au to book a seat. However, you might still get a seat if you just show up on the night.

EDIT - If you miss out on the preview, here is the Melbourne Fringe link. http://www.melbournefringe.com.au/fringe-festival/show/today-tonight-tomorrow-the-world/ 




 I am super pumped.

The Melbourne Magic Festival is on next week. I just found out the first show (the gala) I'm in has sold out.

Is anyone planning on going?
 




 I currently live in Northcote and I'm thinking of moving cross town to Footscray.

Will I be stabbed in neck?
Will my friends visit me?
 




 I am a magician (hoorah) performing at the Melbourne Magic Festival (hoorah) but I need some help. (boo!)

I'm looking for a 1.25 or 2 litre bottle of coke with someone's name printed on it from that promotion from late last year.

Any name will do!

If you can help, I can even get you a few tickets to a show. We've got stuff for kid's, adults, hipsters, crazy old cat ladies...

 Can someone please explain to me exactly what a Homeowner's Association is?  




 No. Just No. Stalactites is the place you go at four in the morning when everywhere is shut. 




 That man is very attractive. I found it very distracting.
 




 "He's not coming back" 




 I loved it. I don't know how many interminable entitled rich family dramas I've say thought thinking 'I wish someone would come and kill all these people.' 

That said, I think it did go a little too far into schlock at the end.  




 I thought it was too soon to be in other formats. 

I sing Space Oddity to my daughter as a lullaby. We took her to see the movie at the drive in. She slept through it. 




 I didn't realise this was available as a download.  




 As little respect I have for Hubbard and his 'works' there is little evidence he actually said this. This article covers both sides.

 Then we can finally get The Street Fighter II movie the world deserves!  




 Heath Ledger slowly opens his eyes surrounded by machines and chemicals.

"What happened?" 

"Mr Ledger. You've been dead for fives years." says the scientist. "But, with the latest technology, we've been able to cheat death itself and raise you, like Lazarus, from your grave. We don't have long though. The process is only temporary."

"Oh god! Thank you! I'll have one more chance to hold my daughter. To say a proper goodbye to my family. I'll be able talk to Michelle. I always regretted how things ended between us. Thank you for this second chance!"

"I'm sorry Mr Ledger. There isn't much time and we need you to make another Batman movie."

 




 Cancer? 




 I agree. All characters in all movies should be played by a beiged coloured, genderless creature with no distinguishing features at all. That's something we can all enjoy.

 I'd suggest re-reading what you just wrote and having another stab at it. You might have a point in there somewhere but your sentences make little sense.

EDIT: Your/you're dammit. 




 Not really. Every time an article mentions the test, its limitations are mentioned.  




 Huzzah. Dropped twenty bucks.  




 It says zero days left!  




 Rainbow attracts a very different audience to Edinburgh Gardens.  




 Technically, it was promoted by Melbourne City Council as a place to watch the fireworks last year. 10,000 people showed up and trashed the park. This year, Yarra City Council begrudgingly provided some services.  
 




 You're an idiot. 

Asking people to use a bin is not the same as asking people not to have an abortion. 

 




 It's only a disaster if you live in the area. 




 I'm calling bullshit. While there might be true events that inspired filmmakers to create a fictional work, there is no way most of these films are 'based on' true stories. 

 




 I had the opposite reaction. Wait? The  guy who made Braindead/Dead Alive, Meet The Feebles and Bad Taste is being given millions to make Lord of The Rings? 




 Steven Sodeburgh always surprised me. Magic Mike, Haywire, Schizopolis 




 You'll need to google it like I did.  




 I do that all the time. I was trying to google 'Racist Mascots' the other week and my mind wandered half way through. Long story short, I now have the phrase 'Racist Masturbation' on my search history.   




 My daughter is 36. She's getting really sick of my shit.  




 George R. R. Martin bought an old movie theatre and watches films from the cry room so we can enjoy the movie without the rest of the audience noticing him as the owner/author. 

http://www.npr.org/2013/10/07/227772024/george-r-r-martin-author-and-movie-theater-guy 




 I take my daughter to the drive in and the special bring your babies sessions.  




 Also, cash converters.  




 Also, don't use a boxcutter. Good advice. 




 It. Not I. Sorry. I should have been clearer. 




 He was in the movie so, yes. Yes, I do.

EDIT: Clarity. 




 He could have played Parker too.  




 I know right? How DARE they feel bad when someone tells a racist joke? I feel so oppressed. 




 Sadly, the large majority of people who make racist jokes lack the cognitive abilities to be able to tell whether their friends is smiling politely or genuinely amused. 

I have friend who CONSTANTLY makes Jew jokes. He just does not get that it offends and annoys our jewish friends, despite what they tell him.

 




 This, a thousand times over.

 Life is Beautiful killed me.  




 Fun fact! This is called Gestalt's Law of Continuity. With information removed, our brains tend to fill in that information by continuing the already existing pattern. In this case, we imagine the nude woman because all we see is skin. SCIENCE!

 I really enjoyed Side By Side. Keanu Reeves' contribution to film is underrated, even if his acting isn't.   




 Is that the Saddam Hussein one?
 




 Where can I see it? 




 But we're in love with the IDEA of them. That counts right?
 




 My pick is Fortress (1986) the Australian horror film about a group of children and their teacher kidnapped for ransom. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfTkKaSZFyk

 Coburg is a great suburb but Pentridge Village is not great. It has a depressing vibe and isn't really near very much of interest.

 Shane Maloney's series is fantastic. The protagonist is a political fixer for the ALP at a state level during the Kennett years. http://shanemaloney.com/books.

 The most depressing piece of movie trivia is about the 14 year old girl from The Crow. 

 After the death of Brandon Lee on the set of The Crow, she had to return to the set in order to film the scene in which Eric Draven says "Sarah, I do care." with a body double in the character of Draven, but did not appear in another film until 2009 




 That's a long commute. 

To be honest, it was a charity raffle and I didn't really want any of the stuff in the basket that desperately. (except maybe the box of favourites) 




 I don't know, my wife would probably not be too keen on the idea... 




 nah, that's ok...i guess. 
 




 Woah! There was an ICE CREAM MAKER? Deals off, I'm coming to get it. :) 




 If you could provide us with a list of the wonderful crap in the basket, that would be great! 




 Or lazy :) 




 Thanks 




 Cool, is your real name Alannah Rose? 




 It's a raffle I entered full of random stuff. DVDs, Gardening supplies etc. I live in Preston and don't want to make the journey. 

EDIT 

Turns out the gift basket contained an ice Cream Maker, Two Nickelodeon DVDs, a man dvd boxset, a pack of screwdrivers, a portable gas bbq, a 30 metre hose, wooden blocks that spell HOME, a box of Favorites and two bottles of Wine. 


 









 Here in Australia we had thing happen. After 35 people were killed in a 1996 massacre, the conservative Prime Minister, immediately put a strict control on guns

 Independence Day 

The Americans have had a non functioning alien spaceship since the fifties. What if they were able to study the ship and use what the learnt as a basis for modern computing.

This would make it more believable that the two systems work in a similar enough way to connect the ships.

 Sweet holy crap. Count the number of skulls on the black and white pencil in both shots you said lonely little man.

 I read this today on the IMDB page of Rochelle Davis, the 14 year old girl who played Sarah in the The Crow. It broke my heart.

*After the death of Brandon Lee on the set of The Crow, she had to return to the set in order to film the scene in which Eric Draven says "Sarah, I do care." with a body double in the character of Draven, but did not appear in another film until 2009.* 




 One of my favourite films of all time.  




 Neil Hope, much like the character he played, lost his parents young and struggled with alcoholism after Degrassi. He died in 2007.

What's really sad it the general public didn't realise he had passed until last year. 
 









 I feel genuinely happy for that man. It probably made the mascot's day too. 




 Die Hard 4.0.

 My favourite review quote so far. 

"The Crocodile Dundee II of superhero films-in a good way!" - Slate

 




 I read that whole storyline when it first came out. I was 13 at the time and read it at my local newsagent/newstand after school. I'd finish school, go to the shop and read a couple of pages of the latest issue until the owner told me to get lost.

It was the first comic storyline I read from start to finish and has coloured all of my reading since. 
 




 I work as a writer and consultant on con artists and scams so this is somewhat my specialty subject. 

Most 'real world' pickpockets lack the delicate skill of pickpocket entertainers or 'honest' pickpockets. After all, some one like Apollo will steal the watch off your wrist even after he's told you that he is going to. 

Street pickpockets rely on crowds, heavy misdirection and teamwork to steal your belongings. Entertainers have to do it under a literal spotlight.

Bob Arno is also very good but, if you're looking for a teacher, Apollo can not be beat.

 This is brilliant.  




 Hipsters aren't that bad! They're they ones who listen to all the new shitty music and find the good stuff so the rest of us don't have to! 

 




 Really not a fan of that film. The opening 10 minutes is an amazing piece of film making but the rest feels like a series of oscar baiting cameos and mindless patriotism.   




 There is nothing natural about riding a horse so hard that it breaks it's leg, something that happens regularly in the horse racing industry. 

There is employment in many, many terrible things in the world, that does not mean we should continue doing them.  




 The danger of running is that their leg snaps to the point of having to kill it where it lays

How is that not dangerous? Or cruel?

The horse racing industry know of the risk they are putting these animals into and they continue to do it.

 


 




 Bullshit! This activity puts horses into dangerous positions again and again and then kills them when they are injured.

 I don't know the context of his remarks but, based on what I know about Smith, he's talking about mean spirited critics and internet haters.

 IF you pay, they'll want more. If you refuse to pay, they'll expose you.

The best idea would be to waste their time. Slow down the process. Ask them questions about Western Union. Make excuses. Act confused. 

There is a chance they will just expose you anyway but the scammer knows he can only expose you once and so will be unlikely to give up on you if he just thinks you're incompetent. 

 




 Aside from scam baiting them, there isn't a lot you can do. Depending on the country of origin, scam baiting CAN be effective in slowing down the swindlers.

If the scam came from Nigeria, chances are it's linked to organised time and all you'd be doing is wasting the time of some low level wage slave.

If the scam came from Ghana then you'd be dealing with a sole trader whose time is precious and who can't afford to waste time on red herrings and dead ends. 

Realistically, the best thing you and your friend can do is tell the story to as many people as possible. The more people who know, the harder it is for the scammers.

 A group of university students accidentally kill a girl and dispose of the body. One of the groups gets arrested that night for stealing a car that was involved in the girl's death. The rest of the group let him go to prison for the car theft.

Years later, he gets out of prison and begins tormenting the group with what they did, threatening their now perfect lives. 

At the end of the movie  [spoiler](/s "the tormenter forces the group to help dig up the girl's body. Thinking he is about to expose them all they kill the man. They then discover the shallow grave actually contains a dummer. They then find out the girl was never murdered and that the death was an elaborate prank. He never told them it was a prank because they let him go to jail for the car theft. ")

 Last Action Hero, while a fun movie was panned at the time for being endemic of the bloated budget, mindless action movies of the time. Ironically, it was criticised for being the very kind of film it was trying to parody.

The project was passed from director to director and screenwriter to screenwriter taking on comedy, action and fantasy elements as it went. One minute the film is a sad tale about a boy who worships the movie, the next a rollicking adventure adventure and then suddenly a child gets thrown to his death off a building. And oh look, an animated cat.

The studio just kept throwing money and resources at the movie trying to make it into the summer blockbuster it could never be.

And then Jurassic Park was released in the same week and the whole thing fell apart. The movie, which isn't awful, was humiliated by the success of both Spielburg's film and Sleepless in Seattle.

 They should put that on IMDB.  




 As an Australian let me just make sure I've got this straight, this commercial was 'controversial' because they were speaking foreign languages and not English

And all this is is despite the fact English IS a foreign language from, you know, England and is just one of 330 spoken in the country, over 175 of which are indigenous?

EDIT: AND, I've just learned, English isn't even the official language of America!

 In his own words...

 The show most go on... Yesterday during one of my escape street shows... I had this happen. 
 
 I was tired up, for my friends that have not seen it, in a large canvas drawstring sack., then bound with tips ropes. Also my thumbs were taped together. I had a crowd of about 150 people watching,. 
 
 At this point I'm pretty much like an upside down spittle. 
 
 Out of nowhere this crazy guy rugby tackles me knocking me to the ground and falling on top of me. A couple of other performer came and dragged the guy off. His mate was recording it for YouTube as a stunt. They then both ran off. Somehow I regained my composure and explained to the audience and children how stupid it was. I finished the show in mega pain but full of adrenalin. I went home very sore and after not being able to lay down went the the hospital where I spent most of the night waiting to be seen(not complaining many people needed help before me) 
 
 The outcome is that he broke 2 of my ribs and I am now on very song painkillers. It will take 6 weeks to mend. 
 
 I am up after 2 hours sleep and on my way to do a gig. 
 
 If anyone sees a YouTube of this please let me know, it had been reported to the police and they are investigating cctv footage.

The mentos reaction occurs because the surface of mentos are covered in tiny simples. Each dimples serves as a nucleation point for carbon dioxide in the coke. The gas gathers around each little dimple making a bubble.

If the dimples are filled with water/ice then you'll get no bubbles.

Try filling a DRY glass with coke. You get lots of foam because there is lots of dust and other imperfections. Now fill a WET glass with coke. Very few bubbles.

Stupid jerk science ruining my fun.

 Yes. Absolutely.  




 There's a lot of strings visible in Dance Magic Dance

 I thought the son was Daniel Mcpherson from Neighbours and couldn't figure out what was wrong with him. 




 Yes! It's the only blemish on a near perfect film. 




 You shut your damn mouth sir/madam.

That film was lovingly hand animated. Each frame consists of layer upon layer of beautifully rendered art.

It is a homage to classic animation that has stood the test of time better than any CGI.

You sir/madam, are worse than ~~Hitler~~ George Lucas. 




 When I saw The Sixth Sense, I didn't even know that the boy saw dead people, let alone the twist.

 I'm sad to say that Mel Gibson is an American. Born there, lives there. He had him for a few years when he was not too crazy but that's about it. 




 I've never understand why Americans think Australians speak like South Africans. Robert Downey Junior in Tropic Thunder gets it. Why can't the rest of youse?  




 David Gale: So, basically, you feel, to choose another quote, 'society must be cleansed of elements which represent its own death.'

Details. :) 




 I'm not really interested in ranking them. Even the weakest film is still pretty damn good. 

Also, each move builds on the strengths of that which went before. By itself, The Avengers would be a bit of a mess. Wait? Who is this doctor and why is everyone scare of of him? Why is turning into a monster? There is a norse GOD and no one is surprised? 

But, as a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's amazing, a calumniation of years of work and billions of dollars invested. 

There really has been nothing like it in the history of cinema.
 
  




 Everytime they called the song that I wanted to shout 'IT'S CALLED SPACE ODDITY YOU FOOL!" 




 But...why? 




 My concern is that I'm not sure WHY the character is speaking like this. Obviously, I don't know the context but, as it stands, it could mean many things.  




 Sentences like this, my head is hurt by. 




 I'm really upset. They've really stripped the dignity away from the nineties masterpiece. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFLGRidfFo4  




 "The Godfather, A Place In The Sun, Dodsworth, Galaxy Questthese are perfect films" - David Mamet

 As I mentioned in another thread, a good twist is one were the twist is entirely natural and, in hindsight, makes perfect sense but still blindsides the reader. 

In most cases, a good twist also changes how we FEEL rather than what we know. For example, we HATE the evil Jekyll in Jekyll   Hyde and feel for the put upon doctor. When we find out they are the same man, it changes how we feel about the two characters.  

Chuck Palanuik reused that same twist in Fight Club but, because he changed how we felt about the characters, in felt fresh and not cliched.

There are many stories in which we learn the hero is, in reality, dead. The only successful ones are those in which we care about the hero and his or her plight. 

 




 My editor described this to me as 'gotcha' moments rather than 'a-ha' moments. 

A 'gotcha' moment is one where the audience is surprised with a new piece of information that they could not have seen coming, one that appear as if from nowhere. For example, the end of the 2001 Planet of the Apes film. 

An 'a-ha!' moment is one where the twist or development is surprisingly but, with the benefit of hindsight, makes perfect sense. For example, in the original Jekyll and Hyde, the twist that the two men were, in fact, one, is laid out through out the text.

 No it hasn't. It's still used as a derogatory word against gay people. Just because a bunch of sheltered teenagers have decided to claim the word as an all purpose insult, doesn't make it not homophobic.  




 If you don't think the person you're trying to insult is gay and you don't have a problem with gay people, why would you use a word that is specifically designed to insult gay people?

 In one book, the hero is living in the snowy woods. In others, a brother and sister are the heroes.

 The word orient is a western word meaning 'East'. The word is problematic because a) not all of Asia is in the 'east'. b) it is very Eurocentric as it refers to a place only it's location compared with Europe. c)  No one says Oriental anymore. It's like the word Negro. More old fashioned than racist.

 The trouble both films have is [spoilers](#s "making it believable that the two leads could be forced into falling in love. In the original, they resort to "because hypnosis is magic" which works reasonably well and we suspend our disbelief. In the remake, I just don't buy that his plan could be so reliant on the pair sleeping together. There are so many "But what if" moments for it to really work. ") 




 I agree, that was quite disturbing.  









 From IMDB

*The DVD contains a FAKE alternate ending where Average Joe's loses the final match and the film goes to the credits as the announcer exclaims that they are going home with absolutely nothing. This was apparently sacked after test audiences were unhappy with the original ending (Globo Gym wins).* 




 I don't buy it.

It makes no sense, isn't particular funny AND, if you watch the ending on the DVD, it is exactly the same as the final scene, it just slows down and fades to black with Stiller jumping around having won.

I always assumed it was a joke for the DVD extras. 




 The movie moved from family drama to taught home invasion thriller to schlock horror so fast I felt disorientated by the end. That said, I still loved it.

I'm the kind of person who gets half way through a Diane Keaton family dramedy and wishes they'd started knocking people off.

 Perhaps if you are a wild animal or a human long ago.

The beauty of human's evolution of the past few thousand years is we have grown to appreciate intelligence OVER base aggression. 

It is why people, as well as physical attraction, also look for wit and intelligence. The ability to rape is not really something either men or women look for much anymore.

Probably best to remove it from the 'special skills' of your OK cupid profile.

 So the gun would still have some kind of stunning facility even with the cartridge in AND the blast doors obstructed? 




 So it would act as a regular stun gun?

EDIT: I can't see them in any of the pictures. Are they very small?

 My understanding was that you had to remove the cartridge first.  




 I'm not a gun person so please excuse my ignorance. In fact, I'm not even sure a taser *counts* as a gun.

What would happen if you pushed a Taser into a solid surface (the ground, a wall or even a person's chest) and pulled the trigger?

As I understand it, Taser cartridges have blast doors on them that swing open or blow off when the gun is fired, allowing the prongs to fly out.

http://www.taser.com/products/law-enforcement/taser-cartridges

If the Taser was pushed up against a solid surface, I can't see how those doors could open.

Any thoughts how I can stop this guy?  




 Someone needs to stop being a perspective tool 




 With a lot of music, the words themselves don't require literal meaning. Instead it's how they *sound* that gives the song meaning or emotion.

A lot of hip hop is best compared to nonsense verse like Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll or even the experimental works of James Joyce. "

All mimsy were the borogoves / and the mome raths outgrabe." in Jabberwocky doesn't make a lot of sense but sounds great just like "scooby snack jurassic plastic gas booby trap" doesn't mean a damn thing when Ghostface Killah raps it.

In hop hop, the focus is often on the rhythm and lyricism of the words, not what they are saying. I would imagine the trend comes from freestyle rap where in order to keep up with the beat, the rapper drops in nonsense words or words that make no sense in that context.

TL;DR - "The sound of the words is more important than the meaning" said the whitest man ever.

Not a fan of Criss Angel. He uses camera tricks and stooges. I prefer guys like David Kwong and Justin Flom. Check out Wizard Wars. By buddy Rick created it.

Penn and Teller and amazing. The Amazing Jonathan also. I am none of them. I have Jonathan's beard, Penn's physique and teller's hairline.





 




 Thanks, that was brilliant. 

I struggle to find quality designers for my sites. The last great site I had was eight years ago and that company was bought out my a larger operation and their prices increased by 500%. Now, i'm stuck trying to find a good designer who can help me with what I want.

I feel like the only choices I have is to pay $2000-$3000 for a site that isn't what I want or $9 per month for a site that isn't amazing but that I can, at the very least, fiddle with until it limps into usable. 

It's a problem that others in my industry face with many designer their own sites. The two guys I know with great sites by great developers got mates rates from a friend. 




 




 You're...a grandma? 




 Not even sister act 2?!!?!? Now I don't know what to believe

 And makes no sense! 




 Are you new to human interaction? This kind of jackanapery in reddit has being downvoted since forever... 




 Aren't they on html5 now? 




 What about the templates are unprofessional? As a non-designer, I can see sites I do and don't like but I'm not sure what makes them unprofessional.

I have several people in my market with wix sites on the front page of google who've done only basic SEO. I've done a little reading on Ajax crawling and it seems to get the job done.

I've seen terribly designed wordpress sites, many using templates, made by amateurs out of their depth who just don't understand WP's complexities. 

What about a WP site helps non-designers make their own sites easier than wix?






 




 Wix seems to get a lot of hate here. As a non-designer, I struggle to nail people down on EXACTLY what is bad about the site.

For me, the big downside is that anyone can make their own site, which means people who don't know design end up with a dull template OR a design of their own that stinks.

It puts web design in the hands of people who have no business designing sites.

However, if a user has a keen eye for design and doesn't need to complex a site, what is the problem with using Wix?

EDIT: I think I have a better understanding now of the problems a designers have with. Broadly speaking, I see a lot of parallels between this issue and publishing/self-publishing. A lot of publishers get very annoyed with self-published books. The quality is low, they are packed full of mistakes and they price traditional publishers out of the business. However, publishers have had to learn to suck it up and learn to live in a DIY world. Perhaps web designers will too.

 We have our own Brooklyn too.  




 I figured out the the big difference between Australian and American coffee, aside from the style, was the strength. Often, I'd dismiss coffee as being bad when, in reality, it was just week. 

My favourite coffee experience of the trip was at service station half way between LA and Vegas where they had 10 different pots of coffee on the boil, twelve different syrups, six different types of "milk", four types of sweetener and a selection of whipped creams, sprinkles, chocolate etc. 

It summed up the American experience for me. It's a country founded on choice, where they'd rather have a thousand terrible choices than two or three good ones. 




 It was OK. Not great but we told him we loved it.  




 Australians have a rep for being picky (i.e. assholes) when it comes to coffee. 

While I was in New York I tried to find the best coffee place I could. Some hipsters recommended this little hole in the wall near Chelsea Market. Just a counter, a coffee machine and beans. 

The Barista was a massive douche to every single person in line. Soup Nazi levels. 

When we got to the front of the line and he heard our accents his face went white.

"You Australians?"
"Yep."
"From Melbourne?"
"Uh-huh"
"Ok...well...I'll do my best OK?"


 




 Good that stuff is the bane of my existance. So expensive and so many people instagraming pictures of it.

  vaguely unsatisfying theories

 




 So far, it's mostly been old school stuff.

EDIT: She's still a baby but loves bouncing around to NWA, Public Enemy and that Rhymefest cover of Build Me Up. 

EDIT 2: Since I posted this last week she has become obsessed with No Scrubs by TLC. She claps and giggles every time it comes on. This saddens me a little but I have to respect her life choices. 




 Of course, there are several vaguely unsatisfying theories about how he escaped.

1) Few pantries can be locked from the outside. There is a handle on the door. He could have simply let himself out.

2) The axe. We never see where the axe came from. Perhaps he found it in the room.

3) He never escaped. He froze to death in the unheated room and the chase through the maze was his crazed mind created a reason for the lowering temperature.

4) Danny let him out and he knew the maze well enough to get in and out, leaving Jack stuck in the middle. He wanted to kill Jack.

 As a part of building my brand I'm keen to build my indentity as an authority. By creating a website with strong content, I'll get more people knowing who I am and what I do. They'll also link to my content and help my SEO.

The same goes for Social Media. A lot of my customers know me from social media interactions. I'd like the site to feed the social media and visa versa.

People find the site via a) seeing  me at gigs and in the media and b) links to content on social media c) googling my keywords.

I'm pretty good at SEO. I got my crappy old WIX site to number three on google from the seventh page in six weeks.

5) Increase social media followers.

 "New film Old Fashioned is 50 Shades of Grey for Christians, claims its creator"

http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/new-film-old-fashioned-is-50-shades-of-grey-for-christians-claims-its-creator-9636401.html 









 I love each and every one of those movies deeply.  




 Great film! Very true to the original story and an absolute mindfuck. 

The low budget is obvious on occasion but that's a quibble. 




 It's fairly common behaviour among Australian politicians.  




 No, but with metcard, you could buy a ticket on the tram AND were left with a physical record of the purchase. 

Under that system, buying a ticket was simple and easy. 

 




 If they provided a system that allowed people to buy tickets near or on public transport like we had for years before Myki came along, that might be possible. 




 That's right! I'll just walk over to the ticket machine here on the tram...oh it's gone. That's OK, I'll just get one at the next stop...not there either. 

If someone lives nowhere near a 7/11 or a train station, they can not use public transport. 

And even if you carry a fully topped up card with you at all times, the machines STILL will often not scan properly and, unless you go to extraordinary measures, you have no way to prove it.

http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/court-in-the-act--how-commuters-are-defeating-myki-fines-20140930-10nz6z.html


 




 I'd have no problem with ticket inspectors handing out fines to fare evaders if they still had a system that made it, you know, possible to buy a fare.

I live near a large hotel, on a train line, that is three kilometres from the nearest 7/11. At least once a week, without fail, I see tourists standing at the tram stop looking worried. 

I'll often ask if they are OK and they ask where they can buy a ticket. I sigh and being to explain....

I put on 2 kilos in a fortnight (about five pounds) and so I started dieting but I just can't shift the weight. I also have a one year old daughter I look after most of the time which makes exercise hard (but not impossible)

Any hints or tips?

You get one chance to release a film, maybe two if the producers completely ruin the original work ala The Wicker Man.

http://gawker.com/5582644/all-the-terrible-things-mel-gibson-has-said-on-the-record 




 It means nothing that a celebrated actor is racist, homophobic, anti-semtic and violent? 




 He pled no contest to misdemeanour battery. So there's at least one person he hurt.

Polanski is scumbag and deserves prison.

Broderick was in a car accident 30 years ago. The family of the victim forgave him. Hardly the same thing.

I agree that Gibson was great to watch but he has ruined his own career. It is no one's fault but him.

 




 /s ?

 




 Repeating the things that actually happened and are on the official court records? 

Events that there are audio recordings of? 

The Gibson freely admits happened?
 




 Pictures of well dressed tall/fat/skinny/short/hunchback/neckless guys and why they look good.

 




 Portal 




 They forgave the first half-dozen fuck ups. But even Hollywod has limits. 

 




 Mel Gibson has show extraordinary hate and vitriol towards everyone from African-Americans to the gay community.
He threatened his wife and pled no contest to a  battery charge. He's an alcoholic, self-destructive, megalomaniac shit of a man. 

But sure, blame the Jews.

 




 In smaller communities, the scammers need to go undetected and run scams in which the victim is unaware they have been taken for a ride.

One of the criteria that con artists seek out is situations in which their victims are compelled to trust them. For example, older people are scammed more often than younger people not because they are gullible but, as you age and become more separated from your community, you need to trust others more.

A canny con man could very easily take advantage of the levels of trust that are necessarily built up in small communities. 

For example, if there is only one butcher in town, you're less likely to question the quality and source of his meat.

 I wrote an article a few years for a magazine about the Spanish prisoner and how it has evolved as technology has evolved.

 Just to be clear, we're talking about the twin raping his brother's wife. 




 The thread was actually about a weird anime where the actors were told to say whatever the hell they wanted.  









 Why would you kick a guy with gun?

  I found the pic, not the pudding pie. It's an old image.

Sad thing is, if I had them, I would have eaten them. 




 If you have to ask... 




  "Warning - Item Baby chicks ground alive might contain content that is not suitable for all ages."

Nope. Nope. Nope. 









 Think about it this way, you were the pioneer, you beat the tracks and built the roads of bad behaviour that your 14 year old brother is now the recipient of.

Every fight you had with your parents, every time they panicked because they had no one what they were doing, it was making your siblings life a little easier.

Don't be angry, be pleased you could make your parent and brother's live's easier in the future. 

You're the Johnny Appleseed of families.  




 They're fantastic films but none are ground breaking. 
  




 All great films! But none of those films are ground-breaking or exciting though.

Sixth sense is a classic premise done really well, Toy Story 2 is sequel and green mile is shawshank redemption with magic. 

Good solid films in a dull year.
 




 1999.

We had Fight Club, American Beauty and The Matrix but, while fantastic, none of those films are particularly ground breaking. 

The year was also packed full of films by filmmakers who had done better. Phantom Menace, Eyes Wide Shut, The Spy Who Shagged Me, Tarzan, The World Is Not Enough, Notting Hill....

1999 was a year for playing it safe, limping to end of the lackluster nineties.

Also, Wild Wild West.


 




 Too late! 

:( 




 Hitler himself.

 Aw thanks! 









 It's my wedding anniversary tomorrow. Thought I'd take my wife to see llamas. 

Chicks dig llamas. 
 




 They flowered a little last spring hence my interest in them. Only a few flowers.

A few bulbs snapped off so I'm trying my luck in the garden with the rest of my winter bulbs. (I'm in Australia and it's autumn) 




 Thanks! We found a half dozen of them when we moved into our new house. They've been sitting down the back of the garden for two years 




 They're dead right down to the roots. I can cut off the dead leaves but then I'm left with dead stalks right down low. 









 I'm performing in Guinea Pigs at Melbourne International Comedy Festival. 

We've had great crowds and great reviews (Here's one: http://www.melbartsfash.com/109918) until now but, on Tuesday night we've got the Herald Sun coming in.

For some reason, people actually read the Herald Sun reviews so we'd like to stack the deck with our kind of crowd. 

Check out the description below and, if it tickles you, hit me up in my inbox for a free double pass.

http://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2014/season/search?q=Jonestown submit=

EDIT: We had over fifty responses and all the tickets are gone! Thanks! However, please feel free to send me a message anyway in case we need to paper the room on any other nights. If you'd like to come on Tuesday night anyway, it is tight arse Tuesday and tickets are already super cheap.

EDIT 2: Thank you so much to everyone who came. We had a full house in the end which was fantastic. We even had two guide dogs in the front row. https://www.facebook.com/GuideDogZeke?fref=ts
 




 Yeah, not great.  




 Thanks. I like to keep in short because it grows so fast. When it gets just a little longer, I look really bald. Like here.

 A lot of great stuff on the IMDB triva page.

 Carrie Fisher was the original Miss Scarlet but was replaced at the last minute. 




 Nah, that's just what my head looks like :)  









 I've got to drive to Cheltenham tomorrow morning. I assume Punt going South is just as bad as Hoddle in the morning? 

Any ideas?

 We've used them a couple of times. They're great for sick kids as you don't wait long. 




 I can recommend this guy. He's very funny.  




 That's exactly what I thought.

 




 I know that both percent or per cent are correct but what about 'per centage'?

The in-house style guide insists on per cent.

Should I also use per centage? 

EDIT: Just to provide more context, this is in a piece of dialogue in a second novel. In the first book, the publisher used per cent. The word percentage did not occur.  




 Phew! I find going to the movies and seeing non-white people very uncomfortable. 

;)

The original story is set in Europe and draws from European history, politics, landscape and architecture.

The titans stride through cobblestone streets between Georgian houses and buildings, smashing churches. By making the characters Japanese, a lot of what made the series unique gets lost.

Do you think the film could suffer in the same way The Last Airbender suffered?




 




 It was tonight!

But we're doing another one Sunday at 4:30 on Northcote. 




 Getting your joke is the first time I've used my English major in years.  




 If you're free tomorrow night (Thursday) and love comedy that is half-baked and under-rehearsed, we'd love you to be in the audience for the test show of our sketch comedy show.

It is at 6:30 in Collingwood. 

Send me a message if you're keen!

Not cost at all, just your honest opinion.

 




 Downvoted for getting safety dance stuck in my head. 




 Jeremy is misunderstood. I've worked with him for years. 









 Fairfax, for the past few years, has been outsourcing a lot of their vital services overseas. http://www.crikey.com.au/2014/05/07/more-photographers-subeditors-to-go-in-new-fairfax-restructure/ 









 I agree, but viewership doesn't mean successful in the same way for Netflix as it does on network TV.

An original show offers Netflix prestige, publicity and air of quality that 20 year old repeats won't. 



 









 I got to Northside as well. I'm straight and have had nothing but great experiences.  




 Dammit. Why don't I read the comments before I watch these trailers?

 




 You'll probably be disturbed by the whole show then... 









 I have and continue to do so.

But I'm referring to a rapist who has managed to escape justice and who regrets his actions. 

If a person is truly remorseful, I would imagine they would want to make up for what they did.

 If I enjoy a pilot or first couple of episodes of a new series I'll often wait until the send of the season before I get hooked and binge watch it all. 




 There is also an Australian version of Wilfred if you're interested in seeing what else we've got. 

 




 Here's me being a killjoy...

 That's a pretty good send off I guess.

But Aubrey Plaza's send off for him was much better.

 'BROAD CITY!' he shouted 




 It is a web series but check out The Katering Show on YouTube. 




 Brooklyn 99 is getting better. It's progression reminds me a lot of Parks and Rec in the first two seasons. 




 When it first came out, a lot of reviewers missed the satire and thought it was a serious film. 

It is only in hindsight that people see the film for what it is.

He has similar problems with Robocop and Showgirls.   




 There's only one Scott Walker.

 Thanks! I'll give it a go.

 Consider me educated.  




 I don't think you're giving those woman or men enough credit. 

They're geeky but not hideous. Their stupid pillows are as creepy as all fuck.

 I'm building a Choose Your Own Adventure on twitter.

I've been told, if I set up new accounts that don't have a lot of followers and tweets straight away, I can run the risk of being deleted as spam.

I'm searching for some old accounts I can steal. Any ideas? 




 I don't believe you. 

You tried to take him down with a lollipop back in '04.

 My daughter's name is Beatrix. We told everyone it was after my grandmother, Beatrice.

I look forward to tell her the truth when she's older.  




 HOW DARE YOU! YOU LEAVE DAVID BOWIE ALONE!


oh, you meant the knife. 




 I'm in Australia and Starbucks failed here.

Our population is made up of a lot of european migrants who insisted on good coffee when they came here in the 50s and 60s. 

I have to admit I struggled to find coffee the way I like it in the US. I think Americans drink their coffee weaker than other countries, but drink more of it. 

I loved the jugs of drip coffee at the gas stations with the racks of syrups and creamers (I still don't know what that stuff is). 

 









 Congratulations!  




 Titantic is too manipulative to make me cry.  




 Life Is Beautiful fucking devastated me. Not in a way the pulled on my heartstrings either.

It left be ruined for weeks.   




 What you do like about it? 




 Its not popular?

 Do you think the horrors of Apartheid have been undone? 




 " after he kicked your ass in video games he probably had sex with your mom" - AmericanPsychout 




 What's great about his performance in Episodes is that while he is a prick, it's still a nuanced and interesting character. You end up feeling sorry for him.  




 In the Worlds before Monkey,
Primal chaos reigned, Heaven sought order.
But the Phoenix can fly only when its feathers are grown.
The four worlds formed again and yet again,
As endless aeons wheeled and passed.
Time and the pure essences of Heaven,
The moistures of the Earth,
And the powers of the Sun and the Moon
All worked upon a certain rock - old as Creation,
And it magically became fertile.
That first egg was named Thought,
Tathagata Buddha, the Father Buddha,
Said, 'With our thoughts we make the world.'
Elemantal forces caused the egg to hatch,
from it then came a stone Monkey.
The nature of Monkey was irrepressable! 




 I'm looking forward to him in Community. 




 The pears. Oh god, the pears. 




 I've never seen Bosom Buddies. That looks amazing. 




 My favourite has to be Renegade:

*He was a cop, and good at his job. But he committed the ultimate sinand testified against other cops gone bad. Cops that tried to kill him, but got the woman he loved instead. Framed for murder, now he prowls the badlands...an outlaw hunting outlaws...a bounty hunter...a RENEGADE.*

 At the time, Charlie Hebdo reprinted a lot of the Danish cartoons. Their offices were firebombed. 




 The people delivering packages are all contractors now. It's easier to just leave the card and not knock 




 That gingers have no souls? 




 Great film but probably not quite what I was after.

 




 Just checked out the trailer. Looks harrowing. 




 ooh! Nice one. I realised the other day that Nolan's films, with a few exceptions, are actually getting worse as he goes on but I never noticed because he set the bar so high at the start of his career. 




 So far, I can think of Cube, Saw, Oldboy, Exam, Captivity, Killing Room and Unknown.

Most in the genre are pretty terrible low budget efforts but I'm sure there is some gold out there like Cube. 




 I dunno. You're pretty far away from me and I find you REALLY annoying. 

Same goes for phones.
