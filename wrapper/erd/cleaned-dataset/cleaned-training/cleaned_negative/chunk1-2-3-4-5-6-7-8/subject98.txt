 From Wikipedia:

By 5 August the brigades of the Australian 2nd Division were exhausted and were to be relieved by the Australian 4th Division. While the relief was underway on the night of 56 August the Australians were subjected to an extreme bombardment, because the salient they occupied could be shelled by the Germans from all directions, including from Thiepval which lay to the rear. On the morning of 6 August a German counter-attack tried to approach the O.G. Lines but was met by machine gun fire and forced to dig in. The bombardment continued through the day, by the end of which most of the 2nd Division had been relieved. From its twelve days in the line, the division had suffered 6,848 casualties. At 4:00 a.m. on 7 August, shortly before dawn, the Germans launched their final counter-attack. On a front of 400 yards (370 m) they overran the thinly occupied O.G. Lines, catching most of the Australians in shelters in the old German dugouts and advanced towards Pozires. For the Australians, the crisis had arrived. At this moment, Lieutenant Albert Jacka, who had won the Victoria Cross at Gallipoli, emerged from a dugout where he and seven men of his platoon had been isolated, and charged the German line from the rear. His example inspired other Australians scattered across the plateau to join the action and a fierce, hand-to-hand fight developed. Jacka was badly wounded but as support arrived from the flanks, the Australians gained the advantage and most of the surviving Germans were captured. No more attempts to retake Pozires were made.

 Dad would never talk about the war. All he would ever say was "I did my duty". My Uncle told me about D-day. After my Dad died I found an Air Medal (with three Oak Leaves), but I have never been able to find out what he did. He never flew after the war, but worked for Lockheed for the rest of working life. Again, he was close-mouthed about work, but he was usually at a Lockheed facility in Palmdale.

There were boxes of photos from the war in the attic. Quite a few pics of paratroops loading up, long lines of C-47s.

He met my Mom in Orleans in 1944. Buts her's is another story.

In accomplishing her 100 missions Corsair 122 logged more than 400 hours flying time; her total hops, including tests and reconnaissance flights, reached an amazing 178. Built for air combat, Corsair 122 proved her versatility by accepting 1000 pound bombs slung from her belly and without strain or protest developed into the hottest dive bomber with wings. Were their blood in her fuel line instead of 100 octane she would be wearing the purple heart for the patch on the leading edge of her wing attesting of the accuracy of Jap antiaircraft fire. She has covered all the Jap bases in the Marshall Islands like the morning dew.

 Pyroclastic flows descend the south-eastern flank of Mayon Volcano, Philippines. Maximum height of the eruption column was 15 km above sea level, and volcanic ash fell within about 50 km toward the west. There were no casualties from the 1984 eruption because more than 73,000 people evacuated the danger zones as recommended by scientists of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.

 *Hell's Angels*, Howard Hughes, 1930. Even today the air combat scenes are among the most believable (alas 3 pilots and a mechanic were killed during the production). The explosions are real, unlike the flash and noise spectacles since. And Jean Harlow uses the line "wait here while I slip into something more comfortable" (she's wearing very little to begin with) for the first time. Because it's pre Hayes the dialog gets a bit spicey.

These motorcycles were popular for their high performance. Besides being hand built, with many optional performance modifications available, they came from the factory with documented dynamometer test results, allowing the new owner to see the horsepower produced."

These three kills, combined with two recorded previously, made them the Nay's first and only aces of the Vietnam War.

 Dad was just out of High School. He went to Lone Pine High School. After he graduated he helped build Manazar, where fellow Americans of Japanese descent were interned, while he waited until he was 18 to join up.

During the war there was rapid advancement  for many; I expect he was a [Direct Appointment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brevet_%28military%29#Modern_usage) (paragraph 2) 1LT.

 I'm American. If my French was better I could become a citizen of France anytime. My kids would like that because then they, too, could be French citizens. It's on my to do list. 




 Dad was very bright, and there was a great need for pilots is what I presume.

Edit: He joined the Army in April, 1942 at 18. He said "We weren't a bunch of four F'ers and joined up as soon as we were old enough." 




 Dad wouldn't talk about the war. All he would say about it was "I did my duty". After he died I found an Air Medal (Bronze Star) with a couple oak leaves. No luck finding out why he got them.

After the war he and Mom lived in Germany as part of the occupation but she hated it. He would never fly again but always loved aircraft and worked for Lockheed for the rest of his career. Again, he would never say what he did and was usually out in Palmdale.

Mom would never talk about the war, either. I believe they both went through some very bad stuff. She only went back home once, 50 years later, for a visit and it was utterly foreign to her, although she was proud of being French and never became an American citizen. Her Dad didn't survive the war and my Uncle was *Maquis* and is still living in a tiny French village, at 93, outside Orleans, where my Mom was born. He helped with communications, and still has homing pigeons.

 The best means to screen for colon cancer is a colonoscopy. Gastroenterologists usually perform the procedure, so the availability of specialty care may be a barrier.

All persons with a first degree relative (i.e. Mom, Dad, Brothers, Sisters)  with colon cancer are at increased risk and should have a colonoscopy every five years. The procedure is done with conscious sedation; one is not unconscious, but is unaware and cannot recall the procedure if the anesthesia is done properly. The most unpleasant part of the test is drinking stuff that makes you poop until the colon is cleaned out so the colon can be visualized.

Most colon cancer starts out as a small bump called a polyp that takes many years to become an invasive cancer so there is plenty of time to find them and remove them, thus preventing cancer. 

If one is not high risk screening should start in everyone at age 50 and be repeated every 10 years

 Basilone's Medal of Honor citation reads as follows:

The President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pride in presenting the 

MEDAL OF HONOR to
SERGEANT JOHN BASILONE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS

for service as set forth in the following CITATION:

Medal of Honour
For extraordinary heroism and conspicuous gallantry in action against enemy Japanese forces, above and beyond the call of duty, while serving with the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division in the Lunga Area, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, on 24 and 25 October 1942. While the enemy was hammering at the Marines' defensive positions, Sgt. BASILONE, in charge of 2 sections of heavy machine guns, fought valiantly to check the savage and determined assault. In a fierce frontal attack with the Japanese blasting his guns with grenades and mortar fire, one of Sgt. BASILONE'S sections, with its gun crews, was put out of action, leaving only 2 men able to carry on. Moving an extra gun into position, he placed it in action, then, under continual fire, repaired another and personally manned it, gallantly holding his line until replacements arrived. A little later, with ammunition critically low and the supply lines cut off, Sgt. BASILONE, at great risk of his life and in the face of continued enemy attack, battled his way through hostile lines with urgently needed shells for his gunners, thereby contributing in large measure to the virtual annihilation of a Japanese regiment. His great personal valor and courageous initiative were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.

For extraordinary heroism while serving as a Leader of a Machine-Gun Section, Company C, 1st Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation shortly after landing when his company's advance was held up by the concentrated fire of a heavily fortified Japanese blockhouse, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE boldly defied the smashing bombardment of heavy caliber fire to work his way around the flank and up to a position directly on top of the blockhouse and then, attacking with grenades and demolitions, single handedly destroyed the entire hostile strong point and its defending garrison. Consistently daring and aggressive as he fought his way over the battle-torn beach and up the sloping, gun-studded terraces toward Airfield Number 1, he repeatedly exposed himself to the blasting fury of exploding shells and later in the day coolly proceeded to the aid of a friendly tank which had been trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages, skillfully guiding the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite the overwhelming volume of hostile fire. In the forefront of the assault at all times, he pushed forward with dauntless courage and iron determination until, moving upon the edge of the airfield, he fell, instantly killed by a bursting mortar shell. Stouthearted and indomitable, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE, by his intrepid initiative, outstanding skill, and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of the fanatic opposition, contributed materially to the advance of his company during the early critical period of the assault, and his unwavering devotion to duty throughout the bitter conflict was an inspiration to his comrades and reflects the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.

 Now I know what (   ) means. 




 Codified law and collective governance were made practical, and there was rhetoric, theater, engineering and art. The standard of living even for slaves could be better than those across the Rhine, and a slave could become very wealthy, and free. 




 But that's not why the Romans were so successful. The lands the assimilated were Romanized, and those who lived there liked it. Remember Maximus in *Gladiator*? He was from Hispania. Eventually even Emperors came from former non Roman lands: Marcus Aurelius - Gaulish and Spanish. 




 Yes. They probably all "lost" by day 2. 




 Check with Mdecins Sans Frontires. They still have operations in Haiti. 




 It's hard to disagree. Certainly those single individuals had an enormous influence on so many lives throughout history, but the structure of modern society is so strongly shaped by Roman precedents. America's founders took as their model not some religious ideal, but a Roman one. Washington was the quintessential Patrician.

 Asylum is a place of refuge. We have far too few inpatient psych beds for long term care. The taxpayers don't want to pay for it. Too often the acutely ill board in emergency departments because there's no safe place to send them. Inhumane. 




 Down California you've got 101 and 1 on the coast, I-5  down the middle-if you like agriculture there's plenty here, and 395 east of the Sierra. I live in Olympia WA, my sister lives in Santa Cruz CA so I know them all well. Returned yesterday from a trip down the coast to San Luis Obispo, east to 395, then up the interior home again. 2800 miles, took a leisurely 7 days.

One of my favorite stretches is south of Eureka, cut over on 1 on the coast from 101 at Leggett. Very twisty, though forest then you can smell the sea and the ocean is before you. If you're staying in motels reserve ahead by midafternoon 'cause things fill up in the afternoon, but there are plenty of fantastic campgrounds, too.

 This one gets the oxytocin goin'

 I remember on rounds on the ID service in residency, 1980s so no EHR, the attending pointed out patient problems (change in wound, stool pattern, cognition  c) might first be documented in the nurses notes 2-3 days before they showed up in the physician progress notes. Now it's mostly templated fluff. 




 Exactly. Always sifting through the cut and paste to get to the narrative.

APSO format for progress notes is intended to lead with the narrative, but it often merely copies the problem list forward. I might get "Pt X tolerated diet and is working with PT", then the problem list.

I don't think the problem is inherent in the software. It's what the provider chooses to do with it that irks me. I would make one exception to this statement. The defense department's [AHLTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_Health_Longitudinal_Technology_Application). It is in its own world of uselessness.  




 One cannot help wonder what race relations would be like in America today if both these men were still alive. 




 Parrots, fuck yeah! 




 We have an EMR that goes to 2001, and scanned notes (which have consultant notes, study and pathology reports, and so on) so the story's there. Best are previously dictated H P, DC summary.

A physician is a detective, at least for hospital medicine. I cannot imagine how this would be accomplished in 15 minute appointments. 




 Probably not: these were likely *all male* groups, and also it would violate the sanctity of the right of the pizza peddler not to believe in evolution. 




 Now it's a real rivalry-so much more interesting. May they both stay strong for a great season! 




 Don't be superstitious. I'm more worried about Marquez. The longer you ride wild, the more the chance for a serious getoff. Doesn't he already hold the record for the fastest noninjury crash? 




 . . .  stuck in traffic. . .Heh 




 I've seen H Ps for pt admiited for elective joint replacement, written by the PA to satisfy hospital documentation requirements. All cut and paste, don't even describe the procedure.

On the other hand one of my cardiologist friends writes exemplary notes like yours. In this case the procedures, most recent ECHO, stress test  c are easy to find. He even provides references regarding the indications for devices or medications. A gold mine-not only are essential patient data provided, there's a bonus tutorial! Now if he'd only answer a page at night (a *very* sound sleeper). 




 There's the beginnings of a novel there, like Bukowski did for the Post Office 




 Your notes have far more free text than I usually see.  




 I've been using computers since the 1970s, and I love EPIC. I find great notes and crummy notes. Cut and paste as a portion of the note is very valuable, but as the whole note it's not. 




 I've been using Dragon for years, but not every work station has the software loaded. Many of my free texts notes are short and to the point anyhow:

Notified of AFib recurrence, rate 120s, asymptomatic. Systolic 120s. Will check electrolytes, bolus 10 IV dilt and continue to monitor

Hardly worth logging on to dragon for that. As for admit, consult, procedure, discharge, death notes  c I dictate, which uses speech to text, edited by transcription services, then sent to me for final edit. 




 When a patient has been in the hospital for a week and there is a crisis at night when cross cover needs to figure out what is going on the narrative of their hospital course is not optional. If I can't figure it out from the notes I must reconstruct it, which hardly is an advance in patient care. I'll take a pithy, short surgeon's note over the long empty templated progress note anytime. 




 I never ignore a page,  although there are times when there are many pages awaiting replies. I can only answer one at a time. Dictating an admit note takes 5 to 10 minutes; the expect page return time is 15 minutes. 

Texting is most useful with coworkers, such as "please staff this case with the housestaff', "pager switched to oncoming provider, no patients waiting",  c. 




 I am an employee of a multihospital nonprofit, and my collegues tell me I'm efficient. I'm quite satisfied with my job, and use texting all the time. To me it is not a net improvement, although it certainly has benefits. 




 My secret is exposed.  




 As a nocturnist I do principally admissions, consults and cross cover. I believe my admit note should provide the care team with a comprehensive and concise review of the past medical history. The history usually listed in EPIC and other similar EMRs is usually worthless. "Chronic airway obstruction, not elsewhere classified [496]" cannot replace "Severe steroid and oxygen dependent COPD with continued smoking". Nor can "Coronary atherosclerosis of unspecified type of vessel, native or graft [414.00]" replace "Coronary artery disease with 2-vessel bypass in 1999. Subsequent drug-eluting stents on dual antiplatelet therapy" 




 A very succinct comparison. 




 Not one of the 54 inpatient physicians in my department are satisfied by the current text vendor, Tiger Text. It is cumbersome and unreliable. The chief of heme/onc refuses to use one, and relies on a traditional pager. But he's a head of department and may do so. The rest of us put up with it.

I do not type well, and I text even more slowly. It is not  convenient in the least for me, and we have been using texting for seven years. 




 Most texts are the number to call, but some may describe a patient problem and suggest a remedy. These require a dialog, and it's faster for me to discuss the scenario than text. When busy I am getting multiple texts/dialogs, and so often when dictating, it seems, which is distracting. I will mute the ~~hated~~ helpful and necessary device when dictating. 




 I find your sources to be very weak support for your statements. My undergraduate work was in the neurosciences; the literature on behavioral health is, by necessity, inferential and firm conclusions are rare. I remain unpersuaded by the efficacy of accupuncture. I have worked in practices which included accupuncture practitioners, and have had an opportunity to listen to the rationale and review the literature.

Most of the early data on neurointerventional salvage therapy was proprietor sponsored and not reproducible. More recent data are more persuasive, but many await more studies.

I find "Simply sticking your fingers in your ears and ignoring new alternatives because they seem different to your tried and true methods" personally insulting and this adds nothing to your arguments. Let us be objective, please. 




 I am not adept with keying in text, and would rather have a spoken dialog, and these notes are mostly barren of the narrative of a patient's care. 




 The easy stuff is over.

May it be a labor of love for you as it is for most physicians. 




 I use electrolyte replacement by protocol routinely for ICU pts, excepting DKA, ESRD. These two I prefer a dialog with the ICU team. Often ICU nurses will write "verbal orders" anyway, which I find a day or two later in my in box. Mixed feelings about that.

When it's busy it can be vexing for the nurses and physicians to take the time for these mandatory phone calls regarding "critical" results that aren't.

 I use metoclopramide for two indications: 1) acute nausea and vomiting, and then as a second or third line agent (ondansetron is first) and 2) severe diabetic gastroparesis, and then only explaining the risk of irreversible tardive dyskinesia. There is no good treatment for the latter, as all agents exhibit tachyphylaxis.

I know of no data to support the assertion that metoclopramide has any effect on LES tone, and I have never seen it used for GERD. 

Tardive dyskinesia can be quite unpleasant. One patient said it even disturbed his sleep, and that sometimes he would bite his lip or tongue.

 Spotsylvania County, Va. May 10

Dear Father

This is my last letter to you. I went into battle this evening as courier for Genl. Heth. I have been struck by a piece of shell and my right shoulder is horribly mangled   I know death is inevitable. I am very weak but I write to you because I know you would be delighted to read a word from your dying son. I know death is near, that I will die far from home and friends of my early youth but I have friends here too who are kind to me. My friend Fairfax will write you at my request and give you the particulars of my death. My grave will be marked so that you may visit it if you desire to do so, but it is optionary with you whether you let my remains rest here or in Miss. I would like to rest in the grave yard with my dear mother and brothers but it's a matter of minor importance. Let us all try to reunite in heaven. I pray my God to forgive my sins and I feel that his promises are true that he will forgive me and save me. Give my love to all my friends. My strength fails me. My horse and my equipments will be left for you. Again, a long farewell to you. May we meet in heaven.

Your dying son,

J.R. Montgomery

 This is pure speculation on your part and appears to have no basis in reality.

It is not known how or why this avian influenza strain is spreading so rapidly:

"As a third U.S. state declared a state of emergency, scientists are scrambling to understand the H5N2 avian influenza virus that is ravaging poultry farms across the Midwest. At least 30 million birds in 12 states have been affected so far, either infected directly or scheduled to be culled, in the largest outbreak of a high-pathogenicity avian flu virus in the United States in decades. The new strain, which emerged in wild birds along the Pacific flyway several months ago, has not yet infected any humans, but researchers are puzzled by its path of transmission and other characteristics. An ambitious case-control study about to be launched by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the University of Minnesota, and the turkey industry may help answer these questions."

 Nigeria has no refineries, and has not paid its bills to the refiners-so the refiners quit supplying.

"The crisis began when oil suppliers, hit by tightened credit lines and unpaid interest, said the government owes them as much as $1 billion for fuel and subsidies going back to October 2014. They said they could no longer afford to supply fuel."

 Horsefeathers. Considering the time I road through Monument Valley with a 30 mph crosswind-visibility was impaired by sand and dust-the blast from my leafblower is pristine in comparison.

 I am a hospital physician and deal with death every day at work. I like to talk with cognitively intact 90 year olds 'cause they're time machines-a view to an era people born today  would find alien.

Sometimes I'll tell such a 90-plus year-old about [Jeanne Calment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Calment). If you ask some who's 92 if they'd like to live another 30 years they *invariably* say no.

I am an amateur geologist and astronomer, so my view of time is tempered by that, also. In geologic terms the entire duration of humanity's existence is but a hiccough in the big scheme. An if you reflect on the scale of the universe it's hard to make a big deal about your own life.

 When I was a kid (early '70s) most of the bikers I knew were-not very nice. The feelings of brotherhood so often espoused here were not so common then. Dentists definitely did not ride Harleys then.
