 I don't know much about it, it's a 2D game, something like mario, you can collect points, kill small minions and stuff. 

It's older game, so I can't remember the details.  




 Once again, thank you man so much, you made my day! :) 




 Do you think it's overhyped or it actually lived up to it's expectation. 

If you wanna check, I also made a video about it, and what I actually think about the game so far. 

Cheers!

 Is it just me, or particles are blury and not sharpened up? I have everything on high excluding triple buffering with 1920x1080 resolution and it's still 'blurry'. 

Is this due to game being made on source engine or me not being able to max it all out ( by maxing I mean triple buffering etc. ) ?

 I know it's luck based, but I saw so many people get such a good cards ( even myself ) when finishing arena with bad scores. 

What do you think about it?

 So, I just wanted to see other people opinions on E-books and do you use it often as way for reading, or do you avoid it unless you are unable to find it in physical copy. 

I find it hard reading books online, via computer/tablet or whatever device you are using. I  don't get the same feeling and it seems that I can't get into book enough for me to stay long. As for staying long, I also find it really difficult for me to read 20-50 or more pages on device rather than taking a book and chilling outside/sitting comfortable on your bed etc. 

So, how do you approach it, I know that physical copy of book can't really compare with e-book for many reasons, but what do you think about this overall? Are you comfortable to read a book on certain device as much as regular book? 

 




 So, I'm not a frequent 'book-reader' or however you want to call it, or should I say, I "wasn't", but nowdays, I'm more into books than anything else, and even tho I didn't read books what really interests me are mystery books. 

I just wanted to ask, since there are many suggestions for ones that love mystery ( like myself ) to go and read Harry Hole series, so I'm simply asking what do you guys think about it overall, what's the best book from that serial, is it smart to start from beginning ( even tho I will 100% skip first 2 books ( Bat and another one, can't remember now).

Sorry if this breaks somekind of rules, if it does, please notify me, I'll delete the thread, just wanted to see other people experience of this novel since there are some mixed feelings about it overall that I encountered. 

Thanks, and cheers! 




 Hey guys, I'm soon off on my vaication and I'm looking for good books. I recently started reading Da Vinci Code and I'm really into it ( I know I'm little too late for it, but better now than never :p ), so I'm looking for books that are similiar to this one, not in religious style, but books that are action packed, and that aren't full of description and stuff like that.
I didn't read a lot of books, and I'm starting to do it from this year ( 'new year resolution'), but I read few good ones, like Alchemist, Return and stuff like that, so I'm really newbie in this and looking for recommendation on good books.
Currently, I'm looking into Parfume book and Here to Stay: A Harrigan Family Novel from Catherine Anderson, so what do you guys think about these books, do you recommend them or whatso ever?
Thanks :)
TL;DR - to sum up, I LOVE MYSTERY, murders and investigations and stuff like that :p
EDIT: What do you guys think about book from Jo Nesbo, "Police: A Harry Hole Novel" ? 




 This is my deck, 2 images since it continues to bottom;

I have 0 legendaries, and I'm unable to craft any of them for now. Any suggestions on what I did wrong and how to improve? Thanks :)

PS: ( not that I'm implying that you need legendary to climb up, but lack of few of them is why I maybe inserted other 'not so needed' cards )

 So guys, don't know if there was thread for multiplayer, if not, this is great opportunity to talk about what you guys think overall, did it improve in any ways, or did it stay in the shadows of great singleplayer that AC series offer? What do you think? 

Also, if you are up to, check my thoughts of multiplayer overall; 


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KHXy2b00DY 









 So guys, it's been 'a while' since the game originally came out on PC, and as most of you know, it wasn't perfect in terms of optimization. Although some got it to work perfectly, others experienced stutters, frame drops, screen tearing and many problems with their gaming rig. So I figure most of you are already digged into the game a lot ( unless you're one of the unluckies to have problems with optimization ), but my question is, what do you think about it overall? Was it better than AC3? Was it worse? What are yours experiences? 

Also, I made a video and talked little about it, so if you feel like it, check it out. Also there's a potentional fix ( but I figure most of you know for it by now ( using d3overrider ), so yea. 

http://youtu.be/Pr-_03Btnk0

TL;DR: Worse than AC3? Better than AC3? In terms of optimization and what do you think about it overall? 

Cheers.

 Hello guys. My printer recently got out of ink, so I handed it over so they can refill my catridge. When I came back home to try it out, and put on the catridge, it's still red light on it, and it just blinks green for a merely second, then stands red solid. 

I have Xerox 3010/3040 printer, and I got the catridge refilled. 

I also have one question, is it normal for catridge to let down the ink, I mean, It's like there's a little hole or something and the ink is ( or powder) is slowly going out of the catridge. 

 




 As stated, I have tf2 keys to offer for AC Black Flag on uplay, or Watch Dogs. 

If there's anyone that can/want to do this, write in comments the amount of keys you want for it and I'll see what I can do about it! 




 Will trade multiple keys for either of the games!!!!  




 As stated, have tf2 keys, want Humble Origin Bundle BTA / Battlefield 3  




 Would prefer 'cheap' steam keys for above mentioned games. Name me your price and I'll see what we can do about it.  









 I'm NOT looking for games like Spelunky, or such, rather than the games like Batman, Assassin's Creed, Bioshock that has pure singleplayer campaign.

If someone has the above mentioned games ( AC3, FC3, Dishonored with DLCS and TOMB RAIDER!!), please put the price so I can know what I'm dealing with. 

Thank you! 




 Bring it on! 




 Is there anyone with similiar problem as mine, where I get disconnected from client or from the game( if I'm in the one)frequently ( every 5-10-15 minutes) and have to log back in everytime? 

What can be the problem? 









 So, is it usually like this that you get 1 quest per day? Or is there supposed to get bigger as you progress through the game regarding levels and such?  









 Hello. I have unusual Controller for PC, but untill I get my hands on XBOX 360 controller for PC i have to for now stick with this one. Is there any program that allows you to custom change your controlls to be able to play any game with that custom design.

 Hello guys. Just quick question about cables that are coming from PSU. I'm pretty newbie for these stuff, so I'm interested how to know which cable is supposed to go to harddrive, which one to DVD-ROM and such. I have 2 cables, and one is 6D, other is 8D, and the 6D was in my harddrive. What's the difference? 




 Hello guys. I recently purchased mine Sapphire HD 7850 card, and I wanted to see if anyone is experiencing same problem as me when trying to reedem the code. It says; 

"There was an error processing your submission, please check all values and try again. If the error persist please contact AMD Support at support@amd4u.com." 

 




 Hello guys. I'm not asking for any big help in particular, I just wanted if someone knows good site that you can learn about hardware stuff on it. What's the common one that's used widely, and that it has good reviews and tips. 

I already started reading on PCWORLD but I would love as many sites as possible. Thanks! :))

 So, apparently, while working on that mother quest, I end up having cops on my tail, and I can't get rid of them, wherever I go they start shooting at me because  I hacked that thing because I needed information about something. 

So, is there any possible way to interact with them so they stop shooting, or I just have to play all over again? :S 




 Thanks man once again, awesome funny game. 

All credits goes to this guy /u/bud369 




 As stated in title, while I do something, for a period of time, like watching movie, the laptop ocassionally and randomly turns black, but you can hear fans working, and there's still green light that's on too. it's like on sleep mode, but you can't wake it up or something. All I can do is turn it off, and turn it on again, but when I do that, it tends to happen again after short/long period ( long in terms of 1-2 hours, short in terms of 10 minutes ). 

It's about Toshiba laptop. Any help is appreciated, thank you!

 I would really appreciate someones generosity, if that someone could waste their time and a little money to give me Metro 2033. I'm asking only Metro, because i want to get it for my friend, as he is one of the biggest fans of games like Metro 2033, Bioshock or that. 

Anyway, thanks. 

Cheers!
 




 So, did anyone manage to handle this fps drop that appers at Boston. I played a game like 5-6 hours in a row, to sequence 6. When i came into Boston, there was a huge fps drop. Previous sequences, or places were apsolutely fine. 

I have HD5750 1GB, 8GB RAM, and X4 640 3.0 AMD Processor. 

I don't see a problem in my configuration, but the reason why i posted this, is to see, if anyone manage to solve this problem. It bothers me, because after passing 22% of game, i had to switch to Need For Speed Most Wanted, because i want to play AC3 at full experience. 

TL;DR - FPS Drop mainly in Boston, if anyone knows how to fix it, let me know! 




 I prefer batman AA, and would go all in for it. 

Cheers!

I'll give all of these things for Batman AA

I'm willing to give all of these for Batman.

 Yo guys, i just watched ocelote stream, and someone send ocelote a message, about candy panda, something me gusta and spanish shit' ( no offense ), and it was something SK ad carry, me gusta ad carry, something like that.

**How the 4pack splitting works** 

+ I will trade the 4 pack for the listed price + a collateral 
+ You activate the 4 pack and the game gets added to your library and 3 extra copies in your steam inventory 
+ You trade the extra 3 copies for your collateral back 


***Collateral will the cost to cover the price of the full 2/3/4pack***     

*If you have a good steamtrades account / blue+ sgsflair , the collateral wont be needed*    



**Price for 4pack splitting**    

(Note: I value ToD as - 3 ref)

**How to check whether you are eligible for unpacking a 4pack**

First and Foremost, You MUST NOT own the game in your library  
Second, Follow these steps

+ Go to the steam store mainpage.
+ Add any game into your cart
+ Select Purchase as a gift

 Is there active PES 2013 community or is it better to wait for 2015 to come out? Not really a huge fan of 2014. 




 So, I'm staying on a vaication for a while where I don't have acces to internet on my PC. I have internet on mobile, and I'm wondering will my steam offline mode on PC brake if I login on steam on my mobile?

 I'm new to this game and I can't seem to understand how to attack with your troops other troops that came via sea. I'm fighting during third mission "We will endure" and it's so hard to attack ( don't know how), while in the meantime, I don't even have baracks built.

 




 As stated, please don't lowball and please for the love of God don't offer me Dead Island Epidemic. 









 Is there active community on PC now and should I get Fifa 14 now, or just wait for the Fifa 15? 

Is there overall active PC community regarding FIFA ? 




 So in a few days, I'm going on a long vaication where I won't have access to internet on my PC for a while. ( 1-2 months at the most ). 

So, regardin steam and its offline mode, how does it works, does it have any limits on how long can I use it? Is it restricted in any sort? 

And what happens with achivements and playhours?

 I've never been able to access steam market since I never bought anything from steam store/market itself.
My question is, if I buy steam card now, and activate it, will I be able to use market without any kinds of restrictions considering buying/selling on market, or will I have somekind of cooldown before I'm able to do that?

Thanks and cheers. 









 AS stated. 




 Have Surgeon Simulator 2013 Booster pack + 1 ref TF2



**Want only these 2 WALKING Dead S1 Cards ;

No time Left   Starved for help 




 AS stated, in the title, looking for strictly these 2 items. 




 What's the price then in $/? 




 Title. 




 Offer below. 




 I just want to ask, if a person revokes CSGO keyes I got "as a gift" ( i payed via bank transanction, but on steam, it looks like a gift when you trade blank keys for nothing ), can I ask for a refund, or something, can I get those keyes back? 

How does it work? 




 S3 finished as GOLD IV, have around 90 champions and around 30 skins. If you are merely interested, contact me, I'll give you more informations. Account wasn't banned a single time and I'm willing to use middle-man for our trade. Already made around 20 trades on reddit.com/r/sgswap. EUW ACCOUNT!
For more information regarding which skins do I have, and overall the information on account itself, PM me or post a comment below.
Please don't offer me separate origin/steam/uplay or whatsoever accounts as I would like to keep my games on a single account.

I accept keyes, offer whatever you think would be acceptable offer,  without lowballing, please.

Cheers! 














 Offer basically anything, that's around same price, or whatever you think it would be a good deal.  









 I'm new at this stuff, hence why I'm asking. Sorry if this is forbidden. 




 Title? 

Do you usually read a book, then follow it with a movie, or vice versa? 

Is Headhunters good book, and what's the movie like for those who watched it?  




 Mostly these 2 games, for personal use only. 

Prices?

Send it here, I want CS GO key that can open case, preferable winter offensive case key, but, feel free to send me an offer via this link above. 

 




 Are there enough people to play FIFA 14 on PC, online and stuff like that? 









 I think I'm almost done with the game, and I'm packed up with potions ( full of everything ) have 300+ gold left, and I came to the point where I had to check if my difficulty didn't lower it self while I was playing. 

The game is really great, I love it so far, but I feel that it could've been more challenging. 

What do you think about it? 




 pls, I'm very confused 




 My current specs are following: 

CPU; AMD ATHLON II X4 640 @ 3.00GHz QuadCore

Memory; 8GB RAM DDR3 1333MHz "Kingston"PC10666 CL9

Harddrive; 500GB Sata

Graphic card; ATi RADEON Sapphire HD7850 1GB GDDR5

Motherboard: FOXCONN A78AX 3.0

I want to upgrade my processor ( + motherboard since this one doesn't support AM3+ ) so, what do you think I should get with this configuration with around 300$? 

I'm playing on 1920x1080.

Should I get an SSD too?

 




 What's the Length of the game with and without side-quests? 




 Is there any video to show how good this game is and why is it actually good game? 

I mean how to make someone love the game if you know what I mean.

This is my currently build, and I'm afraid to buy Dayz thinking it wouldn't perform properly due to bad optimisations. 

Should this be enough to run the game without a hitch?

And I kinda want the game so leaving for a bit until they potentionally fix the optimisation is kinda not an option, since they may up the price a little bit then and stuff like that ...

 This is the second time I install/reinstall it, and it won't even show beginning logos/start the game/go into the options menu unless I open steam overlay. 

This is really weird, I have the game on steam already, and I can't get past this. 

I have X4 640 3.0 quad core, and not dual core CPUs that experience problems

Anyone knows what's the deal?

 So I'm doing a task on computer tehnology, and hardwer in particular, and I was wondering ( since I'm not that experienced ) if there's someone who would help me with the progress of hardwer through history, what changed and whatnot. 

CPU,GPU, anything related to that and it's progress would be helpful. Thank you all

 I need someone to do me a facebook cover, profile picture, and maybe 1-2 things aswell. 

You can post here, then add me and we can discuss everything there, from what I want, to the price that the graphic designer wants. 

And would be nice if you could include previous acts of your work on this subject, thanks. 

EDIT: I had in mind something like [this](http://pokit.org/get/img/4a3c3844d4e2212a44ee99efc73f9630.jpg), with different text etc. 




 please post your offers here.

 The transaction went through and it's completed, but they are still holding my money as a pending balance. 

How long does it take for it to completely transfer and clear out ( for it to go over "available balance"), since I've been waiting 24h and they are still holding it? 




 I have: 

Orion Dino Horde = Giftable Copy 

Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet = key

Tower of Gunns = key 

cards/tods/ref

Looking for **Jazzpunk** and **The Novelist**

Post here your steam url if you want to disscuss. 




 Tell me here if you are interested, gonna go to sleep now, will check it tomorrow: 

post your steamprofile links please aswell 

Cheers

 Current Status = ONLINE

**PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE READ the text below. I know it's a pain in the arse, but it's mandatory for you to have certain requirments in order to open packs**

Payday 2 splitting = 1 key


Don't Starve + DLC splitting = 1.5 key (0.5 = 1 TOD or 4 ref, **I can give change if necessary)


Just write here, then proceed to add me. **Have a LOT of 4packs, don't hesitate :P**

**How the 4pack splitting works** 

+ I will trade the 4 pack for the listed price + a collateral 
+ You activate the 4 pack and the game gets added to your library and 3 extra copies in your steam inventory 
+ You trade the extra 3 copies for your collateral back 


***Collateral will the cost to cover the price of the full 2/3/4pack***     

*If you have a good steamtrades account / blue+ sgsflair , the collateral wont be needed*    



**Price for 4pack splitting**    

(Note: I value ToD as - 3 ref)

**How to check whether you are eligible for unpacking a 4pack**

First and Foremost, You MUST NOT own the game in your library  
Second, Follow these steps

+ Go to the steam store mainpage.
+ Add any game into your cart
+ Select Purchase as a gift

Your steam account is not eligible to open a 4pack if the page looks like this - http://i.imgur.com/nXTCSbt.jpg     
Normal Steam account with good standing will be directed to a page like this - http://i.imgur.com/odUbPpE.jpg

**How the 4pack splitting works** 

+ I will trade the 4 pack for the listed price + a collateral 
+ You activate the 4 pack and the game gets added to your library and 3 extra copies in your steam inventory 
+ You trade the extra 3 copies for your collateral back 


***Collateral will the cost to cover the price of the full 2/3/4pack***     

*If you have a good steamtrades account / blue+ sgsflair , the collateral wont be needed*    



**Price for 4pack splitting**    

(Note: I value ToD as - 4 ref)

**How to check whether you are eligible for unpacking a 4pack**

First and Foremost, You MUST NOT own the game in your library  
Second, Follow these steps

+ Go to the steam store mainpage.
+ Add any game into your cart
+ Select Purchase as a gift

Your steam account is not eligible to open a 4pack if the page looks like this - http://i.imgur.com/nXTCSbt.jpg

 16-11, thanks fnatic for mini hearth-attack thanks thanks thanks  




 15-11, come on fnatic, 1 more !!!!!!! 




 fnatic choking :(((  




 the comeback is real boys :D 




 that's not the proper way of troll, you can't say RiP skins and then hope for NiP win. There's no hope after you say RiP 




 13-5 currently, NiP can still comeback 




 Just asking, fingers crossed man, hopefully we got it :D 




 neither you are sheep. You are worm 




 why do you say RiP then? If it goes to map 5, Nip have huge chance of winning it 




 Have you ever heard of  a phrase "A lion does not concern himself with the opinion of a sheep" ? 




 16-13 :D 




 sorry 




 nice JW, 4k, hopefully you redeem yourself for that previous performance  




 no. 




 exactly that, what happend is on 3:0, fnatic won the round, it was 3:1, and f0rest still had $10k to spare :D 

amazing buff volverino 




 TAKE MY FUCKING ENERGY FNATICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC 




 how much did you bet man? 




 OP? You are calling $10k lead within first 3 rounds op? fuck that bro, smgs are weak, pls volvo buff them /s 




 kill f0rest and you win pistol round ... 




 NiP will do it too :S 




 yes 




 no OT 




 nop 




 16-13, close game :D 




 rip energy 




 as I said man, gg 




 it is now. 13-6 




 alright, on to the next map I guess. cobble was fnatic pick, right? 




 Krimz 4k last round of the half not enough for 8:7. now if fnatic takes pistol, we have a game underway 




 pistol round will be crucial I'm afraid 




 I'm scared for my bet now ... NiP magic is ON 




 they lost 5v3, wow ..... 




 silver D: 




 nip seem on point man ... 




 4v2, that was nice 




 NiP seem really on point ... get_right is on fire as well 




 same here man! 




 good luck to you and me my friend :) 




   _ FNATIC TAKE MY ENERGY   _ 
 




   _ FNATIC TAKE MY ENERGY   _ 
 




 let's goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo 




 exactly my thoughts, I hope for interesting game and I hope fnatic will prevail :D 




   _ FNATIC TAKE MY ENERGY   _ 
 




 wen't 10$ on fnatic, let's see what they got. 

edit: love how some fuckers are salty and downvote my every single post :D hahaaha

 




 yea, trust random guy from the interweb!!! 




 reddit is betting on fnatic :S this can't be good  




 hahhahahahahahahhhahhahahahahaha, I lost 0.50$ but FUCK YOU LDLC, YOU SUCK! HAHA 




 low to medium means nothing because I don't know what's your low and medium bet :P 




 how much are you going to bet? 




 you gonna switch? are we both gonna dip in bro? 




 I'm judging them from game that's currently ongoing 




 lol what?

gl all 




 I'm expecting easy carry from dizzy 




 who says NiP won't tryhard? you're throwing your opinions out 




 nice oddsway 




 Ar3syK carried so hard, not even funny :S 




 you know what's left in this world? HOPE 

HOPE!!! 




 how much did you bet? :S 




 game not over yet 




 the choke is real, streamline are demolishing them :D 




 lol, streamline is going to win the game, destiny and ustilo are carrying hard :D 




 as someone here said, Ar3syK is carrying so hard, and he's making the difference 




  changed my bet and doubled it.

proof? 




 pic or it didn't happen :) 




 **we must go back!**  




 very good odds for NiP at this point. 

fnatic seem to be in a slump now 




 hahahahahahahahaha 




 we love you guissssssssssssssssssssssssssssss 




 Thanks for finding pinnacle of the problem. Good job! 




 and you are mad because of that? Holy fucking balls dude, you gotta lay off a bit and learn to filter that kind of shit. I don't know why are you acting like you are 30 years old, when you are clearly in range of 10-17, with a brain of a toddler 




 yes 




 ok :D you seem mad tho, try to calm down mate 




 maybe I should've typed "/s" :( 




 atleast 2k+ on each player, and they dont' buy kits :D 

hahahaha gg wp, tsm got this 




 really **FUCKING** annoying 




 ah, he reminds you of Varys most likely. That's what I thought. 




 which GoT character? :D 




 16:14 




 I think TSM will take this, or at least they'll take cobble :D 




 Come on Virtus pro, you can take this home!

 Looking for STEAM copies. 

Please post here, then feel free to add me. 

And don't offer me the standard prices for either game, if you can offer cheaper, I'd appreciate that greatly :) 

PS. Accepting keys for Cities Skylines, but not for Rogue ( since Rogue keys are mostly uplay ones, and I want it on steamerino)

Thanks

with code KPMN32-6VRM69-6INRND 

Willing to use tf2/csgo keys, offer me the price 




 I heard after finishing third season, I'll be good to go? 

Is that true, does the story continue based off the TV Show or? 

Thanks, I know this question has been asked a lot of times, but I want a certain answer. Cheers

 they got rekt 16-12 vs TSM at CPH games :) 

not their best map definitely 




 dumb bettors? 




 As commentators said, cadiaN didn't even have time to prepare with TSM. The fact that he's raping VP so far is mind-blowing. 

Sometimes, betting is a weird thing 




 please someone cheer me up and tell me that Na'Vi are completely out of the tournament ... 




 he told me I was cancer multiple times ... what a joke this guy is ...

  ST FN deagle Conspiracy

not bad, thanks for the answer, cheers 




 which skins did pasha give to olof? 




 I'm tempted to drop 25$ "bomb" and hope for the best.  




 14-9 currently, come on DIG, 2 more boys and you got it!!! 




 come on dig, close it out please, don't fail this one ffs 




 zacrem is the guy that talks out of his ass basically 




 he's been using that since the first map, good job on noticing it 10 minutes ago 




 1 tour of duty ticket + loads of cards for Human Revolution deus ex? 




 Can you do human revolution for 1 tod + loads of cards? 




 added to talk about human revolutionized
 









 human revolution price? Can't find it in spreadsheet 




 lol, you sure? :D 




 exactly my thought. the problem is, upgrading CPU means also upgrading motherboard, because I use old Foxconn AM3 motherboard, and if I want a beastly CPU, I'd have to get a new motherboard also. 

So I think that the best solution might be selling off this PC and buying completely new one. 




 haha nice! I have this boy rocking for more than 4-5 years now :P 




 you and me bro, this is it. I'm pretty happy how long this rig of mine lasted, and how much it endured through the years. I just need one last push, and that's it.  




 Based off system req., yes, have to wait and see how the port will turn out to be.  




 I hope so, if the port is good 




 I hope I can run it on Athlon X4 640 3.0 and HD 7850 1GB with 8 gigs of RAM. Old, but pull me through this one and I'll be forever in your debt my sweet rig. 

 




 Placed a tiny bet on fnatic. 

If they win, I'll get a nice $$ out of it, and if they lose, well fuck it, atleast I won't see these fuckers on that LAN, so that's nice. I don't like fnatic anyway. 




 oh, so oddswaying? :D got it :D 




 You are literally brainless. Get off my dick kid 




 lol, 14-2 to 16-14, that was butt clencherino so mucherino, ffs  




 that comeback tho, 15-14, 1 more na'vi and ez! 




 OT incoming! 




 did you bet on NiP? If so, you'll be disappointed I'm afraid :( 




 svetloga being stupid yet again, no surprise there. 




 Flipside are choking, Na'Vi may pull this one off 




 Answering your own question in a single post. Damn ... 




 people are just mad that they lost their bets. ofc they won't blame na'vi for running 0 strats mid game as T's, and 0 smokes... 




 lol, chill out kid 




 Well, looks like I'll have to buy a new PC now. Mine 5-6 years old AMD 640 won't hold anymore

 talk to me when you grow up  




 ah, so no campaign like Dead Space 3? :((  




 At least my logic is up to par ;)

 Placed bet on flipside, but it still isn't over boys, until it says that flipside has won the whole GAME, you can't count VP out 




 is it possible to play coop on DS1 and DS2? 




 wow ...

 Since it's 313 rubles for Broken Age, can you do 3 Chroma keys for Broken age? + sack of gems, so essentially, 3.5 keys 




 boring boring chelsea 




 and Luis 




 Seems like you didn't read my first comment at all. You just saw "I'm happy they scored" and that's it. 

Read it again, and see what I said. 

"I hope this urges Mourinho to change Drogba and mix it up a bit," 




 But we have conceded? I don't get your point.  




 I love how people who have no idea about Chelsea and it's squad talk like they are Mourinho's assistans. 

Solanke would've been better 10x times than Drogba, but he's not even on the bench.  




 Exactly my thinking ... 




 We would've played like shit through the 2nd half too, hadn't they scored at the end of the 1st one. Better sooner than later. 




 To be honest, we've been really bad, it's mostly Leicester playing  




 I'm so happy that they scored, we've been shit whole game, well deserved! 

I hope this urges Mourinho to change Drogba and mix it up a bit, this won't end up well if it keeps going like this with the same set up 




 not really, unless you are willing to overpay, in that case, feel free to add me to discuss

 given that it wasn't a yellow for diving, you're right :) 




 he would've went out with the ball 100% 




 100% 




 Well obviously, if you think that it's a faul it's not a yellow ... 




 :( 




 It's arguable, but I firmly believe that it wasn't a penalty. Definitely not a yellow card tho, that's for sure 




 So you'd say that handball wasn't a penalty? 




 you should've mention it then :) 




 Yup, barely ripped his head off, just barely 




 passing, sorry 




 yes, nice putting 




 It's funny for me :D 




 Exactly. That's not a penalty 10000%. But it wasn't a card either 




 Have YOU actually been watching? 




 LOL gtfo 




 funny how you mention bias, LOL 

guess who's really biased? :) 




 Okay, that was not a penalty, but fucking booked???? IS HE FUCKING BLIND? there was clearly a contact 




 it wasn't an offside tho, that's the thing :) 




 no he wasn't

 hahaha, that photoshop, hahahahah 




 If I decide to overlock it at some point, would Hyper 212 be enough? Sorry for bothering mate, thanks for answering my questions :) 




 alright, thanks for the insight, so to sum it up, i5 4690k is one of the BEST CPU's on the market currently, based off price/performance ratio?  




 Are there any  AMD CPU's out there that can compare head-to-head with 4690k? 

4690k is 240 in my area, so that's within my price range. 




 Thanks, I checked my store, and they have Gainward GTX 970 Phantom Edition there as well as normal Gainward GTX 970. (although they probably can order parts and I can get different model of GTX 970 ).

There are different models, would you say (since you put it in your build) that Zotac model is the best? 

And that i5 4460 is exact same price as FX-8350 in my store. Would you argue that FX-8350 is better in that build or no?  




 Sapphire Tri X is 50 cheaper here than Asus MATRIX model. 

So CPU is actually alright? There's no need for i7 4790k or something like that? 

Would you argue that FX-8350 is better than i5 4690k ? Obviously i5 4690k is better but if I was to buy FX-8350, how much worse would it be and would my CPU bottleneck r9 290x / gtx 970? 




 This is a c/p from pcpartpicker: 

https://pcpartpicker.com/guide/DyKH99/great-gaming-build#comments


Seems like a great build, but since it's around 200 more expensive here in my area, I'm interested if this build ( with maybe switching R9 290x with gtx970 ) would be future proof for around 3-4 years, or even 5, while playing at 1080p, 60+ FPS? 

How loud is r9 290x and is it better to purchase GTX 970 or R9 290x? 

Thanks guys, I'm really newbie when it comes to these kind of things 




 THEY still haven't fixed the bug with blank games in invetories. fucking volvo

 Not even a yellow hehehe :D 




 gotta apsorb that salt 




 meanwhile, your team can't beat Reading. sad times really 




 3 




 that was close huh 




 that's a 3rd handball so far mate :R 




 GIVE US SOLANKE MOURINHO YOU PIECE OF COACH 




 Wait, how is that NOT a faul for Drogba? SHAW got the faul for the EXACT same thing??????  




 Drogba can't keep up with the pace of this game. 

Mourinho please give us Solanke 




 go away 




 foul yup, yellow - I don't think so 




 what? hazard just hit the post ... are you sure you're watching the game? 




 a lot of people on r/soccer would argue that was a faul unfortunately 




 LET'S GOOOOOOOO 




 inc downvotes :( 




  some gift images won't show up for some reason.

bug for most of the people :/ 

still not resolved  




 I couldn't believe it too mate. 7850 1GB with 8 gigs of ram, 1080p. although lowest settings for GTA, it's 1080p ... 

I could also run Shadow of Mordor on medium settings, 1080p, 45+ fps constantly :p 


 




 been great so far, I can't complain :)) 

700 for a PC old 5+ years that can run GTA on 1080p with solid 50+ FPS is more than I can ask, honestly :) 

 




 thanks /u/ilovegames4life, thanks a bunch man ... 

 




 Thank you, I feel relieved. :) 




 My hardware is really old, and I'm probably upgrading in a few months. 

System requirements are really low, and based off them, I might be able to run the game easily on medium settings, with fluid FPS. 

Thanks tho 




 I'm rocking AMD Athlon X4 640 3.0, 7850 1GB, and 8 gigs of RAM. 

Based off that, I can run this game, but is it well optimised? I wasn't able to enter the beta and see for myself unfortunately. :/

 I don't see any discussions regarding matches? NAR vs Complexity for example 









 TI4 HYPE 




 how did you find this? Is it only Sven or what?

edit: why is AM showing up 2 times?? 




 so they are coming out tomorrow, ^^right?

right?


RIGHT!?!?! 




  nless you mean the forums, but honestly prediction forums are always full of no

prediction forums? 

can you link me please? I meant dota2lounge subreddit tho, there's a forum??? 




 before update? What update? 




 nice rant, I'm a fan 




 who won first game? Wings or EP? 




 Yes, you are the only one, courier's been out for 3 days since we had hit that stretch goal 




 Title.

dotabetting is dead, dota2betting is private, dota2lounge is dead, anything else? 

Any other sites where people post their insight and such? 




 yea, right... 




 where? 




 where is CDEC an underdog? definitely not on dota2lounge 




 then it's bettor, not better 




 BETTER QUESTION IS: WHEN??? 




 THIS HAS TO BE ANSWERED PLSSSS 




 YOU SHUT YOUR WHORE MOUTH 




 so soon??? 

IN VALVE TIME OR BLIZZARD TIME OR WHAT MAN???

WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS??? 




 you can change it still even tho it says it's 'locked' 




 c/p

Basically, I have to rely on mouz and ehome getting 1st place, rest I pretty much fucked up.
Wings got through instead of HyperGloryTeam, and NA is just a big fuck up overall anyway.
I doubt they'll implement anything like you suggested. (I'd be more than happy if they do) 




 DON'T CALL ME ANXIOUS, I'M NOT ANXIOUS I'M JUST A BIT STRESSED OUT OK????? 




  the end of waiting is near!

LIAR 




 no way man, SHUT UP, SHUT THE FUCK UP DON'T DO THIS TO ME 




 why? it won't happen :) 




 Nope, I bet they'll publish immortals after the qualifiers end. 

If they get out a patch tomorrow with immortals and courrier, I'll gift 1 compendium to a random person here.

 :D 




 Immortals are done, polishing is not but smoke and mirrors, they are just waiting for hype to go up or something, whatever, volvo is weird 




 Each time you copy and paste this, someone dies, stop fucking doing this. 




 I hope that was sarcasm. Otherwise, you are pretty fucking dumb yo 




 because volvo is fucking with us

^^^kappa 




 how come 0%? not even 1%?

 What kind of fucking post is this? Game 1 isn't even over, dafuq? 

'Team Wings are doing it!' 

What the actual fuck dude? 




 nothing I think, unless you correctly predict which team will be 1st, that's 50 points. 




 Yes, but that reverse fucked me up, and now I have VoidBoys, NAR and NOTTODAY advancing and being in top4 which is impossible :( 




 I just need HyperGloryTeam to win vs Wings, and CDEC to win/draw vs Wings and I'll correctly predict top 4. 

Odds of that happening? 

Ugh... 




 While we are at it, did anyone pick Root gaming but the game ended up switching to Void Boys because of the bug and vice versa?  




 Better question is: Why do we have to wait THIS LONG to get cosmetic items? 




 Ehome won 2-0 over EP, which automatically puts them on first place. EHOME can either lose/win/draw their last game, the outcome won't matter. They are first. 




 Prepare your cats! 




 wasn't the game almost closing out? why did they ask so late on it? 




 Why did they want to remake the game? 




 Why did they want to remake the game? 




 why? 




 nop 




 65 levels? how come?

So basically, it's the same thing as buying straight up levels?  




 Since I already have lvl 90 compendium, will purchasing lvl 50 one give me 50 more levels + all default rewards that you get for buying compendium? 

Or will I get only +50 levels and rewards for reaching level 100-105 etc.

 exactly. I don't wanna hope. It won't happen. Gaben will disappoint me
 




 I don't wanna hope. It won't happen. Gaben will disappoint me 




 You don't understand, I won't fault you for that, but please educate yourself in business 101. 

Making a chest, or anything for that matter, will get INTO THE GAME EVENTUALLY, how come you don't fucking understand that? 

You think that if they make something, and they don't hit that goal, they'll just throw that shit away? Are you fucking mental? IT'LL GET INTO THE GAME EVENTUALLY. 

Do you not understand basic logic? 




  to unlock them then their work would've been for nothing 

**nothing**? 

alright, I'm done, peace 




 how about you stop being fucking fanboy and realise that a company such as valve should have had this item prepared long time ago. How about you also use your fucking brain and understand that creating game content of great quality doesn't take 10 months to create? Huh? How about you fucking do that? 
 




 there shouldn't be any 'polish' bullshit, we reached our goal, how about they fullfil their 'promise'? 




 how to get the flame/red one?  




 Anyone picked Void Boys instead of Root gaming by mistake in predictions? 

Valve picks were bugged, so instead of picking Void boys, the picture would show Root gaming and vice versa?  




 did you get 30 points like a drop that occurs occasionally after the game or ? 




 you got 30 compendium points by watching on twitch or ingame? did it drop after the game or midway?

 that bait 




  #stillgreen 




 I feel like adding orange and pink would be a great idea.  




 I wouldn't know, I'm waiting for a whole pack to go on sale
 




 only first episode :/ 




 http://steamcommunity.com/id/train_subject9972/inventory/#753_1

Something from my inventory? 




 will think about it and let you know 




 what 




 Cheapest price please, offer below. 




 No problem, I hope you'll enjoy it! 




 My review of the game: 

This game is what Murdered: Soul Suspect could've been and even more if it had focused on improving its mechanism and graphics. 

As a person who expected a lot from Murdered being the fan of the genre itself, I really thought there's nothing else these type of games can improve on. And I'm delighted and happy to say that this game proved me wrong. Not only does this game is stunningly gorgeous in any possible way, it also has that creepy atmosphere that makes you really think about every process you make and things you do in the game. 

"This game doesn't hold your hand" - is damn right, and I love how it isn't completely linear. You can explore and find cases however you like, there's no really a perfect order or the right order for that matter. You will end up doing the same thing in the end, and the fact that it's kinda "open world" with few limitations here and there is one of the pros of this game. 

For this price range, I'm not sure if a game that's around 4-5+ hours long could satisfy everyones needs, unless you are a fan of detective   mystery games such as myself, but I would definitely consider picking this up as soon as it hits your optimal price range. 

Score: 7/10 




 That's nice. 10x tf2 keys at current price is 19.40. 

Killing Floor 2 is 19.99, which is the cheapest amount if you compare it to other ROW regions. 

9x chroma 2 keys at current bring it to about 19.08. 

Good luck finding it for 10x TF2 keys / 9x CSGO keys, I'm sure there are plenty of people around selling for that price and willing to lose some money. :D

 




 Killing Floor 2 - 10 CSGO chroma 2 keys 




 oh, alright, thanks for the answer 




 who's the other GK? 




 unforgettable?

 I drink a lot of energy drinks but I'm not that fat. Are they really THAT bad for your health? 




 lol? 




 I have Athlon X4 640 3.0 and 7850 1GB with 8 gigs of RAM. I'm eager to upgrade, and it'll have to be really soon. 




 Same here, I was thinking about buying that same combo with maybe r9 290x instead of GTX970, but I'm curious if I should actually wait or what?  




 So basically, I need help with my build. I was thinking of upgrading my PC from Athlon II X4 640 3.0 and 7850 1GB to something more beastly, capable of running nowdays games on high/ultra settings. 

My first questions: 

**Should I wait for next generation of CPUs by AMD or even INTEL later in the year?** 

If I wait, I'll have to endure till the end of the year with this PC that barely runs most of the games nowdays. If I buy a PC however, **will it be somewhat timeproof?**. 

Lastly, what would be my optimal pick for PC build? Considering I'm about to buy parts from my country, and it's mad expensive, I have around 1000 to spend. 

Given that here, GTX 970 and i5 4690k are 650, what would be the best bang for my buck? 

Maybe R9 290 Tripple X or something? 

What would you guys recommend overall? I plan on having this computer for at least 3-4 years, will that be possible with this amount of money?

Please help, and sorry for wall of text! 

TL;DR Read everything marked with **black**. 




 Never said I don't like chanting about other team's players. I said I don't like teasing of Stevie G particularly.  




   he has his few uses

^^LOL 




 wait, so to be loyal, I have to really dislike Stevie G.? Are you fucking retarded dude or what? 




 That defending was even worse than when JT scored. 




 You judge me if i'm a real fan based of liking Stevie G. or not? I asked you before, and I'll ask you again, are you retarded? 




 What's funny? 




 I don't like all this teasing of Steven Gerrard. He's a good player, he didn't deserve it. 




 doesn't mean anything? I heard it's pretty important for Liverpool  




 Terry never won a Champions League? 




 Come on HR I believe in you! 




 I'll pass, thanks 




 C. 

Is the outcome different if you pick different options? 




 I've beaten 3 games in the previous week. 

**Ryse Son of Rome** - Great game, a bit repetitive,and a bit too short, but I enjoyed it overall, cool story and a fun experience. 

**GTA V** - Nothing to say about, a little bit disappointed with the end (maybe it was my fault in the end), but the story, voice acting, characters and everything was so detailed, I really got myself into it and I started caring for every single character. Loved it, fantastic example on how triple A should be made.

**Perils of Man** - Short, but interesting adventure game, with interesting thoughtful story. Although a little bit buggy, if you manage to overcome its flaws, you can really enjoy what it has to offer. 

Currently playing: 

**Ori and the Blind Forest** - nothing much to say about this game, best $20 spent in a long long time. Fantastic game, with fantastic gameplay mechanics and graphics that  will leave you completely speechless. Must buy in my opinion!
