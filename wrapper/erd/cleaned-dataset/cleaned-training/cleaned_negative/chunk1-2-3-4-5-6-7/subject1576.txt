 We have found our new Michelle Bachmann. 




 Let's get back in the saddle and pedal forward.   




 Good for you, /u/elzmuda -- there are always excuses to drink, but if you make the decision first thing in the morning not to drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad, if you doggedly persist in the commitment, then alcohol is not an option.  I like to say that after I decide that I am not going to drink TODAY--alcohol is out of my movie for the day, all day.  




 Lady Lindsey is the last closeted gay male in politics. 









 Unfortunately, it was a widely-held belief that the alcoholic was immoral--if only he would take "the pledge" or "get religion."  The failure to make the choice not to drink was seen as sin.  It really wasn't until the late 19th century (Rush, Trotter 1760-1832) that a practical "disease model" and treatment emerged (Keely) although it was not widely known or accepted.  The modern recovery  movement begins as a radical reaction to the WCTU and the moral choice models--fully accepting the disease model of alcoholism.  Frankly, the anti-AA ideologues are actually preaching a moral choice model--without the moral-ism.   









 Many times, these sorts of local heroes become honored judges and courthouses are named after them. 
























 Of course, I've been there in my own special and painful way.  Most of us get where you're coming from and we want to provide support along the way. 




 Yeah, I remember that neuro-feedback loop when I was drinking.  When I went back to "moderate drinking" after 15 continuous years of sobriety I thought of course that I could sip fine wines.  I'd buy these $100+ bottles of aged port and I'd have the appropriate crystal glasses.  Of course, being an alcoholic, I'd hide all of my apparatus in crawl spaces and wait till everyone else in the house was asleep and pull out my port and sip my wine--inevitable waking up at 5 AM laying on the floor with empty bottles of port that I must have swilled down.  Did I need any more proof of my powerlessness?  And yet, I went on and on for 7 long hellish years. 




 Fine chocolates. 









 Like EVERYTIME. 




 In a discussion sometime last year, I told my pal, /u/offtherocks, about the great 19th Century English novelist Anthony Trollope who in 1858 published [Doctor Thorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Thorne) which deals with the multiple episodes in the lives of recurring characters in something called the Barchester Chronicles.  If you are at all interested in literature, I can't recommend them highly enough.  In *Doctor Thorne* the title character treats the alcoholism of his friend Sir Roger Scatcherd who eventually dies from the disease.  

 But be this as it may, be it true or false that Sir Roger was most efficacious when in his cups, there can be no doubt that he could not wallow for a week in brandy, six or seven times every year, without in a great measure injuring, and permanently injuring, the outward man. Whatever immediate effect such symposiums might have on the inner mindsymposiums indeed they were not; posiums I will call them, if I may be allowed; for in latter life, when he drank heavily, he drank alonehowever little for evil, or however much for good the working of his brain might be affected, his body suffered greatly. It was not that he became feeble or emaciated, old-looking or inactive, that his hand shook, or that his eye was watery; but that in the moments of his intemperance his life was often not worth a day's purchase. The frame which God had given to him was powerful beyond the power of ordinary men; powerful to act in spite of these violent perturbations; powerful to repress and conquer the qualms and headaches and inward sicknesses to which the votaries of Bacchus are ordinarily subject; but this power was not without its limit. If encroached on too far, it would break and fall and come asunder, and then the strong man would at once become a corpse.  p.124

And here, Scatcherd on his death bed describing his fears relating to the effect of the disease upon his heir, Louis:

 "With my poor boy; with Louis."

 "If he [Louis] will let me, I will [look after him,]" said the doctor.

 "And, doctor, when you see a glass at his mouth, dash it down; thrust it down, though you thrust out the teeth with it. When you see that, Thorne, tell him of his fathertell him what his father might have been but for that; tell him how his father died like a beast, because he could not keep himself from drink."

 These, reader, were the last words spoken by Sir Roger Scatcherd. As he uttered them he rose up in bed with the same vehemence which he had shown on the former evening. But in the very act of doing so he was again struck by paralysis, and before nine on the following morning all was over.

In the characters and story of Doctor Thorne and Sir Roger Scatcherd I was struck at how sophisticated Trollope's 1858 understanding of the psychology of the alcoholism and the sufferer's powerlessness over the malady.  Also the powerlessness of that caring physician to help his friend. 






































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 When I got sober in 2009 after a 7 year relapse, as I saw it, I had the choice of killing myself and avoiding what was certain to be professional disgrace and a criminal prosecution over unfiled and unpaid federal income taxes or get sober and face the music.  In the years of my relapse the income from my professional practice was on a roller coaster.  Some years, I barely made any income and in at least one of those years I made a million dollars.  The unpaid and unfilled taxes were an abyss that I could not figure out how to address despite numerous false starts--of course, not being in recovery I had intentionally walked away from ready and willing help and support.  Finally I was at "fuck it, I'll just sit here and drink."  

Ultimately I suffered very serious professional and criminal consequences that included federal prison time. Some of the damages to my reputation and professional status (I lost my license) were permanent, but the criminal consequence has been long in my rear view mirror.  

When you own taxes in the US you might find that you owe reasonably $300,000 dollars and then through some black magic the IRS says your $300,000 indebtedness is now $600,000 and then time passes, even with payments and forfeitures, the IRS says you now owe $900,000 which is sort of where I find myself now.  In other words, my sole criminal offense resulting in a short prison sentence has become a life sentence as it relates to intractable debt and IRS collection activities including garnishments and seizures.  

When the collections nightmares first got underway the local agent that I dealt with suggested that I file something called an Offer In Compromise (OIC).  An OIC is a whole lot more than calling the IRS up and saying--here's a few thousand send me a release,  In 2012 I undertook the process and I was very close to accomplishing a deal when mysteriously (a common experience when dealing with the IRS) the rug was ripped out from underneath me. 

Leaving out lots and lots of the details, I determined to find out why.  I submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and I got my entire IRS file.  As a result I learned that the former criminal investigator in my underlying criminal case supplied misinformation which if I had had an opportunity to address I would have been able to supply documentation refuting allegations he made that disqualified me.  

Flash forward, to now, I just completed all the hoops, and I am greelighted to submit a new OIC (now complete) which my accountant believes stands a chance of success based on revised rules adopted by the IRS in 2014.  Also my employer is supplying funds to effect a deal if it can be done.

I write about this to let you know that I too struggle with life on life's terms and I don't drink TODAY no matter how frustrating, confusing, depressing, anxious painful or embarrassing those terms are.  I doggedly persist every day that I am SOBER which means, I still stand a chance.  Five years sober and I am still working on clearing away the wreckage of my past.  

tl;dr  CC has bad, bad tax problems; he doesn't drink; he overcomes obstacles; and, he hope that he may finally be able to clear away financial wreckage of the past.

Note: This was painful to write, but I promised to update a comment about my resolution and determination to deal with this issue. 















































































































































































































































































































































































































 The [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) is a post that I published in several versions.  It's made up of information that helped me stop drinking and get sober + ideas suggested from among others, /u/offtherocks.  My pal, /u/Flow_Morpheous_Flow noticed a typo so with the need to make that slight revision I added a link to the daily check-in, too.  

So if you're **new here** I hope you will consider making the [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) and [the Daily Check-in](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/checkin) part of your Stop Drinking routine. 







































 Here on the westside of Cleveland we have been in this wet weather loop for some days.  So the ground is saturated and where I live close to the edge of Lake Erie our storm sewers backed up and flooded our basement about 7:30 PM last night.  My son was temporarily residing down there and a lot of his belongings are lost.  Quick action saved it from being worse; but it's been stressful as I dealt with work, my son, the disaster clean up folks, the insurance company and the SO.  The pice de rsistance was when I jumped into the ice-cold shower at 5 AM because the flood knocked out the water heater.  I was able to successfully re-light the water heater before I went to SBUX to hang with the dude. 

So somewhat stressful day, but all in all it has worked out so far.  It worked out and I even got a bike ride in, met with some people on a work matter, and hung out on some on Reddit.  Compare and contrast with 6 years ago.  I would have absolutely exploded at the situation, resentfully responded to my poor family and probably sulked in my room sneak drinking.  Yikes.  

I am so glad I did not drink TODAY. 




 Welcome /u/TZ840 to /r/stopdrinking -- yeah, I wouldn't worry about telling anybody for awhile unless it's smart because you want to keep booze out of the residence, e.g. the GF drinks.  So at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I hope something there will help you with "next steps."

Good luck and welcome aboard the lifeboat. 




 Congratulations, my friend on showing us that it can be done.  An invite to join us on /r/dinos will shortly follow in your inbox.  









 Good work, keep doing what you're doing. 




 Welcome /u/sarmst12 to r/stopdrinking.  When I stopped drinking I was fortunate enough to run into a friend of mine at an AA meeting and he sketched out the [some of the ideas that became the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which gave me sufficient directions that enabled me to stop drinking and to get sober.  Now, I have shared them with you.

Good luck.

 Yeah, it's a total bummer.  I got up this morning to take a shower--ice cold water.  The basement flood extinguished the water heater.  A quick cold shower and I was able to re-light the water heater for the SO's shower so I got that going for me.  I meet the disaster clean-up people at 9 AM.   









 Great news!  Keep doing what you're doing. 







































 I'm curious, why? The knighthood? 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; even if my basement flooded over night.  Oh noooooooo... 




 Great link. Thanks! 




 My agnostic AA meeting and our brief AA readings are highly supportive of belief and non-belief.  We do not bash religious belief.  Also, having said that there is one character who goes off (like the guy you called) while most of us just roll our eyes.  In my experience of having been the secretary and chair of many AA meetings over the years and  bearing in mind that usually the secretary is deemed by the membership to be the "sickest" person-- leadership do NOT govern meetings, they are there to serve.  

BTW, here's an AA [position paper to professionals on our many paths.](http://www.aa.org/newsletters/en_US/f-13_winter09.pdf)

Edits:  Yikes, I'm still not sure the above makes any damn sense, once again confirming that I should not try to comment before my first cup of coffee in the morning. 




 Welcome /u/purplepurple77 to /r/stopdrinking -- at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) The post describes what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I'm pretty sure that it's a pretty good place to start the process of stopping.  Let me know.

And good luck to you. 




 [My **Saturday Share** is at this link. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25u6cc/saturday_share_im_train_subject1576_and_i_am_an_alcoholic/)

By the way, I doubt that I will ever drink again; but even now I haven't "quit drinking," instead I make a renewable decision every morning that I am not going to drink TODAY.  In other words, I stopped drinking one day at a time.  That works pretty well for me.  It works much better than all those sober years ago when I told myself that I had permanently "quit drinking." 




 BTW, there is no SD limit on how many posts or comments you can make a  day ; ) 




 Good job, /u/Shawder11 -- progress, not perfection, but you did that perfectly.   




 Congratulations my friend, an invite to join us in the Dino-den will follow shortly in your inbox! 




 My friend /u/1literCC -- this gets increasingly astonishing.  I am so proud of you.  Whenever you hear that little voice, refer to this post.  113.86 gallons of alcohol not processed by your stomach, kidneys, liver, pancreas, bowel, bladder, and most importantly your brain.  Welcome back to life. 




 I'm not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad--in solidarity with you. 




 Thanks, I'll delete.
 









 I totally resembled that thinking process; until I stopped drinking and until I learned that sustained time stopped changed all of that into a process that looks something like this (sorry no pie graft):

Get up!  Make a decision not to drink TODAY.  Memorialize the decision by logging into the morning Check-in.  Do the simple things on my list for the day: coffee with friends read the New York Times; work, household chores, personal errands, recovery meetings;  improve my life.  Go to bed SOBER.  Repeat.  

The result is that my life when from ruination of health, wealth and reputation to a mainly happy, free and valued SOBER life. 




  Even now, writing this, part of me is ashamed and embarrassed that I would pray, but hey, it works for me.

Please, don't ever be embarrassed by this.  I am astounded by your courage in posting this.  I am positive there are many, many SDers who feel the same way you do and don't have the courage to admit it on the Sub.  Listen, my friend, many times I've been asked about my morning ritual and while it is true that I am a real agnostic and sometimes atheist--my re-written 3rd Step prayer is what I slide out of my bed and say every morning.  It works for me.  And before I go to bed at night I repeat it in gratitude for my sober day. 




 Here's where I was at 25 days in recovery: my wife was having an affair with her then (sociopath law partner); my daughter who was a high-school senior was newly pregnant; my son was trying out his gay-period as a high-school sophomore; and I would be going to federal prison for tax evasion.  In short we were living the whole dysfunctional American dream. 

Flash forward nearly 6 years: my wife and I fully reconciled (yeah, 27 year marriages are complex); my legal troubles are behind me (Orange is the New Black is my new fav Netflix series); my 41/2 year old grandson Riley is the light of my life; and, my son is knocking down theater awards including a rave review in today's paper for his "hilarious" performance as the Nazi playwright in the Producers.  

I'm sure what I'm saying is obvious: don't drink and life is one hell of an interesting adventure.  Even my feelings of betrayal and my broken heart healed with time.  Good luck to you. 




 Well if that's the binary, it's a no-brainer.  I'd trust HRC with IT, and not trust Rubio with making nominations to lifetime federal judge-ships, especially the Supreme Court. 




 Racheal Dolezal followed this advice and see how well it worked out for her?  




 True story: many years ago I had a client who was killed after being crushed by a casting at a steel factory when an overloaded crane collapsed.  Should have been a no-brainer workers' compensation death claim but on autopsy the pathology report noted 12 nanograms of THC.  The claim was disallowed because--my man was presumptively high.  I hired the leading expert in that era on the subject of THC intox who testified that he and other scientists tried to arrive at a scale of THC intox based on the blood-alcohol model and had utterly failed.  He indicated that there is no means of objectively measuring impairment from THC based on presence in the bloodstream.  I won my case.  Frankly, this should not have been an issue since my deceased worker was not involved in any operational respect as it related to the casting or crane that killed him, but why let a little logic get involved in depriving a widow of death benefits.  

 














 Welcome /u/SuckMyKaHawk to r/stopdrinking.  I hope you feel free to fall right in.  Check out the daily check-in post.  Oh, and here's the [link to the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck. 



















 Or your tie knot.   




 Yep 
























 I've been to lots of AA meetings over almost 30 years; and, I've been to a few crazy meetings, too.  Usually, I need to stay attuned to "the winners."   There are always two types of examples in recovery: good examples and bad example, but even the bad examples can be good examples if you know how to unpack the meaning.  ; ) 














 Imagine if the media covered alcoholism for the public health crisis that it is--it would make the horror over Aids and Ebola pale in comparison.

Thanks for the link! 




  I can't help but think that AA is doing me more harm than good, I do suffer from depression and AA seems to amplify that due to some of the self defeating and negative attitudes that go on in the room. I feel like I need self empowerment not self depreciation which I feel like is what some AA members preach.

I've never been to a meeting like this, let alone several meetings so that I felt that a pattern was emerging.  I have been in dark or depressed places where I had the reverse of rose-colored glasses on; and, I processed what I saw and what I heard in a way that lead me to believe as you seem to believe and which you ascribe as an AA message.  

But by all means, try a SMART recovery meeting!  I give you a lot of credit for persisting in seeking help.  Good luck.

 Congratulations on 300 days; in 2 months I look forward to adding you to r/dinos! 














 Also check out the Morning Check-in; it's how a lot of us ritually memorialize our decision not to drink TODAY.   




 So as outrageous and racist as this is--how is this not Free Speech? 


































 Yes, I did the [the Baby Steps, at this link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) The Baby Steps are the things I did and do to stop drinking and to get sober.  Good luck.  I hope you get traction and join us on the SOBER journey. 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; in soggy Cleveland I still believe: Go CAVS! 




 If you're not feeling well please call a doctor.  Otherwise hang in there, personally I have been there. 




 Welcome out of lurk, /u/runinjagal. Please keep posting as you go along. 




 I did the things I describe [at this link to a post called the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I still do these things TODAY.   




 We talk about this, but probably not enough.  I honestly can't think of a time in my drinking where I was happy with only one or two drinks or beers.  In fact given the choice during most of my drinking career between one drink or beer and not drinking at all--I'd usually not drink at all.  A single drink or two would simply set off cravings, make me uncomfortable, and make me more likely to flee a social situation to "feed my disease."  Personally a funny fact: I met my wife the night I was sitting at an upscale bar doing the crossword puzzle and drinking a diet coke.  I was "pacing" for that evening's drinking; it was far too early in the evening to do the kind of drinking I would end up doing that night.   




 That is totally on topic as evident from the responses.  Income inequality it the animating issue of both the Clinton and the Sanders candidacies.  




 I can say in hindsight, jumping into AA meetings helped me enormously with all of that.  Again, just my personal experience.  




 The political argument is about income inequality.  Of course, your comment is one of the arguments being made. 
























 P-e-r-f-e-c-t! 




 Well-done /u/mac_question it sounds to me like you're in the right place.  Let me share the [Baby Steps post with you](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is a description of what I did to stop drinking and get sober.  Maybe some of the ideas there will be helpful to you too.  Good luck. 









 Congratulations, my friend! 




  Right now I am just thinking "I will never drink again." but then questioning that, because I've said that so many times.

If I were thinking that way I'd be lost too.  But I don't think that way at all.  In fact despite 2000+ days of continuous sobriety I still do it one day at a time.  At this [link to a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) I explain exactly what I did.

Good luck on finding yourself.  If you stay on this sub, I'll bet you anything that you will begin to find yourself.

 I'm so glad you're here, /u/hhhlo -- you are part of the whole. 




 REO Speedwagon and fans frozen in time circa 1978; but, sagely singing:

 Good for you; hang tough.  It's worth it.  

Listen, if this were easy there would be no alcoholism.  Heavy or abusive drinkers would stop or moderate--end of story.  Instead we lose hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide directly to this disease.  If ebola did this to our populations we would be in a worldwide medical emergency and we'd recognize the seriousness of what we are grappling with in terms of a health crisis.

Here's what I can say from my personal experience: active alcoholism was killing me; and, sobriety is a beautiful alternative ALTHOUGH in the early days of sobriety it often doesn't feel that way.  It took time for my body and brain to recover and worse I continued to believe that I was missing out on the party.  That latter piece of the puzzle is particularly dark--because that message is my old alkie thinking in the throes of trying to send me back into my disorder.  My answer: don't drink TODAY and trust the experience of others that its well worth the struggle because it is. 




 As a long time AA, I would encourage you to definitely make the effort to get to one of those agnostic/atheist meetings.  Perhaps you will find the person you think will be an ideal sponsor at one of those meetings.  In the interim I would for sure use the phone numbers and ask the same question you ask in this post to your friends.  Finally, pro-tip--when you connect with a running crowd of like-believers or non-believers you may well find a set of meetings that closely align with your belief or non-belief that are not advertised as agnostic/atheist meetings.  And, as you go along feel free to ask for help among your friends to start an agnostic/atheist meeting.  




 I quit smoking cigarettes 23 years ago using willpower.  I lost 60 pounds using will power.  I trained and ran a marathon using will power.  But I could not recover from alcoholism through willpower.  I needed a power outside of myself.  I found that power outside myself in the fellowship of other people in recovery.  I accessed information about my underlying problems; I received explicit directions to address my issues connected with recovery; I was supported in success and failure; despairing I had phone numbers to call; I found positive social activities that did not involve my former drinking milieu; I found a road map through the chaos of my pass; I discovered a way to objectively check my condition and progress; and, I found a purpose for my life.  None of these things were available to me via my self-will or willpower.  These directions came from outside.   




 Big lie. 




 Perhaps you misunderstand my comment on what I call the 4 goals or purpose of recovery (actually paraphrasing The Natural History of Alcoholism, at p. 365 Vaillant, Harvard University Press 1995).  Officially, AA does not have 4 goals.   In fact AA's official "primary purpose" is stated succinctly in the "Preamble" which is to stay sober and help other alcoholics.   





























 After I make my morning decision that I am not going to drink TODAY, alcohol is not in my movie.  This idea, this belief, this personal reality means other people's drinking has NOTHING to do with me.   




 In my experience true RECOVERY was not possible without help from outside myself. 




 ...or you create your own agnostic meeting and discover how quickly you attract fellow agnostic participants.   









 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping Sunday SOBER all day, here in Cleveland! 




 What I'd try to do is remember that alcoholism is a well-recognized medical disease and TRY to treat my in-law with compassion.  More than even that I would remember that as an active alcoholic in the immediate past I personally was no prize to my wife and children.  Out of respect for my immediate family, I would practice love and tolerance of my troubled in-law during his brief stay.  

Most importantly for myself, I would continue to make the daily decision not to drink TODAY, doggedly persist, and above all remember that it is One Day at a Time.

Best of luck with this tough situation. 




  alcoholism is a disease of the spirit.

This is so true.  Well said, my friend. 














 How dare you tell us what's moral or not moral!  Who do you think you are?!! 














 Two things: 

1. I posted this in /r/law and /r/badlawyer yesterday; 

2. /r/politics deletes many of my links for myriad stupid reasons including my link to an article this morning where Scott Walker was called a liar by the British Prime Minister over false claims Walker made about President Obama.  "Off-topic."  A link to the endorsement of Rick Perry by the American Sniper widow was deleted as off-topic.  It's gotten to a point where most mods no longer bother to respond to my objections or inquiries.  The deletions are indefensible under their own rules. 




 In the US, our Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 better known as HIPAA is similarly implicated, but the right to recover for a breach of confidentiality would not survive the decedent.  It's interesting, I'm dealing with a family of a gentleman who died of lung cancer and the Cleveland Clinic is making access to the decedent's medical records nearly impossible even for the surviving widow, again because of HIPAA.   




 I honestly believe that those of us who KNOW for ourselves that we are alcoholic and that we should get help--have already taken the first 3 steps the day we walk through the doors of our first AA meeting.  I think that it's useful, though, to get a sponsor and "work through" every step with the sponsor even 1-3 at a pace most comfortable for you and the sponsor.  The "clean up steps" 4-9 are best addressed systematically over the course of the first and possibly second years.  I posted earlier in the week about a difficult financial amends with the IRS that I'm working on and I'm just a couple of months shy of 6 years if that gives you any idea of how these can take time.  Finally, all this work is about creating a blueprint for living your authentic life and helping others.  So 10, 11, and 12 are all about that aspect of your new life. 









 The issue with human remains is fairly settled in most states (and to be clear, state not federal law governs this question).  The human corpse and its attendant organs are supposed to be the PROPERTY of the decedent's estate and thus belong to the executor or next of kin.  But the disposition of the body otherwise--i.e. the pathology, tissue donation, or errors in switching corpses have not successfully given rise to lawsuits.  

Frankly, I'm the OP of this link and an attorney and I mostly find the story interesting from the standpoint that nearly every aspect of "personhood" creates rights and remedies and this slightly ghoulish example was a colorful but not terribly important situation except to illustrate that outrage does not mean actionable lawsuit. 




  I an so sick of the GOP claiming they are the ones who represent Vets 

As a US Army veteran of the Viet Nam era, I totally agree. 




 A couple of years ago I got into this discussion using the lifeboat metaphor.  For me, if I were drowning and I was thrown a lifeline about to be pulled aboard a lifeboat I KNOW I wouldn't question the belief system of my rescuers, but that's what we alcoholics seem to do  reflexively.  Of course, AA language has ingrained references to God and prayer--but the real solution in AA is built on 4 simple ideas:

1. Give the alcoholic a substitute for the dependence on booze;

2. Remind the alcoholic RITUALLY that even one drink will lead to pain and relapse;

3. Repair the social and medical damage that was done;

4. Restore self-esteem.

That is the point and the purpose of the 12 Steps.  AA is the simplest and most accessible model for achieving these 4 simple ideas IN MY EXPERIENCE.  BTW, I believe SMART Recovery and Rational Recovery are designed to do the same 4 things.  





























 Get a shop vac! 




 I was at my home group Thursday night and after listening to the prayers and mentions of God, I made sure I said--if your new here (we always have new people at this meeting) you do not need to believe in God, or a higher power, or prayer.  You are welcome here.  No one will look down on you over your belief or non-belief.  

I hope that you will remember to do likewise when you feel strong enough and included-enough in your meetings to make sure the newcomers hear that message--the message of inclusion.  The only requirement for membership in AA is a desire to stop drinking and I'm personally glad you are giving it a shot.  Now having said all that -- I needed to get over myself and the notion that my objections to religious belief were an obstacle to my getting sober when in reality MY ego was my biggest obstacle.

Good luck. 




 Nice!  sniff  Nice! 




 Yes!  Social anxiety is a fairly normal part of early recovery.  Can you think of any reasons why apart from your individual psychological make up?  It's actually pretty simple if you think about it.  When we do drugs and alcohol we are intentionally cutting ourselves off from engagement with others.  Often we isolate in order to do whatever our drug or drugs of choice are--undisturbed by family, friends or acquaintances.  Now that we're sober we do the whole social thing without the aid of chemicals--it's like learning how to ride a bicycle in public without training wheels.  But guess what?  Training wheels are available at the closest AA meeting.  It's how I successfully reintegrated.  Don't be afraid to speak up--we want you to open your mouth and tell us your experience!  Someone in the room may need to hear what you have to say. 




 Welcome /u/Germain_Goldchain to r/stopdrinking.  You may already have come across [this link to the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  These are the simple next steps to start stopping for many of us.  Good luck to you. 




 Welcome /u/wannabechefjojo to r/stopdrinking--so [at this link is the post known on the sub as the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out simple "next actions" we can take to stop drinking and to get sober.  I did these things and the Baby Steps are a daily part of my life.  Best of luck to you. 




 I did AA.  I met a bunch of lunatics that I began hanging with.  We did  golf, softball, bowling, meals, dating, and everything I thought I was doing when I drank.   




 Heck, /u/fear2111 -- I thought you were going to ask a hard one!  So at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which describes in detail how I stopped drinking and how I got sober.  Now let me be specific about getting away from beer.  When I make my conscious daily decision not to drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad, alcohol is out of my movie for the day, all day. This includes beer.  But let's go one baby step further--I need new friends, new situations and new activities BECAUSE I need to extinguish the old reinforcers--my beered-up buddies, bar rooms, and drinking activities.  For me this mean recovery, and AA was the easiest, most accessible route to recovery.  In doing this I needed to get rid of my preconceptions about what this might involve and dive in.  I did and it worked for me. 




 [Source.](http://www.aaagnostics.org/agnostic12steps.html) 




 I created a stand alone post with the Agnostic 12 Steps.   




 The Agnostic 12 Steps:

1. We admitted we were powerless over alcoholthat our lives had become unmanageable.

2. Came to believe and to accept that we needed strengths beyond our awareness and resources to restore us to sanity.

3. Made a decision to entrust our will and our lives to the care of the collective wisdom and resources of those who have searched before us.

4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.

5. Admitted to ourselves without reservation, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.

6. Were ready to accept help in letting go of all our defects of character.

7. With humility and openness sought to eliminate our shortcomings.

8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.

9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.

10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.

11. Sought through meditation to improve our spiritual awareness and our understanding of the AA way of life and to discover the power to carry out that way of life.

12. Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs. 




 Stunning post, Sam.  You do have way more than booze and drunken conversation--you have a blueprint, a road map for a whole new way of life.   




 90 degrees yesterday!  Raining cats and dogs this morning and cool.   









 Or "W." 









 Here's one of the coolest things about sobriety--you get to discover what is your new normal.  

You're very smart to seek as much support at this stage of the journey because **in early sobriety we need to extinguish the old reinforcers of drinking friends, drinking venues, and drinking activities.**  That is why successful recovery is almost always a journey of fellowship.   





























 Welcome /u/MuiLaV to /r/stopdrinking -- I found it useful not to think of myself "quitting drinking" which implies permanently changing my habits.  Instead I stop drinking TODAY, only, and I can renew this commitment, daily if I choose.  But, let me give you MY broader blueprint: [it is at a separate post called the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  The Baby Steps are what I did to stop drinking and to get SOBER. Good luck. 




 I will not drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm doing rainy Saturday in Cleveland SOBER, all day. 




 This is very insightful for someone at 6 days!  Good for you.  

I think it's a pretty common experience in recovery that at some early point--if we are sincere--we find that we have become new people.  We start to live with a new purpose to become who we thought we might be. We become interested in passions and interests that we dreamed we do someday if we could ever get off the bar stool or out of the club.  

It's all out there, keep doing what you're doing. 




 Weekends were never my problem, drinking was.  If I make a daily decision that I am not going to drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad--alcohol is out of my movie for the day, no matter what day it is.  The fellowship of other sober pals is my reinforcement. My commitment to myself and to my sober friends is all that I need. Good luck. 




 Congratulations, /u/royalobi!  So, this whole getting SOBER thing is working out for you? 





























 truth hurts 



















 And a BIG THANKS to u/chinstrap for another great week of Check-ins!  Who's doing Next week's Check-in? 
























 I'm not anti-second amendment, I'm anti-perversion of 2d amendment to defend individual gun violence as some sort of God-given right of man.  It' ain't. 




  You're not getting my point. I never said you were wrong, I said you were too biased.

That's like saying "I didn't call you an asshole, I said you were an anus."  The ignorance is in this weird and phony historic-isms to manufacture neutral meaning for a racist symbol.  It's like arguing the swastika is just a benign Sanskrit good luck symbol.

 




 All "libruls" are tired of racism and gun violence in the name of distortions of claimed "states rights" and 2d amendment perversions. 




 Um. you're re-framing racism.  They LOST that war. 




 In 2001 I celebrated 15 years of continuous sobriety, but I felt as you are expressing in this post.  I felt like I had accomplished alot; I was sponsoring; professionally, I was doing the best work of my life and not enjoying the financial rewards that I felt like I was due; I was frequently enraged; and, finally, I relapsed.  The relapse miraculously ended in 2009. My [story is fairly well documented in the Saturday Share](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25u6cc/saturday_share_im_train_subject1576_and_i_am_an_alcoholic/) so I won't repeat it here.  My lesson: give TIME, TIME.  They like to say in AA: "don't leave the room before the miracle occurs."  This advice in my experience is totally true.  It's harder, much harder to come back and dig out of the damage--but, miracles of change in the human experience happen around us all the time, and if we're patient, within, too.

 Honestly, I don't get what Ohio voters are understanding about this pro-biz court.  The Ohio supremes are all about the 1%. 




 Are you working a recovery program?  Seeing a counselor?  Those things were invaluable to me when I was newly sober.  The AA 12 Steps for instance offer a systematic approach to identifying issues, and clearing away the wreckage of the past. 




 Welcome /u/dan_doomhammer to /r/stopdrinking -- so have you [tried the Baby Steps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/38ohrj/new_here_the_baby_steps_are_a_pretty_good_place/)  Its a post that lays out what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  Lots of SDers use aspects of it or so I'm told, to start stopping. 

Good luck to you. 




 Welcome /u/omarhajar84 to r/stopdrinking.  So at [this link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out exactly the next steps I took to start stopping.

 This is probably going to shock my friends on SD, but yes I believe that there are some people for whom controlled drinking works; but, I'm not that person.  Not only, am I not that person, I can't even get in the head of someone who would think controlled drinking is a good thing, although at one time I thought it would be nice to drink just fine wines--when I was in my pre-relapse home cooking phase and watching Food TV in the day when they had real cooking shows with teaching chefs.  The reality is that after 15 continuous years of sobriety my "controlled drinking" spun wildly out of control after about 2 weeks and then it took me 7 long hellish years to get back to recovery.  I have fully answered the question for myself--why would I want to?  I only ever wanted that elusive sensation that I got from drinking (or so I told myself) and after I relapsed, I discovered to my satisfaction that all I really ever could do was drink myself into stupor.  





























 The expression: Vanity Fair is a literary allusion to Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress--where the pilgrims after true spirituality are drawn to the material and absurd--debasing their quest for true connection. 




 I'm trying to remember ever meeting an alcoholic who LIKED being told what to do.  I'm sure there are one or two, but they're rare.  I love giving advice and I hate taking it; but I guarantee you that when I finally right-sized my ego, the good advice that I took worked out well for me.  

I love AA and AA meetings, but over time--not drinking, actively listening, I learned who I should listen to, and who I could discount.  Believe it or not, after awhile, people I discounted started to make a bit more sense.  Funny, that.

 That would be smart, but you can see there are numerous logistical challenges which was my larger point.  How do food, beverage, and restaurant suppliers access the cafe?  Underground tunnels?  Who is going to patronize this cafe`?  Pedestrians or do the planners intend to shuttle suburbanites from nearby off-square parking lots?  The practicalities begin to seem problematic. 




 You are more than welcome.  You might also think about doing the morning check-in--usually one of the top posts on the sub.  The morning check-in adapted the first idea from the Baby Steps into a daily ritual. 




 Um, where are the dumpsters going to be kept?

 Yeah, that sounds pretty dreadful. So did I share the [Baby Steps post with you in the past?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) These things worked for me, and I too was in a pretty dark place.  Good luck turning this around.

Good luck to you. 









 I don't think that's the issue, here.  The issue is the promises confidently made by this Governor who wants to be president and who got his cred by "disciplining public labor unions" as a pro-growth and pro-business political paradigm.  Typically, the rhetoric doesn't match the reality. 


































 Respectfully, this is ridiculous; CLIMATE change and the POPE's encyclical is explicitly about current US Politics and if you don't know this fact you aren't reading US Politics.  Once again, this is why it's on the Washington Post's POLITICS and OPINION pages. I could have take a dozen other articles about current GOP presidential campaigns dealing "explicitly" with this encyclical.  

 






















































 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping Thursday SOBER in solidarity with the SD sobernauts all around the world. 




 Thank you, Mouse, I've had a really stressful run of tough days--nothing to compare to yours--nonetheless, this was a great reminder.  TODAY is the new day.  Let's do it SOBER.   




 I agree.

Also don't be put off by beginner meetings and meetings where there are a lot of DUIs.  Lots of us came through the door on paper.  When I came back from a long multi-year relapse I was on paper for 2 years, I was no less sincere about recovery.

I'm just an old chunk of coal now Lord but I'm gonna be a diamond some day


I'm gonna learn the best way to walk gonna search and find a better way to talk

 Welcome /u/thecuriouswine--it sounds like you have a solid plan.  Best of luck. 




 Why not come clean with your wife that you are stopping drinking?  

Try doing this for yourself: I am not drinking TODAY, help me keep this commitment, because I can't do it alone. 




 Hail new centurion! 

It totally got easier for me at a 100 days; in fact, it sounds to me like you are on the verge of a significant breakthrough if you aren't already there.  Keep doing what you're doing. 



















 They almost always are. 




 This is a brilliant bit of advice; look for healthy new lifestyle reinforcers.  For me, personally, AA meetings and counseling helped enormously in the early days.    




 I am sure you're right.  Predators are predatory, they pick and choose victims opportunistically.  Remember during a significant part of that 15 years he was in prison for other crimes.

 When I was newly sober I was sitting in an AA meeting when someone said: It wasn't the 5th drink that sent me over the edge, it was the first.  Someone else interjected, It wasn't the caboose that killed him, it was the engine.   




 My late mother, God bless her--was NOT a good cook.  But her pineapple upside down cake made in a cast iron skillet was food of the Gods.  Yum, must make soon.

  I've gotta remember I am just not someone who can drink. I really really just can't.

I would turn this around, it's not about what I "can't do" (being an alcoholic a "can't do" is usually just a challenge "to do something I shouldn't); nope, what I CHOOSE to do is not drink TODAY, only.  I don't 'quit drinking" instead I make a renewable daily decision not to drink TODAY, only, no matter what happens good or bad.   




 Congrats on 6 months!

 At some point in my drinking career my only "friends" were guys who drank like me.  They reinforced my drinking.  When I made the decision to stop drinking I had to extinguish the old reinforcers.  I needed new friends, new venues, and new activities--that's what I got in recovery.

 You're really doing it, /u/xXThrowaway71Xx -- that's great news. 




 Welcome /u/legalize_crack to r/stopdrinking--the sidebar FAQ has lots of relevant information.

 You are not alone. 




 I personally was on the road the day I was able to stop drinking for 1 day.  I did it via the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post at this link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you.

 This was a huge step for you, congratulations! 




 Sure.  I wake up about 4:30 AM EST without an alarm clock apart from a cat.  After I flip on the light over my bed I take down the 24 hour a day meditation book and I read the day's entry.  I slide out of my bed onto my floor and I spend a few minutes reflecting on the AA 3rd Step and my wishes for family and friends.  I log on to /r/stopdrinking and record my commitment in the daily Check-in or later in the morning depending on what time it gets posted. Then I do a few things around the house and I'm off to coffee and to read the New York Times at a local Starbucks with my pal, "the Dude" where we solve the problems of the world, flirt with the women customers and hob nob with the other regulars.  Every Day.   




 I have to do all the things that are part of my daily sobriety rituals over and over again as a reminder, lest I forget.  There's an amusing insight about people like me: we are slow learners and quick forgetters. ; ) 




 Good luck! 




 1.  I didn't "quit drinking" which implies "forever."  Instead, using the [ideas at the Baby Steps post I stop drinking by making a renewable resolution to not drink TODAY, only no matter what happens good or bad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)

2. I was in professional and criminal trouble, and I was seriously considering killing myself; 

3.  I needed to extinguish the old reinforcers--friends, bars, clubs, events that fed my need to drink.  I found new reinforcers in recovery, morning rituals as I described in the [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) and by participation on r/stopdrinking.

Good luck to you. 




 Beautiful.  So glad you shared this.   




 Let's get it going.  I am not going to drink TODAY in solidarity with you. 




 One definition of alcoholism is progressively being unable to control the amount of drinking and actions under the influence of alcohol.  If you're interested in stopping why don't you consider the ideas at the [Baby Steps post?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Lots of us came to sobriety with doubt and after we spent time sober discovered that we highly valued the new way of life for a variety of reasons including never driving drunk. 




 Congratulations on you new resolve /u/randompete21 -- at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out exactly what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I hope that you will find something there that will resonate for you.  Best of luck. 




 Good deal, /u/dirtydan72 -- I hope you continue on the upward path for a good long time.   




 Then don't go. 

When I was new in sobriety I was told and I believed that my number one priority is my sobriety.  That gave me permission NOT to undertake stressful or anxiety provoking adventures.  There will be other Pride events in the future when you're more secure in your sobriety.  Good luck. 




 My advice is very simple: 1. you aren't qualified to run a sober house so don't try; 2. keep alcohol out of your premises; and, 3. go to al anon meetings.  You might also try asking your question at r/alanon.  I don't mean to be unsupportive but the situation sounds untenable in my experience. 

Best of luck with this and thank you for caring so much for an alcoholic to dare to undertake it.  I hope I'm wrong but it does not sound like a good idea for you, your family or your friend. 




 Wow, I am totally pumped for you.  Stay strong my friend.  And please keep updating us as you go along. 




 Good for you, /u/dansusedcars!  Keep doing what you're doing. 
























 Excellent post, /u/Skycakes -- I strongly relate to your experience.

 Good for you, so keep doing what you're doing and before you know it you will have a week--if you can stay focused on not drinking TODAY.  That's how it works for me. 




 Congratulations on 15 days!  That's great but that brings me to the [least popular advice in early sobriety: dry people, dry places.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2szkp8/the_least_popular_advice_dry_people_dry_places/)  Obviously, this is your sister's wedding, so you must attend, but what compels you to sit through a drinking reception and all that nonsense beyond an initial appearance and pictures?  

What I did in early sobriety was insure that I was at an AA meeting before and after the event.  That my transportation away from the event wasn't blocked-in, and I WALKED the moment I felt stress or temptation.

Good luck to you and keep us posted. 




 KJ, you have superb taste in music. 




 Welcome /u/SpanglesUK to r/stopdrinking.  At [this link is a post called the Baby Steps that you might find useful](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) of not as a good first place to find some simple "next actions."  The Baby Steps are the things I did to stop drinking and to get sober. 




 Good point! 




 My sponsor is a gentleman I met at one of my first meetings and who was familiar to me as an acquaintance from my professional life.  John G is about 10 years older than me, and I see or talk to him on average once a week.  He's like a big brother.  He's more conservative re: AA than I am, but he's also the primary source of the information that makes up [the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) I too shared the /r/stopdrinking website with him and he really doesn't get it, but toi be fair he really doesn't understand his cell phone, either--although I told him that lots of info that I communicate originated with him. 

I get SUPPORT and good information from John G about recovery and someone who will pick up the phone when I call.  I couldn't ask for more.  If I need friendship and running buddies I can find that too, although they don't need to be sponsors.  














 Welcome /u/throwawaycuzworried1 to /r/stopdrinking.  At the end of my drinking I was into major gyrations of anxiety and panic attacks.  Stopping drinking and staying stopped was my only hope and ultimately solution.  I was able to stop drinking by doing the [things I describe at the Baby Steps post which you can access at this link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you, you never have to go through this again if you don't pick up the next drink. 





























 I am so proud of you, my friend for all that you have accomplished. 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; and I'm grateful to be wide awake, rested, SOBER in Cleveland but able to click onto access to my brother and sister sobernauts worldwide on r/stopdrinking. 




 That's the historical comparison that comes to my mind.  Instead of red-baiting a la Nixon, we have Union-baiting. 









 Excellent post, /u/yurikovski!  But, my friend, this is far from unusual. Coming to see and value the lifestyle changes in alcohol abstinence is really the point of the push to sobriety.  And the insight that alcohol use is merely a symptom of a larger problem, is classic recovery dictum.  So, here's my cautionary note: an object in motion tends to stay in motion, a drinker who is not making progress often as not falls back into the drinking abyss.  I did after 15 continuous years of sobriety.  

Good luck, my friend.

 Good morning, /u/Nahbro211 --at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which describes how I got sober and which is not a bad place to look over a couple of ideas to start stopping drinking.  Good luck to you. 




 No problem, my bad.  I meant to scan the new posts and I got distracted. 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad.  I'm going to keep SOBER in Sunny and Dry (for the moment) Cleveland, all day.   
























 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens--in that case I don't have to worry about 4 days in a row, I concern myself with staying SOBER today, only.

 ; ) 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what my alkie brain tells me I want.  Fuck that thinking, I'm not listening to that lying bastard.  No matter what I am going to bed sober tonight. 




 Great post /u/big_mac_heart_attack.  I will say that when I was at 20 days sober I was in no position to judge whether I had lost a social life or not.  I was in no position to make any judgments about what the future held.  I was on an emotional roller coaster and it was going to takes some time before I could fairly assess anything.  I do know this--when I got sober I had to stay in dry places and with dry people to improve my chances of staying abstinent since in my experience and in the experience of my support network bars, clubs, and concerts were too close for comfort to my old reinforcers to my abusive drinking.  I needed new reinforcers which is what I got when I jumped into recovery which for me meant AA meetings and activities.  Good luck to you. 




 First, I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad.  Then I'm going to remind myself that anger and resentment are the chief offenders in relapse scenarios.  Next I'm going to step back and think--just like you're doing, about how my prior nonsense made her feel.  When I've established enough mental space around this, I'm going to suggest that we talk about how I must have made her feel when I did these things to her in the past because of how badly I felt.  Then I'm going to let it go.   







































 Thanks for stepping up this week.   




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping it SOBER in beautiful Cleveland and all over SD world. 




 I go to AA meetings by myself usually, and on rare occasions with others.  Your friend sounds like she's reaching out to you to be helpful, but don't misconstrue what she's saying that seems to minimize your "qualifications."  She's merely trying NOT to judge you or proselytize--letting you judge for yourself if I understand your post.  Go, have fun.  Let us know if you think you related. 




 I did not "quit drinking" which implies forever, instead I make a renewable daily decision that I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad and for today only.  I plan to make the same decision tomorrow, but who knows--tomorrow's not here yet. 




 I am so sorry to hear this.  The sober journey is sadly strewn with tragic and sometimes inexplicable losses.  We deal with alcoholism cunning, baffling and powerful.   




 Thank you, very much! 




 Welcome /u/BigDaddy350 to r/stopdrinking--[at this link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/38ohrj/new_here_the_baby_steps_are_a_pretty_good_place/) maybe something there will make some sense for you for starting stopping.  Good luck. 




 Whatever it takes, I am not drinking TODAY.   




 Good job /u/Leafybeans.  I pretty much know that the early days crawl by--we all want 5 years in one day, but it doesn't work out that way.  I can honestly say that at some point you really stop noticing--in fact, but for the badgebot, I would not know.   



















 I made a decision this morning that I am not going to drink TODAY no matter what--consistent with [the Baby Steps;](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/38ohrj/new_here_the_baby_steps_are_a_pretty_good_place/)  I went ot an AA meeting; I communicated with friends in my support network; and, even though I've had a pretty tough and anxious week I am going to bed sober.  If I thought there was any risk that I was going to drink tonight, I'd be in an AA meeting talking about it, but that's how I approach the issue.  I'm not going to throw away my continuous time sober because experience teaches me that no matter how bad I feel about anything if I don't drink it will get better.  This was true for me when I was in prison, this is true for me NOW.

 I'd love to know who wrote and sent out the talking points.  Roger Ailes? 







































 Recently I've been reading a scholarly work, *A Natural History of Alcoholism, Revisted* by Dr. George Vaillant, a Harvard professor of psychiatry which makes the point about "alcoholism" that academic research supports the view that alcoholism (and by definition alcoholics) deal with a "unitary disorder" or disease.  It is a disorder of some complexity and that alcoholism is NOT a matter of binary diagnosis, e.g. you got it or you don't. Instead alcoholism is often a *matter of degree* a lot like heart disease, or a diabetes.  To call it a disease is to simply underscore that once an individual has lost the capacity consistently to control how much and how often he or she drinks there is a sufficient basis to conclude that they are alcoholic and that treating the conditions makes considerable practical sense.

I don't know if that all comes off as clearly as I can see it--maybe because I'm an old guy and I get this whole heart disease/diabetes metaphor.  I'm a diabetic.  Consistently food of all sorts push my "A1C" as found on daily blood tests into a range that my chronic disease endangers my health: eyesight, heart, and puts me at risk of neuropathies, and amputation loss of extremities.  I can remain healthy and live a full life if I make proper daily decisions about my diet and exercise.  When my diabetes blood-sugar is consistently in the normal range it's easy to think I'm not diabetic, but I am.  I'm not powerless over my disease and in fact I am RESPONSIBLE for self-treatment.

The same with my alcoholism.  I am a real alcoholic, I've proved that to my complete satisfaction.  I am not afraid of the word at all.  I find it empowering.  No physician ever diagnosed me as alcoholic, and despite my several decades of recovery in AA, no one in an AA meeting ever "labeled" me as alcoholic.  I can not consistently control how much or how often I drink, if I drink even one drink.  Recovery via AA has given me a whole new way of life, and it has helped me find a path through the chaos of my life.  Finally, I've been able to put to rest the debating society in my own head about who I am and what I am responsible for. 









 Or . . . even the stopped clock is right twice a day.

 Excellent comment, the keyword is FEELING.  Boredom is just that an emotion just like happiness, anger, frustration, resentment, joy, desire, and cravings.  We get stronger each time we see the emotion and doggedly persist in our daily commitment to ourselves not to drink TODAY, only. 




 Welcome /u/standardcapacityman to r/stopdrinking.  I don't know what sort of device you're working off of so I don't know if you can see the sidebar, but there is a link to the 2014 survey which you might find enlightening.  Most of us report in the polling data that we were able to stop drinking with little or no discomfort.  Obviously to some extent or another we are all different and our use was different, but I'm suggesting that most of us get through the rapids pretty easily. At this [link is a post called the Baby Steps that lays](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  There might be some "next steps" for you too.  good luck. 




 When I came back after a 7 year relapse (I had been sober in a previous life for 15 continuous years) the same old things worked to stop drinking that had worked before.  Simple sober actions: [the Baby Steps were not beneath me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I still do them today. 




 The reason I don't drink TODAY is because I stayed sober long enough to begin to see and value my alcohol-free life.  Life  on life's terms.   




 Welcome back. 




 Yeah, the confederate flag ain't 'bout no racism. 














 Welcome /u/kittyhugtime to /r/stopdrinking -- at this [link you will find a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which describes exactly what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  Most of us come into recovery with some real painful memories and consequences.  At your young age you are poised to turn it around early and live a happy and full life.  Good luck. 




 Here's what works for me when I'm feeling "off" or that maybe I'm not as strong as was--I cling to the notion that I've felt this way in the past and it was usually a prelude to a breakthrough or some real insight that if I had not doggedly persisted I would never have arrived at.  I also cling to the hope and belief that my sharing even when I'm down--helps others when they are down and hanging on by what feels like fingernails.  That's what you did with this post /u/kittyislazy, you helped me. 



















 Congratulations /u/notyourtowndrunk on your week sober.  Each day it gets easier and you will have, bit by bit, more clarity.  Stay strong.

 Thank you, stranger on the internet. 




 Why don't you read through the [Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) to see if anything there makes sense as a place to start stopping.  It worked for me and plenty of others both on /r/stopdrinking and IRL.  Good luck to you. 
























 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; another beautiful day in Cleveland.  I plan to make the most of it. 




 I wrote this [post on this topic.  It's on the /r/alcoholism and in the SD sidebar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/2v573a/the_where_why_and_what_should_i_expect_at_my/)  Please update us and let us know how your first meeting goes! 




 Good for you, /u/dirtymartini74.  Also look at the daily check-in as a routine.  I find it very helpful. 














 I'm glad you're going to give SOBER a shot.   




 Welcome /u/Timetostop1989 to r/stopdrinking.  On the sidebar the results of the annual survey of our population is available.  It's a massive amount of information about almost every aspect of our demographic.  Amazingly, by far and away most of us stopped drinking cold turkey, and most of us reported little or no discomfort.  

Now for how to go about it, why don't you look over the [Baby Steps post at this link?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  It has some good ideas for the "next things" you might want to consider as part of the move to sobriety.  Good luck to you. 









 Welcome /u/nocheesenoprob -- I'm one of the ancient mariners of SD, although Slip's got a few days on me. I'm a cyclist, bike commuter, and I live and work in Cleveland.  I'm also the guy who posts the [Baby Steps link for newcomers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I hope to see you around.   




 I had to get rid of these notions of "I should feel...this or that."  We are all different, different DNA, different experiences within a spectrum.  What I do know that works is not drinking TODAY and dogged persistence.  Someone once told me: don't leave the room before the miracle occurs; and, miracles do occur in recovery. 




 Each day that you stay stopped is one day closer to real sobriety.  You know this because we are telling you so and we have credibility.  We have credibility on these topics because we've been there.  

Good luck. 




 Here's what worked for me; don't drink TODAY no matter what and: 

1. Recognize that the first two weeks will probably suck;

2. No coffee, caffeine of any sort after midday;

3. Shut off all electronics an hour before bedtime; 

4. Except for soothing music. 

Remember, many of us went through this and our body and brains are healing.  Sleep will come.  And usually when it does we reach a point where our bodies and brains want to do nothing BUT sleep.  That's ok too.  Good luck. 




 Wow, welcome back to life!  I'm moved by your courageous sharing of this post.   




 Welcome /u/ThePennyDropped -- good vent!  So at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is designed to suggest some good "next actions" to stopping drinking and getting sober.  These are the things that worked for me.  Good luck to you. 




 I will not drink TODAY in solidarity with you. 




 Good for you, /u/SDstrawburry -- I'm pulling for you. 




 Welcome /u/flow59 to r/stopdrinking.  Perhaps in your past visits to the sub you came across the [Baby Steps post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  That post lays out what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  The post attempts to suggest some good starter actions.  Good luck to you, I hope you get traction this time.   









 Posting and commenting serves others--and serves ourselves. 









 In my experience the way to never let the bad shit happen again is to start each day anew with the resolution not to drink TODAY, only and keep to that commitment.  It's amazing how quickly we can rebound and find the energy and momentum to turn our lives around especially if we actively work some sort of recovery program.  Remember it takes action not words. 




 You are doing a great job, super proud of you. 














 It's hard to believe that this ass-clown has a law license and a Harvard Law degree.  Apparently his oath to uphold the laws and constitution are secondary to his political pandering and ambition. 




 Welcome /u/SuperMegaCoolPerson to r/stopdrinking--I do the [things I describe at the Baby Steps post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I do these things everyday. 




 This is so true.  My sponsor had 10 months of sobriety when I asked him to sponsor me.  I knew him previously from my profession.  He was a like a big brother to me and he has been for 30 years the same solid rock.   




 I agree with this 100%. 




 Recovery and sobriety works best, in my experience, when you do "service work"--and on /r/stopdrinking there are many opportunities to do service for the community as the morning Check-in volunteers demonstrate.  There are lots of other options, like commenting on newcomer posts, "attaboys and attagirls" for milemarker posts, and participation on the Chat, movie night, and so forth.  Find your niche, or invent it as others have done in the past and you may find that you are ahead of the game.   




 Obviously, I'm late to this post, but I wanted to congratulate you on accomplishing the challenge and for this terrific post. 
























 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; sober in soggy Cleveland!

 Welcome /u/redgalatea to /r/stopdrinking.  I'm sorry that you have struggled with relapse.  Relapse is a HUGE part of my story.  I also deal with, or dealt with manic-depression.  I got sober by doing the things I describe at the [Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  As far as programs and faith--I hear you.  I'm super happy with my agnostic AA meeting home group which has enabled me to fully dive into recovery.

Good luck to you. 




 Did you read through the [Baby Steps post?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  A lot of us on /r/stopdrinking  have used the ideas there to find a start to stopping. Good luck to you. 




 What?  Of course /r/law is the place for such distinctions.   




 By insistence in a dissent that it's my way or the highway; by inflammatory language, and through ad hominem attack on fellow justices.   




 Good for you.  You could always catch an out of town AA meeting.  I always found that an interesting adventure and something that advanced my sobriety. 




 Let me be clear then.  Scalia's snark heavy dissent does absolutely NOTHING for the respect of the law or our institutions, the constitution, the court, or comity.  Scalia, who invites readers of his dissent to "go ask the nearest  hippie"--appears to be tainted by his Opus Dei religious dogma and is apparently blind to his increasingly bizarre distortions.   




 Good for you.  

But this brings to mind [the post called: The least popular advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2szkp8/the_least_popular_advice_dry_people_dry_places/)--which is dry people and dry places in early sobriety.  At 23 days sober there is no good reason to be in a club where the temptation to drink is ever present as you acknowledge.  Please be careful, my friend.   




 What an obnoxious post.  Prairie Home Companion is a significant media institution created by a formidable New Yorker writer that may elude your limited cultural understanding but which preserved, honored and satirized mid-twentieth century radio broadcasts; illustrated the history of the rural to urban transformation of America; and provided a weekly forum for all sorts of brilliant live music especially the obscure but worthy long before YouTube existed.  Your inability to grasp this fact does not render PHC or Keillor's artistic contributions invalid.  

P.S. Keillor is a Mid-westerner not a New Englander.  Keillor has more authenticity in his little finger than most of artists whose performance altars the Reddit hivemind worship at. 









 His reasoning is INFECTED with rightwing Christian dogma.  That's what I meant.   









 Rock bottom is a metaphor not a place.  Everybody's rock bottom is different.  The only real question is when was I going to stop digging.  I didn't have to dig my way into professional disciplinary problems, federal prison, loss of reputation, material ruin--but I did.  

I did find a way out and a way back via [the things I describe at the Baby Steps post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) I hope you'll join us in the sober life boat. 




 Good honest post.  That's where I was in relapse.  But I got back by not assuming that since I had previously been sober for 15 years I could skip the basic starter steps.  It's like a lot of things I used to be able to do--play guitar, speak Spanish...I had to go to the very beginning.  [Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) 




 Scalia seems to be stumbling over it. 




 I can't wait to see this! 




 Sustained time sober solved all my sleep disorders.  In the interim I would limit the caffeine to the early part of your day; not drink too much water 90 minutes before bedtime; and, I'd go with relaxing music in the half hour before sleep.   




  When I first stopped drinking, I scoured this sub, looking for posts from people with lots of time, trying to figure out what their lives looked like. What had changed? What was better? This is going to be worth it, right?

You answered the question for yourself.  The answer was always there--inside yourself.  No one could answer for you for that very reason.
 









 NO.  No, binge eating is not as bad as binge drinking.  I never drove a car into the rear of another car in an automated carwash on potato chips.  I never went to prison on a pint of ice cream.

Of course, compulsive eating is a SERIOUS disorder that should not be ignored, but we shouldn't minimize our obligation to deal with first things first.   




 I will not drink TODAY in solidarity with you.  You did a masterful job of describing the same thinking and feeling I had around my relapse after 15 continuous years of sobriety.  Two weeks of control and genius drinking which descended quickly into abysmal addict drinking that lasted for 7 years. It was a miracle that I got back at all.   


































 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; in the immortal words of Antonin Scalia; go ask a hippie! 




 Except for the obnoxious title--the article really does capture this singular perspective. 














 I know.  It's a hipster-ism.   









 That's exactly right.  The other part of this is--conservatives throw around "unconstitutional, tyranny, activist Judges"-argument forgetting that the SCOTUS and many of these judges are THEIR appointees: Kennedy, Roberts, and so forth.  In other words, their constitutional scholars would beg to disagree. 




 My wife drinks.  But I have a completely developed support system of friends and activities that are SOBER.   




 Do you need any further reminder why the GOP can not be trusted with lifetime appointments to the federal courts? 









 Well-done /u/pickpickpick for making this connection. 




 I can see how this feels this way for you IF the only thing you are doing is being alcohol abstinent. In my experience this is called being restless, irritable and discontent, aka, the RIDs.  The answer for me was getting ACTIVE in recovery--by activity in recovery I found new ways to reinforce my sobriety with new friends, new activities, and new daily rituals.   




 Hang in there /u/xXThrowaway71Xx -- this is life on life's terms.  If I told you about the challenges of my first year of my current sobriety you might be shocked.  But I got invaluable face-to-face support every day at AA meetings.  




 Words that are detached from reality. 
























 This is an excellent point.  If he were a sitting local judge he would draw ethics complaints for this sort of nonsense.   




 My mistake. 



















  No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies
the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice,
and family. In forming a marital union, two people become
something greater than once they were. As some of
the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage
embodies a love that may endure even past death. It
would misunderstand these men and women to say they
disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do
respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its
fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned
to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilizations
oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the
eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.

 [The Opinion.](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf) 














 I remember falling off a pink cloud, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't at 25 days into sobriety.  What I'm saying is this: early sobriety is a roller coaster of emotions with highs (probably not pink clouds) and lows.  Don't drink today, and I would bet that sometime, 90 days or so from now--a real pink cloud might really give you a ride of your life.  That's my experience. 




 I have to have courage when things don't go my way or aren't the way I believe they should be.  So in being courageous I win the inevitable wrestling match with MY ego.  I drop my narcissistic obsession with how I am perceived or how I perceive myself and I do what's right.  Sometimes what's right is merely to accept reality.   




 Quite a thought-experiment, that.  Lessee, Bill-O would convene morality panels.  Hannity would be in high-dundgeon.  It would be endless. 




 When I was a newcomer to sobriety my sponsor (who gave me most of the ideas that became the [Baby Steps)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) post laughed when I told him that there was no way I could do 90 AA meetings in 90 days.  He asked, How many days a week did you drink?  How many days a week were you in bars and liquor stores?  How many days a week were you hungover?  

AA meetings provided me with sober friends, sober activities, and a path to my authentic self.   


































 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; happy Friday in SD world! 




 That's just great. I am so happy for you.   









 Hey, /u/hasvegetables I've been right where you are: filled with guilt and remorse and uncertain how to proceed.  Fortunately, my AA sponsor gave me some simple steps forward which along with lots of other info that I've picked up over time I've included in something I call the [Baby Steps which you can find at this link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I learned to do the simple sober things on a daily basis and I can quite assure you that I don't carry a load of guilt or shame or remorse around with me anymore.  Good luck to you. 
























 Certainly at least 6 experts on constitutional law disagree with him. 









 Amazing news, opinion, dissent, and political discussion in /r/politics and r/law. 




 You really capture the essence of life behind bars.  I came back from my 5 months at FCI, Morgantown in 2010 and I told my wife that I was so angry at myself for feeling absolute hatred for some people I knew and resided with in those months.  Sadly, there have been at least one occasion since with a guy in AA where I felt those same feelings, so I strongly relate to this post.  Now imagine that your confidentiality is breached--things you said in a meeting were shared "on the yard."  Wow.   




 That's a bullseye. 




 Welcome /u/sbarks to r/stopdrinking.  Personally, I found it ultimately not relevant that I answer *a priori* the question: Am I an alcohlic?  What I needed instead was some sustained time sober and the clarity that brings.  So at this [link is a set of ideas called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is based on my own experiences stopping drinking and getting sober.  I hope something there will be helpful to you.  Good luck. 




 That's AWESOME!

 Congratulations, db! 




  In a democracy, the power to make the law rests with
those chosen by the people. Our role is more confinedto
say what the law is. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137,
177 (1803). That is easier in some cases than in others.
But in every case we must respect the role of the Legislature,
and take care not to undo what it has done. A fair
reading of legislation demands a fair understanding of the
legislative plan.

 Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve
health insurance markets, not to destroy them. If at all
possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent
with the former, and avoids the latter. Section 36B
can fairly be read consistent with what we see as Congresss
plan, and that is the reading we adopt

 It's top secret.

 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; Monday on. my mind! 




 Good one, KJ, but you had me at Mark Twain. 




 I can only speak for myself--but, early only (and thankfully) I got involved in AA, mostly because I was afraid of what I mistakenly imagined AA to be--a bunch of old men shaking over styrofoam cups of coffee on folded chairs presided over by the Jayzus-cult.  I was so willing and open minded at that point in my life I was willing to try anything to get and stay sober.  So AA meetings worked for me--and, it was at an AA meeting that I encountered the idea of getting a sponsor (mine's like a Big Brother) and more importantly I found the [AA 12 Steps.](http://silkworth.net/aa/12steps.html)  Working with my sponsor and support network I "did the Steps" which is a systematic way of addressing guilt, shame, misdeeds, and my fears about my damaged relationships.  Oh, and I didn't catch religious cooties--in fact I suspect that to the consternation of some in AA meetings when I hear too much God-talk I aggressively shoot down the notion that belief or non-belief in anything or any God-like being is prerequisite to successfully working an AA program--it's not.   




 Hey, congratulations, an invite to join us on /r/dinos will shortly follow in your inbox. 




 My condolences, /u/bigndfan175.  Our journey is sadly often populated with tragic losses and ghosts.  




 I've long contended that Kasich is running for Veep. 




 I'm sure some of this is just language--but a future commitment to do something almost never worked out for me,  I need to act NOW, not later.  I am not doing to drink TODAY, NOW--and I am going to doggedly persist in that commitment to myself.  

Good luck on getting that first SOBER day, again. 




 You are so amazing, my friend!  You got your whole life going on and you radiate such good will and inspiration in your posts and comments.  I wish you many, many more sober milestones.   




 What worked for me are the simple sober actions I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  If your post is a prayer, consider these comments answers from our experience of being where you are at and finding answers.

 Congratulations on your half-year SOBER.  Now, you have a running start on a whole new way of life.  Keep doing what you're doing. 
























 Good for you.  You have a lot of insight at 2 weeks, keep stepping forward and you will be astounded before long. 



















 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad;. In the aftermath of the holiday I am super happy to do Sunday SOBER in Cleveland! 




 Congratulations, u/jski7!  An invite to join us on /r/dinos will shortly follow in your inbox. 




 Congratulations, friend, I just added you to r/dinos--you were long entitled to membership. 




 That's great! 









 When I got sober I utilized ideas that [I summarize at a post called the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  What this entailed was extinguishing old reinforcements to my former drinking self and creating new reinforcement for the SOBER person I became. Early on this meant dry people in dry places.   




 This would only happen to me if I wasn't HONESTLY trying to stop drinking.  The way I was able to stop drinking and get sober first required that I get HONEST. 




 Cravings are a powerful desire for (in this instance) alcohol.  By definition a craving is an emotion which if I give into it, I reinforce.  The way to combat a craving is to substitute other reinforcements--like recovery meetings, socializing with dry people in dry places (coffee houses), pursue an athletic endeavor or other interest.  If I don't give in to a craving, the powerful desire will disappear over time.   




 I am not responsible for my disease, but I am responsible for my recovery,  You got good sober time in the past, /u/saltwatermonkey -- you can do it again.  Don't drink TODAY. 




 Great post.   




 No doubt about it.  Keep doing what you're doing. 




 Drinking dreams are such a common phenomena that there is an FAQ  mention of them.

 I am not drinking TODAY, fortune will play no role in that decision.  Alcohol will not magically appear in my hand or near my mouth all day. 




 I'm [with you!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)

 Congratulations--which reminds me of something they say in AA: if you skip the 4th (Steps) you'll drink a 5th.  AA humor can be deadly :D 




 I'll [start with the Parade!](http://imgur.com/ZjoPinB)  And my all my guests lined up at my house to watch the marching bands, and hoopla.

 /r/badlawyer  









 Ow-y.   



















 Personally, I treat every day, no matter the occasion, no matter the event, no matter the friends who are there or not, no matter who's drinking or not--as one more day in which I will make a decision not to drink TODAY no matter what AND doggedly persist in the commitment to myself.  It is not lost on me that many of you are struggling, maybe even obsessing over this holiday weekend (it's Independence Day in the US)--that's natural in early sobriety.  But if you can win the daily SOBER victory future holidays, or upheavals will be much easier to handle.  Let's celebrate our independence from alcohol this weekend!  Who's in? 




 Let me be clear--life is not BORING.  Boredom is a common *emotion* in early sobriety that with sustained time sober most of us get over.  My experience is that we are well-advised to be on guard around all of our emotions in early sobriety since our alkie-thinking can use any of these sensations as an excuse for relapse, especially anger and resentment.  Good work on the 15 days sober! 
























 I am so proud to be a member of this community.  Thank you mods, regulars, newcomers and lurkers, too for being a part of the whole of this online SOBER movement.

 It takes practice but I try to never borrow tomorrow's concerns.  In fact even in the midst of a shit storm, if I can find the presence of mind to inventory my exact situation, I can manage pretty well.  I'm not perfect, but a lot better than I was just a few years ago.  It's how I handled being criminally prosecuted for tax evasion, how I handled being sentenced to prison, how I handled prison and the aftermath.  I can handle the challenges of  TODAY, sober. 




 Hey /u/sweetpea122--my 4th of July plan is to go to bed sober tonight, plan to commit to staying sober all day tomorrow and I will deal with July 4th on the morning of July 4th. 




 Hey, /u/fr0ver84, been there did all that AND my wife and I continue to recover and reconcile and we are relatively happy.  Of course, all relationships are different.  Don't drink TODAY, plan not to drink tomorrow and your consistent sober actions can turn your life around.  By not making my sobriety dependent on the outcomes in my relationships, my relationships recovered with my consistent sober actions.  




 The dead-on smart but UNPOPULAR recovery advice is: 1. dry people and dry places; and, or 2. avoid relationships during the first year of sobriety.  Your honest post illustrates the reasons why this advice developed early on in the history of the recovery movement.   









 Most of us feel better by day 4, although some feel generally crappy for a couple of weeks.   




 For me it all boiled down to REMORSE.   




 Here's what I would do: I would not drink TODAY and plan not to drink tomorrow, too--and, through my consistent sober actions make all of the fear and concern about my alcoholism misplaced.  BTW, alcoholism is often defined as an obsession in which the compulsion to drink is but a symptom of our mental disorder.  Put another way, my drinking was only slightly less concerning secondary to my thinking disorder.  Sustained time sober changed all of that. 




 Congratulations, I had faith in you.  Good work.  Now let's go for 89+1+1+1+... 




 At the root of nearly every resentment or feeling of anger, is my fear about loss of something. 




 Good for you.  The nice thing about the 90 day challenge is that the time involved really seems to grant you considerable clarity.  Please keep posting and updating as you go along. 




 Yeah, most of us with bad withdrawal really struggle for a couple of days.  But, here's the good news: don't pick up the next drink and you NEVER have to go through it again. 




 I will not drink TODAY in solidarity with you.  Good work, my friend.   




 When I make the daily decision not to drink TODAY no matter what, alcohol is out of my movie for the day.  What other people do, what other events occur, good news or bad--none of it matters to me in terms of alcohol.  I made a commitment to myself this morning, end of story.  And as far as I am concerned there is NO FREE BOOZE or beer--somebody always pays.  The alcoholic pays with body, brain, and sometimes immediate tragedy.

I am not going to drink TODAY. 




 Congratulations!  Yay!  But, 'Rocks is a hermaphro...?

 Welcome /u/BoilerKing to r/stopdrinking. There's a saying in sobriety, no one comes through the doors of recovery doing cartwheels.

 Great post and comments, all I can add is my best wishes on moving forward and keeping sobriety a priority. 
























 I am so sorry that you are dealing with this illness but the recommendation of Al Anon *is not* a meaningless gesture.  It works.  Let me explain how it worked in my life as THE ALCOHOLIC.  My wife started going to Al Anon meetings without saying one word to me about it.  I could see and sense some sort of change come over her that I didn't understand.  When I did confront her about where she was going and what had changed she explained that it was Al Anon meetings.  Amazed and genuinely clueless, I asked her who the alcoholic was?  When she said, "You." I was floored.  The seriousness of my situation had in an instant become real to me.  And while it would be some time before I finally got sober, I could never shake the message.  In her actions to take care of herself, she communicated what ultimately I needed to hear--the unshakeable truth.  

Good luck to you.

 As a rule I avoid "tests."  The only test I need to pass is the one where I decide that I am not going to drink; and I persist to bedtime.  On the otherhand my wife drinks fine wine (although she kept it out of the house for 10 months or so after I got sober again in 2009) and my wife's enjoyment of her glass of wine at supper 4-5 days a week is fine with me.  After I make my daily decision not to drink TODAY no matter what--alcohol is out of MY movie for the day.  Others drinking has NO impact upon me, and if it did I would leave the vicinity.  Nothing is going to change that today.

 Good for you!  Keep doing what you're doing. 




 Of course, my Plan A is to find an AA meeting near where I'll be.  I've been to many cool out of the way AA meetings over the years.   




 Have an awesome time, you so deserve all the blessings after the hardwork you did over the last year and half.  I'm so proud of you.  Please stay in touch and remember, almost anywhere in the world there is an AA meeting close by should you need that feeling of being connected face-to-face. 




 For me boredom was an emotion I had to learn to dispel which I was able to do by finding new activities and sober reinforcement.  I got all of that and a path through the ups and downs of sobriety via AA meetings and activity. 




 Rule 8.4 of the ABA model rules:

It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:

(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;

(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice;

 Real peace is an inside job ; ) 




  I've tried AA but hey I'm a queer, transgender Atheist....AA isn't exactly my comfort zone.

In my neighborhood here on the westside of Cleveland, being queer, trans, and atheist might land you in anyone of 40 regular weekly meetings.  So why not consider finding an AA meeting that is close to what feels comfortable then creating an LGBT/atheist meeting? 




 I can feel this, /u/Sober_Kosh -- but AA meetings met this call to create new and effective social relationships and reinforcers for my sobriety.   I am an ex-drinker and when I recognized and accepted that fact, I abolished cravings. 




 Well-done.  You know how I shut down the alkie thinking?  When a thought occurs to me, I go: oh, yeah, but not TODAY because I made a commitment not to drink TODAY.  For me it's about that daily decision not to drink, and as my pal /u/offtherocks said, dogged persistence in keeping the commitment. 









 I think this is a great idea. 












































 The GOP is not racist, but it's number 1 with racists.

After a shower, feeding the pets, and making a pot of coffee to leave by my wife's bedside table I head out to my local Starbucks where I read the New York Times and hang out with my pal aka, the Dude.  The two of us have become such an institution at this SBUX that we've made tons of sober friends, SBUX regulars, and even networked various business deals including recently introducing an orthopedic surgeon to his new medical practice--just by hanging out and learning the names of regulars.  




 Good for you, please keep doing what you're doing. 




 Congratulations, you have a running start on a whole new way of life.   




 Thanks for this insight. 




 Exactly right. 




 I've been there, but by continuing not to drink it got better and it got better pretty quickly.  









 That sounds just like my "adventure in moderation" after 15 continuous years of sobriety.  After two weeks I descended into a 7 year hell-on-earth relapse.  I am truly grateful to be a month away from my 6 year anniversary, again.  I did it one day at a time.  




 There are lots of living examples of this right on this sub. 




 Good job on telling on yourself.  I hope this was cathartic for you.  If I were you, I would focus ENTIRELY on recovery for the next 90 days and listening.  Noon and early evening AA meetings work for me. 




 I'm so glad you are choosing to begin again.  I am not drinking TODAY in solidarity with you. 




  My own prison was in a bottle, my own dark thoughts were the razor wire, I don't want to go back there either.

This reminds me so much of the Harriet Tubman quote, I paraphrase: I freed a thousand slaves, I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew that they were slaves. 







































 "Hedge" really sounds like he's saying: I love my wife, but her in-laws can stay out. 



















 Not a problem, didn't see it. 





























 Yeah, the Massey Energy CEO, Don Blankenship bought chunks of the WV Supreme Court just to win a civil lawsuit.  He loved it! 




 Hey, /u/SoggyAugi -- I wrote a "what's next" post [called the Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  The Baby Steps are entirely based on my personal experience, but lots of us on /r/stopdrinking use these ideas in our own ways to find a path.  Good luck to you. 




 Nothing bad in my life, nothing at all--was ever improved by adding alcohol.  I have been at the precipice, and by choosing to not drink my life got better.  I feel for you, brother.  Hang in there. 




 He had remarkable insights and he was a deeply compassionate teacher. 












































 Yeah, this is how I make the distinction between interest and commitment.  I am committed to my daily decision not to drink TODAY, so I doggedly persist.  I am interested in playing my guitar, and too many days in a row it merely sits at my elbow...condemning me, LOL. 




 I saw Father Martin, live at the Cleveland Masonic Auditorium back in the late 1980s, what a hoot.   




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; keeping Thursday SOBER in Cleveland.   
























 Welcome /u/Leaping_ezio to r/stopdrinking.  At this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  Maybe you will find some ideas there that will be helpful to you.  Good luck. 




 My body and my central nervous system were healing for the first month or so.  It makes some logical sense that you might be feeling nausea in the early days sober.  The healthy gut bacteria may be rebuilding its biome in the GI.  If you continue to have symptoms, by all means go see a licensed professional. 




 When I stopped drinking in both 1986 and then later in 2009 I found psychological counseling invaluable to addressing anger and other troubling issues.  I'm grateful that I had the resources available to me at that time to obtain counseling. 




 Good work.  You might also [do the morning check-in with us.](http://is.gd/afsucks)

 Wow, that's terrific!  I am so proud of you.

 I was sentenced to federal prison about a year after I returned to sobriety in August 2010.  I had been a nationally prominent civil trial lawyer with a business worth potential millions.  I was disgraced and fearful and miserable and I didn't drink.  I didn't drink the day I was sentenced or any day since that time by doing what I talk about all the time: I made a daily decision not to drink TODAY and I doggedly persisted.  No single event, no bad news or good, no sadness, no disappointment, no loss is too great to bear for one day.  Then I repeat, tomorrow.  

My life is filled with happiness, joy, and freedom because of the decision I make TODAY not to drink.   














 That one was really my bad, I intended to send that to whole other subreddit.   




 Yes, but why are the citizens of Ohio funding our Gov's run for another political office.  Security for a presidential run is a whole lot more involved and expensive than for a vacation for a non-presidential candidate.  I think then SC Gov. Mark Sanford proved that. 




 Well, then again, there's that. 




 I think it's a mistake to think just because someone makes money they can't also be an idiot or politically and socially unacceptable.  Trump falls into that category in my opinion.  He is beyond the pale.   




 There are also online meetings: [here](http://www.aa-intergroup.org/directory_venue.php?code=AV) and [here.](http://www.aaonline.net/) 









 OK, I'm glad I asked.  

Personally, I am not that different than you in terms of the underlying anxiety issues and to be honest, even though I live in a major American city (Cleveland) AA can be a little like high school from the standpoint of early sobriety.  On the other hand, given some blind courage and a gritting commitment to just go and actively listen my entire life (including my bipolar disorder) changed positively for the better.  Also, most of my preconceptions even about how I would be received were completely mistaken.  This has been my experience with AA everywhere I've gone over 30 years.  

Go it alone didn't work for me, but it may work for you.  Good luck, and I hope you will consider keeping /r/stopdrinking for support. 



















 Good for you, /u/Trunner3000.  Preparation is ACTION and personally, I found acting my way into better thinking worked a whole lot better than trying to think my way into better acting. 




 Congratulations, /u/cake_or_radish on 345 days!!!

 Why is AA bullshit (in your city)? 



















 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping hump day SOBER in Cleveland. 




 This is great progress.  Too often newcomers in the throes of early sobriety give up hope of feeling better but you are am example that even a couple of weeks cam be huge.  Keep doing what you're doing
 




 Great to hear from you, GS.  Don't be a stranger if you can help it. 




 I have so many activities that 24 hours is insufficient to the purpose, but I do remember that time in early sobriety when I felt at loose ends--what now?--I asked myself. I jumped into AA meetings and activities, that was huge.  Then I asked myself what did I always want to do.  In my case I always wanted to play guitar, so I signed up for an adult education class, then private lessons, and then I joined a group.  It was great.  I resumed avid cycling and I joined a cycling group for weekly night rides.  I joined a sober bowling and gold league.  My life was soon overwhelmed with activities. 




 I actually did some of the pioneering law in this area in the US.  In my experience families are universally viewed as the victims of abuse; although in one instance I represented a family who came into possession of photographic evidence of abuse and who turned over the evidence to prosecutors only to be charged with possession of "child porn."  The charges would in due course be dismissed, but I suppose it goes some to prove your point. 














 I've read extensively in the Orange Papers and while the obsessiveness of Agent Orange is remarkable, the work is poisoned by the sort of thinking that has no actual meaning or purpose other than to air out Orange's grievance and crap all over other's recovery.  As SM2L says, it has nothing at all to do with my experience in recovery.   




 Or maybe just truing. 




 They should be smoking. 



















 Welcome /u/BlackDogBlues66 to /r/stopdrinking -- at the [link is a post that sets out some "next steps"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) for the newly sober that are based on something my AA sponsor called "baby steps."  I hope you feel motivated to check-in regularly on the sub and keep us posted on your progress. 




 Ah, I'm sorry, /u/equallyconfusing that you find yourself in this sad situation.  I've been there in so many ways and for me it always began with the first drink.  I had to stop drinking, [the Baby Steps are how I did it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Then I needed sustained time sober, finally I needed RECOVERY which gave me a systematic way of making the appropriate amends to those I hurt.  Until I did all those ACTIONS, my words were worthless.   














 Maybe a week or two at most. 




 Hey, /u/thenewmeihope -- this is what I call "writing checks drunk, that sober I can't cash."  It's OK. It's more than OK if you draw the lesson you're drawing.  Down the road, maybe you can make amends, but for the time being, let it go works best in my experience. 




 After 15 continuous years of sobriety, I went back out to drink moderately.  I was successful too, for 2 weeks.  Then I descended into the deepest, darkest hole.  It took many years and it was only by some miracle not of my doing that I was able to come back to life in 2009.   Nope, not for me.  




 Wow, powerful stuff that.   




 Interesting, but I don't think the medical and mental health communities are at all focused on the "spiritual entity" part of recovery when they make the recommendation to attend AA meetings.  I think instead they realize that AA meetings are the most easily accessible, affordable, and effective programs of recovery.  

And might one, just "skip the middle man" and just go right to some conception of God?  If that were true there would be no drunk Roman Catholic priest, LOL!  In my experience, it is not a religious zeal, or spirituality that is at the heart of the recovery from alcoholism--it is instead an appreciation that ALCOHOL is the higher power and self will or will power alone can not in the usual case, beat the disease.  Instead a core recognition that the power of fellowship with like-minded others who are on a sober journey IS the solution.  From time immemorial, religious "cures" had been proposed and failed.  AA grew up as a radical reaction against the "moral" cure of the Women's Temperance Union, the Baptist pledge, and the Oxford Group.   




 I slipped through a changing light the other day in a retail district of my town.  The Honda from the side street that I passed on my right pulled up beside me and the passenger rolled her window down and said, "You give all bicyclists a bad name."  I replied, "Yeah, that's a shame, but even people on bicycles make mistakes, though I'm sure you never do."  Let's not all pretend that every action or inaction is from a place of malice or arrogance. 




 Well-said.   




 Great and powerful post, /u/rose_the_wolf.  I am majorly pulling for you friend. 




 Let's do this, CR! 




 Welcome to our sub, /u/heyizabella (Isabella was my fav cat)--so at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  Maybe something there will be helpful to you.  I hope to see you checking-in daily. 




 Good for you! 




 I think there is pretty good evidence that in early sobriety coffee is a net positive.  It's frankly why one of the symbols of AA is the coffee pot. 




 I toughed it out; because my brain, my body, my central nervous system were healing and the experience of others told me that it would take a little time before I reached equilibrium.   




 I totally agree.  This isn't support, it's purchase. 




 Did you ever read my /r/stopdrinking [Baby Steps post?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Why don't you come join us on that sub?  We are actively taking action to stop drinking. 




 Seriously, folks, don't screw the clients. 


































 The discipline I imposed on myself in my early AA was to go, listen and listen actively to each person without judgment.  It didn't take me long to see myself in many aspects of what others said and to learn some discernment skills, taking what helped and leaving the rest behind.  The mere action of going, and listening was all that I needed in the first days and weeks.   




 You are on the verge of being eligible to do the morning check-in if you're interested! 




 Outstanding, I've been off for several days around the holiday, too.  I go back to work tomorrow and I agree, the time off has been wonderful. 




 Welcome /u/silkslittedsheets to /r/stopdrinking -- if you've been in "lurk" you may or may not have come across the [Baby Steps link](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I'm convinced based on some feedback that the Baby Steps are not a bad place to start stopping.  One of the things that I've also found very useful is the sub's Daily Check-in.  It's turning into a running narrative for a lot of us as we go along.  Good luck. 




 I'll do more than wish you luck; I'll share [the Baby Steps link](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) with you in the hope that something that worked for me will resonate with you and help as you go along. 




 This observation about speakers trying to convince themselves that AA works, may be true.  Remember, as they say in recovery "De-nile (denial) is not a river in Egypt" and in early recovery we are often still awkwardly selling ourselves on recovery.  Embedded in AA recovery is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy--a deliberate focus on changing behaviors in order to change thinking.  I often compare it to learning how to play guitar--which I successfully undertook in early sobriety.  At first it's really hard, awkward, uncomfortable.  Nothing came easily for me.  But as I slowly learned chords, scales, and songs and I practiced my brain automatically sped me up so that I sound pretty good even with my rudimentary skill set.  The same's true for new people in AA.  They may look awkward, or even phony, but let's not judge--in many cases these are the same hopeless, helpless drunks that made little or no sense when we sat on the barstool next to them staring at Sportscenter on the TV over the bar. 









 I would highly suggest that you post at /r/alanon or better yet check out an Al Anon meeting IRL.  This is not a "blow off" my ex-wife's most powerful and loving action--working an Al Anon program--changed her life and mine.  Best of luck to you and the alcoholic in your life. 




 What worked for me were the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  These simple sober actions worked for me and lots of others too, long before I ever came across them and re-worked the ideas for this sub.  So good luck to you, /u/funkhouser1907. 




 Here's the thing about your powerful post; because you have 9 days and are saying these things you have the proximate credibility to be persuasive to newcomers when with some years of sobriety we can say the words and fall on deaf ears.  Congratulations, keep doing what you are doing and you will find your authentic self. 




 My sincerest sympathies, my friend.  My thoughts are with you this morning. 




 But the savings on "product" makes it so worth it. 














 Apparently :D 





























 r/titlegore 









 Anger and resentment are the chief offenders in relapse. 




 Good for you! 




 I describe this self-insight as that moment when I crossed the line from someone who is stopping drinking because it makes sense in light of all the bad consequences; to the ex-drinker who truly values my new sober life.  At this moment in my experience, cravings left me.  As long as I keep putting one foot in front of the other, I am confident I will not drink again. 














 Did you participate in the making of this video?  Hmmmmm... 
























 I will not drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; sober in Cleveland again this morning and off to Starbucks to read the New York Times.  Have a great day, everybody! 









 Cedar Point is an hour from my house.

 The wisdom of labeling alcoholism a disease is this central concept; we have an effective treatment for which we OURSELVES are empowered to address by our daily choices and participation in recovery. 














 So /u/field__notes did you ever read through the [Baby Steps post?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  It's what I do everyday to stop drinking for TODAY, only.  Why not join us on the daily check-in tomorrow morning?  We can all start stopping together. 




 Good luck.  Working with others is the best way to get and stay sober.   




 Welcome /u/titty_sprinkz --thank you for sharing your thoughts about Fernando.  Somebody once pointed out to me that our eyes don't see inward, we need to look to others for our own reflection--that sounds like what you did so powerfully in speaking of Fernando.  So I stopped drinking and I got sober by doing the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Maybe something there will be helpful to you.  Good luck. 




 Absolutely, I didn't mean to pre-empt the debate, but merely lay out my thoughts on the one topic he mentioned in his post.   




 Wow you are in a dark place if I'm reading your post correctly.  I see myself 6 years ago, in your account of where alcohol has you.  I had to get help and stop drinking in order to find true happiness, and my authentic self.  Sustained sober time was an answer to the lies that alcohol was telling me and I got sober doing the simple actions I detail in the [Baby Steps post at this link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Let me be clear: I can't be happy drunk when drunk I text others about suicide. That simply is not rational and I suspect you know it or you wouldn't be posting here.  Good luck and keep posting and commenting. 




 Congratulations, /u/Hollow_Ponds -- an invite to join us on /r/dinos will shortly follow unless one of the other DINO mods beat me to it. 




 I just suggested in a comment to another post that the 90 day no drink challenge might be a way to gain some clarity on the issue you're grappling with.  The way I stopped drinking was via [the things I discuss at the Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Why not see if you can arrive at your own answers by simple sober actions for some sustained time without alcohol? 




 If I were you, I would stop drinking for some time, maybe set a goal of 90 days in order to gain clarity around my relationship with alcohol.  I found that my problem wasn't the 3rd or 4th beer or drink, but the first.  My way of stopping goes right to the heart of that problem:  [the Baby Steps are focused on learning how to stop drinking in the here and now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you. 









 It's interesting, almost the entire medical and psychological communities agree that alcoholism is a disease; but, the occasional dissenter when given voice in popular media or by Penn   Teller tends to animate the debate.  It's like the anti-vaxxer-thing in my opinion.  So why is alcoholism NOT a disease in their opinion?  Well, for a variety of reasons almost all of which are highly debatable--but, the big one is: you can't "catch" alcoholism like you can AIDS or Dengue Fever or Small Pox.  But alcoholism isn't an infectious disease (although if you think about it, maybe it is to some extent)--alcoholism or the disorders that we conventionally think of as alcoholism is more like diabetes or heart disease.  Our early life choices, and our genetic predispositions often bring on the disorder.  As far as I am concerned, I may not be responsible for getting my "disease" but I am wholly responsible for daily treatment. 














 Why don't you talk about those things you don't know whether you agree with on this subreddit?  At least we can supportively discuss the issues with you. 




 infrequently 




 Good for you, you have a real running start on a whole new way of living.  Solid insight about the reach of this "disease." 




 I suppose this would be surprising if anyone truly believed that Breitbart was anything more than a crew of rightwing grifters pretending to be hard hitting political journalists. 




 I'm upvoting you. 




 I'll bite, what? 




 How much did you donate? 














 Actually pretty descriptive. 




 Kasich did the same thing in Ohio (it must be an ALEC initiative)--give tax dollars to a secretive bunch of corporate oligarchs ostensibly to "create jobs."  Sweet deal.
