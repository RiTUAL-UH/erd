 I seriously just went through this maybe 15 minutes ago, I get a snapchat from my buddy who I know the girl I'm crushing on likes, and he likes her. And the snapchat was just her face, meaning they were hanging out together. Identical reaction as the gif. 




 Your girlfriend is 12 congrats 




 It does seem they are trying to trick us into thinking Vogel is the good guy, but I think she's the true villain over all. She is so okay with the killers, and she was the one taking Zach home, Dexter had some sex, then Zach was dead, and it showed Vogel with the brain. I think she's a bad guy.

 My family walked into this exact restaurant. The waitress said we would be dining with another group of seven, at the same table.

 I had a girl sleep in my bed last night; We didn't do anything sexual but I spooned with her until she left around 10 AM. Once she left, I fell back asleep and dreamed I ejaculated which lead to me cumming in real life. I know it wasn't on purpose, but when I woke up and realized what happened I felt as bad as if I had reset my badge for real. I feel weak and disgusting, and I know it doesn't count as fapping but it sure felt like it. Has anyone else experienced this after a streak of a few weeks? What mindset can help me feel less weak?

 First offence OWI, I'm 18 in Des Moines and blew a .134 outside of my house. I spent 12 hours in jail and the bail was $1300. I'm really worried because I'm moving to Indiana for college this Wednesday but my court date is next Monday, will I have to take classes in Des Moines or can I do those in Indiana? Also should I get a lawyer? My charges are Operating While Intoxicated- 1st offence, and driving left of center line.

 I think you could put money around 50 or so. We bet my friend he couldn't eat 15 single hamburgers in 45 minutes but him winning meant he didn't have to pay for the hamburgers. It was a lose lose situation, he only got 10 in and had to pay $15 
























 The hardest I've cried since I was a child was two weeks ago when I learned my best friend, the first person I met in college, took his own life. He went back to his hometown one night to go to a dentist appointment the next morning and never came back. When I texted him the next day his brother called me and said he saw I texted Anthony's phone and that I deserved to know what happened. Turns out his mom came home that morning to find him crying in the shed with a gun in his mouth. After she tried to pull the gun away, he put the gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. I don't even want to be at this college anymore, the only person I spent time with is gone.

 How could Dexter spend 8 seasons becoming more human, connecting to his son only to leave him with a different murderer? And do you think Deb shooting you at the end of season 7 would have been a more bittersweet ending?  




 Hey Michael! 

I've read that many of the scenes from Dexter had little improvisations you put into them, were there any memorable instances where the directors told you you went too far with yourself and crossed the line between Dexter and you? 

Also are John Lithgow's eyes less creepy in person?

 During high school I took them every night for a couple of years to counter the ADHD meds I was on. They work because they make you want to be tired, they feel like natural sleep is on its way if you lay down and relax. When I got to uni I stopped taking adderall except for special occasions so I stopped taking melatonin every night, and I can still sleep and I can nap like a fuckin' champ too. No insomnia my friend.

 I meant to mention in my post that whether it's true that fapping has anything to do with testosterone, I've placebo'ed myself into the position I'm in now. And I love it and hate it.  




 Absolutely, the benefits are fantastic. Usually. I don't want to sound like one of "those people" but working out, even at all, will help you let that energy out and sleep much better, I promise :) 




 Why didn't Helen Keller scream when she fell off the cliff? She was wearing mittens. 




 I've been on easy mode for a about 2 months now, and I'm going to have to switch to hard mode. The super powers are real, and I've known for a few years but I seem to forget until after going over a week without an orgasm. I don't know about you guys, but I've known about the super powers for about 4 years now, ever since I saw one picture that said not orgasming for a week can double your testosterone levels. It's as if reading that picture made that a real fact. I've tried telling people about how horrible and weak I feel the days after fapping, and they've told me they fap with no such feelings. So whether this feeling we get after fapping is real or just made in our heads, one thing is for sure. The super powers are more than real. Orgasming in general has begun to make me feel weak, and casual sex with girls I'm not into is beginning to lose its thrill because I know how weak it'll make me feel. I'd rather go a week without an orgasm and lose my social anxiety altogether rather than have one night flings every week. Right now, right now is the first time I've hit the week mark without an orgasm, even if I haven't fapped in 2 months. And this is the first time I've felt the powers of testosterone. I hope this helps you fapstronauts who aren't feeling the super powers yet but haven't switched to hard mode, it's worth it.
