 Only the finest of zerg cuisines. 




 Whoa, that's like a day after my birthday.  Talk about an awesome birthday present. 




 Don't forget derping the derps 




 **C'MON CRANKY, TAKE IT TO THE FRIIDGE** 




 "I'm a man too you know.  I go pee pee standing up!" 




 JAAAAYSUUUUN!! 




 So you're telling me that they just noticed the adopted part [in the wheatley arc?](/spoiler)  I'm sorry you parents are offended by the adopted part, but can I just say that they're a biiit slow? o_o  considering GLaDoS mentions it a bunch of times before 




 Welp, I am now mentally invigorated 
























 The reason they make noise is because invisibility. 




 I say just ask for spread sauce.  It's almost the same as animal style 




 SC2 Heart of the Swarm...And zerg gets the least amount of updates.
Well isn't that full of iron. 




 and that's just their apm 




 I like elevator music 




 it's back up guys. next game though. on shakuras plateau o_o 




 SO IT WASN'T JUST ME 




 You should be able to watch the stream through combatex's viewpoint somewhere on youtube. 4 parts 
























 Go to foreign country, wouldn't be considered foreign anymore 




 (9/10 btw, its the best portable KH to date)

You gotta go denouttaden

 Any sports besides basketball goes up

 Reminds me of [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/iv2ag/the_feeling_i_get_whenever_someone_redirects_me/) 




 within...World 1-1 




 reddit + skyrim 
























 Ah, sorry.  I should've probably made the text bigger or put it in the title.  I put in that I preferred the game wasn't an FPS or a MOBA.  I agree with you fully though that those are pretty great games. 




   
**Preferably not FPS or a MOBA.**  
Also here are some games I already own and played with others:  
-Monaco   
-Trine 2   
-Hammerwatch 




 Role play 




 Stinky hat  




 "THAT'S A LOT OF NUTS " 




 a hammer 




 Voltar, just because he's a support doesn't mean he's not capable of handling himself. Especially late game.

Getting this for my cousin 




 Guillermo del totally okay with that? 
























 Also went to that high school.  The fact that Snoop used to go there is one thing I like to brag to my friends about.  
  
Fun fact: People usually don't give a damn when I mention it... 




 No plans of going there then?  




 I was hoping that everyone would be discouraged to go therefore less people will go. I can dream 




 Anyone around the San Jose best buy? As of now I know it hasn't started yet but let me know how the lines are 




 We can and I would encourage the community to form opinions.  The only thing is that we shouldn't be too critical of the product.  If anything it's another flavor of smash to play, not everyone's cup of tea but it's something.  And if nintendo is really pushing forth this whole ideal of bridging the smash community I would bet that patches are going to be a very prevalent part of this game.  




 Too lazy to make a Conker game, make it yourself. 




 How easy is it to pick up and play torchlight 1 for someone who doesn't have any experience with ARPGs  




 Sadly yes :/ 
























 I'm liking the new interface and all but Nintendo really needs to step up when it comes to naming their products. I bet there's going to be a good amount of disappointed children getting the regular 3ds model because of uninformed parents.  




 SHIRT RIPPAH 




 So Lucina is basically going to be Marth for beginners? 




 In regards to the other characters as alternate costumes, you might be mistaking sakurai with the PMBR team.  At least I don't remember sakurai stating that. 




 tanks you 




 But the thing is snow also agreed she looked familiar  




 The only complaint that I would have to make with this.  
[Spoiler](#s "Bigby mentions in his first meeting with Faith(which was before meeting Nerissa) was that he feels like she had a sense of familiarity to her.  Maybe the realization might be what you said but what irks me still is what was the connection of his initial familiarity with Faith")  
Correct me if I got anything wrong. 





























 Bless nintendo and wanting touch screens on their shit 3 




 because we're desperate and people take advantage of that 




 Help a Blind man out, NA code for a couple of steam games I'm willing to offer because I can't play cause I'm blind 




 I'm trading some steam games for NA demo code, pm me if interested in trade 




 codes? :D 




 ayyyyy lmao 




 Haha I guess that's what I'm trying to get at, what in the game is considered a projectile and what's not.  Also it says in the description for RBAY "Reflects **most** enemy projectiles during tornado" so I figured there were some exceptions.  I'll add the clarifications on my original post 




 EDIT: I guess what I'm trying to ask is what is considered a projectile in Awesomenauts and what's not, also in the description of RBAY it states  
Reflects **most** enemy projectiles during tornado
