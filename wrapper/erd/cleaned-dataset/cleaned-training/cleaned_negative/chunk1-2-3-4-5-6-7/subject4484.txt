 Whoa, so that's what [Carl's watching in Up](http://youtu.be/Fu7h2Jb7XOo).
Awesome. 




 Don't the vast majority of fish use external fertilization, though? In the scenario you described, the eggs wouldn't develop...

 [Similar](http://www.freewebs.com/calhobbes/ch920610.jpg), and equally as funny. 




 Less than 2 hours until launch, should be fun to [watch](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html).

 It's better explained in the book.
But not much better. 




 If that's the tiger fish, it ended up dying and being carried off by a bunch of kids who didn't seem to want to eat it.
Made me real sad, beautiful fish. 




 Might be by Quino... 
























 I honestly don't think it will be that much more noticeable just because it's green, it's already very noticeable when it passes and very few people have ever seen it.

If you use mirrors, it will only be visible right after dusk and before dawn, just as it is now, hardly a constant reminder.

In the case of a light beam, very few people would see it as it points at them in the night,  you'll still need to know exactly when it's going overhead.

Just my 2 cents... 




 What we see when we look up at the ISS is light reflecting over all the surfaces it has, especially the solar panels, so it can usually be seen by a large area of land. A beam of light would be visible only to the people it's pointed at, and even then only barely, compared to the rest of the light coming from it.

I think you would see better results just by getting the message out on how to spot it. My mind was pretty thoroughly blown the first time I saw it, now I show it to people every chance I get. 

Edit: I guess that when the ISS is completely in the dark, you could see only the light if it's aimed at you, but it would have to be pretty darn powerful to be even slightly visible. 




 It would be much better to use big, possibly coloured, mirrors.

Which doesn't sound like very useful payload. 

I think the people who are inspired when they see the ISS passing overhead don't really care what color it shines. I personally don't, white is just as awesome to me. 




 They did translate it correctly. Well, not the conspiracy theorists, but the people who actually study the Mayan calendar. The Baktun does end on December 21, that's perfectly true.

It's funny that people use this "leap year" rubbish to dismiss the doomsday rubbish, as both sides would see they're wrong after 2 minutes of actual research. 




 I don't see how nuclear power can be "statistically safer" than solar power. 




 ["The Meaning of Liff"](http://folk.uio.no/alied/TMoL.html) by Douglas Adams has a great section on this, read from CORRIEARKLET to CORRIEMUCHLOCH. I tried copy/pasting but it turned into a huge mess.
 




 Why "from the Hobbit"? Will he be featured in the movie? He's my favorite character from the books (hence the username), would make me very happy to see him somehow squeezed into the movie. (I also immediately thought of him when I saw the picture, btw) 




 You can find them [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/lastchancetosee/sites/radio/). I listened to them a long time ago, but when I try now I get the message "not available in your area". Hopefully it works for you. I try to get my hands on everything related to Last Chance to See, there's also a cd-rom with all the pictures they took that I managed to get my hands on recently. 




 Exactly, I personally dislike well-done meat, but I just can't understand the people saying "he got what he asked for." You certainly can make a well-done steak without burning it. I also hold nothing against people who like it that way, it's their tasteless meat, not mine. 




 I think the parenthesis is referring to the pilot that tried to ram him. I might be wrong, though, the sources don't help. 




 Followed a few links and got to [this](http://youtu.be/09GLj6fq-wg).
Kinda crept me out at around 0:32, had my headphones pretty loud. 
























 Thanks, so is [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O4EPHA/ref=noref?ie=UTF8 psc=1 s=electronics) the cable that I need?

I'll still look at some guides before I pull the trigger, don't want to mess this up. 




 Trying to build a gaming PC, basically used Logical Increments to come up with:

The only things I can remember that I didn't take from LI were the RAM and optical drive, are those 2 alright? Any other comments on the parts are also highly appreciated.

The thing I'm most concerned about in the build are the cables, I get pretty lost when people start hooking everything up in the videos I watch. Is it easy to find clear instructions in the manuals? And most importantly, do I need to buy any cables, or are they all included with the parts? (the optical drive is what got me worried)

Thanks for any help. 




 WHO THE FUCK IS TOM BOMBADIL?

"He fucking is," said Goldberry. 




 And the lighthouse is [Farol da Barra](http://i.imgur.com/lLsqK.jpg) :) 




 That's the [National Congress of Brazil](http://i.imgur.com/AfX7k.jpg). 




 Anyone familiar with the guy playing Beorn? One of my favorite characters, and I always pictured him as a huge lumberjack sort of guy, not sure that actor looks the part. 




 I've only seen the the 100 in black, [like so.](http://www.absolut.com/content/products/images/absolut100/bottleImage.jpg) I have one of those around somewhere. 




 I can't find anything with that name, is it [this one](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/16925-PLUGIN-PART-0-17-Aviation-Lights-v1-0?highlight=lights)?

 




 [Here's my Saturn V-inspired build](http://imgur.com/a/VFFax). As you can see, it was pretty tried and true on the Mun, always had enough fuel to make it back. Got me to Eve just by adding a bunch of boosters and one or two small modifications (though that lander was a one-way trip). 




 Patcher wasn't working for me, either.

But 0.17 finally appeared on the download page and it's been going pretty fast so far, seems like the best way to get it. 




 I personally like using [Heavens Above](http://www.heavens-above.com/).

If you want to see other satellites, I live in a pretty bright suburb and I don't bother with anything above a magnitude 1 (the lower the better). 
























 Diamond is the aircraft manufacturer that makes the plane in the picture. They also make one called the Katana, but it's not this one (it's a Twin Star).

To further explain, air traffic control sometimes replaces the first letters for the name of the manufacturer. 




 The only things that need fixing in that game are a shortcut to take things out of your bag and longer days. 

Other than that, the game is perfect, especially the music. 




 I'm... not correcting myself. It is near the horizon at sunrise, my first post wasn't wrong. 




 Yeah, it rises at sunset and sets at sunrise. My window is to the west so I see it setting at sunrise. 




 I only picked it up because I recently moved to an apartment where my bedroom window faces the west. I woke up one morning with the full moon near the horizon at sunrise and thought "oh yeah, that makes sense." 




 Just go [here](http://www.youtube.com/account), there should be a link to disconnect it from G+ right bellow your e-mail.

No need to delete your youtube account like the other guy said. 




 I think the biggest giveaway is that HL3 would make everyone change focus from all the Steam Box stuff, which they clearly put a huge effort into. That would be just a bad business plan.  




 Administrative assistant is just a fancy term for secretary/receptionist, in most cases. 




 It is, just got the notice I have premium today. 




 Great, thanks. 




 I'm doing my first build and intended to get my Windows 8 from Dreamspark, but at the checkout I see this message:

*c.  Using Windows Desktop Operating Systems.  Your DreamSpark Direct Subscription includes certain Windows operating system products. You may install these products only on a computer that is already licensed to run a full version of a Windows operating system on it, as evidenced by a valid Certificate of Authenticity (COA) for a Windows operating system affixed to the computer.*

Does that mean I can't use it for a build?
 
























 If you scroll down to the variants, there were many multi-seat versions.

Fun fact: that "little" plane could carry as many lbs in bombs as a B-17. 




 Especially the guy taking a [drag on his cigarette](http://i.imgur.com/l9i2rwE.jpg). 




 [Damn you!](http://i.imgur.com/alf2XYL.png)

Getting that was a bit of a relief, I was a bit addicted to the game, but after that I just closed the tab and never went back. 




  However, their ancestor, the Elasmotherium, could be.

Thanks for posting that, I love reading about cool animals I'd never heard of before. 




 If anyone was wondering, the restaurant they eat at is called Figueira, here's a picture:

http://i.imgur.com/PdWIWIV.jpg

Don't know why they randomly decided to recreate that one, but it was pretty nice to see. 




 It's still as[ colorful](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/51/Newreal.jpeg) as ever, but for some reason they used R$200 bills, which don't exist. 




 Brazilian here, thought it was hilarious just like last time.

But yeah, people are going to complain, even though all the stuff about corruption, for example, is perfectly true. 




 I had something like 101% on his class because of all the extra credit he gives, and it's all just "bubble in alternative A on question 1 and hand it in".

His tests are based off the chapter outlines you can find on the editor's website, so you don't even need the book. Just be prepared to memorize a lot of stuff. 




 One of my favorite books, love collecting things from it.

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/JIHf16Z.jpg) a nice shot of Adams and a Kakapo from the CD-Rom. 




 Isn't it even 6 books, two per volume?

6 books into 3 movies, then 1 book into 3 movies. They really went overboard with that. 




 Not close at all, I don't know what he meant by "the other rover," but it was all Opportunity's doing. The article mentions Curiosity but doesn't really explain how its picture helped solve the rock mystery. 
























 I only recline my seat if the person in front of me has reclined theirs. If I couldn't recline mine because the guy behind me used that thing I'd be pretty pissed/uncomfortable. It's a pretty douchey solution.

I like the new approach some airlines are taking of having all seats in a set position. 




 
 Higher speeds can be attained if the skydiver pulls in his or her limbs (see also freeflying). In this case, the terminal velocity increases to about 320 km/h (200 mph or 90 m/s), which is **almost** the terminal velocity of the Peregrine Falcon diving down on its prey.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity

They still have the edge. 




  but they also know this type of protest draws a lot of attention from the media and is a way to show the discontent of the population.

Exactly, I don't understand this posture of "stop protesting and just enjoy it now that it's going to happen." If anything, now is the time to show the world how unhappy we are about this decision to host the games, otherwise the people responsible for it are just going to say "see? everyone loved it in the end." 




   It seems like the only people who were upset by it were white people.

Where did you get this from? The article doesn't mention the race of the people who were upset, and the woman who is defending the lecture is just described as "married to an African American," meaning she's probably white herself. 




 That's the one. I'll see if I can post the article to the subreddit when I finally get it. 




 Weirdest thing, after making that post I went in search of it like I've done countless times and actually found it on ebay!

I didn't have an issue number, just [this image](http://i.imgur.com/ZyPecue.png) from the Stephen Fry documentary. 

Can't wait for it to arrive, today was a good day. 




 Nice!

I have a bit of an obsession with Last Chance to See, myself. Only thing I'm missing in my collection is the original Observer Colour Magazine that led to DNA writing the book. If anyone has any clue as to where I can find it, I'd really be thankful. 




 Yep, Green-headed.

Had never heard of the Beryl-spangled, real beautiful. 




 It's a Green-headed tanager.

[Some more pictures.](http://www.wikiaves.com.br/midias.php?t=s s=11593) 




 The Tanager family has some ridiculously beautiful birds. [This one](http://i.imgur.com/RTR5n1w.jpg) is my favorite. 




  It often migrates by night, using the stars to navigate.

Woah, that's cool. How does something like that even evolve? 
























 I remember that the lady you give those things to also says something like "will you give me cancer?" when you talk to her.

I will finish you someday, FF9! 




 Yep, [the guy whom the TC didn't even credit.](http://capybarasthatlooklikerafaelnadal.tumblr.com/) 




  is usually enough to make people re-evaluate and jump down the rabbit hole

Exactly what happened to me, I had only ever listed to The Piano Has Been Drinking and didn't really care for it. Now I'm listening to Closing Time and it's pretty great. It's free on Amazon Prime Music, for anyone who wants to listen. 




 Paul McCartney was swarmed by these things when he was in Brazil.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68T_XeFS_08

He's a braver man than I am.
 




 Firefox also gives me the "This Connection is Untrusted" message. Weird.  




 The user you just linked to is a different one, the one in this thread has an uppercase i as his L, which makes it less impressive. 




  since even with his newest system it's relatively slow compared to speaking

That's an understatement, he can type one word per minute with his current system ([source](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21323-the-man-who-saves-stephen-hawkings-voice.html#.U586J7GJR5Y)) 




  if he had no texting in middle school then he's probably at least 30.

25 here, can't remember anyone who even had a cellphone in middle school.  




 I got my private pilot's license after years of playing flight sim. It definitely helped me feel comfortable in the cockpit, as I was already familiar with most of the instruments, knew a good deal of the terminology used by pilots, and even knew the basics of traffic patterns and such. Actually flying the plane was more of a learning experience, you just don't have the same feedback from the controls in the sim. The yoke doesn't get yanked to the side in a gust of wind or get really heavy during landing in sims. But still, I can say that even in that aspect the sims definitely helped me prepare. 




 Euros *per kilogram*. So you can safely be damn sure. 




 I read it as "not cican" so I put that into Google to see if it was a reference to something and it said "Did you mean: not clean?" Google is getting too smart.
