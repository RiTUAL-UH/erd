[Here's how to become a Poll Worker](https://vote.franklincountyohio.gov/poll-worker/)

If you want to be a poll worker, make sure you've declared your party affiliation, because some positions require an equal balance of Ds and Rs -- for example, when the actual ballots are delivered to the BOE after the polls close, each car making that delivery must have one of each. 










































































 [FAIRHealth Consumer Cost Lookup](http://fairhealthconsumer.org/index.php) can tell you, based on your zip code and the medical procedure codes, what a medical or dental procedure *should* cost, and how to navigate through the reimbursement process. Here's how this invaluable site came to be:

In 2009, an investigation by then-New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo uncovered conflicts of interest in one system that health insurers used to calculate reimbursement for patients who received care from providers outside their plans network. As a result of this investigation, FAIR Health -- an independent, not-for-profit corporation -- was created to establish and maintain a new database that could be used to help insurers determine their reimbursement rates for out-of-network charges, and provide patients with a clear, unbiased explanation of the reimbursement process. 

As part of the collective settlement the Attorney Generals office reached with the insurers, FAIR Health received millions of de-identified healthcare claims that many had used to help them determine their rates.  This data continues to be analyzed and processed with the goal of increasing its completeness, accuracy, and neutrality, as it will form the basis of our licensed products. The data is also the basis of educational products and tools for consumers made available on this website. 



















































































































































































 She's old (19, spayed), but has been in good health until this afternoon, when she started peeing pink in the bathtub and I immediately made a vet appt. for tomorrow afternoon. After a couple of hours I got her to eat (heartily, Science a/d that we had on hand) and drink, and she went to sleep for a couple of hours. But since she woke up a two hours ago, all she's done is try to pee, with almost no success. She's walking back and forth to the litter box, then crouching there, shaking her tail. She produced a small amount of clear liquid, then nothing. She's miserable.

Other things that might be at work here: she's had an impacted anal sac (6 mos. ago) and does suffer intermittent constipation; the vet says she has small kidneys but hasn't done tests to find out why.

Is this situation dangerous? Is there anything I can do before morning to make her more comfortable?

Thanks in advance for any help of any kind.

 Columbus residents are fortunate to have curbside recycling -- but how well are we doing it? I thought I was being good by saving even scraps of clean cardboard and paper, washing out food containers before putting them in the bin, etc. But then I saw that a friend is saving every plastic bag (although I don't know where she plans to take it), and now I wonder. Do you 

-- empty and wash jars at the back of the refrigerator with contents that have turned into slimy science experiments?
-- tear apart pizza boxes to save the clean cardboard?  
-- refuse styrofoam takeout containers?  
-- use only cloth kitchen towels, rather than paper?  

Bonus question:
Do you urge your friends and relatives to work harder at recycling?

And of course:
Why or why not? 






































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 I've worked the polls in Ohio for several years, but Columbus has turned decisively blue, and local Dems are more active by the day. So by waiting too long -- a few hours! -- to respond to the BOE's call for workers, I lost out on getting one of the slots reserved for Dem poll workers.

May other pollworkers here also find themselves facing such an embarrassment of riches! 






































































































































 At 4 AM, driving on Sawmill was dicey at best, with visibility of less than 20 feet. Route 161, with no street lights and few residential or commercial light sources, was frankly terrifying. It looked like east Tennessee out there.

 oooh, scary! 




 [I see what you mean.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Will_Rock_You_%28musical%29#Critical_reception) Glad I missed it. 




 It probably will. The volume of submissions here is overwhelming. You might want to post it to /r/cats, which is lower-traffic, higher quality (because it asks for original content) or /r/catpictures. I *know* others there will appreciate it. 




 It really is a great pic! You can almost feel his excitement, sniffing the wild air ...

So many of the posts here are lazy, sloppy cellphone snaps of cats asleep on the OP's lap. But this one really stands out, and hopefully may inspire other redditors to try to capture images that more clearly convey their cat's adventures and emotions. 




 Wash your mouth out!

EDIT: OMG, you're speaking about a real possibility. I thought you were making a sick joke. 




 This is one reason why I love reddit, warts and all. 




 Animals and kids know: Everything is food until proven otherwise. 




 I don't think it's even possible to make Freddie Mercury boring. 




 I don't believe this kitten is that old. It looks to be *maybe* six weeks old. 




 Great photo! I'm sure Bruce had a wonderful time -- but shouldn't he wear a collar if he's going out alone? 




 Cute enough for /r/corgibutts ?

 You just said more about yourself than about anything I wrote. 




 You're not even reading your own comments correctly. 




  this poll omits Elizabeth Warren

Who will. not. run.

Why do people persist in this fantasy? 




 She's one BIG kitty! That's about three times the size of my oldest. 




  In the case of pets and children: they're stupid.

Not stupid; they just can't read. Also, it's sweet, and apparently tastes good. Do you happen to know if this treatment works for animals? 




 How much does she weigh? (How much of that fluff is fur?) 




 [And this doesn't help.](http://www.boston.com/news/nation/2015/05/01/news-media-won-cover-bernie-sanders-because-news-media-won-cover-bernie-sanders/Fd4VrpGvVqhACVdPuVjOlM/story.html) 









  ... years of "divisive rhetoric" made the violent phrasing seem normal.

So much for editorial judgment. 









 It might help to leave the radio on, tuned to a good classical music station. That seems to keep our cats happy. 




 The nearest [Rent-a-Wreck](https://www.rentawreck.com/cheap-car-rental-akron-OH.htm) is in Akron, but it's worth a call and might be worth going that far to pick up depending on rates. 




 True. But I posted this because I think the dynamic cited in the headline is a real problem, and not just on the Sanders campaign. I've been in this business along time, and the amount of self-censorship I see today based on what's assumed to be the consensus about what's worth covering is quite alarming. I think it's partially a function of overvaluing what readers want, rather than an editorial vision of what readers need to know.  




  I hate Kroger. 

If all you've seen are their stores along High Street or in student/poor neighborhoods, that's understandable. But go look at one of their best Marketplace stores and try to say that again. The variation in quality is infuriating, but they do have some very good stores.

 I wasn't sure where to ask this in general

You might also ask at /r/Pets and /r/Dogs to get more opinions. 




 "Good Sam" funds -- which are donations from wealthier clients -- are never advertised, and are used at the discretion of  the vet. I've had good luck with just being upfront at the first appointment about the fact that we have almost no money. 

I hope you will be able to get him in sooner than later, because while this could be a big nothing, it could also be an upper respiratory infection. 

Adding, I once found a filthy, scrawny white kitten so close to death that we named him Spike (after Buffy's undead boyfriend). With a little help from an understanding vet, we saved his tiny life -- and he's now a big, robust 9 year old! So please come back and show us photos of your kitten once he's feeling all better. 




 I know how you feel. But he will always be part of you. Maybe [this](http://img1.etsystatic.com/000/0/6011550/il_fullxfull.330687981.jpg) will be of some comfort. 









 So sorry for your loss. What was this handsome fellow's name?

 One of the nicest things about cats is that -- unlike  everybody else you run into day to day -- they *just don't care* about money. 




 *Somebody* doesn't like the outdoors.

 For whoever reported this comment: it isn't doxxing. It's public info about a public figure.

OTOH, it's also unnecessary, and because of that it looks like an invitation to harass. So let's keep such comments to a minimum, please.  














 Inspired, and based on the book, by Ghiglieri, M. P. and Myers, T. M. (2012) Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon, this map is presented in Chromadepth and is best viewed with Chromadepth 3D glasses. 









 All true. Every defendant has the right to the assumption of innocence, and to a vigorous defense at trial. But usually this level of comment from defense counsel is saved for the trial, rather than trying the case in the press by blaming the victim.

This particular lawyer, whose bread and butter is DUI cases, has a long-standing obsession with the way consent is defined. Is it ideological? Is it a career move? I don't know, but I do think this interview is over the top. 

 




 Reyes' attorneys are calling the women opportunists.

"What police failed to mention is that the victims were present during the game, called to Mr. Reyes, waited for him after the game," defense attorney Brad Koffel told the judge Tuesday. "They went out and had drinks afterwards. They voluntarily went up to his hotel room."

**None of which matters.** What year is this, anyway?  




 They mean packing material (from appliances), not food containers, but it's a start.

And no, I have no idea what they plan to do with it. But at least it won't be available for my demented feline to keep chewing on, and that's what matters right now. 









 Not sure there's any right way, given [this guy's bias](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate/comments/347opv/xpost_rtia_there_is_no_such_thing_as_a_small_fat/). 




 This bitter 111-day strike was more closely-watched than most strikes in the US because it was so violent and so disruptive to business. [This article puts the strike in context](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2006/01/mine-j25.html), detailing the history of both the industry and the union, in a way that other, less "biased" sources can't match.  









 In 1985, the strike by meatpackers at Hormel's Austin MN plant, represented by United Food And Commercial Workers Local P-9, was the cause celebre of the labor-oriented left in the US, gaining wide support nationally from everyone to the left of Ronald Reagan. Only a handful of trade unionists and labor activists disagreed with the strategy of the local, which pitted it against the national union as well as the bosses. P-9 supporters were outraged by the criticism, which history has vindicated. The dispute has long-lasting implications for all labor organizing, and deserves the closer look it did not get at the time.

The linked piece was written while the strike was ongoing, but it remains the most complete explanation of the issues. It's a very long read, but the key graf is this one:

The outcome of the struggle between industrial unionism
and enterprise unionism will determine the nature of the labor movement in decades to come. Concessions can be won back in later bargaining, as many unions have shown. But a fundamental shift to enterprise unionism will destroy whatever class consciousness still exists in the labor movement. 









  I think you're just hating on radicals for no reason, frankly. 

I can't read past this. You clearly have no idea how absurd that assumption is, but you should have caught a hint by now. 




 Yes, and that's one reason why I don't want to be the submitter there. 




 This is a noble effort, but it's unlikely that backpack was left there by its owner, don't you think? It's more likely that you found a pack that had been ripped off and discarded by the thief after everything of value was removed. If there was mail in it, it presumably showed a street address -- is there any possibility that you could take the further step of going back to the bridge, getting the pack and taking it to that address? Even if it's soaking wet by the time you get there, I bet Abigail G. would rather have it than not! 




 You did the right thing. I'm just amazed that they took the hint! 




 No. If you recognized my username, you'd know it's true. I've had to get mods and admins involved on more than one occasion. Having me as OP on such a post would get it downvoted and turned into a flamewar.

Why would you *not* want to do it? 




  Did it occur to you that a lot of those people have the same sort of analysis of all this that I have? Because they do. 

I suspect that I have a better handle on who does this work nationwide than you do -- if we're talking about people who primarily build organizations and coalitions rather than people who turn out for demonstrations. In my experience, the latter group have almost no idea who the activists are *in their own cities*, let alone nationally, who have been working on this issue for decades. They often don't even know whether DOJ has had any previous involvement with police departments in their own state -- which is such basic ignorance it blows my mind. 

There are *plenty* of very radical people involved in the national movement for police accountability, but they are not anarchists. They are people who have learned the cost of letting the perfect become the enemy of the good, and they are not about to let that happen again.

DOJ intervention does make a difference. I live in a city that was forced into a settlement, and although there are still problems, policing here is nothing like it was before. It is literally a life and death difference for people here, so hearing you dismiss it as "an attempt to sap the energy of movements with shallow reformism" is incredibly insulting.

I don't think you and I will get any closer to agreement with further arguments here, but please, get to know the people who were on this case before you woke up. It will expand your political horizons and give you lots more leaders to respect.

  




 I'm not a good person to do it, for several reasons including the fact that I have a small posse of haters who follow me around reddit and downvote everything I post. So, please: lead on! 




 Extremely important question: how did you "send the dogs home"? Did you just tell them to go? I'd be afraid they'd insist on coming along for the whole trip. 




 Wouldn't it be a good idea to cross-post this to /r/OSU and /r/Columbus, if not also /r/Ohio? 




 [citation needed] 




 Tell that to residents of cities where long-term campaigns for accountability have made real differences. From your grand theoretical anarchist heights, you're trashing the work of thousands of community activists over many decades because you think your analysis of hierarchy is more important than their real life struggles for civilian review, better training and better policy.

You didn't say "give up" in so many words, but that was the clear message your vague rant delivered. 




 Ah, so we should just give up, then. I see. Well, thanks for dropping that "knowledge" on us. 

Anyone else? 




 Where'd you find that --Santa Barbara beach? 




 The operator end of a cat toy. 














 Yes, cats hunt. I was just making fun of the idea that domestic cats, not habitat loss, is responsible for large-scale bird loss.

You *can* teach her not to hunt, BTW. She's bringing you gifts, and if you make her understand that you don't want her to do that, she may stop. I've had best success with lecturing the cat: they absolutely hate being lectured. It's much more effective than a spray bottle. 




 Are you saying American soldiers in general today have an easier time in war, or that soldiers who ignored the warnings and went to Iraq anyway are less deserving than those who fought in a just war?  




  All I know is that I'm not anywhere fighting and other people are.

For *any* of the sacrifices made by American soldiers to mean anything, it's incumbent on *every* American to know and care about where and why that fighting is happening. Some wars are just, some are wars of aggression to control resources or trade. 

I really hope your comment was just overgeneralizing, not jingoism. 




 Why is that? The one time I tried to visit friends in Tucson, there were so many cockroaches in their otherwise nice house that we (native New Yorkers) couldn't sleep and fled the next morning, days ahead of schedule. What causes this level of infestation? 




 Wait: you mean it wasn't those evil domestic cats? 




 Er, somebody didn't bother to read the sidebar...

 You've completely misunderstood my meaning. I was saying your situation is the exception to my original comment about never, ever re-homing a pet. You're doing it exactly right, and I'm glad this kitty has a better home now.  




 Thanks for this. ISPCA's malfeasance has done a lot of damage to the reputation of all humane and welfare organizations. You've put the emphasis right where it belongs: on individual donors' responsibility to look this stuff up on Guidestar or Charity Navigator, but to keep on donating.

I found [this partial explanation of the differences](http://www.differencebetween.info/difference-between-aspca-and-spca) at the website most people will trust to tell them which is which. 

I have to wonder why this three year old article is suddenly floating around again now...

 




 What are you talking about?  




 None of which is surprising, since OP's submission history seems to be all about picking stupid fights.

 Moving across national borders is a special case, and arranging for a (possibly permanent) foster home for the duration is the best way to deal with it.  




 How nice for you that you had a good experience in a co-ed HS, just like millions of other girls. Now please stop attributing to me the ideas you want to argue against. Apparently, "YMMV" went right over your head.

I never suggested you "suffered'. The schools I spoke about are not the caricature you posit but (as I said) rigorously academic prep schools. 

You have a chip on your shoulder about this that no amount of discussion will fix. You'll have to find someone else to argue with.


 









 I wish I'd known to teach kittens while young to expect to get their nails trimmed, their teeth brushed and their ears cleaned on a regular basis for the rest of their lives.

But mostly, I wish everyone knew, before adopting a pet, that it's a lifetime commitment or it's nothing. Cats live to be older than many redditors reading this -- one of ours is turning 20 this summer. Pets are not props for a lagging social life, and they're not decor for a particular lifestyle. You don't "give away" pets when living with them becomes inconvenient. People who do this deserve sharp criticism, at best. 




 What will you do for them? Do you need info about how to care for baby kittens? 




 Yeah? You and what coalition? You show up here as a brand new anonymous account, throw out a call and expect anything to come of it? At best, this post is an insult to all the people who actually do the work necessary to *organize* the kind of mass movement that deserves support.

Mostly, though, it's just pathetic. 









 Some vets will give you a Good Samaritan discount if they know you've just rescued a stray -- it's worth asking. Also, look for rescue organizations in your general area, which may be able to help with this. Where are you located?

 Because of the subject, it feels uncharitable, but somebody has to say it: this post isn't extraordinary. Thousands of people have stories from that day, and this is far and away the least interesting one I've ever read. This reddit deserves higher standards for what constitutes a "gem". 














 Um, cute baby *what*? 




 What post is this a reply to? Where in the world is Henry?

EDIT: Never mind. This post is just incompetent spam from a new user whose only other post was also promoting one of her books -- but there, she remembered to include the name of the book and her website address. I'm reporting this as spam. 




 (1) Is your cat neutered? If not, do that ASAP.  

(2) When you go to open the door, only open it enough to put your foot in the opening, and use that and your voice ("Back! Back! Back!") to make sure the cat can't come through. You'll have to retrain *yourselves* to open the door differently, but once you learn it, he'll never get out again. [Source: eight years living with *five* escape artists.] 




 **GO TO THE VET NOW!** Not tomorrow; right this minute. This is a serious emergency -- that stuff is a nerve poison, and an overdoes could easily kill your cat.

 I have attended co-ed schools, so I do know the difference. I was just lucky enough to attend an all-girls school for the critical years when we were all hormonally deranged and socially insecure. If you had no problems in a mixed school, you're lucky. The  problems girls in co-ed schools have are of the sort that are hardest to see, because they consist of omissions: not being as assertive or competitive as they would if not competing for  approval from potential dates; not forming the same kind of intellectually-based friendships with other girls, etc.

EDIT: Adding, this is not just my opinion. There is plenty of research that has consistently found the same result over many decades: [single-sex school produce girls who are academically better prepared, more science oriented and more likely to continue their education.](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/graduates-of-all-girls-schools-85038)

 




 He loves you! My tiny calico used to bring home multiple snakes every spring, to the point where we had to put a sign on the inside of the front door cautioning everyone to beware of cats bearing snakes: if you didn't check before opening the door, she'd run right past you to deposit her "gift" in the middle of the LR floor. Once I took the same snake away from her multiple times, releasing it back into a ravine nearby, only to have her go find the damn thing and bring it back over and over. 

And the thing is, kitties are so *proud* of the gifts they bring that it's hard to get really mad at them for doing what they're born to do.
 




 Yes:  that's the imgur rip-off of the full story -- this is the original source. I saw that album on imgur, recognized that it *must* have come from some journalistic source, because it was too detailed and professionally shot to be just "some guy on the internet", and so went looking for the original source. As a journalist, I'm allergic to rip-offs that don't credit the journalists who did the work.

Oh, I'm sorry -- were you chastising *me* for failing to notice that this had "already been submitted"?

 One nonreligious group doing this is [**Feed The Streets**, a project of the group Pursuing Our Dreams](https://www.facebook.com/PursuingOurDreams). I like this one because it's grounded in a plan to grow community.

 I'm sorry for your loss. Baxter looked like a lovely friend.

This is a terrible way to learn it, but perhaps your experience can help others get the lesson that cats *always* freak out during a move, and need to be carefully monitored during the run-up and contained during the move itself. Four of my cats flipped out and fled while I was loading the car for the last bit of a move, and I had to stay behind for three days in an empty house before I was able to round them up. I was lucky that time, but I should have known better because it wasn't the first time I'd lost a cat while moving.

May all of us be extra careful with our fur friends hereafter, and may you be comforted by your memories of handsome Baxter.  




 That's not fiction. That's true. 




 ...and just for symmetry, here's a fan page that collects links to all the works of [Theodore Sturgeon](http://www.physics.emory.edu/faculty/weeks//misc/sturgeon.html), whose name and career [inspired the creation of Kilgore Trout](https://books.google.com/books?id=EvCsY3IEJ14C pg=PA173 lpg=PA173 dq=theodore+sturgeon+kilgore+trout source=bl ots=P10yCAL9a9 sig=0_TxLIKZSYrdXkicb8RhgzqyEKc hl=en sa=X ei=xvlcVfPbHYPksATw1YGQDQ ved=0CFoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage q=theodore%20sturgeon%20kilgore%20trout f=false). 




 So... nothing in [the last round of answers](http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1s5e19/good_guitar_tech/) worked out for you? 




  Once you get the footage, I'm not really sure what you would do with it...

Anybody who does this should remember that events like concerts and festivals usually prohibit commercial use of photos of those events, and there's a whole industry of researchers looking around online for images violating those bans. Plus, the big ones have major police presence (that includes OHP), which could bring unwanted attention to the drone operator.

 If you think it's not "what Columbus is all about", why not tell us what you think IS appropriate?

I sorta like it, but am open to change (as always).

EDIT: Having just looked at the two you suggested, I amend my view: our current header is much better than either one. 




 Do you have *any* idea how completely you're presenting as a stereotypical sophomore? There's a reason for the cliche that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. 

Anyway, go on about feeling superior. We're done here.

 




 AFAIK it's just a listing, although I suspect they wouldn't list any org with a seriously bad rep. 




 Okay then, as an editor trained as a lexicographer (in which field, what the public thinks *matters absolutely*) I say to you: 

It's a variant. Deal with it.

Anyway, don't you have homework to do? 




 [Columbus Dog Connection](http://www.columbusdogconnection.com/dog_cat_info.htm) can help you find vets, trainers, fence companies, dog-friendly apartments, insurance, food pantries, you name it. This is a rare and precious resource that deserves support. 




 If your car is new and high-end, you probably won't be stopped for this on city streets around central Ohio. Driving while poor is another thing altogether -- that's when "no front plate" becomes another pretext for stop and ticket in places like Worthington and Dublin. 




 It's a variant, as recognized here by at least two dozen redditors who upvoted it over the last two months. 




 I went to a prep school, not a Catholic school, and uniforms had been worn there since the founding. And our uniforms weren't just pieces you buy anywhere, they were made by one specific outfitter, so the price issue was even worse for students whose families were not rich. 

Still, I'm incredibly grateful for having attended a school where uniforms were required and academics were primary. (I'm also glad there were no boys around to confuse us about how smart we all were!) 




   I'm not a reformist so I don't bother myself too much with the impact of reforms.

The reform struggle is the real world that you live in, and it's filled with people who should have socialist politics (and very often do), so you'd do well to start taking notice. It's not selling out to recognize, appreciate and even work in reform struggles -- but not knowing the whole political terrain in front of you is a serious mistake. 




  Starting up with uniforms meant having no hand-me-downs

My school and many others had a "little shop" where students could buy used uniforms for exactly that reason. Socks and shoes were the only thing we didn't buy used. 




 Shift dresses, yes; miniskirts, no. It would have to have been *very* late 60s for those skirts to have such high hemlines. In the mid-60s, the rule in many schools was still that the hem had to touch the floor when the wearer was kneeling. (I have no idea where that standard came from, but it was everywhere.)

Anyway, another commenter has cited the original source as saying it was 1972, which looks exactly right to me. 




 This is one area in which we could take a lesson from Mississippi. Sometimes the old ways are just plain better.

  I read everything else below and think you are getting an unreasonable amount of shit for your post.

Thanks for your reply. I never meant to be rude but I was careless in my phrasing. I'm glad and proud that Columbus finally passed this law -- that's what I was trying to convey, but the way I said it completely undercut the intent.

You should also know that this sub has a reputation for being so brutal that it once was near the top of the list in a discussion of most toxic local reddits, and that in particular that I have a small posse of haters who downvote and disparage almost anything I say. That doesn't account for all the critical comments-- some were right on target about how unwelcoming my original comment was -- but a couple of those people hate me so much they'll come into a thread on /r/aww to snarl at me. So it's not all about this discussion.

Anyway, I hope you find what you're seeking here, and add that the weekly "Bar Thursday" gatherings listed in /r/ColumbusSocial are reportedly very friendly. I won't be there, because I don't feel welcome. 




 You did see that I apologized, right? And I didn't call names. 




 The relative is, for lack of a better word, delusional.

I don't know how close a relative this is, but you might want to consider the likelihood that what's happening with the dog now is a preview of what will happen with the human eventually. The ties you make or break within the family now may be even more important later...

I'm now convinced of your sincere concern for the dog, and wish for you all the best outcome, whatever that is.  




  vote in a new economic system 

Who suggested that? This whole thread is full of strawmen. 




  I wish you'd just give up being an asshole already. 

I'm being authentically me: sometimes wrong, but always willing to retract and self-criticize if that's truly the case. I can't do anything about your opinion of me (and I can't even judge you the way you judged me because your current account is only four days old), but I would politely suggest that the above language is way beyond the limits of how to maintain a healthy subreddit.

Adding, keeping one username for almost 8 years and never deleting mistakes is not easy, but you should try it. 




 Not really. I know a lot about Suprynowicz. The Drega killings happened in New Hampshire. But you did detect something there: the reason I paid extra attention to Dennis Joos and the Drega rampage when others were looking at Diana's death is that I was a journalist, too.

BTW, there's a new book about this coming out this summer from Beacon Press that may finally correct the public record about Drega. I've talked to the author, and it looks like it will be an excellent read. 




 [Here's the article announcing the naming of the wooly lemur, *Avahi cleesei*.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4427160.stm) 









 Once again, a [Dirty Fuckin' Hippie](http://www.cafepress.com/mf/22025047/dirty-fing-hippie-oval_sticker) gets it right. Thank you for that *moral* as well as strategic clarity. I can never understand the willingness of the theoretical purity crowd to throw away the tiny margin of political and survival space for the poorest among us, just for the sake of their own self-image as revolutionaries.  




 That's a grotesque distortion of the position taken by his critics. 




 The Review-Journal is unfortunately Nevada's largest newspaper, but the more reputable choice is the Las Vegas Sun.

What would be excellent is if you could never let anybody forget the Colebrook story, and Suprynowicz's role in its aftermath. The attacks happened before most people understood the danger of lone wolves motivated by Sovereign Citizen crackpottery, so a lot of people wrote it off as a singular event with no political significance. (It was also the week Princess Diana was killed, and that ate the newshole almost everywhere outside the affected local area.) But Supryowicz took this horror, turned it upside down and spent years touring the backwaters of the US using his book to mobilize anti-government RW crazies. 

More people should know about the reflexive heroism of another newspaper editor, Dennis Joos, who threw himself on Drega when he attacked the newspaper office. Joos was killed trying to save his staff and friends. The local library is now named for him.

All of which is by way of saying, too late, that deleting this post might not have been the best choice -- although I understand the logic. 




 hahahahaha 




 By a completely despicable "newspaper". This is the home base of Vin Suprynowicz (editor), who made his name by [championing the vile rightwing spree murderer Carl Drega](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/08/10/1230293/-Carl-Drega-Folk-Hero-to-Free-Staters). So don't get carried away by praise from these hate-mongers. 




 Another one! You should totally also post this cutie over to /r/catsinsinks. 




 Shhh! If the theoretical purity crowd hears you, you'll be drummed out of the ...oh, wait; there IS nothing they could ban you from, because they never build anything.

  Bernie Sanders is the only one who will be able to talk in this "mass arena"

...*IF* ultraleftists like you succeed in demobilizing thousands of young people who otherwise would be going door-to-door, writing letters to the editor, etc.  

Fortunately, I think your likely success rate there will be about the same as most of your posts here. Go back to /r/Maoism, will ya?  




 This case was not decided on the basis of anything about free speech.
 




 What this candidacy presents is a opening to talk in the mass arena at a level that hasn't been possible for at 40 years.

Well, that and an opportunity for some people to feel superior because they have a wee bit of theory, mostly without real world experience. 




 go away, idiot spammer.

reported. 




 by itself all day sitting in it's own piss. I'd qualify laying in your own piss as won't move. 

Okay. You didn't make that clear before.  But when you say it can't be solved within the family, I have to ask if the rest of you -- starting with whoever took the dog to a vet before -- can't do a *collective* intervention. This would have the effect of spreading around the responsibility, and might even make family relations go better in the long run.  




 [Here's what the same intersection -- Fifth Ave. at 27th Street -- looks like now.](http://lostnewengland.com/2014/05/looking-north-on-fifth-avenue-from-27th-street-new-york-city/)

This is a very cool website that does that for many old photos. 




 If that doesn't work, I'd resort to the universal fix: duct tape. 




 Why isn't your assistant busy doing comparative reviews of different brands of catnip?  




 If the pet is still eating, it's not time yet. When the pet stops eating and *won't* move (as opposed to having difficulty), that's the end. Until then it's at the discretion of the owner, for better or worse. It's not animal cruelty to be unable to say goodbye to a beloved friend, and your eagerness to report what should be solved within the family undercuts your asserted compassion. 

You might want to explain to your family member that many pets stay alive for their owners' sakes, and that past a certain point that's not really fair to the animal.

Finally, if the owner once allowed someone else to take the pet to the vet, would s/he allow a third professional assessment now? 




 That was *yesterday*. Read the rules. 




 Note that this was decided not on a free speech basis.  




 I'm so very sorry. That's not an export we're proud of.  




 Note that this case was *not* decided on grounds of free speech, but it's still going to cause problems. 









 ...but Breitbart is an American problem. 




   In a globalized world, there's always a place to escape consequences.

Not forever. The connection between wealth inequality and climate emergency is becoming clearer every day to those who are willing to see it. Those who refuse to see it will find themselves forced, one way or another, to confront that reality. I hope that realization comes at the point of a global popular uprising, not at the point of a global economic and environmental collapse. 




 Oh, come on. If you're being honest, you know that I give lots of help and information to /r/Columbus, which can't really be outweighed by politics that you don't happen to like.

 




 Go back and see the rest of my response. 




 Sorry it came out that way. But it's hard for smokers to understand that many of us could not go to *any* bar in Columbus until this law was passed. I missed almost the entire experience of [Stache's/Little Brothers](http://www.ootb646.com/columns_profiles/venues/littlebrothers.html) because of this, despite being a friend of the owner and a fan of many of the bands that played there.

I do appreciate your effort to be respectful, and rest assured that someone here will give the precise info you need. 




 What's judgmental is your overreaction.

You're about to adopt your first kitten and know so little about cats that you had to ask others what age to adopt and what to feed it. I've had to deal first hand for decades with the effects of people not neutering cats. I suggest that you step back, look beyond your personal scope of vision, and realize that this is a heartbreaking situation that I dealt with fairly politely.

EDIT: By "this is a heartbreaking situation" I meant the crisis of homeless cats, not this particular cat.  




 Welcome to Columbus, where we actually care about [the respiratory health of non-smokers](https://www.ohiobar.org/forpublic/resources/lawyoucanuse/pages/lawyoucanuse-503.aspx):

The new law applies only to enclosed areas. As that term is defined, however, it includes more than just indoor spaces. Decks or patios that are covered overheadby a roof or even umbrellas or awningsand on more than two sides are also enclosed under the law. Smoking is not allowed if members of the public are invited or allowed into these areas, or if anyone works there as an employee, an independent contractor, or even as a volunteer. Business owners still have the option of making their entire facilities non smoking, both indoors and out. 


 




 Yes, she is. Now imagine how much better she'd look lying in a soft bed in the safety of a home where the humans cared enough to have her spayed. 




 OP, do you really rely solely on redditors for your news? There are plenty of serious, competent news orgs offering breaking news 24/7, just a click away.
 




 Can't. They're almost all too relevant, even now. 

I grew up in a house where Adlai Stevenson was right behind Franklin Delano God in our parents' opinion. I was too young to quite understand why, but now I get it.

  Don't think they have the revolutionary drive to support massive change for their workers.

And they won't until there's more engagement and education within the unions -- which are, after all, pretty much all there is in terms of a class-conscious infrastructure in the US. Remember, unions have been the money and mobilizing force behind major struggles for civil rights and against unjust wars.

[Teamsters for a Democratic Union](https://www.tdu.org/) will be an important ally if you do get into this. 




 Believe it or not, I did not know he is a redditor. Thanks for that! 




 This is good: it's how you build a base for *eventually* standing up. And I can tell you from my own experience that denouncing them isn't the way to go. Asking pointed questions (to which you already know the answer) is a better lever for prying open closed minds.

It will help to study what the standards are in unionized plants, you can find out what's up in your area through Unitd Food and Commercial Workers.  




 Right. Not all mice carry the virus. 




 That is absolutely delicious! 




 So what did *you* say in this meeting?

What you're facing is Standard Operating Procedure -- and the reason it continues is precisely because so many retail workers see themselves as just biding their time until they can leave for some imagined better place. Stand in the place where you are, for what you believe in. There's no other way. 




 [Alley Cat Allies](http://www.alleycat.org/Kittens) can help you with every step of the decision, from assessing their age and degree of socialization to building an outdoor shelter or finding a rescue org. They can even help you [find out who in your area is working with feral cats](http://www.alleycat.org/FeralFriends), which may lead you to the individual who is feeding them. (Because this is dubiously legal in some municipalities, they may be working at night.)

You could also try posting in your local and state reddit communities to ask how to contact local feral cat caretakers.

One thing you can do immediately is make sure they have access to clean water. Sometimes feral cats are fed, but not given water -- and that's a big deal.

There are many, many people doing this work, all of whom will be happy to help. Good on you for wanting to help, and good luck! 




 She's looking for subcutaneous, not intravenous. Sub-Q is a standard treatment for feline kidney disease, but I dunno about a UTI.  




 Just go to the vet. The initial visit will cost about $50, the fluids and rig will cost about $25, and you'll go home *knowing*, not guessing, whether the problem is a UTI or (also possible) early CKD or something else altogether.

[Rascal Animal Hospital](http://www.rascalanimalhospital.com/pricing-information.html) is probably the cheapest -- it's a $15 surcharge for walk-in, added to the $30 comprehensive exam. But get there when they open, and expect to wait -- they're currently booking appointments for routine care about two months out. 




 Yeah, that's part of the problem. There are union democracy movements particular to many national unions, but most don't have a high enough profile to reach down to the local rank and file unless there happens to be a member who has wide general knowledge of and interest in unionism in general. Some such groups, like Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU) have been so well-established for so long that they have actually wrought major changes. I'd suggest that anyone who is a union member should go looking for their union's rank and file oppositionists, because there usually is help to be found. 




 ... and that's what the [union democracy movement](http://aud2.uniondemocracy.org/) is about. Too bad you didn't reach out to that faction in whatever union you belonged to. 




 What union pursues an *unsupported* grievance, with no basis in contract language? This is a serious question. That is not normal. 




 Or until enough collective action on many levels changes the whole paradigm away from individual rights to social justice. 




 It's more basic that that, even. Americans are taught to think of themselves as individuals and to distrust "collectivism". Until we get past that legacy of anti-communism, no call for change will work as well as it could.  




 [It isn't true, and they do have a choice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/37yx09/robert_reich_one_big_reason_america_was_far_more/crqz97x) 




  That is their job. they have to defend every single worker.

No it isn't, and no they don't. Not all complaints are legitimate greivances; the job of the union steward is to sort them out and decide whether/when to file a grievance.

The biggest problem workers have with unions is foot-dragging on filing and aggressively pursuing grievances. The most annoying problem for unions is members who don't bother to read the damn contract and thus either don't bother to seek redress or do so for ridiculous complaints.

Source: former local union officer and national union staff organizer. 




 And the worst part is, if everybody would just read the damn contract *before* they personally have a complaint (which may/may not be a legitimate grievance), everything would be so much better. I tell people, "You'd better believe that management studies every word and comma and line break in that *legally binding contract* -- why would you want to disarm yourself by not reading it?" 




 [Progressive Democrats of America](http://www.pdamerica.org/about-us/history) is essentially the faction within the Democratic Party that doesn't want Clinton to be the nominee. They are not the problem. 

Many PACs serve a legitimate purpose and do good work. Super PACs, which don't have to disclose who their donations come from, are the biggest part of the problem. The "Ready for Bernie"/"Bet on Bernie" PAC is another sort of problem: they disclose, but although they claim to be supporting Sanders, there's no way to tell whether the uses they put donations to are helpful to his campaign.

I say "they" when referring to this PAC (which is a hybrid form, but not a Super PAC), but right now [there's no reason to think it's more than one person, with unclear motive.](http://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/37xffz/this_website_claims_to_be_a_bernie_sanders_super/crql9z6)
 




 Not all PACs are bad. The problem is Super PACs, which don't have to report donors. 

[Progressive Democrats of America](http://www.pdamerica.org/about-us/history) worked to get Sanders to run as a Dem, and are now working to get him the nomination. They are not the problem. 




 Um, maybe someone should be thinking about what it takes to become a delegate to the Democratic Convention... 




  I think this might be a PAC set up by Hillary or the Republican's backers (billionaires) to slander Bernie 

No, it's just a ["political entrepreneur"](http://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/37xffz/this_website_claims_to_be_a_bernie_sanders_super/crqlleo) who serially uses whatever issue he can raise money around to bolster his resume and, not so incidentally, pay himself as Treasurer.

It will be exactly as much of a problem as Sanders' supporters let it become. The way to avert that is to educate ourselves and teach others how this system works and why they should only contribute to the official campaign. 




 That's what everybody who supports Bernie should do: not only give to the campaign directly yourself, but make sure that others do not give to these unaccountable PACs. It's unlikely that the Sanders campaign will make any statement like this, so it's up to the grassroots. 

And that's a good thing: talking about what's wrong with campaign finance is a key part of his agenda. 




 It wasn't just lamps: the ceramic statues were on every other coffee table. The original was designed by [Royal Hickman for Haeger Pottery](http://www.haegerpotteries.com/haeger.php?section_id=3#1941) and was first produced in 1941 in three different sizes. 
























 I agree. That's why it's so important to teach supporters about how campaign finance works. I do not believe the Sanders campaign will have much if anything to say about this; it's up to grassroots supporters to do this. And it's not a distraction -- objection to conventional, currently legal financing is an key part of his platform. 




 go away, idiot spammer.

reported. 









 This is the correct answer. 




 The press is not going to call this thing a Super PAC, because it isn't one. Fox might do that, but no serious news org will.

BTW, [**here's a good primer on every aspect of campaign finance**](http://www.amazon.com/Unstacking-Deck-Reporters-Campaign-Finance/dp/0976603756) *except* 527s and Super Pacs, which arose right after this was published.

 




 Thre's nothing to report: it's a real, legitimate *but uncontrollable and unhelpful* PAC. See my other comments here for more info. 




 This is the critical point. The linked PAC is just the first to come to this sub's attention. There will be many more. The task is to educate supporters to only give to the campaign. 




 They haven't donated, they've pledged. [He has only recently started taking actual contributions.](http://news.yahoo.com/cary-lee-peterson-love-media-085228219.html) The list you see is autogenerated when potential donors typed in their own info, which is why it looks so ragged.

 There is, but it's not what you think. 

The PAC is real, and apparently registered with the Federal Elections Commission. That doesn't mean its existence has the approval of the Sanders campaign. 

This PAC, which is in no way connected to the Sanders campaign, is the project of a middle aged lobbyist named [Carey L. Peterson](https://sites.google.com/site/caryleepetersonprofilearticle/). 

From a quick survey of this lobbyists' history and other projects, he appears to be a political entrepreneur -- he's in it for the money. I don't see anything that suggests he's a true believer, and sending money to this PAC is not a good idea.

EDIT: [**Here's an article from Bernie's hometown paper that explains this PAC.**](http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2015/05/30/sanders-unable-superpacs/28184005/)

 




 It's not a trend. It's just the simplest way to keep track of a pencil when you're working mainly with that (rather than a keyboard) and also need your hands free for other tasks. In publishing, especially newspapers, editors used to use special blue pencils for copyediting, and keeping track of those was especially important, which is why the stereotype of an old school newspaper editor shows him (of course) with a pencil behind his ear.  




 I hope he's making better use of his time than that! 




 Maybe you've got to vote for who you've got to vote for to keep the worse of evils from gaining power.

Fortunately, between now and the next presidential election there's  time to do a lot of education on root causes and strategies for bringing justice. Thanks, Bernie! 




 Amen! I haven't been able to get back there for several years, but I love camping there and dream about it often.

Only, next time I'll get out *before* the rain turns the road into caliche and my rental car winds up in the ditch...

 Something got lost in translation here ... 




 There are some extremist "feminists" who act more like female supremacists

Yes, and how that happened deserves a lot more attention.

OP, while you're doing background research, be sure to look into the movement that *preceded* second-wave feminism: Women's Liberation. Based in an internationalist, class-based analysis, this is a perspective that simply could not ever be warped into the grotesque caricature that academics made of feminism. And the women who considered themselves part of a global women's liberation movement were the ones who shook the world in the late 60s/early 70s. 




 Home is a good place to be. Give that li'l fuzzball an extra few pets from his online fans!  




 Please tell us the messy face is from medication for his eyes ...? 




 Yes, because it's not backed up by any hard data. You're asking about a social dynamic; they're whining about their individual experiences. 




 Because most people are too smart to think men *as a group* are routinely victimized simply because they are men. 
  




 Whose media do you mean? Men claim victim status here on reddit  every day. You can rebalance your views by reading about how ridiculous such whining is [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/againstmensrights/).

EDIT: Sorry for the duplicates -- my internet is stuttering b/c rainstorm. 




 Because they have no choice: there are [at least seven different laws in the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_of_origin#United_States) requiring that all imports carry a Country of Origin (COO) label.

The "Made in China" labels in clothing are especially galling to those of us old enough to remember when many garments carried [this label](https://laborrightsarecivilrights.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_20130405_155016_375-1.jpg) instead. That was something to wear with pride. 




 It's not illegal for women to be topless everywhere in the US. The right has been litigated in several places (e.g., Columbus OH) and the legal basis for the right is clear. Places where a law against it are still on the books are those where nobody has yet filed a lawsuit.

Adding, the organization that *seems* to lead on this issue, GoTopless, is actually a front for a cult -- the Raelians -- who believe humans are ruled by aliens, among other forms of nuttery. 




 But now you're the expert among the friends you have that don't already backpack. You can be the trip leader! 

And don't totally give up on meeting new people this way. Just make sure you spend more than a few minutes talking to them before heading out. 

Remember, the "bad co-hiker" experiences will someday be hilarious tales to be told around a campfire. Like the time I led a hike in Grand Canyon with a guy who brought along a 36 lb. pack loaded with two hardback novels, a fifth of bourbon (which of course broke and soaked all his clothing) and a crackpot notion that leaving his cigarettes at the rim was the best way to quit smoking. By the end of day one his longtime GF hated him so much she left early and hiked out alone with a torn ACL; the rest of us wanted to throw him to the condors but settled for making fun of him at every turn. 




 You never know what tomorrow will bring to your parking lot. Maybe a traveling circus will use it to stage their parade to the tenting ground. Maybe someone will decide to have extremely inappropriate personal relations with a parking meter. Maybe Oprah will stop by, and get locked out of her car, unable to escape her entourage and fans. You never know ... keep your eyes open, your camera handy, and bring the winners back to /r/WTF!

 I do have a very good idea why I'm talking about, and I never denied the ongoing damage. But your claim the "the Indians forgot" is asinine. Try making that assertion in that in any Native community (even one of the reddit subs) and see how it is received.  




 Remember to ask in the local reddit community where you're moving. 




 it completely turned me off to backpacking with others.

Oh, come on. You went backpacking with *strangers*, not friends. With friends it's a kind of fun your non-backpacking friends can never even dream of. Especially when you plan a big trip that takes months to jointly plan and prepare, which can be the best part of any trip. 




 That's pretty insulting. Nobody forgot. This is about wealth and political power imbalances, as usual. 




 The shelters are separate from the HQ of the organizations that run them. The hotline is widely advertised, but not the physical address of the actual shelter. 




 Amen. Another option is to find a *foster* home by Sunday night, then keep working to find the right permanent home.

OP, why did this *suddenly* become an issue with a five y.o. dog? 




 Nah, for small amounts the people to talk to are at (614) 466-2660.

 




 You're not helping yourself here. 




 Of course I know it was local. But you were responding to a guy from California.

There is one buffet chain I've loved in other cities over many years that I wish would come here: [Souper Salad.](http://www.soupersalad.com/) Among other goodies, they have an outstanding gingerbread always on offer. 




  They think they're privy to secret/privileged information. 

That's a major dynamic in *all* conspiracy theories. Overwhelmingly scary things seem to require overwhelmingly big singular explanations -- compound dynamics and "we don't know yet" don't cut it. So it must be that the Big Truth is out there, it's just being kept from ordinary people like the speaker because they're not part of the powerful elite -- except that now their "knowledge" of the Big Truth gives them special standing above the sheep.  




 Aww, c'mon: Potlucks are a great way to socialize, and most often safer than your average commercial buffet. That one made national news because it was so unusual. Anyway, this one comes with [music](http://www.potluckshows.org/AquacatToTheRescue.mp3).

Good luck getting that chorus out of your head.  




 I'm guessing you're kidding, but the issue here is the union contract. They've been able in the past (don't know if this one is still true) to do things like define "unfounded" in a way that automatically ruled out any complaint against an officer that came in more than 30 days after the incident, regardless of how serious or well-documented.  




 On of the reasons I ask questions about the details behind high quality photos that show up in the sea of cell phone snaps that floods the "new" page is to find out whether the image is original without having to bother with a reverse image search, so thank you for that info. Faking it is especially bad form in this sub, which values OC.

Now I'm taking back my upvote. 




 Weird: I have hardly ever seen photos taken from the bottom of the incline. Most pics are taken [looking downhill.](http://www.ridetheincline.com/images/uploads/general/incline-inside.jpg)

Adding, the incline is a private enterprise outside the National Park, but whatever. 




 Try chaining your bike to a tree in NYC and you'll have it confiscated and face a $1000 fine. Chain it to any other public infrastructure and it can be removed as "abandoned property", although enforcement varies. That's just one city, off the top of my head. You're welcome to test this out, or do your own research. 




 If this were real, you wouldn't be the one posting it. It would have been every post to the front page, linked from serious news orgs, two days ago.

I replicated your Google search and there isn't a single credible source there. Are you new to the internet? 




 The lock ceases to be "yours" when you leave it on a public bridge. It's not theft to repair vandalism.

EDIT: Bikes are different IF they are locked to a rack. 




  here it is called divetelact

In the US it's called [kitten milk replacer](http://www.petsmart.com/cat/milk-replacers/cat-36-catid-200031?OVMTC=Exact site= creative=50564886892 OVKEY=kitten+milk+replacer url_id=148263772 device=c devicemodel= gclid=CN-SzMeq6cUCFZSGaQodYCkAuw). 




  wouldn't an abuser be able to locate the shelter just as easily as an abused person

No. Shelters go to great lengths to keep their locations secret.

 How is it possible to steal what is essentially litter?

  I believe they call it autistic now

autism != retardation. In any case, neither of those terms is appropriate, and both are offensive when used out of medical context. 

What you both mean is *willfully obtuse*. 




 This is an officer known to  many people: Sgt. Steve Livingston has been the community liaison officer for the whole northern part of the city, and is a specialist in community policing. He's also been in the news because he was hit by a car in 2012, breaking 17 bones. The FOP made a huge stink about the outcome of the case against the driver, IIRC.

I'd love to be snarky about this, since I think the FOP is a big part of the problem with policing here, but I just can't manage it. 




 [Here's a guide to caring for small kittens.](http://www.kittenrescue.org/index.php/cat-care/kitten-care-handbook/) There should be a recipe here for making kitten milk replacer at home until you can get to a pet food store to buy some.

Another thing you should do is look around to see if there are more kittens out there. If the momcat is around, she'll take care of them, but it not you'll have to intercede.

This is a great adventure you've embarked upon. Watch out for falling in love with that little squirt!

 This piece is from a libertarian group (published in *Forbes*...), so there's some weirdness near the end about "mandatory donation disclosures stifling participation in the democratic process", but it's a welcome reminder of an incredibly important and hard-fought legal victory. 

Adding, I had the privilege of meeting Corliss near the end of his life, and he was a great man. He never stopped supporting peace, justice and socialism. 









 ...  a reporter is considering doing a brief news story that might negatively portray one of the sponsor companies and the company prefers they minimize coverage...

I don't know how much of a problem media corruption is...

The kind of corruption you cite is infinitely less common than you imagine. The vast majority of reporters and editors in serious news organizations are honest. The problems you see are primarily due to the model of journalism being practiced: a blind belief in "objectivity through balance" combined with a skewed agenda favoring what readers want to consume rather than what they need to know, all dialed up to 11 by the concentration of ownership that happened over the past twenty years. Investigative teams all over the country were disbanded and defunded as marketing experts convinced the new beancounters to chase reader/viewer eyeballs with increasingly salacious clickbait.

This isn't something that's going to be fixed anytime soon -- especially not by non-journalists after the main players have spent two decades trying to figure it out.  So focusing on this instead of on-the-ground organizing would be a serious mistake. 

 




 [Harvey Houses](http://www.legendsofamerica.com/66-harveyhouse.html) are a fabulous legacy in the west. I happened upon La Posada while it was being brought back from the dead -- it's now a showcase, well worth a side trip.

 Yes, although that's a subset of being politically inexperienced in general -- the minor downside of having inspired lots of new activists.



 




 There are new people in the room every day. Don't deny them the chance to discover this because you're already hip to it. 




 Keep trying! A delayed response is not the same as no response. Sometimes it takes sending those "come out and play with me" (even online) messages many times before a person can really hear them, and then the sheer number of times you've tried becomes a factor in itself: your friend can't ignore how many times you've reached out, and some part of his brain will have to recognize that you do care, and that this is because *he's someone worth caring about*. 




 The first thing that goes when you become depressed is your judgment. And the thing that keeps you from turning that around is the notion *which everybody has* that all your thoughts and feelings are real because they're yours. But they're not, and being willing to trust one other person who is telling you that a certain belief is "just  the illness talking" can be a lifesaver. 




 May it be so. 

I wish, however, that it was a better union than the Guild. I'm old enough to remember when GCIU represented Newsday, and negotiated 40K buyouts in advance of a layoff. That couldn't happen today, but damn, they fought hard for the reporters.  




 You're right, but the website is still awful. 














 That looks a lot like a very old dessicated tree stump. What makes you think it's a living plant? 




 Yeah, that website is awful. The video must be available at a better site somewhere.

 Nope. Those are site-wide ads, over which subreddits have no control. 




 As a journalist, I completely agree with your second part. But journalistic integrity has never had much of a toehold in TV news, and CNN seems especially resistant to shaming.

I don't think there's much point moaning about this. The Sanders campaign is *intentionally* focusing on social media and face-to-face organizing, and that's exactly right.  




 (1) Paragraphs! Use them.

 Fexofenadine is the generic for Allegra, a former prescription drug now OTC. It's easily tolerated and highly effective, but you have to take it continuously, not on an as-needed basis. It's pretty cheap, so it's worth a try for a month. I don't know how to characterize our allergies vs. someone else's; I just know neither of us would be able to have cats without intervention. 




 You mean N. Broadway and High, or Graceland? I can't stand the North Broadway one because of the floor layout, but Graceland (which is a Kroger Marketplace) is one of the better stores.  




 My husband and I are both allergic, but both love cats -- so we take fexofenadine every day, and stopped noticing the cat dander years ago.

 I thought this was an interesting intellectual debate -- until I learned more about the "poet" in question. As a *real* poet informed me after I stupidly Tweeted this story without researching further,

Place is a white conceptual artist and lawyer who has published the documents (all of them) from a criminal case and called it poetry. She wrote in Joel Chandler Harris dialect, and her appropriation of this has been the subject of extensive debate. She says, "Authorship doesn't matter. Content doesn't master. Form doesn't master. Meter doesn't matter. All that matters is the trace of poetry."

So the answer is, no, tweeting GWTW doesn't make this poet racist. That ship sailed long ago: she was a consolidated, intentionally provocative racist long before this project.

EDIT: ...and damn the Daily Beast for omitting that critical context.

 




 The Washington Examiner brought the Mother Jones story to their attention. 




 Not everybody who pushes chemtrails is un- or mis-educated.

I don't know what the answer is to people like him.

 




 Nope. They didn't *steal* it, they just did what ProPublica hopes other news orgs will do, which is reprint their work (by prearrangement). 

I just have a fixation about this because PP is the result of the abandonment of investigative journalism teams at major newspapers in favor of outsourcing to free-standing groups dependent on foundations for funding. It's a terrible model, and the transition cost a lot of very good reporters their livelihoods. So I want PP to succeed with its mixed-funding model, and right now it still needs to demonstrate support by showing public support via clickthroughs and shares.

You did more good than harm by posting any version at all of this very important story. I was speaking mostly to other readers, not you, and I thank you for taking this seeming criticism so well.

 Buzzfeed also recently was granted a seat in the White House briefing room, which caused old media heads to explode. They're hiring some good reporters. 




 She has said she won't, and her integrity is what her fans value. Plus, she has a completely other strategy in mind. 




 If that's true, the mods need to reconsider. Buzzfeed is gearing up and becoming a serious news org. It recently got a seat in the WH briefing room, ahead of reporters from better-known news orgs, and that happened because of their new commitment to serious political reporting.

 You might try one of the photography subreddits if nothing pops here. But eventually, somebody almost always shows up here with the right answer. 




 It's everywhere on reddit right now. It would take a lot of swatting, even with the best possible answer, to deal with all of it. I suggest ignoring the venues that will always be hostile to Sanders, and focus on dealing with it in general discussion forums.

And, frankly, this WILL make it to the venue that still determines how a lot of people vote: your local daily newspaper. You may not usually read it, but during the next 18 months, it's a must-read and an important place to speak up, through letters to the editor. 




 Can you read any numbers on it anywhere?

Pay special attention to the last bit about going out late at night. May your kitty be home in your lap soon! 




 Be careful: a social media call to fool around with your employer's  FB rating by embellishing the story could backfire. You've given more than enough info here for someone -- the jerks or your boss or IHOP corporate -- to identify your real name, and you can't assume none of those people reads reddit. You also can't assume that IHOP would condone that behavior, which (since you're one of their managers) could look like IHOP is doing it, possibly in violation of FB's TOS.

Much better to get in front of this by telling the story from your point of view, in writing, to your immediate supervisor or district manager. If you can get a copy of the police incident report,great -- if this takes time, tell them you've asked for it already. That alone will help protect you from blowback you don't deserve.

  more and more jobs are being taken up because of increases in automation

The problem isn't advertising or automation. The problem is concentration of ownership into the hands of a few megacorps that have zero commitment to journalistic values and demand an unrealistically high ROI -- thus, the decimation of editorial staffers, starting with the ones whose work took a long time and cost a lot of money.

ProPublica is great -- but you do understand, I hope, that its existence came about because there were so many old-school journos without jobs. It was almost the only success out of hundreds of efforts to build something new. What happened is basically that the megacorps outsourced serious reporting to foundations, leaving reporters without *ongoing* and (relatively) secure institutional support. The new organizations employ a tiny fraction of the available talent and publish an equally tiny fraction of the serious news that used to get published. 

You can't see the difference because you can't see the work that is no longer even getting started anymore, but I've been in the business for longer than most redditors have been alive and the scale of what's no longer investigated -- especially at the local/state level -- is horrifying.

Anyway, the idiot mods here have decided that this post is off-topic because it isn't "explicitly about current US politics", so if you want to comment further, you'll need to go to one of the other postings. 




 I didn't say "what they think is the right thing". I said, and meant, the [objectively] right thing -- the action that is sustainable within the ecology of human society.

The point is that most people, psychopaths and sociopaths excepted, are both hard-wired and conditioned to want to be fair and compassionate. When some fail to do this, it's a lack of resources -- material or knowledge -- that causes the problem. The idea that it's only natural to compete is so reductionist as to be completely misleading. When public policy is based on that assumption we get massive wealth inequality and wars to protect the system that made some people so much richer than others. 














  Scratching it actually makes it worse

But applying very hot water for as long as you can stand it *does* help, especially if you do it immediately after being bitten.  




 Most people, most of the time, want to do the right thing. 




 I know the VT ACLU has been keeping watch on police misconduct in Burlington, if you're still there.

Remember, different cities have different histories. What we're all really looking for is an overview of best practices, and of best strategies for getting there. My city had a long history of lefty lawyers suing the City for $$$$ over individual incidents, plus a lot of agitation from white radicals who are anti-cop, without much changing. Then 20 years ago it got so bad the Justice Department almost took over the police department, before reaching an agreement with the City that had the effect of forcing a big jump ahead on things like training. We're still struggling, but at a different starting level than other cities, even those in the same state.

But I have another question: why is this discussion in this reddit? I love Bernie, but I'm unaware of his laser-focused economic populism campaign taking on an agenda for building an all-sided progressive movement. He almost certainly agrees on the importance of this issue, but the task at hand is a campaign for office.  




 There are several national organizations that have been working for police accountability for decades, and almost certainly a group in the city where you live. Have you reached out to anybody other than reddit about this? I don't mean to discourage you -- this is an incredibly important issue to commit energy to -- but for the last year it seems like everybody wants to start from scratch, for no good reason. 

 




 What letter? 




 When I clicked through to this, my elderly cat sitting next to me snapped to attention and watched the gif several times through. She's never been interested in anything else on that screen or the TV, but apparently the way a bird moves is hard-wired in her brain.

So the guys who gave that bird water *also* gave a far-distant critter something, too. 




 The people who did this study were a studies-for-hire company. Maybe they just aren't very competent.

Or maybe they were created specifically to come up with results like this, so they can push a specific agenda: [Barna Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Barna_Group#Overview) is an *evangelical* Christian polling company designed to provide "research and marketing expertise as a service to Christian ministry." 



















 "Wire copy" used to mean something: AP, UPI, Reuters. This article is especially useful because it points to a particular fake news "wire service" as the root of the viral explosion. Other news coverage after the fact merely noted that the Mirror had retracted the story. 









 That's where 99% of the problem is, and that's why this bill is just grandstanding. 




 A reporter at the *Providence Journal* concisely summed up the cost of the takeover of most US daily newspapers by corporations during the last two decades in a comment in [this article about the recent sale of the last family-owned major daily to an investment group](http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2015/06/11/dispatch-sale-heres-how-gatehouse-has-handled.html);

... many reporters let go were veterans with deep institutional and community knowledge. They were replaced by younger, less-expensive writers, something that "gnaws at a lot of us in the newsroom ...

"Gnaws at us" likely means they can't stop thinking about the coverage they can't do any longer for lack of staff and funding: enterprise and investigative and science reporting, for starters. 





























 I can't believe I missed this. Must go adjust brain. 




 Don't ask. Seriously. Just be glad the annual temporary derangement caused by the end of high school classes hasn't spilled over into this reddit. 




 Since when are German Shepherds called cats? 




 OP, please post this to /r/Ohio for extra fun! 




  I've never even seen that meme.

This may be the first time anybody has ever admitted this on reddit. I'm sure it's true for others as well, but yours is a brave statement. 




 what was Hoot ?

Hoot was a [humor magazine](http://www.columbuslibrary.org/cmlcnix/searchresults.cfm?sort= afterdate= beforedate= searchlist=OSLIN%2C%20IRV%20%28%60HOOT%27%20MAGAZINE%29 searchindex=S pub=ALL) founded by local writer [Irv Oslin](https://irvoslin.wordpress.com/), who also wrote a weekly column full of epic snark for Columbus Guardian. After a hilarious but tragically failed run for Mayor of Columbus and the collapse of CG, he moved to Ashland and became a serious reporter.

  




 Good points. A few more are detailed in this post about [**how to find a lost cat**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/199wf8/missing_kitty_in_the_arlington_center_w_henderson/c8m7lkp) from the Reddit Guide to Columbus in the sidebar.

OP, if you do find him, please come back and let us know! 




 I'm (always) speaking in terms of the basic infrastructure of reddit, without RES or gold. Also I subscribe to a hellacious number of reddits, so I see as much of the marginal stuff as I can find time to look at, without even trying. 




 Reading comprehension problems here beyond fixing. 




 A meeting with wine. (This is actually a long-running in-joke among fellow travelers.) 




 I'm not objecting to the amount of punishment, but the *kind*: do you want to live in a society where judges can tell reporters to write articles to the judge's specification? 

Journalists are watching this to see what the news org will do, and what the editor will do. Both *should* refuse this sentence, but the editor in question is a widely-despised hack and will probably cave. 

I have no idea what an appropriate conventional sentence would be. The guy violated a very clear court order, in an egregious manner. And this wasn't for any reason of high principle, just the reflexive race to get a scoop. What do you think?  




 Funny -- I go looking to check the zeitgeist on a regular basis, too, but usually by way of an intentional tour of my "friends" pages (submissions and comments) plus a big dose of serendipity via the random button. Together, it's like reading the best-edited magazine imaginable. 




 Doesn't this guy have any handlers? 









 Some people find it reassuring to know that what was once a slapped-together block party with radical politics has managed to survive for 43 years...

   /r/all is a bigger shitpile then normal,

Why does anybody who understands how the site works even look at that page? I've always found that users who cite that can safely be assumed to be new and/or very young. Not surprisingly, it's Pao-hate central today. 




 This is so true. With very few exceptions, these are literally kids on summer break. [I had them pegged at 15](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/39fhtr/eli5_why_is_reddit_dying/cs2wnr3) rather than 17, but same principle applies: [school's out, and this is something to do](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/39gj8x/eli5_why_are_people_getting_crazy_over_removed/cs35216).

The illusion that it's a bigger, more diverse, more serious crowd can be easily dispelled by a few minutes of reading the user histories of the redditors screaming the loudest. They talk about "reddit's front page" and mean /r/all ... 




 That's one of the best self-criticisms I've ever seen. 

And as someone who used to carry around a tiny version of [this](https://img0.etsystatic.com/060/1/8030109/il_340x270.744115886_i75i.jpg), I have a significant basis of comparison w/r/t self-criticism ... 









 Okay, forget Jason Taylor -- at least for now. He did get hired by Gatehouse (New Media Investment Group), but for the foreseeable future he's mainly the [new publisher and president for the Las Vegas Review Journal.](http://www.thestreet.com/story/13184209/1/jason-taylor-named-president-and-publisher-of-las-vegas-review-journal-president-of-gatehouse-media-western-us-publishing-operations.html) Who knows whether Gatehouse thinks Columbus is part of their western region... 




 Thanks for this post, which is about 100% more informative than anything the Dispatch itself has published, and way more important than most of the posts here lately about any subject. Love or hate the Dispatch, it still has huge influence on the overall public understanding of what constitutes news in Columbus.

The graf below, describing what happened at the ProJo, succinctly describes the central issue with concentration of newspaper ownership into the hands of a few corporations that care more about the bottom line than the public good:

...many reporters let go were veterans with deep institutional and community knowledge. They were replaced by younger, less-expensive writers, something that "gnaws at a lot of us in the newsroom...

"Gnaws at us" likely means they can't stop thinking about the coverage they can't do any longer for lack of staff and funding: enterprise and investigative and science reporting, for starters.

The guy they say will take over, Jason Taylor from Gannett, has most recently been running the Chattanooga Times Free Press and the Jackson (MS) Clarion-Ledger. Neither paper has suffered big staff cuts AFAIK, but I'm reserving judgment until I hear back from friends who work at those papers. 




 Lots of practice makes perfect! 




 My thoughts, exactly. This is *not* uplifting news.

Anybody who thinks you're too negative or over-reacting needs to know that this year, 2015, has been called the "crunch year" by climate scientists -- the last chance to even slow down the destruction of our home planet. In light of that, a "business decision" to slowly taper off production and use up the bad ingredient can be seen for what it is: the immoral acceptance of the amoral dictates of capitalism.  




 You say that like it's a bad thing. It's not! 




 Hey, at least he finally logged off for a while. I was starting to think that if he didn't get some sleep soon, we'd wind up reading about how his neighbors always thought he was a little off, but nobody imagined he would...  




 Loafs gonna loaf. 




 What does this even mean? 

The way corporate owners control coverage is by *not* covering things that should be reported -- and there's no way for most reporters to effectively counter that. So they cover what they can, as ethically as they can, and so manage to at least feed their kids. The news industry has changed so much in the last 20 years that you could staff a hundred good news orgs with the reporters who have been fired for objecting to the new regime.

Be glad that there are still people trying to do it right.
 




 Not exactly: it referred to [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jlbdf/2_am_ice_chili_shower/c2d2hcz).

 Okay. I wondered if you were trying to play a cruel trick on readers who decided to wake 'n' bake before redditing. Glad to be wrong! 




 This is a serious answer: the people who are upset about this are very young and very wrong about what constitutes freedom of speech. School's out for the summer, and this is something to do.

You'd never know that it's possible to spend the whole day yesterday on reddit, having great conversations and reading interesting posts, without even hearing  about this "rebellion". Only people who think /r/all is the central forum on reddit are reporting on this as though it were anything other than the latest tantrum by middle-schoolers.

 I'm unsure why this post has attracted no attention here -- it's an amazing story. Could it have been removed by mods because of my previous comment about the editor in question, Larry Henry? Well, just in case, here's [one tiny piece of his backstory](http://jimromenesko.com/2014/03/26/letter-arkansas-tv-newsman/) that only hints at why everybody who has ever worked for him thinks he's a hack (at best).

  I am way off the mark

This. Reddit is not "a free speech initiative". It's a business. It's nowhere near dying. A lot of 15 year olds are bent out of shape because ... they're 15 years old. 

It's entirely possible to spend an entire day (or night) on reddit right now without even knowing about this "scandal". I know about it because I subscribe to /r/announcements, but the other 50 or so subreddits I visit haven't even noticed the "uproar".

If you're bothering to read /r/all, stop. It's a piss-poor substitute for the combination of good subscriptions plus use of the "random" button. And SRD is a cesspool to be avoided at all costs.

 Oh, dear. My hotel tip is, if you don't already have a reservation by now, there may be a problem. This is peak season at one of the most heavily-visited vacation destinations in the world. It can take hours just to get past the South Rim front gate. So grab the first reservation you can get (forget about deals) and start out extremely early to drive there from Phoenix or wherever. Also, read the official park website from top to bottom -- you won't be sorry!  




 Are you planning to do any serious hiking (i.e., below the rim) or just visiting? Reading through responses to other posts here will give you a lot of answers, but for specific tips it would help to know what you plan to do there. 




 I meant the sentencing. 









 So whose ethics are more tortured by this judge: law, or journalism? 









 This mind-bending story gets even stranger when you know that the editor in question is one of the most widely despised hacks in the region.

 DO NOT give the kitten regular cow's milk -- it will cause diarrhea, which can be fatal in a kitten.

DO figure out how old the kitten is by checking this [age progression chart](http://www.alleycat.org/kittenprogression). If the kitten is very young, it will need feeding with special food every few hours, and may well need more care than you can handle.( Be honest with yourself about this, because leaving it alone for too long could kill it.) If you can handle it, read everything [on this page and the pages it links to.](http://www.alleycat.org/page.aspx?pid=289)

DO take kitty to a vet as soon as possible to check for diseases.

DO ask more questions as they come up!

But OP, be careful here: you can look into the GoFundMe campaign, but don't start doxxing other redditors or this post will be removed and you will be banned.  




 This is why paying some minimal amount of attention to actual news reporting is a good idea.

I have a couple that couldn't find homes for this reason, and now they're stunning. One kitten I did manage to give away despite being the strangest looking baby suddenly bloomed at about 12 weeks into a cover girl.

Anyway, your kitten is fine just as she is. What is her name? 









 It's owned by a realty company -- [here's the registration info](http://flightaware.com/resources/registration/N35HM). No idea what that thing on top is.

EDIT: no longer owned by a realty company -- they sold it to an anesthesiologist last week (see last line on linked page). So maybe the takeoffs and landings were just a new owner playing with a new toy.

  Hedges and others are smart enough to recognize that if there isn't a peaceful revolution there will be violent chaos.

But not apparently smart enough to take the lesson that a "revolutionary moment" is when the people's resistance has the capacity to manage the earthquake of global economic disaster, not just when old systems and structures are failing. That term has a specific meaning, and this isn't it. 

To only point  to the objective conditions without assessing the subjective factor -- organized strategic resistance -- is to raise false hopes of a shortcut that doesn't require the tedium of base-building. If those false hopes lead self-declared revolutionaries to assume there's a mass movement at their backs when there isn't one, the result will be worse than ugly.    




   If you're really poor you probably get a lot of subsidies 

I'll muster more charity than I feel to say that I hope you never have to find out *first hand* how absurd your assumption here really is. 




 Think about what it will sound like to try to call the kitty by its name if it wanders away. Neither of those names roll easily off the tongue. (My brother insists there's an International Cat Naming Convention which requires all cat names to end in an "ee" sound for this reason. But what does he know? He only has 11 cats.)

How about Inky? 




 Yeah ... no. There's a reason why the leaders of the New Left summed up the main error of 60s and 70s as having believed *that* was "a revolutionary moment". Until there is a unified movement capable of both strategic planning and logistical resilience, the only thing going on here is temptation to take shortcuts.

There is a real danger in this moment from the agitators on the left and the right who wrongly think that it's enough to "bring chaos", after which everything will sort itself out. Such a scenario would default to the right, but probably not the way some of them assume. Preventing that is probably the most urgent task; leading a revolution is rather more than the left can do, especially in the US.


 




 This is an Attention Getting Mechanism, as my mother used to say. You cat wants you to come to her, and play with her, more often. 




 Handwriting -- specifically, signatures -- plus the lag in equipment upgrades due to budget restrictions in government offices probably accounts for a lot of it.  




 Yes, she did, and it was awesome. I am not a Hillary fan, but this is an excellent development. I hope it can be seen, even by Sanders supporters, for the great step it is.

 Thank you! I haven't watched the whole thing yet, but right away you can see the type of seats my friend and I got -- right at field level, behind a low railing -- and even see another girl get the same treatment my friend got. I can't wait to see if we're in this film!

Adding, I can already see it includes ["the fifth Beatle", radio DJ Murray the K](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_the_K#.22The_Fifth_Beatle.22), whose "Swingin' Soiree" show on WINS in New York was the soundtrack we listened to every night on [first-generation transistor radios](http://www.mcrfb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/1963-Teen-Girl-Listening-to-Transistor-Radio.jpg) when our parents thought we were studying or sleeping. Murray the K was referred to by some parents (not mine) as "Moral Decay", and blamed for fanning the flames of Beatlemania. The idea that the Beatles' music was just that good was lost on a lot of older folks then. 

Fortunately, my parents knew enough about music to appreciate both the roots and the innovation that made the band sound so new. My mother even bought herself a four-inch diameter button to wear that said "I love Ringo!", and although they didn't attend, they bought me and my brother tickets and drove us to Shea. It was an unforgettable gift. 

 




 [Angola prison is so infamous](http://www.southernstudies.org/2014/03/institute-index-a-brief-history-of-the-hell-that-i.html) that most American readers -- especially in /r/law -- think of it before they think of the nation. 




 *Nobody* could hear anything, including the Beatles themselves (they didn't have the same kind of sound system as today). I think there are documentaries that show how loud and crazy the scene was. 




 Blame? For what? 




 It seemed like mere minutes. We couldn't believe it when they ran off the field. [Looking it up now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles%27_1965_US_tour#The_Shea_Stadium_show), I see that the Beatles' set was 30 minutes long. I also see that there were five other acts, which I assume we heard but ignored.

BTW, the classmate I went with climbed over the railing in front of us to try to storm the stage (we had GREAT seats), but was grabbed and pushed back onto her seat by stadium security. I don't think she even paused in her screaming.

 I was there that day at Shea Stadium, and can tell you that (a) I spent the whole time screaming my head off, and (b) I never expected to do that until it happened. I was there *for the music* -- I'd had an excellent musical education and knew just how talented these musicians really were -- but once there I got caught up in the mass hysteria. As soon as it was over I was stunned and annoyed to realize that we hadn't been able to hear a single note.

 









 I'm saving this image to use for reaction comments.

 You forgot the /s . 




 *Columbus Guardian* was a better paper, for the short time it existed. It had serious reporters, serious attitude and Irv Oslin, FFS. 

Even *Alive!* was a better paper than *TOP* until *Alive!* stopped covering local news in 1988. Hell, even *Hoot!* was a better paper than TOP, whose business model boiled down to pissing people off to guarantee newsstand pick-up greater than the skin ads alone brought in.

And the FreePress has been squatting space that should be taken by something better grounded ever since it went cuckoo for chemtrails. The Black Box voting obsession didn't help their credibility -- or that of saner organizations that affiliate with them for lack of any other general purpose progressive outlet.

Anyway, I don't see *The Dispatch* coverage changing much. The news hole is so small already that it *can't* change much, and they don't need to feed readers' inevitable resentment against the interlopers even one minute sooner than absolutely necessary. I'm guessing the new owners will tweak the peripheral businesses before they change the flagship publication, drawing out the advantage of reflexive reader loyalty to the familiar format while they study the market up close.
 




 Ah, I misread your description of reality for a declaration of principle. Sorry!

 




 Um, no. I had the unnerving experience in the mid-90s of interviewing a national figure in the WS/"patriot" movement *at his home*. He had mirrors mounted on the ceiling to see around corners, several attack-trained Dobermans, a bio-war laboratory in his kitchen -- and a single bookshelf with about 10 editions of the Geneva Bible and nothing else. It was the only printed material in sight. That kinda put me off the book.

This isn't the first time this clothing company has gotten headlines for "accidentally" replicating an offensive symbol: last time, it was a swastika. Apparently, this guy thinks such coverage is what they call "earned media". 
 









 Civility is *everything* in an anonymous online forum. This is where we get to make up our own rules, which are based on what we want to get out of the experience. 

Reddit allows for thousands of places where users can be brutal to each other if they want. But this is the subreddit that represents Columbus to the world, and it *can* be the kind of ideal neighborhood almost nobody ever gets to live in IRL: respectful of others' choices, supportive of others' needs, irreverent enough to laugh at ourselves, passionate about the future of our common homeplace.

Civility until unjustly attacked is a pretty good standard.

  




  That's not a personal attack. She's a pretty shitty poster. Everything she posts is either uninteresting, self-promotional or has been posted a dozen times before.

Are you listening to yourself? Of course that's a personal attack. If one user's posts are so annoying that you're willing to go round up 18 citations to her posts -- four of those from other subreddits, and three of *those* from another state -- it's well beyond a discussion of why people in this subreddit, in general, seem to downvote everything, from anybody.

If you want to critique a certain style of using reddit, fine. I'd probably agree with you about this style -- not because there are a lot of similar pleas for help that could/should be found independently through simple searches, but because there aren't any posts contributing important local information or art or opportunities. It's a very selfish way to approach a public forum, let alone a community. I thinks it is a style deserves criticism, because if it becomes the norm it undercuts the usefulness, never mind the enjoyability, of the forum.

*[donewaiting.com, I'm looking at you.]*

Anyway: did you notice that I did not actually name the annoying poster in the comments above? That's giving the offender room to gracefully absorb the criticism and decide to change, without making their entire existence the issue and the target for the everybody who wanders by.

I wrote long here for the same reason you went out and researched those posts: both of us want a better /r/Columbus. We might not agree on what that means, but could we please agree to try to minimize targeting individuals this way?   




 It's not about karma. It's about being minimally civil. 

And that's not coming from a position of cultural prudery: I'm a connoisseur of snark, and it pains me to see the low-effort, sloppily targeted crap that passes for criticism here. Politicians and major public figures, not other redditors, are the ones who deserve well-honed pointed comments. 




 She didn't ask "why are people downvoting me?". She's asking about a much broader dynamic, but you turned it into a personal attack.

Adding, the use of the term "shitpost" is a remarkably reliable indicator of a user who regards reddit as a competition among individuals rather than a forum for discussion, never mind community-building.

/r/Columbus could be so much better than it is if most of its subscribers were not intimidated out of posting. Why not put some energy into figuring out how to make that happen instead of constantly complaining? 




 That's why this question is so important. The endless downvoting of things that aren't necessarily wrong but merely reflect a different taste or opinion is a way to marginalize minority opinions and prevent participation.

Newsflash, downvote trolls:

 Personal attacks are uncalled for. 




 So these are the kind of advertisers supporting "Joe For America" -- an email list I never asked to be on and can't seem to dump. The latest mailing pitches this product, 9 mm push pins and the Geneva Bible, the guidebook for Dominionists and Reconstructionists. I thought the combination was, um, *interesting*.


 









 If you remember that with such vivid (and appropriate) bitterness, you probably also remember the brief, golden moment when Columbus readers benefited from the competition between *three* weekly alternative papers -- Alive! and Columbus Guardian being the others.

And as for bad moments in journalism: the out-of-state owners of Columbus Guardian *pulped the archives* on their way out of town, which is why many here may not remember that award-winning paper. That move was especially galling because it came on the heels of learning that those publishers, who had lured experienced reporters here from much bigger papers on the promise that they'd be on the cutting edge of the move to digital, had never bothered to digitize the archives. All that lofty talk about reclaiming serious journalism, and it turned out they were all about the widgets. 




 More relevant than that is the fact that, until today, The Dispatch was the largest family-owned daily newspaper in the US. The  two-decade trend toward concentration of ownership of print news by conglomerates that prioritize profit over civic education is now complete.

In other words, it's a wrap. The beancounters won.  




 That's [New Media *Investment Group*](http://www.newmediainv.com/section/about) to you, buddy. 

These beancounters wouldn't know journalism if it bit them on the ass. 




 One irony here is that 20 years ago, when concentration of ownership in print media was just starting to decimate the ranks of working reporters, journalists around the country were telling each other that family-owned papers, of which The Dispatch was the prime example, were the last hope for serious news reporting. Then it turned out that such papers had to compete in the same economy as those owned by soulless conglomerates with no commitment to traditional journalistic principles. That should have been predictable, but our hope was fed by desperation.  



















 I love La Chatelaine, but from the description of his kids' ages and preferences, I'm imagining a chorus of "Eew, Dad, there's *spinach* in my eggs!"

OTOH, chocolate croissants.

 Serious question: what would good formatting look like? Visitors here not noticing the sidebar is a big problem, so if there's a way to make it more likely, I'm sure it would be very welcome. 

Good luck on the portfolio review!

 It *is* linked here.

 In many/most markets, the show repeats at midnight. 




 I wore orange today, but the only orange shirt I could find says "Fund People, Not War". Hope that's an acceptable degree of mission creep... 




 The point is that *other people* will help put up the money that you don't have, once you've called a meeting or attended one that someone else has called. What's happening in your state's Bernie subreddit? In mine, a guy I never heard of before (and I've been a political activist here for a looooong time) has already set up meetings in three cities, just by online networking. 




  the answer is of course no.

The answer is "not yet". Somebody needs to take responsibility in every town and city to start a local campaign, and that involves ordering, prepaying for, and distributing/re-selling these at cost. Why wait to start that? If this campaign isn't about grassroots organizing, it's nothing. 




 Flat rate shipping is $15. Your problem here is not that you're too poor to buy from the official store, but that you're not ordering enough stuff. Can you find others in your area to put together a larger order? Maybe some local group would like to start distributing these, and you all could put together the front money for a whole pack of these items. Sooner or later *somebody* will do this in your area -- why not you, now? 




 Not for official merch that supports the campaign ... 




 No, sorry. When I have time (next month at this rate) I'll go looking. It was in some meta reddit, I think. 



















 Indeed.

["I adore lemurs," says Cleese simply, "they're extremely gentle, well-mannered, pretty and yet great fun should have married one!"](http://travography.com/lemurs/cleese.html)

Although I think the rest of us are glad he married [Connie Booth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Booth), regardless of how that (and marriages #2 and 3) ended. 




  nor does it fix the impression this person might now have of the sub or city in general.

Except in this case it did. 

And in my experience, that's pretty normal -- while willingness to make a meaningful apology is still very rare. For instance, you've now called me an "asshole" and such several times *without explaining what you mean*, and you show no inkling that this might be something that merits apology. If you can articulate what you mean, and apologize for name calling, we might have something to talk about. But even then, I'd have no idea who I'm talking to because you've erased your user history by changing names. For all anybody knows, you're one of the trolls who've been treating me unfairly for years here. Nobody has any basis to judge whether you're somebody whose criticisms are worth the time to read.

So unless you're ready to apologize for being overharsh and unspecific, we're done here.
