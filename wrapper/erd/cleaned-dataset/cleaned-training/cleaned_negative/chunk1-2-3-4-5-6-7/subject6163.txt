 whoa
 
























 planning on doing beef and cheddar next, cheers man, thanks! 




 this was a natural hog casing, I bought a small tub if it from a local butcher, comes packed in salt, all I had to do was soak it for about 15 minutes and then run water through it, it's very resilient! 




 very nice actually, big difference was texture and how much better it was to store bought sausage 
























 perfect, heading there next wednesday, I'll take you up on that advice, cheers! 




 will go back, have to do the other west coast teams, so i will definitely get a better pic, cheers!  





























 early next year for sure, dodger stadium is certainly one I'm looking forward to seeing, cheers 




 honestly, more about being there than the beer itself, haven't had a bad beer yet (although miller comes verrrry close). I teach university so I have the time and my wife is onboard with the idea though she rarely travels with me 




 yep, that's how they roll 
























 cheers man, I will do just that 




 given travel, hotel, ticket, food, beer etc... I would estimate it costs me about that much ($800) per park. Getting to visit all the parks though, priceless... 




 well, the three best beers were goose island at target field, leinenkrugel in milwaukee and it was 103 in texas, so while I don't remember what I drank, it was pretty damn tasty at the time!  
























 brilliant, very well done!
 




 third inning, worst park ever... 




 ya, they renamed again it in february, but you're right, rangers ballpark sounds better 
























 awesome!
