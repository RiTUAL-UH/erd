 Games are my passion. I love games because they are a powerful way to give someone an EXPERIENCE.  The encompass everything that movies have, charactors, story, visual effects, audio, music, lighting, etc.  AND they allow the person experiencing them to interact with the game world as if they are part of it.  The are the best outlet for my creativity short of dreaming (which unfortunately I can't share (yet =P ) ).

 I took a course on Unity3D a few months ago and I'm now employed as a game programmer.  Note, I do have about 3 years professional coding experience. 




 You are definitely on the right track.  Learning to program IS the most important thing if you want to program games.  C# is good next move.  I recommend downloading Unity3D now and start C# programming with that.  This will get you creating games right away!

Have fun and good luck!

 Education should be free and available to everyone, regardless of wealth or test scores.  All that's should be required is a desire to learn.  If we spent a tiny fraction on the amount we do on war, we could accomplish this.  We also need to remove the corrupt influence of business and self-serving politicians from the education system.  This would lift our society up more than anything we've ever tried. 




 Are you seriously arguing that we shouldn't increase the accessibly of education because some people still might not be able to afford it?!  So we should perhaps make it more difficult for "the 50%" to even things out? The more educated our society is the better off we will be, and indeed the more equality will ultimately see. 




 Why do atheists need billboards to proclaim their nonbelief? To somehow even things out?  It is absurd.  It is everyone's right to choose what they believe or don't believe. You DO NOT have to act all butthurt because your belief is not the most popular one. 




 That's some original thought you've got there.

 I find this rather presumptive of Netflix. If I'm watching Weeds I really want to watch the opening because a different band covers the opening theme in each episode.  Also there NEEDS to be an option to turn off auto play so you can watch an ep while you fall asleep. 




 What I don't understand about /atheism is why there seems to be a false dichotomy between Christians and Atheists, as if those are the only two options and that the Christian view of God is the only possible one.  Many people have belief in something they call "God" which bears no resemblance to the spiteful, meddling Man in the sky.  It seems like a straw-man argument to me.

 Other ways to make your life not suck so much:

2. Shop at a food co-op where the people are friendlier and less dead
3. Better yet, start a garden and grow your own food
4. Bike to work
5. Don't work a mind-numbing job for 50 hours a week
6. Weed

 I had a phone stolen while I was dancing a show.  When I got home, I got on my computer logged into Lookout and saw the phone was about 45 minutes away in a park.  I drove there and then it showed up as being in a house. I decided to come back in the morning and the phone registered as being in between two houses, so I went to each of them and rang the bell.  The first one was a Mom of two teenagers who swore her kids were no where near a club the night before.  The second one was an older lady.  I persuaded her to let me borrow her computer so I could show her where the phone was located.  Finally, she gave me her phone and I called my phone. We heard it ringing in the neighbor's yard next door! (The Mom of the teenagers).  I went back there and the Dad went around to the backyard and retrieved my phone.  The screen was cracked but it was still functional.  It had been locked out from too many pattern lock attempts.  I think someone tried to get it and got fed up so they threw it over the fence into these people's yard.

Amazing that I got it back, and it served me well for another year until I dropped it in my dog's water bowl.

 Actually I have met indigenous people in Ecuador and I have been to rain forests and seen first hand how the last bastions of a way of life are being destroyed in the face of a self-replicating system gone mad.  Thinking about more ecosystem destruction, more death and more extinction, more displaced people breaks my heart.  "What's the problem?" Are you seriously asking that question? 




 It is a not a criticism of Ecuador or even of China, but a criticism of a system in crisis.  Yes, Western nations have built up their wealth through the decimation of natural resources, [edit] both [/edit] domestic and abroad.  But this does not mean we should simply sit back and allow the rest of our planet's resources to be destroyed because "they did it first."  This is like raiding a store with the justification that other people have shoplifted.  We need to start thinking GLOBALLY and LONG-TERM if we are to have a future on this planet. 




 Pretty trees? How about life-sustaining oxygen and ecosystems?! Do you realize that 50% of the worlds plant and animal species live in rain forests?  Your perspective is severely misinformed. 




 How can we stop this?! 




 No. This is actually about 1/3 of the Ecuadorian rain forest.  Not all of Ecuador is covered in rain forest. 




 I was contesting the claim that intuition is a "dangerous idea".  My position is that intuition is real and can point people in the right direction when pursuing truth.  Intuition is the acquisition of information through unconscious sources. I qualify this by saying that although (or "but") it is a legitimate way of moving towards truth, it is not sufficient to serve as evidence in a legal context.  Accepting that hunches can contain truth, they still do not make good evidence because a person could simply be lying about their hunch.  The data which leads to the hunch is not readily available for the public scrutiny because it is very much a personal experience. 




 Intuition is a real and scientifically-studied phenomenon, but obviously it alone shouldn't serve as evidence.

Yes, psychedelics help us to open our eyes.  There are many paths.  Acknowledging our ignorance is the beginning of knowledge. 




 why pedobear no likey me no more =( 




 It's possible.  I was just reading about how researchers are looking at ketamine now as a potential anti-depressant at dosages lower than those used recreationally that cause hallucinations.  In that case the drug seemed to effect to NDMA receptor system.

But I really think that mushrooms in there natural state are just perfect!  Our society seems to have some sort of obsession with distilling and removing natural medicines from nature, often with unintended consequences. 




 Have you thought that maybe there is something fundamental about tripping that causes the positive psychological effects?  How can you benefit from the effects of a drug without actually experiencing the effects of the drug?

 Please show me one research paper that suggests that magic mushrooms are toxic. 




 As far as I know there are NO long term physical side effects of taking psilocybin containing mushrooms.  If anyone can find any research which indicates to the contrary, please post.

You need to be aware that frequent psychedelic usage WILL change your personality.  The effects should be mostly beneficial however. =) Also be aware that you may develop a tolerance, and the "specialness" of the experience may subside.  I suggest limiting yourself to monthly for now, since you are a new psychonaut.  Your psyche needs time to adjust to things you will find out about yourself and the universe.

 Thanks for your reply.  I don't think you're an asshole, just coming from a different perspective.

Ok cool, but that's still 100% anecdotal and completely unscientific. It means absolutely nothing to anyone other than you or your friend.

I understand you are coming at this completely from a scientific POV here, but I really don't think science is the only way to ascertain truth.  There is such a thing as intuition, and just plain observation and reasoning (which science does apply, but most of the time we do this without doing complete scientific studies).  I don't know if there are any studies comparing the prevalence of bad trips on shrooms vs. lsd, but I'd be very curious to see the results.  I do take issue with discounting personal experience completely.  I trust my own experience much more than anecdotes OR studies (which are sometimes falsified or inherently flawed).  Sometimes personal conclusions are wrong too, but at least I know I can trust myself.  This is a huge philosophical topic right here, which I'm sure we can could back and forth on all day, but honestly, do you not believe anything you learned through experience unless there are numerous, repeated, well-constructed studies about it?

but your wording implies that Psilocybin is somehow a more "true" psychedelic than others, and that the differences between psilocybin and chemicals with a similar structure or effect are inherent shortcomings in relation to psilocybin

I do think there is something to be said about the fact that mushrooms have been around on Earth for as long as we have.  [Terrance McKenna had some interesting thoughts on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZbxRzWYLc)

This is only very loosely even close to the truth. First of all, there's not just one "lock" and there's no "distorted" way for the "key" to fit.

I was speaking metaphorically.  I have a general understanding of neurotransmitters and how psychoactive drugs work.

 it just strikes me as somewhat intellectually dishonest to make a post implying that shrooms are somehow better or healthier than LSD, or that there's any relative reason to avoid LSD in the first place.

I don't have an agenda and I'm not trying to mislead people.  I encourage everyone to do their own research and trust their own experiences!  I also don't think there is anything wrong with sharing one's own experience and the thoughts that have come out of those experiences.
 




 [Shrooms can also help cure depression](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/07/magic-mushrooms-treat-depression)
It worked for me.
Just remember: mindset and setting!  And take it real easy on the dose the first time. 




 See my answer to the same question above. 




 I have a lot of experience with both, personally and anecdotally.  My experience with shrooms has been mostly positive.  I come away from the experience with a renewed sense of wonder and a deeper understanding of my place in the Universe.  I really believe that they help reveal as close to anything that can be called "truth" as possible.

LSD, on the other hand can also be a tremendously powerful experience, and many times the experience is positive, but many times it is not.  It also often leads to great feelings of "revelation".  However, it seems to me that the revelations are much more likely to be false with LSD.  A friend of mine came away feeling like there was no love in the world.  I think it often talks about the same subject as shrooms, but distorts the message.  It makes  sense physiologically for LSD to lead to false epiphanies when you consider that is has a very similar molecular structure to psilocybin.  It's as if it is another key that turns the same lock, but always in some sort of distorted way.

And since this is r/conspiracy, I'll just remind people that [the CIA experimented with LSD in the 1960's as a method of mind-control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra).

 That is not correct. ac - bc = (a-b)c. Always.  10x - 0.9 = 9.01 doesn't make any sense.  What happened to the x on the 10?  You treated it as 1 in that case?  There is no other way to evaluate it besides to 9x.

 When society and media constantly tell you something about yourself, you start to believe it.  When I was about 6 my sister and I got into an argument and she called me a "girl" as an insult.  To get even, I called her a "boy" and she shrugged and said she didn't mind being called a boy.  Made me realize some things about society and status right then.

 Guess what. B12 doesn't come from meat either. It comes from bacteria. 




 No... I subtracted x.  I defined x to equal .9 which is perfectly legal to do.  So you agree up to 10x = 9.9, right?  So 10x - x = 9x and 9.9 - x = 9.  Make sense? 




 I posted another proof above.  It's not a mathematical fallacy.  Here is my proof: 
let x = .9_(repeating), multiply both sides by 10: 10x = 9.9_, subtract x from both sides: 9x = 9, and divide by 9 giving: x = 1, therefore: 1 = .9_

Oh and here is the wikipedia article explaining more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999... 




 Here is another proof.
let x = .99999(repeating),
multiply both sides by 10:
10x = 9.99999(repeating),
subtract x from both sides:
9x = 9,
and divide by 9 giving:
x = 1,
therefore:
1 = .999999(repeating) 




 You are missing my point entirely.  I'm not saying that we one needs to be physically capable of killing an animal to eat it.  What I am saying is that one should be emotionally responsible for their own actions.  When people buy meat in a store that comes from a factory farm they are completely removed from the process that produced the meat and have no idea what sort of suffering was endured.  At least when someone raises and slaughters an animal on their own, they are well aware of what they are doing.  Tribal societies honored the life the animals they killed and treated them with respect.  Animals "raised" for food today are  treated with no respect and in fact are treated legally as property rather than living, sentient beings.  That is fucked. 




 You hit the nail on the head.  The intense anger reaction is because they are NOT comfortable with their own actions.  And you are calling attention to it. 




 Everybody is is saying "oh, it's not so bad! could be worse!" But why are we assuming that it is our right or necessity to eat chicken in the first place?  This is just a small sampling of the torture animals have to endure under factory farming.  I think if you want to eat animals you should be comfortable with killing the animal yourself.  Don't leave it to a big industrialized process that has no regard for humane practices and also leaves you completely removed from the process that delivers the meat to your plate.  I'm not saying no one should ever eat meat, but the way it is done in modern society is completely out of control.  It's literally destroying the planet, destroying people's health, and leaving a trail of misery and suffering along the way. 




 How about, if you want to eat chicken, you kill it yourself.

 A new world is literally a new world and an opportunity to do things completely differently.  Since we are approaching it from somewhere else we can do things after careful though and examination.  No need to rush in to things and much it up.

The very first things we should do is take inventory of the entire planet.   Where are the resources concentrated?  What areas are most suitable of habitation?  The entire thing should be in a database in a computer system so we can use algorithms to help make informed decisions.  We also have an opportunity to switch to renewable energy.  If we concentrate our efforts we can produce a network of a 100% renewable sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, tidal, etc.

Our goal should be to live an existence that both allows us to thrive and doesn't disrupt the lives of the billions of other species of life on the planet.  Sustainability is key.  We should absolutely leverage the power of machines to do all sorts of repetitive tasks.  I imagine that each city could have an automated garden which would automatically grow and harvest the sustenance we need.

These are just some quick brainstormed ideas, but the point is this would be the perfect opportunity to do things right.  All it would take is the will to work together.

 Are you implying that smoking marijuana "lowers your senses"? Are you missing a "don't" from your statement?  Otherwise it sounds like you are saying that people mistakenly do drugs in order to lower their senses and that the way to remain with lowered senses is to not do drugs. Some might agree with this. 




 ADD is defined by the DSM5 as a psychiatric disorder:
http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/ADHD%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf
In order to "have" ADD one must meet 6 criteria from a small list of behaviors.  Can your behaviors change? Yes. So can you just "get" ADD? According to its definition and that logic, yes.  If you were objecting to my usage of my term at all because you don't feel it is useful or helpful to refer to the meeting of these criterion as a disorder, then we agree!  I simply used it for fun in more of a tongue-in-cheek manner like gay people affectionately call each other "fairies".

Also, there is a lot of ongoing research investigating the neurological effects that the internet may have on our brains: http://www.today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/PRN-081015_gary-small-ibrain.aspx
As all repetitive experience does, it has measurable effects on the brain, and very likely changes our behavior, even if in minute subtle ways.  I think this is actually fascinating and I think about the prospects of societies neurological structure changing on a mass scale.  Perhaps something like a new phase of humanity?!

As for marijuana, I know at least some research has indicated a higher prevalence of pot smoking among those with ADD.  Of course, CORRELATION DOES NOT IMPLY CAUSATION.  It could well be that people who have those symptoms just also happen to like smoking pot =) (Or any other number of explanations.)  But it does seem like some of the things on the ADD list are quite similar to some of the things on the "marijuana intoxication" list.  I think similarly of the internet usage, these changes are not "good" or "bad" or "orderly" or "disorderly" (unless your talking about relative to the status quo, but that's a whole 'nother discussion.)  These characteristics just are, but they can makes a really big difference in the way we live our lives!

Now I'll speak of my personal experience.  I am diagnosed with ADD and I always felt like many of my behaviors weren't detrimental at all, but simply annoying to teachers, like standing in class, and asking tangential questions.  Other behaviors I did want to change, like failing to finish things I was excited to start, and have been pretty successful at doing so.  I smoke pot and I have fun and I get things done.

TL;DR Think about it.

 Once in a dream I had a someone show up in my bedroom and asks me to follow him.  He flew out the window and I followed him.  He took me to the backroom of some building where there was a meeting going on.  It was a secret lucid dreamers alliance meeting!

In another dream, I tried to go back there by flying to the building.  I went in through the front which was filled with offices and cubicles.  I tried to make my way to the back where the meeting was and a woman in a suit came out and told me I couldn't go back there.  I told her I had to find out if it were real.  At this point she produced a pistol and pointed it at me! She said forcefully "IT WASN'T REAL"!

It seems to me like there are some dream figure who want the truth to be known (the liberators) and others who want to suppress the truth about the dream state. 




 He went out with a bang. 




 Except for the people for don't and actually do the things they say they will do.  We exist. 









 This is absolute nonsense.  Anyone who has experienced a lucid dream knows this cannot be true because they have been conscious WITHIN the dream and can recall the narrative.  Lucid dreaming has been scientifically verified by researcher Steven LeBerge who was able to signal from within a dream using a series of eye movements.

Here's part two of the interview:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08zNQ_wO0D8 




 REM sleep gets longer as the night goes on, and it can range from 5 minutes to over 90 at the end of the night.  This is why you have your best chance to have a lucid dream at the end of your sleep cycle, and also the longest (lucid) dreams.  Personally, I've had lucid dreams so long I could barely remember how they started and were way too long and detailed to write down completely.

One technique I've learned for extending a dream I feel slipping away is the SPIN technique.  Try spinning in circles.  Often times when you stop you will wake up in a completely different setting.

 I'm not sure about Skyrim because I haven't played any other Elder Scrolls games, but I thought Human Revolution was great.  What about it did you think was a huge step backwards?  I don't think that using a game engine necessarily means you will end up with a better game, but at least it allows you to theoretically devote more time and resources to other parts of the game, like story, level design, etc.  Maybe companies just drop the ball sometimes because they are afraid to take risks and try to appeal to the lowest common denominator?

 Can we please remember that human health is not the only factor to consider when we ask "Are GMOs a good idea." What about the environmental implications? And why is the burden of proof on the people with concerns to prove that there may be problems.  Where are the in-depth long-term environmental studies before we introduce a new species into the ecosystem.  I don't believe we can guarantee that these fish will NEVER escape their farms and will not breed with wild salmon, fundamentally altering the entire ocean's ecosystem.  There is no turning back from that.  Shouldn't we abide by the precautionary principle and not rush into this?!

 So people shouldn't have the right to make informed decisions because... why? 




  It is the Governments of the world allowing things like patenting genes, letting those patents and copyrights exist for a significant amount of time, and making it illegal for farmers to re-use the seed, even if they don't care whether or not the engineered genes survived. If gene patents died out after say, 5 to 10 years, there wouldn't be as much of an issue.

Hmm.. well what happens when you have the same people working for the big corporations that work for the government and go back and forth between them?  [Take a look at this chart](http://occupy-monsanto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/individual_monsanto_federal_position-large.jpg) and tell me that Monsanto isn't at least partially (if not mostly) responsible for the completely unregulated GMO playground.

 There are numerous well-documented studies which provide evidence of fluorides harmful effects on the human body and brain.

You can find a complete compilation of these studies at:
http://www.fluoridealert.org/fluoride-dangers/health/index.aspx

Ill give a summary of the most important findings:

**Brain Damage**

it is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain.
SOURCE: National Research Council. (2006). Fluoride in Drinking Water: A Scientific Review of EPA's Standards. National Academies Press, Washington D.C. p 187.

Studies in animals and human populations suggest that fluoride exposure, at levels that are experienced by a significant proportion of the population whose drinking water is fluoridated, may have adverse impacts on the developing brain. Though no final conclusions may be reached from available data, the findings are provocative and of significant public health concern.

SOURCE: Schettler T, et al. (2000). Known and suspected developmental neurotoxicants. pp. 90-92. In: In Harms Way - Toxic Threats to Child Development. Greater Boston Physicians for Social Responsibility: Cambridge, MA. (See report)

As of now, there are 18 human studies indicating that fluoride exposure is associated with lower IQs in children.  This is after controlling for other facturs which are associated with differences in IQ such as lead exposure and family income.  Some excepts:

These negative correlations between IQ and urinary As and between IQ and urinary fluoride indicate that exposure to high levels of As or fluoride, or both, could affect childrens intelligence... This study indicates that exposure to fluoride in drinking water is associated with neurotoxic effects in children.
SOURCE: Wang SX, et al. (2007). Arsenic and fluoride exposure in drinking water: children's IQ and growth in Shanyin county, Shanxi province, China. Environmental Health Perspectives 115(4):643-7.

Conclusion: High fluoride burden has a definite effect on the intellectual and physical development of children.
SOURCE: Wang S, et al. (2005). Effects of coal burning related endemic fluorosis on body development and intelligence levels of children. Journal of Applied Clinical Pediatrics 20(9): 897-898.

**Cancer**

There are many in-vitro laboratory studies which show that fluroide is a mutagenic compound, meaning it causes changes in DNA.  Many mutagenics are also carcinogenic.  One study even found that primates are more sensitive to the mutagenic effects than rats.
See: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7679201?dopt=Abstract

Other findings:

As cells were exposed to higher doses of fluoride, the percentage of L-02 cells with DNA damage increased. This result is consistent with other studies... Therefore, considereing previous studies, we think that fluoride can cause lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and apoptosis, and that there is a positive relationship among these changes.
SOURCE: Wang AG, et al. (2004). Effects of fluoride on lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and apoptosis in human embryo hepatocytes. Biomedical and Environmental Sciences 17: 217-22.

**Bone Fractures and Bone Disease**

There is a well-known arthritic bone disease known as Skeletal fluorosis caused by excessive fluoride intake. Images: warning! may disturb you  

Many studies show that fluoride weakens bones:

In A/J strain, we found significant decreases in stiffness with increasing fluoride dose treatment. There was a significant difference between the treatment group 0 ppm and 100 ppm... In the A/J strain, there was a decrease in ultimate load with increasing fluoride dose treatment, with significant differences between the treatment group 0 ppm and the treatment group 100 ppm (p=0.017).

SOURCE: Mousny M, et al. (2006). The genetic influence on bone susceptibility to fluoride. Bone Aug 18; [Epub ahead of print]

The highest fluoride intake (50 mg/L) significantly diminished vertebral strength... This impairment of mineralization by fluoride appeared to be the primary cause of the diminished vertebral strength.

SOURCE: Turner CH, et al. (2001). Combined effects of diets with reduced calcium and phosphate and increased fluoride intake on vertebral bone strength and histology in rats. Calcified Tissue International 69: 51-57.

These are just some of the documented health-impairments associated with ingesting fluoride.  Others include:
**Dental Fluorosis** (yellowingof the teeth due to too much fluoride).  I have this!  as does 32% of American children according to the Center for Disease Control
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5403a1.htm

**Pineal and Thyroid gland impairment**  These glands are extremely important in regulating all types of normal body operations like emitting hormones and important neurotransmitters.  According to this study, the pineal gland is the primary target of fluoride accumulation within the body.

 The only way I know of is deonization with Ion Exchange Resins.  Read about filters that remove fluoride here: http://fluoridealert.org/content/water_filters/ 




 Mostly true, except that kids have allowance and lunch money, and are offered soda and fast food as options in the lunch room.  Also, don't underestimate the power of children to get their way with parents who don't want to be the bad guy.

 Well, you see, complexity is subjective, that's the nature of emergence. What's complex for a child like you is often trivial or routine for a scientist like me. Reddit's userbase is quite diverse, although there seems to be evidence of an over-representation of individuals exhibiting childish behaviors.
Secondly, do you really think this situation has been has been oversimplified? It's through using "copypastas" and other hasty generalizations you try to cram each individual scenario with its particularities into a formulaic mold. I hypothesize you require this simplification because of the state of your mental faculties and reasoning skills.
And lastly, most of the time your simplifications do not aid in understanding new facets of the subject matter. Characterizations that might not be 100% accurate can act as useful models for understanding overarching facets of complex inter-dependent systems, but your "copypastas" do not facilitate in that endeavor.
If even one of these criticisms is valid, your point is moot as it depends unilaterally on all the three premises I've highlighted. The social commentary you wish "copypastas" to exhibit might seem sensible, maybe even profound to you, but they're just as bad, if not worse than the additions reactiongifs, pun chains or novelty accounts bring to the table. Please consider this seriously, and don't immediately fall back on your preconceived notions without reexamining their validity, at least in a cursory manner after I've presented you with this new evidence you really should take seriously.

 Yes, I think if the gov knows about ET life and is withholding such information, it's probably at a higher security level than the people being trained by NSA to do social engineering. 




 The UFO pictures are on pages 35-37 of [the document](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/), right in between a Whole Foods sign and a slide maybe talking about advancing technology. We can only speculate about what the pictures were meant to illustrate. 




 Kucinich was good too, but unfortunately the media assassinated him. 




 The solution to all of this is to reorganize society from the ground up. Hyper-local, and online communities with their own internal organization, which can in turn organize into meta-communities like cells of a body.  Community gardens, new forms of communes that embrace the good side of technology.  Any way that we can help each other become self-sufficient.  The more we do this the less we will rely on the status-quo system.  We will cease paying taxes.  No one will elect to go to war.

This is the way out. 




 *I will not downvote or deride others for challenging my assertions or asking for additional evidence.  Instead I will see it as an opportunity to both educate, and reevaluate my own assumptions.  Ultimately, everyone will come away from the discussion more informed, and hopefully one step closer to Truth.*

*I will actively combat my own confirmation bias by deliberately seeking viewpoints different than my own.  I will critically evaluate all evidence presented, whether it confirms or challenges my current beliefs.  For I understand that there are no "sides".  Only what is true and what is untrue.*

*I will humble myself enough to admit when I am wrong.  There is no shame in changing my mind in light of new information.  My goal is not only to guide others towards realization, but also myself.*

*The process of investigating with dedication and integrity will serve to make all of us ever-more informed, ever-more discerning, and always moving towards the Truth.* 




 I hear ya!  I know that the last thing that someone who is having a hard time wants her hear is that it's their "fault" or anything like that.  I certainly don't want to imply that anyone deserves to be in pain and don't think problems just go away by snapping your fingers.  However, I do believe that changing your attitude towards believing in yourself and focusing on the positive aspects of your life is often prerequisite for fixing those problems.  You can be totally and completely right about how much crap has come your way, but if that's all you think and talk about, it really isn't going to get any better.  We've got to keep focused on that glimmer of hope, the 5% that is working, until it gets bigger and bigger.

It's interesting you mention science, because I feel like the completely materialistic (meaning concerning the material world) and "objective" world view we've adopted is actually an obstacle for many people to come out of the view that the world sucks.  Things are rarely so cut and dry as a laboratory and subjective experience is much more pertinent to our lives.  I know this is a whole philosophical can of worms.  Also, I disagree that worrying really ever serves a useful purpose.  We can certainly address things that come up without getting bogged down in worst-case scenarios.  Like John Lennon said "There are no problems, only solutions!"

You're totally right about that last point! The best thing you can do is to just be happy and help others be happy too! =)

EDIT: Oh, and for the record. I used to be extremely depressed for many years.  Nothing changed about my life except my philosophy and my attitude.  I'm speaking from my personal experience.

 Here's the trouble with this question.  Most of the big lies are so ingrained in people's minds, in fact the way we think, that is nearly impossible to distinguish them as lies.

The one that comes to my mind is the idea that life sucks or is really hard.  I hear this all the time from people who feel like they've had it rough.  It's almost always a self-fulfilling prophesy.  Yes we have problems here on Earth, but the attitude with which we approach these problems makes all the difference.  Unlearn the lie that life is hard, and you'll find it's actually really easy and fun!

 Ok, we know it is happening. Let's talk about how we can fight back.  There is no possible way systematically defaming political dissidents threw libel, fraud, and "false flag" attacks can be legally justified.  Somehow this should end up in the Supreme Court.  Of course we shouldn't rely on that corrupt bunch to stop this, but a legal fight would certainly bring it to the public's attention.  Right now they are just doing this in the shadows.  We need to force them to defend what they are doing so it can be met with the scrutiny it deserves.

This is just one idea. Let's hear some strategies for subverting the subversion of free discourse on the internet!

 Except that there are actually emotions which are expressed nearly universally across animal species.

 From comments on the article:

There are 75 community gardens on about 23 acres of land scattered throughout the city of Seattle, serving roughly 4500 gardeners. These plots, called p-patches, are open to the public and neither fenced nor guarded. Homeless people often camp next to our patch, and they've never taken anything from the garden to my knowledge (though it's so abundant that a bit of pilferage would be hard to detect). In general, theft from Seattle gardens is very rare, so I would expect the same to be true of the Beacon Food Forest. I'm sure the city will post signs clearly stating that taking more than a single family can consume or selling produce is forbidden. You'd be very surprised how law-abiding people are here.

 I actually had this experience while on Ayahuasca.  It was very scary indeed and I was thinking "what a dumb way to die! forgetting how to inhale."  Of course I started breathing again.  The shaman also assured me that my body would not do that to me and I would inevitably find my breath again.  I guess the best thing to do is to remember this, you will start breathing again.

 Just because there are two possible outcomes to something doesn't mean they are equally likely.  Your chance of picking the right door out of a thousand is .1%  The chance of it being the wrong door is the inverse of that (100 - .1)%.

Here's another way to put it: Today you can either die or not die.  Is the chance that you will die today 50/50?  Is the chance that will die on  any day that is not today 50/50?

 [Khaleesi](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Khaleesi) is a title for the female leader of a Khalasar (the wife of the Khal).  Like "Queen". So characters, particularly the Dothraki, address her as such.  But as has been said before, you wouldn't use her title without an article (a, the) to refer to such a person in the third person (i.e. "Queen looks very lovely in her elegant gown").

 Upsagans for you, good sir! 




 So brave. 




 Your post is so arrogant and assumptive it's not really even worth replying to, but here goes.

But the GMO labeling initiative is not in any way meant to inform or educate consumers. It's meant to mislead and scaremonger.

This is not a fact, it's an assumption.  The people who rally and petition to get GMO labeling laws on the ballots care very much about consumer knowledge.  Calling GMOs "GMOs" is not in any way misleading.  If the industry is proud of their product why are they afraid to let people know what it is?  You would think they would wear the label with pride.

Mandatory labeling doesn't necessarily imply a "huge health risk".  It implies that people should be free to make their own decisions for a variety of different reasons.  It has nothing to do with how safe the industry-funded studies say it is.  As I said before, there are a variety of reasons someone might want to avoid GMOs.  We don't need to go point by point on those reasons.  It's about having the knowledge necessary to make personal decisions about what to put in ones own body AND what industry practices we want to encourage with our dollars.  **Saying that people shouldn't have the right to know what they are eating because they don't know what's good for themselves is EXTREMELY arrogant.**

Then you quoted some arguments for labeling in the bill, but offered no refutation of those points, just said it was "propaganda".  Ok, well that's like your opinion, man.

How is slapping a sticker on something that says "GMO" going to solve the problem of GMO ignorance?

Well, for one it's going to let people know that they are and have been eating GMO foods for years.  Make of that what you will.  Most people don't even know what GMOs are.  When they see it labeled they are going to go home and look it up, and then it will be up to them to decide if it's something they want to buy or not.  If you are a proponent of GMOs, the best thing you can do is to make your case for them honestly and out in the open.  Not just hope that people never realize what they are eating.

You obviously didn't read the article I linked to, so whatever.

Now, looking through your post history reveals that your entire account is devoted to pro GMO posting. 2,831 comments and every single one about GMOs.  Now tell us something honestly.  Are you paid to do this? 




 Do you know if VT's law will count as a state towards enacting CT's law? 




 The potential problem with labeling GMOs is that the vast majority of consumers are not educated on them.

You are contradicting yourself with this statement.  You are saying that because most people don't know about GMOs, we shouldn't notify people about GMOs.  Don't you think that if people realized that nearly everything they buy in the store contains GMOs they will be more likely to educate themselves about them?  How is not labeling going to solve the problem of GMO ignorance? It's not.

Moreover, health concerns aren't the only reason people are concerned about GMOs. What about the fact that [pesticide use is increasing due to GMOs](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/02/us-usa-study-pesticides-idUSBRE89100X20121002)?  What about the concerns that GMOs further encourage monoculture farming, something which many believe we need to move away from for the sake of the environment?

Those with concerns about GMOs and their impact on our planet might be more educated than you think.

 True.  But NotSoSlenderMan gets the joke.  It clicks in his brain, but he doesn't laugh.  Humor is a funny thing. 




 Just spent a few minutes searching for a video of Mitch telling jokes to Tupac, thinking it must have been some defining moment in his career.. then I got it. 




 Understanding why something is funny has little to do with finding it funny.  You should have said "I guess I don't find it funny."

I don't understand what you are implying. 




 You do realize that the "JIDF" picked that name for themselves, right?  It's a perfect example of what I was talking about above.  Zionists trying to speak on behalf of all Jews to legitimize their cause. 




 This is just sick! 




 SKANK SKANK SKANK SKANK SKANK SKANK SKANK!!!! 




 Guess what. There are some racist people on /r/conspiracy[1] , just as there are some racist people in every subreddit, and probably every subculture in the world. I call them out when I see them. Not everyone, or even most people, on there are racist. You can cherry pick examples of ugliness from any subreddit. What is the point of doing this? Seriously? 




 Dude said..
we want to be there to ensure that [wikipedia articles] are balanced and Zionist in nature.


Does he see the irony in that statement? 




 Ever hear of the [Streisand effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)?
EDIT: This was supposed to be in reply to salvia_d above. 




 /r/conspiracy is really struggling to walk this fine line.  The problem arises from Zionism being so conflated with Judaism, by Zionist themselves, as well as its critics.  We all know that criticism of Israel doesn't equate to "antisemitism" (anti-Judaism).  It becomes confusing because of the Zionist's insistence that it does, which is really presumptuous on their part because there are MANY jews who either actively oppose Zionism, or just don't care that much one way or the other.  Further, many people do in fact use the "anti-Zionism does not equal antisemitism" defense to say things which actually ARE anti-jewish.  I see it on this subreddit all the time and it becomes really exhausting to call it out all the time (while usually being downvoted for doing so). 




 Because there were no wars before Israel?  I'm sorry, I'm the first to criticize the Israeli government for its policies of discrimination, aggression, etc. but this sort of hyperbole is really not helping. 




 I'll just say that in chess, if you resign your chance of winning becomes 0%.  Also the unpredictability of the future is our friend. 




 I don't buy any of this crap. 














 You correctly identified the challenges, but why ever start with the premise that a problem "won't be solved"? These certainly are big challenges and it does look like the cards are stacked against us, but we can and WILL overcome. I will never believe that humanity is doomed to slavery.  We just need to start thinking outside the box and taking bold action.

Companies are legally responsible for maximizing profit to shareholders, not sharing the profits with workers or hiring more workers

This is true of corporations, and this is why we should avoid working for corporations.  Join or start a workers coop!  I've seen some very successful ones, for instance, look at the rise of credit unions as an alternative to commercial banks.  What's to stop worker's collectives from advancing in every single industry if we have the will to do it?

Globalization has merely made all human labor cheaper as jobs now compete with slave labor (it's unbelievable wrong that slavery still exists in the year 2014... yet slaves make our clothes, our ipads, etc.)

So stop buying crap.  Commit to buying/trading/gifting locally with people you know.  You'll end up with really unique stuff that you treasure and that you know that no one suffered to make.

Technology continues to reduce the need of human labor

This is actually a really good thing!  It's only under our current system that technology (which is really just efficiency) becomes a hardship for people.  Doing things with less effort is a good thing.  I can image a world where machine produce our food and other goods in sustainable ways and leaves humans to innovate and relax.  Learn DIY technology and you'll be taking the power back.

The rise of the sociopath... the system of profits over social good/contribution rules the day now.

It starts with you.  Change your own life and you begin transforming society.  Transform society and you begin to change people's psychology.

Debt ... finally the big one. When you spend more than you have for a long time, you eventually destroy growth. A person would have declared bankruptcy and started fresh, but a gov with $17T of debt can't declare bankruptcy. With no room for more debt (beyond the rate at which it will rise already) there's basically no money to drive any kind of growth initiatives or more importantly create confidence that things are going to be 'ok' for the next 30 years (which spurs investment).

When people rely less on the pervasive system to meet their everyday needs, money will slowly lose its importance.  This may take a really long time or it may happen very quickly.  In the meantime a political movement to alleviate people from debt would be a big help.

**TL;DR: There is hope.  Think creatively!** 




 Yes it is. 




 Dude... don't tell me how "Jews" operate.  Say all you want about Zionists, people with a political agenda, but when you go throwing the word "Jew" around you come off sounding like a bigoted prick.  Not all jews are Zionists and many are adamantly anti-Zionist.  If you read the article posted you would understand that. 




 Shrooms are still legal in Holland? I thought they were banned after a drunk/tripping French girl threw herself off a bridge in '07. 




 This news of Israel dropping fluoride is undoubtedly a good thing.  Most of the Israeli population is manipulated by their government just like any other nation.  An awakening of Israeli consciousness will help them to understand and challenge the atrocities going on in their name.  I don't think removing fluoride means they are gearing up for more war.  The Israeli government has no problem starting wars as is. 




 I thought this was [relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ythrdCsOFJU) 




 If fluoride makes people docile and apathetic, and removing it makes them aggressive, why is the most aggressive country in the world, the USA, fluoridated? 




 Americans won't get off their asses to protest being spied on in every conceivable way, but they will to defend their right to stream movies?  Well, maybe. 




 Instructions unclear: penis stuck in Le Nice MayMay Man 




 Instructions unclear: mind stuck on this silly meme 




 Fair enough.  See my reply to /u/NegativeGhostwriter below.  Thanks for replying with actual evidence instead of just ignoring/downvoting me.  I would really like to continue to investigate things with a skeptic such as yourself, and perhaps we can take a look at some other claims.  In the future I'll do my own debunking before submitting bodies of evidence to others (especially skeptics).

Everybody has confirmation bias.  The only way to approach truth is through a constant challenging of beliefs by others who with different world views.  I think a subreddit devoted to theorists and skeptics doing just this in a friendly matter would be awesome.  I (and many other people who challenge widely-accepted assumptions) really am committed to finding the truth, wherever that may lead.  Let's work together on that. 




 When I first posted my link I was downvoted immediately without anyone posting any sort of rebuttal.  That's why I wrote my edit.  I'm happy /u/Tony_AbbottPBUH actually replied with some real information and I spend a lot of time looking through the NIST documents.  He seems to be right that some of the information in the link I posted seems to have no valid source.  I am perfectly capable of seeing this and admitting when I am wrong.  I am not an expert on everything 9/11, and in fact, I haven't been 100% convinced with any version of the events.  I am committed to truth and I challenge myself and others.  Do not make assumptions about me (or anyone) please. 




 Uptoked. 









 Discredited by whom?  Why don't you try addressing the content of the article instead of using ad hominems? 




 [Here is a link to the Snowden interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhS9aB-qgU). I'm watching it now before I form an opinion.

EDIT: It's actually kind of sad how you guys are more interested in jerking each other off while confirming your own preconceived notions than having anything close to resembling an actual discussion, debate, or exchange of information and ideas. 




 I just made an account to say this, and I'm hijacking the top comment to say this, and I'm probably going to be downvoted for this but...

Upvote me. 




 Can't we just have something genuinely uplifting around here for a change? 




 He's also started extending the range of the light spectrum that he can hear.  He can now perceive UV and IR light.  Pretty darn cool (and useful?). 




 He talks about it in the video linked to in the article.  I was really hoping you'd be able to train yourself to have that sense even after you remove the sensor. 




 You're saying that one can't criticize or advocate independence from corporations if they've ever once used a service or purchased a product from one?  That's pretty a pretty absurd sentiment.  Following that logic it would be "hypocritical" to petition for any sort of governmental change if you've ever walked down a road paved by tax money. 




 So? 




 Take your life into your own hands.  Yes, the system is completely corrupt. You can not rely on your politicians, your "leaders", your government, or your corporations.  You can only rely on yourself and your community.  (Choose your community wisely.)

The way to freedom is through self-sufficiency.  Learn to grow your own food.  If you can produce your own power, even better.  Find the right people to band together with and build a life that depends less and less on the existing power structure.

When people do this in mass, and the state is fading to irrelevancy, it will have one last death throe where it tries with all it's might to cling to power.  But once the illusion of power is broken, there will really be nothing for them to do but die.  Then we will be free.  It all starts with taking matters into our own hands.  It starts with you! 









 Sometimes they are brown. 




 Quick point: not all apples are red. 




 You said it yourself. They don't share information.  Next question: what is the FBI looking for? 




 I'm trying to find the source for the super high resolution capabilities of spy satellites.  That they exist at all is [very well documented](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance_satellite) and is [confirmed by former DIA-aget Russel Tice](https://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2013/06/19/podcast-show-112-nsa-whistleblower-goes-on-record-reveals-new-information-names-culprits/).  Now think about how clearly you can make out a car in Google Earth, and this is just what is publicly available.  They've spent billions of dollars on this technology.  I'll keep looking for a source for the candy bar wrapper claim. 




 There are [17 different spy agencies in the Unites States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community)!  If they were all sharing data there would be absolutely no need to do a low level flyover like this.  At least one agency has satellites capable of reading the label off of a candy bar from space. 




 What I don't understand is, why do they have to do this when they have the capability to monitor us from space with spy satellites?  According to Russel Tice, a whistle blower, former DIA analyst, and satellite systems specialist they have the capability to read the label off a candy bar on the ground from space.  The only explanation I can think of is that the FBI doesn't have this capability itself.  In fact, we have 17 different "intelligence" agencies in the United States and there  must be a lot of redundancy. 




 It's even tougher than just fighting special interests groups.  Take a look at [this graph](http://occupy-monsanto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/individual_monsanto_federal_position-large.jpg) showing the overlap of Monsanto employees and government officials.  The government literally IS the special interest group! 




 Very interesting part is at the end of the article:

Nassim Taleb, professor of risk engineering at New York University and author of best-sellers 'The Black Swan' and 'Fooled by Randomness,' recently said that GMOs have a very real ability to cause "an irreversible termination of life at some scale, which could be the planet." Talebs thesis basically stems from the fact that GMOs come from laboratory alterations rather than natural processes, and that humans cannot understand that with each modified seed, the potential for total ecocide increases.

"There is no comparison between the [bottom-up] tinkering of selective breeding and the top-down engineering of taking a gene from an organism and putting it into another, Taleb and colleagues say in a draft of their research.

"The planet took about close to zero risks of ecocide in trillions of variations over 3 billion years, otherwise we would not have been here."

 Oh.  Who thinks that? 




 Just because you're trying to separate truth from lies about a disagreeable topic doesn't mean you are a "fan" of that topic.  For instance, I don't like soft drinks, but if someone said that Coca Cola contains donkey piss, I would call them out on that.  I'm not defending coke, but defending truth.  There are plenty of valid reasons to criticize the soft drink industry without inventing any.  Please try to move beyond black and white thinking and you'll be helping our cause.

 They're an interpretation.

Some ~~psychoanalysis~~ *psychological interpretations* of these dreams:

Little man mowing your facial hair symbolizes man's struggle to tame nature. Just as we trim back the wilderness, the modern man must also strive to tame his own inner beast through the rituals of grooming.


Child's head literally inside the man. The inner child longs to break through and say hello.


Tiny little people escape with your heart. In a world were everything is up for grabs, and we fear the loss of economic stability, our greatest fear is to lose our heart, our humanity.


The invisible bicycle fulfills the wish for mobility and stealth.


Changing the batteries on your hands is a psychological indication that we are moving towards the singularity. Technology is becoming more and more an extension of one's own self. We are witnessing the blurring of the lines of the body and machine.


The camera head man takes photos through a human head. When we constantly see the world from behind a camera lens, it becomes difficult to distinguish which is the tool and which is the operator.
The changing of a head like a light bulb is a similar theme to above.


Bathing in a hot cup of coffee like a nice refreshing swim to wake you up in the morning. We soak and bask in the buzzing of the caffeine-ridden brain, a modern comfort and way of life.


Lugging around your own giant head perfectly exemplifies the conundrum of our left-brain dominated society. We fear we exist too much in the head, and it weighs down our heart. 




 It's a sad state of affairs when we don't allow ourselves to even dream.

 Well.. when I think back about all the time I've spend watching this series, my fondest memories are from the very beginning.  The first episode filled me with awe and wonder at the huge magical world engrossing me. The scope and scale of it were staggering.  Every character was immediately intriguing. I had a friend (a book reader) who would stop every few minutes and explain in a little more detail what was going on.  I was so curious and had so many questions!  I still remember my heart pounding when I saw Bran fall.

I've introduced so many people to this show and I always love rewatching the first few eps. 




 So you weren't already sitting down to watch the episode when they started? 









 Safe limits huh? Tell that to my dental fluorosis. 




 what's interesting about it? 




 OMG, at least credit [the artist](http://therealmcgee.tumblr.com/)! 




 I hope they use it next season when talking about Tywin's death. 




 I hope there is a Tysha reveal in the books.  Maybe Martin will even do it just to spite D D for changing things! 




 How about a third chance?! This book sounds perfect for me! 




 Hello!  I'm looking for some help troubleshooting starting my engine.  First of all, I can rule out the battery, the glow plugs, and the starter.  All are new and just replaced.  I also just attempted to replace the fuel filter because I had a suspicion that the fuel is not flowing properly.  When I got to the step about bleeding air from the fuel by opening the air valve and cranking the engine, nothing came out of the hose.  Any help would be appreciated.  I can take pics and report back as needed. Thanks! 




 Yeah, I've already read the wikipedia article, thanks.  The blog has a link to a ["document"](http://www.jfklancer.com/CIA.html) hosted on a site called jfklancer.com. It's titled "CIA Document 1035-960 Concerning Criticism of the Warren Report".  When you google that all you find are more blog posts, but nothing that indicates that this is an official document. 




 What?  You're the one who made the claim, I'm asking for a source. 




 I've heard this before, and it makes sense, but I can't find a source to back this up. Can you help? 




 (I upvoted you for the reasons you stated above.) 




 Where is the announcement thread? 




 Or Margery pops up and says "Oh look the pie!" 




 Considering that scene is not in the books, it kept me on the edge of my seat as well!
(It's not a spoiler to say something that's NOT in the books right?) 




 No one expec.... ah nevermind. 









 Good question.  Beric was sent out by Ned, but the Brotherhood Without Banners swear allegiance to no king. 




 Yeah, what's happening to Theon after book two is only implied, but not seen in ASOS.  So when they showed all that stuff in Season 3/4 about what was happening to him I was pretty shocked, having only read up to AFFC at the time.  I don't think the "Reek"/Theon thing is mentioned in the books until ADWD. 




 Theon, for one. 




 I don't want 13 episodes and here's why:
They are already plowing through the books (with book 5 plotlines of Daenerys and Theon).  More episodes means more time for them to fill and more invented stuff.  Generally the plotlines that HBO writes are really weak compared to what is in the books.  So more episodes would probably mean more of that stuff.  I don't think they will start including more characters from the books because they are concerned that the show is already too complicated for most people to keep track.

 Show producers should spend more time reading our subreddit to find all their inconsistencies! 




 There already is a thread for show vs. book discussion.  Also the mods posted something recently about how book readers should react to guesses that are correct.  Basically, just ignore them. 




  #samforking 




 I'm not being a D is and this is not just a semantical argument.  If one is interested in driving a "zero emission" vehicle it's probably because they care about their carbon footprint and they have real concerns about their environmental impact.  How the electricity is actually generated is of paramount importance.  The point in the production and distribution of the energy where the fossil fuels are burned (where the emissions happen) is actually the irrelevant thing. 




 This is good, but this article refers to these vehicles as "zero emissions" which is a bit misleading.  Just because there's no tail pipe doesn't mean that nothing is being burned in the process of powering your vehicle.  Considering that [66.5%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._2013_Electricity_Generation_By_Type_crop.png) of energy in the US comes from burning fossil fuels, that is what will be powering your car.  Unless of course you're plugged into a solar array, then you're truly driving zero emissions. 




 It is known. 




 Jon's brother, ammarite? 




 That's not really what plot armor is.  Especially not having huge amounts of "power".  Certainly didn't save Robert or Joffery.

I think it's more related to having your character have some kind of story arc that needs completion. 




 According to the wiki:
HBO announced Fortune as playing "Night's Watch Officer", but according to the actor and other sources this is the same role as Bowen Marsh in the books.

In the fourth season Fortune took over the role of Othell Yarwyck, which had been played by Dennis McKeever in the previous seasons. The reason for this sudden change has not yet been explained; or if the characters themselves have been merged.

 Maisie Williams is actually 17 and only a few months younger than Sophie Turner (Sansa), so she's not quite a little girl. 




 I was slightly confused by Ramsay's treatment of the Iron Islander.  What I inferred from the books is that they were actually fed and given safety.  Did the show deviate from the books by killing them all? 




 Not necessarily true.  At this rate the show is set to pass the books in terms of story.  I know GRRM layed out very broad strokes of what is supposed to happen, but they are not waiting for him.  We are going to have two parallel universes that may only converge at the ending.

 [This illustration](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Salladhor_Saan) in the wiki shows him as black, but I just searched the books and I don't think his skin color is ever mentioned. 




 Ah, yes, this definitely did not happen in the books, which is why I couldn't remember it. 




 What do you mean like Salladhor?

Wasn't he black in the books as well? 




 Why is Melisandre on there? When did she even meet her? 




 This one really was much better. The etching really helps bring out it's wolfiness.

 I can't get the brace to fit no matter what I do.  It seems like it's a few milimeters too long. Maybe the new alt is slightly different?  I'm thinking about taking off a little bit with a rotary tool.  What do you think? 




 Well. I've tried and tried and I cannot get the brace to go in.  If I put the front side in first, the back side doesn't fit, and vice versa.  I'm about to grind of a few milimeters from the end with a rotary tool.  Just want to make sure I'm not doing something stupid. 




 There's no audio system but this is an RV.  There are lights and things attached to the battery but I want to eventually move those to a second internal battery to be charged by solar panels. 




 Thanks. Do I have to attach the brace to the alt before I bolt it in or can I put the bolt through and then screw the brace on to the back of the Alt? 




 Ok, I had to cut off the connector on my old alt because it was melted into it and solder on a new one.  I have 3 issues left to finish this up!

1. I managed to get my shiny new alternator in, except for this piece (the 3rd image down).  It goes underneath the alt with the long bolt going through it and screws on to the back, I guess to give it more support.  This is probably a dumb question, but how important is this?  It was really hard to get it to go on properly.

2.  I think the belt is a little too loose because that gear below it does not spin when the belt is moving.  It seems almost impossible to get the belt tighter by swiveling the alternator.  Tips?

3. I also replaced the battery and when I went to connect it again there is this 3rd wire (that I'm holding in the picture).  I know this was connected to the negative terminal but I'm really not sure how.  Can I put it in with the other stranded wires? Oh yes, and it starts up fine without it connected, but I'm sure it should be.

OK, thanks for helping everyone.  Really looking forward to having this finished successfully. 









 When you want it NOW. 




 Kind of ruined it for me.  I found it much funnier when it was a couple of racist slurs interspersed with a bunch of random silly words. 




 I got the alt off and I'm working on those connections now.  [Picture](http://imgur.com/Lf1YPGm)  Which direction do I need to pull that plastic tab to remove it?  Towards the wires or up? 




 Ok. I was able to get all the bolts and belt off.  All that's left is to remove these electrical connectors.  This is the part I really don't want to screw up.  [Check out this pic](http://imgur.com/Lf1YPGm).
As you can see there are two connectors. Which direction do I need to pull the one with the plastic tab? Thanks for your help! 




 OK I put the info above.
I so wish I had a manual to follow.. 




 [Follow up post here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/25hxr8/need_help_removing_an_alternator_see_comments_for/) 




 OK.. So, in a previous post you guys helped me get the shroud off to get to the alternator. Awesome.

Now I'm struggling to get the alternator itself out.  I know I need to take that belt off, and I know I need to remove at least one electrical connector.  I completely removed the bolt that seemed like it would allow it to swivel, but it still won't budge.  The second bolt I can see is actually blocked by the belt itself.

Should I just try to stretch the belt enough to get a wrench to that second bolt?  Will it then swivel so I can loosen and remove the belt?

How about the electrical connector?  I'm not sure how to remove it and I don't want to damage it.

Thanks everyone!

 Thanks. I was able to get the shroud off! Woohoo. Now I can actually see the alternator.  Now I'm having trouble removing THAT of course.  I'll make another post...

FYI, I didn't have to remove anything, I just pushed the house hard enough that it got out of the way. 




 I need to remove the fan shroud to replace the alternator which has gone bad.  I unscrewed all the bolts from the fan shroud but I still can't get it out because of that thing in the way.  Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks!

Cigarette butts are the most common form of plastic litter on the beaches of the U.S. and world-wide. Toxic chemicals can leach out of the cigarette filters.


Cigarette filters may look like cotton, but are made of cellulose acetate, a plastic that is slow to degrade in the environment. Cigarette filters are specifically designed to accumulate particulate smoke components including toxic chemicals. 




 How long would it take Stannis to sail from Dragonstone to Bravos?  This is a deviation from the books and I'm wondering how it fits into the chronology. 




 Well.  I'll just see myself out.. 
























 I don't condone racism from from anyone.  Are the people posted about here racist? Yes.  Is that wrong? Yes. Does that cancel out other people's racism? No. 




 What are you talking about?  Are you implying that I hate people on this subreddit?  I'm an active participant in this subreddit and I want to see it be the best that it can be. 




 Respectfully disagree. 




  contrary examples are hard to find and they are

On this subreddit, yes. Not in the world.

  they are only human afterall

at least you concede that!

  but what with seemingly 9/10 jews claiming to be irreligious or atheist

Are you saying that being religious is necessary for being ethical? Because there are quite a lot of contrary examples of that as well.

Yes, it is complicated.  "Jews" means a lot of different things to different people.  Basically my point is, you can't pigeonhole people. If you go around assuming things about people and treating them based off of your ASSUMPTIONS about them, it's not only incredibly hurtful to people who don't deserve your scorn, but you are also missing out on some potential allies.

So you don't like racism right?  I'll leave you with the word's the late great MJ:
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
 




 Yes, it took me about 2 minutes of searching Google.  There are actually millions of stories of jews acting compassionately and peacefully.  I posted the wikipedia article to illustrate that it's actually something that's part of the religion.

Do you admit that you might have a slight confirmation bias when it comes to this? 




 I certainly don't have a geocentric view of the world.  Rather, the center is everywhere.  Also, the shift in my view wasn't based solely on scientific discovery, though it certainly played a part.  I think most importantly was the profound feelings of connection I felt that I couldn't easily rationalize away (and really I no longer have any desire to rationalize these things away).  I guess I really don't understand why some people try so hard to remove all sense of magic from the world.  Is that really the world you want to live in? 




 I don't think you are actually interested in seeing evidence contrary to your preexisting beliefs.  You are automatically downvoting my responses to the questions that YOU asked. 




 If you want to see the source, how hard is it to look at the references section?

 At the end of the day, there are many things that we don't KNOW.  So where do go from there?  We kind of fill in the blanks.  You can be agnostic about these things, and that's honorable, but sometimes entertaining a belief that you are not 100% sure of is not only harmless, but useful.  For instance, you might not be sure that you can run a marathon.  But you harbor this belief in yourself that you can, and this causes you to push yourself and train, and then lo and behold! you ran a marathon!  I think many things work this way.  Our thoughts actually create our reality.  I don't believe in objective truth and the process of belief to me is very much a creative one. 




 It absolutely led me to believe that my view of the world was too simplistic.  Part of that was realizing that a simple rejection of any notion of spirituality or connection to something larger than myself was too simplistic.  I accept that there is a whole lot that we don't know.  We will continue to learn more and more about the universe and our place in it.  I don't know if we will ever have a definitive answer to these really big questions, and for the moment I have to rely on what I *intuit* and what feels the best.  It seems to me like a lot of atheist are really uncomfortable with the idea of CHOOSING to believe something, but I think if they took a good look at their own thought process, they would realize they are doing the exact same thing. 




  There isn't actually any proof that our minds extend further than inside our physical brain. That's wishful thinking just like believing in God

There isn't any proof that they don't either.  So you CHOOSE to believe what you want just as I choose to believe what I want.  My world view happens to be more fun and useful for me personally. 




 Try mushrooms. In a comfortable setting (preferably outdoors), with people you trust, in a good head space, at a low dose.  




  Realistically, that probably won't happen, so my career plan at the moment for the future is to be a dietician.

I've got to stop you right there.  I was nodding my head through your entire post enthusiastically until I read this line.  You need to understand that you are the creator of your own destiny.  The cliche "whether you believe you can or can't, you're right" stands here.  Study and become a dietician if this makes you happy, it's a great thing to do, but never subjugate your dreams for something more "realistic".

  I am an ex-atheist. I know what atheism is, I was very proud to ascribe this label to myself between the ages of 13 til about 18. I didn't call myself agnostic, I was sure. I took a completely mechanical, deterministic view of the universe. Everything was simply an unfolding of chemical reactions since the Big Bang and in that universe, there is no room for free will, let alone "God".

So what changed? Well, for one, I found out that this is not actually the universe we live in. The world we live in far far stranger than that. There are not 4, but 10? or maybe an infinite number of dimensions. Time is not linear, but more illusory. Zooming down into the most base levels of existence, we find not mechanical reactions, but "vibrations". There is a universality of a force that composes all things. The world of the physical and mental are one.

Today, if I had to label my believe it would fall somewhere between pantheism an panentheism. The psychedelic experiences I've had, as well as dreams, have given me first hand experience that we are tapped into something much larger than ourselves. I don't believe in the Judeo-Christian deity. I do believe that what we normally experience is only a tiny fraction of Existence. To be alive and conscious is to be Divine. We are co creators and experiencers of our own magnificence.

Is anyone else here an "ex-atheist"?  To me it seems like a natural progression to go from believing in the God in the Bible, to disbelief, to pantheism. 




 This is the single funniest sign I've ever seen in my life.  I love thinking about the who designed this sign and how they managed to get it approved.  We need more sign designers/approvers like this! 




 Yup, you've got it.  They are not quite boids, much simpler I think, since they only respond to their closest neighbor.  Press the space bar to see who is neighbors with whom.

 What about systematically posting examples of people of a certain race behaving in unflattering ways and ignoring examples of the contrary? Is that racist?

 That's nuts man. 









 So.. generally, what's going on here? 




 Cool! I have to look into the flocking algorithm.  This looks funs.

 You guys are fucking retards.  In the world of adults, it's possible for a female to be friends with someone without banging them.  It's also common to have a social relationship with one's professor. 




 Taking them head on is basically out of the question. I think the solution lies more in doing everything we can to simply stop participating in their system.  Growing your own food and producing your own power is a good start. 




 There are so many ways to interpret this.  Can you post some examples of what you're complaining about? 




 So what's your solution? 




 Central valley farmers act like it's their god-given right to grow their monoculture crops there and would rather see all the rivers dry up then have to change their practices. 




 All we have to do is stop paying our taxes.  Collectively.  No tax income equals no way to pay the police and military. 




 I would love to know how many of the "conversations" about GMOs here on reddit are completely orchestrated.

 99th percentile means above 99% of the other test takers. 




 I don't get your kid's school. If there are 100 students in the school 1 of them is likely to be in the 99th percentile.  Was there something specific about your kid that made them skeptical?

 I picked this book up randomly in a bookstore when I was 14 when my sister was touring Humbolt U.  It literally changed the way I saw myself and the world and contributed very much to my philosophy.  That and mushrooms. Highly recommend both.

And this book [The Artist's Way](http://www.amazon.com/The-Artists-Way-Julia-Cameron/dp/1585421464) which is a workbook for tapping into your own creativity and to stop censoring yourself!

Your photography is your art!  Whatever medium comes natural to you, practice it everyday and hone it into a talent uniquely yours. 




 Actually it's about Israel.  I don't think the OP would care if a bunch of jews living in the United States formed a security company and won a contract. 




  You're arguing against a claim nobody here has made.

It sure seems like you are making that claim when you post a link to something that is clearly NOT about jews but about Israel and call it anti-semetic.

Like I said before, there are a few people on that sub who routinely turn criticism of Israel into anti-semtism. And I and others call them out on their racist bullshit.  But you are poisoning the well by pointing to the worst of the bunch and saying it is indicative of the majority.

 you know, like you're doing right now.

I'm not defending "thinly veiled antisemitism".  I'm defending the right of people to criticize Israel without being called racist (when they are actually not being racist).  It might seem like a tough distinction to make but it's really important to make that distinction. 




 Well, you are perpetuating the conflation.  I'm over there everyday trying to sort out the racist shit from the real criticism of Israel, calling people out.  What you are doing is just as bad and is playing into the confusion. 




 Yes, that sub is frequented by people who are genuinely anti-semitic and use criticism of Israel as a cover to voice their racist mentality. BUT that does not mean that everyone on that sub who is critical of Israel is anti-semitic.  What if I told you that there are jews who are critical of Israel? Does that blow your mind?  I know you probably don't care about this because your agenda is just to make people on that sub look bad, but I think you are being disingenuous when you conflate anti-zionism with anti-semitism.

EDIT: you could try replying to me before you hit that downvote button. 




 Where did I say I support the state of Israel?  You seem mentally incapable of separating criticism of Zionism with hatred of jews.  I'm done arguing with you because you're either a troll or very very lost. 




  A quote from a speech he gave in 1938:

 I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustainespecially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state. ... If external necessity should after all compel us to assume this burden, let us bear it with tact and patience.

Smart guy. 




 Yes. SEEEE, there are Jews who have been, do, and will continue to speak out against the injustices that go on in their name which has been HIJACKED by a dangerous elite. 




 The point had nothing do with the actual physiological reasons that sugar tastes good, as I'm sure you actually know.  The point is that not everything that tastes good is good for you, which was the original point icancatchbullets was trying to make. 




 It sounds to me like you're the one supporting genocide. YOU are the problem. 




  Plus, if superiority is a relative concept with no absolute definition, what's to stop people from forming different opinions on what "superiority" is?

Nothing, that's my point.  You really can use your own definition of "superior" if you insist on using that term at all.  Why not make your definition include some of the things you think are good? 




 ITT: racist fucks 




 Holy shit, I could find a thousand books written by white christians that have that exact same premise but with the group replaced.  When will you learn that the actions of an individual is not necessary indicative of that entire group.  You can cherry pick examples of assholes all you want, and you can come here to read more examples of what you already believe.  Do you know how fucking ridiculously fucked up your sort of rhetoric is?  How about treating all people with respect regardless of their race or religion?  Do you know how many Jews there are that are against Zionism and speak out about it?  I know it's real easy to spout out your racist nonsense behind the anonymity of a computer screen, but would you say these things in public? Why not?

/end rant 




 Sugar tastes fucking good because it triggers the same receptors as carbohydrates, which are nessesary for short-term survival.  This does not mean that our body knows that sugar is exactly what our body needs.  Your logic falls apart pretty fast. 




 How the heck do you figure that the ability to destroy one's own ecosystem is "superiority"?  As for "self-awareness" that is nearly impossible to define.

Try this on for size: superiority is a completely relative concept with no absolute definition.  It's just you saying "This is better than that" which translates to "I like this better than that."  Evolution does not give a shit about what you like better.  Complex does not equal better than simple.  The only metric of success you can use when talking about a lifeform is its ability to survive and proliferate, and by that metric, insects are surely doing better than we. 




 Please define "evolutionary superiority". 




 Holy shit, that sub is as bad as r/whiterights 




 So it's not possible for someone to engage in direct action and ALSO have a blog? 




  And how much is it to fly a head of lettuce across the continent, or a crate of bananas across the ocean?

Transporting anything is associated with carbon emissions, yes.  But that's not the point and that isn't what causes the huge emissions of meat consumption.  It is combination of methane output of cows and deforestation to make grazing land.

  and what of the carbon cost of the fertilizer that their manure replaces? 

[Manure only makes about 5% of fertilizer.](http://appliedmythology.blogspot.com/2013/03/no-cows-dont-make-fertilizer.html)  This is a non issue.

 My point is that you cannot just take one part of modern society and blame it for all of the ills of modern society. 

No one is claiming that meat consumption is to blame for ALL the ills of modern society.  Rather, it's about 14 and 22 percent of a very challenging problem. (Not to even mention the other compelling arguments for eating a plant-based diet.) If we want to solve it, we need to break it down and figure out what we can change.  Eating less meat is part of that. 




 That went from moving to powerful to jaw-dropping to eerily sobering. 




 Enjoy your prostate cancer. 




  The meat industry has contributed to climate change. Carnivorous diets haven't.

You do realize that industries don't magically emerge from nowhere and support themselves on air, right?  The strength of an industry is DIRECTLY related to consumer demand. 




 Edit: let me rephrase that.

You are right, air travel is an absolutely huge contributor to one's carbon footprint.

But Morrissey is right too.

[According to Scientific America](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-greenhouse-hamburger/):
The FAO report found that current production levels of meat contribute between 14 and 22 percent of the 36 billion tons of "CO2-equivalent" greenhouse gases the world produces every year. It turns out that producing half a pound of hamburger for someone's lunch a patty of meat the size of two decks of cards releases as much greenhouse gas into the atmosphere as driving a 3,000-pound car nearly 10 miles.

It's a fairly easy change to make with a huge impact, which is probably why he's touting it, but does it make up for the rest of the carbon emissions involved in his lifestyle? Probably not. 




 Yeah, actually [most cancer studies use those rats and the study was retracted due to pressure by Monsanto](http://truth-out.org/news/item/20516-in-depth-journal-retracts-independent-study-linking-monsanto-gmo-corn-to-cancer-in-rats).

 




 Health and safety are not the only reasons someone might want to avoid GMOs.  There are environmental effects for one, and someone might want to avoid purchasing GMO containing food because they simply don't want to support the companies profiting from it (perhaps because of the patent issue). People need to be informed in order to "vote with their dollars". 




 I get severe headaches EVERYTIME I eat food containing MSG, (even when I didn't know that it contained it before hand), so I am very grateful that it is labeled.  You cannot tell me it is completely harmless.  This is exactly why people need to be able to discern what is in the food they are eating.  You cannot make blanket statements about an organisms reaction to various chemical compounds (which is exactly what food is) and be right 100% of the time. 




 Damn, I'm sorry so many people aren't having any fun in life.  I'm an adult, I make games for a living, and I spend my copious free time hiking, swimming in rivers, playing music, and having sex with my polyamorous lovers.  This is the best my life has ever been. 









 Thanks!  You jolted me into realizing I need to get back to work!  My game is SOO close! 




 I'm travelling South America and I'm boarding a bus in Ecuador.  I have a plastic water bottle full of processed San Pedro cactus (which is a lot like Peyote, contains mescaline).  I also have some weed, which can also get you serious jail time in Ecuador.  As I'm waiting in line to board the bus, I notice a uniformed guard (perhaps a police officer?) searching people's bags before boarding.  I split off from my friend and walk around the corner where I down the San Pedro, not wanting it to go to waste, and put the weed in my sock under my foot....

Back at the bus, the guard is doing a really thorough job searching and it is taking quite a while.  By the time it is my turn I'm starting to feel the effects of the San Pedro kick in.  The guard asks me immediately to completely empty my bag.  I have a guitar, which he shakes, juggling balls, which he sniffs, and a little pipe which I've used to burn the herb that morning.  He examines the pipe for a long time, sniffing it, scraping tar with his finger, while my heart is pounding.  I mutter "para tobacco" as if that doesn't make me any more suspicious.  Finally he asks me to remove my shoes and it's all I can do to keep it together.  I step out of my my shoes and I'm now standing on top of the marijuana.  He shines a flashlight in my shoes and then finally, after what seemed like a half an hour search, tells me to get on the bus.

Needless to say, it was an interesting bus trip after that. 









 This is just not true.  There is a ton of research showing that sitting in excess is harmful to your health.

Here's a [summary of the research](http://www.juststand.org/tabid/816/default.aspx). 









 I just use a spreadsheet.  I use the following columns: 

* Type (Feature, Bug)
* Priority
* Milestone (I highly recommend using a milestone system
* Status (In Progress, Testing, Awaiting Assets, Complete, etc.)

I don't think the particular method of organization is important, just so long as you have a system which you use, makes sense to you, and use consistently. 




 Maybe I am learning this lesson now.. but is optimization really such a bad thing?  I think there is a probably a sweet spot in terms of how much effort you put into it.  Too much and you waste your time.  Too little and your game is inefficient and might not run on every device you want it to. 




 I like the music.

 I'm intrigued. What is this from? 




 I agree with your diagnosis of the problem, but when you make a post like this, can you please spend at least as much time proposing solution as you do illustrating the problem?  I realize this is a big departure from the the current culture of this subreddit, but without solutions and proposed actions there is absolutely no point to even illustrating the problem.  In fact, psychologically, we were better off before we knew, or when we weren't thinking about it.

I'll start: How can we stop war?  We can make war-mongering politically unfeasible by recalling/no longer electing anyone who supports war.  We can stop paying the portion of our taxes that goes to fund wars.  We can protest.  We can engage in anti-recruitment to ensure there aren't enough soldiers to engage in war. 




 You don't have to drink it.  There are great alternatives to milk and cheese that don't involved forcible-impregnation, a life of servitude, and early death. Just saying. 




 It took me a long time as a vegetarian to reluctantly accept that conclusion.  Then I discovered Daiya cheese and nutritional yeast!

 No, no, no.  If the owner of the property is not charged with any crime, there is no justification for seizure of property whatsoever.  Moreover, we need to end the failed war on drugs and start treating drug abuse like a health issue rather than a criminal one.

 Be proud of the American people and the spirit of innovation and self-sufficiency and self-determination that is the ideal of America.  Then fight like hell to save it from the plutocrats who have systemically destroyed our ideals in Orwellian fashion. 




 I'd say government has much more.  Religion has virtually no influence over my life.  One can chose to ignore it.  I can't simply ignore the governments demand that I pay taxes or abide by its myriad other laws. 




 Again, I didn't say you NEEDED religion to do that.  I already agreed with you on that point.  I just said, it can do that.

 meanwhile, everything bad you can do in the name of religion you actually need religion to do that

See my reply to your comment for my response to this argument.

It's been nice chatting. I'm going to bed now. 




 The same can be said of government. 




 I never said that.  It sometimes is. I also don't think it's universally a negative force in the world.  At it's worst it is brainwashing and violence-inducing.  At it's best, it brings people together with a knowledge that they can work together to improve the world.

Look, I'm not really a fan of organized religion.  I prefer a more fluid and personal path to spirituality.  I just don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. 




 The first statement, I absolutely agree with.  Religion does not have a monopoly on morality.

#2, depends on how you parse it.  For instance, would something like the Spanish Inquisition happen without religion? Not exactly like that, no.  But people can still be zealots without being religious.  Political zealots can engage is mass murder and persecution as well, like stalinists or anti-communists for example.

It's really not possible to distill all the world's problems down to a single thing.  Or if it is, it's something more fundamental than religion, maybe like ego, or fear. 




 People don't only identify on the basis of religion.  Other example of groups people identify with: ethnicity, nationality, class, idealogy. Come on man, use your head. 




 If people don't have religious beliefs, you're right, it's impossible to manipulate them on the basis of THOSE beliefs.  But my point is that religious beliefs are not the only way that capitalists manipulate people (particularly into war.)  They also use economic imperatives, non-religious ideology, and and just plain scaremongering.  I'll give you an example of each.

Economic imperative: "We need to go in and open up those trade routes!" or "Fight this war and you get money for college."

Non-religious ideology: "We've got to stop those commies or they'll destroy freedom everywhere!"

Fear: "Saddam Hussein. WMDs. 911. Saddam Hussein. WMDs. 911. Saddam Hussein. WMDs. 911." 




 That's not true.  There are tons of ways for capatalists to manipulate people.  They mostly do it through economic circumstances. They do it through debt, they do it though media manipulation, they do it through advertisement. I think you have a single track mind. 




 So if a Jew doesn't criticize Israel, they're a Zionist, but if they do, it's an example of "Jewish Privelage".  What would a jewish person have to do to avoid your criticism?

 




 You're right fundamentalism is a huge problem, but your last statement is hyperbole.  I think you're underestimating the influence that capitalists have over when and how often we go to war.  They often use religion as a tool to manipulate people however. 




 It doesn't matter which happens more.  They are both problems that feed off of each other. 




 There are many jews who don't support the oppressive policies of the state of Israel, and many who don't even think a "Jewish State" is a good idea.  A lot of jews are frankly pissed of that Zionist assume the right to speak for them.  This why you have to make this distinction. 




 Yes it would.  Judaism can be construed as a race or a religion.  If you are anti-any-race, you are a racist.  If you are criticizing the religion itself however, that is not racist.

 I bet your wife is cheating on you bro. 




 Great video series, thanks! 




 Finally I live somewhere where it's dark enough to actually see the Milky Way!  Between that and [this cool app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid hl=en) I'm learning the geography of our sky and it's exciting!  I'm looking for a telescope for under $200, either a good recommendation of one to buy or instructions on how to construct one (I know people do this.)  What are factors to consider when choosing a telescope beside magnification?  Thank you very much and I'm really looking forward to learning more and sharing with everyone here on /r/Astronomy 




 i was sitting thinking  
while the sky was sinking  
a cup of water by my side  
is this the water drinking me?  
(this is the water's cup)  
and is this rising water  
filling up with room?  
(this is the water's room)  
  

the sky still higher  
than the water's edge; i did not worry  
or hurry, took my time  
a rising tide, but time to [dredge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dredging)  
(this is the water's sky)  
i'm just floating bye  
or is this water breathing me?  
(these are the water's lungs) 




 Isn't this basically what shamans do? Focus on image of rain, the sound of rain, the feel of rain.  And here is rain! 




 I'm shocked. *shocked!* 




 You got me. 




 You are an American Hero! I don't think you are a traitor, but someone who cares deeply about his country!  Or should I say, "her country", however you want to identify is cool with me.  My question is, what needs to be done to safeguard whistle blowers from slander and prosecution? 




 You are an American Hero! What you did was brave.  You are not a traitor but someone who really cares about his country.  Or her country. However you want to identify. 




 I managed to fix my problem.  I had to recreate my Live USB and then I reinstalled.  I did two things wrong on my first attempt to install.  I didn't make a separate /home partition (I'm not sure if this is actually necessary but folks on the irc channel said I should.)  I think the main problem was that I selected sda1 as the boot disc instead of just sda.  After I reinstalled it booted directly into Mint.  After running "sudo os-prober" and "sudo update-grub" it now gives me GRUB on boot with both Mint and Windows present. Hurray! 




 This is long, but I'm trying to give all the necessarily details to get help.  Currently I can't boot either Windows or Linux.

I had a system with Windows 8 on one partition and Linux Mint on another and GRUB booting.  At some point Linux Mint became corrupt and I decided to wipe the partition and reinstall it. I chose to install Linux Mint KDE 64 bit edition.

So I created a Live USB and boot from that and did a manual disk partition.  I deleted the partition with Linux and created two new partitions in that space.  The first 3GB as a swap partition.  The remaining space became the a partition of type ext4 and mount point "/".  I think it's device id was /dev/sda5.  I selected sda1 to be the boot partition because I think this is where GRUB was location previously (it had a size of 500MB). sda2 is the Windows partition.  The installation went ahead and now when I boot I get this:

 Grub Loading. Welcome to Grub!
error: no such partition.
Entering rescue mode...
grub rescue

My first thought was to try to repair GRUB from linux so I put the bootable usb back and.  But now when i try to boot from the usb it gives this:

 MDM could not write a new authorization entry to disk. Possibly out of diskspace.   Error: no space left no device.

I press OK and it says:

 Could not start the X server (your graphical environment) due to some internal error...

It then goes to a black screen.  Next I will try making another bootable USB on my other computer since it apparently got messed up somehow.

I also tried messing around in the grub rescue prompt but I don't really know what I'm doing there.  How should I proceed? Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks! 




 In that case, we need to also focus on changing that law, which is fundamentally anti-democratic. 




 Let's start a campaign to recall her and every other senator that co-sponsored this bill.  If we threw them out of office every time they proposed some shit like this, eventually it would stop.  It would also be the beginning of citizens taking power back into their own hands.  

Democracy is government FOR the people BY the people, not the self-appointed elete. We DO NOT have to take it. 




 I love you guys. 




 We can get non-corrupt people in *positions of leadership* however.  Power corrupts, but leadership inspires. 




 We need to get our activism on, like now. 




 I will campaign for this.

 Of course it's speculation.  Since a causal link cannot be established by a correlation study we cannot rule out either explanation.

 Has anyone read, I Know Why the Caged Jackdaw is Not a Crow? 




 How many Californians does it take to screw in a light bulb?

We don't screw in light bulbs. We screw in hot tubs. ;-) 




 How long will it take to produce subsequent fruit? 




 Am I right to assume that it takes 3 years to START fruiting? But now that it has, it will produce new fruit much quicker than that?

 That or people who like to smoke are less likely to be violent.  Probably both. 




 It's funny how the ocean's ecosystem managed to thrive for millions of years without human intervention, but now it needs humans to step in and "protect it" in a way which is incidentally highly profitable. 




 Here's the thing. You said a "jackdaw is a crow."
Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying "crow family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.
So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people "call the black ones crows?" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.
It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know? 









 This is bullshit - you're oversimplifying a complex situation to the point of no longer adding anything to the discussion. 




 That's interesting.  I didn't consider the object bumping into air molecules in front of it and that it would bump into less with the wind blowing in the same direction.

Is there a formula for how much force is applied to the object by the wind based on the object's current velocity, mass, and the wind speed? 




 tie em to my belt loop.  oh well, it woulda been nice. 




 Found the vegan! 




 Somebody give this man gold! 




 I like what you wrote and I welcome you to the pantheist camp!  I just don't understand what Tyson said in the video that sounded pantheistic to you.  He said the universe is trying to kill us, which is a pretty silly idea to me. 




 Are saying that if I fire a cannonball at 50mph and there is a wind speed of 10mph in the same direction, it wouldn't travel any further than it would without wind? 




 That was a good read and I agree with him mostly.  I take issue with the idea that theories which are not falsifiable don't deserve to taken seriously.  Non-falsifiable theories are simply outside the realm of science, but this doesn't make them ridiculous.

 Wow, same also.  A trend emerges... 




 Exactly how was that talking like a pantheist?

 I'm on the verge of ordering an Extreme Q and I just had the idea to fill up some balloons and take them hiking. Has anyone tried this? How long can the vapor stay active in there? Thanks budddiees. 




 Drugs, drugs are bad, mmmmk? 




 All he'll get there is name calling and willful ignorance. 




 A lot of why marijuana is illegal in the first place is because of the risk industrial hemp posed to the oil industry. So they had to demonize/criminalize the whole thing.  Time to change things. 




 Bonding over weed is great.  I remember when I discovered my Dad toked.  It totally improved our relationship. 




 Everything does.  Milk is actually gnarly.  Try hemp milk! Goooood. 




  The majority of adoptable dogs are never brought through our doors (we refer them to local adoption groups and walk-in animal shelters). Most of the animals we house, rescue, find homes for, or put out of their misery come from miserable conditions, which often lead to successful prosecution and the banning of animal abusers from ever owning or abusing animals again. 




 As a two year old child, can confirm. 




 Why do I have you tagged as "Begin Karma Train here"?

  I identify as both egalitarian and MRA. They are not exclusive.

Neither is feminists and egalitarian! Double standard much?  

 Yeah it does and I'll tell you why. Tell a feminist you're pro-male and they will assume you're anti-female and a woman hater/beater/rapist.

Do you not see the irony in this?  You are assuming that anyone is who feminist is anti-male.  I just can't even.. 




 Thanks! They actually wrap around the edges. 









 Can someone explain what's wrong here? I'm really new to archery. 




 I never said it was.  But it's important to remember the situational forces at work here.  Yes, at the end of the day, everyone is personally accountable for their own actions. 




 Pro-feminist does not mean anti-male. And both assertions are far from the reality. 




 [Interesting Read](http://www.john-lennon.com/whokilled.htm) 




 This is probably true.  And that's because colonialists made it impossible for them to live the tribal lifestyle they've lived for thousands of years through taking of land by force and exploiting the natural resources.  Now the animals suffer. 




  something that a certain race does.

This the the problem.  **A certain race does not collectively do anything.**  Individuals do things.  When you make collective judgements about people, this is prejudice. 




 You'll never be "right" in absolution.  Isn't it great how science always seems to reveal more questions, just when we think we're on the verge of answers? 




 Firstly, I'm glad you experience the magic of the universe. 

 How would my world be any more magical if I believed a talking bush told me to commit war crimes?

This is a total strawman.

 But I think what really sets us apart is the red pill/blue pill question: could it be that you prefer to hold wrong beliefs that are comforting rather than true beliefs that are not.

What really sets us apart is that you believe in an objective reality and I believe it is more subjective.  That ultimately comes down to a philosophical debate, because it is impossible to prove the nature of the universe to be either way.  But take a look at special relativity for an example of how reality might be different for different observers.
