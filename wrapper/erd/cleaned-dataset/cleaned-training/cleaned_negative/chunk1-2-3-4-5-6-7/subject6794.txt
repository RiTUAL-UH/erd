 Well..... welcome to reddit i guess. 









 Zoids. It was a really underrated show on cartoon network and a lot of people I know have never even heard of it. Probably because it was on at like 5:30 in the morning. Maybe it could get some sort of following after being on Netflix.  
























 The same goes with video games? Do you play them in chronological order or when they were made? Example:Kingdom Hearts or Metroid?  




 For example Star Wars. Do you watch New hope, Empire, Return and then the prequels? Or prequels first?  




 One of my favorites is "graffiti is for fags"

 Driving in San Francisco is HORRIBLE! There are one way streets everywhere. If you miss your turn or your entrance to the grocery store, you have to go up two more blocks, turn left, get on the highway, merge to a different Highway, take the exit, and left turn, just to get to the turn that was 3 feet behind you. Not to mention... It's all uphill  
























 There's actually a mod to THUG2 called THUGPRO that's takes all the levels from thug1 and 2, thps4, thaw, and more. The community is growing. Check it out! Just Google it.

 I remember Create-a-review. That's was the place for the community! I remember hanging out with the Tho guys. Tek was really cool.  




 Just some beautiful animation there. I love how Quagmire just stands there stone faced, unblinking. There's so much liveliness in the characters, especially if you remove Peters mouth. Walt Disney would be proud.
