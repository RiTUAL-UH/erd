 Hi Reddit,

My boyfriend has been taking Citalopram (celexa) for his depression for a month now but he has admitted that he has no desire to have sex. I asked if I could make him want to and he said 'please don't do that', I asked if he thought we would any time soon and he said he didn't know.

I was wondering if anyone with experience of this could give me some advice on what to do?
We have been together three years so it's not the end of the relationship if we don't have sex for a while, but I already really miss feeling intimate with him like that, and it's upsetting me thinking we might not get that back any time in the foreseeable future. Especially as we're so young. 
Every time anyone mentions sex I get sad. 
He won't want to change his medication as it seems to be working for him so far, and at the moment I don't think sex is very important to him at the moment. 

I would really like some help with how to handle this, what I can do, and how over people have handled a relationship without sex?

 He's only on 20mg so not a very high dose...  
























 I suppose in the future it might be a possible for him to do that, but at the moment I think he's probably better on a slightly higher dose.
I'll mention it to him at some point as an option.. Thankyou! 
























 He was diagnosed 1 month ago and given anti-depressants after feeling low for a few months (which has been happening now and then for four years but he has never been to the doctors).
When he was diagnosed he told me he needed space to sort his head out and for me to not talk to him for a few weeks, no-contact.

I obliged and after 1 week he said he didn't like the thought of me being upset and it was all he could focus on so we decided to start texting again and he came and saw me, but he said he didn't know if he wanted to see me again for a while. 

I then saw him that weekend for about two hours, and have seen him once a week since then usually for a night and a few hours the next day. He actually seems completely normal and happy when I have seen him which is nice.

I am not seeing him throughout the week, and he has not come round to see my family I have gone to see his.
He has forgotten our anniversary and I gave him a card but he didn't get me one or offer to pay for the dinner (something he would usually offer on our anniversary)

I feel constantly on edge and nervous he's going to stop speaking to me or going to decide he can't see me. I think I'm having a hard time thinking that the depression has caused the way he has been acting because when I see him he is normal and excited about his job and just not different.

We haven't had sex for about 7 weeks because of the depression and now the anti-depressants have taken away his sex-drive. When we do see eachother we cuddle and it's nice but it's not the same intimacy.

I am really struggling with knowing what to do, I miss him and feel so lonely even though he is in my life and I have have such high anxiety levels at the minute. 

This all may sound selfish but it's just hit me how down I have been for the last month doing everything on his terms and praying he feels better and wants me in his life. 
























 Thankyou so much for your message. I want to stay with him, we have been together for three years and I want to be there for him. But it's confusing me when he acts happy and seems perfectly OK and himself, and then treats me poorly (forgetting our anniversary, not being there for me through things, not seeing me often). I am associating his bad behaviour with what he is going through, but then he doesn't seem any different and I'm finding it difficult. 
























 Thankyou so much, that means a lot. I just need to stop feeling sorry for myself and feeling like I've pulled the short straw when I see other people in happy relationships going on holidays (which we had plans for and have had to ignore) and days out. I would be more miserable without him though, he's my bestfriend.
I'm going to try and ride the storm and be supportive and just be there until I I can't do it anymore and hopefully it'll get better.
Thanks again for your help and your words.
