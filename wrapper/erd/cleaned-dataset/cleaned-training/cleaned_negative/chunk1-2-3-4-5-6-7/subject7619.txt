 Here's a pro-Christian story for you. I drained our bank account today to do laundry and go grocery shopping. I was thirty-something dollars short at the register and the nice, old, Christian couple behind me said that Jesus implores them to help me and my daughter. I thanked them about a hundred times and all they said was "bless you" in return. Some of my faith in humanity has been restored :-)

I'm an atheist and I have been most of my life, and believe me, I know all about the evils of religion and the harm it's caused throughout history and today, but we have to be willing to give credit where credit is due. 

Yes, I know it would've been better if they'd done it out of their own personal goodness instead of what Jesus would have them do, but regardless, it was a nice thing to do, and I am grateful.

TL;DR - Christian couple pays the balance for my groceries and I, as an atheist, am delighted.

Dear Christopher,

 

Knowing your concern regarding the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), I wanted to take this opportunity to update you on my position regarding this legislation.  I have appreciated having the benefit of your thoughts on this important issue.

 

H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act was introduced by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) on October 26, 2011.  It has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee. The primary purpose of SOPA is to stop the theft of intellectual property from foreign-based websites. 

 

Although well intentioned, many have raised legitimate concerns regarding the legislation and believe the manner in which SOPA attempts to achieve its goals of stopping the theft of intellectual property from foreign-based websites is unworkable and includes many unintended and dangerous consequences. I am writing today to inform you that I have severe reservations with the legislation in its current form.

One of the main issues regarding SOPA, is it would force Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block access to websites that have been accused of facilitating copyright infringement.  Blocking access will likely slow down internet connectivity, while eroding the necessary trust the system needs. It would also set a dangerous precedent of allowing our government  and others  to filter domains. Fortunately, all sides have signaled this provision should be dropped.

Furthermore, the legislation would place a tremendous legal burden on websites accused of third-party copyright infringement and would cause them to be removed from search engines.  Even if they made an honest mistake, they would be faced with litigation from the U.S. Attorney General. Fighting the accusations would cost an enormous amount of time and money, and smaller sites would likely go out of business. Private lawsuits could also be brought against the websites. This would open up the potential for massive lawsuit abuse  even though the vast majority of online piracy occurs through a small number of websites.

While the federal government does have a role in protecting intellectual property rights, it should do so in a way that does not weaken internet security, disrupt growth, or restrict free speech and your First Amendment rights. 

As the debate on this legislation continues, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to ensure the needs of copyright protection are balanced with the First Amendment Rights of all Americans. Currently H.R. 3261 remains in the House Judiciary Committee. While I do not serve on this committee, rest assured I will keep your concerns in mind should this legislation, or a similar bill ever come to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote.  

 

It is an honor to represent you in Congress.  Your suggestions are always welcome.  Please feel free to contact either my Washington office at (202) 225-5456 or the district office, (603) 641-9536.  Also visit my website at www.guinta.house.gov  for information on legislative issues and follow me on Facebook at facebook.com/repfrankguinta  and Twitter at @RepFrankGuinta.

 My email to Representative Peter G. Palumbo: 

You called a teenage girl an "evil little thing" because she's an atheist and got religion out of a public school where it doesn't belong? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Actually, you ought to be dragged out of office. You know what I consider evil? A full grown adult male in a position of power publicly shaming a child who bravely challenged the system and won. You are a coward.

 Furthermore, how was it ever seen as a good idea to just take someone country, divide it, displace its people, and give it away to someone else? If the UN just suddenly decided that it was going to create a (insert ethnic or religious people) state by dividing the US into West and East halves and give the Western United States away, wouldn't it pretty well expected that Americans, especially the displaced ones from the West, would get pissed? I can't wrap my head around how this ever seemed like a good idea to anyone ever. 




 It seems to me his rabble rousing "Long Telegram" instigated the whole thing.

 The violence of this play is actually so over-the-top, all I could think of is old "B" horror movies.

We have war, ritual butchery and sacrifice, crime of passion, premeditated murder, rape (gang rape at that), mutilation, execution, self-mutilation, cold-blooded senseless murder, torture, the threat of infanticide, cannibalism, honor-killing, child murder, consensual homicide, and if you believe Titus knew he wasnt going to live through it himself, you can call it suicide in there as well.  And layers upon layers of revenge. 














 First off, let's get the disclaimer out of the way: I am **NOT** a racist. At all. I recently moved to San Antonio from New Hampshire to be closer to my family, which, by the way, includes quite a few Mexican-Americans. 

I have a 3-year-old daughter who is white with gray eyes and blond hair. Recently, my wife told me coworkers of hers, including Mexican-American women, warned her after meeting our daughter that blond-haired/blue-eyed white girls get picked on by the girls of Mexican descent. 

Is this true? If so, why is it true? My wife didn't want to push the issue with her coworkers at the risk of offending them, but I'm worried for my daughter, who will be entering into pre-K next year. I doubt it's a problem with 4-year-olds, but I don't want her to grow up being bullied, either.

I have no problem with Mexican-Americans or Mexicans in general. In fact, one of the things I love about San Antonio is the Mexican culture, art, and food. 

Another thing that I've noticed is my daughter, being very outgoing and friendly, tends to walk onto playgrounds waving, smiling, and shouting things like, "Hi, friends! My name is _______! Want to play?" and the looks she gets from some of the kids are like... I don't know... mean. Like, "Who is the kid? Why is she saying hi to me? Why is she calling me a friend?" This got her instant playmates in NH. Here, it gets her dirty looks. Cultural thing? Again, this is the Latino/Latina children. The white, black, and Asian kids have been pretty warm to her.

Sorry if this is a TL;DR, but I don't know how to shorten it and I'm very curious.

**EDIT**: I'd be especially interested in hearing from Mexicans, especially those who grew up in San Antonio.

For those downvoting, I don't get you. This is an honest question out of concern for my daughter. It's not an attack on anybody. 














 A Monologue is a speech that is spoken to someone else, or at least another character on the stage hears it.

A Soliloquy, is a speech spoken to nobody, and only the audience hears it, not any other character in the play. 

So which is this? 

When Shakespeare writes dialog, they say what they mean. If hes talking about Love, hes in love. If hes talking about killing someone, hes angry and really wants to kill them. It is, for the most part, difficult to lie in Shakespearean speech, without a stage direction saying, He or She is lying. There are exceptions, but they just have to be supported by the text. The things other people say, or what that character says before or after the incident in question. In other words, they do say what they mean, unless there is evidence to support otherwise.

What is it even saying anyway?

To be, or not to be... 

Be as in existing. To exist or not to exist, to live or not to live. Okay, hes openly questioning if he should live or die. So, this speech is about whether or not Hamlet should kill himself, which isnt totally out of the blue; at the beginning of the play, the first time Hamlet is onstage alone, he contemplates it there as well.

Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer

The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,

Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

And, by opposing, end them.

Which is better? Just take my wealth and position, keeping my mouth shut, but be racked with guilt over it, or to actually stand up for what I believe in, even though it would destroy and kill me and my family?

To die, to sleep-

No more, and by a sleep to say we end

The heartache and the thousand natural shocks

That flesh is heir to  tis a consummation

Devoutly to be wished.

But if Im dead, no more pain, no more suffering, no more guilt, and all the problems I have now just go away. Hey, that sounds pretty good...

To die, to sleep.

To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, theres the rub,

For in that sleep of death what dreams may come

When we have shuffled off this mortal coil

Must give us pause. Theres the respect

That makes calamnity of so long life...

And if its all just a long sleep, whats on that other side? Its supposed to be so wonderful; thats why we endure all the crap in this world.

It goes on, but we can see its basically a suicide note of sorts, or at least a contemplation on the part of Hamlet.

Just before Hamlet comes on stage to give this speech, Claudius and Polonius, the murderous King and his Crony are talking with Ophelia, Polonius daughter, and Queen Gertrude. The Queen leaves... okay, now 3 on the stage. Polonius
then says:

Ophelia, walk you here.  Gracious, so please you,

We will bestow ourselves.

Hes telling Ophelia, Hamlets Girlfriend, to hang out here. But we will bestow ourselves.? 

The archaic meaning of bestow is to stow, deposit, store. So... lets store ourselves? Lets stow ourselves? Yes! Theyre saying, Lets go hide, which they then do. They exit, and Hamlet enters, talking all morbid.

But Ophelia is still on-stage. There is no Ophelia exits, nor is there Ophelia re-enters, so shes there the whole time while Hamlet talks about killing himself.

So, is the speech an aside that no one else hears? No, because at least one other person hears it, if not three. Hamlet finishes, then sees Ophelia, they have a big argument, and he gets crazy with the nunnery bit.

Exit Hamlet; enter back in Claudius and Polonius, talking about how mad Hamlet seemed because they absolutely heard him and Hamlet knew this. Then Polonius says:

How now, Ophelia?

You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;

We heard it all.

So, they did hear it! 

In most all the previous scenes, and the ones after, Hamlet is very active; hes planning, plotting, getting things ready; hes already made some written contributions for the Theatre troupe thats preparing to perform for the Royal Court. Hes been pushing his plans forward to trap the King and give the final proof he needs to show that the King did in fact kill his father. Since seeing the ghost of his dead dad, hes been consumed by this desire for justice and revenge. Suddenly, for this 1 scene, he does a complete 180 degrees and finds it a good idea to kill himself? Yes, he contemplated it in the beginning, but keep in mind, that was BEFORE he found out his father was murdered. He didn't have any motivations as he does now. At that time, it was thought to be natural causes and the will of God, and hence, theres no one to get mad at, because no one did anything wrong. When the issue of murder comes up, that changes everything and revenge becomes his motive.

Suicide is a non-solution. Its a passive thing to do compared to the rest of the events going on. Its the easy way out, and Hamlet has been setting up these plots and plays with Machiavellian precision, which is definitely not the easy way to do anything. One could claim this speech shows another side to the character of Hamlet, but would that do anything to move the story forward? On its own, it doesnt. The full text of this play can run upwards of 4 hours long. How many people will sit for a 4 hour movie when it has parts that go nowhere? Is this speech Shakespeares way of saying, Heres a bathroom break?

NO! It is NOT a soliloquy! Ophelia was on-stage. Claudius and Polonius are hiding, and listening in, and Hamlet knows it! That means his whole suicide speech is by design. Hes already spent a few scenes convincing people that hes gone mad, and there IS method in it. The King and crony are trying to figure out if its true. Now, hes actively deceiving them, so that would make this speech something that moves the plot forward. Its just another part of Hamlets master
plan, and so far, theyre falling right into it.

More evidence: The last time we saw Hamlet on stage, he meets The Players, and asks the head player to give a short, impromptu performance, who readily obliges him. Then, everyone else ends up leaving the stage, leaving Hamlet, alone, for real this time. Here he has a real soliloquy (he even mentions hes all alone) whereupon he marvels at the performance that head player just gave. In fact, he realizes, and is very much ashamed at the fact, that the actor has just
shown more intensity and commitment in his task of that brief performance than Hamlet has in HIS task of avenging his fathers murder. Hamlet has just mentally smacked himself, reminding him to start raising the stakes, or hes going to fail at his task, and also realized the importance of acting as a role in his deceptions.

So I'm supposed to believe that suddenly, the very next words he speaks on stage are implying the direct opposite? That he wants to kill himself? A soliloquy of his innermost thoughts that says he needs to step it up followed by another saying the complete opposite? 

Even MORE evidence: Shakespeares original source for Hamlet. This is NOT an original play by Shakespeare. It had been done previously by other playwrights and writers. The original source is called Historia Danica by Saxo Grammaticus. It chronicles the story of Prince Amlothi, also referred to as Amlethus. Pull off the u-s at the end, move the "H" to the front, and you have "Hamlet." The plot matches the play exactly. The father of Amlethus is murdered by his brother who then marries Amlethus mother, the Prince seeks revenge. A large part of his plan has to do with feigning madness. Two attempts are made to prove hes actually sane, one of which is to tempt him into lechery, the thinking being that any man who lusts for women cannot truly be insane. His uncle arranges for a woman to casually run into Amlethus in the forest to seduce him while they watch, which is the prototype scene for this Hamlet/Ophelia scene. But Amlethus is warned of the trap ahead of time, so he makes his own arrangements to whisk her off to a hidden place away from the eyes of the Kings agents, who gets her to tell him everything. He also has sex with her, because why wouldn't he? But in the view of the Kings agents, he continues his act of being batshit insane.

"To Be or Not To Be" is not a soliloquy; it is a monologue!

 Every history teacher I've ever had always explained the importance of history as a means to learn from our past. Do we, though? Seems like we always have the same problems in government, wars, laws, civil rights, etc. For example, miscegenation used to be argued against the same way same-sex marriage is now. We said there'd never be another Vietnam, going into a foreign country, fighting non-soldiers without uniforms without an exit strategy, but we did. Do we really learn from our past? 



















 I just did a clean install of Maya (Mint 13 w/Cinnamon). My PS3 Eye, which I had been using as a webcam/microphone for Skype purposes, was plugged in when I booted up the first time, and the camera was detected and works perfectly. The problem is, the microphone doesn't pick up. Can't Skype without a microphone. Any ideas?

**UPDATE**: I found [this forum](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1785840) which had the following advice which worked for someone:

To /usr/share/alsa/init/00main in the section that is '# real ALSA configuration database'

Unfortunately, being a noob, I have no idea what to do with that information. 









 **EDIT**: Linux Mint w/Cinnamon (they couldn't come up with a gayer name?) is fully installed and working perfectly. Thank you so much to both AziMandia and PyroNavi for all the help. Goodbye Microsoft!

 I think the greatest social experiment ever would be to divide the US into two allied-but-separate nations. 

One would be The United Conservative Republican States of America (USRSA). 

The other would be The United Liberal Democrat States of America (ULDSA). 

We'd still be cool and everything, totally best buds, but governed separately.

Let's see who's doing better in 50 years.

**UCRSA:**

* Abortion is outlawed with a possible exception for rape and incest in some of their 25 states (states' rights). 

* All or most gun laws are lifted, varying by state. 

* School prayer takes place immediately before the required pledge of allegiance, although children may opt-out. 

* The 10 Commandments can be listed in court houses, public schools, and other Christian references are allowed in generally public squares. 

* Hostility toward non-Christian faiths, and especially secularism may cause a mass exodus of non-Christians. 

* Same-sex marriage is outlawed with marriage defined in the constitution as one-man/one-woman. Some states may opt to allow for civil unions.

* Strict laws are passed to prevent illegal immigration with employers of undocumented workers fined or jailed. 

* Illegal immigrants are exported. 

* Even with 25 states, the UCRSA still outspends every other country on defense, continues war on terror. Efforts on homeland security are maintained or expanded.

* Tax breaks persist for the wealthiest Americans while social programs to benefit the poor are drastically defunded or cut altogether. Welfare is dramatically overhauled. 

* The death penalty is subject to state law, with most states requiring capital punishment for at least some offenses. 

* Drugs laws vary by state in terms of penal severity, but marijuana remains federally outlawed. 

* Free market economy is minimally-regulated with corporate tax incentives. American corporations may therefore choose to be headquartered in the UCRSA over the ULDSA.

* The energy economy emphases oil, natural gas, and coal with expanded off-shore drilling, pipelines, and fracking. Environmental regulations are relaxed.

* OSHA compliance becomes optional. OSHA-certified companies may advertise their jobs as such.

* Minimum wage varies by state and is not mandated.

 ______________________________________


**ULDSA:** 

* Abortion varies by states, but is legal to some extent everywhere. 

* Guns are heavily regulated, but some form of a firearm is legal in all 25 states, albeit with conditions. Licenses are granted for either hunting, protection, or both. In either case, gun-owners are registered with their firearms, all sales are tracked including ammunition and accessories, and licenses require criminal and mental health background checks. All gun sales and purchases must be carried out by licensed gun-retailers: no gun shows, no private sales. Guns, ammunition, magazines, and accessories are limited and regulated.

* Separation of church   state is explicit in the constitution with the ULDSA officially declared legally secular. Religions may operate freely, but fall under all normal laws and are subject to equal taxation. 

* Taxes are based proportionately on wealth with those most able to pay subject to higher taxes; those least able to pay are subject to less or no taxes. 

* Marriages between any consenting adults are recognized with all relevant benefits. 

* Equal rights are afforded to any and all Americans, regardless of race, gender, sexuality, religion, etc. "Affirmative action" varies according to state laws.

* Native Americans are offered an entire state with a sincere apology and an offer to declare independence as a sovereignty or remain a territory of the ULDSA with all relevant protections and rights under assumption of recognition of applicable federate laws and mandates.

* The ULDSA largely stays out of foreign affairs and redirects previous defense funds toward education, infrastructure, social programs, a replacement program for NASA, scientific research, and single-payer "socialized" health care.

* Health care falls under government regulation with taxes and subsidies encouraging healthier lifestyle choices. 

* Death penalty abolished with the highest form of punishment being "life without possibility of parole." Greater emphasis on rehabilitation. 

* Drug offenders with no violent criminal history are released. Criminal records of drug offenses are kept for reference only. 

* Marijuana legalized and regulated. 

* Fossil fuels are reduced with greater emphasis on renewable energy sources and limited nuclear. 





Where would you rather live? Be honest.

 Got word he shipped and a tracking number in less than 24 hours. No FE asked for. Four days later, the product is in my hand and vacuum sealed. I'll come back to review the actual product, but when it's advertised as "regular commercial" and at this price, you can't be too disappointed. DrWhite is ultra A+. Will do business again. HIGHLY recommended.

 I know this has been asked before, but it's been a while, and this isn't just about "saddest." Was it shocking? Did it make you angry? Were you glad? Do you ever want them to come back? If they have come back, are you happy or mad? 




 I'm trying to choose a subject for my Anthropology final :) 

My paper will be on applied anthropology, but I need to narrow it down as anthropology is apparently applied to nearly everything! 












































 Thinking of enrolling my 3-year-old daughter in a gymnastics class. Based on online research alone, I'm leading toward this place: http://www.gymnasticsofsanantonio.com/programs

Anyone have experiences with any place in SA they'd like to share? 


































 I want to get my wife gift certificates for a quality massage and a pedicure. It doesn't have to be the same place, but we're new in town (from New England), and she doesn't have a regular place for either one anymore. We're in the Ingram Park area just south of Leon Valley, but anywhere an hour drive or less would be fine. Thank you! 












































 DAE think "quantity" and "price" should be added to the sort options? Popularity and seller ratings are all well and good, but it's annoying to try and find pounds in a sea of grams, or trying to find the pricier bulk stuff out of over a thousand options. 




 For example, Marvel gets Batman and DC gets Spider-Man. 




 My pick? It may surprise you. Not Superman. Not Batman. Wonder Woman. Marvel already has a rich mythology with Thor, Hercules, etc., and related characters, and the Wonder Woman mythology would blend nicely. Besides, how many comics does Marvel have starring a solo woman?

Who would I trade to get her? Well, Wonder Woman is one of DC's "Big Three," or "Trinity," so it's going to take a sizable trade. I'd offer Daredevil, Elektra, Bullseye, Moon Knight, Power Man, Iron Fist, Ghost Rider, and The Fantastic Four. 




 My pick? Spider-Man. He'd be a shoe-in for The Justice League, and he brings a unique style and power-set to the DC universe. 

Who would I be willing to trade to get him? I'd like to see what Marvel could do with some 2nd stringers like Booster Gold   Blue Beetle (Kord), but they'd probably need more in exchange for a heavy-hitter like Spider-Man. Throw in Lady Godiva, Fire, Ice, Power Girl, Captain Atom, Firestorm, Red Tornado and Hawkman if that's what it takes. If that's still not enough, throw in Captain Marvel. How could they resist?

 Your body's name must be Visa, because it's everywhere I want to be... 






















































 My picks:

Justice League: International - It was just getting good when they canceled it.

Shadow Cabinet: An old Milestone series featuring Icon, Rocket, Donner, Blitzen, Iron Butterfly, Mechanic, Payback, Starlight, Twilight, etc.

Cyborg: I think it's pretty messed up he was promoted to be a core and founding member of the Justice League and doesn't have his own book.

Black Lightning: Very cool superhero who doesn't get the exposure he deserves.

Ragman: He looks cool and there just aren't a lot of Jewish superheroes. He could even join Batman Inc. and be the sanctioned hero of Israel or something.

The Creeper: An entertaining character who, in the hands of the right writer, can be a great read.

Lobo: Yeah, this character reeks of the 90s, but he's kind of like DC's answer to Wolverine.

Hitman: One of the best comics DC has ever published.

The Atom: The on-again, off-again Leaguer has some interesting adventures.

New Gods: It's kind of a classic, and Orion and Darkseid have already made appearances.
 














 It could be artists or writers, but who's someone who gets a lot of fanfare you just can't stand, and why?

Personally, for writers, I have to say Frank Miller. While I loved everything he did up until 300, everything since has been awful.

For artists, ~~Scott Lobdell~~ Kenneth Rocafort, mainly for that [stupid pentagon](http://insidepulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-21-at-8.54.15-PM-500x319.png) he obsessively draws on every nose.

**EDIT**: I want to add J. Michael Straczynski to writers. In terms of Spider-Man's worst enemies, Doc Ock and Green Goblin have nothing on JMS. 




















































































 Cowardice asks the question, "Is it safe?" Expediency asks the question, "Is it politic?" Vanity asks the question, "Is it popular?" But, conscience asks the question, "Is it right?" And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one must take it because one's conscience tells one that it is right. ~ Martin Luther King Jr.

 If I were fortunate enough to be given the reigns to direct my own Batman franchise, the first entire trilogy would be focused on The Joker.

 

Batman: Year One - Gotham is established as crime-ridden city. We get Bruce Wayne's origin story and the rise of two warring crime syndicates: The Zucco Family and The Falcone Family. When Bruce returns, he begins his crusade as Batman and aids Lieutenant Gordon and DA Harvey Dent in bringing down the mobs, the most prominent of which is The Falcone Crime Family, which has their dirty work done by the mysterious Red Hood.

 

Meanwhile, Bruce and Alfred attend a circus only to see two performers, The Flying Greysons, fall to their deaths with their acrobat teenage son left behind. Knowing what it's like to be orphaned, Bruce offers to take their 16-year-old son, Dick Greyson, as his ward. Batman vows to seek out the guilty party. It seems there's more to Haley's Circus than meets the eye, with ties to the Zucco mob and possibly more. Batman temporarily switches his focus to the Zucco Family, much to this dismay of Gordon, who wants the pressure to stay on The Falcones. Tony Zucco, the man responsible for the death of Greyson's parents, nearly gets the drop on Batman but is stopped by Dick, who shows up unexpectedly, having figured out Batman's identity after finding the secret entrance to the Bat Cave. Dick wants to kill Tony, but Batman stops him.

 

After some drama over getting involved, Batman leaves Dick with Alfred to discuss it later, now ready to go after the Falcones full-throttle. In the end, after a battle with Batman in a factory, Hood takes the plunge into the chemical vat. Batman thanks Gordon and the DA, leaving a gift on roof of the GCPD: The Bat Signal.

 

Batman: Year 2 - Lieutenant Gordon is now a Police Captain and facing an uphill battle surrounded by crooked cops and a Commissioner and mayor who are anti-Batman. Unfortunately, a new menace has risen in the form of the psychopathic Joker, who has gone to war with organized crime, with the remainder of The Zucco Crime Family having risen to go to war with the struggling Falcone Crime Family. The Joker has created pure chaos, creating problems for criminals, the justice system, and citizens alike. All of this is to get Batman's attention, with whom he seems to have some sort of vendetta.

 

Dick, meanwhile, is being put through intensive training as he continues to insist on involving himself in Batman's affairs. Batman is trying to physically and mentally break him to prove he's not cut out for it, but Dick is surpassing every expectation. In some respects, he's even a better student than Bruce was. Still, Batman warns about him getting involved.

 

Batman's hand is forced, however, when The Joker stages an assault on Wayne Manor as part of his war on the wealthy and powerful. Alfred is safe in the Bat Cave, but Dick is kidnapped, as The Joker is curious what Bruce Wayne would do for the boy's life. Alarms and camera footage alert Alfred, who communicates the kidnapping to Batman. Now it's personal.

 

Batman confronts The Joker, barely rescuing Dick before an explosion. When Batman orders Dick to stay put while he pursues Joker, but he doesn't listen. During an encounter, The Joker explains that Batman created him, causing Batman to feel guilt for all of The Joker's crimes. The whole ruse was a trap for Batman, getting Batman between the cross-hairs of the warring Zucco and Falcone families. While Batman deals with them, The Joker would be getting away, but he's stopped by Dick, who is crudely disguised with some scraps of green and red clothing he found in the alley. While Dick is able to handle Joker in the fight, Joker catches him off-guard with a crowbar and is violently beating him with it when Batman shows up and ends it. Batman carries Dick's beaten and bloodied body away and hands The Joker over to the authorities.

 

Joker is tried for his crimes with Dent handling prosecution, but The Joker manages to pull off an acid attack in court, splashing half of Dent's face. Joker is able to plead insanity as a plea-bargain to avoid a possible mistrial as Batman's citizen's arrest may be thrown out in court. The Joker is institutionalized at Arkham Asylum. In the end of the film, The Joker is introduced to his therapist: Dr. Harleen Quinzel.

 

Batman: Year 3 - Captain Gordon is now Commissioner Gordon and taken control of the police, and it's just in time as Two-Face has re-organized crime in Gotham and all but taken over. To make matters worse, an unknown and mysterious figure or organization mounted an attack on Blackgate Prison and Arkham Asylum, flooding Gotham's streets with criminals and maniacs, including The Joker. Dr. Harleen Quinzel believes she's the person best suited to bringing in The Joker and has a run-in with Batman that confirms what she already believed about him: he's the cause of the problems in Gotham and responsible for The Joker. When she finally finds The Joker, having returned to the now-condemned chemical factory, he lures her in and gives her a taste of what he experienced. She emerges Harley Quinn.

 

With so much chaos in the city with organized and disorganized crime, Batman finally relents and allows Dick to join him, but only as a sidekick, to hang back, to cover him, to help him out, etc. He is not to confront anyone directly. It turns out, they make an amazing team.

 

Two-Face is now struggling to control the criminal element as there's so much on the street, but he's amassing an army in the hopes of taking over Gotham completely. It's all-out war between Two-Face's empire and the Gotham police, and of course Batman, but Two-Face has a vendetta against The Joker, The Joker wants to kill Two-Face, Gordon, the police, Gotham in general, and Batman, and Batman now feels responsible for the whole lot of them.

 

The Joker retaliates against Two-Face for his repeated attempts to kill him, undermining Two-Face's plans, but in the final confrontation, neither Batman, Robin, nor Harley Quinn are able to stop Two-Face from apparently killing The Joker. Harley tries to kill Two-Face, Batman, and Robin, but is stopped in a combined effort. Batman tries to appeal to Dent, who finally turns himself in.

 

While being taken away, Dent reveals to Batman that he's been two sides of the same coin all along. He's always been the District Attorney, and it was really Dent who undermined Two-Face, not The Joker. He explains that his efforts to organize all the criminals and maniacs was so they could all collectively be put away in a set-up he devised. When he's asked to explain the Blackgate and Arkham breaks, he says that wasn't him, it was "Bane."

 

"Bane?" "He never gave me a name. He only said 'bane.' The bane of Batman, the bane of Gotham, the bane of everything. He told me this city wasn't mine, yours, or Gordon's. Gotham belongs to him." "Bane..." The last shot is Bane watching Batman through binoculars as Batman closes the doors on the ambulance Dent is in. Quietly he says, "Yes, Batman. Bane."

 

The fun part is, when you watch the movie again and look really hard, Bane can often be seen somewhere in the background, just watching.

 

Batman: Year 4 - In part 4, Batman   Robin are forced to constantly put out fires, sometimes literally. A cat-burglar is confronted and put on notice, Firefly is spreading dangerous arsons, Zsasz is a serial killer on the loose, the chemist Scarecrow has released a fear-toxic causing people to go mad, an eco-terrorist calling herself Poison Ivy is causing havoc, a man called "The Penguin" has taken over organized crime in the absence of Two-Face, a mad scientist calling himself "Freeze" has frozen half the city, and some idiot calling himself "The Riddler" is committing crimes and leaving clues. Batman   Robin are able to bring Firefly, Zsasz, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, and Riddler to justice, but not without consequences. Batman has been badly burned, stabbed, psychologically scarred by fear toxin, worn down by Poison Ivy's toxins, and mentally exhausted by The Riddler. When he finally agrees to Alfred's demands that he come home and rest before dealing with Freeze or Penguin, he checks in with Robin, who is still doing recon on The Penguin and Freeze, and then he arrives home to the Batcave. Once he accesses the secret entrance to the mansion, he finds Alfred unconscious and is then attacked by Bane.

 

Bane takes a physically, mentally, and psychologically exhausted Batman and kicked the ever-living shit out of him right into the Bat Cave for an epic battle. He reveals that he (obviously) knows his secret identity and that he's been lying in wait since the beginning to take Gotham from Batman. In the final scene, he breaks Batman's back, drops him to the ground and says, "Broken and done. Gotham now belongs to Bane."

 

Batman: Year 5 - One year after the breaking of the bat, a now-20-year-old Dick Greyson has assumed the identity of Batman with one instruction from Bruce: do not confront Bane directly. The first part of the movie is the new Batman taking down the tragic villain Freeze.

 

Not only is Dick doing an amazingly good job of keeping the Batman myth alive, but a new presence has emerged in the form of what the media has dubbed "Batgirl." It appears Catwoman is at least sometimes on the side of righteousness as well, so Dick isn't entirely alone out there.

 

Bane doesn't control Gotham yet. The Penguin still controls half of Gotham, and they're warring constantly. Bane doesn't go after this new Batman right away because he seems to be focused on Penguin almost exclusively, so he believes he and Batgirl to be unconnected to the original Batman.

 

With a budding romance between Dick and Batgirl, who is Gordon's daughter, Catwoman lurks in the background, possibly jealous, and Bane hopes to use this. She's been caught stealing from him a number of times, and when he finally gets his hands on her, he lures her to his side. He wants her to work directly with the new Batman and Batgirl to take down The Penguin, which they absolutely do.

 

Catwoman turns on them, which sets them up for Bane. He says he'll take pleasure in breaking two more bats, which he may very well accomplish, but Catwoman double-crosses Bane, setting him up for his own downfall at the hands of Batman and Batgirl. Bane still manages to get the upper-hand thanks to his Venom, but that's when a Batwing flies overhead, a smoke bomb his the ground, and when the smoke clears, the real, original Batman is standing tall in a modified, armored, cybernetic- enhanced suit. Catwoman, meanwhile, gets away with much of Bane's fortune, so she played him for a fool.

 

Bane and Bruce battle it out as Dick and Barbara clear the area. Bane is enhanced by Venom, and Bruce is enhanced by his suit, so it's a pretty fair fight. In the end, Batman takes down Bane and reclaims his city. With Freeze, Penguin, and Bane out of the picture, Gotham is safe again.

 

Finally safe in her own home, Barbara enjoys some quality time with her dad. There's a knock at the door, she answers, BLAM! She's shot through the spine by The Joker.

 

Batman: Year 6 - The Joker is back. Two-Face didn't kill him after all. Yes, he was tossed into heavy machinery that apparently ground him up, but the remains turned out not to be his. The Joker takes Barbara Gordon and kidnaps Jim as well. Now it's up to Batman and Nightwing to save them both and finally stop Joker once and for all. This movie would basically be an adaptation of Alan Moore's "Killing Joke."

 

Nightwing spin-off movie follows Year 6.

 


































 Ah, that delightful meme is going around Facebook again: Dear god, why do you allow violence in our schools? "I'm not allowed in schools." ~ God.

1. An omnipotent being is not "allowed?" Doesn't sound too fucking powerful to me.

2. Just to clear something up, god is "allowed" in schools; god isn't allowed to be forced upon students. There's a difference between having a right to worship and having someone else's religion shoved down your throat.

3. So the argument here is that god is either too weak to be where he isn't wanted (by some), is too butthurt by the slight, or it isn't important enough for him to "break the rules" and intervene? So this meme basically shows that your god is impotent, petty, uncaring, sucks and is unworthy of worship.

Nicely done, Christians. Point well made. 




 Not terrible, but definitely not a fun night. I took entirely too much 2CE (a dab'll do ya) and the whole world just fell apart on me. The shit came on like a freight train. Before I could even react to an emergence of fractal patterns, suddenly, everything around me transformed into wild animations, and not simple shapes, either. For example, a tree in a neighboring apartment complex turned into a cluster of Chinese dragons desperately trying to untangle themselves. I actually said out loud, "How is that even possible? Where's the context?" My wife was too overwhelmed to answer.

I tried to relax and watch Fantasia, but that wasn't working out. I went out to smoke a cigarette, but the smoke trails were interacting with everything confusingly, and I mentally projected that everywhere. I ended up just going to bed, but it was dizzying because the closed-eye hallucination were a thousand time worse. I couldn't control my thoughts, and even rationalizing that I willfully took a drug and that's why this was happening became a difficult thought to hold onto. For the first time in my life, I mentally wished for a trip to end. I wanted off the ride.

I'm not at all mad, though. I'm 31 and started getting into psychedelics with LSD when I was 18. I've had plenty of fun with LSD and shrooms, and this was my third time with 2CE. I thought I was immune to the fabled "bad trip" and had far too positive an opinion of tripping to be subject to such a thing, but I learned a valuable lesson: I'm not invincible, there is such a thing as "too much," and moderation can be a beautiful thing.

Now I'm curious. What's the worst trip you've ever had, what drug was it, and was it because you took too much, or the conditions were all wrong? 














 Full disclosure: I'm putting the finishing touches on my final, which is a paper on Shakespeare's *Hamlet*. I've read it, I've watched two film adaptations, I've got additional sources, but are there any Shakespeare scholars or experts here (or just fans) who have special insights they'd like to share? 

I'm not looking for someone to write my paper for me. I'm looking for new ways of looking at things, different interpretations, historical contexts I may have overlooked, hidden meanings, etc. I'm sure my professor has read hundreds of papers on Shakespeare, and I'd like to give him something he's never read before. Thanks! 












































 Lame example: You can't have your cake and eat it too.

What else would you do with cake but eat it? 









 FDR and Johnson were two of the more socialist presidents our nation has ever had, both bringing about sweeping reform and program implementation, some of which is still in place today, from FDR's social security to Johnson's Medicare   Medicaid. Yet, knowing from history the fantastic improvements that were made via implementation of such programs and economic booms experienced under such leadership, why do you suppose socialism has long been a dirty word in this country? It seems many of the same people who would slam big government and demand reductions would never want to part with social security, Medicare and Medicaid.

Is it, perhaps, cultural? Is it historical? Are we a product of the uprising that brought about our Independence, as such that we are the freed rebels in constant fear or oppression and tyranny? Is it just the Spirit of '76 that lives on in us? Is it remnants of the Red Scare, The Cold War and McCarthyism? 




 The title character is villainous scum! Am I actually supposed to feel sorry for him when he dies? 




 At the beginning of the play, Richard breaks the fourth wall and invites the audience to live vicariously through him, but after the first few scenes, he just... stops. Why would Shakespeare abandon that device? More importantly, why do it at all? It seems like he had an idea and was doing something differently, and then forgot. It seems odd to start that way and not follow-through. 




 Since discovering r/shakespeare, I've really begun to appreciate Shakespeare more, especially in the discussions where an expert comes in and shines a light on something I never would have known or thought of.

That makes me wonder; what mind-blowing Shakespeare theories do you have? It could be any of his plays, Shakespeare himself, or differing ways of viewing certain characters, motives, lines, etc. Fan theories, different perspectives, historical knowledge... anything a Shakespeare fan might find eye-opening. 













































































































 I used to just slap ham and American cheese on bread with some mustard and call that a sandwich. I was wrong. 

My sandwich:

1. Warm a pan with butter in it so the butter melts while you're building the sandwich. 

2. Once the butter melts, add two strips of bacon.

3. Take two slices of stone-ground 100% whole wheat bread.

4. On one slice, add Southwest spicy mustard. 

5. On the other slice, add mayonnaise.

6. Add a slice of jalapeo jack cheese to each slice of bread. If you want a spicier experience, Cabbot makes a habanero jack cheese.

7. Choose a slice and add one slice of fresh tomato, off the vine, never having been refrigerated. 

8. Alternately layer deli sliced ham and turkey at a deli slice thickness of 1 until you have a stack proportionate to your appetite. 

9. Add deli pickles. Two or three should be fine.

10. Top it all off with one crunchy and crisp slice of iceberg lettuce.

11. Close the sandwich and press down on it hard to keep everything squished together tight. 

12. Remove the bacon when it's finished cooking. And set it aside on a paper towel. In the time it takes to build the sandwich, the bacon should be done.

13. Throw that bad boy sandwich into the pan with the bacon grease and butter and fry it up. After about a minute, skillfully use both hands and two spatulas to flip it over to cook the other side. While trying, try adding a bit of Goya Adobo. It doesn't take much.

14. Remove the sandwich and add the bacon.

15. Eat sandwich.

16. Orgasm. 

PS: I want to try your sandwiches. If you try mine, let me know what you think. I will gladly let you know if yours is better than mine ;-) 




 I was surprised to search r/Shakespeare and not find a single reference to the Tudor myth. Does anyone have any insight on the accusations that the histories (only English histories being labeled as such while Scottish and Roman histories fall into "tragedy") are Tudor propaganda, and that Shakespeare is, in fact, the history's greatest propagator of the Tutor myth? 





























 Preferably nothing biased, just a historical rundown of how a religion was corrupted into extremist/terrorist groups over time, important historical events, people, etc. who shaped Islamic fundamentalism into what it is today.

 The US declares tomorrow that all troops worldwide are to return home by the end of 2014. All US presence beyond our own borders is removed globally. A doctrine of isolationism is implemented so far as it concerns our military and foreign aid. We don't send troops, we don't drone strike, we don't bomb, we don't sanction, we don't diddly squat.

What would happen? 



















 The easy method is Batman's birthday, 1985 deduced from Batman #010, Year Zero Directors Cut. Bruce Wayne is Born. (Date inferred Willowood and Wayne Death correlations. Willowood fell into disrepute after Martha died when Bruce was 10, but it was likely not that long after, and the sickhole happened 18 years ago. This also correlates to Bruce taking off as soon as possible, 18, which is consistent with everything else.) 

Thomas   Martha are murdered when Bruce is 10 in 1995. Damian is born in 1999 (Batman   Robin #0) somehow even though Bruce Wayne would only be 14 and doesn't leave Gotham until 2000 (Batman #0). Bruce returns to Gotham in 2004 (Detective Comics #0). He's now 19. Damian would be 5 going by this insanity.

In 2005, Bruce is a vigilante trying to save Gotham City from The Red Hood and his gang (Batman #0).

2006: Tim Drake attends Graystone Academy (in Middle School) as their top academic student and is taking gymnastics. He hacked the school's network and caught the principal embezzling funds and turned him in. At the exact same time, Jason Todd robbed a convenience store with a friend(?) who shot a scared woman. Jason in moral outrage beat his friend(?) down and allowed himself to be arrested. The Bat-Signal is lit by Commissioner Gordon for the first time. Dick Grayson's parents fall to their death due to Tony Zucco tampering with the trapeze equipment. Dick is then sent to an orphanage, The Wayne Care Center. (Batman #0)

That ***same year*** Dick Grayson becomes Robin. (Nightwing #1).

That ***same year*** Barbara Gordon becomes Batgirl.

So Bruce Wayne has been active one year as a vigilante and already has a kid sidekick and inspired a female crime fighter.

2007: Barbara gives up being Batgirl after only one year to focus on college. (Batgirl #0)

2008: Alan Moore's *The Killing Joke* happens, officially NewFiftyTwoniverse Cannon. As a reminder, Batman is apparently 23 in this book. Damian is 9 and still unknown to his father.

2009: Jason Todd resurrected. When exactly he died or became Robin is hard to figure out, but it couldn't have been for very long. Damian Wayne defeats his mother in a birthday challenge and learns Bruce Wayne is his father. Batman is 24, Damian is 10, so yes, somehow Bruce fathered Damian when he was 14 with a woman he'd never met a good six or seven years before he became Batman. WTF?

2010: The events of Batman, Inc #0 take place.

2011: The "present" of the New52 launch in most titles which has advanced generally in real time since.

So Batman/Bruce Wayne is roughly 29 and has managed to have four Robins in a vigilante/costumed adventurer/superhero career of about nine years. By DC compressing decades of continuity to keep all these characters they've built and established, Batman has Dick Greyson as a costumed sidekick almost immediately, loses him when Dick starts the first Titans--vaguely referenced in Red Hood   The Outlaws--Batman almost instantly replaces Dick with Jason who must then die almost the next day, then he gets replaced by Tim who goes off and forms the current Teen Titans, and then Damian comes along, who Bruce apparently fathered at age 14 because that makes sense.

DC Comics has created a clusterfuck of plotholes in their new timeline.

***EDIT***

To offer what would make more sense if I was running this shit:

Martha   Thomas murdered when Bruce is 10.

Bruce returns to Gotham at age 18 after training all over the world. He does the masked vigilante bullshit for about a year, has little luck, is about to give it up when ***BAM!!!*** the bat thing happens and he's inspired. Becomes Batman, a complete badass but inexperienced. Suit is too armored because he's not too good at dodging bullets yet, and he relies too heavily on Alfred and technology to get by. 19-year-old Batman is nothing like the Batman we know and love, but DC sells his stories in the monthly back-in-the-day series called "Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight." These stories are interesting because we see a flawed Batman who doesn't always win his fights, fucks up, fails, and hasn't mentally killed off Bruce Wayne yet. He's still trying to balance Bruce and the bat because he hasn't realized he needs to sacrifice his life to become the hero Gotham needs.

Five years later, Batman is getting insanely good. He's dropped a lot of the tech and armor in favor of lightweight, stealth, ninja shit. He looks more like a ninja than a stealth, militaristic man-tank. Alfred is there when he needs him, but Bruce is much more capable on his own and far less reliant on tech and gear. He's also established now. Criminals fear him and Gordon is with him rather than against him, plus, Gordon has been promoted through the ranks and is now commissioner. The Bat Signal scares the shit out of people and is a hallmark of Gotham. Batman is only 24, but 5 years in, Batman is already the stuff of legend. However, Batman has steadily taken the place of Bruce Wayne. Alfred reminds Bruce of an obligation. He attends Haly's Circus and witnesses the death of 10-year-old Dick Grayson's parents. Relates hard. Epic feels. Takes in kid as ward. Feels bad man.

Over the next year, Dick puts the pieces together. Witnesses Alfred doing his medical shit for Bruce after a bad night. Last shreds of doubt are gone: shitty fake rich dad man is Batman. Dick sees Batman as the means to get revenge on Tony Zucco. Bruce takes him under his wing, trains him, and Robin: The Boy Wonder is born. Batman is 25, Robin is only 11. They are the Dynamic Duo, forming one of the greatest relationships in comics. DC sells the stores of this time period as Robin: The Boy Wonder. Great comic. Such sales. When Dick is 16, they have a falling out. Five years of Batman   Robin comes to an end at Dick goes off to found the original Teen Titans. Batman grows dark as shit without Robin to balance him out. Batman is now 30. 

Also noteworthy: the original Batgirl, Barbara Gordon, begins and ends in this time period. When Batgirl first appears, Batman is 26, Robin is 12, and Barbara is 17. Batman disapproves, Robin crushes hard. The three end up making a sensational team. When Batman figures out Batgirl is Barbara Gordon, he's crippled by guilt. Batgirl operates for four years, quitting at 21 only to be shot through the spine by The Joker in a home invasion because The Killing Joke is cannon forever. 30-year-old Batman is mentally broken by this incident, and it drives Dick away. He's losing his shit.

At age 22, Barbara Gordon becomes The Oracle, an essential part of Batman's operation and lending support to Dick's Teen Titans. Batman is now 31. Bruce and Dick speak to each other only through Barbara and are otherwise estranged. Dick is now Nightwing. At age 23, Oracle founds The Birds of Prey, passing on the Batgirl identity to either Cassandra Cain. She also works closely with her best friend and ally The Black Canary, Stephanie Brown AKA: The Spoiler, and Helena Bertinelli AKA: The Huntress. Batman is now 32 and a 15-year-old kid named Tim Drake has figured out his identity.

Tim Drake is obsessed with Batman   Robin. Batgirl, too. He's a boy genius, a black belt, the top student in his school, and has hacking skills second only to Barbara. He wants to be the new Robin, and nothing Bruce says or does as Bruce or Batman will change his mind. Barbara tricks Bruce and Dick into meeting. Bruce eventually reveals the Tim Drake problem, and Dick says he already knows. How? Barbara. Dick surprises Bruce by encouraging him to take the boy under his wing like he did for him because Batman needs a Robin, but it can't be Dick anymore. 

Batman has a Robin again. Batman is 33. Tim is 16, the same age Dick was when he left Bruce's side. DC explores these stories in the ongoing Batman   Robin comic as well as Gotham Knights, a book featuring the dream team of Batman, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Oracle, and other Gotham vigilantes inspired by Batman like Huntress, The Spoiler, Catwoman, Batwoman, etc.

You'll notice Jason Todd didn't exist. No one other than Dick   Tim have ever been Robin, and if Damian Wayne is going to be introduced, it hasn't happened yet but could down the line, preferably around the same time Bruce is either about to die or retire so Dick can become Batman and Damian his Robin.

Realistically, Batman either dies in the line of duty before he ever makes it to 40 or retires to be replaced by Dick Grayson either way.

I'm sorry, but you don't just go through sidekicks like dirty laundry. It's ridiculous. 
























 I once had a can of Easy Cheese but no Ritz crackers so... 



















 I'm 33, I want to buy a house, my credit is terrible (599), and I have no savings. 

Can I still do this? Is there a zero down option? Where do I even begin?

 









 I'm 33 and I want to buy a house. I'm tired of wasting money on rent. That being said, I've found it impossible to save the kind of money to make a serious down payment. Can I borrow 100% of the cost and accept a higher monthly mortgage? 




 My wife and I just moved from San Antonio, Texas to Laconia, New Hampshire. We are currently unemployed, just about run out of money, and have no insurance. My daughter is complaining of pretty severe tooth pain, and there's an obvious cavity. What can we do?

***EDIT***: Thank you all so much for your help! Just to let everyone know--and I appreciate your concern--she has been seen by a dentist and is scheduled for dental work. You people are awesome! 




 I left NH for two years, came back, and suddenly Molly doesn't exist? 




 So I have an idea. My wife doing what she does for a living (outreach therapist) gets exposed to all these kids who get flat out rejected by their own families for being gay. Some get kicked out, others are simply made to feel like they're less-than-human, others want to kill themselves upon finding themselves unloved by their own families, etc.

That's all a whole lot of bullshit.

So I want to start an orphanage of sorts. Anyone from anywhere in the US finds themselves in one of these shitty situations, they can move into the Jackson Pride: A Sanctuary for LGBT Youth. Until they're 18, they'd have a safe place to stay where they are loved and supported by a staff made up of LGBT and LGBT-friendly people such as myself.

I'd need a shitload of money. It'd have to be grants and charitable donations because I can't see any way to make such a thing profitable. Does anyone have the first clue where to start on a thing like this? This might be my calling.

 Before anyone corrects me, I'm not claiming this is The Great Gatsby: A Phantom Menace. But...

Aside from names, it's basically what logically happens before The Great Gatsby. 

Jay Gatsby is Dexter. 

Comes from middle class family. Father owns the second-best grocery store in town.

Aspires to be part of the old money, upper crust elite.

Meets Judy/Daisy.

Loves her. Loses her because she's old money elite; he's not. 

Couple of affairs.

Loser in love. Goes to war as we know Gatsby did. Never forgets her.

He returns. Gets filthy rich. Success. Still loves Judy/Daisy. Finds out from a friend that she's married now and the guy is a dick. Name is Joe Simms but he sounds an awful lot like Tom Buchanan. He cheats on her just like Tom. She doesn't cheat. She stays home with the kids.

He's still alive at the end and very much contemplating the Judy/Daisy situation.

 Batman and all his allies defending Gotham City featuring Batman (Bruce Wayne), Robin (Damian Wayne), Red Robin (Timothy Drake), Nightwing (Dick Grayson), Spoiler (Stephanie Brown), Batgirl (Cassandra Caine), Oracle (Barbara Gordon), Huntress (Helena Bertinelli), The Red Hood (Jason Todd), Catwoman (Selina Kyle), Black Canary (Dinah Lance), Katana (Tatsu Yamashiro), Cheshire (Jade Nguyen), Batwoman (Katie Kane), Ragman (Rory Regan), and maybe even some variation of Azrael and/or Batwing.

Additional cast featuring Alfred, Lucius Fox, Commissioner Gordon, Rene Montoya, Detective Alvarez, Harvey Bullock, Harvey Dent, Maggie Sawyer, Leslie Thompkins, and Vicki Vale.

You don't have to get all detailed about each character's origins or how they ended up where they are, and it'd be largely based on Morrison's "Batman, Inc." run, which means it involves Talia's all-out assault on Gotham, a call to arms of all Batman's allies, Bruce Wayne is out as Batman's financial backer, Damian dies, and there's a fuckload of cameos. Three-hour epic.

 Before anybody tells me about Monster, jobs.com, etc., yes, I know. I'm exploring those, but /r/sanantonio has been awesomely helpful with everything I've ever needed.

I'm 32, I have an associates in graphic design, I have experience as a delivery driver, I don't mind desk or labor work, I'd prefer first shift, I'd consider part time or full, benefits aren't needed, I look professional (no visible tats or piercings of any kind), I'm reliable, have reliable transportation (2009 Scion XB), I'm in school for English education, and I've been a substitute teacher. 

Any leads would be appreciated. 





























 As insane as this sounds, I've done the research. It's plausible. The idea isn't original; it was first proposed by Carlyle Thompson, a professor of African American and American literature at Medgar Evers College of the City University of New York. There's actually quite a bit of evidence to support it, just as there is to support the queer reading of Nick.

Gatsby is described by Nick, "his tanned skin" and "short hair look as though it were trimmed every day" (Fitzgerald 50). The short hair and the appearance of daily trimmings could definitely refer to the grooming habits of African American men.

Gatsby's West Egg mansion is on "more than 40 acres of lawn and garden" (Fitzgerald 5), which is specifically interesting, because freed slaves were to be given 40 acres and a mule by decree of Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15. "More than" is stated, but instead of giving us that exact number--it could be 41 acres or 400--but we're given 40. It should be noted that 40 acres and a mule was oft promised, but a promise not always kept and inconsistently applied (Oubre 79). There's an obvious metaphor for a man who feels deserving of something he doesn't get, i.e., Daisy.

Gatsby would be unlikely to achieve the level of success he did in the roaring 20s if he were black, and some of the upper-crust white folk would be likely to notice or take issue with his race, so it's only a plausible theory if he were able to pass himself off as white. There is evidence for this, too. For one, the manner in which he makes his fortune is bootlegging during prohibition, and bootlegging is a sort of counterfeit product. That could be a metaphor as Gatsby is a counterfeit person. He pretends to be someone he's not, he seeks an imagined perfection of a flawed woman, he lies about his past, he's secretive about what he does and his intentions, and being a man of color could be just one more lie he's living. He's even changed his name from Gatz to Gatsby, something more Nordic-sounding.

Gatsby is quite proud of his heroism in Montenegro. Of all the places he could have earned a medal, it's one where the word "negro" is right in the name--negro/black, mont/mountain--and it's mentioned by name seven times immediately like Fitzgerald wanted it to stand out. Also, his valor at Montenegro was immediately proved true by the medal Gatsby carried around. In other words, Gatsby lies, but the "negro" part is the truth.

How do we know he lies? He just told us on the previous page, "I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West--all dead now" (Fitzgerald 65). We know for a fact later on that his father remains alive and is far-from-wealthy. Was his family dead, or was he dead to his family on account of his color? "I was brought up in American but educated at Oxford, becaue all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It's a family tradition" (Fitzgerald 65). He's awfully concerned with establishing a European heritage.

But here's the passage that really blew my mind with this reading:

        ...a limousine passed us, driven by a white
        chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I
        laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in
        haughty rivalry.

        "Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge," I thought;
        "anything at all. . . ."

        Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder. (Fitzgerald 69)

First, let's note that this happens as they are crossing Blackwell's island. Again, a geographical location is used that denotes "black."

According to Merriam-Webster's online dictionary, "Modish" means "Conforming to or following what is currently popular and fashionable." In other words, these are African American men who turned the social paradigm on its head and are being driven by a white chauffeur. In spite of a possible slave heritage, they are able to afford the luxuries of the time, looking at Gatsby, his ride, and his present company with a sense of rivalry. If these black men are able to realize the American dream, surely a man of African descent who can pass for white can achieve this success. Yes, anything is possible, even Gatsby. Even a black Gatsby.

There are smaller clues, too. After Myrtle is struck by a car, the incoherent speech of a man is "M-a-v-r-o----," which is interesting, because "mavro" is Greek for "black."

One the same page, a "pale well-dressed negro" described the car, Gatsby's car, as "big" and "yellow." Now back to the Montenegro thing, which literally means "black mountain," which may describe Gatsby, big and yellow may also describe him as "high yellow" was a term to describe light-skinned blacks, the product of mixed race backgrounds due to the golden skin tone (Dalzell, 2009). He may be a "black mountain" of a man, but he's also "high" like a mountain, but, although technically black, also "yellow."

Is this a meaningless distinction? No. It's not trivial at all. Tom Buchanan is an awful human being, and we're treated to Tom's racist rant:

        Have you read 'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard? . . . Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved. . . Well, these books are all scientific . . . This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things . . . This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are and . . . and we've produced all the things that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that. (Fitzgerald 12-13)

How are we supposed to feel about this? Well, Daisy openly mocks him and Nick says he's pathetic. Tom believes that the Nordics are the master race and that it's imperative for him and people like him to keep the colored folk down. Wouldn't there then be great irony on his wife's competing love with a non-Nordic person? A black Gatsby?

It's at least a suspicion on Tom's part when he puts the pieces together and outs his fears:

        I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that's the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white. (Fitzgerald 130)

        "We're all white here," murmured Jordan. (Fitzgerald 130)

Not only does Tom suggest that Gatsby is black, Jordan picks up on it and defends his whiteness! Why else would intermarriage between black and white even be brought up? He may have even suspected this for a long time before, pausing before he includes Daisy as a Nordic in the Goddard rant with a wink and a smile when he lays out the Goddard nonsense. Perhaps he sees her as sullied having had her history with Gatsby.

The trouble is, there's plenty of evidence to suggest that Fitzgerald was both a racist and antisemitic (Blogger.com 2010). That really changes the perspective. That underscores what Fitzgerald's true intentions were in the Goddard passage from the book, actually The Rising Tide of Color: Against White World-Supremacy, by eugenicist Lothrop Stoddard, published in 1920 (Turlish 1973). Fitzgerald was obviously familiar with it. It's even more interesting to note that both Fitzgerald and Stoddard had the same publisher, Scribner. As for the name change, Henry H. Goddard was a famous eugenicist (Thompson 2004). The plot thickens.

It forces one to consider that Gatsby is a cautionary figure, that negro men could be among us, passing themselves off as white, throwing lavish parties, living the lifestyle, wooing our women, acting as elaborate con artists, bootlegging, and involved in all manner of illicit affairs. Maybe that's the real reason he doesn't win in the end. Maybe that's why he's killed, as white men conspire against him. Maybe that's the real reason no one shows up to his funeral.

* If you didn't get the joke, this is (mostly) untrue. 
























 I had to write this out for a class, and I thought some Redditors might be able to benefit. Please feel free to add.

* Don't like the gym? Don't limit yourself to it. Run, bike, skateboard, Rollerblade, jog, dance, swim, climb, join a sports team/league, etc.
    

* Find a schedule that works for you and stick to it. Someone asks you to lunch at 12:30pm on Friday? Nope. That's your scheduled gym time. Take a rain-check.
    

* Sign up for classes. Exercise doesn't have to mean treadmills, ellipticals, or weights. Try new things, meet new people, and have fun. Try yoga. Try zumba. Try boot camp. Try core training. Try belly dancing and/or pole dancing if you must. Be adventurous.
    

* Have a run first thing in the morning when you wake up. It'll jolt you to life, give you more energy, almost guarantee you'll make time for a healthy breakfast, and once you're showered, you'll be good to go, probably in a better mood to boot. Go get life.
   

* Meet a friend at your scheduled gym at scheduled times or activities so you'd feel bad leaving them hanging. Tell that friend to give you a hard time if you skip a day or slack.
    
* Don't feel like going? Go. Tell yourself you'll phone it in today. Tell yourself you'll take it easy. Showing up is half the battle. Once you're there, you'll probably feel like you might as well get a good workout in if you're there anyway.
    
* Set realistic goals for yourself. Put them down on paper.


* Skip escalators and stairs, walk or ride your bike if it's not too far, park further away from the grocery store, and find other little ways to work in extra exercise into your daily life.


* Reward yourself for meeting goals/expectations, but not with cake and pies. 




 Do you prefer one above all others? Do some ethnicities do things or have characteristics that you find sexy or a turn-off? Were you consciously trying to have sex with a variety of races? How would you rate your experiences overall?

Curious because I'm a married white male who has only had sex with white women, not by choice, but because New Hampshire is a very white place. I assume I'll die never having known the difference, assuming there are any. 




 Booster Gold   Blue Beetle! Hollywood is missing out on a great opportunity to make a superhero/comic book movie that is completely unlike the rest, and actually use it to satire superhero/comic book movies. It could have plenty of action, but also a lot of comedy, and more bromance than JD   Turk in a season of Scrubs. 









 A friend posted in our local (San Antonio) Facebook forum asking advice for overcoming writer's block. People seemed to like my response, so I thought I'd share:

You're over-thinking it. Stop. A*** A**** has great advice, but if you're not in the reading mood, don't do that either. Don't do anything, writing especially. If you're a comedian, funny things will come to you. You have a gift for being able to see the comedy in situations people experience every day of their lives, but they either don't see it or make the normal choice not to make a big deal of it. That's YOUR job.

If nothing is coming to you, don't panic. This is a great time to pull out your old jokes. If they're in a notebook, transcribe them to a Word document or otherwise create a document you can organize. Re-read your jokes. Try to approach those jokes from different angles. Figure out a way to connect jokes where some continuity may exist for good transitions. If you need better transitions, write those.

Think of that time some dumb drunk bitch said some dumb drunk bitch thing during your set. Now think of what you wish you had said to her. Maybe it's about her being a dumb drunk bitch. Now you have heckler ammo in your pocket.

Write and re-write your old shit and before you know it, you'll be writing new shit because you just inspired yourself to write and be creative.

If you car won't start, you give it a jump. That's all you need. The car is fucking fine.

 




 My wife and I are happily married and new San Antonio residents as of last year. Our 5th anniversary is this weekend, and I'm hoping to take her out on a hot date. Money is not an issue. I just want it to be memorable. 

She's an artist, very into dance, music, or any kind of art, really. It doesn't have to be anything like that, either, just a fun night out on the town.

I haven't lived here long enough to know where to go/what to do. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! 




 ***Tax exemptions for churches violate the separation of church and state*** enshrined in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the US Constitution. By providing a financial benefit to religious institutions, government is supporting religion. Associate Justice of the US Supreme court, William O. Douglas, in his dissenting opinion in Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York, decided May 4, 1970, stated: "If believers are entitled to public financial support, so are nonbelievers. A believer and nonbeliever under the present law are treated differently because of the articles of their faith I conclude that this tax exemption is unconstitutional."

***A tax exemption is a privilege, not a right.*** Governments have traditionally granted this privilege to churches because of the positive contribution they are presumed to make to the community, but there is no such provision in the US Constitution.

***Churches receive special treatment from the IRS beyond what other nonprofits receive***, and such favoritism is unconstitutional. While secular charities are compelled to report their income and financial structure to the IRS using Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax), churches are granted automatic exemption from federal income tax without having to file a tax return.

***A tax break for churches forces all American taxpayers to support religion***, even if they oppose some or all religious doctrines. As Mark Twain argued: "no church property is taxed and so the infidel and the atheist and the man without religion are taxed to make up the deficit in the public income thus caused."

***A tax exemption is a form of subsidy, and the Constitution bars government from subsidizing religion.*** William H. Rehnquist, then-Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, declared on behalf of a unanimous court in Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983): "Both tax exemptions and tax deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system. A tax exemption has much the same effect as a cash grant to the organization of the amount of tax it would have to pay on its income."

***The tax code makes no distinction between authentic religions and fraudulent startup "faiths,"*** which benefit at taxpayers' expense. In spring 2010, Oklahoma awarded tax exempt status to Satanist group The Church of the IV Majesties. In Mar. 2004, the IRS warned of an increase in schemes that "exploit legitimate laws to establish sham one-person, nonprofit religious corporations" charging $1,000 or more per person to attend "seminars." The Church of Scientology, which TIME Magazine described in May 1991 as a "thriving cult of greed and power" and "a hugely profitable global racket," was granted federal income tax exemption in Oct. 1993. The New York Times reported that this "saved the church tens of millions of dollars in taxes." 

***Churches serve a religious purpose that does not aid the government***, so their tax exemptions are not justified. Tax exemptions to secular nonprofits like hospitals and homeless shelters are justified because such organizations do work that would otherwise fall to government. Churches, while they may undertake charitable work, exist primarily for religious worship and instruction, which the US government is constitutionally prevented from performing.

***Exempting churches from taxation costs the government billions of dollars in lost revenue***, which it cannot afford, especially in tough economic times. According to former White House senior policy analyst Jeff Schweitzer, PhD, US churches own $300-$500 billion in untaxed property. New York's nonpartisan Independent Budget Office determined in July 2011 that New York City alone loses $627 million in property tax revenue. Lakewood Church, a "megachurch" in Houston, TX, earns $75 million in annual untaxed revenue, and the Church of Scientology's annual income exceeds $500 million.

***Despite the 1954 law banning political campaigning by tax-exempt groups, many churches are clearly political and therefore should not be receiving tax exemptions***. Every fall, the Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian legal group, organizes "Pulpit Freedom Sunday," encouraging pastors to defy IRS rules by endorsing candidates from the pulpit. More than 500 pastors participated in Oct. 2011, yet none lost their churches' exemption status. In Oct. 2010, Minnesota pastor Brad Brandon of Berean Bible Baptist Church endorsed several Republican candidates and dared the "liberal media" to file complaints with the IRS. Brandon later announced on his radio program: "I'm going to explain to you what happened Nothing happened."

***American taxpayers are supporting the extravagant lifestyles of wealthy pastors***, whose lavish "megachurches" accumulate millions of tax-free dollars every year. US Senator Chuck Grassley, MA (R-IA) launched an investigation into these groups in Nov. 2007 after receiving complaints of church revenue being used to buy pastors private jets, Rolls Royce cars, multimillion-dollar homes, trips to Hawaii and Fiji, and in one case, a $23,000, marble-topped chest of drawers installed in the 150,000 square foot headquarters of Joyce Meyer Ministries in Fenton, Missouri.

***The tax break given to churches restricts their freedom of speech because it deters pastors from speaking out for or against political candidates***. As argued by Rev. Carl Gregg, pastor of Maryland's Broadview Church, "when Christians speak, we shouldn't have to worry about whether we are biting the hand that feeds us because we shouldn't be fed from Caesar/Uncle Sam in the first place." 

***The "parsonage exemption" on ministers' homes makes already-wealthy pastors even richer at taxpayers' expense.*** The average annual salary for senior pastors with congregations of 2,000 or more is $147,000, with some earning up to $400,000. In addition to the federal exemption on housing expenses enjoyed by these ministers, they often pay zero dollars in state property tax. Church leaders Creflo and Taffi Dollar of World Changers Church International had three tax-free parsonages: a million-dollar mansion in Atlanta, GA, a two-million-dollar mansion in Fayetteville, GA, and a $2.5 million Manhattan apartment. Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, leaders of Kenneth Copeland Ministries in Fort Worth, TX, live in a church-owned, tax-free $6.2 million lakefront parsonage.

 Going out again? Put on new socks. Go through five pairs a day if you have to.

I knew a guy who had awful foot odor. His shoes always stank, and so did his feet. Then I realized, he'd put on socks after he showered in the morning, put on shoes, go about his day, come home, take off the shoes, and leave his socks on. If he went back out, same nasty-ass socks with all that same sweat and bacteria now going back in the same nasty-ass shoes. 

Then I realized A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THIS!!!

Fresh socks every time, people, and when you're not wearing shoes, remove socks. Bleach the white ones. 




 Has anyone used a pet-shipping service they could recommend/trust? 



























































 **THE BEST**

Batgirl started off weak in my opinion but grew on my quickly.

Batman started strong and stayed strong. It's one of the best books DC publishes.

Batman and _________ (formerly "Batman   Robin") instantly had me hooked, but it's gotten weird since Damian died. Batman has been increasingly more and more out-of-character, but I'm holding out hope it leads somewhere.

Batman Incorporated... you love Grant Morrison or you hate him. I'm glad I toughed it out. It's a slow burn, but it's so worth it.

Earth 2 is one title I wanted to hate from the day they announced it. Turns out I love it and highyl anticipate each issue.

Legends of the Dark Knight is one title I was so happy they brought back in its original non-canonical fuck-all form. Yeah, as a collection of stories, it's inconsistent in art and writing, but when it's on, it's on.

**THE MIDDLE**

Batman Beyond Unlimited has actually been mostly good, but I've stopping collecting simply out of disinterest.

Batwing is one I've wanted to quit repeatedly, and I hated the look of the character from the beginning, but there was always something keeping me. Just as I was about to drop the title, they brought in the new Batwing, who looks fucking amazing, and now I'm curious again. Nicely played, DC.

Batwoman isn't going to be for everyone, and I kept getting confused and frustrated, but it rewards patience, and I still believe it's got the best art/panel layouts in the business.

Talon was actually pretty good, and I gave it a few issues, but I couldn't bring myself to give a shit about the character. He seemed like just another Batman knock-off, and there's plenty. Besides, I was amazed by how shitty he looked. They had so many cool variations of the Talons and that's the design they went with?

**THE WORST**

Ame-Comi Girls intrigued me, but I'm jumping off after the Jade issue. It's pretty stupid.

Batman: Li'l Gotham isn't terrible, and it's really cute, but it's not really my thing.

Batman: The Dark Knight started off awful and continues to be awful as of issue 19. I'm been wanting to jump off since the first shitty issue, but I keep hoping it'll get better. It doesn't.

Birds of Prey started shitty and then seemed to challenge itself to get progressively shittier with every issue. They succeeded. None of their teased plot twists were enough to keep me on board.

Catwoman I almost quit repeatedly, but I got re-invested with the JLA storyline. Kitty is on a short leash.

Detective Comics: I have to stop buying this shitty comic just because of its title. It should be the flagship title of DC (Detective Comics), but it's garbage. It's been confusing, muddled, shitty shit since the first issue.

Justice League, like Detective Comics, should be one of DC's star attractions. Instead, it's a monthly clusterfuck. They couldn't even commit to the core roster, like everyone expected, which includes Cyborg, a character so fucking interesting he doesn't even have his own monthly. Thanks for overcharging for the several pages of Justice League and then Shazam's never-ending origin story stapled to the back. Is he ever actually joining the team and/or getting his own title, or is this basically Justice League/Shazam forever?

Justice League of America, the C-list of the Justice League (assuming International was the B-list) has managed to do jack shit in 3 issues, even requiring other titles for back-story and exposition. Another issue or two and I'll decide if it's worth continuing.

Nightwing is a character I love and I still had to drop this title. It started off shitty, got shittier, improved, and then went right back to shitty. I guess I'll never know what happens in Chicago.

Red Hood   The Outlaws is a title I fully expected to love. I... can't... get... into it. I seem to enjoy Jason more when he appears in other books. He'd probably be better solo.

Suicide Squad is a title I started off enjoying and the cliffhangers kept me buying, but a comic can only insult my intelligence so many times before I give it the boot. Sorry slutty Harley Quinn. I liked you better in the jester costume.

Teen Titans is a title I wanted to love since I grew up a fan of the older Titans teams and enjoyed the anime-style cartoon, but what a shit-pile. I kept hoping it'd get better as it got worse and worse. I quit.

 I haven't been here 8 months and I've been too busy to sight-see. We're doing the obvious stuff: tower dinner, Alamo, River Walk, etc., but what are some need-to-see places and must-eat restaurants? I want them to have a good time, and I'd like to at least pretend I'm less of a tourist than they are.

INB4: I know how to use Google. I just figure legit San Antonio natives will know a little better than tourist websites.

Also, I'm aware there's a FAQ. It's extremely incomplete and honestly not that helpful. 




 New in town and I'd like to take my 3-year-old daughter. 







































 I first remember hearing it in the first Transformers movie. I think it was when some scorpion robot came out of the dessert and sent out an EMP or something. 

Any idea where it was used first? 




 I didn't know it applied to male birds in general; I thought it was specific to roosters. 




 Watch all [four of these horrible minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zQ8KpzLPL8) and then ask yourself how much of a masochist you are. 

The only good thing about the Ghost Rider movies was how [incredibly cool/badass Ghost Rider looked.](http://i.imgur.com/i7pzzMc.jpg) 




 [I respectfully disagree](http://i.imgur.com/J7cUEhc.jpg).

Look at that.

*Look* at that.

Some characters they got right the first time. It's a motorcycle badass decked out in chains, leather, metal spikes, and a flaming skull for a head.

You just can't top that. 




 I'm also finding Reddit's attitudes on such things hilarious.

The Pirate Bay is great, KimDotCom is great, copyright law is bullshit, I'll download/torrent/whatever I want, everything should be free.

What? Someone stole my YouTube content and didn't give me credit? This is bullshit! 




 There should be an /r/im14andthisisfunny  




 Try /s next time. 




 cock1

noun

noun: cock; plural noun: cocks

1. a male bird, especially a rooster.

synonyms:	rooster, cockerel, capon

"strutting around like a barnyard cock" 




 Possibly. I just didn't want to force anything into the original theory that I couldn't explain using evidence from the books or movies. 




  audiences want some levity in their superheroes

The ones who religiously watch Marvel movies do. Nolan's trilogy was hugely popular and did ridiculous box office numbers, and although opinions vary, Man of Steel did very well for itself too.

It's okay if Marvel and DC have different approaches; they both have their audience.

I would also expect that some of their movies, like The Flash, will be a little lighter in tone. 




 Oh, wow. You saw all 25 of these movies that haven't been made yet and determined not one of them is good? Amazing. 




 You might be right about Suicide Squad; it has been bringing out a lot of mixed opinions. From what I've seen online, a lot of people have already made up their minds to hate it. 

That's neither here nor there, though. WB isn't counting on Suicide Squad to break box office records; that's what Batman/Superman is for, and *that's* the movie that opens the flood gates for Justice League, Cyborg, The Flash, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, etc.

Suicide Squad can flop all day. It won't be the first or last WB movie to do so. 




 It could be causally mentioned or never brought up at all.

Any thinking audience member will assume they're either step-related or one is adopted.  




  what if Christmas in Whoville is in celebration of Horton saving them? Horton could be their equivalent of a christ figure in our world.

I was actually thinking of going there because there's not even a slight reference to Jesus or anything Christian in the Grinch book or the movies, but the timing wouldn't make sense.

Horton Hears a Who! takes place from May 15th-16th and Christmas in Whoville is definitely in the winter. Assuming their holiday would be on the anniversary of their contact with the outside world, it should be May 16th, late spring. 




 You're confused by adoption and think black people are "edgy."

I don't even know where to begin... 




  50+ years of history

They aren't making a movie with 50 years of history, nor are they relying on the average movie-goer to know 50 years of history. They're making a movie based on a thing. That is all. 




 Guardians of the Galaxy 2: Logically the Same Soundtrack 




 I get the joke, but DC Comics officially changed the character's name to SHAZAM! from Captain Marvel to avoid confusion.

It is kind of wonderful those are coming out back-to-back. I love coincidences like this. 




 In The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, the eponymous character is motivated to end Christmas because he cannot bear the noise made by the Whos in Whoville. Their traditions involve making an incredible amount of noise.

In Horton Hear a Who, we learn that the Whos are tiny people-like creatures living on a dust speck which Horton takes upon himself to protect. When he almost fails and the Whos are threatened with having their whole world boiled in Beezlenut oil, Horton encourages them all to make noise so that they sour kangaroo can hear them and confirm their existence.

Whos associate collective loud noise making with their triumph and survival in their darkest hour.

**EDIT**: This theory is based on the two books referenced and not the four movies (two each) based on the books. 




 You're absolutely right; I've known racists of every race and for a variety of reasons/motivations. 

It's not like white people have some copyright on hate. 




 [It's okay to not like things; just don't be a dick about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0la5DBtOVNI)

And you weren't being a dick about it. 




 Everyone has genres they don't like; no need for excuses. Personally, I can't get into fantasy. If it has elves, goblins, dragons, wizards, etc., you've lost my interest. 




 No one is shitting on your opinions, nor is anyone offended by your taste in books. I'm merely pointing out that run-on sentences by Bradbury are hardly unique in literature and that there are worse offenders. I'd caution you against writing off literature on any such basis. You'd be losing a lot.  




 I'm reasonably sure you've answered the question. Unless anyone intelligently disputes this in the next 12 hours or so, I'll make it as "explained" and move along. Thank you. 




  If you prefer restriction, you are conservative. If you prefer freedom, you are liberal.

So you're saying liberals don't want "restriction" and conservatives don't want "freedom?"

That doesn't sound right. And what do you mean by "restriction?"

___wing refers to your preferred level of government involvement. Right is a lot, left is none.

I'm pretty sure it's the opposite. Right-wingers are the ones always advocating for less government while lefties seem to generally believe in more government programs, or at least better-funded ones. 




 Appreciate it, but you're not actually explaining the difference; you're just saying that there is one. 




 Can you provide examples? I've literally heard Bernie Sanders alone referred to as a Democrat, liberal, left-winger, *and* socialist. Does he just happen to be all four, or could someone be one and not the others or even three but not the fourth? 




 Yeah, I love Billy Tucci in general and this artwork in general, but I'm not getting anything "steampunk" here. 









 It's a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

Chances are, they don't conveniently have humans speaking American dialect English.

What we're seeing is a movie based on something that happened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. An English translation featuring a human cast with puppets and CGI.

 One of the best damned documentaries out there.

Shame the sport isn't a bigger thing. I'd follow the crap out of that. 




 It's not a pun; it's a joke by reversing the meaning of the phrase. 




 Kind of. More like his concerns over nuclear armament led to him thinking the world might not even be around by 2000, so enjoy living while we're here. It didn't suppose that the world would end *in* 2000.

If Reddit isn't for pedantry, what is it for? 




 I think most people would either say "No one *has* eaten yet" or "no one *has been* eaten yet," not "no one *is* eaten." 




 Not every iteration of Batman was going for the level of realism that the Nolan trilogy was, nor did every iteration of Batman have zero knee cartilage and a broken back. In fact, the only other iteration of Batman who had his back broken is the DC Comics version. He's still active because he's also died and come back. Comics don't even try to make sense. 




 Coincidentally the [same top comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/30ldrv/bleeding_through/)

You're not alone. 




 K 




 K. 




 This is the time you're taking due to my pointing out that your comment was similar to someone else's title of this post and I'm the one in need of a life.

K. 




  1) Do you know what the word verbatim means? I get that you said "almost verbatim" but that'd be like if a word or two was different...not nearly every single word. 

Your comment: "Hahha, the poor dummy is holding the bow wr-oh. Well. Shit."

Post title: "Thats not how you hold your b...oh!"

****ALMOST*** verbatim, as in ***NOT*** verbatim, but similar. It's called "hyperbole." You'll find it's fairly common on the internet. You're not being attacked, so lower the defenses. You're not a bad guy, a stupid guy, or whatever else you managed to infer offense from.

2) People have similar thoughts....inconceivable!

Yeah... which is exactly what I pointed out. Brilliant.

3) Also...man, this post is five days old. Your backlog of reddit comment detective work must be growing by the day. 

I can't even figure out what you're trying to say. Yes, this post is five days old. It's the one your comment reminded me of. What "backlog of Reddit comment detective work" of mine is "growing by the day?" What does that even mean?

If this is the worst thing to happen to you today, congratulations on an amazing life. 




 I don't know what that is, but I'll assume you're right considering [this is what Spawn looks like.](http://i.imgur.com/jerB5ag.jpg) Notice the complete lack of similarities to this fish.

 I prefer [*this*](https://gifsound.com/?gifv=gDf8zdX v=Teaft0Kg-Ok s=11) audio. 




 Probably, but stages of development are so incredibly varied that they can be terribly difficult to pin down; "milestones" are horribly misleading. It's entirely possible for a child to be remarkably behind his or her peers in kindergarten and then go on to be top of his or her class just a few years later. There are so many factors and variables, I don't put much stalk in milestones. 




 I enjoyed your rant. 




 *Was*. I believe he's retired from the business. 




  Batman abandoning Gotham

You do remember earlier in the movie the doctor telling him he had no cartilage left in his knees and he had his back broken, right? He passed the torch. 

You can't do what Batman does for long.  




 I agree, one has to assume some pretty extreme narcissism, but that's typical among a lot of artists. Hell, this is the "selfie" generation that posts every minutiae of their lives on social media. If anything, this bloke is reflective of the times.  




 Because Melissa McCarthy needs breakfast too. 




 I remember someone writing a similar comment on a previous time this has been posted and proving that there was some tampering, but considering how many times this has been posted and re-posted, I'll never be able to find it.

 [Ah...](https://youtu.be/GVHPEJoMGsY?t=20s) 




 I'm not understanding your logic.

If climate change is real, largely man-made, and reversible, the opposition funding climate change denial is profit motivated because whatever they're selling--fossil fuels, etc.--is the leading cause of the problem.

The other side--solar panel producers, the makers of windmills, etc.--have a profit motive, which is to sell things that reduce carbon emissions and thereby reduce pollution.

I get *their* motivations, but what sensible person prefers we continue to burn fossil fuels, produce carbon emissions, and continue to pollute at reckless levels? What's the downside to reducing pollution? 




 I agree. I wasn't saying it shouldn't be included; I just feel it's necessary to point out that it's a satire of dystopian novels, not a true dystopian novel in and of itself, i.e., it's not meant to be taken seriously as 1984, Fahrenheit, etc. are. 




 I don't know about most parents, but I personally find Pinky Pie to be the most annoying character on the show.

"Did you learn anything from the anal probing?"

"Yeah. We learned that they didn't like it. I did, though." 




 How? 




 I just ctrl+f'ed to make sure someone did. 




 Truth be told, this is the first gif I've ever made, so it's safe to say I have no idea what I'm doing. I googled it and makeagif.com came up. 




 Makeagif.com gives you five seconds. It was either cut out the bump or cut out the basketball off the dome. I made my choice and I stand by it. 




 There are elements of all three throughout the world to be sure. Huxley got it right in that indoctrination and making the slaves happy to be slaves is the superior way to achieve domination. 

Orwell got it right in that surveillance, control of media, information, history, and ideas through propaganda works.

Bradbury was the one who determined that we'd embrace the oppressor. We'd gleefully surrender our rights and that entertainment would be such a welcome distraction that we'd completely miss the important stuff. 




 I like all those books, but it should be noted that Harrison Bergeron is a satirical sendup of the dystopian novel rather than one purely in and of itself. 




 If you find stock pictures of people and add the text over the pictures in sequence so it reads like a comic strip I can almost guarantee a huge hit. 




 You'd hate Faulkner.

Christ, I could go on all day. These are great authors, not sixth graders turning in an essay on their summer vacations. 




 Besides maybe Animal Farm, The Scarlet Letter, and Huckleberry Finn, I can scarcely imagine an easier book on which to write an essay. 




 To each their own, but I prefer a book with sparse details. I have an imagination; let me use it. I don't need the description of the wallpaper, curtains, or what clutter occupies the coffee table unless any of it is at all relevant to the plot. 




 That's a far better thing than ending not soon enough and leaving you wanting less. 




 You're certainly entitled to your feelings/reactions, but I can't even begin to guess at the sheer wealth of art that you are denying yourself if a man smacking his wife prevents you from even finishing a thing. 




 There is no "be all/end all" of dystopian fiction, but, by all means, contribute other, better works. It adds much more to the conversation than a snarky comment and blanket dismissal of the opinions of roughly 4,823,408 people. 




 Out of Bradbury, Orwell, and Huxley, I'd say Bradbury's vision of the future in Fahrenheit 451 hits much closer to the mark than the others.

He's not a member of the team Suicide Squad/Task Force X, but he does have a least a cameo appearance in the film.

 The news has been covering the dire situation of dwindling bee populations for a while now. Can I be a beekeeper? Is there anything at all I can do to help the bees? 




 I was recently asked to do a Wally West   Bart Allen one, so here that is for anyone curious:

Sure, and The Flash extended family goes even beyond that, but Wally   Bart should be easy enough.

Wally West goes way back to 1959. There was a very powerful trend in DC Comics to give their marque superheroes a child sidekick, and The Flash was no exception, so [Wally West was introduced as "Kid Flash."](http://i.imgur.com/OowRBRA.jpg) 

Barry was dating Iris West at the time and Wally was her nephew. As if the costume isn't unoriginal enough, he got his powers because the exact same accident that gave Barry his powers happened to Wally.

Barry sacrificed himself in the Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1986. Wally gave up the Kid Flash moniker and replaced The Flash, but this was also a way for the editorial staff to nerf the character a bit, as he had become OP as fuck over the years. He could no longer go faster-than-light, but rather the speed of sound and sometimes a bit beyond, much like our CW Barry. 

Wally eventually came across Reverse-Flash (Eobard Thawne) and had to up his game, so OPAF Flash returned because he had to match Eobard's speed. Sometime during the 90s, the concept of "Speed Force" was introduced by Mark Waid, which became the go-to explanation of expanded powers and general fuckery that couldn't otherwise be made sense of. With the variety set of new powers, Speed Force as a way of explaining anything, and the ability to go faster-than-light, it has been argued by some, quite logically, that The Flash is actually more powerful and more OP than Superman.

As of the Flashpoint/New 52 event, Barry Allen is the only Flash to have ever existed in mainstream continuity, but they have shown Wally West in the future. He's now biracial and [sports a new costume.](http://i.imgur.com/WlY1dv4.jpg)

Bart Allen, in pre-Flashpoint 52 continuity, would be the fourth to become The Flash after Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, and Wally West. [He debuted as Impulse in 1994](http://i.imgur.com/DRUfBsS.jpg) and later became Kid Flash. He's a descendant of Barry Allen and Iris West, but is also a Thawne. Just like Wally West was a sidekick "Kid Flash" to Barry Allen, Bart Allen was a sidekick to Wally West.

Bart Allen even got to be the fourth Flash in his own series ever-so-briefly but was [killed off](http://i.imgur.com/M2OT1Io.png) in 2006 only to be brought back as [Kid Flash in 2009](http://i.imgur.com/mtYf3pJ.jpg) thanks to an event called Final Crisis. 

After the continuity reshuffle of Flashpoint and the New 52, he was a time-displaced [Kid Flash](http://i.imgur.com/VwWk678.jpg) with the Teen Titans with some serious amnesia problems.


 

 




 [Jay Garrick was the original Flash.](http://i.imgur.com/M2VD5ug.jpg) He was [cancelled in 1951](http://i.imgur.com/jyzFIvH.jpg) as superhero comics were waning. 

[Barry Allen was a reboot in 1956](http://i.imgur.com/xOzQpVu.jpg), an attempt to revive a classic character. [Jay Garrick existed to Barry Allen as a comic book character.](http://i.imgur.com/9er8eTm.jpg) Eventually, DC thought it would be cool to have the two meet, so to explain this, they were both [The Flash of two different worlds.](http://i.imgur.com/E3JsTF0.jpg) 

Flash forward to 1976, Jay Garrick and other old-timey comic book characters were brought back in the parallel world's answer to the Justice League: [The Justice Society.](http://i.imgur.com/LIYkZWa.jpg)

In 1985, DC Comics had one of the biggest events in comic book history called ***CRISIS*** on Infinite Earths. You'll recall The Flash [disappearing in a ***CRISIS***](http://i.imgur.com/Nii95UB.jpg) in Eobard's newspaper from the future. This event merged all the parallel worlds of DC Comics into one, so Jay Garrick was retconned as having [always existed in the same world as Barry Allen and was in fact his predecessor, the original Flash.](http://i.imgur.com/uQ8Bkbz.jpg)

After an event called Flashpoint where [The Flash goes back in time to save his mother from getting murdered by The Reverse Flash](http://i.imgur.com/kBFQbl8.jpg)  (sound familiar?), DC Comics had itself another reboot establishing the New 52, which, among other things, [merged some of their imprints like Vertigo, WildStorm, Milestone, etc., into mainstream continuity](http://i.imgur.com/2x35VNA.jpg) and just generally messed around with continuity with mixed results. 

Many of DC's "legacy characters" are now featured in "Earth 2," again establishing multiple worlds. [Jay Garrick is The Flash of Earth 2](http://i.imgur.com/4rmSaSu.jpg), just like he was way back in the 60s.

If anyone has anything to add/clarify/correct, please weigh-in. I know I left a lot out, but my goal was an abridged breakdown of the essentials for the uninformed, not a comprehensive guide. 




 The strange thing with all this time travel is the paradoxes it necessarily creates. Eddie killed himself, so Eobard was never born, but he only disappears from existence at the time when Eddie killed himself. If he was never born, he never would have existed at all, meaning he never could have gone back in time to kill Barry's mom, blow up the particle accelerator, etc., and no one would have any memory of him because he'd have never existed.

But what's really fucky for me is that Eobard was from a different timeline than Eddie, so Eddie's sacrifice should have only affected *his* future. As soon as Eobard went back in time and killed Barry's mother, he created a new timeline--one that he was stuck in. I would assume the Eddie of *his* timeline, the one he traveled back in time from, is alive and well.

Remember, they have 100% established that going back in time creates a new timeline. Eobard confirmed that when he commented on Cisco's ability to remember what happened to him in another timeline. 

So... what if Eddie didn't kill Eobard; he just wanted them to believe he had. We know the wormhole came back, but we don't know what triggered it. Perhaps Eobard never needed the time machine; after all, he didn't have one when he traveled back to kill Barry. 




 I sometimes read comments or entire threads dedicated to the fact that Batman not only has Tony Stark style money and resources but has literally been shown to have cybernetic armor suits on par or superior to any Iron Man suit, so why in the hell does he go without? That's usually met with a variety of answers trying to explain something that really doesn't make much sense, but what about magic?

It is an established fact that the DC Universe--possibly all of them--has magic. Unlike the armor, you can't say "it's not his style" because his style has consistently been to master the crap out of everything, know everything, be the best there is at everything. 

Not only would magic be hugely useful in a number of practical ways, but it would also help him with threats like Superman who are vulnerable to magic (we're talking about a guy who keeps Kyptonite in his utility belt). If the JLA encountered a magical threat, they'd have an ace up their sleeve because Bruce studied the dark arts. 

Anybody got an answer for this? 














 My favorite is probably John Steinbeck's "Of Mice   Men."

**EDIT**: You wonderful people have turned this into one of the best collections of single-sitting reading possible, although I'm not sure I can read this entire thread in a single sitting anymore... 



















 There seems to be a sort of conflation of ideas in that they either reflect your personality/skills and come about accordingly, as evidenced by The Cutie Mark Crusaders trying to "earn" theirs. 

They also seem to suggest that they tell you your destiny, as evidenced by that song/episode "What My Cutie Mark is Telling Me" where the Mane Six had theirs swapped.

What I don't get is names. Rainbow Dash, for example, had the words Rainbow and Dash in her name presumably since birth and she grows up to be the one who can pull off a sonic rainboom or whatever? The name "Dash" connotes speed. You could easily write off the rainbow part if the parents didn't name her until she was born and they noticed the color scheme, but unless they were prescient, they couldn't have known her destiny. 

The same is true of Fluttershy. Her name rhymes with her cutie mark--a butterfly--and she's shy. These are details her parents couldn't have possibly known about her when she was born.

I considered that maybe parents don't name their kids until these facts are established, but not only do the Cutie Mark Crusaders have names, but the infant children of the baker parents have names. 

So what's the deal? Are the parents blessed with some sort of precognition when it comes to naming their offspring? How do foals coincidentally end up with names that represent them every bit as well as their eventual cutie marks do? 

















































 My main question concerns Germany and Japan. Did Japan actually treat their POWs the worst? 

[From Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes#Crimes)

According to the findings of the Tokyo Tribunal, the death rate among POWs from Asian countries, held by Japan was 27.1%.[40] The death rate of Chinese POWs was much higher becauseunder a directive ratified on August 5, 1937 by Emperor Hirohitothe constraints of international law on treatment of those prisoners was removed.[41] Only 56 Chinese POWs were released after the surrender of Japan.[42] After March 20, 1943, the Japanese Navy was under orders to execute all prisoners taken at sea.[43] Around 1,536 U.S. civilians were killed or otherwise died of abuse and mistreatment in Japanese internment camps in the Far East; by comparison, 883 U.S. civilians died in German internment camps in Europe.[44]

 Vertigo still counts, right? 














 Choices include: 

	A turning-point battle or campaign

	The part played by generalship or command ability in a given conflict or battle

	The success or failure of a given state or society as it modernized, or attempted to modernize, its way of war

	The impact of a particular technological innovation on strategic thinking or the combat experience

	The role of war in changing socio-economic/racial/gender norms, or the role of socio-economic/racial/gender changes in shaping the composition or character of a given army

	The increased impact of war on civilian populations

	Questions of military ethics and/or war crimes

Then something specific from there. I'm most interested in either a.(The role of war in changing socio-economic/racial/gender norms, or the role of socio-economic/racial/gender changes in shaping the composition or character of a given army) or b.(Questions of military ethics and/or war crimes) but having difficultly narrowing it down to something specific. Any assistance at all would be greatly appreciated.

 I know hindsight is 20/20 and we have the benefit of looking back, but it seems like a clash of at least two of the great powers stacked with new industrial revolution weaponry, mobility, and lethality was inevitable, much less plausible, and yet, it seems it went largely unexpected by the experts. Why?

Why? 



















 My thesis is that building a successful military depends primarily on three factors: motivations of patriotism/nationalism/jingoism, political motivation/will, and of course, the professional expertise to execute plans.

This is as far as democratic/free societies go; of course a dictatorship will simply build military might as they see fit.
 









 I am in New Hampshire. I have a screen capture of the ad where the claim "needs nothing" is made. I contacted the seller and asked him to take the car back for a full refund and he refused. Do I have any legal recourse? Can I sue for false advertising, or is the "needs nothing" claim to vague?

Subscribing doesn't do much for me if 90% I'm just rolling my eyes and muttering "no shit" to myself. 




 The point is, as soon as the animated white-out eyes start moving/expressing motion, they will appear animated, fake, cartoony, and silly. For Deadpool, that will work wonders and fit the character perfectly. For Batman, a more grounded and realistic character in more grounded and realistic movies, it work against the look, feel, and tone of both the character and the movies. 




  Who's to say it has to be goofy and cartoony?

Because that is exactly what is going to happen when you try to apply a cartoon/animated feature to a live action person.

[Picture this](http://media.giphy.com/media/14iEFCXZcJmfXq/giphy.gif) on a real actor. 









 You'd either have white-out eyes that don't move and don't express emotion, which no filmmaker or actor would want, or you'd have animated white out eyes which would be goofy and cartoony. Either way, not appropriate for any remotely serious Batman movie.

Again, Deadpool and Batman are very different animals. 




 It's not an issue of money. Of course Nolan and others have had the budget to white out the eyes; they don't want to for reasons posted throughout this thread, but mostly because the filmmakers want you to see the actor's real eyes. 

Also, because Batman is a more grounded, realistic comic book character compared to Deadpool, they took a more grounded, realistic approach to the look. The white, animated, expressive eyes in the Deadpool movie will look cartoony, and for Deadpool, that's perfect. For Batman, it would be laughable. 

Now I can't stop thinking of Batman: The Animated Series and the [infamous squint.](http://media.giphy.com/media/14iEFCXZcJmfXq/giphy.gif)  




  because they are among the best comic book movies of all-time

As long as we're not including Rises in that phrase, I agree completely. 




 I like both for different reasons. 




 That *was* true, which is why the current comics Batman does (and has for a while now) rocked an all black (actually shades of gray) costume. Inks and paper have improved vastly since. People tend to forget that comics character's [black hair was blue](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114711/3191617-9264010257-bruce.jpg) as well. Is anyone demanding "comics accurate" blue haired Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent?

The Spider-Man villain [Venom was depicted as blue](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/156-VenomSBHImage_1135.jpg) even though he was blatantly referred to as being all black in the comics.  




 That's an in-universe explanation that only appeared in Miller's non-canonical Dark Knight Returns. The truth is that it was that way specifically for trademark reasons. Once they were able to get around that, they restored the oval-less chest emblem. 




 Whole different animal. His white eyes in the comics and in the movies are animated and expressive, part of his cartoon qualities. 




 Too true. Aquaman can swim at 10,000 feet per second. 10,000 feet per second is more than 3 kilometers per second, or 6,800 miles per hour. 

For comparison, Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps can sustain a speed of 4.7 miles per hour. 




 Coupled with invincible plot armor makes him every bit as powerful as Superman.

Popularity is a hell of a power. 




 The Ultimate Nullifier is almost a literal deus ex machina. 




 But *they* didn't give him claws. He was born a mutant with claws. This goes back quite a ways. Even when Magneto ripped the adamantium out of him he had bone claws. 




 That's a really good point. At the time of Justice League's beginning, the concept of creating a superhero team didn't even exist. 




 It's cool you like Superman, but are you going to kick Strawman's ass all day? You're literally arguing with no one. I never said a good writer couldn't write a team of Kyptonians on earth. I never said a good Justice League story couldn't be written with or without Superman, so you're arguing with an imaginary friend.

As for downvotes, I rarely use the button. I'm not the only man on Reddit. 




 The dynamic of their powers works because there's variety; the writing makes the story work.

Do I really have to spell this out? I'm talking about one aspect specifically. Superman's presence on a team is like having God with a team of lesser gods who each get maybe one or two of God's powers. It's redundant. That's the only point I was making. 




 Yes, because I'm pointing out the redundancy of Superman's powers with those of his teammates I must be completely failing to grasp every Justice League story that has ever been written. You nailed it. 




 So I've bounced around working here or there, and I don't know how it is people amass these portfolios. Any work I did for various printers and ad agencies was considered theirs. I didn't get a copy. Should I have? Now I'm looking for work and suddenly everyone asking for a portfolio. I don't have one besides the one I needed to graduate with ten years ago, which doesn't really reflect my talents now. Should I just invent stuff? I feel like I missed a vital lecture/class that everyone else in the industry attended. I feel quite stupid and lost. Any advice? 




  the whole idea of Speedforce is that it's in every univers

In every *DC Universe*, which is already novel considering there are some pretty significant differences between the various universes within the DC universe alone. You don't need to explain that anymore than you'd have to explain there not being a Phoenix Force, Captain Universe, or Power Cosmic in the DC Universe. What's true in one isn't necessarily true in another. 




  Clearly DC and Marvel are in some kind of agreement in that scenario

Yes, and they agree, per DC Comics copyright and interests, that "Speed Force" is a unique property of DC Comics and does not/can not exist in the Marvel Universe, just as the Infinity Gauntlet proved useless to Darkseid in the DC Universe. 




 DC Comics doesn't get to decide what does and doesn't exist in other companies' multiverses. 




 I'm actually sick to death of Batgod. A man who is fallible and isn't the be-all/end-all answer to every conceivable question is a lot more interesting.

I don't even have a problem with "world's greatest detective" and best martial artist in the DCU, but does he have to perfect in every way? It's always either that he knows everything and is the world's leading expert, but in the rare case he isn't, he will be by the time you come back with coffee. 




 That's kind of my problem with Superman and the Justice League. The X-Men work because they're a team with a variety of powers. Yes, some are more powerful than others, but there aren't really much in the way of redundancies. 

Super strength? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (with hard light construct assistance), Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, Cyborg, and the Flash (infinite mass punch anyone?). 

Flight? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter. 

Neigh-invulnerable? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (with hard light construct shielding), Aquaman, Martian Manhunter (more likely density shifts through it, but he's still physically tough), etc.

Super Speed? Superman and The Flash, although Martian Manhunter, Cyborg, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman are able to get to wherever they need to go quickly, including across vast expanses of space.

Justice League *with* Superman just seems kind of redundant. Superman is a one-man superhero team. 




 Yeah, but not in seven or eight months. I'd say there's a good chance of a lot of people seeing this for the first time.

 Okay, but his accepted origin story now across multiple media is that he always had claws, and even before that, the Weapon X program lacing his bones with adamantium isn't the same as saying he has claws due to his healing factor. That doesn't make sense. 




 "Bad Hair Day" from a couple seasons back, season 4 episode 16. He played "Tater."

Tater: I was wondering who was the lucky man who married the beautiful Claire Pritchett.

Phil Dunphy: Luck had nothing to do with it. She saw, she liked, I got her pregnant, had to marry her.  




 I know! I was hoping there'd be some, "Have I met you before? You look so familiar" kind of dialog. 




 I only subscribe to /r/shittyreactiongifs for the titles. It's a given that the gifs are all going to be reposts/x-posts.

 Warren Worthington III has been called both "Angel" and "Archangel," but the name "Angel" has also been used by [Angel Salvadore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Salvadore). She was also featured in X-Men: First Class.

US did the same thing back in the 1930s to stop the dust bowls: "After the howling winds passed and the dust settled, federal foresters planted 100 million trees across the Great Plains, forming a giant windbreak  known as a shelterbelt  that stretched from Texas to Canada."

Actually this project was started first in Algeria in the 70's. It's called the green dam.You can see it in this picture http://imgur.com/E140PYS

They used to take the kids from school from all over the country to plant trees there once a year. Drafted soldiers participated too. The forests exist to this day, I remember finding mushrooms under the trees. You can even spot animals like rabbits there.

EDIT: and it does work and the best economical way to do it is to have the community participate in planting the trees.

But nobody talks about the fact that it hasn't happened or probably never will happen.

They just like to reap that sweet repost karma instead of posting things they actually learned.

Love him or hate him, John cena makes kids wishes come true.

He legitimately cares about those kids.

I was at raw about a year ago, there was a kid there in a wheelchair in the crowd you could tell that he didn't jut break his leg. He was sitting pretty close and John cena threw his shirt, his hat, and I think his wristband things to this kid, everyone could tell it was for him and when someone near him caught it, cena would look at them and motion to pass it to the kid. Everyone did. It was really awesome.

The Foo Fighters wanted to release a cover of Prince's "Darling Nikki" on a b-side, Prince told them that they couldn't due to copyright, so instead they just played it at shows for a while in the early 2000s. In retaliation, Prince played a cover of "Best of You" at the 2006 Super Bowl. However, his revenge didn't work out as planned, as Dave Grohl was stoked to get covered by one of his musical idols.

TL;DR Prince is a pretty reliable copyright dick
 




 What's really amazing is that 50 out of 69 actually found that review helpful... 




  I think the film is cheap and vapid

You've got my attention. How so? 




 I would if it was the word I required, yes.

I'm really not getting all the fuss over my word choice. I never considered "modicum" such a highfalutin bit of vocabulary.  




 Fair enough. 




 Borderline pedantry, but when you're right you're right. Either way, you understand why I'd consider Momento a postmodernist film in that sense. 




 I have read and re-read the post that continuously gets the downvoting and it's far from pretentious. It sounds like you're saying I have to dumb down my comments in order for /r/movies not to have their intelligence insulted, which is actually *more* insulting to their intelligence.

A fellow commenter claimed this movie was postmodern. I disagreed politely and explained my reasoning. If that's something considered a "dick move" by the Reddit masses, so be it. Negative Reddit karma isn't going to keep me up at night.

And I'll keep "modicum." It's a lovely word when it's precisely what I mean. 




 Are there formal and informal versions of /r/movies? If not, what is it about /r/movies that demands exclusively informal speech? How is "modicum" even beyond informal speech? 

You're telling me /r/movies is no place for serious, academic, formal, or even relatively learned discussion about film? Then please, direct me to the subreddit that is, and please do so while remembering that it was not I who brought "postmodern" into the discussion. I'm just the one being crucified over daring to question it. 




 So glad you asked! I think Memento is postmodern in its depiction of life and memories. It supports the postmodern claim that truth is what we believe it to be, and memories are not reliable because we sometimes lie to ourselves, sometimes even unknowingly. The underlying idea is that 'real' truth does not exist. If postmodernism is, at its core, questioning the certainty of things, surely our own minds and the way we lie to ourselves is valid. 




 I aim to please. 




 Postmodernism *is* a vague category; it would be wholly ironic to try and define it with passionate certainty since that is exactly what postmodernism seeks to critique. That being said, I don't see it as a synonym for meta humor or any self-referential or self-aware comedy. That was the crux of my comment. I consider--as I suspect many do--that postmodernism carries deeper meaning than that. 

Obviously I haven't seen "A Deadly Adoption," but I would expect it to be like an hour-plus SNL sketch lampooning the Lifetime movie clich. If that's all it is, would you really categorize it as "postmodern?"

And let's say you would. Fuck me for having a contrary opinion? I have been under the impression that the point of these comments sections was for discussion. If everyone is going to just upvote everyone they agree with and comment the same thing worded differently, what's the point? 




 I'm glad I'm not alone. I've questioned the downvoting of some of my comments and posts, but this one left me truly baffled.

Of course, whenever one is dealing with the written word, there's what you write and then there's what people will read into it. 




 I write as I speak. What's wrong with modicum?  




 [Or zombie strippers.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0960890/) 




 It's a joke that you're taking seriously. 




 I quite like both ;) 




 Explain to me how any of that was the least bit pretentious, rude, or how it could sound "awful." 

*I tend to reserve*

As in me, my opinion. Not saying the other chap is wrong, but here's what works for me. 

I list a number of fantastic films that I consider prime examples of how I interpret postmodernism. What a dick. I mean really, who does that? /r/movies is for discussing movies, not... discussing... movies?

Finally, I simply state the definition of postmodernism from which I am working so that /u/I_AM_LOOKING_AT_YOU and others can understand where I'm coming from, and then I offer another potentially more accurate term for the aforementioned Lifetime movie.

There's nothing "pretentious" about my post. I politely disagreed with someone and explained exactly why. If that's pretentious, you'd have an awfully hard time having any conversation that isn't. 




 You'd think *someone* would have the initiative... 




 For the lazy:

Insofar as I may be heard by anything, which may or may not care what I say, I ask, if it matters, that you be forgiven for anything you may have done or failed to do which requires forgiveness. Conversely, if not forgiveness but something else may be required to ensure any possible benefit for which you may be eligible after the destruction of your body, I ask that this, whatever it may be, be granted or withheld, as the case may be, in such a manner as to insure your receiving said benefit. I ask this in my capacity as your elected intermediary between yourself and that which may not be yourself, but which may have an interest in the matter of your receiving as much as it is possible for you to receive of this thing, and which may in some way be influenced by this ceremony. Amen.

This is taken from *Creatures of Light and Darkness*, a 1969 science fiction novel by Roger Zelazny. 









 Not really; he just didn't remember. 




 That's what I figured. It's funny because I thought of the exact same thing when I saw this post. 




 Disagreeing politely and contributing meaningfully to the conversation = pretentious.

Ah, Reddit... 




 You're not wrong. I'd suggest the loosest definition would be skeptical or critical works of their own time/genre/artform in the wake of modernism. 

 




 Makes a lot more sense than they're all right. 




 Only if said wrestling involves [zombies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UaY4idyLww). 




 I forgot that this is Reddit, where contributing to a conversation with a modicum of intelligence is considered "pretentious."

Next time I'll just comment "this." 




 I don't get Reddit sometimes. All I did was explain why /u/seven3true is correct in that celery can be considered less calories than listed. Why would anyone downvote that?

 Correct.

Kind of.

[Sauce](http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/myth-or-fact-celery-has-negative-calories.html) 




 Yes, but celery has "negative calories." 

As a plant, celery stores its calories throughout its body, just as every other plant does. There are plenty of food calories in celery; the difference is that humans cannot adequately process those calories.

The majority of energy that celery has locked within it passes through our digestive system without being processed. The cellulose calories celery has is irrelevant; all that counts is the six or so food calories we can get from each eight-inch stalk. Since it takes more than six food calories of energy to digest the celery, the net result is that digesting celery does, in fact, exhaust calories. In a very real sense, celery is a "negative calorie" food. 




 Of course. 




 That's not odd; it's logic.

Also, in the introduction of the Wikipedia link you just provided:

 I went to Castaway Cay for my honeymoon. I was very tempted to hide and not get back on the cruise ship. 




 Well, I'm sorry you lost a friend but I'm very happy to read that you and your boyfriend are still going strong. Congratulations. 




 Aw... happy for you and your guy. 




  Well, only because you are just thinking about sex

I'm really not. True, I'm not sexually attracted to men and definitely don't want sex with a man, but more importantly, I don't fall romantically in love with men. I have two or three male friends whom I love, but it's a brotherly love, not a romantic or sexual love. I can't see that working in a relationship, even if he could fix my car for free, which would be amazing...

I like your analogies, though. Definitely laughed out loud at "your balls small funny." 




 That's a fascinating story. So you and your boyfriend (the original) are still together and totally "survived" the experience?

 That would be no different that straight people cheating then. I'm talking about 3, 4, or even more in a loving, committed relationship, kind of like polygamy, but that's almost always one man and like a dozen women, and the women are all for the one guy.  




 I legitimately had a hard time with Ratatouille for that very reason. For some reason, I could easily suspend my disbelief for the talking rat that can cook and whatnot, but controlling a man by his hair? Preposterous! 




 Seriously. The word "misdemeanor" doesn't even appear in the article, probably because it's not a relevant term in this context.

I guess "results in relatively lighter punitive measures" wasn't eye-catching enough.

 I appreciate your civility and lack of defenciveness, but it's more than an opinion; it's an opinion based on quite a lot of research. 




  I believe that exposure to hyper-realistic violence in a controlled enviroment is a practical approach to parenting

Can you read that again and tell me you're actually being serious?

A four-year-old has no ability whatsoever to comprehend what he or she is seeing. Why would you show them at that young and impressionable age where they're still trying to make sense of the world people intentionally and purposefully doing wanton violence to one another? That's the impression you'd want a young child to have of the world? Just dash their innocence against the rocks right off the bat?

As for citing a source, I don't know how to narrow it down from [these 386,000](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=exposure+to+media+violence+children hl=en as_sdt=0 as_vis=1 oi=scholart sa=X ei=wlFsVYzBGMaagwTQtoP4CA ved=0CBwQgQMwAA), but feel free to pick the first three you like and peruse.

Here's a quote from the [first one](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2006-23323-000): Anderson, Gentile, and Buckley describe the reaction of the games industry to scientific findings that exposure to violent video games and other forms of media violence constitutes a significant risk factor for later aggressive and violent behavior.

Here's a more [recent one from 2015](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876285914003325): Child-reported media violence exposure was associated with physical aggression after multivariable adjustment for sociodemographics, family and community violence, and child mental health symptoms (partial correlation coefficients: TV, 0.17; video games, 0.15; music, 0.14). This association was significant and independent for television, video games, and music violence exposure in a model including all 3 media types (partial correlation coefficients: TV, 0.11; video games, 0.09; music, 0.09). There was a significant positive interaction between media time and media violence for video games and music but not for television. Effect sizes for the association of media violence exposure and physical aggression were greater in magnitude than for most of the other examined variables.

Here's another [recent study](http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/03/09/scan.nsv025.abstract): Media violence exposure causes increased aggression and decreased prosocial behavior, suggesting that media violence desensitizes people to the emotional experience of others.

This really shouldn't surprise anybody. 




  The notion that hyper-realistic violence should not be exposed to children is utterly arbitrary

Not according to the many, MANY studies done on the subject, and your anecdote is meaningless; anecdotes are not evidence.

There are hundreds of thousands of studies I could link to supporting what I'm saying: a young child, a four-year-old, should *not* be exposed to the kind of violence depicted in Mortal Kombat.

Like I said, I'll take the downvotes, because fuck me for caring more about the welfare of children than... what? I don't even know why this warrants downvoting. I've been a fan of Mortal Kombat since the original hit arcades in 1992. I was eleven at the time. I've owned the home console version of all of them including X, but I don't play them in front of my now 5-year-old daughter because it would be grossly irresponsible bad parenting. 




  I doubt OP does fatalities/x-rays while his daughter is watching

What are you basing that doubt on? Even if OP doesn't, there's nothing stopping the opponent from doing it.

Besides, this is MK9 we're talking about. The regular gameplay and even backgrounds are graphically violent. 




 I don't care if I get downvoted for this; a four-year-old girl should not be exposed that kind of violence.  




 Great advice. Thank you. 




 As I said in my original post, it's all about convenience. There are currently about 20-30 bottles of delicious water in my refrigerator at about 34 degrees F that I can grab and drink at my leisure. The containers are also convenient, because even if I'm on the go, I can crush them down to almost nothing and screw on the cap. They fit right in my pocket until I can find a proper receptacle. 

So, back to my original point, I use bottled water for the same reason I use floss picks rather than spool floss. Convenience is king. 




 There are lots of reasons including [breakdown on the plastics](http://www.medicine.virginia.edu/clinical/departments/medicine/divisions/digestive-health/clinical-care/nutrition-support-team/nutrition-articles/LeisingArticle.pdf) by reuse and the fact that the bottles turn into [bacteria parties.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12353459) 




 Seriously, people are buying this? 




  the floss picks are the only thing keeping daily flossing convenient enough to actually do

Same rationale I use when buying packs of bottled water. I know I'm supposed to drink water rather than soda, juice, etc., but without the convenience of the bottles and the awesome coldness of the refrigerator, I know I won't. 




 Yeah, as a parent of a five-year-old girl, I would not be comfortable with her seeing this. 




 Which is amazing when you consider how hilariously tame it looks next to something like MKX. 




 I don't even consider it "soft" atheism. Atheism is just a-theism, i.e., without theism. I'm irreligious and I don't believe in god. That's what an atheist actually is, regardless of how many people try to define it on their own terms or make ridiculous line graphs. 

In other words, I'm not making any extraordinary claims. In spite of tons of reading, research, and opening myself up to many ideas, I see no evidence supporting the existence of god, nor do I see the need for one. I stop short of saying there is no god because that's impossible for me or anyone else to say meaningfully. There's no proof either way. 

God either exists and it's wrong to say god doesn't exist, or god doesn't exist and it's impossible to prove a negative. I can't prove pink unicorns that eat rainbows and shit butterflies *don't* exist, but it's perfectly reasonable for me to not believe in them.

Therefore, rationally, "I don't believe in god" is the only sensible statement. 




 Meh. It's not as if I have to re-read it. 




 If every bullshit post were appropriately downvoted, there'd scarcely be a Reddit left. 




 Seriously. I'm 34. I cannot convey to today's teenagers and young adults how outrageous it was to see this in the arcades back in 1992. Minds were absolutely blown. A new ratings system was introduced because of this. People lost all their shit. All of it. 




 Character is unique by being completely black.

"Hey guys! I got a great animal for Noob Saibot! A black panther!"

"Anteater, yo."

"But-"

"Bro. Anteater."

"But he's-"

"Ant... eater."

"Sigh. K." 




 I can't even discuss Transmetropolitan because I start physically shaking with joy. It's that damned good. 




 Warren Ellis is easily one of my favorite comic book writers ever. His run on The Authority was brilliant. 




 I didn't fail to grasp anything. Either is wrong. You're making a statement of fact about something that cannot be proven. It makes no more sense to say God or gods exist than it does to say God or gods don't exist. 

The sensible thing to say is either "I don't believe in god" or "I don't believe in gods." 

It also doesn't matter which one you say as "god," singular, would stand in for any god; it doesn't matter how many there are. 




 Neither is correct. 

Atheists don't believe in god, but in the same way that there is no evidence for god, one cannot disprove a negative. While I certainly don't believe in gods or anything else without proof, I nor anyone else can claim with 100% certainty that an improvable thing doesn't exist. That is logically impossible.

That being said, one should rationally say "I do not believe in god" rather than making any factual statement that they do not exist or cannot exist.

Taking that to OP's point, there is a semantic difference between "I don't believe in god" and "I don't believe in God." The capitalized "God" is a specific one, and, in the United States, most often assumed to mean the Abrahamic God, an even more specifically, the Christian trinity god based on demographics. An lower-case "god" could refer generically to any god, goddess, or similar deity and is therefore a perfectly reasonable substitute. You don't need to pluralize "gods" any more than you'd need to say, "I don't believe in God, god, gods, goddesses, or deities of any kind."  




 We can all read. Your post is 

"There is no God" is incorrect. "There are no gods" is the proper term. 

You're saying one is incorrect and the other is correct.

Not only are you wrong, but you're telling everyone *they're* wrong just because you have an opinion.

You've insulted Rajnikanth. For your sake, I hope he shows you a modicum of mercy. 




 This. They never quantify the number of combatants in the song. Dude could've walked into a room in which 2, 3, 4, or whatever small number of people are fighting in the martial arts style of Kung Fu. 

This isn't rocket surgery. 




 I mean, the man *is* a doctor... 




 Excellent point.  




 Fascinating. 




 "This sub" doesn't hate anything or love anything; its subscribers have a variety of opinions.

I personally hated The Widening Gyre and pretty much anything else Kevin Smith does. That's *my* opinion and probably relatively uncommon to that of most of /r/DCcomics subscribers.

As for Gotham, I never tried so hard to like something and still managed to come up so short. It had its moments, but overall, a huge disappointment. 

As for Endgame, I haven't read it yet. 




 [Harley seems to think so.](http://i.imgur.com/wlqTTNe.jpg) 




 Specifically, Whoville is on a *speck*. Horton puts the speck on a flower. Grinch could take place many years after and the speck has come to rest on a snowflake. The first few pages of Horton establish that, prior to Horton, the speck was just floating around.

If you like Kevin Smith, he's actually written a few comics including for Daredevil and Batman. 




  I always thought of the grinch as a recluse Who who was pushed out of the town by the other who's because of his appearance.

Maybe he is, but it never suggests that in the book.

 I couldn't agree more. I like Batman dark as the night itself. It doesn't make sense to have a bright yellow belt when the idea is to be stealthy. Brown, tan, or even black leather would make plenty of sense. 




 They eat fat? 




 Egregiously so. Has any limit to his power been established? The kid literally alters realities and has even created new ones, wiped people's minds, and traveled between dimensions. What *can't* he do? 




 Mine is left out on the counter by the sink, so definitely don't use that, right? 




  You can also take all of your fats and mix them with sodium or potassium hydroxide (you can get this online) to make soap. 

I'd have a hard time feeling clean after rubbing animal fat all over my body.

 He doesn't grow new ones; they just detach and reattach.

He can use his arm as a blunt weapon and swing it like a club, but aside from a few novelty uses, it's not a very useful power.

  I know where you can begin, reading comprehension courses.

Really? Because here's what you *actually* wrote:

Exactly, making Sue black would have been a lot less confusing. Some people don't seem to get that it has nothing to do with race and everything to do with fucking with the character's for what seems like no other reason than to be "edgy".

making Sue black would have been a lot less confusing

How is making Sue black *less* confusing? The only way her not being black could be construed as confusing is if you didn't grasp the incredibly simple concept of adoption or step siblings. This isn't hard.

fucking with the character's for what seems like no other reason than to be "edgy"

The only "fucking with the characters" (no apostrophe needed there) the filmmaker has done was to make Johnny Storm black, so that's you thinking black = "edgy."

I'm not the one in need of reading comprehension courses. If anyone needs an education here, it's you.

 My theory is going primarily by the books. I didn't know The Grinch shows up in the Horton Hears a Who! movie, nor was I aware of Seussical.

EDIT 1: Which movie version of Horton Hears a Who! did the Grinch appear in? There are two.

EDIT 2: Actually, I have to insist this theory sticks to the books only as there have been two Horton movies and two Grinch movies. The movies contradict themselves and it cannot be sensibly said that one is canon while the other is not. This is strictly a book theory. 




  Jesus was born in the spring, and they moved the celebration day to coincide with the winter solstice

The Gospel of Luke references shepherds grazing their sheep in the fields implying a birth during the springtime, summer or early fall, so yeah, more or less. Your point stands.

 You might need to watch First Blood again; it's brilliant, and the only death is accidental. 




 It works both ways: it's better to live for something than to die for nothing just as it's better to die for something than to live for nothing.

 I'm not arguing a single thing, but lots of citations needed here. 




 I'm appreciating this novel with each reply such as yours. Thank you for this. 




  knowing the context of the book is important

I'm beginning to get that, and that's exactly why I posted to begin with. *This* is why I love /r/books. I get so much more out of reading by having this kind of post-reading discussion. 

It's like being a member of the world's biggest book club without anyone giving me a reading list.

Thank you sincerely for taking the time to write. I really appreciate it. 




  he made me fall in love with Brett

Then I am spectacularly your opposite and this is the kind of thing that makes reading fun. It is so interesting to me that this book had that effect on you and quite the opposite on me. I loathed her. I couldn't understand these foolish men and boys fawning for her. Maybe that's a big part of the reason I didn't get it. I didn't like Brett. 




 In terms of the actual events that transpired, I found the bullfighting descriptions somewhat interesting albeit appalling, but little else of consequence. Their conversations seemed asinine, although I'll give Hemingway tremendous credit for capturing perfectly the way drunk people actually converse. 

I felt constantly wanting for more drama. When Cohn finally threw a punch, I was ecstatic! It felt like the most exciting thing to happen in the course of the novel. Perhaps there's some disconnect between a man of 2015 and values and ideals of a generation a century past. 




 That's a wonderful explanation and I am grateful for it. What perplexed me throughout the novel was what seemed to be a lack of any explicit conflict in need of resolution, but you seem to be saying the conflicts were, in a way, the characters themselves. They all were in pursuit of something and failed at attaining it.

I suppose I didn't connect very well with these characters. I found Brett absolutely awful, Cohn pathetic, Mike an ass, Jake spineless, and Bill... well, I suppose Bill was alright. I didn't understand why Brett was so sought after, why Mike seemed downright amused by Brett's affairs, or at least tolerant of them, or why Jake was so whipped by her that he loved her and yet stood by her as she was drawn to every man like a moth to flame. 

Why *was* Brett so sought after? Was it her title? Was she really that attractive? It seemed every man wanted her and would put up with her. 




 I read this because I recently read and quite liked his Old Man and the Sea. I left it impressed as Hemingway could take such a simple story and have me riveted even though I have no interest in fishing or old men and only a glancing interest in the sea. I read it in a single sitting.

The Sun Also Rises seemed amysmally dull from the start, and I would not have finished it had the author not been Hemingway. I always felt sure it would get better, and when I read the final sentence, it was like a kick in the teeth. Really? That's it? All that for that?

I don't get the title either. I might have titled it "Drunks Repeating Themselves." 




 Yes and no. When they first created their Captain Marvel, they did so in a vacuum. Fawcett couldn't use their Captain Marvel anymore (Billy Batson) because DC sued claiming their Captain Marvel was a knockoff of Superman. Insane as that was, they won. Until Fawcett was bought out by Charlton Comics which was then bought out by DC, Marvel had the one and only Captain Marvel.

Once DC decided to incorporate the old Fawcett/Charlton character into their own lineup, they couldn't release anything with the title "Captain Marvel" because Marvel now owned that publication title, but because the character preexisted and predated Marvel's, they were allowed to keep the character and the name. Hence the series title "Shazam!". 

After skirting this issue for decades with the odd "his name is Captain Marvel; his comic books are Shazam!" scheme, they finally just gave in and officially named him Shazam with the New 52 relaunch. 

As for Marvel's Captain Marvel, Carol Danvers as Captain Marvel has become one of their top properties over the decades and has a movie coming out, which means Marvel's Captain Marvel will be far better known as *the* Captain Marvel to most audiences. Funny enough, the current release date for her movie coincides with the Warner Bros. film "Shazam!". 




 Thunder God by himself should be able to handle all of them at once with the exception of Darkskull, and that's only because Darkskull is half Darkseid. 




 So you're still wrong. As I said, Captain Marvel *has* appeared outside of a DC Comic, Marvel Comics has had numerous Captain Marvels of their own, and DC's Billy Batson has not been known as Captain Marvel since 2011. 




 If you're still talking about SHAZAM! as in Billy Batson, you're still wrong; he was created in Fawcett Comics and was quite prolific there for 33 years before ever being integrated into DC. For a time, Fawcett's Captain Marvel was more popular than DC's Superman. 




 It didn't close either door. You can clearly see the arm of the person inside close the door before the tire gets to it. The same person then opens the other door. 




 This is what happens when I'm involved in too many conversation threads. I apologize. 




 If you want a good discussion on this but don't want to wait for responses, check the threads of the other 52,000 times this quote has been posted on /r/batman. 




  the fans voted for Wolverine, so they had no idea how to have Wolverine win

You're right about that. Lobo was (I don't know anything about [New 52 Lobo](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111135277/4084955-9940480525-lobo_.jpg) and I'd prefer to keep it that way) functionally impossible to kill. Legend has it that Czarnians can only be killed by other Czarnians, and since he killed all the other Czarnians, there is no real threat to him. Heaven and Hell literally won't take him anyway.

Unfortunately, the bar cop-out made it look like they hid a sex scene off panel and Wolverine found the Rogering so satisfying he required a smoke immediately after... the cigar Lobo was smoking. 




 For context, I have to explain that I am a "white" person and that one of my best friends is "black."

I went over to his apartment one time, and when I walked in the door, he was sitting there eating watermelon. I burst out laughing, and he realized what was up, we both had a good laugh.

Another time we were out and I suggested we get something to eat before we move on to another bar. He suggested KFC, which again, provoked a laugh out of me and then him. He punched me in the arm and said something like, "Don't act like you don't love KFC. I was suggesting it because ***YOU*** like it." Which I do. It's a silly stereotype, because most people I know enjoy fried chicken, regardless of race.

None of this is bad, and none of it is racism. At all. This is basically what people these days would call a "meme," a popular thing to reference that goes way back to some sort of basis in reality. 

Truthfully, I don't know why nor do I especially care about how black people came to be associated with things like watermelon or fried chicken, but we all know of the association, and it's not exactly a cruel or insulting stereotype. 

And what possible agenda could it serve? Who benefits from these stereotypes? Who suffers?

No one. So fuck it. Let's just have fun and be cool to one another. It's not hard.

 Yeah, but there's a very negative connotation to the word "prejudice" even though it's really just pre-judging, which is a sensible thing to do in a lot of situations...

We need a word that's for non-racists to have fun with stereotypes, like black people can dance/white people can't dance, white nerd culture versus black gangsta culture, etc. all while keeping a friendly, tongue-in-cheek tone about the whole thing.

 Based on the history of the shield in canon, I would say no, neither Hulk nor Superman could break it or rip it apart. [It has absolutely withstood a direct blow from Hulk more than once,](http://i.newsarama.com/images/i/000/093/888/original/Capt-America-Shield-Block-Hulk.jpg?1364317923) and, as you can imagine, Hulk attacking Cap means Hulk has completely lost his shit.

As for Superman, the only circumstances in which the shield has been broken has been by literal gods or those endowed with all the power of god, and once by a guy who literally controls all matter at a molecular level. All Superman can do is hit it, and the shield just deflects force. Adding more force is useless.

Basically, consider the shield a force multiplier and the multiplier is zero. Hitting with a force of 1 results in 0. Hitting it with a force of 999,999,999,999 results in 0. Anything times zero is zero.  




 Which raises an obvious question...

 I heard there was once a Cable fan who was so dedicated that he actually understood Cable's origin and powers. 

He's now committed to an insane asylum, but good on him. 




 That's also how Youngblood happened; he was working on a reboot of Teen Titans, got canned, and then started Image with a bunch of guys who actually had talent. Instead of scrapping the work he did on Teen Titans he changed some names and presto. He made shitloads of money.

 True, but Captain Krypton was a much different interpretation than Super Soldier. There's really only so much you can do to combine Darkseid and Thanos considering how similar they are to begin with.

Now mixing Darkseid, Thanos, Apocalypse, and Mongul might be interesting.

 *Loved* Dr. Doomsday. 




 Only after Joe Kelly made Deadpool different when he got his own series. Before that, Deadpool was an elite assassin who brandished a sword and had enhanced superhuman abilities with fast healing and a mysterious origin. 

He was Marvel's Deathstroke. The silly Deadpool we know today didn't come until his own self-titled monthly. 




  Green Arrow is a Robin Hood Rip off.

Technically Green Arrow is a Batman rip-off with a Robin Hood gimmick, but all good points. 




  Doom Patrol/X-Men is more debatable because their timelines were close

That actually seems more like evidence that X-Men *did* rip off Doom Patrol than didn't. X-Men came out three months later, which is enough time to see Doom Patrol and copy it.

Superhuman misfits, led by a paraplegic in a wheelchair, dedicated to protecting a world that shuns them, The Doom Patrol debuted in My Greatest Adventures #80 in June 1963, three months before The X-Men #1 with near-identical cover taglines and the names of their arch-enemies with The Doom Patrols The Worlds Strangest Heroes! versus The X-Mens The Strangest Super-Heroes of All! and The Doom Patrols Brotherhood of Evil versus The X-Mens Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.

They're nearly identical. I don't believe in coincidence in general, but certainly not to the degree of a damned near carbon copy just three months after the original. 




 All good points, and let's not forget copying Marvel's mutants with metahumans.  




 TIL 




 Rob Liefeld's entire career is "accidentally" ripping things off. At some point, you begin to doubt the "accidental" part. 




 Or Mr. E. Nygma (Mystery/Enigma) 




 They are: http://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_double_contractions 




 Fanfic. The actual Amalgam was Batman + Wolverine = Dark Claw and Lobo + Howard the Duck = Lobo the Duck. 




 Cautioning parents against creating a horrific fate for their children does not equal hating fat people. 




 Lex needs the suit if he wants to throw down with Superman; [Kingpin ain't afraid to scrap](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2122102-kingpin.jpg), and he damned sure ain't worried about what he's wearing. 




 Well then [here you go.](http://orig14.deviantart.net/eccc/f/2014/191/e/7/amalgam_comic__wolverine_and_lobo__by_alexbadass-d7q5zzr.png) 




 Is Ultimate CA's shield indestructible?

  giving the invincible guy a shield

To be fair, [it's been done](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Clark_Kent_%28Amalgam_Universe%29).

Also, as of the New 52, Superman wears [Kryptonian armor](http://media.comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/super-change.gif).

 Not sure about the original series, but DS9 and Voyager certainly did.

Also, if you rather feel like pretending you're on board, there's always [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPoqNeR3_UA) 




 Like anything it has its ups and downs. I am a fan in general and a big fan of The Next Generation specifically, but keep in mind that this is a highlight video taking the best 15 minutes of Picard's edifying over the totality of 176 episodes and four movies.  




 It's not at all necessary and the tone is so completely different that you might love one while strongly disliking the other. 




 If you really didn't care you wouldn't keep posting.

I think maybe you *do* care.

Just a little. 




 I swear they're the same person on different ends of the diet. 




 No, I don't *like* big-chested Captain America.

I ***LOVE*** [big-chested Captain America](http://loltrap.com/pictures/c32efcb7f667f6c5def39db8eda2e6ce.jpg). 




 But does Deadpool x 0 = Deadpool? 

Because you're going to break math. 




 I knew what you meant ;-) 




 Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?  




 You are a genius. 




 They don't get the respect they deserve. I still wonder how The Incredibles got away with Elastigirl. 




 Lex Fisk or Wilson Luthor. 

He'd basically just be a bigger, stronger, Lex Luthor, which would look just like Wilson Fisk. 




 More like Deadpool was a direct rip-off of Deathstroke that a talentless hack named Rob Liefeld "created" until better, more talented people came along and gave us the Deadpool we all know and love today. 




 Funny that the Batman VS Spider-Man's villains things has already been done (Batman Beyond).

Blight = Green Goblin

Shriek = Shocker

Drek = Kraven

Spellbinder = Mysterio

Inque = Venom 




 Batman actually has a suit that allows him to go toe-to-toe with Darkseid, so I don't think he has any use for Tony Stark's tech, money, or resources. 




 Inertron, Promethium, and Radion come to mind. 




 Seriously, [read this.](http://www.popmatters.com/post/176291-thor-who-its-beta-ray-bill/) 




 Not really. It's not the density of the bullet; it's the force with which it's projected. 

Also, The Hulk has been so ridiculously overpowered in recent years that nothing surprises me anymore. I'd totally expect a story where he's tossed into the sun and he eats his way out. 




 You probably would've gotten it if it had been:

     (Bane's real name) + Venom = Bane

Unfortunately, no one knows Bane's real name... 




 Rob Liefeld never "accidentally" ripped off anything; he just ripped shit off wholesale because he's a talentless hack. 




  And isn't Deadpool supposed to be a ripoff of Deadshot?

Deadpool *is* a rip-off of *Deathstroke*, not Deadshot, and no, he's wasn't "supposed to be." Deadpool was initially "created" by Rob Liefeld, a talentless hack who is notorious for ripping off characters and art. Fabian Nicieza was the first to realize it and he's the one who gave Deadpool his real name "Wade Wilson" as an obvious parody of Slade Wilson. In his early outings, he was a lethal assassin with enhanced abilities and healing with a mysterious past. He was Deathstroke in Spider-Man's costume.

Joe Kelly is probably most responsible for the Deadpool we know and love today. What started off as a total rip-off turned into one of the most original and fun characters in comics. 




 I actually prefer vanilla, but I'm not going to get all upset about it. 




 Eyeball muscles is the best superpower I've heard of since [Arm Fall Off Boy](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/3097751-arm-fall-off_boy-edited.jpg). 




 I always felt like Marvel missed out on "Doctopus." 




 Scarlet Red Spider Hood! 




 It sounds like the device nullifies anti-life though, which would mean it's really a life equation. The double-negative bothers me. 




 I underestimated the potency of 2CE once and that's the only time the kind of psychedelic experiences you see in movies ever happened to me. At first it was the usual abstractions, geometric patterns, animations, but as the intensity turned up, I went out on the balcony to smoke and I watched a tree across the street turn into a fire breathing dragon. When I went back inside everything was way too animated and out-of-control. I decided to go to bed and try to sleep it off, which eventually kind of worked. I had never had a bad trip before and wasn't eager to start.

 




  Don't act like there wasn't any superiority implied with your constant insistence that "well, yeah, maybe but Marvel still does it more"

There wasn't, but you're more than welcome to continue thinking there was.

I said Marvel has ripped off DC more than DC has ripped off Marvel, which is true. I went on to cite examples. Not once did I say or imply either brand is better than the other. That would be akin to saying chocolate is better than vanilla. 




 Anti-Life Gauntlet could've worked though. 




 True, but SHAZAM is a straight up wizardry not to mention a ridiculous powerhouse in his own right. I really think a SHAZAM/Thor hybrid would destroy Superman. 




 I think Bucky/Jason Todd is an even more obvious parallel. 




 You're reading a lot more into what I wrote than what is actually there.

Relax? I couldn't be more relaxed.

Admit that there's more than I think? I'm pretty sure I just did since you were able to think of a few DC rip-offs of Marvel that I didn't.

Stop waving around my big dumb DC-is-better flag? I was never doing that to begin with so I can't very well stop now can I? 

Saying Marvel has ripped-off DC properties numerous times and has done so more than DC has ripped-off Marvel is not the same as saying DC is better, although fantastic arguments as to which brand is better can certainly be made either way. I don't claim one is better; it's a matter of a taste. Personally, I prefer DC.  




 Right, but Deadstroke is new; Thanoseid has already been done. 




 I don't get their reasoning in adding the Ultimate Nullifier. That device is most strongly associated with Galactus and Reed Richards. 

Finding the Anti-Life Equation by itself would make sense to impress Death. 




 A Batman/Spider-Man team-up against Riddler   Mysterio has great potential for exactly those reasons.

Too bad we don't get Marvel/DC crossovers anymore since the buyouts.  




 [It really is.](http://th01.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2014/060/7/e/the_scarlet_speedster_by_robertmacquarrie1-d78ikq1.jpg) 




 [Truly.](http://orig14.deviantart.net/eccc/f/2014/191/e/7/amalgam_comic__wolverine_and_lobo__by_alexbadass-d7q5zzr.png) 




 [Probably.](http://40.media.tumblr.com/c095c474a0f6aa64209f5d125c521917/tumblr_nicsefdDri1r811rmo1_1280.png) 




 Working onomatopoeia into a character name.

I like it. 




 You're right; I thought /u/lovers_acid was asking about something else. 




 In an ideal world, Disney and Warner Bros. would say, "Hey, Marvel VS DC and the subsequent Amalgam Comics was a pretty big deal in the 90s. That was *before* blockbuster summer comic book movies were a thing. Imagine the riches..." 




 [Like this?](http://orig06.deviantart.net/2ed8/f/2009/078/b/6/b61d7b68b5c17f9ff2f62217a106d916.jpg) 




 You mean I'm not the only one who thinks [this](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110710044111/marvel_dc/images/f/f4/Supergirl_Vol_6_1_Textless.jpg) look ridiculous? 




 It was a tough week for Peter Wayne.

Or Bruce Parker.

Thank goodness for Aunt May Pennyworth. 




 You could probably add the modern version of [Despero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despero) as DC's rip-off of its own Mongul which was a rip-off of Marvel's Apocalypse which was a rip off of Marvel's Thanos which was a rip-off of DC's Darkseid. 




 We'll always have [Iron Lantern](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/2169758-iron_lantern.jpg). 




  Hyperion is part of Squadron Supreme/Sinister which is an intentional send-up of the Justice League in response to people accusing the Avengers of ripping off the Justice League.

Which is hilarious on Marvel's part and a perfect response.

In return, DC Comics has "[Earth 8](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Earth-8)" as part of its 52 world multiverse, which is a blatant [Marvel parody](http://www.dccomics.com/characters/earth-8). 




 What's wrong with Flulk?

You wouldn't like Barry Banner when he's angry.

Or Bruce Allen.  




 [The Amalgam Universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalgam_Comics), the result of [Marvel VS DC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_vs._Marvel). 




 Under Warner Bros and Disney ownership, I doubt we'll ever see anything like that ever again. 

It was cool coming of age in the 90s... 




 Some of these are pretty good, but some are way off.

Swamp Thing   Man Thing debuted within weeks of each other and there's no possible way one creator could have been aware of the other's creation. Call it a cosmic coincidence.

Black Mask is nothing like Red Skull. For one, he wears a mask as opposed to Red Skull being a deformed freak. The first word that comes to mind when I see "Red Skull" is "Nazi." The first word that comes to mind when I see Black Mask is "gangster." Red Skull is basically Hitler whereas Black Mask is basically Al Capone. Red Skull does things as lofty as attempting world domination and even cosmic conquest. Black Mask concerns himself with organized crime in Gotham City.

I get the Blackest Night/Marvel Zombies comparison, but they're really quite different. For one, MZ was an out-of-mainstream continuity story and everyone was zombies. Blackest Night was in-canon, did a lot to further expand the Green Lantern mythos, created a top villain out of a forgotten B-side villain, and the only "zombies" were already deceased DC Comics characters.

The Jason Todd/Red Hood   Buck/Winter Soldier thing is superb. 




 Might as well say The Flash + The Hulk = God. There'd be little practical difference. 




 Moon Knight + Midnighter = Moonighter?

 




 I always thought Batman and Moon Knight were the most obvious mashups, but they combined Moon Knight with Nightwing to make [Moonwing](http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/moonwing1.jpg). 




 [It's been done.](http://amalgamfanon.wikia.com/wiki/Iron_Bat) 




 Fixed it; thank you. 




 A bit on-the-nose, but yeah. 




 Yes, but that's not a comic book company ripping off their only true rival. Also, DC's Batman and Superman both had a number of inspirations, neither was a direct rip-off of anything else. That's patently different than two major companies existing as direct competition to one another and one far more often than the other ripping off its rival and doing so blatantly.

Bumblebee is really the only DC Comics character that I've noticed who was just outrageously obvious a rip-off of a Marvel one. 




 The Creeper has been around since the 60s. I last saw him in an issue of Katana within the past year or so. 




 Right, but Thanoseid already exists as part of Amalgam; Deadstoke didn't. 




  Pow Wow Boom Boom Smith

By far my favorite name to come out of the whole event.

Also, I absolutely loved the way [Magneto](http://i.imgur.com/Q7kZaSU.jpg) looked.   




 True, but Thanoseid is a thing and Deadstroke isn't. 




 Yeah, just in the Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel styles. 




 Yeah, but you can't blame Marvel   DC for combining their two best-selling characters at the time (Wolverine + Batman = Dark Claw). 

Plus, combining The Creeper and Nightcrawler made visual sense. Still, Wolverine   Creeper's powers are fairly similar and they do have a nice visual complement.  




 I didn't, but when you say this:

 I am positive I could identify a counter example to each one listed, thus showing that it is much more even.

and then don't, that's pretty weak.

You're basically saying, "I can totally prove you wrong, but I don't feel like it." 




 He could positively wreck Superman. Thor is already on threat level to Supes, but add magic? Might as well give him a pocket full of Kyptonite while you're at it. 




 [Steel.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_%28John_Henry_Irons%29) 




 Party, yes. Clark Kent is based on Harold Lloyd and his name comes from Clark Gable and Kent Taylor. Inspiration for Superman was drawn by stories of Samson and Hercules, Flash Gordon, Philip Wylie's novel "Gladiator," and Doc Savage. Metropolis is so-called because of the classic Fritz Lang science fiction film. 

Funny you mention the "Biblical" aspects; Superman is an easy parallel to Moses as well. 




 [Here.](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Thanoseid_%28Amalgam_Universe%29) 




 Yes, [everything is a remix](http://everythingisaremix.info/), but I disagree that it's pointless to debate. Actually, it's downright interesting in many cases. If anyone really cares about a character, it's worth noting what inspired said character, rip-off or not. 




 To fair, Amalgam had some terrible names too.

Skulk

Winterstick

Abominite

Two-Faced Goblin

Bizarnage

Shatterstarfire

Ra's-A-Pocalypse

Aurora Trigger

M-Parasiteplate

Northstar Trigger

Pow Wow Boom Boom Smith

Shaggynaut

Thunderchick

Fin Fang Flame

Medusa Moonrider

Ultivac the Multi-Robot

Mandarinestro

Chemodam

Paste-Eater Pete

Scavulture

 




 I have the entire collection. 




 And they say Superman is overpowered... 




 True, but Deadpool looks kind of cool with a half-mask and pirate boots. 




 [Link](http://www.amalgam.wikia.com/wiki/Super-Soldier) for the lazy. 




 I'm not Eric Guzman, but it's funny you bring up Apocalypse because Apocalypse is a rip-off of Thanos is a rip-off of Darkseid. To get even weirder, DC ripped off Thanos, a rip-off of their own Darkseid, to create Mongul.  




 Yes and kinda. 




 No argument here. 




 Because [Thanoseid](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Thanoseid_%28Amalgam_Universe%29) is already a thing and because [Thanos is a rip-off of Darkseid](http://comicsalliance.com/knockoff-characters-comics/), hence the similarities.  




 True, but if you go all the way back to DC's earliest stuff, they weren't ripping off Marvel of course, but Batman and Superman both take their inspirations and some vital characteristics from other works of fiction.

For example, the original Batman was a mix of Sherlock Holmes, Zorro, a Leonardo da Vinci sketch of a bat-winged flying machine, The Shadow, and even a pulp fiction serial called The Bat. 




 No problem. If anyone knows of any other times it has been broken, feel free to correct me, but I'm pretty sure that's it. Marvel has been pretty good about sticking to "the shield is indestructible" canon. 




 [Yes I have and it was one of the happiest comic book moments I've ever had.](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113883/2164436-deadpool_vs_deathstroke.jpg) 




 1. I've been following both brands for three decades and I can think of way more examples of Marvel ripping off DC than the other way around, as I've shown.

2. Please do.

3. Exactly right. For example, although Deadpool *was* a blatant rip-off of Deathstroke when Rob Liefeld introduced the character, Slade and Wade are nothing alike and the characters have much less in common now than they did then. Plus, things like The Avengers being a rip-off of the Justice League are fairly superficial. Whether DC thought to combine a bunch of their A-list heroes or not, someone would have thought to eventually. 




 Now we just need to combine Riddler and Kingpin...

...oh, yeah.

[The Big Question.](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Edward_Fisk_%28Amalgam_Universe%29) 




 You're not wrong, but more often-than-not, it's more fair to say Marvel rips off DC.

Deathstroke - Deadpool

Green Arrow - Hawkeye

Darkseid - Thanos

The Penguin - The Owl

Suicide Squad/Checkmate/Secret Six - Thunderbolts

Deadshot - Bullseye

Green Lantern Corps - Nova Corp

Doom Patrol - X-Men

Catwoman - Black Cat

Superman - Gladiator/Hyperion/The Sentry

Justice League - Avengers

That being said, DC ripped off Wasp with Bumblebee and Namor with Aquaman. There's probably others, but Marvel is much more thieving of DC than the other way around. 




 Being that [Deadpool was originally a Rob Liefeld rip off of Deathstroke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool#1990s), the similarities are already blatant.

Nicieza contacted Liefeld, saying "this is Deathstroke from Teen Titans." Nicieza gave Deadpool the real name of "Wade Wilson" as an inside-joke to being "related" to "Slade Wilson," Deathstroke. 




 [Can't unsee.](http://www.timetravelcostumes.com/images/sci-fi-monarch-henchamn/monarch00.jpg) 




  They are too similar.

[Because Thanos is literally Marvel's rip off of Darkseid.](http://comicsalliance.com/knockoff-characters-comics/) 




 [It's been done.](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Thanoseid_%28Amalgam_Universe%29) 




 [Thanoseid has been done.](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Thanoseid_%28Amalgam_Universe%29) 




 Captain America's shield is physically indestructible under normal conditions; while cosmic and godly opponents have broken the shield, the shield proves strong enough to absorb Hulk's strength, and repel an attack from Thor's mystical hammer Mjlnir without any visible damage.

It has only been destroyed a few times. 

1. Molecule mean destroyed it, but reassembled it. He has absolute control of all matter, so that's a special exception. 

2. Dr. Doom broke it, but he had the Beyonder's powers at the time, so he was basically a god-like being with limitless power. The Beyonder proper reassembled it like new. 

3. Thanos, already possessing godlike power, was able to shatter it with the Infinity Gauntlet, which is again unlimited power. Nebula fixed it when she used the Gauntlet to undo everything Thanos did.

4. Thor has broken it twice, but required Odinforce the first time and Rune Magic the second time. The first time he fixed it, the second time that particular timeline was undone, so it's like it never happened.

5. Serpent, the Asgardian god of fear and Odin's brother broke it with his bare hands, but he's basically god. It was repaired magically and even stronger now.

So basically, you need omnipotent power and/or magic to destroy it. Due to the enhancements since the last time it was broken, magic is probably useless. Unless you have all the power of god, you can't break it.
