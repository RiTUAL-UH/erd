 It depends on your diet but if you're on a ketogenic diet,  I find that hunger is not a huge issue. 

The ketogenic diet trades out your dependency on carbs and forces your body to use fats for energy.  I eat foods high in fat and stay away from carbs. I find that hunger strikes less often and I can go longer between meals.

 Did OP just watch human centipede recently? Or more shocking, OP is researching to see if s/he can make a human centipede. 




 I assume you're talking about your computer not WIRELESSLY connecting to your router. I'm going to state the obvious, but have you checked to see that you didn't accidentally turn off the WiFi on your laptop? 

If that's not the case then I suggest connecting the computer directly to your router using the LAN cable (in order to access the internet) and downloading the wireless driver from the hp website and try reinstalling it.

 Communication is key. I just come to an agreement that works for both parties. It's nice to talk to each other sometimes. 




 When I was old enough to realize that the teachings I was receiving in bible class were hard to believe. Upon questioning them I was only given circular arguments which basically boiled down to, "we are adults and we know more than you, so listen to us."

In my middle school years I learned more about history. I learned about how past civilizations had gods for things in nature that they didn't understand and couldn't explain (Roman god of the sun, etc.) We look back on it now and think they were silly for having a god if the sun or god of the sea, yet we (organized religion) have a god that created the universe, since we can't explain that (yet).

 




 Well, anything that breaks the ice, leading to conversation is always a good start.

 The article states that he was not in the same town at the time she claimed the rape occurred. She blatantly told a lie.  




 If it's already been proven that he is not guilty then why isn't the accuser instantly punished? You get punished for falsely screaming "fire" in a crowded building.

 Neelix doesn't look like he enjoys performing as a DJ and his style of music is very progressive. It's great for listening to at a desk but at a festival it's boring, for lack of a better word 




 It really depends on the crowd and what he "thinks" the crowd is receptive to. I was at a private show he did in Hollywood last weekend and he stated that he was playing a Perfecto Dark set but the crowd was a bunch of hipsters who barely even knew who he was. 

Only about 3 tracks in, he started to progressively get more mainstream with a more "pop" sound. The last song, all the hipsters jumped up and sang along to. I had no idea what song it was. So as a DJ he completed his job to get the party going, but I can't say I enjoyed his set much.

TL;DR He will play what the crowd is receptive to, whether it be pop or more underground. 




 You might try looking into minimal techno or minimal trance. Although when you mention "slow, darker" trance in your title, I'm inclined to think progressive psytrance, but that's just me haha

 If you're at a psytrance party, then the people who came want to listen to psytrance. I hate it when they put artists who play radically different styles back to back at a festival. It really breaks up the musical flow of the night.

 3d movies are a gimmick to try and give movie theaters a competitive advantage over in home theaters, but the theaters and movie studios are fighting a losing battle. 

I prefer to watch movies at home and my TV is plenty big. I'm sure there are many others who share my same preference. The draw of 3d and big screen is not enough for me to pay $15 to $20 bucks for a theater ticket.  




 I think it's because watching movies in theaters is a dying trend. Most people will torrent the movie or just wait until it comes out in digital format.

 Does it really matter who you find attractive? You shouldn't let other people's opinions determine your actions. What you find attractive about a person is so subjective that anyone else who judges has no validity.

Interracial couples are great because each person gets to experience, learn and adopt a part of another culture. They get to share traditions and food. It's a positive for all since each person becomes more cultured by the experience.

 Getting shot in the shoulder is not just a flesh wound that you can shrug off. Your mobility in that arm would be severely limited.

 Gonna make like a used tampon and get up out this bitch. 




 It does.  




 Because the clitoris is so sensitive, Brandon says, she sees women being more specific about their preferences for how they want to be touched. "[Men] rarely tell me, 'She touches too hard, too soft, she tickles, her hands are cold.' Women say those things all the time about how men touch their vulvas, clitorises included. Women are finicky, and so are their clitorises." 

Men rarely say anything to women because they're either too shy or too awkward to voice their concerns or they think criticizing the way a womam touches their penis will discourage further handjobs.

Well, I'll do a service for most men by saying: Most women's handjob technique is horrible! Guys, speak up and tell your women how to properly give handjobs.

 Let's say you borrow 100k and end up not paying for it. The company that you borrowed money from would rather get some money than no money, so they sell your 100k debt to a collection agency for 10k. 

Now the collection agency "owns" your debt of 100k and can come after you for that amount. Since they only paid 10k for your 100k worth of debt, they may try to offer you a "deal" by saying they will settle with you for 50k. 

If you end up paying the 50k, you think you have a good deal and the collection company makes away with a cool 40k profit. 

This is how many private loans and credit cards work.

 Are you 5 years old?  




 I know it probably sucks right now but you have to look at this in perspective with your whole life. You sound like a young guy so you should have many years ahead of you. This event in your life is rather small compared to your whole life. 

Learn from this and grow from this. They're not worth your trouble being bitter over this. Think about what you gained: the knowledge that life does go on after a "serious" relationship. You got rid of 2 shitty people in your life. 

Chin up man.  You'll be okay.  




 It's very difficult to "force" genres on anybody. Especially when it's something as subjective as music.

You should try to stay true to music you enjoy or you'll find that you get bored very quickly. 

Try building your own following and then try finding some underground promo groups that like dnb. 




 Hmm, I know exactly what you mean by being cliquey. You just have to put in time and get to know them without actively trying to get a gig with them. Build the relationship first before trying to ask for a gig. It's also difficult if they don't like the genre you play. You might as well go another route if that's the case. 

About the cd thing. I find it more effective than telling people to visit your SoundCloud  (or whatever). Because let's face it, how many times have you met a dj that you liked and then remembered to visit there page the next day? Now imagine a dj you don't know asking you to visit their page. You'd probably politely say yes, but never comply. If you hand them a cd with your info on it, they might actually listen to it. 




 I make the same observations as you. I know a lot of mediocre djs who shamelessly promote themselves online and have managed to garner a decent following. I say shamelessly because their mixes range from awful to decidedly mediocre, yet their audience does not seem to mind, and neither do they. Maybe the audience is not knowledgeable enough to discern the mistakes?

Out of respect for myself and the art of djing, I hesitate to release mixes that contain amateurish mistakes such as trainwrecks, extended periods of off-key mixing,  or uneven eq-ing of tracks.

I'm not any way hating on them. We all have to start somewhere. I like to think that they don't know they are bad because they are ignorant to what "good" is. They don't even know that they don't know. 

I think if your goal is to dj to a larger crowd then you have to market yourself. Create an online presence, network with other djs and promoters, attend club events and mingle with the crowd, pass out demo cds. If you are as good as you say you are, naturally you will gain a following because you are offering a superior product compared to the other (worse) djs.

 Just curious as to what equipment you've been using to mix or practice on that you don't know how to to set up your laptop.

Just a word of warning, set up a time before your gig so you can hook up all your equipment and make sure it works. A few days before the gig if possible, sinceb it sounds like you don't even have all the equipment you think you need. 

I'd also have a back up plan, like having a bunch of tracks prepped on a USB drive in case you can't hook up your laptop. I'd suggest setting them up in rekordbox if you're using CDJ's.

 People who work there are empowered to take care of the customer as they deem fit. It won't hurt the bottom line much if you realize just how many drinks get thrown out in a day.

Gender roles, the belief (or lack of belief) in a god, ethics, food, long term life goals (like what/where you want to end up so that you'll feel happy), and family goals (like when/if you want marriage and kids). These are some heavy subjects but eventually you'll  want to discuss them. 




 I hate it when unexperienced guys sleep with virgins. They're always too eager and don't know how painful it can be. This is why I try to avoid virgins. 




 Meow meow meow 




 A+++++ would read again!!! 




 I sucked a dick for $20 bucks.  I'm not gay, but $20 bucks is $20 bucks.

 LA has underground trance and psytrance parties. 




 Some ways I've seen people tip:

* $1 per drink, regardless of price or effort.

* $1 per drink for drinks that only require pouring (ex. beer, a shot, a glass of wine, etc.)

* $1 per drink, and will increase with difficulty/complexity of drink being made. (Usually an arbitrary amount decided by the patron).

* Percentage of total (usually 20%).

**Bartenders:** How much do you expect to be tipped? What is the amount of tip that can be left, where you will still feel stiffed, even though a tip was left? Do you ever feel that, due to slow service or messing up an order, you deserved a lower than normal tip?

**Bar patrons:** How much do you tip your bartender and what is your reasoning behind it? 




 Cumming so hard that your spinal cord snaps and you lose consciousness while laying in a pool of your own liquid.  




 Some lives you kill more people.  
























 So is spelling. 




 Or give it a Coca-Cola. 




 May the fourth be with you. 




 Shh, patience... 




 especially after having to deal with shitty Apple products on a daily basis for several years

You know, you do have a choice to buy other phones right? 




 An innuendo would not be one if you didn't understand it.  So therefore the thought was already in your head.  All he did was make you consciously aware.  




 It's never bothered me. I've earned my red wings more than once.  




 Actually you can.  I'm at work so I'm not going to search for it but maybe someone will chime in.  




 Huntington Beach? 

Edit: thanks for the gold.  




 I expected this. 




 Good job, but the funny thing about real life is, your GPA doesn't mean shit in a few years. 




 It was the juice cleanse that dealt the final blow. 




 Hey, you've already done all the hard work so whatever intern picks up your story will look like they are smart and did some work. 




 The pictures are eerily similar to how the 4th dimension was depicted in the film Interstellar. Which would be accurate since space (x,y,z axes) is 3 dimensions and time being the 4th. 




 I used to try and butcher people's names as much as possible because I knew it would give them something to instagram about,  so that they can feel that the people following them online really give a shit about anything they have to post about.

 I'm going to, er, "confer" with my gf and check back tomorrow. For science!  




 You should taste it and see!  




 Sorry, I should have, expanded on that. (I don't think I've been on Reddit that long) 




 You lie!  




 What the hell is that?

 When will they learn? No texting and flying! Damn kids! 




 Hey Jim, I love your character in The Big Bang Theory. Can you tell us how it's like to work with a hottie like Kaley Couco?  




 Or fearing that her parents might pick up the line while you're having a phone sex session. 


3 way ftw! 




 You compare the act of running a red light to the crime of shooting someone.

Does running a red light constitute a crime? Is it an immoral act? 




 Oooooo, I got this reference. Although I don't remember from where.  




 Awesome! This is great for road trips since you can stream from Spotify.  




 I have an office job so I listen to tracks at work. 




 If you can't discover new music on Spotify, there must be something wrong with you. 

There are tons of playlists to explore.  




 Some of the top earners make in the millions.  




 That was his cell phone.  




 Aw, I hate it when that happens.  




 I'm more shocked that the most expensive thing on the menu is under $5 US dollars.

 Whoosh! 




 TIL I am a Greek god. 




 That's a lot of sunshine.  




 I live in California,  so yeah.  




 Well you better start getting active on the social media pages then. Go to the event page on Facebook and post on the wall that you have tickets for tomorrow's show. 




 Or just eat varied food that is cheaper than ramen. It's not impossible to develop a diet for yourself that is cheaper than ramen, just requires a little bit of effort.

You talk a big game, but I seriously doubt you can put your money where your mouth is. 

 




 You've been djing for 5 years and you don't have enough of a following (or a group of friends) to which you can sell 20 tickets?  




 I got a pocket, got a pocket full of sunshine. 




 Oy vey 





























 At a rave in southern California called Escape from Wonderland in 2014. 




 Armin would be fantastic because of all the other djs you would meet. I'm not so sure I would want to listen to every one of his sets though. Haha 




 You probably wouldn't play many shows then, since he doesn't really like spinning that much. 




 PvD was drunk off his ass the last time I saw him. His mixing was horrible and only topped by his, even worse, track selection. A huge disrespect to the thousands of fans he is PAID to perform for. 




 Art is so subjective 




 Crack head crimes 




 If you knew anything about making fresh pasta, you would know that you cannot make it "al dente." Fresh pasta should have a slight chewiness to it.

Al dente is not even an Italian "thing."  




 I would disagree. Yes, the questions are topical but what John says very much reflects my sentiments. 

People should embrace change and advances in technology. It applies for everything else in the world, and so too for the dj world. 




 You just typed a transcript of my entire sexual career. 




 [Here's one I recorded over the weekend. Tracks from Lostly, Indecent Noise, John Askew,   Liam Melly] (https://youtu.be/xBBf9xeiFqY)

Let me know if it sucks.

  




 I'd say 25-28% 




 Manual transmissions are usually $1-2k cheaper on most vehicles. I don't know what you're talking about. 




 Why the hell would your pubes be that long?  




 Here here! 




 Its actually relatively easy to do it yourself. Go into any Auto zone and they sell a oil change "deal" that includes all the things you need including an air filter for a reasonable price. All you really need is a screwdriver and to get your hands a little dirty, but an oil change is super easy.


Air filter?  Screw driver?  

Last time I checked,  you don't need an air filter for an oil change.  Maybe you meant oil filter?

 Instructions unclear. Drank gasoline. 




 Driver picks the music. That's like rule #1 dude. 




 I had to pay late fees =( 




 That's expensive. Isn't a 36 pack of Budweiser about $25 bucks?  




 Yeah, what gives? 




 But he never has to pay a toll again because, you know...he's dead. 




 "Cute pussy gets licked and then eaten." 




 I never said people don't make typos. It's the people who are too lazy to correct typos that irk me. 




 

Personally I wouldn't engage in some pissing match that accomplishes nothing over the spelling of a trivial word that doesn't matter. But that's me.

But yet you have responded twice. 




 Doesn't Ruby Skye in SF book good trance artists? 




 Unless it's digital  




 WHAT IF I am the face palm, for not turning off notifications?

Cue Keanu meme.

No, but seriously, I did turn off notifications afterwards. It's annoying that the default of the app is to bomb you with notifications. 




 So you don't think attention to detail is important?

Do you think it's okay to make small, preventable mistakes? It would seem like it from your attempts to rationalize the whole thing. 




 A massive wall of notifications from the redfin app 




 /r/djs is definitely the sub for beginner djs and all around noobs! Or at least that's what one would deduce from most of the threads posted here.  




 I give a shit about spelling because it reflects on a person's character. Someone who can't be bothered to use the correct pronoun contraction not only shows their lack of education, but it shows they lack the attention to detail required to function at a high level.

Sometimes a mistake is a mistake, but why let a simple spelling or grammar error undermine your whole argument? 









 I'm more upset that no one seems to know how to use this meme. This is "malicious advice mallard" aka a duck that gives bad advice. It's NOT an angry duck. 

Make the distinction people!

Excuse me!? 




 I haven't looked at the pictures or thread (at work), but how does looking at pictures equate to cheating? 




 Everyone wants to fuck everyone, but nobody wants to admit it. 




 I was hoping you would understand the question is a rhetorical one, given the context and the forum in which it is posted. 









 For the price, you can get much better sounding headphones.

 




 You sound a bit salty. Are you ok? 









 I meow all the time. 




 All these people telling you that you NEED to go to college don't know what they're talking about.

You have the job now, it pays well, stay with it since it makes more sense financially. You always have the option to go to college later on.

Not having a degree won't impact your hireability (is that a word?) since you'll have your work experience to back you up.

To paraphrase a friend. 
   You may be a college graduate applying for the entry level manager position, but the guy that dropped out of high school to work for the company, applying for the same position, has 6 years experience on you and he already works there.  




 "How to fall asleep in under a minute."

You mean chloroform? Only down side is that you wake up with a really dry mouth. And occasionally it makes your buthole really sore. 




 When I was 10, I dated 12 year olds. Booyah 




 Google keyboard's text prediction is horrendous. It always corrects to stupid ass words I never even try to type. And the actual word I'm trying to type never even appears on the suggestion box. 




 Somebody's been watching too much food network. 




 A urologist perhaps?  




 So do I.

 I think your estimate is off if you are truly walking around on your whole shift. When I used to be a nurse, I'd walk something like 14 miles in a shift. 




 I can't tell you anything about it because I don't even know that I don't know about it. 




 Proof? 




 Who knows, she might be into golden showers.  




 Gin   tonic with a lime wedge is nice. Beware though, tonic still contains sugar. You can opt for sugar free if you're being extra strict. 




 It's from being dehydrated. Keto already requires a higher intake of water as it is. Keeping your electrolyte balance is crucial. I take potassium supplements. 




 I like you.

 Gossiping coworkers. 




 No, you're doing it wrong. The fact that you down vote him means that you acknowledge that you're a fag. 




 You know what they say about people with big pockets
