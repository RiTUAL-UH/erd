 Hawaii and Arizona do not follow daylight-savings time because they recognize that it is a fraud, and a clear and present danger to the spacetime continuum.

 Hi Arthur.

 I love how this subreddit is evenly distributed among the sarcastic and the jingoist with basically no dividing line.

This is the one subreddit that I'm pretty sure would result in a massive brawl if it met up physically. 




 Biggest problem with amplified in my opinion is that you can't really mine for any useful minerals above the normal elevations. Iron should be spawning well above sea level regularly and it doesn't. You still end up having to go all the way down to the bottom to get any good mining operations going so it kind of kills the high in the sky vibe for me. 




 I've found witch huts in amplified on 13w38a, b, and c, but it came with the realization that swamps are fairly unimpressive in amplified. I want some spires with long vines or something.

 South of the Mason-Dixon Line.  Oop.

 I love all the stone in the bathroom. 




 I mean, he's right, I am, but I was just being facetious. 




 In your defense, I am American; I was joking though.
I wouldnae stopped by if I didn't think it was a pretty sweet looking house. 




 Tiger on a gold leash you say?

 Looks like he spent a lot of time in the hot equatorial sun being stressed out, to me. 




 Yeah if the ramp truck would contact the ground that'd be so sweet 




 (The point where a planet isnt to close to its star where temperatures soar over 300 degrees! And where the planet isnt to far away where everything freezes. The conditions are perfect! Earth is also orbiting in the Goldilocks zone). 


its*, too*, too*

Does Buzzfeed proof anything that they post?

 Came here to assure that the 101's got covered. Thanks. 




 The front fell off. 




 Pansy!

 I agree. This is a run of the mill Hooptie. As an Atlantan I am neither phased nor disappointed proper by this vehicle. I like the posts about ugly wings and mismatched bodykits or aggrandized Geo Metro's and misapproriated high-dollar decal work.

But yeah. 




 //Cue tomato throwing at Dubai's falsity of being// 









 Ahhhh good call.

 Been playing around with the Heavy Dump Industrial mining truck and I find it ridiculous that you can destroy a 35 ton truck by running over a compact car.

There's no way it should explode from that interaction. Pop the tires? Sure.
Anyone else think that's absurd?
