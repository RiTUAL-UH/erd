 It was more or less improvised. But not that complicated at all: cook the sushi rice (add some sugar, rice vinegar, salt) and let it chill.
Meanwhile cut all the other ingredients in little cubes and add a egg yolk. Then add the rice, form little balls (if you like put in the middle of some of them a little piece of feta cheese) and roll them in  a mix of flour, starch and sesame und deepfry them until they have a nice colour.
