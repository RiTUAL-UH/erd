 One night I was out with some friends, and we were waiting on the subway platform, and there was this "performer" singing.  She was terrible.  I mean really bad.  After a few minutes I walked over and offered her $2 if she would *stop* singing until the train came.  She agreed.  My friends were divided into "What an asshole", and "he's my hero" camps.  To this day, I really don't see the problem, but my wife is still embarrassed about it.

POWDER MONKEY
Words and Music by Steve Romanoff
Copyright 1985

In days of old, so the story's told,
Of boys who went to sea,
All of seven, eight and nine years old they say,
To serve upon the warring ships, their captains and their kings,
To serve the purpose they still serve today,
To serve the purpose they still serve today.
To carry up the powder from the magazine below,
From a hold too dark and crowded for a man,
The called them Powder Monkies, every schoolchild ought to know,
The price we pay to keep a promised land,
The price we pay to keep a promised land.

Send for the Powder Monkey,
Send him down into the well,
Send for the Powder Monkey,
He'll fetch us a pail o' hell
To keep out cannon burnin'
He'll fall behind the gun,
We'll just send for a Powder Monkey,
'Cause there's more where he came from.

They come from the city sidewalks and
They come from the family farm,
To trust their fragile futures to the wind,
They come from the Land of Plenty,
Through the evergreens and corn,
With more to lose than all the angry men,
With more to lose than all the angry men.
Was it the hunger of the family,
Was it the anger of the street,
That drove a lonely child to Satan's door,
Where death was all but certain and
Damnation near complete,
Save all for the holy innocent ashore,
Save all the holy innocent ashore.

From high above the gun deck
Ring the orders of the realm,
To roll out a battle cadence on the drum,
As forward into darkness
Sail the cowards at the helm,
And they shoot the stars to see how far they've come,
Look at their sons to see how far they've come.
In days of old, so the story's told
Of boys who went to sea,
All of seven, eight and nine years old they say,
To serve upon the warring ships, their captains and their kings,
To serve the purpose they still serve today,
To serve the purpose they still serve today.
 









 It just occurred to me: she could've save a lot of trouble if she'd checked the state of his equipment. 




 If you're asking "did I mean 'compelling' instead of 'compulsive', then no, I meant 'compulsive'", as in this definition: http://www.thefreedictionary.com/compulsive "Caused or conditioned by compulsion or obsession."  This is clearly the work of an inspired and gifted madman.  But the work is compelling, too :) 




 Unfortunately I can't find any videos, or even a website, I'd just assumed that he'd have one that I could find later.  I think maybe he's too busy reinventing the past to upload stuff to youtube.  But I did find these pictures which of course do no justice to the experience of seeing them in action:

Oh, and it was a 90 degree day and I got to watch him tending his propane-powered steam generator! 




 I guess I just wish his story was less believable.  I wish my government didn't have a history of abducting people and holding them in secret prisons.  I wish it didn't have a history of fabricating evidence as a pretext for an illegal war.  Maybe he's telling the truth, maybe not; I just wish I could say to myself, "No, my government would never do something like that." 




 Well, you've clearly given up here.  You've got some preconceptions that you won't let go of, even in the face of viable alternatives.

After you've spent as much time researching homeschooling as I have researching public education, maybe we can talk.

Later. 




 So you have no research, just an anecdote.  I'd be more reassured if there weren't so many examples of people who didn't develop "thicker skin with everyone out there who tries to build themselves up by tearing you down", but ended up excluded from cliques, miserable, harassed, and sometimes bullied to the point of committing suicide: http://www.cbs3springfield.com/news/local/97624929.html

If public school is really supposed to teach people how to deal with that bullshit, it's not doing a great job.  In real life, you can in fact "bug out" if you decide you're not having a good time, you're not forced to hang out with jerks.

You should read some Gatto: http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=11375 




 I'd love for you to cite the research that demonstrates that "forced socialization" is "crucial in developing fully as an individual", or that the lack of it has damaged the thousands of kids who have been home-schooled.  Home-schooled kids have plenty of options for socialization that are much more similar to the "real world" than the highly controlled, age-separated prison-like structure of public school. 




 You should seriously consider home-schooling.  It sounds like your wife has the time/inclination, and he'll just be held back by public school.  As many posters have suggested, you shouldn't try to force-feed him a curriculum, but there's no reason not to keep presenting him with opportunities to grow and learn. 




 Guess I was expecting something more Looney Tunes-ish, you know, with the barrel looking like a banana peel. 




 I can't believe I'm bothering to post to this thread, but there is a scene in [The Last Emperor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Emperor) when the former emperor is in the re-education camp, and is spoken to about this very subject, i.e. when peeing in the middle of the night, he needs to make sure to hit the side of the bowl so as not to wake his cell-mates. 




 So this woman's husband dies.  She says to the undertaker, "All my life my husband has worn nothing but black suits.  Just once I'd like to see him in blue suit, but I don't have one.  Can you help me out?"  The undertaker says, "Sure."

A few days later she shows up at the viewing, and there's her husband laid out in a handsome blue suit.  She says to the undertaker, "Thank you so much!"  The undertaker says, "No problem.  As it happens, on the same day there was a woman who wanted her husband dressed in a black suit, but all she had was blue suits."  The woman said, "Oh, so you ... ", the undertaker says, "Yeah, I just switched the heads!"

 Once I was waiting on the subway platform with a group of friends, and this woman was singing acapella.  She was *terrible*.  I walked over to her and told her I'd give her a dollar if she'd stop singing until we got onto the train.  She looked confused and explained that she'd been classically trained.  I said, "Well, I don't know much about music, but there's something very wrong here."  She accepted the dollar and stopped singing.  My wife was mortified, and one friend said, "You're either my hero or the biggest asshole I've ever met."

 Just to put your $400 in perspective:  The sysadmin and I put an incorrectly configured redirect click server into the pool, so it basically silently failed to redirect clicks to our paying advertisers, and not only that, it was logging the failures as 200s, i.e., successful pages served, so none of our Nagios alerts were fired.

she wants her husband to be buried in a dark blue suit.

He asks, "Wouldn't it just be easier to bury him in the

But she insists that it must be a blue suit and gives
him a blank check to buy one.

When she comes back for the wake, she sees her husband
in the coffin and he is wearing a beautiful blue suit.
She tells the director how much she loves the suit and
asks how much it cost. He says, "Actually, it didn't
cost anything.  The funniest thing happened.  As soon
as you left, another corpse was brought in, this one
wearing a blue suit.  I noticed that they were about
the same size, and asked the other widow if she would
mind if her husband were buried in a black suit.  She
said that was fine with her. So... I switched the heads"

 Leaving the hospital with my daughter after she was born.  My wife and I just kind of looked at each-other wondering: "Are they really going to just let us walk out of here with this infant?  Don't they know we have no fucking idea what we're doing?"  Granted we were in our 30s, but it was still pretty scary. 




 So, I was the guy who yelled out, "Is anyone here a doctor!?!".  I was with my mom and kids at the Topsfield fair, and she started feeling faint and sat down.  She had a bit of water, but I could tell she wasn't recovering.  We were actually sitting next to a kids' sing-a-long, so it was pretty noisy.  She slouched off the picnic table and I caught her and, I actually remember being a little embarrassed to start yelling, but I did.  There was a doctor and a nurse in the crowd who came to help, then the paramedics.  Turned out to be heat stroke, and she was ok, but it was scary, and it definitely felt weird to be yelling that out in a crowd.

 Fair enough, but what I think of is the difference between code that's efficient and robust enough to still work after 35 years, 10 billion miles away, compared to 99% of the crap that we write today, that will generally be thrown out and rewritten in 5 years.  By way of analogy, think of the Roman aqueducts which still stand today, compared to bridges built in the last 100 years which are already falling down and in need of repair. 




 Question: What kind of computers are used on the Voyager spacecraft?
 
Answer: There are three different computer types on the Voyager spacecraft and there are two of each kind. Total number of words among the six computers is about 32K. 

Computer Command System (CCS) - 18-bit word, interrupt type processors (2) with 4096 words each of plated wire, non-volatile memory. 

Flight Data System (FDS) - 16-bit word machine (2) with modular memories and 8198 words each 

Attitude and Articulation Control System (AACS) - 18-bit word machines (2) with 4096 words each. 

According to my calulations, that's a total of about 68KB, or small potatoes compared to today's microprocessors. We probably could perform all functions with one of today's boards and still have room for solid state data storage and much more fault detection software. We would still need a second unit for redundancy. Today's microprocessors are also much faster than the chips used on Voyager and a comparative system would use less electrical power. On the other hand, software might be more complicated as opposed to that used in an interrupt type system, but it would be much more capable and more flexible. 

Let's look closer at the CCS. The CCS has two main functions: to carry out instructions from the ground to operate the spacecraft, and to be alert for a problem or malfunction and respond to it. Two identical 4096- word memories contain both fixed routines (about 2800 words) and a variable section (about 1290 words) for changing science sequences. The CCS issues commands to the AACS for movement of the scan platform or spacecraft maneuvers; to the FDS for changes in instrument configurations or telemetry rates and to numerous other subsystems within the spacecraft for specific actions. Fault-protection algorithms are also stored in the CCS, occupying roughly 10 percent of the CCS memory. 

The main functions of the FDS are to collect data from, and controls the operations of, the scientific instruments; and to format engineering and science data for on-board storage and/or real-time transmission. The FDS also keeps the spacecraft "time" and provides frequency references to the instruments and other spacecraft subsystems. 

The Voyager spacecraft computers are interrupt driven computer, similar to processors used in general purpose computers with a few special instructions for increased efficiency. The programming is a form of assembly language. 

There is no clock chip, as such, in the spacecraft. The "clock" is really a counter, based on one of several electronically generated frequencies. These frequencies, based on a reference, generated by a very stable oscillator, are converted and fed to different locations in the spacecraft as synchronization signals, timers, counters, etc. The "clock" signal is part of the information telemetered to the ground and it is with ground software that we convert to day of year, time of day Greenwich Mean Time. 

Voyager was built in-house at JPL; the computers were manufactured by General Electric to JPL specifications.

We probably could perform all functions with one of today's boards and still have room for solid state data storage and much more fault detection software. We would still need a second unit for redundancy. Today's microprocessors are also much faster than the chips used on Voyager and a comparative system would use less electrical power. On the other hand, software might be more complicated as opposed to that used in an interrupt type system, but it would be much more capable and more flexible. 

Let's look closer at the CCS. The CCS has two main functions: to carry out instructions from the ground to operate the spacecraft, and to be alert for a problem or malfunction and respond to it. Two identical 4096- word memories contain both fixed routines (about 2800 words) and a variable section (about 1290 words) for changing science sequences. The CCS issues commands to the AACS for movement of the scan platform or spacecraft maneuvers; to the FDS for changes in instrument configurations or telemetry rates and to numerous other subsystems within the spacecraft for specific actions. Fault-protection algorithms are also stored in the CCS, occupying roughly 10 percent of the CCS memory. 

The main functions of the FDS are to collect data from, and controls the operations of, the scientific instruments; and to format engineering and science data for on-board storage and/or real-time transmission. The FDS also keeps the spacecraft "time" and provides frequency references to the instruments and other spacecraft subsystems. 

The Voyager spacecraft computers are interrupt driven computer, similar to processors used in general purpose computers with a few special instructions for increased efficiency. The programming is a form of assembly language. 

There is no clock chip, as such, in the spacecraft. The "clock" is really a counter, based on one of several electronically generated frequencies. These frequencies, based on a reference, generated by a very stable oscillator, are converted and fed to different locations in the spacecraft as synchronization signals, timers, counters, etc. The "clock" signal is part of the information telemetered to the ground and it is with ground software that we convert to day of year, time of day Greenwich Mean Time. 

Voyager was built in-house at JPL; the computers were manufactured by General Electric to JPL specifications.

 Years later, Pavel was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the bear enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Pavel and his son Pavel Jr. were standing. The large bear stared at Pavel, lifted its paws off the ground, and played with a plastic chair. The bear did that several times then roared loudly, all the while staring at the man. 

Remembering the his dear friend from 2011, Pavel couldn't help wondering if this was the same bear. Pavel summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the bear and stared back in wonder. The bear roared again, wrapped its arms around Pavel's chest and crushed his ribcage, killing him instantly. Probably wasn't the same bear. 









 But there [is hope](http://www.amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/offset_smokers.html). 









 I'm using a standard Char-broil offset smoker, and I'm monitoring the temperature, keeping it between 230 and 250 for 7, or even 8 hours.  I've also got a water pan in there to keep things moist.  But the ribs and boston butt are never done, and the fat isn't completely rendered, so I have to finish them in a 350 degree oven for half an hour to an hour.  How can they not be done after 8 hours? 

The only other clue I have is that I'm monitoring the temperature with a redi-check remote thermometer, which is an internal-temperature thermometer; is it possible that this is giving me an incorrect reading?

This is driving me insane.  I'd appreciate any advice, Pitmasters.

EDIT: OK, thanks for the advice.  It sounds like I need a new thermometer, and to learn about this newfangled "3-2-1 Method".  Depending on how that works, I'll look into heat loss.

BTW, I'm not using the thermometer for internal meat temperature, I'm using it for the ambient internal temperature of the smoker.

 How are you planning on printing them.  For etchings/engravings/drawings, I'd like to find a service bureau with a high quality laser printer who could print on nice paper.  Any recommendations?

 That looks like a good choice.  I have a similar Char-broil model that I got from Home Depot a few years ago for about the same price.  Go for it! 




 Excellent.  Thanks for the link to the paints. 




 Hey all.  I've had a standard Char-broil offset smoker for a few years, and the firebox is getting pretty rusty on the top and sides, I assume from the heat.  Has anybody else confronted this situation? 




 Yeah, I just added the "Add My Local Library Branch" link.  If you click on it, it then tries to determine your location. 




 Fixed.  Thanks for the QA! 




 Sweet!  I'll get on that :) 




 OK, done! 




 Good idea.  Thanks! 









 If you share your location it will return results from your local library.

Two Arabs are sitting in the window and middle seats on a plane. The Arabs ask the Jew sitting in the aisle seat to get them a glass of orange juice so they won't have to crawl over him. While he is up getting the drinks, they spit in his shoes. When they are about to land the Jewish guy puts on his shoes and realizes what has happened. He complains to the Arabs, "When will it all end? The hatred... the violence... the killing... the spitting in shoes... the peeing in orange juice..."
