Havre de Grace, Maryland, U.S.A


I posted the above link a few days ago, with the hopes of finding someone to help ease the situation me and my family are in. But today I got some bad news, and its made my situation more dire. My brother has to pay in on his taxes, due to some sort of penalty for not having health insurance last year, and its pushing us to the breaking point.

The special circumstances I mentioned in my title are that I wouldn't be able to repay the loan anytime soon. I'm looking for someone who can understand the situation I'm in and have enough faith in me to trust that I will repay. Even though it may be over a year before I can. I know this goes against the "short term" rules of the sub, but I'm desperate and I'm hoping against hope that you all can take pity for our situation and look the other way.

As far as interest goes, I'm not sure how to go about deciding it. Its something we can discuss if you decide you might be able to help.

I'm not sure on payment methods either. I have a Gofundme account set up, but if their is a quicker method for receiving the payment I'd very much like to use it. The sooner I can get this money to my family, the sooner things will look up for us.

I'm at rock bottom here, and its killing me. Please, if you've ever been in a similar situation and have the means to help me. I'm begging you.

$600

Edit: Someone told me I need a Paypal account to receive help from this sub. I tried creating an account but was unable to because I don't have a debit or credit card. Please, if their are other ways to make this transaction possible, consider them. I can't begin to express how horrifying this whole situation is. 




 Is something fucky? 




 An example of the type of person we should all aspire to be. 




 I don't. I think its terrible that you could believe she "helped" him. He may have been bogged down by personal demons, may have suffered from mental disorders. But were living in a time in history when we finally have some tools to help alleviate those problems.

To think she encouraged him to die, than flips everything and uses his death as a means to make herself look good through charity work is beyond low. That she can talk about how tough life is and how helping others alleviates that pain, when she convinced a man to kill himself. To inhale those noxious fucking chemicals until his heart stopped, is beyond me. How exactly do you think his family feels? I'd bet money they didn't know he was suffering, that he was unhappy. Family is usually the last to know in a situation like this, because the person in question has become so adept at hiding their feelings, and doesn't want them burdened.

I wish you could tell his family your view in person and see first-hand what their going through. What kind of goddamn hell it is to lose someone because they took their own life. To play the last moments you had with them over and over, to wonder while you lay awake if you could've done something. To wish they had reached out to you, because in your heart you know you'd do anything for them.

This has nothing to do with bandwagon mentality, this has to do with people being held responsible for their actions. He wasn't in a proper state of mind when he finally decided to go through with the act. And when that malnourished and defeated voice in his head spoke up and said this isn't right, said get out of the car. That little bitch told him to get back in.

 Amazing salad. 




 He expressed feelings that he didn't want to leave his family, on top of getting out of the vehicle when he first started it. He could have been helped.

Suicide is only an option for those who are terminally ill, people with no quality of life left to live.

Your reply is ignorant and unwanted. what she did is no different than someone who coaxes a mentally ill person to drink antifreeze because the thought crossed their mind. Suicide is almost always a symptom of other problems, something that until today I thought was common knowledge. 




 Thanks for the help friend. *Internet hug* 




 She deserves a long jail sentence. She had the life of another human being in her hands, could have done any number of things to help him, and she didn't. She took someone who was confused and in a bad state of mind, and convinced him to take his life. 

This piece of garbage isn't human in my eyes. She's a disgusting stain that should face the same fate she pushed that poor guy to.

I've been on both ends of the spectrum of suicide, I've dealt with those thoughts myself and had a close family member take their life. I can't express how angry reading this makes me. I hope they impose the heaviest sentence on her that the law will allow. 




 I'm actively working with my therapist and psychiatrist to find coping skills and the right medicine regime. 

Thanks for the insight into applying for disability. I don't think its something that would pan out for me. I want to get back to work. And the idea of spending all that time and effort for something I may not need when I get it, if I get it at all, doesn't seem worthwhile. On top of that, I really believe I can get to a point where I can work within the next year or two. And I don't want to bog down an already slow system and impede other people who are worse off than myself. 




 Is that the average wait time? 




 I get foodstamps for myself, but it only goes so far. I budget it well but the cost of food is outrageous in my opinion. I never thought to check on disability, thought I was too young for it. Thanks for the advice. :) 




 I appreciate your advice, I really do. But what your suggesting isn't a possibility for me, at least not in the foreseeable future. I bring in no money of my own, so asking my family for the capital to attempt this would be necessary. Things are strained now between us, and asking for money for crafts when our fridge is nearly empty wouldn't go over well. 

I'd also face the issue of trying to sell them. I live in a rural area with the closest town 5 1/2 miles away. On top of which I have fairly severe anxiety, and talking to people I don't know is very hard. Trying to sell stuff to strangers makes me anxious just thinking about it.

Please don't misconstrue this as anything negative, that I'm unable to implement your idea. I'm deeply thankful you took the time to read my post and offer your insight. *Internet hug*

P.S. - I wasn't much of a Dickens fan in high school, but maybe I should revisit some of his works. I am a big fan of Orwell, have been since I read Animal Farm. 




 Thank you :) 




 Havre de Grace, Maryland 




 Hello to all. My name's Joshua, Josh for short. I'm here because I need help, my family needs help. I'm not sure what to write, if I deserve to post here, but I need to try something. 

I've been unemployed for about a year now, give or take, due to health problems. Since I was young I've suffered from OCD, depression, bipolar disorder, ADD, and chronic insomnia. I never received help for it growing up, which has put me in a very bad spot. I'm 23, and I've worked seven different jobs since I was old enough to work. I've been forced to leave them all because of my mental health issues. The longest was a job as a cook at a fine dining restaurant that I managed to hold down for almost two years. I live with my mother and younger brother, who work to keep us off the streets. We live in my grandfather's house. We used to live with him, but he committed suicide last year on his 88th birthday.

My family works full time. My brother works especially hard, trying to help compensate for my lack of income. I'm on state insurance, and have been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for several months. I'm slowly getting better, but its an uphill battle that's getting harder and harder to fight. The weight of the bills, the arguments, the unhappiness. All because of me and my inability to work. The stress and anxiety is killing me inside. I hate showing my face around them, knowing how miserable they are because I was born defective and can't contribute.

Which I guess brings me to the reason for this post. The bad weather has negatively affected both their jobs, and they haven't been getting the hours they were. We have bills that are past due, and their having trouble catching up. If there is anyone reading this who can help me, I'd get on my knees and beg you if I could. A monetary gift to help pay the outstanding bills, get our trash service back, and other small things. Things like cab fare to and from my appointments. My insurance doesn't cover medical transport, so if my mom is working and can't drive me, I have to take a cab. Because if I miss two or more appointments I have to reapply to be seen and it takes months so I can't risk it. Gift wasn't the right word to use, I'm not sure what is. Any help you can give me, I will repay. I promise you that. It may be a year or two from now, but I will reimburse for your kindness. My grandfather taught me to always pay my debts, and I do.

If your not in a position to help in a physical way, I'd love very much for someone to talk to. I don't have any friends and have no one I can talk to here. A kind soul who wouldn't mind talking with me would be an amazing gift in itself.

That's pretty much it, not sure what else to say. My anxiety has been terrible these past few days, and getting all this out has helped ease it.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, it means a lot to me.

 Helen Keller wasn't born blind. 




 Lucas was a known compulsive liar, Otis not so much. I'm more inclined to believe in his deviation over Lucas's. 




 His partner in crime, Otis Toole. Was known to eat people. In an interview he gave while incarcerated. He described disemboweling a young boy, jamming a rod in his ass and through his mouth. Cooking him on a spit fire all while basting him in his secret BBQ sauce he used just for people. At the end of the interview he said anyone interested in trying it could write him and he'd send a copy of the recipe back.

 I think body spray would work, just use as little as possible on your hands. a bath would probably work in the same way, I just don't know how long after the bath their natural odors would return. Which I think is why my vet told me to try the cologne/perfume/spray route first, because it completely masks their natural scents for a good amount of time. you may also need to do it for a few days, but once a day only. my two fought like hell when I first introduced them, and I did it for I think 2-3 days. the fighting gradually toned down and they became best friends :)

I'd suggest cleaning the cage too, help remove some of the male's scent. Don't worry about toys and stuff that aren't washable, they shouldn't be too big of a problem. But if you want, try and remove them after you neutralize their scents, and put the toys back after a couple days. Make up for the lack of stimulation by handling them more, both at the same time. I did the same with mine. 




 Something that worked for me when I introduced a new friend to my little man, is to put a dab of cologne or perfume on your hand and pet them both. the tiniest amount possible and rub it over both hands. it neutralizes both scents and helps ease them into spending time together. 




 I love you Mr. Burgundy.

 I've been on benzos before and my advice is STAY AWAY. I was on 1mg Klonopin a day, and I ended up with severe side effects. Numbness, difficulty breathing, photophobia, insomnia, hot/cold flashes, I legitimately thought I was going to die. You can experience these side effects even if you do everything your dr. tells you, and they can last for years. I've been off them for about 4 months, and I'm still having problems with numbness in my arms and legs. Unless you think you REALLY need them, stay faaaaar away. 




 *What other people think of you is none of your business.* My therapist told me that and I've found it to be very helpful.

 Try b12 vitamins, they'll help put some pep in your step. 5-Hour Energy's work too, just be careful with them. I didn't listen to the instructions on them one stressful day at work and I downed 2 extra strength and 1 regular in a very short period. I had heart palpitations and couldn't bend over without my heart skipping a beat. Which is a serious problem when you cook for a living.

 Thank you OP, for posting this. 




 I agree with you to an extent. But you'll find if you delve into it that people being spared by reason of insanity is a very rare occurrence. And is the exception rather than the rule. The entire situation with Gein is kind of a Catch-22, his victims deserve justice but at the same time is it right to kill someone with the mental capacity of a child? 




 Ed Gein was born in 1906, the psychological trauma he endured from his mother as well as the severe isolation imposed on him carried on through his childhood up until well after his mother's passing.

At the time psychology was, in all intensive respects, in its infancy. Hell, the World Health Organization (WHO) didn't announce mental health as an important aspect of healthcare until 1946.

Brock Chisolm quoted saying: "Surely the training of children in home and schools should be of at least as great public concern as their vaccination.... Individuals who have emotional disabilities of their own--guilts, fears, inferiorities--are certain to project their hates on to others... [S]uch reaction now becomes a dangerous threat to the whole world....

So yes, while we do have pills that aid in fixing chemical imbalances and easing the mental problems of those afflicted. We also have a completely different attitude toward mental disease as a whole, and modern therapy reflects that as well as everything we've come to understand in the last 100 years.

Its easy for people to bash on mental health methodology and say they just throw pills at people until they become docile enough to tolerate, but that's not really the case. And I can attest to that personally. I've been diagnosed by two psychiatrists, both determining I have moderate OCD as well as other problems that are comorbid to it. I spent most of my life in a state of misery and fear, but now that I'm seeing a wonderful therapist and have a psych who's helping me find a proper medication regime, things are really starting to look up. 




 Only two murders, the rest of the corpses were dug up from a local cemetery. The car he used to transport them was sold in an auction after everything came out. His home was burned down, but the culprit was never caught. 




 I'd be gay for Bowie. 




 Fucking hilarious. 




 You'd be surprised what someone who's spent their life hunting can do with a sharp enough knife. 




 He also had nipple belts, shoeboxes filled with female genitalia. Skin masks, skin chairs, skin lamps. He would make bowls from their skulls. He drew the line at necrophilia though, albeit just because he couldn't get over the smell. He would gut them and leave them to dry in his barn.

His is a really sad case. For all the horrible stuff he did, he was very mentally ill. When he was caught he spent the rest of his days at an institution, and the people who worked with him said you could never hope to meet a nicer person. Thankfully psychology has advanced since then and we have the means to help people before they deteriorate to this point.

Edit: For anyone interested in reading on him I highly recommend this book. The author is very well respected in true-crime circles and is very credible. Word of warning for the squeamish, it does contain some photos of the gutted bodies he had hanging in his barn.

 Imagine you have unbidden, unwanted thoughts about people close to you dying. Everytime the thought occurs an unknown forces sucker-punches you, spreading a crippling sense of paralysis through your body. The means to alleviate that unknown force can be damn near anything. Checking lights, repeating words, the most pointless and unnecessary actions. You know that but you HAVE to complete the action over and over to assuage that crippling pain. And for a lot of us, the more you give in the more intense and complex those compulsions become. Until you're spending hours washing your hands or touching the doorknobs in "the right way".

 Honestly, I'd have to say Snape. 




 That's impressive! 




 Thank you so, so much friend. Like I said in my post, I'll repay your kindness once I'm back on my feet. This means a lot to me. 




 I appreciate the kind words, its nice knowing I'm not the only one who feels this way. *hugs* 




 Thank you for the kind words :) *Hug* 




 My name's Josh. I have OCD, GSA, depression, ADD, insomnia, and bipolar disorder. I'm out of work because of it, and its made mine and my family's life very hard. I'm currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, who are working with me step by step.

I'm here to ask for help. My anxiety has been getting harder and harder to cope with, and I need help. When I was working I would sometimes visit a natural market and buy powdered valerian root to make tea, it would ease my anxiety and I loved it because it was all natural. I'm hoping someone here can sympathize and understand how horrible dealing with these problems can be, and can extend a helping hand. I will in turn repay you for your kindness when I'm able to, though I'm not sure when that will be. I have an appointment with my psych next week and were supposed to discuss my med regimen.

I'm asking if someone can pay for this powdered valerian they sell on Amazon. Its about $10 including shipping, and 4oz lasts a long time. Somebody please help me, I'm tired of crying because I can't deal with my anxiety.

 This is my all-time favorite Bertstrip ever. 




 Psycho. That movie set the precedent for horror films for generations to come. 
























 I thought it was fun and interesting too. Came to me earlier when I was deep into a marathon. 




 That I know of, only one can was seen near the Land Titanic. Arguably it could have been the only one aboard, hidden away. Which makes sense given how rich some of the passengers were, such as Mr. Astor. But their where also numerous poor and middle-class people, so it doesn't make sense that they would have a supply on board when the fish is already so rare.

Edit: Saw the pic you are referencing, and it is only a single can. Which leans toward my hypothesis.

 I highly recommend watching the movie. The conversation alone helped me see everything in my life in a new perspective. 














 It is indeed. Silicon Penis Man at your service.

 Definitely try it out, just make sure to remove any seeds first and give it a good wash. 




 Try de-seeded red pepper. No more than 1/4 of a slice. Cavies can eat peppers every so often and that small slice has 10x the vitamin C of an entire orange. When I found out about it I wondered why they keep making orange juice when peppers get the job done so much better lol. 




 I'm in love.

 Not exactly. The photo was found on a roll of film after Corll was killed, belonging to one of his accomplices. He couldn't remember taking the photo or who the guy was, but was able to come up with a timeline based on when the camera was purchased.

In the photo the guy isn't strapped to Corll's torture wall, so odds are his nightmare was just beginning in this pic. The torture wall was what he cuffed them to when the actual rape/torture occurred.

 The blood you see is his. The film opens with him eviscerating himself, followed by Mother Nature masturbating his corpse and impregnating herself with his semen. 














 #I want to address the points people are bringing up:

*The evolution aspect is completely possible. Earth goes through a period of radiation, introduction of alien bacteria, etc. Not to mention you're applying evolution as observed on earth to beings from a distant planet.

*Harold Zoid. We know Decapods shed their shells when they become cramped, but Harold has been a shut-in for years. He's to poor to afford a new one, which would explain why he looks so decrepit. Not to mention it would explain his bad attitude because his soft body is painfully squished in his carapace. 




 Consider though that Decapods shed their shells when they get cramped, but Harold is poor as hell, so I doubt he can afford one. It might also explain why he's so unpleasant because he's cramped in an old, deteriorating shell.

 Keep in mind what the world goes through during that time though. All the radiation, introduction of alien bacteria, etc. It's possible that those factors altered his species evolution, and that's only if we apply the understanding of evolution on earth. It could be different on Decapod 10. 




 The exact quote is, "That stench - that heavenly stench." 




 That would be awesome. Maybe we need to chant for them like Candyman or Bloody Mary. 




 Holy shit this hits close to home for me.
