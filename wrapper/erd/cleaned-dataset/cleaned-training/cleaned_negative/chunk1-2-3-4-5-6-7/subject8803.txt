 When pressed you jump back to the last thing happened: a building or unit that just finished, or when you get attacked.
Its not super super vital, but comes in handy sometimes. 




 Dat Thorzain smirk in the background  









 Lagging as hell for me too (EU), almost unwatchable. 




 So sad i am not able to play this qualifier, next one i will be attending for sure! 




 very surprised no one posed [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDHHdrDQx_A) 




 This + SSX and a lot of EA games where basically my musical education. Man, was (am) always jamming out while playing need for speed! 




 really confused by the cum-like stains on your shirt.. 




 Best dancer in SC2, would love to see those moves in the booth haha!
 




 Ax.HyuN plz 




 SC2 HOTS! 




 Cmon guys, this impersonator deserves an audience! 




 Anyone up for making a platinum/diamond team? I am really lacking practice partners, or a decent place to find a few.. 




 Pretty known for sc2 players: try google "zerg rush" and get that korean APM! 




 [Here you go](http://www.dlcompare.com/games/cd-key-download-starcraft-2-european-127) this is keys only though i think.

Also, pretty new to reddit, thought it was cool to share, guess not :( 




 All i can say is: Thank you dApollo for your awesome tutorials! 
























 Its kinda lame they re-used so many stuff from the other trailer.

Still hyped though! 




 Well, that is the least touched game on my desktop i think, and i have only played a few PvP's. So i can't really tell if it's pay to win. 

It's pretty fun though, but i prefer the old aoe (: 




 basically [this](http://imgur.com/xVEZDJP).

everything besides sc2 casually though. 




 AHWWWW man, I LOVE SC2!!! 




 This series is soooo nerve wrecking 0__o 




 are there any vods anywhere? (:
 




 Yo buddy, caps lock button is right above the shift key on the left. 




 I DON'T KNOW KEV! 




 well that took a nosedive 




 Darn, missed it, can i watch a vod somewhere? (:
EDIT: already found it, thank you for casting that! hope you liked it (:
oh and you pronounced my name really funny but no worries, the 'oe' sounds doesn't exist in English(: 




 may i ask why you made this?  




 Submitted mine!  




 This is from quite a while ago, and it is embarrasing to watch for me now, but i think this was the closest game in my still short SC2 career, hope you like it (: 









 assholes in german. 




 may I ask where you live? Hillevi is far from a normal (cat) name where i come from
. 




 Grubby is like, oh this guy again 0__o 
























 And Blizzard WCS if that is gonna be held again. 




 JoRoShaRk 




 Wasn't this posted on here like a few months ago? I've already seen this somewhere for sure.. 




 I was plat in WoL, got placed in silver, quite disappointed. Just got gold today, but i dont really feel confident in my use of the new units. Lots of work to do! 




 Ik ben sowieso aanwezig! Zin in! 




 I dont know if this was already posted on here, but Totalbiscuit made quite an interesting [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uwAo8lcAC4) about this topic. 




 the two best analitical casters out there, woohoo! I also like the choice for Take as host. And geoff just always makes me laugh. Man, this tourney is gonna be awesome! 




 Are there any pictures of the whole thing out of the water? 




 when life gives me lemons imma throw em at your car. 




 you a pretty dirty window. 




 Ja hoor jongens, weer iets om trots op te zijn! 




 Och nee, heeft t weer gesneeuwd? 0__o 




 parting's multitasking was so incredible throughout the whole mid   lategame!! 




 Oh wow, i listened many many times to this song, but never saw this vid, thanks! 









 Wow, this just hits the nail on the head. Everyone is always talking about how the mainstream music becomes worse and worse, but this just proves it. 




 that's what she said.. 
























 Radical Face - Welcome home, Son. When the chorus kicks in, still gives me the same, happy feeling every time i hear it. [Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8a4iiOnzsc)  




 Really loving all the subtle things in this season so far, the zealot in the dish, the cheese throwing, the balance joking (reaper changes, super long range on nexus cannon) Just gives it that little extra! 




 Because getting laid is of course the only purpouse of playing guitar. 




 Does anyone know if the startale video where Legend is trying to become a pro player is on youtube? I cant seem to find it, really enjoyed it when they played it during a tournament. 




 do you happen to have a link to that VOD? 




 TIL op_is_sea_gm_fyi is a fellow dutchmen 




 I think Huk and Ret aren't talking about the same thing, huk complains about him getting denied to compete in both code A and WCS NA/EU while players in code S are allowed to do this, Ret is giving his opinion about koreans playing in WCS NA/EU in the first place. 2 very different things 




 basically your MMR (the hidden ranking score system blizzard uses) has to be steady in the league you want to get promoted too. What this means: when you face, and win from gold players regularly you will get promoted soon. It can be a bit random sometimes though. 




 thats pretty sweet! 




 Well as its a new game the timing aren't figured out yet. So i think you can get into diamond now with decent mechanics, i play a reactionary style most of the time. 




 So I (diamond Protoss) just started playing around a bit on the unranked ladder as Zerg (my zerg skills are bronze/silver i think). 
I got matched vs a platinum protoss player and lost quite badly.
after the match i noticed that his league symbol changed to diamond.
So after a quick chat i found out he queued for the ranked ladder, and got promoted to diamond after the match. I think this is a bit unfair. **What do you guys think?**

TL;DR: Opponent gets promoted on the back of my diamond protoss MMR, while I played offrace on the unranked ladder. Fair/unfair? 




 Amsterdam is 4 meters below sealevel, so a flood is pretty likely to happen somewhere in the future. 




 I used a build like this in WoL a lot, but it indeed does work vs 3 hatch openings in HotS.
I don't have an exact build order, but here is roughly what i do:

FFE, if you can gateway before cannon (scout no early pool)
2 gasses
gateway 100% -- cyber core.
zealot (send to watchtower/third base if you 
chronoboost in probes until cybercore is finished, after that only chrono boost cybercore
+1 att @ 100gas (chrono when you can)
stalker.
3 gates @50% cybercore
stop probe production
3/4/5 more gates
forward pylons
should be hitting around 8:30-9:00 i think.

Hope this helps! 




 Hots started out really rough, got placed in silver after beeing plat in WoL. But after laddering for a week im back, [better than ever!](http://imgur.com/NarmerN) 




 whoopsie, missed that post/sticky. Sorry! 









 Same happened to me, got placed in silver and ranked up to plat in a few days. Sad thing is i was plat already in WoL. Oh well lets aim for diamond my brotoss! 
























 Even curses follow the law nowadays. 




 wow, does he hotkey all his hatches seperate or what inject method does he use?  




 star conflict! It is kinda a thrid person shooter in space with space ships, always dreamed about a game like this when I was a kid. and now it's free to play on steam! 




 im a bit late to the party, but its because the working of the neurons in your eye, they are wired in suchs a way that you percieve more contrast than there actually is. its a bit of a long story, will edit later with a link when im not on my phone. very interesting topic of neuroscience! 




 Rain had that, totally screwed it up. He played so well for the first half.. but oh man what a game, nerdchills! 




 these hype video's really do get better and better. looking forward to another weekend full of ESPORTS! 




 This! Hitting a perfect drift while singing/shouting along with this chorus was one of the best things about this game. 




 I actually saw them live at sziget festival about 2 years ago. Oh man, that tent went wild when they played this song! 




 I live in Amsterdam and I always listen to this song while riding my bike on the way home in the night. The mixture of the relaxation of an sleeping, beautifull city and the atmosphere this song creates gives me the chills every single time. And when it finally kicks in, oh boy im racing on that bike. 




 Wow, thats really good! Thanks for sharing. 




 Crazy how GuMiho came back after beeing down to like 9 scv's to 25 drones at one point, almost a little sad he didnt pull it off! 




 As a dutchie I think i would really miss hagelslag. 




 the problem is that a quarter of the stalled bikes in the big cities in the Netherlands will never be picked up again..  




 I normally get 4 in early-midgame PvT, cutting that bio in half on ramps an chokepoints in awesome, later often only 2 because i wont use them anyway. (only pop GS before storming and so on) in PvP most of the time 2, mostly for GS as well in every fight. In PvZ i get about 4-8, dependig on my own and mostly the strat of my opponent. But the best thing about sentries is: scout every 1.5 - 2 mins for bases, tech changes, army comp and so on with hallu phoenix, in every matchup! 




 Yep this seems to do the trick for me too almost always. No need to restart the client! still very annoying though.. 




 Such confident play by Grubby! he just really outplayed MC, im pleasently surprised. 




 The landscape in the netherlands is indeed quite boring, but if you visit the south of Limburg (where i grew up) you'll be surprised by the hills and creeks etc. Still nothing like the grand canyon though. 
























 The neo tokyo remix of this song is one of my all time favorite tunes. (cant link from phone)

Original never dissapoints too though!  




 Even better than [this](http://youtu.be/tAHSPR1iY_0?t=2m37s) 




 Ha, i live at about a 5 minute bikeride from the ziggo dome! 

Sadly that is the bad part of the city :( 




 Met bier en Starcraft ben ik al een heel gelukkig man. 




 Oh wow! very nice to see this happening, I'll be there! 




 You can keep a close eye on [Ticketswap](www.ticketswap.nl) Its a safe(ish) website where people sell their tickets if they bought one but are not able to go. Other than that you can search for the facebook event, at most concerts there is someone who tries to sell their ticket (mostly last minute though and there is a possibility you get scammed) 

Good luck! 




 A shame i didnt see any of the last game, horrible lagg :( 




  Get a lock that is more expensive then your bike.

This is gold advice (but a bit over the top) you can get a really decend bike for 50-80 euro's (or 10-20 form a junk) and a really good lock for +-40. 

also, a bike stealing friend of mine once told me: "if your bike is not attached to something like a post or a rail with its lock, then its not locked" 




 This is more a question for /r/allthingszerg. I think you will get more response and constructive feedback than on this subreddit.

 Wow, where does the original picture come from? i had [this picture](http://imgur.com/boty6lO) as my phone background for the longest time but never knew it was from somewhere/something.. cool shop btw! 




 I was thinking why this line was so familiar to me.
It is actually used at the beginning of a PvP game of star conflict (f2p online steam game with spaceships), pretty cool! 




 Aaand save 




 Nice touch on the Pick of Destiny! 




 Wow, nice pickup for millenium! Hopefully he will now grow out to be the top Protoss he always looks like he is trying to become. gogo babyK! 




 I love you

 Why not use the slideshow option and use them all? Personally i like these two maybe even better: [Imgur](http://imgur.com/IpGjISP,u1b5pfS#1) 









 The red light district in Amsterdam. 

It is suchs a sad place to walk around. All these girls behind the windows selling their body's and clearly not wanting to be there. All these fucked up lives.. The place just screams sadness. I always get really uncomfortable when I have to be in that area. 




 Ahw yiss scorpions @ 3am even better! (Although its 8 am where i live)

 Relax, wash, sit. 




 Game of Thrones. Watch it. 




 I dont know if i was lucky or if the prices are always that low, but last summer i went to paris and back with www.megabus.com for something like 15.

 I dont know if you are a type that likes to go out, but check out the agenda for Paradiso. If there is anything playing you know/like it's worth spending an evening. Its a very special place to enjoy a concert/show. 




 [Get the snitch, Chilton!](http://imgur.com/xM5nqTC) 




 Completely agreed. It is also really wierd that to call a team that represents their city and not their country World Champions. You also dont call the winner of the champions league (football/soccer in EU) World Champions, you call the winner of the world championship world champions. And only teams that represent a country can participate. 




 [Hey man, cmon!](http://imgur.com/gallery/xV3sl) 









 welp, i feel a bit like a pedo if thats true... :/
