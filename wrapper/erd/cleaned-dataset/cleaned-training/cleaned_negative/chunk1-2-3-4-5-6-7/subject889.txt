 After seeing a post on Facebook about organ donation, I was appalled by the sheer number of people who felt that older people do not deserve organs because they have already lived their lives. 

I got so mad when these people said things like "that's dumb, why didn't they give the organ to a younger person?"

And while I know not every can know the details of how organs are allocated, it just bothered me that so many people thought so little of the elderly and felt that the young deserved more in life.

Youth really is wasted on the young! 









 Hi guys.

I was hoping someone could help me find a pattern for an edging that would produce a similar result to [this]( http://i.imgur.com/nVDqJVm.jpg). The pic is knitted and I was hoping for a crochet equivalent.

Please and thank you!

 This is an X post, forgot to put that in title.

ver the last few years I have felt like my general well-being is in decline. My co-workers call it stress, my friends call it old-age (I'm 24!!!) and my doctor just says it is nothing. However, the more I tally up my issues, the more I think/worry most of them may have a singular cause:

Tinnitus/v. sensitive hearing 

Blurred in one eye, nearsightedness (only recently discovered- never noticed before and not brought up in childhood eye tests)

Headaches/Migraines

Neck pain/severe muscle tension (Go to Chiro, Physio AND Remedial masseuse)

Forgetfulness (short term, things slip away quickly)

Twitches/muscle spasms 

Twitching eye 

Heart palpatations w adrenaline rush

Slightly enlarged optic nerve in right eye

Boughts of vertigo/dizziness/ ground feels like it is moving

Occasional insomnia (who doesn't get this, but i thought I would include it)

Fatigue

Lately, lack of enthusiasm for even fun activities


Bronchial cough

Short of breath

(Diagnosed with Stress-Related asthma. but as I lie here in bed, relaxing, I am short of breath, sooo....?)

I know some of these are general and vague problems that millions of people also deal with. I don't want a wild, obscure internet diagnosis, I just want to know whether, as Doctors, you would find these symptoms cause for concern. If so, I will push my GP to paying closer attention.

Further background: 24yo F Healthy weight, eats well, exercises regularly, normal blood pressure, previously noted 'slightly high' heart rate like I was nervous whilst getting tested (didn't feel nervous), no abnormal blood tests save for a single one with low blood proteins (retest was normal, ?lab error). Medication: The Pill and regular paracetamol for headaches

If it is just stress, what can I do? I take regular Me Time, exercise regularly, don't take work home with me, don't sit and fret on issues. This year I will be moving interstate but that decision is only weeks old and some of these issues have been around for a few years.

 I just left a $2000 tube of reagent on the counter in my lab over the weekend, ruining it.

 A conversation between my husband and I last night.

Husband: Hey train_subject889, remember the promise you made that you wouldn't let your crochet take over the house?

Me: Yeah...

Husband: Well, you broke it 



















 My hubby is Pats mad. He has been following them since he was little, despite none of his family having any interest in the game. He just watched them play one day and hasn't stop watching since.

We are travelling to America in October this year and although there are many things on our to-do list, the whole trip will be based around us getting to Boston amd seeing a Pats home game.

Now, hubby will have his bday while we are over there, so I am hoping to find some sort of 'special experience' tickets to surprise him with. I'm thinking VIP box, stadium tour, anything like that. Hell, if I can somehow get him in the same room as Tom Brady, he would probably pass out with joy.

So, can anyone help me? Point me in the direction of a place I can get this? Or even just tell me if it is possible/affordable?

Thanks!

I bought 7 x 50g balls just because they were on sale for $1.20 but now I don't know what to do with it.

It is gorgeously soft and slippery and feels magic against my skin, so I was hoping to make something like a jumper or shawl. But I haven't found any pattern that would work with the glossy, slippery nature of the yarn.

Suggestions? 




 Once or twice a week I sit next to a lady on the train who is an avid crocheter, like me. We first spoke when she complimented me on my amugurumi kitty I was working on. Over the weeks we have had great chats, discussing our favourite yarn brands, the best stitches and new patterns we have found. I look forward to my train trips now and enjoy our chats immensely.

This morning, the nice lady delivered on a promise I hadn't really expected her to keep and gave me a bag full of cashmere yarns with the condition that I make another kitty out of it just so she could see how it turned out.

I was very thankful and happy that someone would be so friendly and giving to a complete stranger, without expecting anything in return. 

Crocheters really are the nicest people!

 My step brother is interested in signing up for a business opportunity provided by a company called Vemma. The model is based on sales of healthy products supplied by the company as well as membership sign up.

 You have to pay to recieve the product and then your sales numbers and how many people you get to join equate to an income. They aren't talking huge dollars for the most part but it seems a little too easy.

It has been labelled a pyramid scheme, and I am not certain but I can see why it would be called that. [This]( http://yprzone.com/) is their website and [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtSmuX9ID5o feature=youtube_gdata_player) is their video.

Does anyone know anything about them? Have any horror or success stories?

 Hi guys! I am making a 12x12 granny square quilt. I am 56 squares in and still undecided about how I will join them all together.

I have narrowed it down to two techniques:

The [slip stitch]( http://attic24.typepad.com/weblog/joining-granny-sqaures.html) method

Or the [invisible stitch]( http://doyoumindifiknit.typepad.com/do_you_mind_if_i_knit/2010/02/joining-up-with-an-invisible-stitch.html) method.

So I am wondering if there is anyone out there who has used either/both of these methods who can give me some pros and cons. I dont mind that the slip stich is visible from the back but I do mind if i get unsightly ridges or awkward edges at the front.

[Here]( http://imgur.com/Vx1xfsr) is a pic of my progress :) 





























 You know who I mean. That one celebrity everyone hates that you think is smokin hot. You can't bring yourself to admit your nasty feelings to your friends, so tell Reddit instead. No judgement here, friend. 














 I am very new to crocheting and after bravely setting out to make a nice throw using 12ply yarn, I quickly discovered I was out of my depth. My throw started as a scarf, but I found it was too stiff with the 12ply so I carried on widening it, making a throw. 

I went out and bought heaps of the yarn I was using so I didn't run out, thinking I was a genius for stockpiling it.

But halfway through I realised my throw was just as stiff as my scarf...so I unravelled it.

Now, I am stuck with about 5 HUGE balls of purple 12ply yarn and neither the skills nor the knowledge to turn it into something useful.

So can anyone help me out with suggestions for a basic pattern I can use to get rid of all this yarn? Everything I try seems too intricate for it's thickness, or requires various colours when all I have is the purple... 






















































 Sure, what she did was hard, no denying that and attention on women's health is usually a good thing. But the media needs to stop glorifying sick celebrities. It portrays them as the benchmarks and 'poster-children' for a disease when, as wealthy and famous individuals with access to almost endless medical resources, they are in the best possible position while sick. 

Common people, like struggling single mothers and embattled pensioners have more reason to be called inspirations than celebrities. 

Furthermore, the media lauding these famous people as inspirations creates unrealistic expectations for normal people coping with the same situations. 












































 Personally, I always had an image of Ginny in my head that looked just like this:

I live in Croydon, so would like a team near there. Any night suits. I am of average skill and fitness, in it just for fun :) 














 I just moved into a new house and I now have a whole cupboard just for crochet! 
It is a double-door wardrobe, with only a shelf up top and no cross beam for hanging, so I need to fit it out myself.

So, show off your organisational skillz here people! I wanna see inside your cupboards and get some ideas :)

 I keep seeing happy predictions, but more often it is the dark things that we remember more.

 New to Melbourne, I recently had to give up my regular Stitch 'n Bitch crochet circle...so I am looking to make a new one!

I am thinking that a city park would be a great meet-point as it will be a sunny 28 on Sunday. I will be temporarily at Camberwell (usually in Croydon) but don't really know the area, so I am open to suggestions. If we were to make it a regular thing, we would need to decide on a more permanent spot.

So is anyone keen? I don't mind if you are a bare beginner, as I have taught a few of my friends before. I am just looking to enjoy the great company of fellow hookers :P

 I just moved to Victoria from Queensland, and bought a house out at Croydon. In the meantime, I am staying with family at Ringwood.

Locals keep suggesting that Ringwood and Croydon are unsavory areas, which confuses me, as they seem lovely.

I am starting to think these people don't have a good grasp on what mkes somewhere truly scummy. 

These people need to go on up to QLD; spend some time at Sunshine, Caboolture or Nambour stations THEN talk to me about scum.

Am I wrong here? 









 Today is my first day exploring the city after moving here from QLD. I am at Flinders St station and need suggestions for lunch!

Any food type, so long as it is tasty. Probably would prefer to sit and eat. 




 Yesterday we arrived after driving all the way from Brissy. 

I am exhausted now, but once I am feeling human again I will want to start enjoying this fab city. Currently, I am based in Ringwood, but will move soon with plans to buy in the same area.

If anyone has any general advice, offers of friendship or suggestions of cool places, I'd love to hear them! I need some friends, a gym, a hobby, sports, all the stuff I left behind.

I am a 24, female Medical Scientist. I love books, bike rides, fashion, tasty sweets, netball and crochet. I am chatty and energetic, love going shopping, and am always good for a conversation. 

Has anyone got a casual netball team they need players for?

Or a crochet circle that needs another hooker?

Can't wait to start enjoying my new home! 














 Married to single?

Childless to parent?

Jobless bum to multimillionaire?

What has changed for you? 














 I know most people I talk to say that everything is different once you have your own kids, but I want to see if there are any ladies for whom this did not happen.

I just am starting to think about having kids soon but worry about my almost complete disinterest in almost every child I meet. I love my neices enough to spend large amounts of time with them, but they are the only exception and I am usually very relieved to return them to their mum afterwards.

I know women are meant to be all maternal and stuff, but I just worry that I haven't got what it takes. 

Has anyone else been in this situation but had kids anyway? Did it change?

Sorry, if this is the wrong place to ask this. 














 There is that one customer that will always haunt your dreams. Be it because of pure gross factor, scariness, annoying behaviour or just hilariously angry

 I was in a hardware store the other day, looking for some timber for a project.
A little old man was in the same aisle, shuffling along while I looked over my choices, making sure they were straight.

As he came past me he leant in and said "You must be a carpenter, you look like you know what you are doing!"

I laughed and told him I wasn't but did know what I was doing.

At first I wondered the implications of what he said: That I must only know what I was doing if I was a carpenter. Why couldn't I not do carpentry as a trade and still know what I was doing?

But then I realised how uncommon it was for an elder man to make the assumption that I was a carpenter. Usually I would expect the assumption that my husband was one and I was running errands for him. He saw me as a strong, independant woman capable of doing a trade for a living.

It is something small and inconsequential, but it made me smile. I appreciated him for seeing me as woman, not a wife/girlfriend, and one who was perfectly capable of doing a "man's trade".

 Hi Docs.

About a year or two ago I suddenly developed tinnitus. I was lying down in bed one night and my ears were roaring like I had just been to a concert. It was sudden, with my night before being normal and quiet. No injury or event happened that day as far as I can recall.

And it never went away.

Every night my ears roar and it makes it difficult to sleep because the world isn't silent.

During the day I get sporadic bursts of ringing/deafness in one ear. Sometimes it is so high pitched it causes me pain.

But lately something has changed. I hear noises that aren't there. It is most apparent when I am at work, late at night on a Call In and no one else is around.

I hear phones ringing, footsteps, doors closing and the distinctive tinkle of a bell that one lady likes to wear on her keys.

I brought it up at work once and everyone looked at me like I was crazy. I thought it was just my brain filling in the silence and figured it was normal.

So, is it normal? Do I reason to be concerned?

24 f Healthy weight, no medications aside from an Implanon which is a very recent change (2-3 months), non smoker, no other health issues 




 What do you have to deal with on a day-to-day basis that you are sure isn't a concern for the general population. 

I am interested in seeing what others have to overcome daily so I might better appreciate my lucky lot in life.

 I have lived in QLD my whole life, but my husband is a Melbournite through and through. 

After living in Queensland for 6 years, he was keen to move back home and I have happily agreed. Goodbye Brisbane, Hello Melbourne. More specifically, NorthEastern suburbian Melbourne.

We make the move in a month and while I am moving with a local, one who knows a lot of ins and outs, I am keen to learn as much as I can for myself. Good cafes, crap suburbs, best hairdressers, etc.

So, sell yourself to me Melbourne, you minx. 









 Other mythologicl creatures to play a part in the final books?

Last night I had a bitchin dream that when Dany came to Westeros astride her dragon, with her two riders by her side, they were met in the air by Aegon and Co riding griffins. Awesome aerial battle ensued.

Now, we know dragons exist, giants, ice spiders and possibly unicorns do too but what other creatures could we plausibly expect to see, and do we really think that any of them would have a play in the final battles?

Be as tinfoilly as you want, I am just kicking around the Ideas Ball. 



















 Ok, so I was playing social netball tonight and we were losing. Normally, I don't care a whole lot about the score because I am in it for the fitness but tonight, it was bothering me. I was getting frustrated that the ref was making a lot of petty calls against our team and ignoring them when the other team did the same thing. On top of this, their centre was constantly getting in my girls' faces and contacting them subtly so the stupid ref couldn't see.

I got sick of it, so I started sticking to her like glue. Wherever she went, I was on her. She started getting irate. Then, when I had my back to her trying to block her, she bumped against me to obviously draw a foul against me. Ref didn't see, so I bumped back.

She responded by slapping me *hard* on the arse!

I was like "wtf did you just slap me on the butt?!"

She denied it, of course. I pressed and said she did. Then she said it was an accident. The ref took her side and said it was just a general contact; part of the play. 

I spun on him and said "I know what a fucking slap on the arse feels like!"

 He threatened to send me off the court, to which I said "fine, if she goes!"

She wouldn't go and wouldn't admit anything. I called her out on her physical playing and she just stared. The ref was weak and once I showed him I wasn't getting off the court he just told the girl to apologise...which she wouldn't.

The whole situation ended with me just telling them to continue playing. The ref, the idiot, didn't try to resolve the issue and just allowed play to continue.

Later, when I looked at my cheeks, sure enough, there was a big red hand print. 
 
The whole thing made me a lot madder than it should have, but I just couldn't believe she had the nerve to deny it, then to say it was an accident and than have the ref take her side. Like I said, I know when I have been slapped! Don't tell me what I felt!


I know this is petty and juvenile and not worth reading probably, but I just needed to vent and this seemed like the place to do it.

If you read it, thanks and I'm sorry for a probably boring story

 And I can't believe it took me 24 years to watch it!!!

What a mastetpiece! It truly is a classic, in all senses of the word. The costumes, the sets, the music and Vivian Leigh!!! She floored me. She is so beautiful and powerful in that role. It made me so happy to have Scarlett as my namesake. She isn't nice, she isn't selfless...but she is *strong* and determined to have what she wants, and that made me love her. Yes, she was a fool when it came to love, but I guess that is what love does to us. It can make a fool of even the strongest of people.

The movie was an emotional rollercoaster and I loved every moment of it.

I stayed up til midnight to watch it and will be tired tomorrow but, frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.

 As a book reader, I knew Sansa's mockingbird transformation was on the cards, so it felt nice and natural to me. 

Although, I have the benefit of having her inner dialogue in my memory to supplement the scenes in the show.

So, tell me, did it feel natural to you? Was her badass transformation expected or did it feel contrived in any way? There was only really a few minutes of actual screentime between Meek Sansa and Badass Sansa, so I wonder if that was enough... 




 I only discovered this sub yesterday, so forgive me if this has been asked before.

 I am captain of an amateur women's netball team called the Mix-Ups and we are in need of some players.

We play every monday night at Toombul Indoor Centre with games starting between 6:00 - 8:15pm. 

It isn't a high-skill competition and we are all just in it for the exercise. Your skills can be old, rusty or non-existant; we don't mind as long as you have the enthusiasm!

Games are $14 each and that covers court hire, ref hire and sports insurance.

If you are keen, we have a game on monday night at 6pm. No commitment required. Just have a try and see if you like it :)

 Hey Docs.

For a few years now I was under the impression that I had asthma. A doc in uni diagnosed me even after a few inconclusive tests (normal blood O2, good lung capacity, no lesuons in chest x-ray, no wheezing).

 I do have low stamina for cardio, I get short of breath at times when it really doesn't seem like I should ( laying down for bed, watching TV) and I have had two 'attacks' (both while doing exercise). A puffer helps but I don't feel immediate relief, it usually takes a while.

It has gotten to the point where I am almost always short of breath and have to make an effort to take a good deep breath. I rarely feel satisfied after a yawn and I find myself trying desperately to suck in a little bit more air just to feel like I have enough.

It is really starting to get to me and I have spoken to a GP and he says it is psychological and I am just getting myself worked up which makes it worse. Is he right?

 No Spoilers, to be safe.

For my birthday this year, I asked my dad for the Game of Thrones bookset. 

My father is a wonderful man, but has sometimes given me reasons to question his judgement...or at least his thought processes.

 One Christmas I wanted a copy of The Da Vinci Code that had all the pictures of the churches in it (I love Roman architecture). He couldn't find it, so he gave me a book of Da Vinci's writings and drawings.

Close enough.

Another year I asked for a hammock. I told him specifically the one I wanted and where to get it. He got me one completely different and not really what I was hoping for, but it had stripes like the one I pointed out so I just didn't have the heart to fault him on it.

One time, just randomly he bought me a spellbook. I have no idea why, it wasn't my birthday. To this day I have never read it.

Anyway, all of these things have been funny little events that lead to me possessing things I never thought I would, and me appreciating my dad just for the effort he puts in.


But this birthday, I was serious. I wanted that bookset. I needed it. So, I gave my dad very clear instructions. I told him Game of Thrones bookset. It is *this* big, *this* much money and you can buy it from *this* shop.

Noticed my mistake yet?

So my poor dad went off in search of The Game of Thrones bookset. He went to the shop and looked around. He looked and looked and looked. Finally, after what he said was about half an hour he gave up. He headed over to a table in middle of the shop. He picked up a big set of books and took a quick glance at the back. 

Dragons, knights, Queens and intrigue.

"This sounds like something YoureNotaGenius would read, I will get her this seeing as I can't find what she wants." And so he did.

Fast forward to my birthday and as I opened my present I noticed a look of apprehension my dad's face. I shrugged it off and kept opening.

I must have missed the look of confusion he surely would have had afterwards when I jumped up and gave him a hug, crying "Oh dad, it is *perfect*! Just what I wanted. Thank you so much!"

He finally got one right, and that was purely by chance.

 It is so humbling to have the parents of these kids think so much of our handmade gifts to bury their children with them. 

Thank you for sharing your story! It is both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time 




 I did stop! Somwonw else must be doing it :P

Best wishes for your nephew and I hope he gets well soon. Amigarumi toys make the best gifts! And they are easier than yiu would think. I only learnt to crochet about 2 years ago 




 I love crochet squids! I think one of those is going to be my next little project 




 Thanks. Keeping my fingers crossed fpr your niece 




 I am so sorry about your sister. But it is wonderful for you to spend your time making gifts that come from the heart for people in those situations 




 Thank you. I hopw your little one is doing OK now 




 What a heartbreaking story! Thanks for sharing. I hope that teddy brings you nothing but good memories and I am sure your sister would appreciate the blanket more knowing its origins 




 Sorry, I'll stop chopping them... 




 I'm sorry for the feels, but thank you :) 




 If only he had the chance to be loved to pieces :(

But I am sorry for the emotion avalanche. I just wanted to put this story out there and share it with people who truly understand 




 Thank you :)  




 Thanks :) 




 Man, I cried just writing this. It has been a hard couple of weeks. But things like this that I can think about make it a little easier. He was so adorable, and I am not biased at all! http://i.imgur.com/SfIHGvT.jpg 




 What's the rent like? 




 Earlier in the year I made an elephant for my newborn nephew. He was hands down the best amigarumi I had ever done: http://imgur.com/a/Sz1zZ.

My Sister in Law and her husband loved him and they were sure that as he grew up, my nephew would love him too.

However, my nephew was not a healthy baby. He was born with a very rare congenital bowel defect and was whisked off to intensive care the moment he was born. A few days after he came into the world, my husband and I met our newest family member and I was so excited to give him his little elephant. His mother gave him pride-of-place in my nephew's crib, nestled amongst the tubes and monitor wires near his tiny head.

It was such a bittersweet sight, seeing my tiny nephew railing himself against the defect he was born with whilst cuddling with a toy that I made so lovingly for him.

Unfortunately, like many stories, this one turned more bitter than sweet in the end.

After a heroic 6 week long struggle for life, my nephew passed away. His parents were with him...and so was his elephant. 

The funeral was heartbreaking. My nephew's coffin was so tiny, and looked even smaller in my brother-in-laws arms as he carried it into the chapel. I almost couldn't bear it...until my sister in law told me not to worry, because his elephant was in there with him. 

He loved his elephant, she told me, and he will be taking it with him into the next world. She asked if I was ok with that, and through my tears I was able to tell her that nothing would cheer me up more than knowing he wasn't alone in there. I made that elephant for him, no matter what.

My nephew was cremated the next day with his little elephant by his side. Although we are all now left with a gaping hole in our lives, I have at least found comfort in knowing that our special little fighter had something soft and loving with him til the end.


Sorry for the feel trip guys, but I just wanted to share this story with people I knew would appreciate it and understand.


Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words. The pain of losing him hasn't lessened over time, but I am getting better at handling it. Bonus pic of my nephew telling us all to live with peace in our hearts: http://imgur.com/fsDnE65 




 *their? 









 And his wife? 




 Given the choice, I would rather not watch football, talk about fishing or play Xbox. But my husband enjoys those things, so I got involved with them too
 I picked a football team to follow, I got a fishing rod of my own and I learnt how to play COD. I do those things so I could spend time with him while doing them. I understand that this isn't realistic for all couples, but I just feel like if a partner has to lie or decieve the other one in order to find the time to do something they enjoy then there is a problem.

If I found out my husband was doing something like this (I am making the assumption that the wife knows nothing here) I would be disappointed in myself for being the type of wife that needs to be lied to. 




 Thank goodness. I thought I was doing it wrong there for a sec. I was thinking I would have to start forbidding gaming, withholding blowjobs and complaining about sports 




 Am I a strange wife for letting my husband play computer games if he wants? Unless we have plans to do things together, I don't care if he sits there and plays them. I am usually off playing one myself, or sitting there crocheting and watching him play 




 Damn! Imagine if this was an Olympic event! 




 Poo. 




 I just moved to Melbourne recently and I get the vibe that Flinder's St Station is seen as a major icon of the city, but to me it just isn't at the standard I expected. If it looked like that proposed design, it would be a splendid icon. It would be awesome and people would probably see it in the same light at the Opera House and flock to see it.

That being said, I would really rather not have to have a system where every now and then it takes me 3 hours to get home.  




 Man, look at that shitty photoshop. The river has never been that blue! At least make it realistic! 




 Instead, lift your knees a little by going up onto the balls of your feet while you sit. Not the same as squatting, but you'll have less broken rims

 That is the type of yawn/stretch combo that leaves you thinking "hell yeah...that was a good one." 




 Warning though: Give your machine a rinse with vinegar before washing clothes with it. It gets soap scum off your barrel really well...and right onto your clothes 




 I have heard vinegar works well

 Hey I totally agree...it sucks. But mine was actually a health issue. I was constantly getting painful, somwtimes infected ingrown hairs. I tried EVERY trick in the book: shaving, waxing, trimming, oils, creams, oitments with no relief.

It was also a source of constant embarrassment for me, so me paying that much money was 100% worth it. It has given me so much confidence. I can actually wear a bikini now!!!

I would also like to point out that laser is permanent. i will never have to wax agaim. That is $40 month for the rest of my life saved right there 




 I saw results after 1 session. I am now 3 sessions in and i have gone from shaving once a day and still having stubble to shaving once a week IF I remember. The hair is now light and wispy. 

I was one of those people who was a perfect candidate: dark hair, light skin, quick growing hair, so my results were bound to be good. 

I also got my bikini done which was the same story of coarse, dark hair and sensitive skin. I hadn't worn a bikini without boardshorts EVER but now, I am so happy to strut it.

All up I paid $740 for a years worth of treatment for both under arm and bikini, and with it only halfway done I am already feeling like it was worth every penny 




 I know this is probably not the kind of answer you are looking for, but I had terrible problems with shaving under my arms. My skin got so irritated, it got really pigmented and scarred.

So I got lazer hair removal and it is hands down the best decision I ever made. I am 6 months in, my skin is smooth, healing and I am no longer ashamed of lifting my arms in public.

100% recommend it! 

Plus, the price may seem steep at first but there are groupons available, payment plans, ete 




 I'm in Croydon South...it is pretty nice here :/  




 Meh. I'm a bookreader 




 I would still like to stretch them out over time. Why blow your load in one night when you can make the joy stretch out over weeks and weeks? 




 I decided to watch the first ep, but wait for the next 3. Otherwise I am just dooming myself to a month long wait for ep 5 




 Thith ith tho thoothing 




 Fun fact! 

I worked in a lab that helped Frazer out with his work. He (or his team) were sloppy at labelling samples and it was my job to go through our liquid nitrogen storage tank and toss out the 20+ year old samples of his that were inappropriately labelled.

Somehow I felt like I was destroying a part of history...but he was never coming back for them, so it had to be done. 




 I once had a whole carload of them come to our rural, quiet property....on Easter Sunday!....to try to preach to us. I had to run out and shoo them away before my dad could get to them because if he dealt with them it would not have been pretty. 




 My dad answered the door naked once.

He was never bothered again. 









 So let it faaaaaalllll

 My husband and I split our chores 50/50. I appreciate him, he appreciates me. simple, really.

I also can't help but think that the "she leaves her family for you, moves in with you" is utter crap. Unless you live with his parents, he did the same thing! 




 Nope.

 I just don't get what this post is trying to achieve. Firstly, this isn't the 50's, women don't "give up everything" for their man, and secondly, who is saying that men aren't appreciative? It just seems like stirring up crap with no actual reason for it.

Sorry for screenshot! 




 I could almost guarantee no one would give a crap if this was in Australia 




 Same here!!! I had no clue til I found this sub.

And just look at me now, Ma! Moving up in the world!! 




 I haven't blocked any blankets I have made, but I do give them a wash before gifting them and that seems to be enough 




 Actually this pattern was only worked in rows, so I am not sure! 




 This took a lot less effort than you think. I wet the doily then laid out a towel on my carpet and pinned it down. Waited a day then voila!  




 Also made it heaps bigger! :D 




 Thanks :) 




 If it is still in packaging, I would think a hospital would take it? I dunno.

 It is corner to corner box stitch. 
The yarns are just a collection of soft acrylic DKs I had stashed in my cupboard...all the cards are thrown out now sorry :/

Also, thanks :)

 I am using a combo of DK yarns from my local craft store. I just grabbed whatever felt soft and was in the right colours. The stitch is a Corner to Corner Box stitch. I posted a pic of what it actually looks like from afar.

I am not using any specific pattern tho 




 Ha ha! Completely reasonable...and useful! 




 Fun Fact: We have a footballer here in Aus called Karmichael Hunt. I am sure he cops it a lot 




 Hey! That looks great. Still haven't got around to blocking mine yet :/

 Because I'm feeling particularly self-righteous this evening, I wrote an email to the local prosecutor named on the docket for this case. And because posting it publicly makes me feel more important, here it is:


I love your honesty. 

Also, thumbs up on the letter. I feel the same as you when faced with something as ~~ludacris~~ ludicrous (I'm so sorry!) as this; overwhelmed with the burning desire to get involved

 Corner to Corner Box stitch. Super easy and quick! I have since added 3 more colours, all greens 




 I am hoping I can ride the wave until at least it is big enough to be a shawl. Also, thanks :) 




 Was thinking of making it a blanket but that could change over time :P 

Deends on how quickly the new project feeling wears off

 After telling people I (a female) work in a hospital.

"Oh, are you a nurse?"

Bitch, I could be the head of neurosurgery. Don't just assume that since I am female and work in a hospital that I can only be a nurse.

I'm not actually head of neurosurgery, I am a Medical Scientist 




 That's some specious reasoning 









 Dat widdle paw lick! 




 To be honest I am not totally certain of cancer risks. I think it does all the depend on the cancer and if they are due to external or genetic risk factors.

Also, once you go through the first blood test you will go through a few more rounds of testing. You have to be crossmatched against the recipient a few times, and have confirmatory testing done too. We like to make sure we are 100% sure before ripping your organs out :P

As for the surgery itself, sorry I can't speak for that part...i am just a scientist
 




 I work in the lab that handles only the Histocompatibility, which we determine from blood. 

Each person has a "Tissue Type" which they inherit from their parents. That refers to a cluster of molecules called the Major Histocompatibility Complex. Essentially, these molecules help the body's immune system determine self from non-self. When you are being tested for compatibility, you are being tested to see what MHC molecules you have and whether they are the same as the recipient.

Now, in Solid organ donation, your Tissue Type is not the most important thing. You can still donate if you are not a match. Is it the case that just being the right blood group can mean you could donate. To explain this simply, the recipient is going to be on immunosupressants, that the body can't really recognise self from not self anyway.

That being said, doctors will try to match you as best as possible. Because a good matched organ is leas likely to cause the recipient to develop antibodies.

When your body is challenged with something foreign, it can develop antibodies against it, which will attack that thing the next time it enters your body.

Kidney recipients are usually very sick. They gets lots of transfusions. Transfusing blood challenges that person with something foreign, and they develop antibodies. Not all of these antibodies matter to us at Histocompatibility. We only care if they are antibodies that would specifically attack the organ we are trying to put in. We call those Donor Specific Antibodies. 

A recipient with no antibodies at all (unsensitised) would have a MUCH better chance than a person who has lots and lots of antibodies (sensitised) and if that person has lots and lots of DSAs, matching can be almost impossible.

For that reason and for those people, Typing becomes very important.

A sensitised patient could have so many DSAs that only 5% of the population would have a Typing that could "slip through the gaps" and be both compatible and not under the DSA umbrella. 

Once you take into account size, donor health, waiting time, etc a person could find themselves waiting a very very long time for that 1 in 10 person to match them.

Edit: I am on mobile so sorry if this is a bit garbled 




 I work in a lab that tests for compatability for Transplantations (not in the US). I can give you insight to the actual test, what it means to be compatible, and why kidneys can be so very difficult to match, if you are interested?

Edit: and the other misc objects around his face 




 My newborn nephew is in the Royal Children's Hospital, a month after being born with a rare bowel defect. His parents have just been told to expect their tiny fighter to remain there for 6-12 months. My heart is breaking for them, and I want to do something to support them, but don't know how.

Does anyone know which charities are best to help parents in this situation? They live local to the hospital, so accomodation isn't the issue. I just worry for their mental and emotional states and want to find someone who can help me make their lives a little easier.

Thanks 




 My husband dropped that one on me last night and I flipped my lid. I am nowhere near my time, so for me, having him say that was very hurtful. It showed a complete lack of respect for my feelings. It felt dismissive; as if any problem I had with him was only because I was full of hormones and thus not worth his time. I told him how very hurtful it was but he says he doesn't regret it.

Am I overreacting?

This is assuming reproduction is still possible, of course. 





























 For this moment in time, you are the sole reason for all these people to take the energy to think and type out nice things. You are central in their minds and all they want to do is make you smile.

 Yeah, I was getting an asshole vibe from him, which is why I shut it down. No point in getting into arguments with people like that 




 I just don't understand your problem, so I am not going to bother.

You seem to have me pidgeon-holed as some man-hating feminist, and if you can jump to that conclusion after reading 2 posts then you can have fun with the rest of your judgemental life. I sure as hell wont be taking anything you have said to heart, or even remembering it when I wake up tomorrow. 




 I am going to assume that you have not experienced any of the type of catcalling I am referring to.

That single occasion wasn't the only time I have experienced something like that. I have been called a slut because I didn't respond to one man. I have been told I am ugly anyway because I didn't respond to another. 

So excuse me if I make a few assumptions about men who call out to women on the street. They aren't all out to rape me, but even if it is just a wolfwhistle, it is very clear that they just don't understand how stressed out it can make women feel. What if that simple appreciate wolfwhistle I ignore is just the prelude to something more horrible? I stick by my saying "most men" because if you are a man, you would have little idea of what it is like to have strangers ogle you, call out to you, or whistle at you since you were 13 years old almost *every* time you walk down the street. I have spoken to people about this and it is common for men I speak to about it to brush it off, calling it a compliment. I did not say most men DO call out, and I did not say most men threaten to rape me, I said most men think the mild forms of catcalling are OK. If this generalisation offends you then...well that's not my problem.

On top of this, I really don't appreciate you telling me "I hope you don't have sons". I probably will have sons and I will certainly make a point of teaching them what behaviours I feel are unacceptable, which I feel includes any kind of public singling-out of women based purely on their looks.

For the record, I never once went on about "the patriarchy, the patriarchy", "rape culture" or "male privilege". I simply shared my personal experiences. They aren't wrong and you can try all you like to dismiss them, but I will use them to teach my children what is acceptable and what is not. If you think that will mess them up, then I don't want to think about what you will teach yours

 Morticia was my mum's idol. She used to dress like her, act like her, she even had the cane chair and would sit exclusively in it during dinner parties.

 Maybe so. I would not say most men do it, but I would say that an awful lot wouldn't see the wolfwhistling and shouts as inappropriate 




 I haven't seen much of the promos, but I did watch a news piece on them and was amused by the people who objected because the doco was "unflattering" to the town. 

Reality isn't meant to flatter, it just is. You can't sprinkle glitter on a turd and call it a diamond. If parts of your town are as bad as this doco makes them seem, then serious change needs to happen...and I am not talking about the show producers 




 Great read.

Time and time again it just floors me that most men think it is OK to shout things at women, even if they have a wife, gf, sister or daughter.

I was getting catcalls early in my teens because of my big chest, even when I was in school uniform. At first I was flattered, then annoyed, then eventually I found out what happened if I ignored these men...I was threatened.

Once, I was walking home from uni and was catcalled by a neighbor down the street. I ignored him...so he threatened to rape me.

What. The. Fuck?

I had to change my walking pattern home. I usually walked through a park with little lighting because it saved me 15mins...but I had to change that because some fat wank didn't get his ego stroked when I ignored his caveman-like advances.

It makes me sick, and I hope to one day have sons and show them just how horrifying this behaviour is. Maybe change will come eventually. 




 IMHO, you are an asshat

 One time, sitting out the front of my house in rural Queensland Australia, I was absentmindedly staring at the trees across my yard when suddenly, one of the branches moved.

For some stupid reason my brain instantly decided there was a monkey in our tree, but then I remembered I was in Australia, so it changed and decided it was our cat.

We don't have a cat.

It took one more moment, during which my brain contemplated the possibility of ninjas in our tree before the branch moved again and I realised I was looking at one of [these]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Tawny-frogmouth.jpg).

 A comment I wrote a while ago to another post:


One day, my husband and I were out the front of our house when a little streak of white came out of nowhere and disappeared under our car. After a little bit of coaxing and calling, I pulled out the smallest, most frightened ball of fluff ever. Poor little pup was shaking so bad. He didn't have a collar on, and he was so cute and frightened I instantly decided that he was mine. My husband, however, was more practical and insisted I take him to a vet to check for a chip. Reluctantly, I did, and unfortunately there was a chip. It was registered to an address right around the corner from ours.

With a heavy heart and an armful of wiggly, fluffy puppy I went home and then set off down the street. As I turned the corner I saw a girl in her mid teens sitting out the front of her house, crying. As I walked up she looked at me and then her face lit up with the most joyous smile. With no hesitation I handed back the fluffball and the girl burst out with tears of joy.

Man, I wish I could have kept that puppy, but no amount of tiny puppy kisses were worth having to see a heartbroken girl mourning the loss of her new friend. 

TLDR, found puppy, found microchip, found joy in returning it to its owner

 My husband scared me the other day by coming home early, while I was in the middle of vaccuming. I didn't know he was in the house until I turned around and saw him standing in the doorway of the room I was in.

My immediate reaction? I screamed and fell to the floor.

Yeah, great reflexes there train_subject889. You'll do real well in the Zombie Apocolypse

 Potato gems. 

If there is a person in this world who doesn't like potato gems...I don't want to know them! 




 That would make a good swaddle 




 My husband would probably react by punching the thing that scared him like this, so it would end badly for me 




 I asked God why he took my mother away from me...and no one answered 




 I throw in some variety when I do it:

Take him as deep as you can and hum

Massage the bottom of the shaft with your tongue as you suck

Give his balls some attention. Fondle, tickle, or even just cup them

Put your hands on his hips and rub/massage him or pull him towards you

 I suppose it would be better to just get a bop on the head when you break a bone and wake up when the morphine has kicked in.

 A girl I know fractured her ankle playing netball and was crying and vomiting with pain. It took 2 cute paramedics and a morphine whistle to get any kind of calm about her. 

I hope never to break a bone. 




 I haven't even broken a bone or had a baby yet, so I have a feeling I don't actually know what real pain is

 My husband likes to fondly call me Cunt Rocket.

And when he is asking me if I want to get some drinks, he asks me if I am getting on the cunt tonight.

Our relationship is weird 




 I admit, it wasn't continuous work...I had a few breaks but yeah, it is just part of my work. 

I am a Transplant Scientist. We do the workups for Cadaveric Organ Donors and like last night, we can often have 2 donors in one night (a single donor takes about 7 hours). I was On Call and that means I work my normal 8 hours and then if any donors come that night, I do them too. 

So I left for work at 6:45am on Wed and got home at 8 this morning...and slept til 4.

 This was what struck me first. With all the quiet, mysterious dignity the priests of the many-faced god possess, I am sure it would come crashing down each time they have to wrangle out the big ladder. I just imagine them yelling at eachother, trying to coordinate a big pole with a hook on it which they use to get the faces at the tippy-top.

"No Hank! The other old lady! The one with the big-ass mole."

"I can't bloody see the mole Bill, it's dark as shit up here!"

 Just calling 'em like I sees 'em. I'm sure you have many other redeeming qualities...burliness, for example.

Just don't come to Australia though...it is actually illegal here for a fisherman to catch a carp and release it again. They are supposed to kill them on site  




 This works because carp are [ugly mofos](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Carpe_miroir_de_17kg.jpg) 




 In Melbourne it is free, and you are allowed to park on the footpath as long as it isn't blocking the way

Edit: I have no idea how :( 




 No idea. I assumed he could do it when he reposted. It is exactly the same as his title, so maybe it just does that? I honestly did not write it 




 Mine too. Mind you, in most cases my car could barely achieve 1km over the speed limit. 




 *sigh* yes. He clearly did it to draw people to my post and start berating me...which is exactly what happened.

If you feel the need to go on about hypocrisy I suggest you go to his repost and tell him all about it. https://www.reddit.com/r/melbournecirclejerk/comments/368zpu/spotted_another_privileged_bourgeois_child/

I do not feel that I have been hypocritical in my comments 




 It is my picture. This is my original post. Sixteen_kebabs reposted 




 OMG. Ok let me explain this clearly.

I took the picture. I posted it to r/melbourne. U/sixteen_kebabs reposted my pic with that caption in r/melbournecirclejerk.

SO...when you criticize the "person who took the picture" you are criticizing me...when I have made no mention of having an iPhone 




 That's not my caption! sixteen_kebabs reposted my picture with that caption 




 Save room for your door 




 If you have been linked here from /r/melbournecirclejerk know this: I DID NOT WRITE THAT CAPTION! 




 Oh, I see. Someone from /r/Melbournecirclejerk has linked you here.

I DID NOT write that caption! 




 Can I clarify that I never initially meant this to be about the bank account of the car owner. As my title suggests, I was merely referring to the *power* of the car and expressing my feeling that a Learner probably shouldn't be at the wheel of something with so much oompf.

I am perfectly aware that rich kids need to learn and their parents' car is usually the most available car. I am not specifically attacking the wealthy. If this were a turbo skyline or a massive V8 I would have the same qualms. I feel that driving a car with power should come later in life, not when you are still learning.

I am not sure where this "exploiting labour'' comment came from either. I never once wrote that

 




 I don't understand where that quote is coming from...I never wrote that 




 Where does the original person claim to be using an iPhone and where does it say that they were complaining about using the exploits of labour? Are we reading the same comments?

I did take the pic...with my Galaxy S5. I was merely trying to point out that a Learner driver probably shouldn't be driving such a powerful car. I wasn't trying to make this about people's wealth 




 Uhh no.

I have a Galaxy...which I paid for myself, and unless you are sitting in a cave Redditing via smoke signals, you can't say much about people using technology.

Edit: Pay attention to usernames people! The comment he referred to is not mine, hence my confusion 




 I wasn't meaning difficult 




 I don't buy drugs tho.... 




 You not being in it would be a good start. 




 Says the person trying to convince me that I am wrong 




 Keep trying 




 For a person claiming not to be dumb you sure are making a good show of it 




 Yeah...I don't have a Daewoo. What a terrible attempt to be a wanker 




 I agree with you mostly. You can't automatically assume that an owner of a car with power is a bad driver, but putting a bad driver in a car with lots of power it a very bad idea. It usually makes a bad driver worse.  




 Well I am not sure if a Learner was actually behind the wheel of this one but it was roaring off and weaving through traffic like most idiots who own too much power. If it was a Learner he has bad habits already, and if it was the owner then he certainly doesn't seem like he will be teaching his child the proper road rules if he can't use them himself. 




 I was wondering that about Learners. Stupid rule 




 What kind of person trusts a 16 year old with that much power? That is a very fast way to lose your car and your Learners permit

Hijacking my top comment to point out that the title you all see is not my original title. I did not write it. Imgur automatically filled in the title after /u/sixteen_kebabs reposted my pic. For further info, see here  https://www.reddit.com/r/melbournecirclejerk/comments/368zpu/spotted_another_privileged_bourgeois_child/. So please stop accusing me of hypocrisy

 No,  just hand done :) 









 I'm on mobile and it was a bit laggy. As the foil got flipped the video cut out and went black. Confused the shit out of me 




 I deliberately misread.


Context: I work at a Transplantation lab. On Call at my work involves coming in and crossmatching blood of a deceased donor with recipients. If I were to misread a result, the wrong recipient could recieve the wrong organ...and could die. If I were to do that deliberately it would be a one-way ticket out the door 




 I know right? I am just crossing my fingers that easy births run in the family 




 None taken. We scientists are a weird lot. Quite a few of us say "huzzah!" when things go well in the lab.  




 I haven't even got kids yet, and I am already looking forward to getting my tubes tied 




 I actually am. I kid you not

 When pregnant with her 3rd, my sister just woke up in the middle of the night and thought "hmm...I think I am in labour." Not wanting to push her luck because her 2nd only took 2 hours they bundled into the car and drove to the hospital (20min drive). She walked up to the counter and told the nurse she was in labour. The nurse, of course, saw no reason to hurry and actually told her to go home. My sister persisted, so they started to walk her down to the birthing suite. After 5 or so steps her waters broke and 7 minutes later my neice was born.

It all happened so quickly my BIL almost missed it. I can only hope I have it that easy when I have bebbehs

 My mum passed in '99 when I was 9. She left my sister and I a letter, full of all her hopes and dreams for us and helpful advice. It was tough reading it, but it made me smile....except at the end.

It was never finished. It just cuts off after a little paragraph about how swearing is for dumb bunnies. She must have died before being able to finish it.

I'll never know what else she intended to say, but I try to live by her words as much as possible.

Except for the swearing thing. Curse words are the spice of life.

 Not really contributing to your point, but I just loved how Dany was "we gon get hitched. No arguments" and Hizzazz Kravitz just stared dumbly. I felt kinda bad for him, like maybe he already had a fiancee and Dany just shat all over their wedding plans 




 I understand that, but instead of validly calling out people on shitty behaviour, half the comments are just about women-hating.
 /r/theredpill is even worse

I just think that things like these just purpetuate the problem. Maybe if men stopped claiming that women only did these things/got away with these things because they are women, instead of just assholes then these women might stop trying to use that as an excuse 




 Right? She is just back where she started, getting hitched to a lunatic...cept now she has some bitchin new threads 




 The hype of last season when she came down the stairs and said "shall we go?". 

Last year everyone thought that was the start of her getting her littlefinger on

 My dad raised my sister and I from early teens after my mum passed. 

One afternoon, a few days after he and I went out for lunch, an acquaintance of his came up to him and said "Who was that hot young thing you were with the other day?"

 I'm going to make the call here and say it was deliberate 




 This makes me so anxious. I want to have kids but I also really really don't want little monsters jumping on my exposed crotch 




 I am female and I have one of those alarms somewhere, but honestly if I heard one going off in my street I would probably ignore it, paying it off as a car alarm or some punk kids. I put zero faith on the thought of someone running to my rescue upon hearing it

 I wasn't trying to take a stab at salaried workers, sorry for making it seem that way. I just know what it is like to have a shitty (casual) retail job and have to stay back...but I did get paid for that time. If yiu don't get paid for 1 or more hours extra work it must suck. An extra 10 mins though, unpaid can't be so bad though 




 I think someone didnt like something I said and is downvoting everything. Ahh well. And nahh, Australia 




 Medical Science, Transplantation. 




 She is a medical scientist 




 That does sound like it sucks, and I am not being sarcastic. But it boggles me to think that you would not.be paid for that time. I have worked 7 retail jobs and not one made me work extra and not paid me for it 




 ...no 




 Exactly right 




 I am 4 years in and I am on $72-78k a year depending on call-ins. 




 We do have a LOT of checks,second checks and safeguards in place. 




 It isn't logistically or financially possible to have it any other way. A very large number of important decisions are made by tired people...but they are foremost professionals. We know what we are doing...even if we dont know what day of the week it is 




 Histocompatibility...but close enough. You know what's up 




 Ok, I will 




 Specifically, look in to Tissue Typing or Histocompatibility if you want to know what I do 




 You do get used to it. I was tired but still pretty functional. I have faith in the results I put out. I am, after all, gambling my career on them being correct 




 We are Med Scientists. On Call at crazy hours is all part of the job. Doctors need results and it ain't machines that give it to them. It is people. The hours are long and hard but we get good $$$ 




 I don't feel like what I said was a complaint. I love my job, I get paid well but the hours are hard sometimes. People who do an easy job with easy hours and complain because they have to stay late with a customer annoy me because they have it easy.

A hard job isn't a horrible job 




 No one is forcing them to do their jobs either... 




 We have 2 people on at once to safeguard from errors. No one had died from human errors.

And to answer your question, there is simply no other way 




 I am required because I am On Call. It is part of the job 




 I didn't bitch. I love my job. I was trying to prove that the other people complaining dont have it half as bad 




 Man, I have really stiff coil over suspension...any bump is Mt Everest for me 




 I had to come into work last night, after working 8 hours, to work for another 10 hours. By the time I got home I had been awake for 27 hours. And the work I do, if you screw up...you could kill someone.

So excuse me if I don't shed a tear for you retail workers who have to work 10 minutes over time because someone needed toilet paper real quick. 

Edit: Of course I get paid well for my time. I work hard in uni, worked hard to get where I am and worked hard to get good pay for overtime. I also worked retail when was young. It was easy but I complained about it because I didn't understand what a difficult job was. I was just trying to point out that if a retail job making you stay back 10 mins is the worst thing in the world for you, no matter the pay, then maybe you aren't cut out for a more stressful job

 I don't believe in many things, so consider yourself lucky! 

As a side note, while I am assuming your name is meant to be "frogger"..I pronounce it "furrgurr" in my head 




 So what about the people with prams that are really easy to set up? Or people who take the spot when the rest of the carpark is available? Or if they decide not use the pram and instead just decide to carry the baby? Or what about all the mothers who take up all the spots leaving other mothers in the lurch?

The point I am trying to make is unless there are clear rules, enforced and punishable you don't have to do shit. The world doesn't owe you anything because you have a pram.

It's not law. It's nice, but not required 




 So what if a woman with no children in her car, just the seats or kids without a pram take it up? Are they cunts too? 




 Just buy a cheap baby seat and chuck it in the back.  




 I knew you were joking :/ 




 I see it more as a guideline.

It's nice to take another spot if you find one, but I sure as shit am not going to drive around for 1/2 an hour and then park on the street because some parent might show up and want it. As with he case of many parents I see park there, they don't even use a pram! Their kids are walking around. Free game I say 




 ...I usually am. If it is just a chuckle you get a "hehe" and just a smile will definitely get you a :) 




 Even if you did it on purpose or not...if they catch you at it you are fault 




 But that's the point...the park spot thing isn't a rule 




 I said in another comment somewhere that I would be interested to see the wording on his page. If it says "will go to charity" he is a scumbag. If it says "help with costs associated with treatment and if some is left over, it will go to charity" you can't get too up in arms. It might have been very losely worded 




 You are totally right...which is why I don't donate unless there is clearly written outlines about where the money is going. Sure a person who lies and pockets the money is a scumbag...but you can't get all in a tizzle if you didn't investigate the "charity" further. 




 Not being a lawyer, I am interested to know how you can show "intent" through losely worded promises. 

It just seems that it would be harder to claim that they were definitely going to donate the money unless it was in writing. Feels like he said, she said.

That's why I thought the wording would be interesting to read. It it clearly says "will go to charity" he hasn't got a leg to stand on 




 It would be interesting to see what the page actually says. Wording is key 




 Big big big piece of information you definitely needed to include.

I still say though that unless this was all in writing or clearly laid out in a way that would be usable in legal action I don't know if there is much to be done.

 Oh man, people I don't know being in my front yard is infuriating! Like, people who park out front so they can visit the neighbours...argh! We start mowing our lawn when they do that. They usually come out and move it pretty quickly 




 I don't see it as stolen if they willingly gave it "for treatment". If she died, she obviously can't get any more treatment but then thar just means the only condition for use of the money is now void. He is under no obligations 




 [What about this one?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/37lwhm/meet_button_she_is_fluffy/) 




 Deserve what? Did they give expecting it to come back and benefit them? Or was the money given under the strict stipulations that it be given back if she died?

If my husband died, I might want a holiday too. Losing a loved one is the worst, supportive friends would understand that grieving takes time...and sometimes money 




 I can't crochet with that sort of racket going on!

 It is. We really only care about skill and effort in our workplace. Of course, in any workplace it is hard to go off and have kids then expect everything to be exactly the same when you return, but it certainly isn't held against you. Because our industry moves and develops at a very quick pace, most women do need retraining to get the back up to speed, but I certainly haven't been denied training because I am married and of childbearing age. They make do with who they have, when they have them, for as long as they have them 




 After my mum died the whole town rallied and had a fundraiser for my dad, sister and I. People need to think morr about the living than the dead in times like that. Who knows what kind of debt her illness left him with. What if he relied on her income? She might not have had health insurance. 
So the money was for treatment...now it'll be for the funeral costs, medical expenses and helping this dude actually move on with his broken life. 

If there was fine print to all those peoples' generosity and he has broken that, then fine....but personally you would have to be heartless to ask for him to give it up 




 I haven't actually...but the Med Science industry is about 70:30 women to men. Even people going on maternity leave aren't screwed over. Helps having all female bosses at least

 Most people on this thread seem to have forgotten their childhoods 




 Santa, Easter Bunny, wash behind your ears or you'll grow potatoes, don't watch TV or your eyes will go square...most things adults lie to kids about are meant for fun or with good intentions.

 Hindsight, of course, teaches us many things, especially the consequences of bad decisions. But the point I was trying to make (and other people in the thread) is that it should have been clear to her that Sydney Road is way too busy to use a child's trailer on. I didn't call her a bad parent and I didn't say she deserved it, I just said it was a fair statement to make. 

Of course, saying that she shouldn't have been on Sydney Rd doesn't help her now, but it is what people are thinking. Maybe if she was thinking to do it again, or someone else, the reaction here might convince them to reconsider that choice. 




 I don't understand the point of that argument

 Because if I do something unsafe in a place where unsafe things can lead to accidents, then I must take some of the blame.

But I do something safe, such as wear a miniskirt and some douche decides to rape me on purpose, then I cannot be blamed.

A rape victim can't change her actions to disuade a rapist...rapists gonna rape. She can't be blamed because he is a horrible POS.

Do you see women in dark alleys and think to yourself "What a stupid woman walking around here...I might rape her"?  




 Yes, because the two senarios are totally comparable

 Good...gather them all in one spot. Easier to get them all at once 




 Ok now you are just being silly 




 I read once that rape victims enjoy rape fantasies because this time *they* are in control. They call the shots, they know how much they want or don't want. It is all about putting the power back in their hands.

To feel emotional about real rape is completely normal in the same instance. It isn't fun when it's real

 This makes me wonder...you know when you see those parents chasing a laughing toddler all over the place desperately trying to catch them? I wonder if you would be able to train your child to freeze on command by constantly playing that game where you yell FREEZE! and everyone has to stop in their tracks? They would eventually get used to freezing when you yell and would do it when you are trying to catch them.  




 For flowers, I would suggest finding someone crafty to make you some if you are into that sort of thing, or even just looking into store-bought bouquets. Some quite pretty little bunches can be bought for under $10 each

 My husband was at the Dept of Transport (aka DMV) one day when a car pulled into the carpark, swung into a spot and just kept going. The car hit the concrete barrier, went over it and got jammed up on it. The wheels were off the ground, but the driver still chucked it in reverse and floored it. Funnily enough, nothing happened. The guy got out of his car and husband said he was the tiniest, most feeble old man he had ever seen. He stood there scratching his head for a moment then went inside for help.

It turns out he was there for a renewal.

My husband didn't stick around long enough to see if the guy got it. He valued his life too much. 




 At the time she probably couldn't tell the difference. Fuck broken ankles 




 Touche. 

But then, if by commenting, someone stops commenting "shitpost" then maybe I will have made a difference and maybe it is worthwhile.

Edit: Also, looking at the votes right now, I would humbly like to point out that people do seem to agree with me 




 Looking at your history OP, you seem to make a habit of reposting, then complaining that you didn't know it was a repost.

Well, either you are new to this game and have much to learn, or you are a dirty rotten liar.

I am going to go with liar, as you just tried to claim that Reese Lightening was just adopted by you. A lie.

So! I will just pick up my pitchfork here ---E and go stand with the gathering mob 




 I don't understand why people feel the need to comment "shitpost" on stuff they don't like. 

Don't like it? Downvote it. 

Just coz you call it a shitpost doesn't make it one, and doesn't mean other people agree with you. In fact, given the amount of upvotes, I would say your opinion is in the minority. 




 My sister has copped a lot of criticism for piercing her daughters' ears but honestly, if pierced ears are the worst thing she has done to her children, then they will still have had a pretty great childhood.

It bothers me how much people object to it in our society when there are larger issues to deal with. My nieces are happy, healthy and loved; people need to quit telling her she is a bad mother. 




 Somehow mine managed to come together...even after the celebrant had a heart attack 2 days out, my husband crashed his car a week out and my bmaid of honour forgot the ring in the limo.

Mind you, I was drunk for most of it, so not much could phase me 




 Well, being both married and a woman...not really the issue :/ 




 Seeing as I am a lady and all my tackle is always in the box.....no, it doesn't 




 Fair game 




 I got that constantly this weekend. Most of them hadn't seen me since I was a baby and yet they expected me to cry out with joy at the very sight of them.

"Lady, you could have easily walked in off the street for all I know!" 




 Now he ded 




 Example: We were staying at my cousins house who I thought I knew pretty well. Turned out he had a son from a previous relationship that I never knew about and people were pissed he wasn't there.

Also, I met my Uncle's first child fr another marriage...who I never knew existed. He knew me though... 




 Lol, no...Australia. But hey, our family breeds like rabbits, so.I might have family in Maine I don't know about

 I like how it says "Australians" as if we all did it as a collective.

 I sorta see what you want to get across but wanting to maintain a lifestyle because you enjoy it is not the "definition" of childish. 

On the flipside, having children and changing your lifestyle does not make you an adult 




 I understand that the need to fly with children may arise, but for the love of everyone's sanity, be prepared! 

These parents had no toys, no snacks, no medicine, nothing. They spent the whole trip just shushing the kid and trying to reason with him. He looked no older than 2 




 Yeah, but I got to immediately enjoy the wine in the Airport bar during my stopover, while I watched all the parents sit in the McDonald's chairs getting fries thrown at them. 

One day I might want kids, but it is not this day!

 I did tell him to open the box, just not what inside. He knew

 He was my normal teacher. He was really weird though. Several times he would gush over my worst work and then completely miss the point of my best. It wasn't until a year with him that I realised I could argue my case for a better grade and he would usually change his mind. Got mostly A's after that.

But thanks. I did work hard and I was really proud of the subtle (and more obvious) symbolism I had put into it. Ohh well...luckily I never wanted to be an artist

 I did an art project a lot like this in high school. The topic was Power, so I made a male torso out of metal, wood and clay, a female torso made of tissue paper and lace, and a cross. I made a box with a padlock and put it in the male's chest and hung the key around the cross. Inside the box was a bunch of stuff meant to symbolise the strength of women (pictures, quotes, etc).

It was meant to symbolise that men seemed to have power over women, but only through the power of the church.

I was so proud of my sculpture but my art teacher claimed he didn't "get it" and never even bothered opening the box or trying to understand. I got a C+.

He was Catholic. 




 My sister has 3 kids and 3 step kids, aged 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9 so visits to her house are....noisy. Everyone either hates eachother and won't shut up or love eachother and won't calm down. I was lucky to just be on holiday with the youngest this week. I don't think I would have survived the hoarde.

But she was pretty vocal alone. Any question you asked her was answered with "No" until she realised what you were asking...and then it was a little whinge for not getting the thing she just said No to

 I really don't think it is misleading. I am saying it is uncommon to hear about female vs female domestic violence.

I guess if people are feeling misled, they coild just read all these comments and know the facts 




 Geniuses, duh 




 No, I don't think I will. It is still uncommon in my society to hear about a case like this. Like I said, this was the first I had heard of a case like it...in recent news at least.

These are the kind of stats often quoted:

http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/rip/1-10/07.html

There seems to be disagreement with numbers tho. Some say it is mostly male vs female, but others say it is about even 




 I feel it would be less subtle if they had a guy out front who punches you in the face then gives you a flyer 




 Sorry, I was not aware of those stats. In our news lately, there has been massive coverage of particularly violent domestic abuse cases (a handful of women have died recently). New measures, task groups, charities and workplace allowances seem to be springing up every day to help. To help *women* escaping their abusive *male* partners. I have not once heard mention of a female being an abuser until this article, which is why it struck me as uncommon.

 Geez, my husband won't leave me alone! I can't get changed in the mornings or afternoons without him leaping out from behind a wall and honking them.

You need to up your honking game. Make your wife *afraid* to get changed. So much so that she has to look over her shoulder every time she takes off her bra.
