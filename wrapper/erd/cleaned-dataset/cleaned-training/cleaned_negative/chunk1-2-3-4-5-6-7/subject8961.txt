 Someone's education shouldn't determine if a person can run for any political office or how good they'd do. Anyone can run for office from a person who works at Wal Mart with a high school diploma to a professor with a PhD. I won't be supporting Scott Walker but his education shouldn't be as big of a deal everyone is making it out to be.

 I was reading a book about the battle when I thought of the question. I took to researching about why, but never found a solid answer.  














 Did anyone else see the fireball south/southwest of the Islands? The time spotted was between 5:15a.m. to 5:40 a.m.  I was wondering if anyone knows any information to what it was.  









 Does anyone else have a problem with their internet while playing world of tanks? Both my buddy and myself have had problems with our internet while playing this particular game.  




 Does anyone know what army regulation states that you don't have to buy equipment that you weren't issued? One of my co-workers had found it before, but it's been so long no one remembers it.  




 Does anyone know how to get stationed here? Also could you give me a break down of how everyday is at this duty station?  




 Would a website that you could rate your leadership be a good idea? I noticed how sometimes good leaders aren't recognized and toxic leaders fly under the radar. If there were a website that let everyone know how good of a leader they actually were would it help the problem? How would you stop reviews from becoming spammed by grudges or vendettas?  


































 Can you change your major? If you did would you have more hope? 




 What is holding you back? 




 A blue Hawaiian or New Jersey turnpike.  



















 Italy  




 They may be still exchanging fire during a ceasefire but at least they're making some progress.  



















 I don't know, I was farley drunk myself.  




 Ron Paul.  









 High school, because it was simple, easy, and fun.  




 Idk my friends and dad were stationed in Alaska. It wasn't suggested as much. 









 God damn Mongolians keep destrying my shii wall.  




 What lead to becoming lower class? Also married 3 times, would you know why they would do that? 









 Until people learn exactly what the budget is spent on. ~12 billion on uniform development. ~400 billion on the F35 ~2 billion for the land warrior system that isn't used. Ect..... 




 They probably hung out as kids, and made a bet of who can be the bigger asshole.  




 Because I don't like commitment 




 Awesome, I like how they give a breakdown of how it works.  




 It did a great job in showing war deprevation and brutality. It didn't do that good with reality in the final battle.  




 They're going to be bored watching my dot stay in my house all day.  




 I think congress needs a few fist fights.  




 Roaring twenties. Everyone dresses up, decorate like a speakeasy.  









 If it's a debate for fun I'd go with "who'd win a grizzly bear or a silver back gorilla" "who's the better western actor John Wayne or Clint Eastwood?"    For something serious I'd talk about which European country has the best economy/government. Who's worse the Mexican Cartel or Terrorists? You could even go with which presidential candidate is best for America.  




 I don't really have a reason why I give I just do. Especially to the people with signs like "using the money for alcohol". If they're being honest they might as well get a few dollars.  




 I'm sitting here in an empty house, watching documentaries on Netflix, about the economy.  




 North and South Korea conjoin to become the number 1 country against the fight on hunger.  




 Looks like coke is losing the next marketing war.  














 The only people that would have homemade explosives are the guys with the "tanks". I don't think they're worried too much. Could you imagine if narcos started using IED like attacks though? 



















 Going to college 




 They'll defeat their enemies with laughter.  




 Because we're using all of our resources and money to police the world. Instead of working on building a better America we're working to change people's ideals across the world.  We're also being destroyed internally by drugs which the majority comes from Mexico because they refuse to make the boarder harder to cross.  









 Astronaut door gunner  




 Just sitting there on his phone all day.  









 Limiting, it'd be easier for me to just not use my car than not eat.  




 Anything is more productive than fasting.  




 It's good they show care for the environment but fasting isn't going to do much. Instead they could go on a 40 day planting campaign, a 40 day cleaning/recycling outdoor areas, or raise some money for non profit environmental organizations. That would do more for the environment than fasting.  









 The mexican cartel killing America citizens.  
























 The abomination 




 It's just frowned upon

 Didn't they say that last year and the year before. Most likely it's because their numbers are down because ISIS is attracting all the jihadists.

 I gave a guy that claimed he was in the military 250. He asked for it saying he was stuck downtown and couldn't get back to post. I definitely didn't think he was in the military  but it doesn't bother me.

 Drink someone's spinal fluid as a water replacement.  




 Terrorist fighting terrorists. That's how much ISIS is hated in the world.

 I'm a independent voter. I like politicians from both parties. I haven't found anyone that's solid yet to support, follow, and potentially vote for.  




 Hate mail.  




 Everyone meets up at a known spot in town. Split the teams up between cops and fugitives. The fugitives must go on foot to a safe point across town. When the game starts the cops drive their cars to the safe spot, turn around and look for the fugitives. The cops must leave the car and tag a fugitive. If you get tagged you become a cop, if you make it to the safe spot you're just safe.  




 Fugitive. Still the best game I've ever played.  




 Penguin. Who wouldn't be entertained with some animal in a suit waddling around the house.  




 Are you serious, this has asked 4 times within the last hour.  




 It's like after WW2 Europe was in ruins, but at least they had all these countries helping to rebuild. Who's going to rebuild Syria? I believe their country will be permanently in ruins.  




 You look at these images and realize. Whoever ends up wining the war isn't going to have anything to rule over.
